Actually, Tsunku, who was in the final fighting field in Hawaii, came to cheer and talked about the encouragement of Tsunku who was a teacher who <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> as an idol and a big eating talent became more encouraged and later talked on her blog to have.|$|E
500|$|Robin Hester {{played by}} Benjamin Jay, was a {{teenager}} who formed a crush on Sunny and tried to ruin her relationship with Zeke. Digital Spy said Robin [...] "goes to drastic lengths to keep Zeke and Sunny apart" [...] and Holy Soap and Jay labelled him as [...] "creepy". Robin was seen trying to manipulate Sunny and he locked Zeke in a store cupboard, so he could spend time with her. Lee named the storyline with Robin as her favourite from her time in the show. She said [...] "That {{was probably the best}} storyline ever because it <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to show who Sunny Lee was".|$|E
500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable aspect of Johnson's game was his {{blocking}} abilities, for which he received heavy praise. He took pride in it, saying [...] "It <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to hit {{all those people who}} hit me all the time." [...] Quarterback Bobby Layne, a teammate of Johnson with both the Lions and Steelers, listed Johnson as one of the one of [...] "Pro Football's 11 Meanest Men" [...] in an article for SPORT magazine in 1964. [...] "By 'mean,' I mean vicious, unmanageable, consistently tough," [...] said Layne. [...] "I don't mean dirty." [...] Layne also called Johnson his [...] "bodyguard," [...] saying [...] "Half the good runners will get a passer killed if you keep them around long enough. But a quarterback hits the jackpot when he gets a combination runner-blocker like Johnson." ...|$|E

500|$|The main theme {{emphasized}} in the series is the environment. Holmes says that by [...] "coming up with a series about a different animal <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to explore some themes that don't fit so easily into Warriors. In particular, the environment." [...] Holmes says that {{she has always been}} keen on recycling and saving the planet so she wanted to explore the ways bears and other animals might react to humans destroying their homes and habitats. Many reviewers have picked up the theme. Publishers Weekly found that [...] "readers will appreciate the bears' struggle to survive, along with Hunter's environmental theme." [...] Booklist also commented on each separate story of the three bears touch on environmental problems and issues. School Library Journal noted that [...] "The bears' declining habitat is evident, and often throughout their journey the animals have to dodge cars and humans with guns." ...|$|E
500|$|The transfer, in 2007, {{coincided with}} an upturn in Ebsary's career. After {{a slow start}} in the new WNCL season—Western Australia lost their first five matches—Ebsary became more productive. She scored 30 of 141 and took 1/16 in a low-scoring win over New South Wales in the sixth match. In the last double-header of the season, against Queensland, she made {{consecutive}} half-centuries {{for the first time}} in her career. In the first match she made 72 before taking 4/46 to help secure a 104-run win, before scoring 62 the next day to lay the foundation for a five-wicket win. Ebsary scored 236 runs at 29.50; her previous best WNCL aggregate was 149. However, she did have trouble in running between the wickets; three of her eight dismissals were run outs. She took eight wickets at 33.87 at an economy rate of 4.43 and had a workload more than 50% heavier than in previous seasons. Ebsary was not as successful in the fledgling Twenty20 format; in two matches for the season, her first in the most abbreviated form of cricket, she scored 33 runs at 16.50 and conceded 51 runs at an economy rate of 7.46 without taking a wicket. Ebsary later said [...] "Looking back, the move to the West has been the best thing for my cricket...After settling our line-up, it <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to let loose at the top of the order and helped my confidence to be aggressive at the batting crease...Under the leadership of Avril Fahey, the West Aussies were very welcoming and I found my groove at the top of the order." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reactions from {{grassroots}} {{supporters who}} lack political organisation have been muted. A woman who benefited from Thaksin populist policies said [...] "He <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{to keep my}} daughter alive. He gave us food {{when we were in}} need. Now that he's been chased out, the poor have lost their closest friend.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Rahane {{was widely}} {{regarded}} as not being a Twenty20 player going into 2012 Indian Premier League, but had a superb season for Rajasthan Royals. Previously {{he was in the}} Mumbai Indians squads and got limited opportunities. And then, he caught the eye of Rajasthan Royals' Shane Watson, who had watched him score an 80-ball hundred in a session in the second innings of a three-day game against Australia A in 2010. Having bought him from the Mumbai Indians, Rahul Dravid and Watson got Rahane to open the innings. [...] "Opening the batting with Rahul bhai <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to express myself and showcase all that I had learnt over the years," [...] Rahane explained.|$|E
2500|$|We heard {{something}} was wrong with my dad during the [...] World Cup. He started feeling unwell and then, out of the blue, we were told he only had a few months to live. It was a huge shock because we've always been a very close family. I missed the first couple of Tests in England that year so I could be at home with him. It was obviously the saddest time of my life but those last weeks were maybe some of the most beautiful. It <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to say thank you and goodbye. After a while I realised how lucky I was to do that. It's far harder if a parent is taken away before you have that time together. So his death put cricket in perspective for me. It's just a game – and a very simple game if you keep your mind straight.|$|E
60|$|He didn't say a word. I {{wanted to}} comfort him, {{but he never}} <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance.</b> He never {{mentioned}} Lucy's name.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{the delay}} won't worry me," [...] {{answered}} the scientist, calmly. [...] "It will <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{to see something}} of another part of Greenland." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is what I {{want to tell}} you, Anne, if you'll ever <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to get <b>a</b> word in edgewise. She {{was talking}} about you." ...|$|R

60|$|He was a German, {{and had a}} {{hare-lip}} and a most seductive gentleness of voice. I gladly {{make him}} historical. He sold me the Blue Rat, and <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to study {{a new type of}} horse.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll be snowbound and no mistake," [...] {{observed}} Andy. [...] "Well, I don't care much; it will <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{to catch}} up in my lessons." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At any rate, he <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to-day; you know, I suppose, that he {{sent for}} <b>me</b> to attend <b>a</b> {{consultation}} of his officers on important matters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{will have}} a pretty hard try anyhow,” the man said. “I will roll this tub under it; that will <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of using my strength.” ...|$|R
6000|$|His aunt Polly {{was knocked}} so stupid and {{so mad at}} the cold impudence of it that she couldn't say a word {{for as much as}} a half a minute, and this <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to nudge Tom and whisper: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want to ask}} you something," [...] he went on. [...] "I've {{been wanting}} to know something. That's why I've hung on here. You never spoke to me, never noticed me, never <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to ask you. But now I'm going over--over the border. And I want to know. Why did you refuse to listen to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was afraid}} too," [...] Luka said. [...] "I {{was just going}} to shoot again when you struck him on the nose, and so <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of hitting him in a vital spot. If it hadn't been for your blow I should hardly have stopped him; he was so close that even if I wounded him mortally he would have come down on the boat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm sick {{of trying}} to please Maginnis. What's the good? He never <b>gives</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> in London. I'm sick of being always on tour. I'm sick of everything.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Come, come!" [...] he said. [...] "I {{want to have}} a {{few words}} with Brooks myself, if you girls'll <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance.</b> Heard {{anything}} from Henslow lately, eh?" ...|$|R
60|$|WHAT with {{lying on}} the rocks four days at Louisville, and some other delays, the poor old 'Paul Jones' fooled away about two weeks in making the voyage from Cincinnati to New Orleans. This <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to get acquainted {{with one of the}} pilots, and {{he taught me how to}} steer the boat, and thus made the fascination of river life more potent than ever for me.|$|E
6000|$|It also <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to get {{acquainted with}} a youth {{who had taken}} deck passage--more's the pity; for he easily {{borrowed}} six dollars of me on a promise {{to return to the}} boat and pay it back to me the day after we should arrive. But he probably died or forgot, for he never came. It was doubtless the former, since he had said his parents were wealthy, and he only traveled deck passage because it was cooler.{footnote [1. 'Deck' Passage, i.e. steerage passage.]} ...|$|E
60|$|The {{captain and}} the two {{passengers}} kept diaries. On our voyage to San Francisco we ran into a calm {{in the middle of}} the Pacific, and did not move a rod during fourteen days; this <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to copy the diaries. Samuel Ferguson's is the fullest; I will draw upon it now. When the following paragraph was written the doomed ship was about one hundred and twenty days out from port, and all hands were putting in the lazy time about as usual, as no one was forecasting disaster.|$|E
6000|$|... "He didn't <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{to speak}} to him. He and Guardley {{disappeared}} in the crowd like a flash. I rather think they saw me and avoided me." ...|$|R
