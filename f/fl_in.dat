5|$|The Atlantic Coast Conference Men's Basketball Coach of the Year is a {{basketball}} award given to head {{coaches in the}} Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The award is granted to the head coach voted {{to be the most}} successful that season by members of the Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association, and since the 2012–13 season has also been awarded in separate voting by the league's coaches. The award was first given following the 1953–54season, {{the first year of the}} conference's existence, to Everett Case of NC State. The first winner of the coaches' award was Jim Larrañaga of Miami (<b>FL)</b> <b>in</b> 2013.|$|E

This paper examines the expectations that FLs operate through the COO effect (Study 1), and that they evoke associations (Study 2) and generate persuasive effects (Study 3) similar to COO mentions. The findings of the studies, employing different language slogans for different products, lend support to these expectations. Thus, <b>FLs</b> <b>in</b> advertising derive their effectiveness from the COO effect, and practitioners can use them to benefit from this effect...|$|R

It was at this point Bowman left the band, though he returned several months later just after the recording of Crime as Forgiven by Against Me!. On April 23, 2001; while traveling south on I-75, heading home from their first tour as a 4 piece band, their van was hit by a semi truck. They landed upside down in a ditch.

40|$|Vertebrate morphologists {{often are}} {{interested}} in inferring limb-loading patterns in animals characterized by different locomotor repertoires. Because bone apparent density (i. e. mass per unit volume of bone inclusive of porosities) is a determinant of compressive strength, and thus indicative of compressive loading, recent comparative studies in primates have proposed a structure–function relationship between apparent density of subchondral bone and locomotor behaviours that vary in compressive loading. If such patterns are found in other mammals, then these relationships would be strengthened further. Here, we examine the distal radius of suspensory sloths that generally load their forelimbs (<b>FLs)</b> <b>in</b> tension and of quadrupedal anteaters that generally load their <b>FLs</b> <b>in</b> compression. Computed tomography osteoabsorptiometry was used to visualize the patterns in subchondral apparent density. Suspensory sloths exhibit relatively smaller areas of high apparent density than quadrupedal anteaters. This locomotor-based pattern {{is analogous to the}} pattern observed in suspensory and quadrupedal primates. Similarity between xenarthran and primate trends suggests broad-scale applicability for analysing subchondral bone apparent density and supports the idea that bone functionally alters its material properties in response to locomotor behaviours...|$|R

30|$|This is {{the first}} {{demonstration}} of a striking discordance between 18  F-FLT uptake <b>in</b> <b>FL</b> and tumour cell proliferation. High expression of DNA replication and repair markers compared with the pure proliferation marker MIB- 1 <b>in</b> <b>FL</b> suggests that this discordance {{might be due to}} error-prone DNA repair. While DNA repair-related 18  F-FLT uptake considerably contributes to 18  F-FLT uptake <b>in</b> <b>FL,</b> its contribution to 18  F-FLT uptake in highly proliferative DLBCL is small. This apparently high contribution of DNA repair to the 18  F-FLT signal <b>in</b> <b>FL</b> may hamper studies where 18  F-FLT is used to assess response to cytostatic therapy or to distinguish between FL and transformed lymphoma.|$|R
