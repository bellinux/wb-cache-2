40|$|Lecturepg. 41 Monitoring {{vibration}} as a {{predictive maintenance}} tool will not consistently prevent catastrophic damage and/or fluid release from sealess pumps. When vibration readings are taken periodically, a pump may be destroyed between monitoring schedules. Using acceleration {{to monitor the}} <b>internal</b> <b>rotor</b> of a sealess pump does not {{work as well as}} it does on a sealed pump configuration. There are several reasons for this. First, the <b>internal</b> <b>rotor</b> mass is relatively low when compared {{to the rest of the}} pump. The external mass dampens the vibration signal and a clear interpretation is not always possible. Second, vibration generated by inconsistent fluid flow during abnormal operating conditions can create confusing vibration amplitudes. Thirds, sealess pumps are relatively new and experience with vibration interpretation is limited. Monitoring sealess pumps by means other than vibration are generally reactionary, such as indicating the presence of liquid where none should be or detecting the conditions that will result in <b>internal</b> <b>rotor</b> damage. Also, some devices that monitor <b>internal</b> <b>rotor</b> condition create an additional leak path from the pump to atmosphere. <b>Internal</b> <b>rotor</b> monitoring methods generally rely on ?wearing through something? to create a signal that is detectable outside of the pump. The signal is representative of the remaining bearing life. These methods are not effective unless the internal pump wear is uniform over time. This uniformity is often lacking, because the process fluid cools and lubricates the inside of the pump and periods to reach wear limits often vary. All of the wear could have taken place in the last hour, even if the pump has been running for the last 12 months...|$|E

40|$|Previously {{reported}} {{experimental results}} indicate that photooxygenation of homochiral N-(hydroxyalkyl) - 2 -methylpyrroles with singlet oxygen yields transrather than cis-bicyclic lactams as the major product. In this study, the origin of selectivity in this reaction has been investigated with computational methods. Relative stabilities of homochiral N-(hydroxyalkyl) - 2 -methylpyrrole conformers and their effect on pi-facial selectivity of O- 1 (2) were extensively studied. Stepwise and concerted reaction mechanisms, starting from the endoperoxide intermediates, were proposed and modeled in vacuum using the UB 3 LYP method with the 6 - 31 +G** basis set. Solvent calculations were carried out in CH 2 Cl 2, {{by means of the}} integral equation formalism-polarizable continuum model (IEF-PCM) at the UB 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 +G** level of theory. Free energies of activation leading to both diastereomers were analyzed in an effort to explain the stereoselectivity and product distribution. Steric interactions among the pyrrole substituents were shown to lead to a rotational barrier higher than 10 kcal/mol. Hence, hindered internal rotation is suggested to cause one pyrrole conformer to be substantially overpopulated. This in turn has a major effect on pi-facial selectivity of O- 1 (2), thereby favoring one endoperoxide over the other and leading to the diastereoselective synthesis o trans-pyrrolooxazolones. The importance of hindered <b>internal</b> <b>rotors,</b> for an accurate calculation of the frequency factors of a chemical reaction, has already been mentioned in the literature many times; however, in this work hindered <b>internal</b> <b>rotors</b> also seem to dictate the diastereoselective outcome of the reaction...|$|R
