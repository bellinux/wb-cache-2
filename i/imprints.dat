The effect of the roller tooth’s taper angle, <b>imprint</b> depth, <b>imprint</b> temperature, and <b>imprint</b> direction on the <b>imprint</b> force, adhesion, stress distribution, and strain are investigated.

40|$|Parent-of-origin {{dependent}} {{gene expression}} associated with genomic <b>imprinting</b> {{is expected to}} result in the phenotypic signature of {{a difference between the}} average phenotypes of the reciprocal heterozygotes. Quantitative genetic mapping approaches have exploited this phenotypic manifestation to identify putatively <b>imprinted</b> loci affecting the expression of 'complex' traits. By focusing on the phenotypic consequences of <b>imprinting,</b> quantitative mapping techniques enable us to rapidly scan the genome for <b>imprinted</b> loci. Such genome-wide scans can be used to identify the array of pleiotropic effects of <b>imprinted</b> loci and to establish associated <b>imprinting</b> patterns including partial <b>imprinting</b> and more complex <b>imprinting</b> patterns, such as polar overdominance. Moreover, quantitative mapping makes no assumptions about underlying mechanisms of parent-of-origin-dependent effects and can thus help identifying alternative mechanisms causing <b>imprinted</b> expression. Thus, we suggest that phenotype-based mapping approaches can significantly advance our understanding of various aspects of genomic <b>imprinting,</b> especially when integrated with other molecular or bioinformatic approaches...|$|R

40|$|Genomic <b>imprinting</b> is an {{epigenetic}} mechanism {{resulting in}} parental allele-specific gene expression. Defects in normal <b>imprinting</b> {{are found in}} cancer, assisted reproductive technologies, and several human syndromes. In mouse models, germline-derived DNA methylation is shown to regulate <b>imprinting.</b> Though <b>imprinting</b> is largely conserved between mammals, species- and tissue-specific domains of <b>imprinted</b> expression exist. Using the cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) to assess primate-specific <b>imprinting,</b> we present a comprehensive view of tissue-specific <b>imprinted</b> expression and DNA methylation at established <b>imprinted</b> gene clusters. For example, like mouse and unlike human, macaque IGF 2 R is consistently <b>imprinted,</b> and the PLAGL 1, INPP 5 F transcript variant 2, and PEG 3 <b>imprinting</b> control regions are not methylated in the macaque germline but acquire this post-fertilization.

40|$|Genomic <b>imprinting</b> is an {{epigenetic}} {{phenomenon that}} causes a differential expression of paternally and maternally inherited alleles of {{a subset of}} genes (the so-called <b>imprinted</b> genes). <b>Imprinted</b> genes are distributed throughout the genome and it is predicted that about 1 % of the human genes may be <b>imprinted.</b> It is recognized that the allelic expression of <b>imprinted</b> genes varies between tissues and developmental stages. The current study represents the first attempt to estimate a prevalence of <b>imprinted</b> genes within the total human transcriptome.

5|$|The first mammals (in Kemp's sense) {{appeared}} in the Late Triassic epoch (about 225 million years ago), 40 million {{years after the first}} therapsids. They expanded out of their nocturnal insectivore niche from the mid-Jurassic onwards; The Jurassic Castorocauda, for example, was a near-relative of true mammals that had adaptations for swimming, digging and catching fish. Most, if not all, are thought to have remained nocturnal (the Nocturnal bottleneck), accounting for much of the typical mammalian traits. The majority of the mammal species that existed in the Mesozoic Era were multituberculates, eutriconodonts and spalacotheriids.

5|$|Of Tchaikovsky's Western contemporaries, Robert Schumann {{stands out}} as an {{influence}} in formal structure, harmonic practices and piano writing, according to Brown and musicologist Roland John Wiley. As mentioned earlier, Asafyev comments that Schumann left his mark on Tchaikovsky {{not just as a}} formal influence but also as an example of musical dramaturgy and self-expression. Leon Botstein claims the music of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner also left their <b>imprints</b> on Tchaikovsky's orchestral style. The late-Romantic trend for writing orchestral suites, begun by Franz Lachner, Jules Massenet, and Joachim Raff after the rediscovery of Bach's works in that genre, may have influenced Tchaikovsky to try his own hand at them. His teacher Anton Rubinstein's opera The Demon became a model for the final tableau of Eugene Onegin. So did Léo Delibes' ballets Coppélia and Sylvia for The Sleeping Beauty and Georges Bizet's opera Carmen (a work Tchaikovsky admired tremendously) for The Queen of Spades. Otherwise, it was to composers of the past that Tchaikovsky turned—Beethoven, whose music he respected; Mozart, whose music he loved; Glinka, whose opera A Life for the Tsar made an indelible impression on him as a child and whose scoring he studied assiduously; and Adolphe Adam, whose ballet Giselle was a favorite of his from his student days and whose score he consulted while working on The Sleeping Beauty. Beethoven's string quartets may have influenced Tchaikovsky's attempts in that medium. Other composers whose work interested Tchaikovsky included Hector Berlioz, Felix Mendelssohn, Giacomo Meyerbeer, and Henry Litolff.|$|E

40|$|In plants, {{a subset}} of genes exhibit <b>imprinting</b> in {{endosperm}} tissue such that expression is primarily from the maternal or paternal allele. <b>Imprinting</b> may arise {{as a consequence of}} mechanisms for silencing of transposons during reproduction, and in some cases <b>imprinted</b> expression of particular genes may provide a selective advantage such that it is conserved across species. Separate mechanisms for the origin of <b>imprinted</b> expression patterns and maintenance of these patterns may result in substantial variation in the targets of <b>imprinting</b> in different species. Here we present deep sequencing of RNAs isolated from reciprocal crosses of four diverse maize genotypes, providing a comprehensive analysis of <b>imprinting</b> in maize that allows evaluation of <b>imprinting</b> at more than 95 % of endosperm-expressed genes. We find that over 500 genes exhibit statistically significant parent-of-origin effects in maize endosperm tissue, but focused our analyses on {{a subset of}} these genes that had > 90 % expression from the maternal allele (69 genes) or from the paternal allele (108 genes) in at least one reciprocal cross. Over 10 % of <b>imprinted</b> genes show evidence of allelic variation for <b>imprinting.</b> A comparison of <b>imprinting</b> in maize and rice reveals that only 13 % of genes with syntenic orthologs in both species exhibit conserved <b>imprinting.</b> Genes that exhibit conserved <b>imprinting</b> in maize relative to rice have elevated dN/dS ratios compared to other <b>imprinted</b> genes, suggesting a history of more rapid evolution.

40|$|Genomic <b>imprinting</b> is an {{epigenetic}} {{mechanism that}} results in monoallelic expression of genes depending on parent-of-origin of the allele.

Comparative analysis of genomic <b>imprinting</b> across mammalian species would provide a powerful tool for elucidating the mechanisms regulating the unique expression of <b>imprinted</b> genes.

40|$|Abstract: As a {{field of}} study, genomic <b>imprinting</b> has grown rapidly in the last 20 years, with a growing figure of around 100 <b>imprinted</b> genes known in the mouse and {{approximately}} 50 in the human. The <b>imprinted</b> expression of genes may be transient and highly tissue-specific, and there are potentially hundreds of other, as yet undiscovered, <b>imprinted</b> transcripts. The placenta is notable amongst mammalian organs for its high and prolific expression of <b>imprinted</b> genes. This review discusses {{the development of the}} human placenta and focuses on the function of <b>imprinting</b> in this organ. <b>Imprinting</b> is potentially a mechanism to balance parental resource allocation and it {{plays an important role in}} growth. The placenta, as the interface between mother and fetus, is central to prenatal growth control. The expression of genes subject to parental allelic expression bias has, over the years, been shown to be essential for the normal development and physiology of the placenta. In this review we also discuss the significance of genes that lack conservation of <b>imprinting</b> between mice and humans, genes whose <b>imprinted</b> expression is often placentalspecific. Finally, we illustrate the importance of <b>imprinting</b> in the postnatal human in terms of several human <b>imprinting</b> disorders, with consideration of the brain as a key organ for <b>imprinted</b> gene expression after birth...|$|R
