500|$|When Simone {{returned}} to the United States, she learned that a warrant had been issued for her arrest for unpaid taxes (as a protest against her country's involvement with the Vietnam War), and {{returned to}} Barbados to evade the authorities and prosecution. Simone stayed in Barbados {{for quite some time}} and she had a lengthy affair with the Prime Minister, Errol Barrow. A close friend, singer Miriam Makeba, then persuaded her to go to Liberia. Later, she lived in Switzerland and the Netherlands, before settling in France in 1993. During a 1998 performance in Newark, she announced, [...] "If you're going to come see me again, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to France, because I ain't coming back." ...|$|E

500|$|On August 31, Tancredo shifted {{momentarily}} {{to a new}} issue. On {{the two-year}} anniversary of the landfall of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, he called for funds to be withdrawn and federal aid be cut off for the recovery effort. He remarked that it was time, [...] "the taxpayer gravy train left the New Orleans station." [...] The move was perhaps a step for the candidate to woo fiscal conservatives and advocates for states' rights, commenting that [...] "at some point, {{state and local officials}} and individuals have got {{to step up to the}} plate and take some initiative, the mentality that people can wait around indefinitely for the federal taxpayer to solve all their worldly problems has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to an end." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the deputies}} {{went into the}} basement, he was asked by Arnaud to come with him, who said to him, [...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and go with me now." [...] However, Logan adamantly refused, saying [...] "I told you, I'm not going with you anywhere". Logan then ran up the {{staircase}} and went into his former bedroom, now used as a guest bedroom, and closed the door. Arnaud and Magruder {{followed him to the}} room and stood outside the door. Arnaud tried to convince Logan {{to come out of the}} room, as Logan's parents and Magruder, who had joined the department in February 2001, stood by, watching. After Logan's parents left the scene and went to the house's master bedroom, Logan became belligerent and uncooperative. Partially hidden behind a closet door, Logan retrieved a semi-automatic 9mm-chambered handgun and fired at Arnaud, where a bullet struck him in the throat and severed his carotid artery. Logan then shot Arnaud fatally in the chest.|$|E
500|$|On July 2, 2007, Washington {{appeared}} on Larry King Live, {{to present his}} side of the controversy. According to Washington, he never used the [...] "F Word" [...] in reference to Knight, but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument [...] "provoked" [...] by Dempsey, who he felt was treating him like a [...] "B-word", a [...] "P-word", and the [...] "F-word", which Washington said conveyed [...] "somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back". In 2009, Rhimes told Entertainment Weekly that she may not have handled the incident correctly, stating: [...] "I wasn't interested in what anybody thought publicly. I was interested in what was going on right here on the ground...with the people I work with every day. Did I do it perfectly? Of course not. This is my first television show. It was a learning experience." [...] Knight said that Rhimes was among those for discouraging him to come out, however Rhimes said: [...] "I remember saying , 'This is our proudest day here. T.R. <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out and I got to say to him that it wouldn't affect his character' because he was concerned he was going to come out and George would suddenly be gay. [...] The idea that a gay actor can't play a straight man is insulting." ...|$|E

500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the segment Bender stated, [...] "The big climactic cave sequence was hugely complex, and although it's very scary that this really terrifying thing is happening to our characters, {{at the end of the}} day I think the emotion from what we are experiencing is hopefully going to be the shock that people will stay with," [...] referring to Hodor's implied death. In an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor), he described filming the scene, [...] "It was a really heavy day — you’ve got these 100-mile-per-hour winds being blown into your face with false snow. I was really holding the door — there were like eight people pushing from the other side and I was really holding them back. It’s definitely Method acting. It was a very intense day but one of the nice things was they let Isaac wrap me. He <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> over and say [...] "Mr. Nairn, that’s a wrap." [...] It was very emotional. It’s always been a little group of us together and it felt like our little group was breaking up." [...] Ellie Kendrick (Meera Reed) spoke about the filming of her part of the sequence, saying [...] "A lot of what's happening in that scene, in Meera's head, comes down to adrenaline. There's just no way she can stop and consider logically what's happening. If you have an army of the undead chasing after you, you're only going to be thinking one thing: [...] "Run!" [...] It was interesting, having the challenge of creating that adrenaline and fear and sadness of Hodor, but not being able to process it at all. Having to recreate that feeling of immediacy, in a stuffy studio at 4 p.m. on a Thursday when you've been filming the same scene for a couple of days, it was difficult. But it was an exciting challenge, to constantly inject the energy those characters must be feeling in that moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{rejects the}} label of [...] "African-American", calling himself [...] "an American of African descent". He said he is proud of his heritage, but says [...] "I just think we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{together}} as Americans, as one family.

Albert explained: [...] "If you're on a summer holiday, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{at this time of}} year. I've always wanted to come to Graceland. Charlene and my friends wanted to be here today for this visit, Elvis touched our lives as well and the lives of so many people. We wanted to pay our respects and see what this place was all about." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the lyrical {{content of}} Mirror Ball, Young said, [...] "There's idealism and reality, {{the two have}} <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{together}} yet there are always major problems when they do. Maybe that's the crux of what I'm trying to say in this new album. It's also a commentary {{of the differences between}} my peace and love '60s generation and the more cynical '90s generation." [...] "Song X" [...] and [...] "Act of Love" [...] were written about abortion. [...] "Downtown" [...] includes references to Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin. The reference to Led Zeppelin was partly inspired by Young's performance with the band at the 1995 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|With a {{contract}} extension with the Mariners unknown, Ichiro stated, [...] "It's going to go both ways. It can't just come from the player. It's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from the team, too. If the team is saying they need you, you're necessary, then it becomes a piece. But if it's just coming from the player, it's not going to happen." [...] Ichiro's agent, Tony Attanasio, said, [...] "He knows that the club has to grow. He knows they {{have to play the}} younger guys and get them more playing time. The only way he knows {{to do that is to}} move on. He doesn't want to stop playing. He wants to continue." ...|$|E

2500|$|Diamond's dances were {{characterized}} by little upper-body movement and rapid footwork. He left his upper body relaxed so as to bring attention to his feet. One characteristic step was to lean forward and dangle his hands loosely, look to the side, and slide across the stage with a heel–toe alternation. Noah M. Ludlow, a theatre manager, wrote that [...] "He could twist his feet and legs, while dancing, into more fantastic forms than I ever witnessed before or since in any human being." [...] His playbills proclaimed Diamond a performer of [...] "the greatest display of heel and toe genus [...] ever witnessed" [...] and that [...] "Now de heels, if dares any music in you, its [...] <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out". Diamond's rapid footwork rapped out percussive patterns on the floor. He advertised that he could create music with his heels.|$|E
2500|$|... {{trying to}} make it as big as possible... my band gets {{involved}} in some of the choreography. It's amazing that everybody sort of gets involved. We're all such teammates with each other when we're on that stage and we just all have such fun together. [...] And then we go into sort of a juke joint feel where we kind of you know, slash that with going to church [...] And then we open it up to a circus element (scene), so there's a – so there's quite a journey that goes on, on stage for my audience and as a performer. [...] But it all does have a tie together, so it all kind of makes sense. [...] You really just <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> see the show, all right. It's so much fun to put on and we have a blast with it".|$|E
2500|$|Also on 24 July, after Berchtold {{met with}} the Russian chargé d'affaires, furious {{complaints}} were prompted from Berlin, warning that Austria should not engage in talks with any other powers in case a compromise might be worked out. That same day, Wilhelm wrote on the margin of a dispatch from Count Tschirschky, calling Austria-Hungary [...] "weak" [...] for not being aggressive enough in the Balkans, and writing that alteration in the power in the Balkans [...] "has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Austria must become predominant in the Balkans {{as compared to the}} little ones, and at Russia’s expense." [...] Count Szögyény reported to Vienna that [...] "here, it is generally taken for granted that if Serbia rejects our demands, we shall at once reply by declaring war, and opening military operations. We are advised... to confront the world with a fait accompli (emphasis in the original)." [...] When the German ambassador in Belgrade reported how sad the Serbian people were with being faced with the choice of either war or national humiliation, Wilhelm wrote on the margins of the report: [...] "Bravo! One would not have believed it of the Viennese!... How hollow the whole Serbian power is proving itself to be; thus, it is seen to be with all the Slav nations! Just tread hard on the heels of that rabble!" ...|$|E
