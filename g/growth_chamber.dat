50|$|Hydrothermal {{synthesis}} can {{be defined}} as a method of synthesis of single crystals that depends on the solubility of minerals in hot water under high pressure.

Cryogenic temperatures act as a sink for impurities in the vacuum, so vacuum levels need to be several orders of magnitude better to deposit films under these conditions. In other systems, the wafers on which the crystals are grown may be mounted on a rotating platter which can be heated to several hundred degrees Celsius during operation.|$|E

40|$|Wheat is {{increasingly}} {{used as a}} dual-purpose crop (for forage and grain production) worldwide. Plants encounter low temperatures in winter, which commonly results in sugar accumulation. High sugar levels might {{have a positive impact}} on forage digestibility, but may also lead to an increased risk of bloat. We hypothesized that cultivars with a lower capacity to accumulate sugars when grown under cold conditions may have a lower bloat risk than higher sugar-accumulating genotypes, without showing significantly lower forage digestibility. This possibility was studied using two wheat cultivars with contrasting sugar accumulation at low temperature. A series of experiments with contrasting temperatures were performed in controlled-temperature field enclosures (three experiments) and <b>growth</b> <b>chambers</b> (two experiments). Plants were grown at either cool (8. 1 °C– 9. 3 °C) or warm (15. 7 °C– 16. 5 °C) conditions in field enclosures, and at either 5 °C or 25 °C in <b>growth</b> <b>chambers.</b> An additional treatment consisted of transferring plants from cool to warm conditions in the field enclosures and from 5 °C to 25 °C in the <b>growth</b> <b>chambers.</b> The plants in the field enclosure experiments were exposed to higher irradiances (i. e., 30 %– 100 %) than those in the <b>growth</b> <b>chambers.</b> Our results show that (i) low temperatures led to an increased hemicellulose content, in parallel with sugar accumulation; (ii) low temperatures produced negligible changes in in vitro dry matter digestibility while leading to a higher in vitro rumen gas production, especially in the higher sugar-accumulating cultivar; (iii) transferring plants from cool to warm conditions led to a sharp decrease in in vitro rumen gas production in both cultivars; and (iv) light intensity (in contrast to temperature) appeared to have a lower impact on forage quality...|$|R
