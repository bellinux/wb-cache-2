25|$|Military cooperation– Past {{examples}} of international cooperation exist. One {{example is the}} security cooperation between the United States and the former Soviet Union {{after the end of}} the Cold War, which astonished international society. Arms control and disarmament agreements, including the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (see START <b>I,</b> <b>START</b> II, START III, and New START) and the establishment of NATO’s Partnership for Peace, the Russia NATO Council, and the G8 Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, constitute concrete initiatives of arms control and de-nuclearization. The US–Russian cooperation was further strengthened by anti-terrorism agreements enacted in the wake of 9/11.|$|E
500|$|... "A {{month before}} <b>I</b> <b>start</b> shooting, I sit with my director, try to {{understand}} how he has visualised the character {{on the screen and}} take notes. Then <b>I</b> <b>start</b> working on the most basic thing— the look. It's very important that the physical appearance of the character gets decided because if I look the character, it makes it all the more believable. Once that is achieved, I go into the finer nuances of what the girl is like, her background. And then from there [...] I have to get the accent right".|$|E

The coach whom I played under said I was fast and tall, and because of these qualities he saw in me, he {{converted}} me to a striker... <b>I</b> <b>started</b> playing in England when I was just about seven years old; and as I was growing up, <b>I</b> <b>started</b> from the lower divisions." [...] Sodje explains his early career.|$|R

500|$|Overall, One Hot Minute lyrically {{confronted the}} dark, melancholy and remorseful {{feelings}} Kiedis kept to himself. Many {{of the songs}} were written {{at a time when}} he was hiding his resumed addiction. [...] "Warped" [...] directly faced Kiedis's distraught moods as a hysterical cry for help: [...] "My tendency for dependency is offending me/It's upending me/I'm pretending to be strong and free from my dependency/It's warping me." [...] He also felt disappointed that [...] "no one had suspected that I'd slipped from my more than five years of sobriety." [...] The track itself was composed of heavy guitar riffs and echoing vocals which attempted to convey a distressed state. [...] "Aeroplane", the album's third single, was more upbeat than many of the album's songs; but it still contained various references to Kiedis's personal issues: [...] "Looking into my own eyes/I can't find the love I want/Someone better slap me before <b>I</b> <b>start</b> to rust/before <b>I</b> <b>start</b> to decompose." [...] The song also featured Flea's daughter Clara and her kindergarten class singing backing vocals on the last verse.|$|E
500|$|In 1912, Moreno {{attended}} one of Sigmund Freud's lectures. [...] In his autobiography, {{he recalled}} the experience: [...] "As the students filed out, he singled me out from the crowd and asked me what I was doing. I responded, 'Well, Dr. Freud, <b>I</b> <b>start</b> where you leave off. You meet people in the artificial setting of your office. I meet them {{on the street and}} in their homes, in their natural surroundings. You analyze their dreams. I give them the courage to dream again. You analyze and tear them apart. I let them act out their conflicting roles and help them to put the parts back together again.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Everett True said in 1989, [...] "Nirvana songs {{treat the}} banal and {{pedestrian}} {{with a unique}} slant". Cobain {{came up with the}} basic components of each song (usually writing them on an acoustic guitar), as well as the singing style and the lyrics. He emphasized that Novoselic and Grohl [...] "have a big part in deciding on how long a song should be and how many parts it should have. So I don't like to be considered the sole songwriter". When asked which part of the songs he would write first, Cobain responded, [...] "I don’t know. I really don't know. I guess <b>I</b> <b>start</b> with the verse and then go into the chorus".|$|E
50|$|About {{five years}} ago, I {{tried to make}} my life as {{complicated}} as possible. So <b>I</b> <b>started</b> this restaurant, and <b>I</b> <b>started</b> this Little Idiot illustrators’ collective, and <b>I</b> <b>started</b> a bottled beverage company, and I bought this piece of property upstate. And suddenly I had this very complicated life, and I realized that all the complications that filled my life weren’t making me happy. So I spent the last year basically {{trying to get rid}} of everything.|$|R

500|$|Dylan {{begins this}} track with a spoken intro where he {{describes}} the origins of folk songs in a satirical vein: [...] "most of the songs that are written uptown in Tin Pan Alley, that's {{where most of the}} folk songs come from nowadays". What follows has been characterized as an absurd, improvised blues which Dylan, in the sleeve notes, describes as [...] "a really off-the-cuff-song. <b>I</b> <b>start</b> with an idea and then I feel what follows. Best way I can describe this one is that it's sort of like walking by a side street. You gaze in and walk on." [...] Harvey points out that Dylan subsequently elaborated this style of self-deprecatory, absurdist humor into more complex songs, such as [...] "I Shall Be Free No.10" [...] (1964).|$|E
500|$|Just after {{becoming}} {{a part of}} the George Washington basketball program, Watanabe supposedly lacked panache, with teammate Kevin Larsen commenting, [...] "We told him to find a new celebration because the one he had wasn't cutting it. He was, like, jumping in the air making a weird face. So we tried to help him find a new one." [...] Watanabe sometimes mimicks Carmelo Anthony, using the [...] "three to the dome" [...] celebration after making three-pointers. He fit in with the Colonials as a key bench player and an instrumental element of their rotation as a freshman. Watanabe is often awarded playing time in late-game situations. Head coach Mike Lonergan said, [...] "With Yuta, we have scoring off the bench. If <b>I</b> <b>start</b> Yuta, we have no scoring off the bench at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{returned}} to Canned Applause in October for rehearsals, and completed most of OK Computer in further sessions at St. Catherine's Court. By Christmas, they had narrowed the track listing to 14 songs. The string parts were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London in January 1997. The album was mastered {{at the same}} location, and mixed {{over the next two}} months at various studios around the city. Godrich preferred a quick and [...] "hands-off" [...] approach to mixing, and said: [...] "I feel like I get too into it. <b>I</b> <b>start</b> fiddling with things and I fuck it up... I generally take about half a day to do a mix. If it's any longer than that, you lose it. The hardest thing is trying to stay fresh, to stay objective." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{successful}} summer {{followed for}} the Argentine. In July, del Potro {{and his team}} decided to remain in Europe to test his fitness. [...] "We decided to play on clay courts for my back because if <b>I</b> <b>start</b> to play again on hard courts, maybe I will injure it again", he recalled. Del Potro won his first career ATP tour title at the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, defeating Gasquet in straight sets in the final. A week later, del Potro reached his second career ATP Tour final at the Austrian Open in Kitzbühel, where he beat local hope and sixth seed Melzer {{in less than an}} hour, to claim his second title in two weeks. Having competed in just two clay tournaments all of the 2007 season, he never thought he would win his first two titles on clay courts.|$|E
500|$|... "Listen" [...] is a soul-R ballad, {{which is}} written in the key of B major, and set in common time at a {{moderately}} slow groove of 62 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocals range from the note of F3 to G5. The song's music takes its instrumentation from the bass, celli, drums, guitars, keyboards, percussion, violas, and violins. According to Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe, its lyrics make reference to tenacity, love, and the refusal to defer dreams; Beyoncé, as the female protagonist, sings, [...] "demanding her moment in the sun". Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine wrote that Beyoncé shimmers [...] "with evocative emotion", rising to new heights alongside [...] "a golden melody with spellbinding, rafter-raising production". The lyrics are written in the traditional verse-chorus form. The song starts with the lines: [...] "Listen to the song here in my heart, a melody <b>I</b> <b>start</b> but can't complete". A bridge follows after repeating the pattern and ends in another chorus.|$|E
500|$|In addition, Firth watched archive {{footage of}} the King speaking. In an {{interview}} with Allan Tyrer published by the British Stammering Association, Swain said: [...] " [...] was very interesting while {{we were working on}} the film just to think tonally how far we could go and should go with the strength of George's stammer. I think a less courageous director than Tom [...] – and indeed a less courageous actor than Colin [...] – might have felt the need to slightly sanitise the degree and authenticity of that stammer, and I'm really really pleased that neither of them did." [...] In May 2011 Firth said he was finding traces of the stammer difficult to eliminate: [...] "You can probably hear even from this interview, there are moments when it’s quite infectious," [...] he said. [...] "You find yourself doing it and if <b>I</b> <b>start</b> thinking about it the worse it gets. If nothing else it’s an insight into what it feels like." ...|$|E

500|$|DeHavilland {{was raised}} in the Episcopal Church and has {{remained}} an Episcopalian throughout her life. After moving to France, she {{became one of the first}} women lectors at the American Cathedral in Paris, where she was on the regular rota for Scripture readings. As recently as 2012, she was doing readings on major feast days, including Christmas and Easter. [...] "It's a task I love", she once said. In describing her preparation for her readings, she once observed, [...] "You have to convey the deep meaning, you see, and it has to start with your own faith. But first I always pray. I pray before <b>I</b> <b>start</b> to prepare, as well. In fact, I would always say a prayer before shooting a scene, so this is not so different, in a way." [...] DeHavilland prefers to use the Revised English Bible for its poetic style. She raised her son Benjamin in the Episcopal Church and her daughter Gisèle in the Roman Catholic Church, the faith of each child's father.|$|E
500|$|Lopez later {{confirmed}} {{in an interview}} On Air with Ryan Seacrest, that the completed music video would premiere jointly on season ten of American Idol and on Vevo on March 3,2011. Fans could vote between three alternative endings through Idols official website. Lopez said the idea behind giving fans the choice was {{to give them a}} chance to see what she experienced. [...] "You get to do what I do,... Like, I go in there with my videos and <b>I</b> <b>start</b> editing and picking all the shots I like and the things that I like and what I feel the best kind of feeling for the record is. You guys get to do that. We picked two different ones and we weren't sure." [...] The alternative endings included three varying scenes: in the first, the video ends with a close-up of Lopez's face in the silver lace catsuit; the second ends with a shot of dancers defying gravity on the walls and ceiling, while the final ending ends with a shot of Lopez on the dance floor in her harem pants. The first ending was the one used in the final video.|$|E
500|$|Nageswara Rao {{played the}} role of a 90-year-old man. His {{character}} enters the film just before the interval and remains until {{the very end of the}} film. All the members of the principal cast except Nageswara Rao played dual roles in the film. Nagarjuna said in an interview that he would be seen in the 1920s, 1980s and 2013 and would play a zamindar in 1920. Saran revealed that every character in the film would have a specific aspect; Nagarjuna's character loves cars. Regarding her role, Saran said that she would be seen as a poor but content farmer in the flashback sequences and a doctor in the present day. She added [...] "My character goes back to 1930s and comes back in the present era. I can't tell how it happens though. It's a fun character and you will find me stammering a lot. Suddenly, I'm talking normally and suddenly <b>I</b> <b>start</b> stammering, that's how you understand my character." [...] She added that apart from Nagarjuna, she has more scenes with Nageswara Rao and only a couple of scenes with Chaitanya in the film.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding {{his method}} of playwriting, Eliot explained, [...] "If I {{set out to}} write a play, <b>I</b> <b>start</b> {{by an act of}} choice. I settle upon a {{particular}} emotional situation, out of which characters and a plot will emerge. And then lines of poetry may come into being: not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind." ...|$|E
