25|$|In {{recent years}} {{attempts}} have been made to run shuttles between the Port of Melbourne and inland ports. Between 2003 and 2006 CRT Group operated a shuttle to their terminal at Altona, 22 kilometers from the docks. In 2004/05, the service transported 13,000 TEU, this being 42 per cent capacity for import and 58 per cent for export containers. The service ceased due to high access fees charged by track operator ARTC, and delays by interstate freight trains sharing the same track making the reliable operation of two trips per day impossible. The service restarted in 2005, but failed for the same reasons. A second port shuttle has operated to the Austrack terminal at Somerton during various periods since 1998, with difficulties faced including inefficient track layouts, <b>high</b> <b>rail</b> transfer charges at the port, and inconvenient timetables dictated by long distance freight services.|$|E
25|$|After World War 1 the {{independent}} Scottish companies were merged into the London Midland and Scottish and London and North Eastern companies. A Scottish {{company had been}} considered, but rejected as being probably not financially viable. Since the 1920s and 30s saw a decline in passenger and freight business, this was probably a correct judgement. At this time some lesser-used lines were closed to passenger traffic. After World War 2 the railways were nationalised. Very quickly the Scottish Region moved into a position where revenue was not covering operating expenses and after 1951 closures resumed. The pace of such closures accelerated after the Beeching Report of 1963 {{though some of the}} recommended closures did not take place after Ministers of Transport refused consent on grounds of hardship, a concept which was open to wide interpretation. Freight services were also withdrawn from the majority of stations and concentrated on larger depots and private sidings. At the same time steam traction was replaced by diesel, with most of the Glasgow suburban and commuter network being electrified, in addition to both of the main lines to England. This allowed acceleration of Anglo-Scottish services, with the Edinburgh-London service down from 7–8 hours in the 1950s to 4–5 hours today. However the reduction in the cost of air travel and <b>high</b> <b>rail</b> fares rising above inflation has seen the market share of rail in the Edinburgh/Glasgow to London route down considerably in recent years, as even with the time taken to travel to airports and check in, rail is unable to compete on journey time (unlike on routes such as London to Manchester).|$|E

40|$|In the past, {{the studies}} in the U. S. on <b>high</b> speed <b>rail</b> have been on {{economic}} impact. Recently, {{there are a few}} studies on the multimodal connectivity at <b>high</b> speed <b>rail</b> stations. <b>High</b> speed <b>rail</b> stations are viewed as hubs that are connected by different modes of public transportation by which passengers are transported to their destinations. How and in which way these different modes are connected to <b>high</b> speed <b>rail</b> stations influence the ridership of <b>high</b> speed <b>rail</b> stations. As the development of <b>high</b> speed <b>rail</b> system in the U. S. has come to the stage for actual design and construction, providing guidelines on multimodal connectivity at <b>high</b> speed <b>rail</b> stations become highly needed. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the multimodal connectivity of <b>high</b> speed <b>rail</b> stations. In this study, the multimodal connectivity is measured by the number of modes connected to <b>high</b> speed <b>rail</b> stations, the number of transportation facilities installed at HSR stations, the transfer time from the connecting modes to HSR stations, and the public transportation arrival time intervals. To achieve the objectives, data for different number of <b>high</b> speed <b>rail</b> stations in France, Spain, Japan and China were collected. With the data collected, the characteristics of the <b>high</b> speed <b>rail</b> stations in terms of connecting with other modes are identified. The relationship between ridership and the characteristics of multimodal connectivity of <b>high</b> speed <b>rail</b> stations were identified through developing regression models. It was observed from the analysis that the multimodal connectivity at <b>high</b> speed <b>rail</b> stations in different countries present different profiles. For example, the <b>high</b> speed <b>rail</b> stations in China are connected with more bus lines than other countries. The bus lines connected to HSR stations in other countries are similar. Relatively, there are more bus stops/terminals provided in France. The transfer times in Japan and China are significantly longer than those in France and Spain. The average bus arrival interval in France is longest, more than double than that in China. All the connectivity variables considered in this study influence the ridership in these four countries in different ways. Bus, subway, and regional railroad service influences ridership significantly. The number of bus services influences the ridership in three countries except France. The more bus services connected to <b>high</b> speed <b>rail</b> stations, the <b>higher</b> ridership for <b>high</b> speed <b>rail</b> is shown in these stations. Subway, light rail, traditional rail are modes of transportation with high capacity. Their connection to <b>high</b> speed <b>rail</b> station always implies high ridership for <b>high</b> speed <b>rail.</b> The number of facilities of connecting modes of transportation at HSR stations is also shown significant impacts on <b>high</b> speed <b>rail</b> ridership. For instance, the more bus and subway stops, and the more bicycle parking and taxi stands, the higher HSR ridership. Transfer time is identified to be significant influencing factor to HSR ridership: commuter rail and bicycle transfer time in France, and taxi transfer time for China. This study discusses the implications of these findings for the HSR stations proposed for California and Nevada. Pedestrian access is also discussed and recommended. Additional issues regarding transfer times in California 2 ̆ 7 s metropolitan areas are addressed...|$|R

6000|$|This {{conversation}} occurred {{the night}} before I went back to town. I settled on the morrow to take a late train, so that I had still my morning to spend at Folkestone, where during {{the greater part of}} it I was out with my mother. Every one in the place was as usual out with some one else, and even had I been free to go and take leave of her I should have been sure that Flora Saunt would not be at home. Just where she was I presently discovered: she was {{at the far end of}} the cliff, the point at which it overhangs the pretty view of Sandgate and Hythe. Her back however was turned to this attraction; it rested with the aid of her elbows, thrust slightly behind her so that her scanty little shoulders were raised toward her ears, on the <b>high</b> <b>rail</b> that inclosed the down. Two gentlemen stood before her whose faces we couldn't see but who even as observed from the rear were visibly absorbed in the charming figure-piece submitted to them. I was freshly struck with the fact that this meagre and defective little person, with the cock of her hat and the flutter of her crape, with her eternal idleness, her eternal happiness, her absence of moods and mysteries and the pretty presentation of her feet, which especially now in the supported slope of her posture occupied with their imperceptibility so much of the foreground--I was reminded anew, I say, how our young lady dazzled by some art that the enumeration of her merits didn't explain and that the mention of her lapses didn't affect. Where she was amiss nothing counted, and where she was right everything did. I say she was wanting in mystery, but that after all was her secret. This happened to be my first chance of introducing her to my mother, who had not much left in life but the quiet look from under the hood of her chair at the things which, when she should have quitted those she loved, she could still trust to make the world good for them. I wondered an instant how much she might be moved to trust Flora Saunt, and then while the chair stood still and she waited I went over and asked the girl to come and speak to her. In this way I saw that if one of Flora's attendants was the inevitable young Hammond Synge, master of ceremonies of her regular court, always offering the use of a telescope and accepting that of a cigar, the other was a personage I had not yet encountered, a small pale youth in showy knickerbockers, whose eyebrows and nose and the glued points of whose little moustache were extraordinarily uplifted and sustained. I remember taking him at first for a foreigner and for something of a pretender: I scarcely know why, unless because of the motive I felt in the stare he fixed on me when I asked Miss Saunt to come away. He struck me a little as a young man practising the social art of [...] "impertinence"; but it didn't matter, for Flora came away with alacrity, bringing all her prettiness and pleasure and gliding over the grass in that rustle of delicate mourning which made the endless variety of her garments, as a painter could take heed, strike one always as the same obscure elegance. She seated herself on the floor of my mother's chair, a little too much on her right instep as I afterwards gathered, caressing her stiff hand, smiling up into her cold face, commending and approving her without a reserve and without a doubt. She told her immediately, as if it were something for her to hold on by, that she was soon to sit to me for a [...] "likeness," [...] and these words gave me a chance to inquire if it would be the fate of the picture, should I finish it, to be presented to the young man in the knickerbockers. Her lips, at this, parted in a stare; her eyes darkened to the purple of one of the shadow-patches on the sea. She showed for the passing instant the face of some splendid tragic mask, and I remembered for the inconsequence of it what Mrs. Meldrum had said about her sight. I had derived from this lady a worrying impulse to catechise her, but that didn't seem exactly kind; so I substituted another question, inquired who the pretty young man in knickerbockers might happen to be.|$|E
