50|$|This was {{followed}} by the DeltaScan 50FS, the Delta 100, the Delta 2000 series of products and the HPS 1440. The DeltaScan FS reduced scan time to 18 seconds. A later modification to both units allowed the speed of the units to be reduced to 1/4 of normal speed which was used for <b>detailed</b> <b>head</b> scanning. This also increased the scan time but gave the added benefit of increased resolution for cases that warranted it. The Delta 100 scanner, introduced in 1978, was an inexpensive dedicated head scanner priced to get around the certificate of need restrictions in place at the time. The Delta 2000 series, introduced in 1977, included Delta 2005, Delta 2010, Delta 2020, Delta 2060 and Delta 2060 Quantum. These scanners could scan the body in 2-5 seconds, thereby eliminating motion artifacts due to breathing. The HPS 1440 scanner was introduced in 1985 as an ultra high resolution CT scanner. These scanners were of the fourth generation design, in which there was a stationary ring of detectors and the x-ray tube rotating inside the detector ring. One of the 2020 systems was operate at Brigham and Women's Hospital attempting cardiac gated imaging.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{present report}} {{provides}} a <b>detailed</b> <b>head</b> to head {{comparative study of}} migraine pain location at onset and during established headache between children and adults belonging to the same ethnic group. Migraine pain location in 200 children and adolescents had already been reported (Chakravarty et al. in Cephalalgia 27 : 1109 – 1114, 2007). The present report includes data collected simulta-neously and {{in a similar fashion}} from 800 adult migraineurs. Significant differences have been noted in migraine pain location. Unilateral onset pain is common in adults, side locked and vertex onset pain unusual in children, holocra-nial onset pain much common in children and cervico-occipital onset pain much less common in children. There have been differences in evolution of migraine pain as well. During established headache unilateral pain was recorded in only a small proportion of children (10. 5 %) whereas it was noted in many adults ’ subjects (40. 5 %).

40|$|The {{advancement}} of MRI as a radiological instrument {{has been associated}} with a constant drive towards higher magnetic field strengths resulting in higher operational frequencies. More powerful magnets bring the promise of enhanced signal to noise ratio, exquisite resolution, and reduced scan times. At the same time however, MRI at higher frequencies adds significant engineering complexities to the MRI experiment, most notably in designing safe, versatile, and high-performance radio frequency (RF) coils. In this work, computational and theoretical electromagnetic analysis of several RF coils used in MRI are presented at Larmor frequencies that range between 64 and 470 MHz representing clinical imaging at 1. 5 : 11 Tesla. The electromagnetic interac-tions with phantoms and anatomically <b>detailed</b> <b>head</b> models, including a developed high-resolution human head mesh, are studied at different field strengths.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the non-conducting {{substrate}} of a subdural grid on the scalp electric potential distribution is studied through simulations. Using a <b>detailed</b> <b>head</b> model and the finite element method we show that the governing physics equations predict an important attenuation in the scalp potential for generators located under the grid, and an amplification for generators located under holes in the skull filled with conductive media. These effects are spatially localized and do not cancel each other. A 4 × 8 cm grid can produce attenuations of 2 to 3 times, and an 8 × 8 cm grid attenuation of up to 8 times. As a consequence, {{when there is no}} subdural grid, generators of 4 to 8 cm 2 produce scalp potentials of the same maximum amplitude as generators of 10 to 20 cm 2 under the center of a subdural grid. This means that the minimum cortical extents necessary to produce visible scalp activity determined from simultaneous scalp and subdural recordings can be overestimations...|$|E

40|$|Patient-specific {{radiofrequency}} shimming in high-field MRI {{strengthens the}} need for online, patient-specific specific absorption rate (SAR) monitoring. Numerical simulation is currently most effective for this purpose but may require a patient-specific dielectric model. To investigate whether a generic model may be combined with a safety factor to account for variation within the population, generic SAR behavior is studied for 7 T MRI of the head. For six <b>detailed</b> <b>head</b> models, radiofrequency fields were simulated for an eight-channel parallel transmit array. SAR behavior is studied through comparison of the eigenvalues/eigenvectors of the local Q-matrices. Furthermore, numerical radiofrequency shimming experiments without and with SAR constraints were performed where SAR during optimization was evaluated on a generic model. In both cases, the ability of different generic models to predict actual SAR levels was evaluated. The largest eigenvalue distribution is comparable between models. Radiofrequency shimming without constraints improves the vertical bar B- 1 (+) vertical bar homogeneity while the SAR increases substantially. Imposing constraints on SAR during optimization, estimating SAR on a generic model, was effective. A safety factor of 1. 4 {{was found to be}} sufficient. Generic SAR behavior makes a generic head model a practical alternative to patient-specific models and allows effective vertical bar B- 1 (+) vertical bar shimming with SAR constraints.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 The recent {{reductions}} to {{the international}} dose limit recommendations for {{the lens of the}} eye have renewed interest in radiation protection strategies in interventional fluoroscopy, where eye-lens radiation exposure occurs frequently. Radiationshielding eyewear can significantly reduce lens dose in these scenarios, but accurate protection factors are elusive because they depend on a variety of factors. This work aims to investigate variables that affect eye shield performance in fluoroscopy rooms, test several shield designs, and rate the shield designs based on shielding performance. Eight separate shields were modeled in MCNP 5 using <b>detailed</b> <b>head</b> and eye geometry, and the shields were evaluated at eight individual source positions. Results showed that shields of different thicknesses and shapes can provide similar protection to the operator. A total protection factor of about 5 is the most protection a 0. 10 mm lead equivalent material can reasonably provide, and small shields constructed of this material can provide protection factors of about 3. Shield performance can vary greatly depending on the irradiation angle, and this could cause an overestimation of the dose reduction provided by the shield if vulnerable angles are exploited. With increasing evidence of cataract risk at low lens doses, fluoroscopy operators need radiation protection equipment that can provide well characterized protection, and radiation-shielding eyewear can provide excellent dose reduction if they are designed well and used correctly...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the final}} report of a three-year, Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). A Deformable Human Body Model (DHBM) capable of {{simulating}} {{a wide variety of}} deformation interactions between man and his environment has been developed. The model was intended to have applications in automobile safety analysis, soldier survivability studies and assistive technology development for the disabled. To date, we have demonstrated the utility of the DHBM in automobile safety analysis and are currently engaged in discussions with the U. S. military involving two additional applications. More specifically, the DHBM has been incorporated into a Virtual Safety Lab (VSL) for automobile design under contract to General Motors Corporation. Furthermore, we have won $ 1. 8 M in funding from the U. S. Army Medical Research and Material Command for development of a noninvasive intracranial pressure measurement system. The proposed research makes use of the <b>detailed</b> <b>head</b> model that is a component of the DHBM; the project duration is three years. In addition, we have been contacted by the Air Force Armstrong Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory concerning possible use of the DHBM in analyzing the loads and injury potential to pilots upon ejection from military aircraft.

40|$|In Sweden {{the most}} common traffic group {{that needs to be}} hospitalized due to injury is cyclists where head {{injuries}} are {{the most common}} severe injuries. According to current standards, the performance of a helmet is only tested against radial impact which is not commonly seen in real accidents. Some studies about helmet design have been published but those helmets have been tested for only a few loading conditions. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to use finite element models to evaluate the effect of the helmet’s design on the head in some more loading conditions. A <b>detailed</b> <b>head</b> model was used to evaluate three different helmet designs as well as non-helmet situations. The first helmet (Baseline Helmet) was an ordinary helmet available on the market. The two other helmet designs were a modification of the Baseline helmet with either a lower density of the EPS liner (Helmet 1) or a sliding layer between the scalp and the EPS liner (Helmet 2). Four different impact locations combined with four different impact directions were tested. The study showed that using a helmet can reduce the peak linear acceleration (85 %), peak angular acceleration (87 %), peak angular velocity (77 %) and peak strain in the brain tissue (77 %). The reduction of the strain level was dependent on the loading conditions. Moreover, in thirteen of the sixteen loading conditions Helmet 2 gave lowest peak strain. The alteration of the helmet design showed that more can be done to improve the protective effect of the helmet. This study highlighted the need of a modification of current helmet standard test which can lead to helmets with even better protective properties as well as some challenges in implementing new test standards.
