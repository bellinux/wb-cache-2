5000|$|Louis Henry Sullivan {{headed the}} {{so-called}} Chicago school of architecture, which was distinct by its development of functional design along with modern materials. Sullivan's follower Frank Lloyd Wright absorbed from his 'lieber Master' (dear master) the German romantic tradition of organic architecture. He {{developed a new}} and original approach to residential design before World War I, which {{became known as the}} [...] "prairie style." [...] It combined open planning principles with horizontal emphasis, asymmetrical <b>facade</b> <b>elevations,</b> and broad, sheltering roofs. Robie House in Chicago (1909) and the Guggenheim Museum in New York City (1946-59) are two of his seminal works.|$|R
50|$|The {{station is}} being {{constructed}} as an elevated station within the Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus {{in front of}} the main <b>facade.</b> <b>Elevation</b> of the platforms will be about 15 m from the ground level and the total length of the platforms will be 140 m. The station will be able to handle about 23,000 passengers an hour.|$|E
50|$|The {{house is}} a large antebellum house and remnant of a sea island cotton plantation. James Hopkinson was a {{grandson}} of Francis Hopkinson, a signer of the Declaration of Independence from New Jersey and designer of the American flag. The house was occupied during the Civil War by the Third New Hampshire Regiment. The two-and-one-half story, rectangular plan house has a side-gable roof and a raised, brick basement in Flemish bond. The building is clad in weatherboard other than the pedimented gable ends which uses flushboard siding. There are two massive, interior, brick chimneys that have stuccoed necking and rat-tooth bands. A full-width, five-bay, hipped roof porch extends across the <b>façade</b> <b>elevation</b> supported by plain columns. The interior has marble mantels and door and window surrounds with bull’s-eye cornerblocks. The house {{was added to the}} National Register on November 28, 1986.|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{buildings}} that {{are attributed to}} Holt are placed in this category because they possess stylistic similarities with other {{buildings that}} are documented to have been built by J.W. Holt. A prime example of a Holt-documented house is Dr. Robert D. Baskerville’s Eureka in Mecklenburg County, Virginia. An 1857 contract between Baskerville and Holt specified the design to be {{a modified version of}} a plate in Ranlett’s Architect. The building was to be completed by 15 August 1858 at a cost of $4,885.00. While the floor plan of the villa described by Ranlett was used, the <b>façade</b> <b>elevation</b> was modified to suit the needs of the client. Mantels, windows, and other architectural details for Eureka did not follow Ranlett’s specifications, but rather conformed in character to what Holt had included in previous buildings. According to Catherine Bishir, Eureka was “perhaps Holt's grandest private project, bearing the stamp of his standardized detail but in its dramatic towered form and atypical plan reflecting the productive cooperation of builder and adventuresome client.” Franklin County, North Carolina’s Vine Hill is also documented to have been built by Jacob W. Holt by a 5 September 1856 contract. The front entryway and Palladian windows of Eureka and Vine Hill, both documented Holt houses, are identical to that found at Annefield.|$|E
50|$|Pella Palace (Пеллинский дворец) was {{a summer}} {{residence}} built {{during the reign}} of Catherine II of Russia for her grandson, future emperor Alexander. It was situated on the left bank of the Neva River, 30 km east of Saint Petersburg, where the town of Otradnoye now stands. If completed, it would have been Russia's largest imperial palace. Pella, partially built in 1785-1789, has been razed to the ground by Catherine's son, Paul of Russia. Not only the buildings disappeared, but very few images of it survived the Battle of the Palaces: existing knowledge of Pella relies on a few <b>facade</b> <b>elevations</b> and watercolors by Giacomo Quarenghi and an elaborate drawing on Catherine's fan, also based on Quarenghi's drafts.|$|R

50|$|The {{commission}} was {{granted to the}} architect Giulio Parigi, who between 1622 and 1625, introduced a more ornate Baroque style, and the later version of Baroque, Rococo. This was achieved with an expanded floor plan, lengthening the <b>facades</b> and <b>elevations.</b> These longer <b>facades</b> were in the late 18th century deprived of their Baroque ornament to create the chaste austere neoclassical architecture seen at the villa today.|$|R
50|$|A porch {{spans the}} front <b>facade</b> (south <b>elevation)</b> and wraps around {{about one-third of}} the elevation. It is raised with a {{concrete}} floor and steps. The steps are flanked by short sandstone wing walls that are capped with concrete and decorated with concrete horse heads. Slightly tapered sandstone columns with concrete capitals support the porch roof, whose ceiling is made of tongue-in-groove wood painted white. Four-inch diameter metal pipes connecting the columns, serve as the porch rail.|$|R

50|$|A {{skillful}} {{example of}} Beaux-Arts classicism, the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse {{is indicative of}} the federal government's goal of expressing democratic ideals through classically derived architecture featuring grand scale, symmetry, and refined details. The six-story building encompasses an entire city block and is constructed of steel and concrete clad in rich local materials—Texas Pink granite and Texas Cream limestone. The building is polygonal in plan, centered on a central light court. Its <b>facade</b> (south <b>elevation)</b> emphasizes a centrally recessed porch behind a screen of six monumental Ionic columns, rising to support an entablature that continues all around the building.|$|R
50|$|Monroe Wilson House is a {{historic}} home located at Ridgeway, Fairfield County, South Carolina. It was built about 1890, and is a two-story, rectangular, frame Victorian vernacular house. It features a porch that runs along the <b>façade</b> and southeast <b>elevation</b> with square posts and elaborate brackets. There is a small second story porch over the front entrance.|$|R
50|$|William Austin House is a {{historic}} home located at Trumansburg in Tompkins County, New York. It was built in 1870 and is a -story Second Empire-style brick structure. The house consists of a rectangular main block with an asymmetrically placed rear wing and a mansard roof. The front <b>facade</b> and west <b>elevation</b> are dominated by a handsome verandah.|$|R
50|$|All {{but one of}} {{the side}} bays has a stained-glass window. The front bay on either {{elevation}} has a window like the end bays on the <b>facade.</b> The rear <b>elevation</b> has nearly full-height projecting bays with gable roof, each containing a stained-glass window like the ones along the sides. There is also a small shed-roofed addition that serves as the Torah ark.|$|R
50|$|Four bays by three, the Rice Building sits on {{a raised}} stone {{foundation}} supporting golden Roman brick walls with quoined corners topped by a flat roof. A slightly lower three-by-three-bay wing extends from the north <b>facade.</b> The east <b>elevation</b> has a balustraded porch on the three northern bays serving {{what is now the}} main entrance; the original main entry on the opposite side has been bricked in.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is three stories in height and utilizes a steel-frame and reinforced-concrete structural system. Despite the additions of the annexes, the building presents a cohesive appearance because both additions {{were designed to}} be compatible with the original building. The foundation is clad in smooth-faced granite, and limestone ashlar covers the principal <b>facade</b> and side <b>elevations.</b> The rear elevation is clad in economical buff-colored brick.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} portal, which was classed as a {{national}} monument of France {{in its own right}} in 1884, the present cathedral was built from 1694 onwards in a plain style of Classical inspiration. The main <b>façade</b> and south <b>elevation</b> have a massive, almost austere, appearance. The north elevation however, which looks onto a small square in the historical centre of the town, does not lack charm, despite a certain rigidity.|$|R
50|$|Mecklenburg County Courthouse is a {{historic}} courthouse building located at Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. It was designed by noted architect Louis H. Asbury and built between 1925 and 1928. It is four-story, rectangular, Neoclassical building sheathed in limestone. The structure is a three-part composition with a decastyle Corinthian order portico on the front <b>facade.</b> The rear <b>elevation</b> has a tetrastyle portico sheltering the three-center bays and Corinthian pilasters.|$|R
5|$|The main <b>façade</b> (south <b>elevation)</b> of Literary Hall {{is divided}} into three bays, and its west and east {{elevations}} are divided into five bays. Each of the building's bays consists of a double-hung sash wooden window, with nine panes of glass within each sash. The windows are symmetrically placed within recessed brick panels that are defined at the first and second stories of the building with elementary brick ribs, or pseudo-pilasters, that form the outer surface of the building's exterior walls and provide separation of the three bays of the main façade and the five bays of the west and east elevations. The windows are framed by white wooden louvered window shutters. The building's brick is laid in an American bond pattern, with five courses of stretchers between every course of headers.|$|R
50|$|French {{influence}} {{is also found}} in developing the chancel, where initially the choir was to be put according to their custom. Specifically Leonese is the location of the cloister, with no organic tie to the temple, the exit in the floor plan of the towers of the main <b>facade,</b> displaying the <b>elevation</b> of the buttresses of the nave, and the discontinuity of the five naves at {{the front end of the}} main area of the temple, which were reduced to three.|$|R
50|$|Ormsby-Laughlin Textile Companies Mill is a {{historic}} textile mill located at Waterford in Saratoga County, New York. It was built in 1894 and is a -story, Romanesque Revival style, brick industrial building with a gable roof. It features a -story tower {{at the center of}} the front <b>facade.</b> The rear <b>elevation</b> features a 5-story elevator tower and a 100-foot-square brick smokestack attached to a 1-story wing. It is the only surviving factory associated with the major industrial community known as Dial City.|$|R
50|$|Queen Street Baptist Church is a {{historic}} African-American Baptist church located at Norfolk, Virginia. It was built in 1910 - 1911, and is a rectangular one-story brick church in the Late Gothic Revival style. The <b>façade</b> and side <b>elevations</b> have Gothic pointed arch windows and the church is topped by a spire that rests atop the roof at the façade. An educational annex was built in 1952, and expanded in 1957. The Queen Street Baptist Church congregation dates to 1884.|$|R
5|$|The plan of {{the house}} is unusual, partly because of its {{incorporation}} of the earlier building; it extends at right angles to the primary (southern) <b>façade.</b> The <b>elevations</b> are symmetrical, facing outwards, but the interior court is narrow, and projecting wings lie {{at either end of the}} eastern and western sides. Bramshill House is three storeys high on the southern main entrance side and two storeys high to the north and east. There are three vaulted cellars to the west. The house is built of red brick laid in English bond dressed with stone, with ashlar quoining at the corners of the wings. Stone dressings are featured on numerous large mullion windows. An open carved parapet surmounts the building. The roof consists of red tiles, and there are large gables on the west side. The chimney stacks are rectangular.|$|R
500|$|The 1849 {{church is}} a small, one-and-a-half-story, front-gable building. The main <b>façade</b> (northwestern <b>elevation)</b> has two main entrances, {{enclosed}} by white-painted wood, recessed panel doors, and capped by white-painted stone lintels with two stone corner blocks. The church's exterior is brickwork, laid in Flemish bond on the main façade and a five-course American bond on the northeastern, southeastern and southwestern elevations. Two blue-gray stained glass windows (installed in 1905) are symmetrically placed above the main entrances, each capped by stone lintels with two stone corner blocks. The main façade is crowned by a white painted entablature molding with two cornice returns, exemplifying Greek Revival architectural design. In {{the top of the}} gable, a square date stone engraved [...] "1849" [...] is embedded in the brickwork above a gooseneck light fixture. Although the church is now topped by a metal standing-seam roof, it was originally sheathed by wooden shakes.|$|R
5000|$|Built in 1835 for Absalom Thompson, this {{brick house}} was {{originally}} a Federal style, 1-1/2 story ell-shaped structure. The house {{was most likely}} built by Nathan Yaught, a master craftsman who built or re-modelled many houses in Maury County. Around 1860, the house was changed to a two-story dwelling with Greek Revival features. It has an early flat roof and a 3-bay symmetrical <b>facade</b> (south <b>elevation),</b> and is painted white. The earlier, first floor section {{of the house is}} laid in Flemish bond, and the second story, raised around 1860, is laid in American common bond. Four exterior brick chimneys are located in pairs on the east and west elevations of the main section of the house, and two brick chimneys are located on the ell: one is an original, interior chimney, and the other, a new exterior chimney {{at the north end of}} the ell.|$|R
50|$|Lomax African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church is a {{historic}} African Methodist Episcopal Zion church located at 2704 24th Rd. South in Arlington, Virginia.

25|$|Committed to the project, Layton {{set out on}} his voyage {{across the}} Atlantic and hired George Ashdown Audsley, a Liverpool {{architect}} to design the gallery building. A local Milwaukee firm led by Edward Townsend Mix worked jointly with the British architect {{to carry out the}} construction. Layton was specific in his vision of the gallery and asked of Audsley: “Can we not have a building one story over a basement, about 80x100 feet, in the center of our ground that will look well?” The resulting design was a single-story top-lit gallery that differed from other American gallery designs of the period. Authors John C. Eastberg and Eric Vogel observe in their book, Layton’s Legacy, that the gallery design was directly inspired by the art galleries of Great Britain and compare the Layton Art Gallery’s floor plan, <b>façade</b> and <b>elevations</b> with institutions such as the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, the Dulwich Picture Gallery of Greater London and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.|$|R
25|$|Many of the Romanesque cathedrals were modernised with Gothic elements. Thus, the Romanesque nave of Oporto Cathedral is {{supported}} by flying buttresses, {{one of the first}} built in Portugal (early 13th century). The apse of Lisbon Cathedral was totally remodelled {{in the first half of}} the 14th century, when it gained a Gothic ambulatory illuminated by a clerestory (high row of windows on the upper storey). The ambulatory has a series of radiant chapels illuminated with large windows, contrasting with the dark Romanesque nave of the cathedral. An important transitional building is Évora Cathedral, built during the 13th century; even though its floorplan, <b>façade</b> and <b>elevation</b> are inspired by Lisbon Cathedral, its forms (arches, windows, vaults) are already Gothic. Many Gothic churches maintained the fortress-like appearance of Romanesque times, like the already-mentioned Évora Cathedral, the Church of the Monastery of Leça do Balio (14th century) near Matosinhos, and even as late as the 15th-century, with the Main Church of Viana do Castelo.|$|R
