5|$|During the Armenian <b>Genocide,</b> <b>in</b> April–May 1915, the Turkish army attacked, burned, and {{destroyed}} {{much of the}} monastery. More of it was destroyed in the 1960s, although some sections are still extant.|$|E

5|$|The UN {{has also}} drawn {{criticism}} for perceived failures. In many cases, member states have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council resolutions. Disagreements in the Security Council about military action and intervention {{are seen as}} having failed to prevent the Bangladesh <b>genocide</b> <b>in</b> 1971, the Cambodian <b>genocide</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s, and the Rwandan <b>genocide</b> <b>in</b> 1994. Similarly, UN inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 or complete the peacekeeping operations in 1992–93 during the Somali Civil War. UN peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape, soliciting prostitutes, and sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Sudan and what is now South Sudan, Burundi, and Ivory Coast. Scientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the likely source of the 2010–13 Haiti cholera outbreak, which killed more than 8,000 Haitians following the 2010 Haiti earthquake.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} {{healthcare}} in Rwanda {{has historically been}} very low, both before and immediately after the 1994 <b>genocide.</b> <b>In</b> 1998, {{more than one in}} five children died before their fifth birthday, often from malaria.|$|E

5|$|In March 2014, Croatia alleged {{before the}} International Court of Justice (ICJ) that the {{massacre}} in Voćin {{was part of}} a larger campaign of genocide targeting the Croat population of Slavonia. In 2015, the ICJ ruled that Serb forces had not committed <b>genocide</b> <b>in</b> Croatia, and stated that the Croatian legal team had failed to prove that any mass killing had taken place in Voćin.|$|E
5|$|Olver {{has been}} {{critical}} of the United States lack of involvement regarding the <b>genocide</b> <b>in</b> Darfur. Olver was one of five members of Congress arrested April 28, 2006 after protesting the genocide outside the Sudanese Embassy. Olver was arrested again in front of the Sudanese Embassy during a protest in 2012 along with other members of Congress and actor George Clooney.|$|E
5|$|The working {{title was}} 24: Exile. The {{concept of the}} film started since the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which delayed the seventh season for a year thus leaving {{a gap in the}} series during 2008. Redemption was {{somewhat}} inspired by the Rwandan <b>Genocide</b> <b>in</b> 1994. The majority of Redemption was filmed on location outside Cape Town, South Africa since it was difficult to mimic an authentic African scenery in America.|$|E
50|$|Screamers is a 2006 {{documentary}} film directed by Carla Garapedian, conceived by Peter McAlevey and Garapedian and produced by McAlevey. The film explores why <b>genocides</b> have occurred <b>in</b> modern day history and features talks from Serj Tankian, lead vocalist of the American alternative metal band System of a Down, whose grandfather is an Armenian Genocide survivor, {{as well as}} from human-rights activist, journalist, and professor, Samantha Power, as well as various other people involved with <b>genocides</b> <b>in</b> Rwanda and Darfur. Screamers also examines <b>genocide</b> denial <b>in</b> current-day Turkey, and the neutral trend that the United States generally holds towards genocide.|$|R

5|$|While {{speaking}} on the 2017 presidential elections in France, Kagame {{said in an interview}} to Jeune Afrique a possible election of conservative candidate Alain Juppé will likely end all possible relations between France and Rwanda. Juppé was the French Foreign Affairs minister during the period of the Rwanda <b>genocide</b> <b>in</b> 1994.|$|E
5|$|After the South Carolina debate, Biden campaigned in California {{to begin}} May 2007 {{attending}} events in San Francisco. Later {{in the month}} after President George W. Bush enacted economic sanctions against Sudan to pressure the government to end the <b>genocide</b> <b>in</b> Darfur, Biden momentarily shifted focus from Iraq to the crisis in Darfur. He released a statement {{on the campaign trail}} that expressed his belief that Bush was right to enact the sanctions. However, Biden argued that it was not enough, calling for a No-Fly Zone over the region and a possible commitment of United States forces to the nation.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{identified}} two themes: morality and the UN effectiveness. Off characterized Dallaire and Arbour as morally correct and MacKenzie morally wrong. In Rwanda, Dallaire lobbied the UN to intervene {{to stop the}} <b>genocide.</b> <b>In</b> Yugoslavia, MacKenzie is accused of being an apologist for the Serbs. In an interview Off admitted that she would prefer MacKenzie to be her son's commander but would want Dallaire if her people were being attacked because one puts his soldiers before the mission and the other the mission before the soldiers.|$|E
5000|$|After Pope Francis {{has spoken}} that the Armenian {{genocide}} {{was one of}} the three major <b>genocides</b> <b>in</b> the 20th century, on 16 April 2015 Davutoğlu said that the Pope joined the [...] "evil front" [...] and the conspiracy against the Justice and Development Party.|$|R

Ramba felt an {{emotional}} connection with Sutherland during filming, and believes their friendship shows through onscreen. Isaach De Bankolé plays Ule Matobo, the Prime Minister of the nation, who is forced to evacuate the country during the coup. Among the antagonists in Sangala are General Benjamin Juma (Tony Todd), a former dictator and leader of the People's Freedom Army responsible for <b>genocide</b> <b>in</b> Sangala, and Iké Dubaku (Hakeem Kae-Kazim), one of Juma's lieutenants in the coup. Zolile Nokwe plays Youssou Dubaku, Iké's younger brother.|$|E
5|$|The <b>genocide</b> <b>in</b> Lithuania {{is seen by}} {{some historians}} {{as one of the}} {{earliest}} large-scale implementations of the Final Solution, leading some scholars to express an opinion that the Holocaust began in Lithuania in the summer of 1941. Other scholars say the Holocaust started in September 1939 with the onset of the Second World War, or even earlier, on Kristallnacht in 1938, or, according to the Jewish Virtual Library, when Hitler became Chancellor of Germany in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Hunter gatherers {{settled the}} {{territory}} in the stone and iron ages, followed later by Bantu peoples. The population coalesced first into clans and then into kingdoms. The Kingdom of Rwanda dominated from the mid-18th century, with the Tutsi kings conquering others militarily, centralising power and later enacting anti-Hutu policies. Germany colonised Rwanda in 1884 as part of German East Africa, followed by Belgium, which invaded in 1916 during the First World War. Both European nations ruled through the kings and perpetuated a pro-Tutsi policy. The Hutu population revolted in 1959. They massacred numerous Tutsi and ultimately established an independent, Hutu-dominated state in 1962. The Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front launched a civil war in 1990. Social tensions erupted in the 1994 <b>genocide,</b> <b>in</b> which Hutu extremists killed an estimated 500,000 to 1.3 million Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The RPF ended the genocide with a military victory.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to these duties, forensic anthropologists often assist {{in the investigation of}} war crimes and mass fatality investigations. Anthropologists have been tasked with helping to identify victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks as well as plane crashes such as the Arrow Air Flight 1285 disaster and the USAir Flight 427 disaster where the flesh had been vaporized or so badly mangled that normal identification was impossible. Anthropologists have also helped identify victims of <b>genocide</b> <b>in</b> countries around the world, often long after the actual event. War crimes anthropologists have helped investigate include the Rwandan Genocide and the Srebrenica Genocide. Organizations such as the Forensic Anthropology Society of Europe, the British Association for Forensic Anthropology, and the American Society of Forensic Anthropologists continue to provide guidelines for the improvement of forensic anthropology and the development of standards within the discipline.|$|E
5|$|Kagame {{was born}} to a Tutsi family in {{southern}} Rwanda. His mother was younger sister to King Ndahindurwa's wife. When he was two years old, the Rwandan Revolution ended centuries of Tutsi political dominance; his family fled to Uganda, where he {{spent the rest of}} his childhood. In the 1980s, Kagame fought in Yoweri Museveni's rebel army, becoming a senior Ugandan army officer after Museveni's military victories carried him to the Ugandan presidency. Kagame joined the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which invaded Rwanda in 1990; leader Fred Rwigyema died early in the war and Kagame took control. By 1993, the RPF controlled significant territory in Rwanda and a ceasefire was negotiated. The assassination of Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana was the starting point of the <b>genocide,</b> <b>in</b> which Hutu extremists killed {{a little more than a}} million Tutsi and moderate Hutu combined. Kagame resumed the civil war, and ended the genocide with a military victory.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the ICTY {{secretly}} indicted Arkan for {{war crimes}} carried out in Sanski Most in 1995, but not for those in Bijeljina. In January 2000, {{he was killed in}} a Belgrade hotel lobby by masked gunmen, and did not face trial. In 1999, Milošević was indicted for carrying out a genocidal campaign that included Bijeljina and other locations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, among other charges, but he died mid-trial in March 2006. In February 2000, Plavšić and Momčilo Krajišnik, the speaker of the National Assembly of Republika Srpska, were indicted for the same genocidal campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina, among other charges. On 2 October 2002, Plavšić pleaded guilty to persecuting the non-Serb populations in 37 municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including Bijeljina. This plea was entered under an agreement that involved the prosecution moving to dismiss the remaining charges. She was subsequently sentenced to 11 years imprisonment. On 27 September 2006, Krajišnik was found guilty on a five counts of crimes against humanity, including the same count as Plavšić regarding the persecution of non-Serb populations in municipalities including Bijeljina, but he was found not guilty of <b>genocide.</b> <b>In</b> 2009, he was handed a twenty-year prison sentence. After serving two-thirds of her sentence, Plavšić was released in October 2009. Krajišnik was released in August 2013, having served two-thirds of his sentence (including time spent in custody).|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} a number of civil wars and <b>{{genocide}}s</b> <b>in</b> Central Africa that are also close to East Africa, such as the Burundi genocide and the Rwandan genocide (1994). Some of the most notorious military dictators were Bokassa I of Central Africa (1921-1996) and Mobutu Sese Seko (1930-1997) of Zaire.|$|R
