5|$|Tago Mago is {{the third}} album by the German krautrock band Can, {{originally}} released as a double LP in 1971. It was the band's second studio album {{and the first to}} feature Damo Suzuki after the 1970 departure of previous vocalist Malcolm Mooney. Recorded in a rented castle near Cologne, the album features longer experimental tracks blending funk, avant-garde music, jazz, and electronic tape <b>editing</b> <b>techniques.</b>|$|E
5|$|Don't Look Now {{is renowned}} for its {{innovative}} editing style and its use of recurring motifs and themes and for a controversial sex scene that was explicit for its time. The film often employs flashbacks and flashforwards {{in keeping with the}} depiction of precognition, but some scenes are intercut or merged to alter the viewer's perception of what is really happening. It adopts an impressionist approach to its imagery, often presaging events with familiar objects, patterns and colours using associative <b>editing</b> <b>techniques.</b>|$|E
5|$|Film noirs {{tend to have}} unusually {{convoluted}} story lines, frequently involving flashbacks {{and other}} <b>editing</b> <b>techniques</b> that disrupt and sometimes obscure the narrative sequence. Framing the entire primary narrative as a flashback is also a standard device. Voiceover narration, sometimes used as a structuring device, {{came to be seen}} as a noir hallmark; while classic noir is generally associated with first-person narration (i.e., by the protagonist), Stephen Neale notes that third-person narration is common among noirs of the semidocumentary style. Neo-noirs as varied as The Element of Crime (surrealist), After Dark, My Sweet (retro), and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (meta) have employed the flashback/voiceover combination.|$|E

40|$|Writing is {{a process}} of {{exploring}} ideas to share the writersÂ’ ideas with the readers through written language. One of the difficulties faced by students when they write is no one checking the studentsÂ’ writing. Based on the consideration above, the researcher argues that peer editing might become a teaching technique which can be applied to solve this problem. So, this present study is intended to know the way the lecturer implements the peer <b>editing</b> <b>technique,</b> to identify the problems faced by the students when the peer <b>editing</b> <b>technique</b> is implemented, and to understand the way how the students solve their problems when the peer <b>editing</b> <b>technique</b> is implemented at English Department, University of Muhammadiyah Malang. For that purposes, descriptive research was adopted because the researcher assessed the nature of existing conditions. The instruments used were observation field notes and questionnaire checklist. This research was conducted at the English Department, University of Muhammadiyah Malang on the academic year 2013 - 2014. The participants of the present study consisted of two parties. First, it was twenty four (24) students of English writing class (VIH). They were taken out from the target population using purposive sampling procedure. Second, it was one writing lecturer who taught writing IV in H class. He was taken as the sample because he taught writing IV using peer <b>editing</b> <b>technique.</b> The result showed that the way the lecturer implements the peer <b>editing</b> <b>technique</b> in writing class in proper way which was in line with the explanation from Yang et. al (2006).

5|$|On {{one of her}} adventures, Riefenstahl met Luis Trenker, who was {{an actor}} from Der Berg des Schicksals. At a meeting {{arranged}} by her friend Gunther Rahn, she met Arnold Fanck, the director of Der Berg des Schicksals and a pioneer of the mountain film genre. Fanck {{was working on a}} film in Berlin. After Riefenstahl told him how much she admired his work, she also convinced him of her acting skill. She persuaded him to feature her in one of his movies. Riefenstahl later received a package from Fanck containing the script of the 1926 film Der Heilige Berg ("The Holy Mountain"). She made a series of films for Fanck, where she learned from him acting and film <b>editing</b> <b>techniques.</b> One of Fanck's films that brought Riefenstahl into the limelight was Die Weisse Hölle vom Piz Palü ("The White Hell of Piz Palü") of 1929, co-directed by G.

5|$|Wasting Light is {{the seventh}} studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters. It was {{released}} on April 12, 2011 on RCA Records, and is the first album to feature rhythm guitarist Pat Smear since The Colour and the Shape (1997), making the band a five piece with the album. Wishing to {{capture the essence of}} the group's earlier work and avoid the artificiality of digital recording, frontman Dave Grohl arranged for the band to record in his garage in Encino, California using only analog equipment. The sessions were supervised by producer Butch Vig, with whom Grohl had worked on Nirvana's Nevermind. Since the old equipment did not allow for many mistakes to be corrected in post-production, the band spent three weeks rehearsing the songs, and Vig had to relearn outdated <b>editing</b> <b>techniques.</b> The band went for a heavier and rawer sound to contrast with the musical experiments from their previous albums, and most of the lyrics were written as Grohl reflected upon his life and possible future. Guest musicians include Bob Mould, Krist Novoselic, Jessy Greene, Rami Jaffe and Fee Waybill.|$|E

25|$|In {{comparison}} to other genome <b>editing</b> <b>techniques</b> TALEN {{falls in the}} middle in terms of difficulty and cost. Unlike ZFNs, TALEN recognizes single nucleotides. It's far more straightforward to engineer interactions between TALEN DNA binding domains and their target nucleotides {{than it is to}} create interactions with ZNFs and their target nucleotide triplets. On the other hand, CRISPR relies on ribonucleotide complex formation instead of protein/DNA recognition. gRNAs can target nearly any sequence in the genome and they can be cheaply produced, thus making CRISPR more efficient and less expensive than both TALEN and ZFN. TALEN is ultimately 200 times more expensive than CRISPR and takes several months more to perform.|$|E
25|$|From {{the very}} beginning, {{the show was}} seen as having series potential. After Regan scored highly in the ratings, work began on the {{development}} of the series proper. Ian Kennedy Martin's idea was for the series to be mainly studio-based, with more dialogue and less action, but producer Ted Childs disagreed, and in consequence Ian Kennedy Martin parted company with the project. Childs produced it on film, not videotape, so making it possible to shoot it almost entirely on location using 16mm film (which gave it a startling degree of realism), and to use film <b>editing</b> <b>techniques,</b> enabling him to give the show a heavy bias toward action sequences.|$|E

25|$|When {{compared}} {{specifically to}} other scar-free genome <b>editing</b> <b>techniques</b> including the method published by Datsenko and Wanner, the no-SCAR method is less time-consuming when multiple mutations are desired. Two {{components of the}} method mediate this rapid mutation ability. First, the pCas9cr4 plasmid is retained in the cells after the first iteration thus preventing repetitive transfection of the plasmid into the cells. In instances where three genome modifications are desired, for example, {{this means that the}} no-SCAR method is able to mediate these mutations four days faster than the next fastest method. Second, the wild-type gene is never removed from the chromosome. This means that PCR screening is able to more quickly identify numerous mutants because essential wild-type genes can be targeted with ease.|$|E

40|$|THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PEER EDITING IN IMPROVING WRITING SKILLS AMONG THE SECOND SEMESTER STUDENTS OF WRITING CLASS OF ENGLISH EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OF STATE UNIVERSITY OF YOGYAKARTA IN THE ACADEMIC YEAR OF 2011 / 2012 By: Wahtini 05202241044 ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to find out whether there is {{a significant difference in the}} writing skill between the students who are taught using peer <b>editing</b> <b>technique</b> and those who are taught using teacher <b>editing</b> <b>technique.</b> The design of this study was a quasi-experimental study. The study was conducted in English Department of State University ofYogyakarta, Sleman. The population of the study was included all the second semester students of Writing Class of English Department of State University of Yogyakarta, Sleman, in the academic year of 2011 / 2012. Two classes were selected using the cluster random sampling technique from the population as the experimental and control groups, i. e. Class A and Class B. There were 20 students in Class A and 20 students in Class B. Class A waschosen as the experimental group while Class B was chosen as the control group. The experimental group was taught by using peer <b>editing</b> <b>technique</b> whereas the control group was taught by using teacher <b>editing</b> <b>technique.</b> The data were collected by administering a pre-test and a post-test. The data were analyzed using ANCOVA. The results of the data analysis are as follows. First, the increase of mean score of experimental group (1. 95) is higher than that of the control group (0. 15). Second, the standard deviation of post-test of experimental group (1. 67) is more homogeneous than the control group (1. 83). Third, the frequency of score of experimental group increases (5...|$|R

50|$|Cross-cutting is an <b>editing</b> <b>technique</b> {{most often}} used in films to {{establish}} action occurring at the same time, and usually in the same place.

500|$|Machinima has {{advantages}} and disadvantages when compared to other styles of filmmaking. Its relative simplicity over traditional frame-based animation limits control and range of expression. Its real-time nature favors speed, cost saving, and flexibility over the higher quality of pre-rendered computer animation. Virtual acting is less expensive, dangerous, and physically restricted than live action. Machinima can be filmed by relying on in-game artificial intelligence (AI) or by controlling characters and cameras through digital puppetry. [...] Scenes can be precisely scripted, and can be manipulated during post-production using video <b>editing</b> <b>techniques.</b> Editing, custom software, and creative cinematography may address technical limitations. Game companies have provided software for and have encouraged machinima, but the widespread use of digital assets from copyrighted games has resulted in complex, unresolved legal issues.|$|E
500|$|One of the <b>editing</b> <b>techniques</b> used in Citizen Kane {{was the use}} of montage to {{collapse}} time and space, using an episodic sequence on the same set while the characters changed costume and make-up between cuts so that the scene following each cut would look as if it took place in the same location, but at a time long after the previous cut. In the breakfast montage, Welles chronicles the breakdown of Kane's first marriage in five vignettes that condense 16 years of story time into two minutes of screen time. Welles said that the idea for the breakfast scene [...] "was stolen from The Long Christmas Dinner of Thornton Wilder... a one-act play, which is a long Christmas dinner that takes you through something like 60 years of a family's life." [...] The film often uses long dissolves to signify the passage of time and its psychological effect of the characters, such as the scene in which the abandoned sled is covered with snow after the young Kane is sent away with Thatcher.|$|E
500|$|Welles had {{originally}} wanted the entire film to use high contrast cinematography, resembling engravings of the Middle Ages; only the opening title sequence uses this technique. The film's most famous sequence is the Battle of Shrewsbury; only about 180 extras were available and Welles used <b>editing</b> <b>techniques</b> {{to give the}} appearance of armies of thousands. Welles filmed all of the battle scenes in long takes, but cut the shots into fragments to create the effect that he wanted. It took ten days to shoot the scenes and six weeks to edit what became a six-minute sequence. In filming the sequence, Welles often used hand-held cameras, wide-angle lenses, slow motion and speed up shots, static shots, swish pans and constant rapid movement of the characters to create a kinetic and chaotic atmosphere. Anderegg has said that [...] "in the end, both armies have become one huge, awkward, disintegrating war machine, a grotesque robot whose power source slowly begins to fail and finally comes to a frozen halt. Verbal rhetoric—language itself—seems, for the moment, both irrelevant and obscene." ...|$|E
