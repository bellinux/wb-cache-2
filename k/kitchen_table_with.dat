5|$|Bamber {{told the}} court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had loaded the rifle, {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then left it on the <b>kitchen</b> <b>table,</b> <b>with</b> a full magazine {{and a box of}} ammunition, before leaving the house. When he left it in the kitchen, it did not have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he said; they had been on the rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E
5|$|Jane sits at her <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> {{a pistol}} when a figure leaps through her window and hacks {{off one of}} her arms. The wound sprays blood over the kitchen walls before Jane falls to the floor. The killer {{continues}} to hack at her until she is dead, at which point Neal is revealed to be the murderer. Upon learning the details of Berti's sadistic murder spree, Neal recovered a previously repressed memory involving his murder of a girl who had sexually humiliated {{him when he was}} a youth in Rhode Island. The memory torments Neal and inflames his previously repressed lust for blood, driving him insane.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 {{he worked}} as a doctor in Renfrew. A resident, Bill Johnston, {{recalled}} the time when, as a lad, Dr. Banda came to his home to see his father who had a nasty boil {{on the back of his}} neck. His father was a respected church elder in the town. Dr. Banda took a small bottle from his case, asked for some boiling water and poured some into the bottle. Emptying the water out, he quickly placed the open end on Bill's father's boil where of course it stuck as the steam condensed. With a cry of anguish, his father leapt to his feet and chased the doctor round the <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> the bottle fastened to his neck. Bill was dumbfounded at hearing his father use language that he had never heard before. Note, however, that this account conflicts with other sources, notably Philip Short's biography which cites a letter from Banda stating that he moved to London in 1945, two months after the armistice, buying a practice in the North London suburb of Harlesden. Initially, he stayed at Mrs. French's house, with Mr. French joining them in October 1945. Later, he bought his own house in Brondesbury Park. Mrs. French moved in as his housekeeper, together with her husband. According to other accounts, he lodged in a hotel, The Conway Court, in Paddington run by Mrs Janet Evans. Reportedly, he avoided returning to Nyasaland for fear that his new-found financial resources would be consumed by his extended family back home.|$|E

2500|$|The autopsy also {{revealed}} a [...] "vegetable or fruit material which may represent pineapple" [...] which JonBenét had eaten {{a few hours}} before her death. Photographs of the home taken on the day when JonBenét's body was found show a bowl of pineapple on the <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> a spoon in it. However, both Patsy and John Ramsey said they did not remember putting the bowl on the table or feeding pineapple to JonBenét. Police reported that they found JonBenét's nine-year-old brother Burke Ramsey's fingerprints on the bowl. The Ramseys have always maintained that Burke slept through the entire episode until he was awakened several hours after the police arrived.|$|E

6000|$|A {{few hours}} later Deacon Latham came into {{the house with a}} milk-pan full of pease. He set this down {{on one end of the}} <b>kitchen</b> <b>table,</b> <b>with</b> his straw hat beside it, and then took a chair at the other end and fell into the {{attitude}} of the day before, when he sat in the parlor with Lydia and Miss Maria waiting for the stage; his mouth was puckered to a whistle, and his fingers were held above the board in act to drub it. Miss Maria turned the pease out on the table, and took the pan into her lap. She shelled at the pease in silence, till the sound of their pelting, as they were dropped on the tin, was lost in their multitude; then she said, with a sharp, querulous, pathetic impatience, [...] "Well, father, I suppose you're thinkin' about Lyddy." ...|$|E

I have endured all the rest. I have given up my chance of a musical education, when Aunt Nan offered it, that I might stay home and help Willard pay the mortgage off--if it doesn't pay us off first--and I have, which was much harder, accepted the fact that we can't possibly afford to send Ray to the Valley Academy, even if I wore the same hat and coat for four winters. I did not grumble when Uncle Joel came here to live because he wanted to be 'near his dear nephew's children.' I felt it my Christian duty to look pleasant when we had to give Cousin Caroline a home to save her from the poorhouse. But my endurance and philosophy, and worst of all, my furniture, has reached a limit. I cannot have Aunt Josephina come here to spend the winter, because I have no room to put her in." ...|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know how}} the {{household}} furniture came to be sold for the family benefit, or who sold it, except that I did not. Sold it was, however, and carried away in a van; except the bed, a few chairs, and the <b>kitchen</b> <b>table.</b> <b>With</b> these possessions we encamped, as it were, in the two parlours of the emptied house in Windsor Terrace; Mrs. Micawber, the children, the Orfling, and myself; and lived in those rooms night and day. I have no idea for how long, though {{it seems to me}} for a long time. At last Mrs. Micawber resolved to move into the prison, where Mr. Micawber had now secured a room to himself. So I took the key of the house to the landlord, who was very glad to get it; and the beds were sent over to the King's Bench, except mine, for which a little room was hired outside the walls in the neighbourhood of that Institution, very much to my satisfaction, since the Micawbers and I had become too used to one another, in our troubles, to part. The Orfling was likewise accommodated with an inexpensive lodging in the same neighbourhood. Mine was a quiet back-garret with a sloping roof, commanding a pleasant prospect of a timberyard; and when I took possession of it, with the reflection that Mr. Micawber's troubles had come to a crisis at last, I thought it quite a paradise.|$|E

5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> fully loaded, <b>with</b> a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|R

"Now, let me see," [...] said Aunt Cyrilla reflectively, {{tapping the}} snowy <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> {{the point of}} her plump, dimpled forefinger, [...] "what shall I take? That big fruit cake for one thing--Edward does like my fruit cake; and that cold boiled tongue for another. Those three mince pies too, they'd spoil before we got back or your uncle'd make himself sick eating them--mince pie is his besetting sin. And that little stone bottle full of cream--Geraldine may carry any amount of style, but I've yet to see her look down on real good country cream, Lucy Rose; and another bottle of my {{raspberry}} vinegar. That plate of jelly cookies and doughnuts will please the children and fill up the chinks, and you can bring me that box of ice-cream candy out of the pantry, and that bag of striped candy sticks your uncle brought home from the corner last night. And apples, of course--three or four dozen of those good eaters--and a little pot of my greengage preserves--Edward'll like that. And some sandwiches and pound cake for a snack for ourselves. Now, I guess that will do for eatables. The presents for the children can go in on top. There's a doll for Daisy and the little boat your uncle made for Ray and a tatted lace handkerchief apiece for the twins, and the crochet hood for the baby. Now, is that all?" ...|$|E
60|$|Minister Anderson's {{house is}} in {{the main street of}} Websterbridge, not far from the town hall. To the eye of the eighteenth century New Englander, it is much grander than the plain {{farmhouse}} of the Dudgeons; but it is so plain itself that a modern house agent would let both at about the same rent. The chief dwelling room has the same sort of kitchen fireplace, with boiler, toaster hanging on the bars, movable iron griddle socketed to the hob, hook above for roasting, and broad fender, on which stand a kettle and a plate of buttered toast. The door, between the fireplace and the corner, has neither panels, fingerplates nor handles: it is made of plain boards, and fastens with a latch. The table is a <b>kitchen</b> <b>table,</b> <b>with</b> a treacle colored cover of American cloth, chapped at the corners by draping. The tea service on it consists of two thick cups and saucers of the plainest ware, with milk jug and bowl to match, each large enough to contain nearly a quart, on a black japanned tray, and, {{in the middle of the}} table, a wooden trencher with a big loaf upon it, and a square half pound block of butter in a crock. The big oak press facing the fire from the opposite side of the room, is for use and storage, not for ornament; and the minister's house coat hangs on a peg from its door, showing that he is out; for when he is in it is his best coat that hangs there. His big riding boots stand beside the press, evidently in their usual place, and rather proud of themselves. In fact, the evolution of the minister's kitchen, dining room and drawing room into three separate apartments has not yet taken place; and so, from the point of view of our pampered period, he is no better off than the Dudgeons.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Brandreth {{met them}} {{at the door of}} his mother's cottage. It was a very small cottage on the outside, with a good deal of stained glass en évidence in leaded sashes; where the sashes were not leaded and the glass not stained, the panes were cut up into very large ones, with little ones round them. Everything was very old-fashioned inside. The door opened {{directly}} into a wainscoted square hall, which had a large fireplace with gleaming brass andirons, and a carved mantel carried to the ceiling. It was both baronial and colonial in its decoration; there was part of a suit of imitation armour under a pair of moose antlers on one wall, and at one side of the fireplace there was a spinning-wheel, with a tuft of flax ready to be spun. There were Japanese swords on the lowest mantel-shelf, together with fans and vases; a long old flint-lock musket stretched across the panel above. Mr. Brandreth began to show things to Annie, and to tell how little they cost, as soon as the ladies entered. His mother's voice called from above, [...] "Now, Percy, you stop till I get there!" [...] and in a moment or two she appeared from behind a portière in one corner. Before she shook hands with the ladies, or allowed any kind of greeting, she pulled the portière aside, and made Annie admire the snug concealment of the staircase. Then she made her go upstairs and see the chambers, and the second-hand colonial bedsteads, and the andirons everywhere, and the old chests of drawers and their brasses; and she told her some story about each, and how Percy picked it up and had it repaired. When they came down, the son took Annie in hand again and walked her over the ground-floor, ending with the kitchen, which was in the taste of an old New England kitchen, with hard-seated high-backed chairs, and a <b>kitchen</b> <b>table</b> <b>with</b> curiously turned legs, which he had picked up in the hen-house of a neighbouring farmer for a song. There was an authentic crane in the dining-room fireplace, which he had found in a heap of scrap-iron at a blacksmith's shop, and had got for next to nothing. The sideboard he had got at an old second-hand shop in the North End; and he believed it was an heirloom from the house of one of the old ministers of the North End Church. Everything, nearly, in the Brandreth cottage was an heirloom, though Annie could not remember afterward any object that had been an heirloom in the Brandreth family.|$|E
50|$|At the <b>kitchen</b> <b>table,</b> L.D. argues <b>with</b> his {{daughter}} Rae, age 15, about her beliefs. Maxine, the wife, comes home and notices L.D. is drunk. Maxine sides with Rae, saying she can like what she likes. In {{a moment of}} fury, L.D. throws a pickle jar through the window, shattering the glass. Maxine gives L.D. an ultimatum: he must pack his things and go or she'll call the police. L.D. starts packing, stuffing not only his belongings into his suitcase but also vindictively taking womanly toiletries he could make no use of. Taking one last look around, about to leave for good, L.D. says he has {{one more thing to}} tell his wife and daughter but, suddenly inarticulate, he is unable to put what he feels into words.

3000|$|To {{verify the}} {{concepts}} of neuro-symbolic recognition, it was applied to a building automation environment.

The <b>kitchen</b> comprises a <b>table</b> <b>with</b> eight chairs and a kitchen cabinet including a stove, a sink, a dishwasher, and a coffee machine. For testing the recognition model, the kitchen was equipped with sensors of different types: tactile floor sensors, motion detectors, door contact sensors, window contacts, light barriers, temperature sensors, a humidity sensor, brightness sensors, a microphone, and a camera. From these sensor data, different scenarios had to be perceived following the information processing principles proposed in Section 4.1. As by these measures, the kitchen became an [...] "intelligent" [...] system capable of autonomously perceiving {{what is going on}} in it, it got the name Smart Kitchen.|$|R
