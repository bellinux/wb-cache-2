We compute <b>double</b> <b>cuts</b> {{of the loop}} amplitudes via a decomposition into a four-dimensional and a - 2 *epsilon-dimensional integration. The four-dimensional integration is performed using spinor integration or other efficient techniques. The remaining integral in - 2 *epsilon dimensions is cast in terms of bubble, triangle, box, and pentagon master integrals using dimensional shift identities. The method yields results valid for arbitrary values of epsilon. Comment: 4 pages. v 2 : references change...|$|R

2500|$|Filing is {{combination}} of grinding and saw tooth cutting using a file. Prior {{to the development}} of modern machining equipment it provided a relatively accurate means for the production of small parts, especially those with flat surfaces. [...] The skilled use of a file allowed a machinist to work to fine tolerances and was the hallmark of the craft. [...] Files can vary in shape, coarseness, and whether the teeth or single cut or <b>double</b> <b>cut</b> depending on what application the file is to be used for. Today filing is rarely used as a production technique in industry, though it remains as a common method of deburring.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of dual band <b>double</b> U-slot <b>cut</b> rectangular microstrip antenna is presented. The reported <b>double</b> U-slot <b>cut</b> rectangular microstrip antenna yields dual and wide band operation in 2100 and 5400 MHz frequency bands. To analyze the dual band response at above frequencies, the resonance curve plots and surface current distributions for equivalent rectangular patch and single U-slot and further <b>double</b> U-slot <b>cut</b> rectangular microstrip antennas were studied. The first U-slot primarily optimizes {{the position of}} TM 01 and TM 20 modes of the patch to realize dual and wide frequency response in 2100 MHz frequency range. Further the second U-slot optimizes the position and impedance at higher order modified modes like TM 22, TM 31 and TM 02 modes to yields dual frequency response in 5400 MHz frequency band. Since the higher order modes are involved in dual band response, the cross polar levels in higher frequency band are higher as compared to first frequency band. The present study gives an insight into the functioning of U-slot cut patches at their lower as well as higher order frequency bands...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} method for the direct {{extraction}} of rational contributions to one-loop scattering amplitudes, missed by standard four-dimensional unitarity techniques. We use generalised unitarity in D = 4 − 2 ǫ dimensions to write the loop amplitudes in terms of products of massive tree amplitudes. We find that the rational terms in 4 − 2 ǫ dimensions can be determined from quadruple, triple and <b>double</b> <b>cuts</b> {{without the need for}} independent pentagon contributions using a massive integral basis. The additional massdependent integral coefficients may then be extracted from the large mass limit which can be performed analytically or numerically. We check the method by computing the rational parts of all gluon helicity amplitudes with up to six external legs. We also present a simple application to amplitudes with external massless fermions...|$|R
40|$|We {{compute the}} next-to-maximally-helicity-violating one-loop n-gluon amplitudes in N= 1 super-Yang-Mills theory. These amplitudes contain three negative-helicity gluons and an {{arbitrary}} number of positive-helicity gluons, and constitute the first infinite series of amplitudes beyond the simplest, MHV, amplitudes. We assemble ingredients from the N= 4 NMHV tree super-amplitude into previously unwritten <b>double</b> <b>cuts</b> {{and use the}} spinor integration technique to calculate all bubble coefficients. We also derive the missing box coefficients from quadruple cuts. Together with the known formula for three-mass triangles, this completes the set of NMHV one-loop master integral coefficients in N= 1 SYM. To facilitate further use of our results, we provide their Mathematica implementation.

40|$|Purpose - This paper {{studies the}} effects of varying laser trim {{patterns}} on several performance parameters of thin film resistors such as the {{temperature coefficient of resistance}} (TCR) and target resistance value. Design/methodology/approach - The benefits and limitations of basic trim patterns are taken into consideration and the plunge <b>cut,</b> <b>double</b> plunge <b>cut</b> and the curved L-cut were selected to be modelled and tested experimentally. A computer simulation of the laser trim patterns has been developed for the modelling process of the resistors. The influence of the trim length and resistor dimensions on the TCR performance and resistance value of the resistors is investigated. Findings - It is found that variation in trim length, within the range of 5 to 15 mm, can give significant increases in the TCR of the thin films. Thus, for the plunge TCR cut can reach up to 11. 51 ppm/oC, for the <b>double</b> plunge <b>cut</b> up to 14. 34 ppm/oC and for the curved L-cut up to 5. 11 ppm/oC. Originality/value – Research on {{the effects of}} various laser trimming geometries on the TCR and target resistance accuracy is limited, especially for patterns such as the curved L-cut,which is investigated in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Stress {{distribution}} in {{short and long}} fibers and their surrounding matrix bays of a finite width hybrid composite lamina is examined. The lamina is subjected to a tensile load of magnitude "P " at infinity, while its matrix is assumed to take only shear (shear-lag theory). The bay adjacent to the first intact filament is allowed to experience a plastic zone of size 2 α, due to excessive shear load owned by cracks formed by <b>double</b> <b>cuts</b> along each filament. The plastic zone is assumed to behave as elastic–perfectly plastic. The short fibers are simulated by assuming two successive breaks along each filament. The effect of the plastic zone on short fiber load bearing capability, as well as stress concentration in the first intact filament is fully investigated. The effect of hybridization, {{in the presence of}} the plastic zone, is also examined on short fiber load bearing behavior...|$|R
