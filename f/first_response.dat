5|$|In March 1928, Pflueger {{published}} his submission {{for a new}} building to house the San Francisco Stock Exchange, featuring strong Zigzag Moderne themes with classicist notes. Miller and Pflueger won the competition for the commission. Eight months later, the Exchange committee decided instead to rebuild the Sub-treasury building at 301 Pine Street while keeping its Tuscan columns and entrance steps, requiring a completely new approach. Pflueger's <b>first</b> <b>response</b> was a sketch with little ornamentation. Construction began in December 1928. By January 1929, Pflueger's plans indicated prominent sculptures, bas-reliefs, inscriptions and carvings, to be detailed by local artists.|$|E
40|$|By perianal {{electrical}} stimulation and EMG recording from the external anal sphincter three responses were found with latencies of 2 - 8, 13 - 18 and 30 - 60 ms, respectively.

They were characterised by constant latency and uniform pattern, were not fatigued by repeated stimulation, were most dependent on placement of stimulating and recording electrodes, and always had a higher threshold than the third response. The third response was constantly present in normal subjects. It had the longest EMG response and the latency decreased with increasing stimulation to a minimum of 30 - 60 ms.

5|$|Neumann {{delivered}} {{a letter from}} the queen to Grover Cleveland, who began his second non-consecutive term as president on March 4. The Cleveland administration commissioned the Blount Report, and based on its findings, concluded that the overthrow of Liliʻuokalani was illegal, and that Stevens and American military troops had acted inappropriately in support of those who carried out the overthrow. On November 16, Cleveland sent his minister Albert S. Willis to propose a return of the throne to Liliʻuokalani if she granted amnesty to everyone responsible. Her <b>first</b> <b>response</b> was that Hawaiian law called for property confiscation and the death penalty for treason, and that only her cabinet ministers could put aside the law in favor of amnesty.|$|E
5|$|Published in {{response}} to Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790), which was a defence of constitutional monarchy, aristocracy, and the Church of England, and an attack on Wollstonecraft's friend, the Rev Richard Price at the Newington Green Unitarian Church, Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) attacks aristocracy and advocates republicanism. Hers was the <b>first</b> <b>response</b> in a pamphlet war that subsequently {{became known as the}} Revolution Controversy, in which Thomas Paine's Rights of Man (1792) became the rallying cry for reformers and radicals.|$|E
5|$|Michael's <b>first</b> <b>response</b> was {{to order}} the Armeniac army to attack Thomas. The Armeniacs were easily {{defeated}} in battle and Thomas proceeded through the eastern parts of the Armeniac Theme to occupy the frontier region of Chaldia. His conquest of the Armeniac province was left incomplete because the Abbasids, {{taking advantage of the}} Byzantine civil war, launched raids by land and sea against southern Asia Minor, where Thomas had left few troops. Instead of returning to face these raids, Thomas launched a large-scale invasion of his own against Abbasid territory in spring 821, either in Syria (according to Bury and others) or in Arab-held Armenia (according to Treadgold). Thomas then sent an emissary to the Caliph al-Ma'mun, who was sufficiently impressed by Thomas's show of force to receive his proposals, especially in view of the Caliphate's own problems with the rebellion of the Khurramites under Babak Khorramdin. Thomas and Ma'mun concluded a treaty of peace and mutual alliance. The Caliph allowed Thomas to recruit men from Arab-ruled territories, and gave leave for him to cross the border and travel to Arab-held Antioch, where he was crowned emperor by the iconophile Patriarch of Antioch, Job. In exchange, Thomas is said to have promised to cede unspecified territories and become a tributary vassal of the Caliph, though the agreement's exact terms are left unclear in the sources. At about the same time, Thomas adopted a young man of obscure origin, whom he named Constantius and made his co-emperor.|$|E

40|$|Background: Aphasic {{impairments}} of {{lexical retrieval}} (LR) {{can be attributed}} to different underlying deficits such as problems with meaning (semantic deficits), with word selection (lexical deficits) and sound selection (phonological deficits). Research in the area is unclear {{on the extent to which}} types of errors produced are a reliable indicator of the underlying impairment. It is also unclear in the literature whether recording of all errors made on a picture naming task can reveal more about LR breakdown than recording only <b>first</b> <b>responses.</b> Aims: To determine if analyses of error types produced by ‘first responses’ or ‘all responses’ given on a naming task provide more accurate information for differential diagnosis of impairment in spoken word production. Additionally, to establish whether error type predicts underlying impairment in anomia. Methods & Procedures: Cross-sectional data was obtained from 34 Irish participants who were diagnosed with aphasia secondary to a cerebrovascular accident. Naming performance was assessed by means of the complete set of the Boston Naming Test (BNT; Kaplan et al. 2001). Additional tasks of comprehension and repetition were also carried out using subtests of the Comprehensive Aphasia Battery (CAT; Swinburn et al. 2004). Participants were categorised into ‘main error type’ groups. Level of breakdown in spoken word production was predicted by results of comprehension and repetition tests. This was then compared with BNT error types produced. Outcomes & Results: Analyses of error profiles indicated that there was no significant difference between <b>first</b> <b>responses</b> given on the BNT and all <b>responses</b> given. Therefore, <b>first</b> <b>responses</b> provide an accurate account of an individual’s error profile. Chi-square analysis reported that there was a significant association between main error types produced and the predicted level of breakdown in LR. Conclusion: <b>First</b> <b>responses</b> given on a naming task may be sufficient in predicting the level of breakdown in LR. However, additional tasks of comprehension and repetition may be of clinical benefit to confirm a diagnosis, and to plan treatment accordingly...|$|R
