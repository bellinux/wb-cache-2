5|$|Climate can {{influence}} bat distribution, movements and biogeography, access to food resources, timing of reproduction and emergence {{and rate of}} energy expenditure. In combination with other factors, including ongoing loss and degradation of habitat, global climate change or global warming presents a serious and increasing threat to bats and other fauna. The affinity of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat for riparian zones in arid and semi-arid environments renders it potentially vulnerable {{to the effects of}} water stress and <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> events. Ecological factors that qualify the bristle-faced free-tailed bat as being at increased risk of the potential impacts of global climate change include habitat (species that rely on riparian habitats in water stress prone environments), foraging type (aerial hawking insectivore), roost type (tree hollow specialist), biogeography (species with limited dispersal ability, limited ranging behaviour) and <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> (species that occur in regions where there is an increasing risk of extreme temperature events or changes in rainfall patterns).|$|E

5|$|Argentina is {{vulnerable}} {{and will likely}} be significantly impacted by climate change. Temperatures have increased {{in the last century}} while the observed changes in precipitation are variable, with some areas receiving more and other areas less. These changes have impacted river flow, increased the frequency of <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> events, and led to the retreat of glaciers. Based on the projections for both precipitation and temperatures, these climatic events are likely to increase in severity and create new problems associated with climate change in the country.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to local}} {{conditions}} it was sometimes {{necessary for the}} Commission to deviate from its standard design. In places prone to <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> or earthquakes, such as Thailand and Turkey, stone-faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal headstones. These measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sodden ground. In Italy, headstones were carved from Chiampo Perla limestone {{because it was in}} more plentiful supply. In Struma Military Cemetery, in Greece, to avoid risk of earthquake damage, small headstones are laid flush to the ground. Due to their smaller size, the markers often lack unit insignia.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper offers}} {{insights}} for assessing organizational resilience {{to the effects}} of climate change, specifically to climate and <b>weather</b> <b>extremes.</b> The assessment of organizational resilience to climate and <b>weather</b> <b>extremes</b> brings about several challenges due to (1) uncertainties about future climate change outcomes across temporal and spatial scales and (2) a lack of insight into what lead to organizational resilience, or which variables should be measured in a given study. We suggest methodological pathways for organizational managers to identify properties of future climate and <b>weather</b> <b>extremes</b> and to include them in resilience assessments. We also suggest approaches to identify factors that promote organizational resilience to selected climate and <b>weather</b> <b>extremes.</b> Findings are intended to help managers to understand how organizational resilience to climate and <b>weather</b> <b>extremes</b> can be enhanced...|$|R

40|$|Climatological {{records show}} a {{trend of the}} {{increasing}} occurrence of <b>extreme</b> <b>weathers</b> caused by global climate change. One form of <b>extreme</b> <b>weathers</b> is heavy rainfall which, combined with rising sea levels, made highways in some subtropical regions susceptible to flooding. Flooding in these regions causes noticeable damages to flexible highway pavements. However, {{little research has been}} conducted to quantify such damages and develop possible mitigation measures. This study developed a method to incorporate flood risk into the structural analysis of flexible pavements, examined the effects of flooding on pavement materials and structures through laboratory tests and design simulations, and recommended better pavement design and management strategies. Flexible pavement is found to be significantly affected by flooding. Future climate change and the resultant increase of flooding frequency pose a serious challenge to the reliability of flexible highway pavements. To mitigate the detrimental effects of flooding, pavement thickness and drainage system need to be adequately designed and post-flood traffic control may need to be imposed.

5|$|The {{geographic}} and geomorphic characteristics of Argentina tend to create <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> conditions, often leading to natural disasters that negatively impact the country both economically and socially. The Pampas, {{where many of}} the large cities are located, has a flat topography and poor water drainage, making it vulnerable to flooding. Severe storms can lead to tornados, damaging hail, storm surges, and high winds, causing extensive damage to houses and infrastructure, displacing thousands of people and causing significant loss of life. Extreme temperature events such as heat waves and cold waves impact rural and urban areas by negatively impacting agriculture, one of the main economic activities of the country, and by increasing energy demand, which can lead to energy shortages.|$|E
5|$|After {{transitioning}} into a post-tropical cyclone, Katia {{moved quickly}} across the North Atlantic and toward Europe, prompting the Met Office to begin warnings citizens for potential impacts over subsequent days on September9. Three days later, the organization raised a yellow severe weather alert {{for all of}} Ireland {{and most of the}} United Kingdom, with a more severe amber alert hoisted across Northern Ireland, the northernmost United Kingdom, and southern Scotland; both alerts warned of the potential for gale-force winds. Concurrently, Met Éireann outlined an <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> warning across Ireland, alerting residents to the potential for 130km/h (80mph) winds, downed trees, damaged buildings, and flooding. Irish ferries cancelled a number of its sails between Dublin and Holyhead. The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute warned of gale-force winds along the coastline of Sweden, although a brunt of the rainfall was expected in neighboring Norway.|$|E
5|$|As weather {{conditions}} shift due to climate change, bees change their behaviors. When it rains, bees {{do not go}} out and during extremely hot weather they try to gather water to keep the colony cool. Climatologists have predicted that the occurrence of <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> events (such as intense rainy seasons and prolonged drought) will increase as the climate continues to change. Additionally, in regions that experience increasingly more rain, pollen will be washed away more easily {{making it more difficult}} for bees to provide for their colonies. Meanwhile, in environments experiencing prolonged drought, flower environments may dwindle with dry weather. These patterns lead to less suitable and viable environments in which bees can thrive. A British journal published projections of plant diversity loss against spatial sensitivity; the researchers found major species loss {{in the southern part of}} the UK forcing bee colonies further north.|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change in}} the western United States has {{increased}} the frequency of <b>extreme</b> ﬁre <b>weather</b> events and is projected to increase the area burned by wildﬁre in the coming decades. This changing ﬁre regime, coupled with increased high-severity ﬁre risk from a legacy of ﬁre exclusion, could destabilize forest carbon (C), decrease net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and consequently reduce the ability of forests to regulate climate through C sequestration. While management options for minimizing the risk of high-severity ﬁre exist, {{little is known about}} the longer-term carbon consequences of these actions in the context of continued <b>extreme</b> ﬁre <b>weather</b> events. Our goal was to compare the impacts of extreme wildﬁre events on carbon stocks and ﬂuxes in a watershed in the Sierra National Forest. We ran simulations to model wildﬁre under contemporary and <b>extreme</b> ﬁre <b>weather</b> conditions, and test how three management scenarios (no-management, thin-only, thin and maintenance burning) inﬂuence ﬁre severity, forest C stocks and ﬂuxes, and wildﬁre C emissions. We found that the effects of treatment on wildﬁre under contemporary ﬁre weather were minimal, and management conferred neither signiﬁcant reduction in ﬁre severity nor increases in C stocks. However, under <b>extreme</b> ﬁre <b>weather,</b> the thin and maintenance burning scenario decreased mean ﬁre severity by 25 %, showed signiﬁcantly greater C stability, and unlike the no-management and thin-only management options, the thin and maintenance burning scenario showed no decrease in NEE relative to the contemporary ﬁre weather scenarios. Further, under <b>extreme</b> ﬁre <b>weather</b> conditions, wildﬁre C emissions were lowest in the thin and maintenance burning scenario, (reduction of 13. 7 Mg C/ha over the simulation period) even when taking into account the C costs associated with prescribed burning. Including prescribed burning in thinning operations may be critical to maintaining C stocks and reducing C emissions in the future where <b>extreme</b> ﬁre <b>weather</b> events are more frequent...|$|R

5|$|Most farming {{was based}} on the lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, {{settlements}} of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers. They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land, helping to offset some of the problems of <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> conditions. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective in heavy soils and cheaper to feed than horses. Obligations to the local lord usually included supplying oxen for ploughing the lord's land on an annual basis and the much resented obligation to grind corn at the lord's mill.|$|E
5|$|The United States, {{with its}} large size and {{geographic}} variety, includes most climate types. To {{the east of}} the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south. The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as are the populated territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific. <b>Extreme</b> <b>weather</b> is not uncommon—the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur within the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire started}} on August 17, 2013 at 3:25pm in the Stanislaus National Forest, east of Groveland, when a hunter {{lost control of}} an illegal campfire.

The fire had only burned 40 acres when it was discovered, but it grew to 10,000 acres within 36 hours and 100,000 acres after just four days. In two days, in mid-August, the fire burned nearly 90,000 acres. The fire's rapid spread was attributed to drought and <b>extreme</b> <b>weather</b> conditions. It burned into backcountry areas of Yosemite National Park. The park remained open, and though Yosemite Valley was never in danger, the fire did burn 78,895 acres of parkland.
