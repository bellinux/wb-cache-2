40|$|AbstractMethodology of {{optimization}} of grinding cycles for intragrinding operations {{requires a}} process model, establishing {{the connection between}} the cutting force occurring in the process of a metal removal and the regime parameters and other technological factors that {{have a significant impact on}} its intensity. Process management of <b>internal</b> <b>grinding</b> is carried out for a given cycle which simultaneously involves two controlling regime parameters: radial and axial infeeds actively changing in the process of grinding while the other operating parameters are constant during the entire grinding cycle. The developed model allows calculating the changes of the cutting force depending on variable values of infeeds. Fluctuation of infeeds values in each opening section is caused not only by the control program but also the kinematics of the <b>internal</b> <b>grinding</b> process. It should also be noted that the model of the cutting force provided in this article considers kinematics, peculiarities of the <b>internal</b> <b>grinding</b> and connects the cutting force with the processing regimes (radial and axial infeeds, number of billet and wheel revolutions) and main technological factors (physical mechanical properties of grinding metal, geometric parameters of a contact zone of the billet and the wheel, wheel characteristic, degree of blunting, etc.) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} and intractable problem of domestic engineering industry is the low productivity of operations performed on CNC machines. The {{reason for this}} is the absence of standards and methodologies for the design of optimal cycles for CNC machines. As a result, in practice, one has to manually choose processing modes which presents no {{solution to the problem of}} low productivity, as this method generates losses, particularly in relation to automated production intra grinding processing on CNC machines in series production. To solve this problem the research, primarily, proposes a methodology for the design of optimal multivariable stepwise cycles <b>internal</b> <b>grinding</b> processing, allowing to calculate as follows: optimal values of the radial flow at all stages of the cycle; the optimum value of the axial feed at all stages of the cycle; optimal allocation deduct allowance on the steps of the cycle for radial and axial feeds, which provide the minimum cycle time, given the technological constraints of the objective function. As a mathematical method of optimization of grinding cycles, applied dynamic programming method (DPM) is used. The application of the DPM is permissible due to the fact that this method does not require constructing an a priori bounds of the permissible restrictions and is not sensitive to the properties of management models and constraints. The optimality criterion is adopted, the minimum cycle time of grinding. The optimality criterion is adopted being the minimum cycle time of grinding. The use of DPM allows taking into account any number of technological limitations of the objective function (limitations on the accuracy and other quality indicators; performance properties of a circle; design parameters of the machine). The designed <b>internal</b> <b>grinding</b> cycles of processing are multi-dimensional and reflect the dependence interdependence speed axial flow, radial flow and amount of removed stock.

40|$|AbstractAn {{integral}} part of the optimization problem of intragrinding operations is the mathematical model of the process, establishing the necessary dependences between the wheel characteristics, processing modes, cutting force, properties of the processed metal, requirements to the processing surface and other grinding conditions. The necessity to account for the plurality connections between the different technological factors, affecting the productivity of processing parts and having a wide range of variation in the process model of intragrinding processing, forces to abandon the narrow-band, partial power-low empirical dependences, which present only the processing conditions similar to the conditions of the experiment. Considering that power limitations of regime parameters are at the basis of the intragrinding operations performance management, we have developed a wide-range analytical model of cutting forces which is required to establish the interrelations between the program and the actual infeeds through the elastic properties of technological system and coverage of the main technological factors, influencing the change of the cutting force.

40|$|During the {{production}} process development for the manufacture of an experimental supersonic aircraft, an unusual and difficult grinding problem was encountered. Arising from the experimental work carried out to solve this problem, a method of numerically evaluating the efficiency of grinding wheels and coolants, was developed. This evaluation {{is based on the}} fact that under constant and limited grit load conditions which can be set up in a surface grinding operation, the edge of the grinding wheel which makes initial contact with the workpiece breaks down and forms an approach angle as shown in Fig. 1. Once this angle is established, its dimensions remain almost constant, and with continued use of the wheel the angle recedes across the face of the wheel. It is the recognition of the variables which control the dimensions of this approach angle (alpha) together with the rate at which it recedes across the wheel face, and the amount of work done at each increment of recession, on which the numerical evaluation of the efficiency of the grinding wheel and the causes of the limitations are based. A description of the methods used for determining the characteristics of grinding wheels and coolants are included together with the calculations which are necessary when the data obtained from tests carried out on the surface grinding machine are to be interpreted and applied to the cylinder <b>grinding</b> <b>internal</b> <b>grinding</b> or form grinding processes...|$|R

The tool {{consists of a}} grinding head, {{the front and rear}} actuators mounted on an actuator holder and a laser diode set in the back end of the holder. Tool attitude (position and inclination) is detected by the laser diode and two PSDs (Position-Sensitive Detector). The guiding axis is set using optical device located in front of the tool. In series 1, the performance of the tool is examined with respect to the grinding forces. When grinding the cemented carbide with a depth of cut of 30 μm and the high speed steel with a depth of cut of 30 μm, the torques are 8 % and 20 % of the maximum torque of the air motor, respectively.

40|$|Precision {{cylindrical}} grinding is used {{extensively in the}} manufacture of precision components in the metal-mechanical industry in general. Modern CNC grinding machines have improved this process with respect to the positioning and rigidity of the machine-workpiece-tool system, allowing the production of high precision parts with low dimensional tolerances. Besides the difficulties inherent to the process, awareness has grown in recent years regarding the environmental issues of cutting fluids. As a response, the industry has begun to seek alternative lubrication and cooling methods. Among the various existing techniques, Minimum Quantity Lubrication (MQL) has been considered as an alternative. This technique can be understood as a combination of conventional lubrication and cooling methods and dry machining, in which a small quantity of lubricating oil mixed with compressed air flow is delivered in the wheel-workpiece interface. The MQL technique is already widely employed in machining processes with tools of defined geometry (e. g. turning), in which produces very satisfactory results. However, the MQL technique has been little explored in grinding processes (non-defined tool geometry), in which the really effective heat removal methods are required due to the frictional heat generation in the grinding zone. Consequently, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the plunge cylindrical <b>internal</b> <b>grinding</b> operation when using the MQL technique and the conventional cooling method. Roughness and roundness were the output parameters. As a result, it was found that the best values of roughness Ra were obtained with the conventional lubrication method.

No significant differences were detected among the cooling methods when analyzing the roundness results.
