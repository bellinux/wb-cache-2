[...] While EpiInfo has many statistical procedures, correlation is not one of them. Rather correlation is found by regression. [...] This means that EpiInfo will not produce a single table showing correlations among multiple variables. According to the Zelig <b>installation</b> <b>manual,</b> use of Zelig requires that R and several of its libraries already be installed, and the installation also requires some degree of background in R. One limit of MicrOsiris is in handling the output.

5000|$|Routing {{and design}} of vacuum tubing layout {{is very similar to}} drain-waste-vent (DWV) plumbing, with the {{exception}} that pipe pitch or gradient for drainage is not required. Vacuum system designs share with DWV designs a concern about eliminating internal roughness, ridges, burrs, sharp turns, pockets, or other obstructions to smooth flow that might cause build-up of material into pipe blockages. Tubing for central vacuums has a few peculiar constraints of its own, and a few unusual capabilities, such as the ability to run a pipe straight upwards after a sufficiently long horizontal [...] "running start". In some jurisdictions, fire code regulations require that an intumescent firestop collar be installed around the pipe when it penetrates a firewall. If a pipe runs through an unheated space, it may require external pipe insulation to prevent water vapor from condensing inside. These and other installation details are described in <b>installation</b> <b>manuals</b> available from manufacturers.|$|R

This phase was followed by developing and prototyping of the solar water pumping system. Based on the system design, financial models were constructed to understand cost of ownership and pay-back calculations for the consumer. The prototype was commissioned and tested at the local municipality followed by post installation monitoring and evaluation.

40|$|Practical Applications of Evolutionary Computation to Financial Engineering” {{presents}} {{the state of}} the art techniques in Financial Engineering using recent results in Machine Learning and Evolutionary Computation. This book bridges the gap between academics in computer science and traders and explains the basic ideas of the proposed systems and the financial problems in ways that can be understood by readers without previous knowledge on either of the fields. To cement the ideas discussed in the book, software packages are offered that implement the systems described within. The book is structured so that each chapter can be read independently from the others. Chapters 1 and 2 describe evolutionary computation. The third chapter is an introduction to financial engineering problems for readers who are unfamiliar with this area. The following chapters each deal, in turn, with a different problem in the financial engineering field describing each problem in detail and focusing on solutions based on evolutionary computation. Finally, the two appendixes describe software packages that implement the solutions discussed in this book, including <b>installation</b> <b>manuals</b> and parameter explanations...|$|R
40|$|This manual {{has been}} {{prepared}} by the NCAT Development Corporation to document the monitoring equipment installation techniques and approaches used by NCAT and ESL in the LoanSTAR program {{and is based on}} actual in-field experiences. It is more than simply an <b>installation</b> <b>manual,</b> however. It is really a process handbook. For example, copies of all forms and documentation used in the installation process are included and instructions for their use are provided. Essentially, this manual is designed {{to be used as a}} guidebook by future monitoring subcontractors in the LoanSTAR Program to ensure both continuity of methodology and instrumentation technology. Each step in the monitoring equipment installation process is described and extensive "how-to" information is provided. Illustrations accompany the text throughout the manual. The Texas LoanSTAR (Loans to Save Taxes and Resources) Program is a $ 98. 6 million revolving loan fund to finance energy conservation retrofits in Texas government buildings. The loans are repaid through energy cost savings resulting from the retrofits. These energy cost savings are verified through an extensive metering and monitoring program conducted by the Texas A&M University Energy Systems Laboratory (ESL). The National Center for Appropriate Technology (NCAT) and its for-profit subsidiary, the NCAT Development Corporation, have been the principal monitoring instrumentation subcontractors to ESL throughout the Program's life...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} DICOM worklist software for radiological modalities {{from the viewpoint of}} risk management, to reduce mislabeled image data in an electronic archiving environment. We focused on the following five points: 1) the effectiveness of the DICOM modality worklist, 2) problems involving incorrect patient and image data, 3) the presence of incorrect profiles despite the transfer of patient profiles online via the DICOM worklist, 4) ways to eliminate entry failure, and 5) further examination even if data entry were correct. Materials and Methods: Retrospective data of patient profiles with image data were evaluated both before and after installation of DICOM modality worklist management software at Sakai Municipal Hospital. All radiology modalities were connected to RIS terminals in which DICOM modality worklist software was installed. Patient profiles were transferred online from RIS terminals to the modalities. It was not necessary for technologists to type patient profiles in usual examinations. Results: Before installing the DICOM modality worklist software, the number of data entry errors was 31 and the rate was 6. 4 % of 487 examinations. After <b>installation,</b> <b>manual</b> data entry occurred in 80 of 1, 994 examinations. The number of data entry errors for patient profiles was two, and the rate was 0. 1 % of the total examinations (p< 0. 0001). Before installing the DICO...|$|E
40|$|This project {{introduced}} incremental {{improvements to}} PowerGuard system components and manufacturing processes to {{significantly reduce the}} costs of a PowerGuard system. The improvement resulted in a lower cost, higher impact PV product. During Phase II, these accomplishments have resulted in: A production rate of greater than 400 PowerGuard tiles per shift (20 MW/year) manufacturing capacity; 57 % cost reduction for PowerGuard tile; UL listing for four additional PowerGuard tiles configurations; Improved quality of finished goods due to improved tooling and processes in manufacturing, simultaneously improving throughput and lowering cost of $ 3. 80 Wp for large systems. In Phase III of this contract, PowerLight will continue {{efforts to improve the}} manufacturing processes for PowerGuard. Specific performance objectives during phase III are as follows: Demonstrate system cost reduction from $ 3. 80 /Wp to $ 3. 05 /Wp for large systems; Establish or assess the performance of dedicated PowerGuard PV module plant capacity of 2 MW per year; Complete wind tunnel testing of all design refinements; Produce an <b>installation</b> <b>manual</b> and training program for installing PowerGuard systems; Establish performance of manufacturing modifications based on assessment of commercial systems which incorporate the new features and processes; and Finalize UL, International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO), and international listings of PowerGuard improvements.
