40|$|In many cases, the redeveloped {{waterfront}} acts as {{a driver}} for the re-launch of the entire economy of a city, often re-locating it in an international context. For this reason, many cities, even of a small and medium size, are adopting the recovery of their waterfront or of their former port areas in light of economical benefits and of a higher quality of life. The process of waterfront areas transformation {{can be understood as}} a extraordinary laboratory for the analysis of the complexity in the relationship between built and natural environment, for comparing experiences in a context of complexity (aims and parties involved), of uncertainty (institutional and financial nature, involving activities and markets) and of importance of urban landscape. International exchanges and comparisons are indispensable means of knowledge. Furthermore investigate the ‘state of the art’ in terms of identification of “best practices” at national, European and International levels, is strategic for proposing and promoting tools, methods and guidelines for dealing effectively in actual and future cases of waterfront area revitalization and for training the responsible bodies and decision makers on the choices to be made.

40|$|The ‘Forage for Later-life Learning’ Project is an EU Lifelong Learning <b>Programme</b> <b>Grundtvig</b> multi-lateral network, funded 2012 - 2015. Its {{rationales}} are {{the development}} of a database of knowledge on later-life learning and the use of that database as a means of promoting discussion, understanding, recognition and change in later-life learning. This article discusses the objectives and rationale of the ForAge database and considers its intended target audiences. In particular, it argues that the database became eclectic, deliberately identifying and drawing on different “kinds” of knowledge. It shows how the main database categories, which determined how the knowledge was “constructed” were allowed to evolve and define themselves as the content of the database increased. The article discusses the justification and operational implications of the inclusion of material according to criteria of “relevance, quality and usefulness” and in both English and in other European languages. The article concludes that the database does not reveal the presence in Europe of a significant volume of fundamental research-based knowledge on later-life learning; that much of the knowledge collected is based on the presumption that later-life learning has second-order goals and that the database usefully hedges its bets on what counts as “knowledge” in the field of later-life learning...|$|R

40|$|This Thesis {{provides}} a short analysis of theory, history, {{and practice of}} the so-called folkehjskole (folk high schools) that represents a Danish contribution to pedagogy with worldwide importance. Those schools resulted from {{the social and cultural}} climate in Denmark {{as well as from the}} intellectual creativity of the churchman, philosopher, historian, member of parliament, and bard N. F. S. Grundtvig as well as of the pedagogue and organizer Ch. Kold. The first one was founded in 1844 in Rdding, North Schleswig. The political situation after the war between Prussia and Denmark and the need to improve the education and competence of rural youth to develop their farms provided an impetus for those schools as well. Those free schools were run on new principles, independently from the state school system, and influenced very positively the development and democratization of Danish society. After some time elapsed, similar schools were founded in the whole Scandinavia, to lesser extent in other European countries, in some Scandinavian and other communities in the USA, during the recent years in some developing countries. Lifelong education, supported by those schools, is providing inspiration for the contemporary European Union, as testified by the <b>Grundtvig</b> <b>programme.</b> The intellectual foundations, organization [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{a massive}} {{expansion}} {{of education in}} Portugal, since the 1970 ’s, educational attainment {{of the adult population}} in the country remains low. The numbers of working-age people in some form of continuing education are among the lowest, according to the OECD and EU- 27 statistics. Technological Schools(TS), initially created in the 1990 ’s, under the umbrella of the Ministry of Economy in partnership with industry and industrial associations, aimed to prepare qualified staff for industries and services in the country, particularly in the engineering sector, through the provision of post secondary non-university programmes of studies, the CET (Technological Specialization Courses). Successful CET students are awarded a DET(Diploma of Technological Specialization), which corresponds to Vocational Qualification level IV of the EU, according to the latest alteration (2005) of the Education Systems Act (introduced in 1986). In this, CET’s are also clearly defined as one of the routes for access to Higher Education (HE), in Portugal. The PRILHE (Promoting Reflective and Independent Learning in Higher Education) multinational project, funded by the European Socrates <b>Grundtvig</b> <b>Programme,</b> aimed to identify the learning processes which enable adult students in higher education to become autonomous reflective learners and search best practices to support these learning processes. During this research, both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to determine how students organise their studies and develop their learning skills. The Portuguese partner in the project’ consortium used a two case studies approach, one with students of Higher Education Institutions and other with students of TS. This paper only applies to students of TS, as these have a predominant bias towards engineering. Results show that student motivation and professional teaching support contribute equally to the development of an autonomous and reflective approach to learning in adult students; this is essential for success in a knowledge economy, where lifelong learning is the key to continuous employment...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} lifelong {{learning}} first appeared during 1800 's. It gradually changed and enhanced under social, economic and technological effects. Although it became {{from time to}} time a current issue in the 60 's and 70 's, {{it was only in the}} 90 's, when it became an important point for society. The concept of lifelong learning, which has to be implemented in our rapid developing world, where information, documents and technology change immediately, underlines the fact that learning is a never-ending process. In all parts of life such as formal education, work life or daily life; people need information continuously which means that they need to "learn" throughout their lifetime. Learning is not a process that is completed with compulsory education, in the contrary it is an activity which should last for a lifetime. In order to adapt oneself to the enormous changes in information, documents and technology world, to have an occupation, to be informed continuously in order to keep up with the developments in one's professional area, to be an individual or to be an active member of society, people need in every step of their life access to new information and skills or they need to develop their existing knowledge and skills. Therefore to fulfil the increasing need for information, information centres, especially public libraries are of great importance at this point. Thus, public libraries are institutions, which tolerate access to every layer of society and besides support formal education and enable individuals opportunities to learn independently. Public libraries, which have an important role in providing chance equality in education, intellectual freedom, critical thinking, providing free service to everyone without making any discrimination, are considered as democratic institutions which will ensure the greatest support for lifelong learning. Industrialised countries, which have re examined the role of public libraries in the new shaping social, and economic world, are putting the programmes to work which they are going to benefit from. The <b>Grundtvig</b> <b>Programme</b> within the Sokrates Education Programme of the European Union, is an example for the dissemination of adult education and lifelong learning among society. In this work the terms "adult education" and "lifelong learning" are explained i « lexically, their definitions are given, the Grundvig Programme, part of the Sokrates Program in the European Education Programme has been examined thoroughly and it has been tried to reveal how the programme of which public libraries are part of, could be implemented in Turkey in the progress of adult education and lifelong learning...|$|E
