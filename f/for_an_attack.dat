5|$|Fishers {{have had}} a long history of contact with humans, but most of it has been to the {{detriment}} of fisher populations. Unprovoked attacks on humans are extremely rare, but fishers will attack if they feel threatened or cornered. In one case, a fisher was blamed <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on a six-year-old boy. In another case, a fisher is believed to be responsible <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on a twelve-year-old boy.|$|E

5|$|As {{the great}} numbers of troops from both armies gathered, {{it was widely}} assumed in the North {{that this would be}} the battle to end the war. Grant, {{reinstated}} by Halleck at Lincoln's and Stanton's urging, left Fort Henry and traveled by boat up the Tennessee River to rejoin his army with orders to advance with the Army of the Tennessee into Tennessee. Grant's main Union army was located at Pittsburg Landing, while 40,000 Confederate troops converged at Corinth. Brigadier General William Tecumseh Sherman assured Grant that his green troops were ready <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack.</b> Grant agreed and wired Halleck with their assessment. Grant, whose forces numbered 45,000, wanted to attack the Confederates at Corinth, but Halleck ordered him not to attack until Major General Don Carlos Buell arrived with his division of 25,000. Meanwhile, Grant prepared <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on the Confederate army of roughly equal strength. Instead of preparing defensive fortifications between the Tennessee River and Owl Creek, and clearing fields of fire, they spent most of their time drilling the largely inexperienced troops while Sherman dismissed reports of nearby Confederates.|$|E

5|$|Disembarking at Marseilles, the 12th Battalion was {{initially}} posted to the Fleurbaix sector of France. After involvement in minor operations, it {{transferred to the}} Somme in July, where it participated in the Battle of Pozières, its first major French action. Newland was posted to command A Company from 8 August, and was subsequently moved to Sausage Valley {{along with the rest}} of the 12th Battalion in preparation <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on Mouquet Farm.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson {{had arrived}} in North Carolina in early September 1780 to recruit troops for the Loyalist militia and protect the flank of Lord Cornwallis' main force. Ferguson issued a {{challenge}} to the rebel militias to lay down their arms or suffer the consequences. In response, the Patriot militias led by Benjamin Cleveland, James Johnston, William Campbell, John Sevier, Joseph McDowell and Isaac Shelby rallied <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on Ferguson.|$|E

2500|$|What was not {{generally}} agreed on was the superiority, at least <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>attacking</b> aircraft, of fixed forward-firing guns, aimed by pointing the aircraft at its target, rather than flexible weapons, aimed by a gunner other than the pilot.|$|R

5|$|In December 1864, the {{dictator}} of Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, {{took advantage of}} Brazil's military intervention in Uruguay to establish his country as a regional power. The Paraguayan army invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso (currently the state of Mato Grosso do Sul), triggering the Paraguayan War. Four months later, Paraguayan troops invaded Argentine territory in preparation <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on Rio Grande do Sul.|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{attacked}} {{under conditions}} many considered unfavourable, but his marksmanship {{allowed him to}} make an approach fast enough to escape the return fire of the two aircraft flying on either flank of the target. Marseille's excellent eyesight {{made it possible for}} him to spot the opponent before he was spotted, allowing him to take the appropriate action and manoeuvre into position <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 12 June the {{soldiers}} of the 9th Infantry Division, who had come ashore the previous day, readied themselves <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on the battery. At 8:30a.m., {{the men of the}} 2nd Battalion of the 39th Infantry Regiment started their attack but found only an empty battery. The fighting over the battery took a heavy toll on both sides, 307 German soldiers died to defend it and about as many Americans died to take it.|$|E

50|$|The {{terrain of}} Arghandab {{district}} presented several difficulties <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>attacking</b> force. Situated in a lush agricultural area along the Arghandab River, it is crossed by many deep irrigation ditches which limit and channelize {{the movement of}} armoured vehicles, {{as well as providing}} cover for the defenders.|$|R

5|$|Sesma's {{battalion}} of approximately 725 men and artillery camped {{on the opposite}} side of the Colorado, at a distance halfway between the two Texian camps. To prevent Sesma's troops from using the William DeWees log cabin, Sherman ordered it burned. Three Mexican scouts from Sesma's army were captured by Sherman's men, and although Sherman argued <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on Sesma's troops, Houston was not ready.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese convoy arrived off Waga Waga at 8:15pm on 29 August, {{and began}} landing troops and supplies. While this {{was taking place}} the {{warships}} shelled Allied positions around Gili Gili and by 11:30pm, had completed their landing. The shelling was not significant, however, and no casualties resulted from it. Throughout 30 August, the Australians carried out patrolling operations while the Japanese laid up in the jungle in preparation <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> that night.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe intimated that {{a period}} of good weather was now due over France, Belgium and {{southern}} Britain.

50|$|Irish Coach Declan Kidney has {{observed}} that disallowing mauls at the breakdown means defences stay spread out, meaning less space for attackers, {{making it more}} difficult <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>attacking</b> side to advance, resulting in more kicking. In this case the ELVs, rather than encouraging attacking play have produced the opposite effect.|$|R
5|$|The Meccans {{were eager}} to avenge their defeat. To {{maintain}} economic prosperity, the Meccans needed to restore their prestige, which had been reduced at Badr. In the ensuing months, the Meccans sent ambush parties to Medina while Muhammad led expeditions against tribes allied with Mecca and sent raiders onto a Meccan caravan. Abu Sufyan gathered an army of 3000 men and set out <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on Medina.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} the raid was disputed. Collier claimed the action was {{successful}} in destroying military stores <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on Fort Cumberland (although such stores had not been delivered to Machias), while the defenders claimed that they had successfully prevented the capture of Machias and driven off the British.|$|E
5|$|Warren's squadron, which {{included}} Gibraltar, supplied nearly 700 seamen and marines <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on the French batteries investing the town.

5|$|Although Fannin, Dimmitt, and Linn {{continued}} to push <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on Goliad, Texian attention soon shifted towards Gonzales, {{where a small}} group of Texians were refusing to obey orders from Ugartechea. Colonists eagerly rushed to assist, and on October 2 the Battle of Gonzales officially opened the Texas Revolution. After learning of the Texian victory, Cos made haste for Béxar. He left with the bulk of his soldiers on October 5, but because he was unable to find adequate transportation most of his supplies remained at La Bahía.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating {{that the}} Japanese would strike at Port Moresby again, the {{garrison}} was strengthened and MacArthur ordered {{the establishment of}} new bases at Merauke and Milne Bay to cover its flanks. The Battle of Midway in June 1942 led to consideration of a limited offensive in the Pacific. MacArthur's proposal <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on the Japanese base at Rabaul met with objections from the Navy, which favored a less ambitious approach, and objected to an Army general being in command {{of what would be}} an amphibious operation. The resulting compromise called for a three-stage advance. The first stage, the seizure of the Tulagi area, would be conducted by the Pacific Ocean Areas, under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. The later stages would be under MacArthur's command.|$|E
5|$|Aware of {{what had}} {{happened}} in the upper delta region, Chinh abandoned plans <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> on the Sơn Tây garrison and fled, but he was captured a few days later by French authorities. The French imposed a curfew on Hanoi, the capital of northern Vietnam for 12 days. French troops were sent to Sơn Tây and Phu Tho where attacks by the VNQDD had been planned, and reinforcements were sent to Tuyên Quang, Nam Định and Hải Dương as well. Garrisons that consisted entirely of Vietnamese were reinforced with French soldiers.|$|E
