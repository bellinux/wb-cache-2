5|$|In 2012 it {{was adapted}} as a two-part {{television}} drama for the BBC. The production starred Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Wraysford and Clémence Poésy as Isabelle Azaire, and {{was directed by}} Philip Martin, based on a screenplay by Abi Morgan. The historian Edward Madigan favourably compared the television adaptation to Steven Spielberg's War Horse as a successful <b>evocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experience of the World War I trenches.|$|E
5|$|When David's first book, Mediterranean Food was {{published}} in 1950 the British public was still enduring food rationing after the Second World War. Her <b>evocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> everyday plenty and excellence of Mediterranean food was revelatory, and although she did not reach a wide public until cheap paperback editions of her books {{came out in the}} mid 1950s, reviewers immediately spotted her importance.|$|E
5|$|When Crèvecœur {{offered his}} {{manuscript}} essays to the London publishers Davies & Davis in 1782, they were initially {{skeptical about the}} potential for the Letters to be successful. However, the work proved to be instantly popular in England for a variety of reasons. Proponents of political reform such as William Godwin and Thomas Paine approved of the radical anti-government implications of its message. Romantic writers admired, and were influenced by, its <b>evocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> natural landscape and the individual's relationship to it. More widely, in the final years of the Revolutionary War, the public was eager for the documentary detail Letters provided about America. The popularity of the book led to a second edition being called for only a year later.|$|E
50|$|Begin's impassioned rhetoric, {{laden with}} pathos and <b>evocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holocaust, appealed to many, but was deemed {{inflammatory}} and demagoguery by others.|$|R
2500|$|The National Film Award for Best Direction {{was given}} to Aravindan for [...] "the film's courageous and uncompromising {{exploration}} of an ancient epic theme through a pronouncedly new cinematic language, for making the camera speak more eloquently than <b>the</b> introspective characters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ramayana, for projecting against <b>the</b> vast backdrop <b>of</b> nature, for matching profound philosophical ideas with astonishing <b>evocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beauties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physical world".|$|R
50|$|As one of Australia's most {{significant}} artists, Tillers {{has been at}} <b>the</b> forefront <b>of</b> contemporary art for over three decades. Since 1981 Tillers has used his signature canvasboards to explore themes relevant to contemporary culture, from <b>the</b> centre/periphery debates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1980s, to <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> migration, displacement and diaspora. Most recently, his paintings have been concerned with place, locality and <b>evocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landscape.|$|R
5|$|The Gaelic poet Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair {{spent much}} of his life in the Hebrides and made {{frequent}} references to them in his poetry, including in An Airce and Birlinn Chlann Raghnaill. The best known Gaelic poet of her era, Màiri Mhòr nan Òran (Mary MacPherson, 1821–98), embodied the spirit of the land agitation of the 1870s and 1880s. This, and her powerful <b>evocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hebrides—she was from Skye—has made her among the most enduring Gaelic poets. Allan MacDonald (1859–1905), who spent his adult life on Eriskay and South Uist, composed hymns and verse in honour of the Blessed Virgin, the Christ Child, and the Eucharist. In his secular poetry, MacDonald praised the beauty of Eriskay and its people. In his verse drama, Parlamaid nan Cailleach (The Old Wives' Parliament), he lampooned the gossiping of his female parishioners and local marriage customs.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} decoration was extraordinarily rich. The walls were decorated with marble, {{the roof was}} gilded, while the narthex featured a depiction of the baptism of Constantine the Great. Fragments of ivory, amethyst, gold and colored glass, originally inlaid in the marble sculptures, have also been found at the site, as well as fragments of mosaics. The deliberate <b>evocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Solomonic Temple was further reinforced by the preponderance of motifs such as palm trees, pomegranates and lilies in the church's decoration. A notable characteristic, {{which has not been}} attested before in Constantinopolitan art and architecture, is the extensive use of Sassanid Persian decorative motifs such as friezes of running palmette and pomegranate leaves or symmetric geometric and vegetal patterns. Persian motifs became increasingly popular in the 6th century, and were also used in the decoration of the Hagia Sophia. Another exceptional find are ten relief plaques bearing the images of Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Apostles; such images are very rare due to the destruction of human representations in the Iconoclasm of the 8th and 9th centuries.|$|E
25|$|The evocative Estampes for piano (1903) give {{impressions}} of exotic locations. Debussy {{came into contact}} with Javanese gamelan music during the 1889 Paris Exposition Universelle. Pagodes is the directly inspired result, aiming for an <b>evocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pentatonic structures employed by Javanese music.|$|E
50|$|All Mormon temples are <b>evocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Temple <b>of</b> Solomon. <b>The</b> Salt Lake Temple <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Church <b>of</b> Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is {{oriented}} towards Jerusalem and {{the large}} basin used as a baptismal font is mounted on <b>the</b> backs <b>of</b> twelve oxen, as was <b>the</b> brazen sea <b>of</b> Solomon's Temple.The Cardston Alberta, Laie Hawaii, and Mesa Arizona Temples <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Church <b>of</b> Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are all designed after <b>the</b> style <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second temple built by King Herod.|$|R
50|$|Briefly {{captured}} illustrations {{though these}} lithographs may be, their accuracy and detail, together with <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> tonal observation {{give them a}} satisfying quality. From his sketches also came the larger watercolours on rough dark paper, distinguished by his characteristic use of blue and sharp white highlights. At their best these are fine, sensitive <b>evocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> familiar coastline and countryside round his home, contrasting with the exotic scenes he encountered abroad, from <b>the</b> craggy slopes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alps and the Andes, to <b>the</b> shining domes <b>of</b> Moscow and Constantinople.|$|R
25|$|Because <b>the</b> work {{involves}} <b>evocation</b> <b>of</b> demons, <b>the</b> Abramelin {{operation has}} been compared to Goetic magic, especially by European scholars. However, the text's primary focus is upon <b>the</b> invocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guardian angel, and modern works on the subject tend to focus upon this aspect as well.|$|R
25|$|The {{second major}} film, {{directed}} by and starring Kenneth Branagh in 1989, attempts {{to give a}} more realistic <b>evocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period and lays more emphasis on the horrors of war. It features a mud-spattered and gruesome Battle of Agincourt. Where Olivier staged the comic scenes as comedy, Branagh played them as serious drama.|$|E
25|$|Three major film adaptations {{have been}} made. The first, {{directed}} by and starring Laurence Olivier in 1944, is a colourful and highly stylised version which {{begins in the}} Globe Theatre and then gradually shifts to a realistic <b>evocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Agincourt. Olivier's film was made during the Second World War and {{was intended as a}} patriotic rallying cry {{at the time of the}} invasion of Normandy.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Gondwanaland's Wide Skies was {{released}} and even long time {{followers of the}} band were surprised at the progression of Carolan's compositions. Gone were the earthy good time romps and quiet moments of reflection. Now complex panoramic chord clusters enveloped the arrangements in an almost overwhelming <b>evocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky and all that happens in and under it. This album's multi-layered textures and moods earned the band even greater critical respect.|$|E
50|$|Conroy's {{published}} works {{include the}} memoir Stop-Time (1967); {{a collection of}} short stories, Midair (1985); a novel, Body and Soul (1993), which is regarded as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finest <b>evocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experience <b>of</b> being a musician; a collection of essays and commentaries, Dogs Bark, but the Caravan Rolls On: Observations Then and Now (2002); and a travelogue, Time and Tide: A Walk Through Nantucket (2004). His fiction and non-fiction have appeared in such journals as The New Yorker, Esquire, GQ, Harper's Magazine and Partisan Review. He was named a Knight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Order <b>of</b> Arts and Letters by the French government.|$|R
40|$|Religious Architecture: Anthropological Perspectives {{develops}} an anthropological {{perspective on}} modern religious architecture, including mosques, churches and synagogues. Borrowing {{from a range}} of theoretical perspectives on space-making and material religion, this volume looks at how religious buildings take their place in opposition to the secular surroundings, how they, as <b>evocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sublime, help believers to move beyond <b>the</b> boundaries <b>of</b> modern subjectivity, and how they, in their common sense definition, function as community centers in urban daily life. The volume includes contributions {{from a range of}} anthropologists working in the UK, Mali, Brazil, Spain and Italy...|$|R
40|$|<b>Evocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ‘sharing economy’ claim {{disruptions}} through digital technology. Style is {{put forward}} {{to focus on}} subtle changes to the form and content of work through digital sharing. Digital sharing is a postwork style with ambiguous implications for worker identity and expression. Digital technologies share work through distributing the workplace beyond a fixed location and by enrolling individuals as workers through processes of communication circulation. These styles of sharing challenge fixed spaces and times of work with utopian and dystopian postwork possibilities. This argument is supported through practices of shared digital work constituting co-working offices in Manchester, Cambridge and London...|$|R
25|$|Gondwanaland's next album, Wide Skies (1992) {{came after}} touring {{northern}} Australia and includes guest performances by Bobby Bunuggurr, Cleis Pierce, Maroochy Barambah, Andrew de Teliga (Sirocco), Blair Greenberg, Pee Wee Ferris and Carl Zhang. It {{was produced by}} Martin Armiger, recorded from 1990 to 1992 in both Sydney and the Northern Territory, and was released by WEA. Gone were the earthy good time romps and quiet moments of reflection, now complex panoramic chord clusters enveloped the arrangements in an almost overwhelming <b>evocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky and all that happens in and under it. This album's multi-layered textures and moods earned the band even greater critical respect. Wide Skies was nominated at the ARIA Music Awards of 1993 for 'Best Indigenous Release'.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the things}} the movie does best is {{transport}} you back in time and into nature. In the early scenes as Joel leaves his aunt's home to travel across the South by rickety bus and horse and carriage, you feel the strangeness, wonder and anxiety of a child abandoning everything that's familiar to go to a place so remote he has to ask directions along the way. The landscape over which he travels is so rich and fertile that you can almost smell the earth and sky. Later on, when Joel tussles with Idabell (Aubrey Dollar), a tomboyish neighbor who becomes his best friend (a character inspired by the author Harper Lee), the movie has a special force and clarity in its <b>evocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physical immediacy of being a child playing outdoors.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{a comment}} by Pausanias, who compares {{sacrificial}} practice in Olympia {{with that in}} Pergamon, {{this is the only}} written reference to the altar in all of antiquity. This is all the more surprising because the writers of antiquity otherwise wrote a great deal about such works of art and Ampelius, after all, considered the altar {{to be one of the}} wonders of the world. The absence of written sources from antiquity about the altar has given rise to a number of interpretations. One possibility is that the Romans did not regard this Hellenistic altar as important since it did not date from the classic epoch of Greek, especially Attic, art. Only this art and later <b>evocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> associated values were considered significant and worth mentioning. This view was held particularly by German researchers starting in the 18th century, especially after the work of Johann Joachim Winckelmann became known. The only graphic representations of the altar are on coins of the Roman Empire, which show the altar in a stylized form.|$|E
2500|$|Betjeman's {{poems are}} often humorous, and in {{broadcasting}} he exploited his bumbling and fogeyish image. His wryly comic verse is accessible and {{has attracted a}} great following for its satirical and observant grace. Auden said {{in his introduction to}} Slick But Not Streamlined, [...] "so at home with the provincial gaslit towns, the seaside lodgings, the bicycle, the harmonium." [...] His poetry is similarly redolent of time and place, continually seeking out intimations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eternal in the manifestly ordinary. There are constant <b>evocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physical chaff and clutter that accumulates in everyday life, <b>the</b> miscellanea <b>of</b> an England now gone but not beyond <b>the</b> reach <b>of</b> living memory.|$|R
50|$|Her next poem, 'Maughold Head', was {{published}} at <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> February 1950, after which her poems were published {{regularly in the}} Ramsey Courier. Her first published poem in the Anglo-Manx dialect was 'A Lament', which appeared in September 1950. Her poems were quickly picked up as special <b>evocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Isle <b>of</b> Man and they were recited at meetings of Manx Societies in England alongside poems by the Manx National Poet, T. E. Brown, as early as November 1951. Her poems, 'Maughold Head' and 'In Exile', were set to music by C. Sydney Marshall and had been cut to record by February 1960.|$|R
40|$|Anthropologists are now inescapably {{aware of}} conflict, contradiction, and {{negotiation}} {{in even the}} most seemingly "traditional" socio-cultural orders. The literature on "memory" is particularly rich in illustrations <b>of</b> how contradictory <b>evocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past undergird conflicting performances and assertions <b>of</b> interest in <b>the</b> present. This study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditionally nomadic Yewéssey people documents a genre of performance seldom discussed in the anthropological literature—the ritual performance of forgetting as a means of resolving intractable conflicts and cultural contradictions. This essay is written with an undergraduate or lay audience in mind and is intended to introduce anthropological comparative method, and some of its most important vocabulary, in accessible language. Questions for classroom discussion are provided at the end...|$|R
500|$|In {{a review}} of a {{recording}} of choral works by Reger, Gavin Dixon said that the Requiem is [...] "almost mystical in its use of widely spaced chords, unusual harmonic shifts and dreamy arpeggios in the accompaniment". The program notes for the recording {{say that in the}} [...] "anguished, expressionistic <b>evocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'shuddering', 'forsaken', 'cold' souls, the piece seems determined to expose death in all its grim horror".|$|E
500|$|... "The Inner Light" [...] has {{received}} praise from several music critics and musicologists for its melodic qualities and its <b>evocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meditation experience. Jeff Lynne and Anoushka Shankar performed the song at the Concert for George tribute in November 2002, {{a year after}} Harrison's death. An alternative take of the 1968 instrumental track was released in 2014 on the remastered Wonderwall Music CD. Screenwriter Morgan Gendel named a [...] of the television series [...] as an homage to the song.|$|E

With no human figures present, the bird on the gate becomes the focus. Michael Howard of Manchester Metropolitan University called the painting [...] "an extraordinary <b>evocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> snow-bound chill of a late winter's afternoon. The blueness of the long shadows creates a delicate contrast with the creamy whites {{of the sky and}} landscape".

40|$|In African-American {{science fiction}} writing, the American neo-slave {{narrative}} brings {{a new understanding}} <b>of</b> dystopias in <b>the</b> re-imagining <b>of</b> actual, material and lived dystopia created by <b>the</b> institution <b>of</b> slavery.  In addition to debating <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> freedom {{and how it can}} be achieved, <b>the</b> excavations <b>of</b> social and economic realities found in neo-slave narratives reclaim <b>the</b> lived experience <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past and hold them up to <b>the</b> light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present, allowing us to recognise continuities and to confront the possibility that we are simply repeating history.  In this essay, I read Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad (2016) as dystopian fiction that offers utopian possibilities, if not for the community, then at least for the individual. In his dystopic neo-slave narrative, Whitehead draws on <b>the</b> pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original slave narratives by Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs and transcends the form both by signifying on <b>the</b> literary tropes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gothic and in his steam punk <b>evocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fantastical juxtaposed with lived experience...|$|R
500|$|Smith started Ten Freedom Summers in 1977, when {{he wrote}} the piece [...] "Medgar Evers" [...] as an <b>evocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eponymous civil rights activist gunned down in Mississippi in 1963.

He completed the pieces in a flurry of activity between 2009 and 2011. Smith was inspired to assemble the pieces into one group by August Wilson's 10-play series The Pittsburgh Cycle. Smith has also said of the idea behind Ten Freedom Summers: ...|$|E
500|$|Barcarolles were {{originally}} folk songs sung by Venetian gondoliers. In Morrison's phrase, Fauré's {{use of the}} term was more convenient than precise. Fauré was not attracted by fanciful titles for musical pieces, and maintained that he would not use even such generic titles as [...] "barcarolle" [...] if his publishers did not insist. His son Philippe recalled, [...] "he would far rather have given his Nocturnes, Impromptus, and even his Barcarolles the simple title Piano Piece no. so-and-so." [...] Nevertheless, following the precedents of Chopin and most conspicuously Mendelssohn, Fauré made extensive use of the barcarolle, in what his biographer Jessica Duchen calls [...] "an <b>evocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rhythmic rocking and lapping of water around appropriately lyrical melodies." ...|$|E
500|$|Over the two bridges, Harrison {{presents}} a more engaged perspective. He states that he's [...] "too much in love", but had {{he and his}} lover met [...] "some other day", the outcome might have been different. Fontenot cites these lyrics as the reason why some commentators attach an alternative meaning to the song, whereby the singer is already in a committed relationship and is addressing another woman, {{with the prospect of}} continuing a casual encounter. While considering that Harrison appears to be [...] "playing his options, albeit gently", author John Kruth deems the line [...] "Carve your number on my wall" [...] to be [...] "one of Rubber Souls most enigmatic lyrics" [...] and an <b>evocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imagery in [...] "Norwegian Wood".|$|E
500|$|The šajkača {{was worn}} by Serb {{soldiers}} during <b>the</b> breakup <b>of</b> Yugoslavia. Bosnian Serb reservists and paramilitaries wore the cap during the 1992–95 Bosnian War, {{and it was}} later adopted by Bosnian Serb forces to be <b>the</b> official headgear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Army <b>of</b> Republika Srpska ( [...] , VRS). Following <b>the</b> 1991 Battle <b>of</b> Vukovar, fought during <b>the</b> Croatian War <b>of</b> Independence, Croatian Serb authorities erected gravestones to the Serb soldiers who were killed fighting for the city. These were originally topped with sculptural <b>evocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> šajkača cap. After Vukovar's reintegration into Croatia the gravestones were repeatedly vandalized, leading the Serb community in the town to replace them with more neutral gravestones without any overt military connotations.

40|$|England and the English is Ford Madox Ford’s three-volume {{exploration}} {{of what it}} means to be English, here published in a single volume for the first time in the United Kingdom. Starting with <b>the</b> brilliantly impressionistic <b>evocations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chaotic energy <b>of</b> modern London in the first part, Ford proceeds to delve into the rural past that has always been identified as being at <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> England, before concluding with an investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English character. Throughout, Ford is the watchful outsider, perceptive, humorous and affectionate towards <b>the</b> complexities <b>of</b> Englishness.
