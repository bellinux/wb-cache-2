25|$|The {{next day}} José, Kate, and Ana arrive for the photo shoot at the Heathman Hotel, where Christian is staying. Christian asks Ana out {{for coffee and}} asks if she's dating anyone, {{specifically}} José. Ana replies {{that she is not}} dating anyone. During the conversation, Ana learns that Christian is also single, but he says he is not romantic. Ana is intrigued but believes she is not attractive enough for Christian. Later, Ana receives a package from Christian containing first edition copies of Tess of the d'Urbervilles, which stuns her. Later that night, Ana goes out drinking with her friends and ends up drunk dialling Christian, who informs her that he will be coming to pick her up because of her inebriated state. Ana goes outside to get some fresh air, and José attempts to kiss her, but he is stopped by Christian's arrival. Ana leaves with Christian, but not before she discovers that Kate has been flirting with Christian's brother, Elliot. Later, Ana wakes to find herself in Christian's hotel room, where he scolds her for not taking proper care of herself. Christian then reveals {{that he would like to}} have sex with her. He initially says that Ana will first <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> out paperwork, but later goes back on this statement after making out with her in the elevator.|$|E

60|$|But the old squire had {{understood}} it all; {{had understood}} {{the meaning of}} his nephew's attack; had thoroughly understood also the meaning of his son's defence, and the feeling which actuated it.

60|$|You see, {{they were}} starving. Yes, Sir, they were starving.

With the little wild friends, {{especially}} the little feathered folks, it is a very different matter. You see, they are naturally so active that they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> their stomachs very often in order to supply their little bodies with heat and energy. So when their food supply is wholly cut off, they starve or else freeze to death in a very short time. A great many little lives are ended this way in every long, hard winter storm.|$|E

60|$|Thence {{we went to}} Westminster Hall, {{through a}} gallery with statues on each side,--beautiful statues too, I thought; seven of them, of which four were from the times of the civil wars,--Clarendon, Falkland, Hampden, Selden, Somers, Mansfield, and Walpole.

It sums up all. Its beauty and magnificence are made out of ideas that are gone by.|$|E
60|$|Most {{boys have}} {{observed}} an effect {{similar to this}} in casting lead. When you attempt to cast any thing of lead,--a cannon, for example, or anchor, or even a bullet,--you will observe that as the lead cools, the portion of it which comes {{at the top of}} the mould shrinks and falls in, forming a little pit or depression, which you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> up by pouring in a little more lead. The reason is, that lead, as well as most other melted substances, shrinks when it cools. In the case of the bullet, for instance, all the lead which forms the mass of the bullet within the mould shrinks. The effect of this would be to collapse the sides, were it not that the sides have already become solid by contact with the cold mould. But the lead at the top, having been poured in last, is still fluid; and so that settles down as the lead cools below, and forms the little pit or depression, which the boy presently fills up by pouring in a little more lead.|$|E
