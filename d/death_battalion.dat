5000|$|October 25 The cruiser Aurora sails in as {{the workers}} {{take control of the}} bridges. The Minister of War calls troops to the aid of the deposed government, and Cossacks and the Women's <b>Death</b> <b>Battalion</b> arrive at the Winter Palace and lounge on the Tsar's billiard table. The Provisional Government drafts an appeal to the {{citizens}} attempting to reassert its legitimacy, but that evening a congress is held including delegates {{from all parts of the}} country and the Soviets are voted into power.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the weapons}} and {{preparations}} by the Military Revolutionary Committee, Bolsheviks march immediately on the Winter Palace and demand its surrender. The Provisional Government, seemingly aloof, gives no reply. The Women's <b>Death</b> <b>Battalion</b> surrenders and kills their superiors. A group of Soviets infiltrate the vast palace through the cellars and locate the government forces inside. The Cossacks surrender {{and join the}} Soviets. At the congress, the Mensheviks appeal for a bloodless end to the conflict, depicted as [...] "harping", falls on deaf ears.|$|E

5000|$|In 1907, he {{returned}} to Athens to marry, travelled extensively, and settled in Smyrna in 1913. The beginning of World War I found Smyrna blockaded by the Allies. Soon after, the Ottomans began persecuting Christians. This included setting up [...] "labor battalions" [...] which were soon revealed as actually being <b>death</b> <b>battalions.</b> Most of the Greek population, including Prokopiou and his family, went into hiding. Somehow, he found work as an art teacher for {{the daughter of an}} Ottoman official, which afforded him protection. It was at this time that he created his first war art; depictions of the campaign in the Dardanelles.|$|R

50|$|During the First World War, heavy defeats led to {{the loss}} of {{millions}} of Russian Imperial soldiers. To psychologically energize morale Alexander Kerensky (leader of Russia of the Russian Provisional Government) ordered the creation of the Woman’s <b>Death</b> <b>Battalion</b> in May 1917. After three months of fighting, the size of this all-female unit fell from 2,000 to 250. In November 1917, the Bolsheviks dissolved the unit. Shortly after Russia became part of the Soviet Union (see above for the role of woman in Soviet military) till December 1991.|$|E
5000|$|The {{works of}} Totovents were {{published}} from 1907. He {{is the author}} of Doctor Burbonian (1918), <b>Death</b> <b>battalion</b> (1923), New York (1927), Baku (v. 1-3, 1930-34), Jonathan, Son of Jeremiah novels, stories and dramas. He influenced to Armenian literature especially by his Life on the Old Roman Road autobiographical novel (1930, A piece of sky film by Henrik Malian) which [...] "reflect the society, culture, and mores not only of the Armenians of his childhood but also of their neighbors in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire".|$|E
5000|$|During the Kornilov Affair, Kerensky had {{distributed}} {{arms to the}} Petrograd workers, and by November most {{of these}} armed workers had gone over to the Bolsheviks. On [...] 1917, the Bolsheviks launched the second Russian revolution of the year. Kerensky's government in Petrograd had almost no support in the city. Only one small force, a subdivision of the 2nd company of the First Petrograd Women's Battalion, also known as The Women's <b>Death</b> <b>Battalion,</b> was willing {{to fight for the}} government against the Bolsheviks, but this force was overwhelmed by the numerically superior pro-Bolshevik forces, defeated, and captured. It took fewer than 20 hours for the Bolsheviks to seize the government.|$|E

The human rights NGO COFADEH stated that during the 1980s, Nelson Willy Mejía Mejía was responsible for [...] "7 thousand profiles" [...] of persecuted Hondurans who later disappeared.|$|R
5000|$|Simultaneously, while {{elements}} of the <b>Death</b> Dealer <b>Battalion</b> {{were involved in the}} Mosul Offensive, the unit's rifle company aptly named [...] "Commando" [...] deployed in support of Operation Freedom's Sentinel was called upon by the 101st Airborne Division's 3rd Brigade Combat Team [...] "Rakkasans", to secure regions of Afghanistan that had not seen U.S. Forces in almost 4 years. The company spent an unprecedented 46 days working alongside Special Operations Forces from the United States, Poland, and Romania and the Texas Army National Guard as a part of Task Force [...] "Rak Solid" [...] in the Uruzgan Province, securing a small airstrip just outside of the remote village of Tarin Kot, 120 kilometers away from the nearest base, while tasked as part of an Expeditionary Advisor Package.|$|R
50|$|Claudia's {{death has}} a {{profound}} effect on Amanda, and throughout the series (with help from Nick's own strong moral code), she attempts to change and become a good person. She discovers that she caused the <b>deaths</b> of a <b>battalion</b> of soldiers in World War I, which further influences this change. Amanda finds herself facing up to Immortals, even if she doesn't think she can beat them, when previously, she would have run away.|$|R
5000|$|With none of {{the quartet}} noticing a medieval {{execution}} in their back garden, there is initial tranquility in the house, with Neil randomly hitting himself {{in the face with}} a frying pan, and Vyvyan reading one of Rick's [...] "SS <b>Death</b> Camp <b>Battalion</b> go to Monte Cassino for the Massacre" [...] war comics, leading to an argument with Rick over the comic's content. After Neil prepares to go on a shopping trip for [...] "Everything except Green Globules and Super Mousse", Vyvyan mentions that he had concocted a 'homicidal axe-wielding maniac' potion disguised in a Coca-Cola can, that transforms the drinker into said person, under the guise of a [...] "cure for not being a homicidal axe-wielding maniac", to which Vyvyan mentions the potential size of the market for such an invention.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} Greek and Armenian men {{deported}} {{to the interior}} of Anatolia {{and the number of}} consequent deaths varies across sources. Naimark writes that 30,000 Greek and Armenian men were deported there, where most of them died under brutal conditions. Dimitrije Đorđević puts the number of deportees at 25,000 and the number of <b>deaths</b> at labour <b>battalions</b> at 10,000. David Abulafia states that at least 100,000 Greeks were forcibly sent to the interior of Anatolia, where most of them died.|$|R
50|$|Julius Kuperjanov was {{a school}} teacher who was {{commissioned}} into the Imperial Russian Army during World War I {{and served as a}} commander of partisan and reconnaissance units. In 1918, he joined the Estonian Army {{at the beginning of the}} Estonian War of Independence. On 23 December 1918, Kuperjanov received permission from Colonel Ernst Limberg, commander of the 2nd Division, to form a special purpose partisan unit. Kuperjanov's unit initially consisted of 37 volunteers and was based at Puurmani manor. New volunteers continued to arrive and the unit soon grew to 600 troops, becoming Tartumaa Partisan Battalion. On 13-14 January 1919, the battalion took part in liberating Tartu from the Red Army. After taking back Tartu, the battalion began moving south towards Valga. On 30 January 1919, the battalion reached Paju manor, where they met strong resistance from the Red Army. Tartumaa Partisan Battalion won the ensuing Battle of Paju, but Kuperjanov was badly wounded during the battle and died shortly after on 2 February 1919. Following his <b>death,</b> the <b>battalion</b> was renamed Kuperjanov Partisan Battalion in his honour.|$|R
50|$|The Schutzmannschaften have a {{reputation}} for their Police Battalions (Schutzmannschaft-Bataillonen). Created to support German war efforts, in particular combating anti-Nazi partisans, many of these battalions participated in the Holocaust and caused thousands of Jewish <b>deaths.</b> Usually the <b>battalions</b> were voluntary units and were not directly involved in combat. In total, about 200 battalions were formed. Each battalion had an authorized strength of about 500, but the actual size varied greatly. They {{should not be confused with}} native German police battalions (SS-Polizei-Bataillone) which the Order Police formed between 1939 and 1945 and which also participated in the Holocaust (see Ordnungspolizei Police Battalions and Reserve Police Battalion 101).|$|R
5|$|After Martin's <b>death,</b> the 3rd <b>Battalion,</b> 34th Infantry {{began to}} buckle as {{increasing}} numbers of North Korean troops flooded into Chonan from the Northwest and eastern roads. The battalion suffered heavy casualties, but was saved by the continuous fire laid down by the 63rd Field Artillery Battalion. Between 0800 and 1000, U.S. units began a disorganized retreat from the town, many soldiers deserting their units and running from the battle. Wadlington, now {{in command of the}} 34th Infantry, moved 3rd Battalion to a collecting point south of the town, where 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry was holding a blocking position and had not been engaged. As 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry began to pull back to rally points, 1st Battalion began to come under mortar fire from North Korean forces, but withdrew without engaging them.|$|R
25|$|On 28 August 1918 the British 6th Royal Marine Light Infantry Battalion {{was ordered}} to seize the village of Koikori (Койкары) from the Bolsheviks {{as part of a}} wide {{offensive}} into East Karelia to secure the British withdrawal to Murmansk. The attack on the village was disorganized and resulted in three Marines killed and 18 wounded, including the battalion commander who had ineffectually led the attack himself. A week later, B and C companies, led this time by an army major, made a second attempt to take Koikori, while D company was involved in an attack on the village of Ussuna. The British were again repulsed at Koikori; the army major was killed and both Marine company commanders wounded. D company was also beaten off by Bolshevik forces around Ussuna, with the <b>death</b> of the <b>battalion</b> adjutant, killed by sniper fire.|$|R
5000|$|Captain Shatiel Semenovich Abramov was a Mountain Jew born in Derbent, Dagestan {{in either}} 1918 or 1924. After {{completing}} training in an infantry school in 1940, {{he was drafted}} into the Soviet Army fighting in World War II. He was wounded six times {{during the war and}} awarded numerous military decorations and medals. [...] Abramov was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union for action in Poland after the <b>death</b> of his <b>battalion</b> commander whilst in combat. According to his citation, Abramov took command of the battalion during the fight for a fortress in Poznan, scaling a wall to gain entry, and leading the way to the conquest of the fortress by his battalion. [...] Other activity attributed to him during the war includes walking from Stalingrad to Berlin, and commanding a battalion which killed 400 Germans and captured another 1500.|$|R
5000|$|The US 3rd {{circuit court}} of appeals heard and {{rejected}} this argument in 2008. [...] "Without Anton Geiser {{and other members of the}} SS <b>Death's</b> Head guard <b>battalions,</b> the Nazi concentration camp system could not have accomplished its diabolical objectives," [...] said Eli M. Rosenbaum, Director of Human Rights Enforcement Strategy and Policy in the Human Rights and Special Prosecution Section (HRSP), echoing the court's opinion: [...] "As an armed concentration camp guard in World War II, Geiser 'personally advocated or assisted in the persecution of a group of persons because of race, religion, or national origin.' RRA Relief Act of 1953 § 14(a). Therefore, we will affirm the District Court's order granting the Government's motion for summary judgment and revoking Geiser's citizenship." [...] The United States Supreme Court declined to hear Geiser's appeal in January 2009.|$|R
5000|$|Ideological {{training}} intensified under Eicke's {{command and}} military training for new recruits working the camps was increased. Sometime in August 1938, Eicke’s entire support staff {{was moved to}} Oranienburg (near Sachsenhausen) where the CCI's main office would remain until 1945. Nonetheless, Eicke's role as {{the chief of the}} CCI placed him within the framework of Heydrich’s secret state police; whereas his command of the Death’s Head units, made him accountable to the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA) of the SS. All SS camps' regulations, both for guards and prisoners, followed the Dachau camp model established by Eicke. On 1 April 1937, the SS leadership consolidated the CCI's primary organization, the <b>Death's</b> Head <b>Battalion,</b> into three units; the first for service at Dachau, the second at Sachsenhausen, and the third at Buchenwald. Then during the autumn of 1938, a fourth unit was created for the latest concentration camp at Mauthausen. The CCI also administered the Columbia-Haus concentration camp in Berlin-Tempelhof. One of the CCI's original camps, Lichtenburg (which housed mostly women), was closed in May 1939 when Ravensbrück concentration camp became operational. Secrecy increased among the guards and CCI staff as the number of camps and the supporting network expanded. New camps were [...] "largely shielded from sight" [...] and established in remote places. The war contributed to this expansion as the camp system itself grew to support the Nazi territorial occupation with corresponding rapidity. Just one day after invading Poland (2 September 1939) for instance, the Nazis established the Stutthof concentration camp near Danzig.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the houses}} in the {{southern}} part of the town had been set alight by the French artillery bombardment, and the position was now held only by small groups of Chinese skirmishers. Herbinger decided that the main assault on the town would be made by the 111th Battalion, screened by the Tonkinese and with Brunet and Michel's companies of Schoeffer's Legion battalion in support. The 111th had to advance across a kilometre of open ground, under fire from both the Chinese on the summit of the limestone massif and from a group of Chinese skirmishers in Đồng Đăng itself. The French conscripts moved forward at a brisk trot and eventually reached the Đồng Đăng stream, 200 metres from the outskirts of the town. Here they hesitated. Men began to fall to the enemy's fire. The company officers jumped into the stream to set an example, and waded through waist-high water to the other side. Once they clambered onto dry land the soldiers had only one thought: to reach the shelter of Đồng Đăng and escape from the plunging fire from the limestone massif. In complete disorder, running at full tilt to close the distance as quickly as possible, the young soldiers of the 111th Battalion charged wildly into the blazing town. The astonished company officers raced to place themselves at the front of this impromptu charge, waving their swords above their heads to spur on their men to yet greater efforts. The speed and fury of this improvised attack took the Chinese skirmishers completely by surprise. They tried to evacuate Đồng Đăng but were not fast enough. The soldiers of the 111th trapped laggards in the streets or inside houses, and clubbed or bayoneted them to <b>death.</b> The 111th <b>Battalion</b> then reformed inside Đồng Đăng, where it was in reasonable cover from the Chinese on the limestone massif.|$|R
40|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised {{about the safety of}} the {{electromagnetic}} (microwave) emissions of radars, as well as about the ionizing radiation that is emitted on short distances (< 2 m) by devices in the radars producing the microwaves. We retrospectively compared the cause specific mortality of 4, 417 Belgian professional male military personnel who served in anti-aircraft radar units in Germany between 1963 and 1994 to the cause specific mortality of 2, 932 Belgian military personnel who served {{at the same time in}} the same place in battalions not equipped with radars. Mean follow-up was 26 years in the 2 groups. Age-adjusted rate ratio (RR) and 95 % confidence intervals were derived from a Poisson regression model. Four hundred twenty-four <b>deaths</b> in the <b>battalions</b> groups and 271 deaths in the control battalions occurred (RR = 1. 04 (0. 96 - 1. 14)). For specific causes of deaths, RRs were 1. 22 (1. 03 - 1. 47) for neoplasms and 3. 51 (1. 19 - 10. 3) for symptoms, signs and ill defined conditions. RRs for other causes of death were not significantly different from 1. 00. Among deaths from neoplasms, RR for hemolymphatic cancer was 7. 22 (1. 09 - 47. 9). RRs for other causes of cancer deaths were not significantly different from 1. 00. The results for specific tumor types were all based on very small numbers. The RR for cancer increased with decreasing age and suggested that the RR for cancer increased with the duration of stay in radar battalions. In conclusion, exposure of professional military personnel to anti-aircraft radars that existed in Western Europe from the 1960 s until the 1990 s may have resulted in an increase in the incidence of hemolymphatic cancers. It remains to be established whether this increase is due to microwaves generated by radars or ionizing radiation produced by electronic devices producing the microwaves.
