25|$|Šarūnas {{started going}} to school in Jonas Jablonskis Middle School in 1982 and {{attended}} it till 1987. He {{had to take the}} bus to go to school even though the thermometer outside read minus twenty and he knew {{that the most important thing}} for his parents was that he spent as little time as possible with the toughest people of Partizanai Street. From 1987 to 1993, he was studying at Kaunas 4th Middle School. His first trip destination was Moscow, which he visited before the tournament. Jasikevičius's greatest youth memory in the city was the opening of the first McDonald's in Russia. He remembers that his classmates were listening with their mouths gaping when he was narrating about the French fries, bread rolls with minced beef and fizzy drinks. One of his childhood passions was history, especially about the Native Americans, as well as books about basketball as he was capable of reading a book of more than four hundred pages on basketball in two days. He was also curious about politics, especially when Perestroika began, because of which he was able to travel to Berlin with his father and brother, and was amazed by the visit to the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. His childhood favorite Lithuanian player was Arvydas Sabonis, which he admired more than other Lithuanian superstars, such as Rimas Kurtinaitis and Valdemaras Chomičius, due to his passing. However, his idol was Dražen Petrović, and he wished to be as good as him, watching matches of him over and over again, dozens of times, <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>and</b> <b>hours,</b> and later started imitating him in workouts. After one of his trips, his dad came back with a videocassette recorder, using which he was able to record an NBA All-Star Game with Michael Jordan, Clyde Drexler, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, David Robinson, and later to watch it for couple of years, more than hundred times. Jasikevičius also started to record games of Žalgiris and Petrović every time he was able to. Thanks to the video recorder, he discovered the existence of a no-look pass of Magic Johnson. For him, he was the NBA, not Michael Jordan. His unselfishness, imagination and the way he dribbled, passed between his opponent's legs bewitched Jasikevičius. Consequently, his favorite element of basketball quickly became assisting his teammates, and he was trying to do it like Petrović or Johnson.|$|E

500|$|Their playing {{schedule}} at the Kaiserkeller {{remained the}} same as {{it had been in the}} Indra. Lennon said: [...] "We had to play <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>and</b> <b>hours</b> on end. Every song lasted twenty minutes and had twenty solos in it. That's what improved the playing. There was nobody to copy from. We played what we liked best and the Germans liked it as long as it was loud." [...] The Beatles had been used to simply standing still when they had performed in Liverpool, but Koschmider would come to the front of the stage and loudly shout “Mach schau, mach schau!” ("make [...] show" [...] or, more idiomatically, [...] "put on a show" [...] for the customers). Harrison explained that this prompted Lennon to “dance around like a gorilla, and we’d all knock our heads together.” As Best had been the only one to take O-Level German at school, he could communicate with Koschmider and the clientele better than the rest of the group, and was invited to sing a speciality number called [...] "Peppermint Twist" [...] (while McCartney played the drums) but Best complained that he always felt uncomfortable being at the front of the stage. Willie Limpinski, Koschmider's business manager, decided that the club would attract more customers if it presented continuous live music.|$|E

2500|$|Suzuki joined Sega in 1983 as a programmer. In {{his first}} year, {{he created a}} 2D boxing game called Champion Boxing for Sega's first home game console, the SG-1000. According to Suzuki, the {{executive}} staff at Sega found the game so impressive that they released it in arcades as-is by simply installing an SG-1000 into an arcade cabinet. He was promoted to project leader while still {{in his first year}} at the company. Then, Suzuki began working on another arcade game which would prove to be the big stepping-off point of his career. [...] "To develop this game," [...] Suzuki told G4TV, [...] "I rode on motorcycles a lot. [...] When we came up with the prototype (for the arcades), I would ride on that prototype bike <b>for</b> <b>hours</b> <b>and</b> <b>hours</b> every day." [...] His efforts culminated into the game Hang-On, released in 1985. Hang-On was a success as it broke new ground in arcade technology. It did not feature any traditional controls, as the movement of the on-screen avatar was dictated by the movements the player made with their body on the motorcycle cabinet. This began the [...] "Taikan" [...] trend, the use of motion-controlled hydraulic arcade cabinets in many arcade games of the late 1980s, two decades before motion controls became popular on video game consoles. Running on the Sega Space Harrier hardware, it was also the first of Sega's [...] "Super Scaler" [...] arcade system boards that allowed three-dimensional sprite/texture-scaling at high frame rates. The three-dimensional sprite/tile scaling was handled in a similar manner to textures in later texture-mapped polygonal 3D games of the 1990s. Suzuki stated that his [...] "designs were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from Hang-On. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D. So I was always thinking in 3D." ...|$|E
