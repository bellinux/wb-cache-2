5|$|Following their {{relocation}} to London in 1985, {{members of}} My Bloody Valentine {{lost contact with}} each other while looking for accommodation and Tina Durkin, not confident in her abilities as a keyboard player, left the band. When the remaining four members regained contact with one another, the band decided to audition bassists, as they lacked a regular bassist since their formation. Shields acquired Debbie Googe's telephone number from a contact in London, invited her to audition and subsequently recruited her as a bassist. Googe managed to attend rehearsals, which were centred around <b>her</b> <b>day</b> job. Rehearsal sessions were regularly held at Salem Studios, which was connected to the independent record label Fever Records. The label's management were impressed with the band and agreed to release an extended play, provided the band would finance the recording sessions themselves. Released in December 1985, Geek! failed to reach the band's expectations; however, soon after its release, My Bloody Valentine were performing on the London gig circuit, alongside bands such as Eight Living Lags, Kill Ugly Pop and The Stingrays.|$|E
5|$|Stanton {{wished for}} {{a greater degree of}} {{scholarship}} in The Woman's Bible, but was unable to convince Bible scholars of <b>her</b> <b>day</b> to take part in what was expected to be a controversial project. Scholars continued to avoid addressing the subject of sexism in the Bible until 1964 when Margaret Brackenbury Crook published Women and Religion, a study of the status of women in Judaism and Christianity. In her 1973 book Beyond God the Father, Mary Daly discussed The Woman's Bible, and subsequent works by Letty Russell and Phyllis Trible furthered the connection between feminism and the Bible. Today, biblical scholarship by women has come into maturity, with women posing new questions about the Bible, and challenging the very basis of biblical studies.|$|E

5|$|Warlock signed {{their first}} {{recording}} contract with Mausoleum Records and released their debut album Burning the Witches in 1984. Doro attracted immediately {{the attention of}} fans and press, becoming the spokesperson and the main means of promotion for the band. The mix of traditional heavy metal and power ballads, together with her voice and stage presence led Warlock to success, an exception in the 80s' metal scene dominated by male-fronted metal bands. Warlock signed a new contract with the major label Phonogram and released the albums Hellbound in 1985 and True as Steel in 1986, sharing the stage of European rock festivals {{with some of the}} best hard rock and heavy metal bands of the period. On 16 August 1986, Doro was the first woman to front a metal band at the Monsters of Rock festival in Castle Donington, England, the most important European rock meeting of the 80s. Warlock's long tours in Europe, supporting W.A.S.P. and Judas Priest, pushed Doro to give up <b>her</b> <b>day</b> job as a graphic designer to devote her life to music. In this period she also received vocal coaching.|$|E
