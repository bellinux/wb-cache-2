30|$|Following a {{preliminary}} statistical {{exploration of the}} two time series of ICP and HR, we analysed the multiplex network proposed, focusing on two standard topological network metrics: the mutual interaction, and the average edge overlap (Lacasa et al., Sci Rep 5 : 15508 - 15508, 2014). We compared results obtained for these two <b>indicators,</b> considering <b>windows</b> in which a cross talks event between HR and ICP was detected with windows in which cross talks events were not present.

The development of Virtual Natural Lighting Solutions (VNLS), which are systems that artificially provide natural lighting and view {{comparable to those of}} real windows and skylights, is steered by modelling them as arrays of small light sources resembling a simplified view of a blue sky and green ground. The lighting simulation tool Radiance is employed to predict the space availability, uniformity, ground light contribution on the ceiling, and probability of discomfort glare. The input variables are 2 ̆ 2 distance between windows 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 tilt angles 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 beam angles 2 ̆ 2, and 2 ̆ 2 total luminous fluxes of the sky elements 2 ̆ 2. Sensitivity analysis shows that the total luminous flux positively influences the space availability, the beam angle positively influences the uniformity; and negatively influences average ground light contribution on the ceiling and average probability of discomfort glare. Most of the VNLS models with 114 ° beam angle perform better on the tested performance <b>indicators</b> than real <b>windows</b> under CIE overcast sky...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background We {{present a}} {{multiplex}} network {{model for the}} analysis of Intracranial Pressure (ICP) and Heart Rate (HR) behaviour after severe brain traumatic injuries in pediatric patients. The ICP monitoring is of vital importance for checking life threathening conditions, and understanding the behaviour of these parameters is crucial for a successful intervention of the clinician. Our own observations, exhibit cross-talks interaction events happening between HR and ICP, i. e. transients in which both the ICP and the HR showed an increase of 20 % with respect to their baseline value in the window considered. We used a complex event processing methodology, to investigate the relationship between HR and ICP, after traumatic brain injuries (TBI). In particular our goal has been to analyse events of simultaneous increase by HR and ICP (i. e. cross-talks), modelling the two time series as a unique multiplex network system (Lacasa et al., Sci Rep 5 : 15508 - 15508, 2014). Methods and data We used a complex network approach based on visibility graphs (Lacasa et al., Sci Rep 5 : 15508 - 15508, 2014) to model and study the behaviour of our system and to investigate how and if network topological measures can give information on the possible detection of crosstalks events taking place in the system. Each time series was converted as a layer in a multiplex network. We therefore studied the network structure, focusing on the behaviour of the two time series in the cross-talks events windows detected. We used a dataset of 27 TBI pediatric patients, admitted to Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) between August 2012 and December 2014. Results Following a preliminary statistical exploration of the two time series of ICP and HR, we analysed the multiplex network proposed, focusing on two standard topological network metrics: the mutual interaction, and the average edge overlap (Lacasa et al., Sci Rep 5 : 15508 - 15508, 2014).

40|$|The {{ability of}} some {{hydrides}} to reversibly absorb hydrogen {{under the right}} conditions makes them potential candidates for hydrogen storage, while the change in electrical or optical properties during the metal-insulator transition {{can be used to}} realize devices of technological interests such as two-dimensional hydrogen diffusion <b>indicators</b> and smart <b>windows.</b> This thesis focuses primarily on the investigation of metal hydrides based on magnesium and palladium, in the form of both nanopowders and thin films. In general, samples prepared in the form of nanopowders were intended for hydrogen storage applications, while samples prepared in the form of thin film were intended for switchable mirror applications. Nanopowder samples were synthesized by ball milling, while the thin films were prepared by physical vapor deposition techniques such as pulsed laser deposition and thermal evaporation. The desorption capacity, thermodynamics, and kinetics of Ti- and Ni/Ti-catalyzed Mg hydrides were investigated using Sieverts-type apparatus and differential scanning calorimetry. Based on analysis of the van’t Hoff equation and the Kissinger equation, the addition of Ti and Ni as catalysts has been found to {{play a key role in}} improving the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of magnesium hydride by decreasing the desorption temperature and the activation energy. A combination of Ti and Ni is a more effective catalyst than either Ti or Ni alone, suggesting the existence of a synergetic effect. We propose and demonstrate a simple but effective real-time optical method to determine the Tdes and kinetics of freshly fabricated magnesium nanowires inside a transparent quartz tube, while it is still under the protective gas environment. The proposed characterization technique based on optical reflection requires only milligrams of sample and helps to eliminate the common problem of oxidation associated with removal and transport of the freshly fabricated nanostructures into an inert protective environment. This optical technique could be applied to any hydrogen storage material in powder form which shows a significant difference in its optical absorption between the hydride and the non-hydride phase. A three-color, 8 -bit, 240 × 320 pixel imager was used to acquire the optical signals, and the image processing was peformed in MATLAB®. Magnesium films of various thicknesses were fabricated by pulsed laser deposition and capped with a palladium protective layer. The change in the kinetics as a function of film thickness was measured. Raman spectroscopy on the 11 nm magnesium hydride film reveals a small but detectable peak arising from the Eg phonon mode. The Raman frequencies of bulk magnesium hydride predicted by CASTEP calculations are included for comparison. We propose and demonstrate a multi-stacked structure intended for low-nanometer ultrathin films of various metal hydrides, which would enable them to simultaneously achieve an enhanced optical contrast equivalent to that of thicker films, yet be able to retain much of the rapid switching kinetics characteristic of low-nanometer ultrathin films. Such improvement in the performance will help to further extend the scope of applications, particularly in the area of dynamic switchable mirrors, where switching speed and high switching contrast are crucial. Future work will also be based on resonant photodesorption of hydrogen, as well as surface plasmon nanophotonics, both of which are aimed at improving the efficiency of hydrogen desorption of promising hydrides such as MgH 2 or LiBH 4...|$|R
