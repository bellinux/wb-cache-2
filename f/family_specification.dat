40|$|We analyse the {{inherent}} performance of parallel software. For this end {{we use a}} task graph to model software structure, and apply measures of performance based on the graph?s execution time, given enough processors. The task graph consists of tasks and precedence constraints between tasks: we show that performance cannot be improved by adding constraints to a task graph. Using this we derive known bounds on performance in a systematic manner by comparing {{the structure of a}} program to benchmark structures for which performance can be easily determined. Further, we simplify these bounds to highlight the importance of some summary parameters of the precedence structure. To conclude we examine an existing model of families of programs. We find bounds on performance within a family and simplify them by restricting the <b>family</b> <b>specification.</b> These bounds yield interesting insights into the scaled performance model of Gustafson, which models the effect of increasing the number of processors in tandem with program size...|$|E

40|$|The Family as an Externality {{within a}} Market Economy: Evidence from the Czech Republic Abstract The {{dissertation}} thesis deals with {{an issue of}} fertility decline in developed countries from a perspective of relationship between {{the family and the}} market economy. The family is perceived as an externality with respect to theoretical economic framework as well as to real economy of the Czech Republic in the period of economic transition. In other words, neither theory nor applied policy fully reflects contribution of the family for the whole society. The thesis goes into the <b>family</b> <b>specification</b> from distinct standpoints, its development within time, relationship to economy and briefly introduces economic approaches to the family at both micro and macro level. In addition, the thesis carries out analyses of Czech data in the period 1989 - 2010. While the macro analysis is focused on interaction between fertility and economy performance, the micro analysis is devoted to financial support provided by state to the family via the social scheme and the tax system. Keywords: the family, fertility, economy, the Czech Republic, the social scheme, the tax syste...|$|E
40|$|A {{system model}} [...] -namely a formal {{definition}} of the coordination of people, hardware devices, and software components performing activities, using resources and artifacts, and producing various outputs [...] -can aid understanding of the real-world system it models. Complex real-world systems, however, exhibit considerable amounts of variation that can be difficult or impossible to represent within a single model. This dissertation evaluates {{the hypothesis that the}} careful characterization and representation of system variation can aid in the generation and analysis of concrete system instances related to one another in specified ways and manifesting different kinds of variation. When a set of closely related systems can be characterized by a compelling set-membership criterion, it is often useful and appropriate to characterize the set as a family of systems. In this dissertation, a variety of system variation requirements and corresponding needs for <b>family</b> <b>specification</b> criteria are identified. We focus on two specific kinds of variation, namely functional and agent variation, and suggest an approach for meeting these needs both at the level of requirements specification (problem-level variation), {{as well as at the}} level of implementation specification (solution-level variation). We present a framework for generating and analyzing new system instances, using the Little-JIL process definition language as an experimental vehicle to study what process definition language capabilities are necessary to support the explicit modeling of variation at the solution level, and thereby to address needs at the problem level. We define a formal notation for specifying functional and agent variation in human-intensive processes and describe a prototype system to accommodate this specification within an existing modeling framework. Once a family of systems is formally defined and characterized at the solution level, different analysis techniques can be applied to make assurances that all members of the family share certain kinds of properties. These analysis results can then be used to inform variation needs at the problem level. To evaluate the applicability of the approach, we study and model the variation observed in two real-world, human-intensive systems from the domains of conflict resolution and elections. Both case study domains have been observed to employ functional variants of their processes, and, given their complex coordination of human and software agents, both domains require agent variation, therefore fostering a fruitful application of our approach...|$|E

In this paper, we propose a model-based configuration approach that provides automation support for reducing configuration effort and the likelihood of configuration errors in the ICS domain.

We evaluate the effectiveness of our configuration approach by applying it to a real subsea oil production system. Specifically, we have rebuilt a number of existing verified product configurations of our industry partner.
