50|$|The Lightning's rig is simple, but offers {{sophisticated}} sail shape controls. The hull {{features a}} <b>hard</b> <b>chine</b> design that combines the stability that provides sail-carrying power, with flat bottom sections that promote planing. The Lightning's <b>hard</b> <b>chine</b> and 130 lb centerboard {{give her the}} stability and power of a small keel boat going to weather in strong winds and allow her to carry a very large spinnaker for breathtaking offwind rides.|$|E
50|$|From 1933 Scott-Paine {{designed}} and built <b>hard</b> <b>chine</b> motor torpedo boats, and MA/SB anti-submarine boats, from 1935 having them accepted by the Admiralty.|$|E
25|$|Chined and Hard-chined. Examples are the {{flat-bottom}} (chined), v-bottom, and multi-bottom hull (<b>hard</b> <b>chined).</b> These types have {{at least}} one pronounced knuckle throughout all or most of their length.|$|R
5000|$|The Impulse {{has much}} <b>harder</b> <b>chines</b> than the Laser, {{which gives the}} Impulse a gently V keeled and flatter wetted surface than the rounded Laser hull. This hull shape gives the Impulse more heeling {{stability}} on the water than the Laser making it more stable in rough and windy conditions.|$|R
50|$|He was a {{well-known}} designer of sailing boats of all sizes, including the Cherub, Javelin (NZ), Firebug and Flying Ant classes of sailing dinghies. His designs used thin plywood, <b>hard</b> <b>chines,</b> a vertical stem and stern and light displacement. The minimum weight for a Cherub hull was 50 kg and a Firebug is 40 kg.|$|R
50|$|A chine in boating {{refers to}} a sharp change in angle in the cross section of a hull. A hull without chines has a {{gradually}} curving cross section. The term <b>hard</b> <b>chine</b> indicates an angle with little rounding, where a soft chine would be more rounded, but still involve the meeting of distinct planes. Chine log construction is a method of building <b>hard</b> <b>chine</b> boat hulls. Hard chines are common in plywood hulls, while soft chines are often found on fiberglass hulls.|$|E

5000|$|In {{seaplane}} design, a <b>hard</b> <b>chine</b> [...] is {{the longitudinal}} line of sharp change in hull cross-section, meeting of bottom plane with lateral panel, {{as in the}} hull of a powered planing boat.|$|E
5000|$|The first hulls {{to start}} {{incorporating}} <b>hard</b> <b>chines</b> were probably shallow draft cargo carrying vessels used on rivers and in canals. The barge {{and later the}} scow used a flat bottom and near vertical sides, which provided the maximum cargo carrying capacity (in both space and displacement) available for a given depth of water.|$|R
5000|$|Four Trimotors {{were ordered}} by the Marine française. When the first was tested the Navy complained that {{alighting}} contact was very hard and so Latham revised the planing surface, giving it <b>harder</b> <b>chine</b> (a steeper V) and used this on the other three Naval Trimotors, giving then gentle landing characteristics. They could carry four [...] "large" [...] bombs".|$|R
5000|$|The boat's {{hull and}} {{superstructure}} are constructed entirely from 5456 marine grade aluminum. Designed with a <b>hard</b> <b>chined</b> deep [...] "V" [...] planing hull, the 47' MLB exceeds its hull speed. The frame {{is composed of}} 17 vertical bulkhead frames, {{each of which is}} welded to the deck and hull, and five of which are watertight.|$|R

50|$|Working in {{the same}} inland waters as the sailing scows was the later river steamboat. River steamboats were often built using the same hard chined {{construction}} methods of the sailing scows, with a flat bottom, <b>hard</b> <b>chine,</b> and nearly vertical sides.|$|E
5000|$|Chine - The {{portion of}} the boat where the hull and deck meet. A soft chine refers to the angle that the deck and hull make when they meet, maximally 180 degrees. A <b>hard</b> <b>chine</b> refers to a more acute acute angle, {{approaching}} and angle of zero degrees.|$|E
50|$|They were {{designed}} by Stanley Butler {{after the turn of}} the 19th century and were modeled after the flat-bottomed skiffs used in the oyster and commercial clam trade. Those boats were built with <b>hard</b> <b>chines</b> and low gunwales to provide a stable platform from which to clam from. The design was altered many times until 1926 when the design was standardized.|$|R
50|$|Sharpies are {{a type of}} <b>hard</b> <b>chined</b> {{sailboat}} with a flat bottom, extremely shallow draft, centreboards and straight, flaring sides. They {{are believed}} to have originated in the New Haven, Connecticut region of Long Island Sound, United States. They were traditional fishing boats used for oystering, and later appeared in other areas. With centerboards and shallow balanced rudders they are well suited to sailing in shallow tidal waters.|$|R
50|$|Although his designs ranged {{through the}} full {{spectrum}} of boat types, Bolger tended to favor simplicity over complexity. Many of his hulls are made from sheet materials — typically plywood — and have <b>hard</b> <b>chines.</b> A subclass of these designed in association with Harold Payson called Instant Boats were so named because they were intended to be easily built by amateurs out of commonly available materials. Bolger also advocated the use of traditional sailing rigs and leeboards.|$|R
50|$|The Force 5 {{is a small}} one-design racing {{sailboat}} that {{is similar}} to the more well known Laser but with a <b>hard</b> <b>chine</b> aft. Although it is designed for single-handed racing, two people can easily fit into the large cockpit. The boats are currently built in Long Island, New York by Weeks Yacht Yard.|$|E
50|$|The two chine hull (B), with a {{flat bottom}} and nearly {{vertical}} sides, was the first <b>hard</b> <b>chine</b> design to achieve widespread use. This design provides far more stability than the single chine hull, with minimum draft and a large cargo capacity. These characteristics make the two chine hull popular for punts, barges, and scows.|$|E
5000|$|The three chine hull (C) is {{probably}} the most common <b>hard</b> <b>chine</b> hull. Having a shallow [...] "V" [...] in the bottom and near-vertical panels above that, it approximates the shape of traditional rounded hull boats fairly well. This hull is common, even in fiberglass designs where employing chines offers no advantage in construction.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Chined</b> and <b>hard</b> <b>chined</b> hulls - These are hulls {{made up of}} flat panels (commonly made of plywood, or more {{traditionally}} with planking) which meet at a {{sharp angle}} known as the chine. Chined hulls range from simple flat-bottomed boats where the topsides and bottom meet at about 110 degrees (such as banks dories and sharpies) to skiffs where the bottom is arced rather than flat. Multi-chine plywood hulls allow a round hull shape to be approximated.|$|R
50|$|The Dabchick is a South African youth {{sailing dinghy}} {{that is usually}} raced single-handed. A Bermuda rigged boat, it has a {{mainsail}} and jib. Its hull is very shallow and its skipper sits on its flat deck. This <b>hard</b> <b>chined</b> scow was designed by Jack Köper in 1955. Since they were published in 1956, nearly 3,500 plans have been issued to builders, and 4,000 boats have been built. It is usually sailed by teenagers after moving {{up and out of}} the Optimist, before moving into adult classes.|$|R
50|$|The Heron has a Portsmouth Yardstick of 1346 when sailed single handed. In the US Sailing scheme {{it has a}} D-PN of 120.0.The Heron {{has been}} a popular {{entry-level}} sailing dinghy, due largely to its high level of stability. The craft design features <b>hard</b> <b>chines.</b> These are sharp angles between the sides {{and bottom of the}} hull, giving it great stability even in rough weather conditions. This makes it easier for a relative novice to avoid capsizing. A round-hulled craft requires a lot more skill to keep upright.|$|R
50|$|In 1957 {{the company}} {{expanded}} the 19-foot model to 20 feet and installed a larger, 100-horsepower engine. Customers found, however, that the lapstrake hull did not withstand the higher speeds well, so in 1961 the design {{was changed to}} a seam and batten construction with a <b>hard</b> <b>chine.</b> This new style continued in production until 1968.|$|E
5000|$|A low set cabin {{contained}} the wheel-house, chart {{room and a}} sickbay. For defence against enemy aircraft, {{on top of the}} cabin were two aircraft-style turrets made by Armstrong-Whitworth initially with a single [...]303 in Vickers machine gun or Lewis gun (this was later improved - see Variants below). The mahogany hull was of the <b>hard</b> <b>chine,</b> planing type.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "sampan" [...] {{comes from}} the {{original}} Cantonese term for the boats, 三板 (sam pan), literally meaning [...] "three planks". The name referred to the hull design, which consists of a flat bottom (made from one plank) joined to two sides (the other two planks). The design closely resembles Western <b>hard</b> <b>chine</b> boats like the scow or punt.|$|E

50|$|Commercial {{fiberglass}} hulls are molded, {{and since}} the fiberglass and resin used have no inherent shapes, the mold can be of just about any shape. The fibre glass is fired into the mold with a gun, normally using chop mat strands in epoxy. It is important to control the atmosphere to keep humidity low during this operation otherwise moisture may be trapped in the fibreglass that will eventually blister and cause fibreglass pox. Molds for low production power boats are often made of plywood, and so {{the properties of the}} plywood often result in a <b>chined</b> hull. <b>Hard</b> <b>chines</b> may be rounded off by the addition of filler to the mold to create a fillet; this creates the soft chines often found on fiberglass boats.The outside of a mold is supported by a steel lattice work to ensure rigidity.|$|R
50|$|The Thunderbird's {{exceptional}} {{performance can}} be attributed to a lightweight, 3,650 lb (1,656 kg) hull and rig with V-bottom hull and <b>hard</b> <b>chines.</b> Outstanding stability is provided by a 1,530 lb (694 kg) cast iron keel of advanced design with a 4.79-foot (1.46 m) draft. The sail area is 363 square feet (33.72 square meters) in the mainsail and genoa, and racing boats are equipped with a spinnaker. The Thunderbird (or T-Bird, as it is commonly known) has proven to be fast in both light winds and heavy, often out-performing contemporary displacement-type sailboats of similar or even larger size in local handicap races. By way of comparison, where the PHRF handicap for the Thunderbird is 201-204 (seconds per mile), the J/24 rates 185, the San Juan 24 228-237, the Ericson 26 234, the MacGregor 26 259, the Catalina 27 204.|$|R
50|$|Farr began {{building}} boats at 13 near Warkworth north of Auckland. His first boats were plywood <b>hard</b> <b>chine</b> Moth class designs. He later {{designed and built}} variants of Cherubs and especially Flying 18s. His early designs were built in plywood with focus on light weight with good planing shapes. By his late teens he was designing small lightweight keel boats that were successful on the race course.|$|E
50|$|On 3 August 1931 {{the factory}} burnt to the ground, but was rapidly rebuilt {{as the most}} modern and {{efficient}} boatyard in Britain. Motor Torpedo Boats with a <b>hard</b> <b>chine</b> were designed, built, and increasingly sold to the British Admiralty. Armoured target boats were also built for the RAF, proving very successful and cost-effective, together with tenders for Imperial Airways flying boats, and admiral's barges.|$|E
50|$|The Super Sunfish was {{available}} from 1974 to 1984. AMF marketed this more conventional sail plan as a performance {{version of the}} Sunfish {{in an attempt to}} compete with, among others, the newly emerging Laser. Portsmouth handicap numbers, however, place the Laser slightly faster. With its <b>hard</b> <b>chine</b> hull, the Super Sunfish is the more stable boat so it's a tradeoff between the two designs.|$|E
2500|$|A chined hull {{consists}} of straight, smooth, tall, long, or short plates, timbers or sheets of ply, which are set {{at an angle}} to each other when viewed in transverse section. The traditional chined hull is a simple hull shape because it works with only straight planks bent into a curve. These boards are often bent lengthwise. Plywood chined boats made of 8'x4' sheets have most bend along the long axis of the sheet. Only thin ply 3–6mm can easily be shaped into a compound bend. Most home-made constructed boats are chined hull boats. Mass-produced chine powerboats are usually made of sprayed chop strand fibreglass over a wooden mold. The Cajun [...] "pirogue" [...] {{is an example of a}} craft with <b>hard</b> <b>chines.</b> Benefits of this type of hull is the low production cost and the (usually) fairly flat bottom, making the boat faster at planing. Sail boats with chined hull make use of a dagger board or keel.|$|R
5000|$|The current International Moth is {{a result}} of merging two {{separate}} but similar historical developments. The first occurred in Australia in 1928 when Len Morris built a cat rigged (single sail) flat bottomed scow (horizontal bow rather than the [...] "normal" [...] vertical bow) to sail on Andersons' Inlet at Inverloch, a seaside resort 130 km from Melbourne. The scow was <b>hard</b> <b>chined,</b> 11 ft long, with a single 80 sq ft mainsail. The craft was named [...] "Olive" [...] after his wife. The construction was timber with an internal construction somewhat like Hargreave's box kite. [...] "Olive's" [...] performance was so outstanding, that a similar boat [...] "Whoopee" [...] was built. Len Morris then sold [...] "Olive", and built another boat called [...] "Flutterby", and with those three boats, the Inverloch Yacht Club was formed. Restrictions for the class known as the Inverloch Eleven Footer class were then drawn up, with the distinguishing characteristic that of being not a one-design boat but rather that of a boat permitting development within the set of design parameters.|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} experimental {{program has}} been carried out to estimate roll damping parameters for three models of fishing vessels having different hull shapes and moving with forward speed. Roll damping parameters are determined using a novel method. This method combines the Energy method and the Modulating Function technique. The results show that this method gets better estimates compared with the original Energy method. [...] A data processing system was designed to process the experimental data. A parameter Cerror was introduced to measure the error in roll damping identification. A database system was developed using VAX-Pascal to store the analytical results and perform various kinds of analyses. The data management and processing system in this research work has proved to be very efficient. [...] The effect of forward speed, initial angle and natural frequency on roll damping is discussed. The effect of forward speed on roll damping was found to be nonlinear. The effect of initial angle is strong at zero and low forward speeds and decreases as the forward speed is increased. The effect of natural frequency was found to be weak. [...] Ikeda's method was used to predict the roll damping coefficient. The results were compared with the experimental data. It was found that Ikeda's method overestimates the roll damping at higher forward speeds for all three models. This method fails in predicting the eddy damping for ship forms with <b>hard</b> <b>chines.</b> It was noticed that as models move with forward speed, their mean drafts increase. A modification to Ikeda's formula is proposed, making use of this observation. The values predicted by the modified formula fit the experimental data very well. [...] A preliminary experiment has been done to investigate the effect of following waves on roll damping. It has been found that estimating roll damping parameters, without allowing for the time variation in the restoring moment, results in overestimating the values of these parameters. Further work is needed in this area...|$|R
