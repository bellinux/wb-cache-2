40|$|A {{comprehensive}} historiography of {{the agricultural}} development in continental Europe, from the medieval period until the XX century, does not exist. Indisputably, modern agriculture is essentially {{an outgrowth of the}} humid temperate regions bordering the English Channel, but English, French and German scholars were wrong to identify these regions as the only cradle of the modern agricultural revolution. The historiography of agronomic technologies can easily underscore the importance of the Po Valley in this process because of the leading role of water {{in the development of a}} more sophisticated agriculture. In fact, drawing a connection between the grain and <b>forage</b> <b>farming,</b> which had renewed Flemish and English agriculture (but also being blessed with a warmer climate capable of exploiting the potential of the first capillary irrigation system), in the successive decades of the first Millennium, Lombard agriculture realized an amount of production that was unimaginable in Flanders, Picardy, Normandy, Holstein and Jutland, thanks to the connection between grain farming and dairy production. After having reached exceptional levels of productivity as well as predating the agricultures of the same historical period, the agriculture of the Po Valley region settled into a premature twilight. In fact, whilst a more scientific agriculture was being born in England and France, the Italian countryside returned to a past situation with medieval characteristics. Only in XVIII century, in the Lombard countryside it was rediscovered, under the Austrian-Hungarian domination, the old prosperity founded, above all, upon traditional methods. These traditional ways were most distant from the scientific applications that were assuming the role of the “engine of progress” in other European cultivations. The agriculture of Lombardy joined this “engine of progress” only after the mid XIX century...|$|E

40|$|An {{optimisation}} model {{was developed to}} compare the profitability of different forage species on irrigated dairy farms. The model {{is driven by the}} energy and protein requirements of the milking cow. The objective of the model is to maximise income, after herd and feed costs, by selecting the area of the farm sown to particular forage species. Different forage species may require different animal production systems to optimise their profitability. In order to achieve this, the model can alter the herd size and structure, level of production, concentrate feeding regime and forage conservation and feeding on a monthly basis.

40|$|Human Behavioral Ecology (HBE) {{has been}} used {{for more than two decades}} to examine {{hunter-gatherer}} societies. Kennett and Winterhalder’s edited volume takes HBE in new directions, applying well-known concepts and models to the transition from <b>foraging</b> to <b>farming.</b> While many edited volumes lack focus, this one is a well-written and cohesive document. Winterhalder and Kennett’s introductory chapter provides a clear summary of HBE literature and a review of common concepts. This makes individual case studies approachable even to HBE newcomers. The book is not sectioned, but the case studies in Chapters 2 to 12 can be divided based on subject matter. Chapters 2 through 6 (by Tucker, Gremillion, Diehl and Waters, Barlow, and Kennett et al.) constitute one of the most important and substantive discussions in the book. Tucker writes from an ethnographic perspective, while the others examine largely archaeological cases. All five chapters conclude that a mixed foraging-farming economy is often stable for long periods of time. This conclusion is particularly compelling in archaeological circles, as it suggests that the “transition” phase between <b>foraging</b> and <b>farming</b> may actually have been an adaptive mechanism in its own right. Thus, the period spanning any shift from <b>foraging</b> to <b>farming</b> should be examined based on local ecology and historical trajectories, rather than envisioned as a short-term shift between two more successful subsistence strategies. This conclusion may affect the way many archaeologists and anthropologists form research questions about the “transition” between <b>foraging</b> and <b>farming,</b> minimizing problems of oversimplification that have occurred in past discussions of “the Neolithic Revolution”...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{in order to}} examine whether any connection existed between the amounts of iron in forage and the sporadic occurrence of scrapie observed in certain parts of Iceland. As iron and manganese are considered antagonistic in plants, calculation of the Fe/Mn ratios was also included by using results from Mn determination earlier performed in the same samples. Forage samples (n = 170) from the summer harvests of 2001 – 2003, were collected from 47 farms for iron and manganese analysis. The farms were divided into four categories: 1. Scrapie-free farms in scrapie-free areas (n = 9); 2. Scrapie-free farms in scrapie-afflicted areas (n = 17); 3. Scrapie-prone farms (earlier scrapie-afflicted, restocked farms) (n = 12); 4. Scrapie-afflicted farms (n = 9). Farms in categories 1 and 2 are collectively referred to as scrapie-free farms. The mean iron concentration in forage samples from scrapie-afflicted farms was significantly higher than in <b>forage</b> samples from <b>farms</b> in the other scrapie categories (P = 0. 001). The mean Fe/Mn ratio in <b>forage</b> from scrapie-afflicted <b>farms</b> was significantly higher than in forage from scrapie-free and scrapie-prone farms (P < 0. 001). The results indicated relative dominance of iron over manganese in <b>forage</b> from scrapie-afflicted <b>farms</b> as compared to farms in the other categories. Thus thorough knowledge of iron, along with manganese, in soil and vegetation on sheep farms could be a pivot in studies on sporadic scrapie. </p...|$|R
25|$|The Kintampo site is {{most often}} studied by archaeologists who are {{interested}} in seeing how people made the change between foraging and horticulture and agriculture as a way of producing food. Kintampo is seen as an example of neither <b>foraging</b> or <b>farming,</b> but somewhere in between. As practitioners of sedentism, derived from the word sedentary, the people of Kintampo spent more time in their villages and less time wandering around, hunting and gathering food. They took advantage of plants that were native to the area, and although technically they were not farming, they did influence the evolution of plants, effectively being some of the first to domesticate plants in Africa.|$|R

40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{describe}} the management and productivity of this group of smallholder dairy farmers in Kenya {{at the beginning of}} an intervention program and to document relevant observed changes in the 3 rd year of the intervention. A 3 -year intervention program, focused on management of animal health and nutrition, and milk quality, was implemented by one Kenyan and two Canadian non-governmental organizations (one university based) to help improve the milk production and livelihoods of Kenyan smallholder dairy farmers (primarily women). Thirty farmers were enrolled and completed questionnaires at the start and end of the project. Focus groups were also conducted to obtain qualitative information on livelihood effects from the program. In 2004, 70 % of the eligible youngstock (more than 15 months of age) were pregnant, and cows had a long average days-in-milk of 240 days. External parasites, poor hygiene, and long claws were not uncommon among cows, and 37 % and 20 % of the farms reported clinical intestinal parasitism and diarrhea in youngstock. In 2006, there were significant improvements in the proportion of <b>farms</b> planting high-protein <b>forages,</b> <b>farms</b> using better milking procedures, and on-farm milk storage methods. The reported mastitis incidence rate fell from 0. 55 to 0. 20 cases/cow-year (p< 0. 01), and the average number of cows and youngstock significantly increased from 1. 5 and 0. 9 to 2. 9 and 2. 6, respectively.
