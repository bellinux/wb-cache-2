The processes we consider are 2 → 1 and 2 → 2 hadronic reactions involving Higgs and vector bosons in the final state. All possible leptonic decay channels of the vector bosons are included {{for the first time}} in the calculations, by consistently accounting for all resonant and non-resonant diagrams, off-shell effects and spin correlations. We briefly introduce the theoretical <b>framework</b> <b>MATRIX</b> is based on, discuss its relevant features and provide a detailed description of how to use MATRIX to obtain NNLO accurate results for the various processes. We report reference predictions for inclusive and fiducial cross sections of all the physics processes considered here and discuss their corresponding uncertainties. MATRIX features an automatic extrapolation procedure that allows us, for the first time, to control the systematic uncertainties inherent to the applied NNLO subtraction procedure down to the few permille level (or better).

40|$|Many cities, {{including}} some in New Zealand, are investigating, developing or implementing urban form strategies and, separately, Park and Ride systems. These two matters are not generally considered alongside one another. This paper explores {{the relationship and}} interactions between urban form and Park and Ride systems through the identification of objectives for each, and considering {{the degree to which}} objectives of various urban form types may be achieved with different types of Park and Ride systems. The purpose of this research project is to investigate and develop a predictive methodology that would allow the identification of the most suitable Park and Ride system (from a proposed classification scheme) for a given set of urban form objectives. Classification systems for urban form and Park and Ride systems are proposed in light of information from an extensive literature and information review. They are used as a basis for an Assessment <b>Framework</b> <b>Matrix</b> of urban form type against Park and Ride type. The matrix is populated from a spreadsheet-based analysis process, which considers the degree of achievement of urban form objectives by various Park and Ride categories. This process is hampered by the lack of (easily accessible) data, particularly for strategic assessment of existing Park and Ride systems worldwide. A range of tests are conducted on the proposed Assessment <b>Framework</b> <b>Matrix</b> using real cities, a range of hypothetical urban areas, and several sensitivity tests. Subsequently, a case study applies the matrix to Christchurch, New Zealand. The main findings of this research project indicate that the proposed methodology works, needs refining with better data, could be useable in public or stakeholder engagement processes, and would benefit from a "User Manual" and some simplification. The case study tentatively indicates a recommended Park and Ride system type for Christchurch...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} the Interval-valued Matrix Factorization (IMF) <b>framework.</b> <b>Matrix</b> Factorization (MF) is a {{fundamental}} building block of data mining. MF techniques, such as Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF), are widely used in applications of data mining. For example, NMF has shown its advantage in Face Analysis (FA) while PMF has been successfully applied to Collaborative Filtering (CF). In this paper, we analyze the data approximation in FA as well as CF applications and construct interval-valued matrices to capture these approximation phenomenons. We adapt basic NMF and PMF models to the interval-valued matrices and propose Interval-valued NMF (I-NMF) as well as Interval-valued PMF (I-PMF). We conduct extensive experiments to show that proposed I-NMF and I-PMF significantly outperform their single-valued counterparts in FA and CF applications.

However, the complex interactions of habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, habitat condition {{and land use}} have confounded attempts to disentangle {{the relative importance of}} properties of the landscape mosaic, including the matrix. To this end, we controlled for the amount of remnant forest habitat and the level of fragmentation to examine mammal species richness in human-modified landscapes of varying levels of matrix development intensity and patch attributes. We postulated seven alternative models of various patch habitat, landscape and matrix influences on mammal species richness and then tested these models using generalized linear mixed-effects models within an information theoretic <b>framework.</b> <b>Matrix</b> attributes were the most important determinants of terrestrial mammal species richness; matrix development intensity had a strong negative effect and vegetation structural complexity of the matrix had a strong positive effect. Distance to the nearest remnant forest habitat was relatively unimportant. Matrix habitat attributes are potentially a more important indicator of isolation of remnant forest patches than measures of distance to the nearest patch. We conclude that a structurally complex matrix within a human-modified landscape can provide supplementary habitat resources and increase the probability of movement across the landscape, thereby increasing mammal species richness in modified landscapes...|$|E

While numerical models that solve both surface and subsurface flow equations {{in a single}} <b>framework</b> (<b>matrix)</b> are increasingly being applied, computational limitations have restricted their use to local and regional studies. Regional or watershed-scale simulations have been effective tools for understanding hydrologic processes; however, {{there are still many}} questions, such as the adaptation of water resources to anthropogenic stressors and climate variability, that can only be answered across large spatial extents at high resolution. In response to this grand challenge in hydrology, we present the results of a parallel, integrated hydrologic model simulating surface and subsurface flow at high spatial resolution (1 km) over much of continental North America (~ 6. 3 M km 2). These simulations provide integrated predictions of hydrologic states and fluxes, namely, water table depth and streamflow, at very large scale and high resolution. The physics-based modeling approach used here requires limited parameterizations and relies only on more fundamental inputs such as topography, hydrogeologic properties and climate forcing. Results are compared to observations and provide mechanistic insight into hydrologic process interaction.

Although great efforts through the Hadoop implementation and framework decoupling (e. g.

This paper aims to address the YARN scaling issues through a distributed task execution <b>framework,</b> <b>MATRIX,</b> which was originally designed to schedule the executions of data-intensive scientific applications of many-task computing on supercomputers. We propose to leverage the distributed design wisdoms of MATRIX to schedule arbitrary data processing applications in cloud. We compare MATRIX with YARN in processing typical Hadoop workloads, such as WordCount, TeraSort, Grep and RandomWriter, and the Ligand application in Bioinformatics on the Amazon Cloud. Experimental results show that MATRIX outperforms YARN by 1. 27 X for the typical workloads, and by 2. 04 X for the real application. We also run and simulate MATRIX with fine-grained sub-second workloads. With the simulation results giving the efficiency of 86. 8 % at 64 K cores for the 150 ms workload, we show that MATRIX has the potential to enable Hadoop to scale to extreme-scale data centers for fine-grained workloads.
