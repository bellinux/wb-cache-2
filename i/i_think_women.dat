25|$|In {{the whole}} of the ten years I have been working on radio and television, I have been working to a {{majority}} of women. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>women</b> prefer men to be well-mannered, so I always try to watch my manners. They like men to be well dressed, so I do my best to observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact that I sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, I try to watch my grammar – {{but at the same time}} I bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.|$|E
2500|$|... "Male {{characters}} {{are easier to}} write. They're simpler. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>women</b> are generally more psychologically complicated. You {{have to put a}} little more effort into writing a woman." [...] – Jay Presson Allen.|$|E

Then {{when his}} wife had gone: [...] "I {{make a point of}} the {{children}} going to Sunday school, and I like Betty to go to church. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>women</b> ought to be religious. I don't believe myself, but I like women and children to." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm {{a married}} man. And my wife won't {{live with me}} for reasons that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> most <b>women</b> would {{consider}} sound.... Or I should have made love to you long ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{you have}} not starved my curiosity altogether," [...] said Clara, smiling, [...] "but have given it a little hope to feed on for the present, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>woman</b> though <b>I</b> am, I can promise all you wish. Seriously, Basil," [...] she continued, [...] "that {{telltale}} locket of yours has so pleasantly brightened some very gloomy thoughts of mine about you, that I can now live happily on expectation, without once mentioning your secret again, till you give me leave to do so." ...|$|R
60|$|A woman's head {{is usually}} over ears in her heart. Man {{seems to have}} been {{designed}} for the superior being of the two; but as things are, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>women</b> are generally better creatures than men. They have, taken universally, weaker appetites and weaker intellects, but they have much stronger affections. A man with a bad heart has been sometimes saved by a strong head; but a corrupt woman is lost for ever.|$|E
60|$|Sweet, {{women make}} it true. There are men who paint pictures, and carve statues, Paul of Verona and the dyer's son, Or their great rival, who, {{by the sea}} at Venice, Has set God's little maid upon the stair, White as her own white lily, and as tall, Or Raphael, whose Madonnas are divine Because they are mothers merely; yet <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>Women</b> are the best artists of the world, For they can take the common lives of men Soiled with the money-getting of our age, And with love make them beautiful.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, after all, you do hope," [...] {{said her}} father. [...] "Lenore, when I was down East, I seen what women were doin'. The bad women are good an' the good women are great. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>women</b> {{have more to}} do with war then men, even if they do stay home. It must be because women are mothers.... Lenore, you've bucked me up. I'll go at things now. The need for wheat next year will be beyond calculation. I'll buy ten {{thousand}} acres of that wheatland round old Chris Dorn's farm. An' my shot at the Germans will be wheat. I'll raise a million bushels!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But she is, very hard. Even then <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> he minds it much. But, Miss Mackenzie, {{that kind}} of {{companion}} would not do for me at all. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> a <b>woman</b> should be soft and soothing, like a dove." ...|$|R
6000|$|Margaret {{leaned down}} and touched him gently. [...] "You keep your rules, and your rules are good. Perhaps it's strange, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> a <b>woman</b> will break {{conventions}} where a man will not. Still, you see, I'm proud----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my {{word you}} have a very {{beautiful}} butler," [...] answered Pendennis, gallantly, [...] "and I don't wonder at the young fellows raving about her. When we were of their age, Captain Costigan, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> plainer <b>women</b> would have done our business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I have. I {{shall never}} care for you again, Mr. Beaton; {{you might as}} well {{understand}} it once for all. Don't think it's anything in yourself, or that I think you unworthy of me. I'm not so self-satisfied as that; I know very well that I'm not a perfect character, and that I've no claim on perfection in anybody else. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>women</b> who want that are fools; they won't get it, and they don't deserve it. But I've learned a good. deal more about myself than I knew in St. Barnaby, and a life of work, of art, and of art alone that's what I've made up my mind to." ...|$|E
6000|$|Those {{will never}} grow old. Fashions in monsters do change, {{but the truth}} of {{humanity}} goes on for ever, unchangeable and inexhaustible in the variety of its disclosures. Whether Turgenev's art, which has captured it with such mastery and such gentleness, is for [...] "all time" [...] it is hard to say. Since, as you say yourself, he brings all his problems and characters to the test of love, we may hope that it will endure at least till the infinite emotions of love are replaced by the exact simplicity of perfected Eugenics. But even by then, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>women</b> would not have changed much; and the women of Turgenev who understood them so tenderly, so reverently and so passionately--they, at least, are certainly for all time.|$|E
60|$|ELLIE [rising and strolling to {{the chair}} to {{contemplate}} their subject]. You need not trouble on that score, Hesione. I have more to give Boss Mangan than he has to give me: it is I who am buying him, and at a pretty good price too, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>Women</b> are better at that sort of bargain than men. I have taken the Boss's measure; and ten Boss Mangans shall not prevent me doing far more as I please as his wife than I have {{ever been able to}} do as a poor girl. [Stooping to the recumbent figure]. Shall they, Boss? I think not. [She passes on to the drawing-table, and leans against the end of it, facing the windows]. I shall not have to spend most of my time wondering how long my gloves will last, anyhow.|$|E
5000|$|French {{actress and}} model, Clémence Poésy, became a W4 Ambassadress in 2014. She {{explains}} why {{she came to}} support W4: “I <b>think</b> <b>women</b> have to care about other women and fight for the ones who can’t. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{it is one of}} the most important fights to lead right now. I work with a web platform called Women’s WorldWide Web, W4, and they do funding for lots of different charities around the world. <b>I</b> also <b>think</b> <b>women</b> are the solution.” ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Go {{without my}} stays? Never" [...] exclaimed {{one of the}} leaders of fashion. [...] "I wouldn't do {{anything}} so untidy. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> a <b>woman</b> without corsets is most unsightly." [...] "You cannot look smart and have a pretty figure without stays. It is impossible." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hendrickson {{weighed in}} on her character's mixed signals. [...] "There's a huge {{question}} mark hanging over her head, isn't there?" [...] she said. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that almost any woman at that age one. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> every <b>woman</b> and every man, at some point at their life... It's only natural to think twice about your sexual orientation." ...|$|R
6000|$|The prince’s countenance wore an {{expression}} {{by no means}} pleasant; when looking towards the little company assembled, and waiting for him, {{he did not see}} Beatrix’s bright face there as usual to greet him. He asked Lady Esmond for his fair introducer of yesterday: her ladyship only cast her eyes down, and said quietly, Beatrix could not be of the supper that night; nor did she show the least sign of confusion, whereas Castlewood turned red, and Esmond was no less embarrassed. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>women</b> have an instinct of dissimulation; they know by nature how to disguise their emotions far better than the most consummate male courtiers can do. Is not {{the better part of the}} life of many of them spent in hiding their feelings, in cajoling their tyrants, in masking over with fond smiles and artful gaiety their doubt, or their grief, or their terror? ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Gage {{was getting}} a dress for the hop, and {{it was to be}} {{finished}} that day. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>women</b> really like the scare of thinking their dresses will not be done for a given occasion, and so arrange to have them at the last moment. Mrs. March went with the girl early in the afternoon to have it tried on for the last time, and they came home reporting that it was a poem. My wife confided to me that it was not half done--merely begun, in fact--and would never be finished in time in the world. She also assured Miss Gage that she need not be the least uneasy; that there was not an hour's work on the dress; and that the dress-maker's reputation was at stake, and she would not dare to fail her. I knew she was perfectly sincere in both these declarations, which were, indeed, merely the expression of two mental attitudes, and had no relation to the facts.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel just}} like {{studying}} with might and main," [...] she declared as {{she brought her}} books down from the attic. [...] "Oh, you good old friends, I'm glad to see your honest faces once more--yes, even you, geometry. I've had a perfectly beautiful summer, Marilla, and now I'm rejoicing as a strong man to run a race, as Mr. Allan said last Sunday. Doesn't Mr. Allan preach magnificent sermons? Mrs. Lynde says he is improving every day {{and the first thing}} we know some city church will gobble him up and then we'll be left and have to turn to and break in another green preacher. But I don't see the use of meeting trouble halfway, do you, Marilla? I think it would be better just to enjoy Mr. Allan while we have him. If I were a man I think I'd be a minister. They can have such an influence for good, if their theology is sound; and it must be thrilling to preach splendid sermons and stir your hearers' hearts. Why can't women be ministers, Marilla? I asked Mrs. Lynde that and she was shocked and said it would be a scandalous thing. She said there might be female ministers in the States and she believed there was, but thank goodness we hadn't got to that stage in Canada yet and she hoped we never would. But I don't see why. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>women</b> would make splendid ministers. When there is a social to be got up or a church tea or anything else to raise money the women have to turn to and do the work. I'm sure Mrs. Lynde can pray every bit as well as Superintendent Bell and I've no doubt she could preach too with a little practice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you are {{attending}} to my business," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "I am very glad, {{especially now that}} it has reached the boarding-house stage, where <b>I</b> <b>think</b> a <b>woman</b> will {{be better able to}} work than a man. Are you doing this entirely independent of Mr Candy?" ...|$|R
60|$|COLONEL. [Following up his thoughts.] <b>I</b> always <b>think</b> <b>women</b> are wonderful. There's your Aunt, she's very funny, but if there's {{anything}} {{the matter with}} me, she'll sit up all night; but when she's ill herself, {{and you try to}} do anything for her, out she raps at once.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we'll {{have to get}} {{reconciled}} {{to being}} alone, I suppose; we can't expect to keep him always. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's a <b>woman,</b> Mrs. Brown." ...|$|R

5000|$|Carr left Texas Tech {{and went}} on to pastor churches in the South Plains at Cooper, Levelland, and Crosbyton. She said that she {{considered}} herself a [...] "pastor, not a woman pastor[...] [...] [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>women</b> are called in the same sense that men are called to be pastors. I think God regards us as people." ...|$|E
50|$|Pulse is very fresh. This is {{all about}} citrus, {{but it also has}} vanilla in the back. It is {{important}} for me for a fragrance not to just smell like one thing. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>women</b> are interesting and I don't like for you to be like, 'Ok, this smells like this.' I like for it to be something signature and something that brings out your inner beauty and your confidence and makes you feel like you leave a long-lasting impression on someone.|$|E
5000|$|Ian Cohen of Pitchfork Media said [...] "as far as [...] "My bitch bad, lookin' like {{a bag of}} money" [...] (the hook from [...] "Bag of Money", natch) goes, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>women</b> {{like being}} {{compared}} to formless sacks, but Ross really likes money, so a compliment's a compliment".|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't like colors, father, {{and if it}} hadn't {{been for}} mamma I should never have thought of getting these {{expensive}} flowers. <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>women</b> lower themselves by dressing themselves as butterflies. No wonder men consider they think of nothing but dress and have no minds for higher matters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it {{may show}} that"--he defended himself against nothing. [...] "But it shows also, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> that charming <b>women</b> are, {{in the kind}} of life we're leading now, {{numerous}} and formidable." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I play a {{lot with}} the color in this collection," [...] {{explained}} Carolina Herrera. [...] "And the romanticism and the ethereal quality of the evening, which was very much inspired by the Botticelli paintings. You know, all the flounces and all the flowers and very romantic… I am responding to what I have {{in my mind that}} I want to see the women of the Spring 2009 wearing and I think it's very feminine and it's very romantic and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>women</b> like to look that way." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} do really a very {{feminine}} and glamorous collection and young at the same time… The rust and the red mixed with the brown and the black… Colors are fashion and they are universal; {{they have to go}} everywhere. Color is the fun side of fashion. You have to mix the colors in fun way to make them look newer… We have seen very somber collections {{for a long time and}} it needs a little bit of color. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>women</b> are ready to wear color… Romance is important and I think in this collection, there was a game of seduction you could play and not showing so much skin," [...] said Carolina Herrera backstage.|$|E
30|$|At the Border Trade Zones, Vietnamese women’s {{figures are}} everywhere, {{including}} those dalaoban (grand bosses) and kuli (laborers). <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Vietnamese <b>women</b> are tough {{and we are}} diligent and able to chiku (eat bitterness).

60|$|The vivacity of the {{population}} in these parts is very striking, after the gravity and lassitude of Rome; and the air was made cheerful with the talk and laughter of hundreds of voices. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the <b>women</b> are prettier than the Roman maids and matrons, who, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have said before, have chosen to be very uncomely since the rape of their ancestresses, by way of wreaking a terrible spite and revenge.|$|R
