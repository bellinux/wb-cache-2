The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E

John Church, the publican whom Webster had attempted to implicate, was himself a former servant who had risen to lower middle-class status and earned a measure of prosperity and effective management of his pub. His commitment to bettering himself through hard work was in keeping with the ethic of the time. Webster, in contrast, had simply stolen her briefly-held middle-class identity.|$|E
50|$|Evidence is {{the corner}} stone of all legal proceedings. It is therefore, of great significance, for its {{sanctity}} to be protected.

Assigning probative value on the evidence of the disputants and, their witnesses, equally depend on the forensic skills of the trial court in observing the <b>demeanours</b> of those witnesses. The basis for the proscription of offences relating to perjury or false evidence is underscored by the inherent danger in wrongful conviction or wrongful acquittal where the evidence adduced by the parties, were false.|$|R

Mean retention times for the transmitter packages ranged from 44 to 384 days. There was no skin or feather damage to the birds associated with transmitter attachments.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} early {{childhood}} education and care (ECEC) has a legitimate aspiration to be a 'caring profession' like others such as nursing or social work, defined by a moral purpose. For example, practitioners often draw on an ethic of care as evidence of their professionalism. However, the discourse of professionalism in England completely excludes the ethical vocabulary of care. Nevertheless, it necessarily depends on gendered dispositions towards emotional labour, often promoted by training programmes as 'professional' <b>demeanours.</b> Taking control of the professionalisation agenda therefore requires practitioners to demonstrate a critical understanding of their practice as 'emotion work'. At the same time, reconceptualising practice within a political ethic of care may allow the workforce, and new trainees in particular, to champion 'caring' as a sustainable element of professional work, expressed not only in maternal, dyadic key-working but in advocacy for care as a social principle...|$|R

40|$|Many {{observers}} believe {{that men and}} women bring to policing differences in attitude, values and perceptions that influence the way they do their work. Female police officers have been assumed to have greater commitment to public service, more calming and reassuring <b>demeanours,</b> and less violent encounters with citizens (Bell 1982), and others have recently argued (Martin 1991) that the inclusion of women in policing is particularly relevant to the current emphasis on community policing. More directly, Wilson (1991) asserts that not only should there be more women police, but that there also should be room for women's perspectives on what policing ought to be (which assumes that such perspectives already exist among women, if not yet among women police). Gilligan (1977) and others (DuBois et al. 1985) maintain that differing socialization experiences of males and females incline men and women to adopt differing perspectives on justice_for men, predominantly a morality of justice, and for women, predominantly a morality of care. For many, this perspective has become a starting point for much of the debate on criminal justice administration includin...|$|R

40|$|To date, {{experiences}} with technical textiles {{have largely been}} focused on performance related aspects of a fabric developed for specific applications such as sports, health or safety (Shishoo 2005), and methodological problems remain with the techniques employed to measure what is a complex of effect and affect (Bartels 2005, Jordan 2000). However, {{there has been little}} in the way of empirical research into personal human experience with technical fabrics in context, with the notable exception perhaps of Entwistle who examines in depth the kinesthetic properties of particular garments, resulting in heightened awareness of the body (Entwistle & Wilson 2001) and Candy, who analyses feelings of well being and the performance of socially meaningful <b>demeanours</b> (Candy 2007 a, Candy 2007 b). We wish to extend this embodied view of textiles in order to realise the potential of smart and technical fabrics and sensory environments as tools for wellbeing, mental health and personal expression.

40|$|Realisation of industrialised production’s {{impact on}} the natural {{environment}} was emphasised by Rachel Carson during the 1960 s and began an era of environmentalism that sought to challenge {{the nature of the}} Western economic system. More recently, scientific inquiry has substantiated the claims of the environmental movement placing pressure on corporations and community institutions to act. An embedded rationality associated with modernity ensured that scientific reasoning and technical application would transform corporations through ecological modernisation and present a new corporate environmentalism as the elixir for the Western world’s industrial and consumption woes. As a consequence, a growth of substantial techniques and practices including cleaner production, eco-efficiency, design-for-the-environment and industrial ecology on the technical side as well as corporate environmental management on the management side have taken centre stage. Although corporate environmental practices have made significant gains in offsetting their environmental <b>demeanours,</b> a growing consumer populous challenges ecological modernity to deliver a sustainable outcome for future generations. Therefore, this PDW puts the following issues on the agenda: • Does the eco-modernist perspective and present institutional settings deliver the changes necessary for realising a more sustainable development; • The reflexivity of Ecologically Modernist Societies; • The transformation process required to strengthen present environmental approaches; • Facts and fictions in our contemporary understanding of corporate greening; • Case evidence of paradigm shift(s) that have led industry to accept its ethical and social responsibilities; • Shaping business strategy towards a sustainable future...|$|R
40|$|Informants {{who report}} admissions to crime can be {{powerful}} and dangerous {{players in the}} criminal justice system. Some informants, such as jailhouse informants, are considered deceitful, in part because they can receive incentives to report criminal admissions. However, little research has examined the nature of information that informants provide. In particular, no recent published research has examined whether there are valid behavioural cues that distinguish deceptive from truthful informants. In addition, no published study to date has explored whether informants’ reports and <b>demeanours</b> are affected by the incentives that they receive. Participants in this study either did or did not hear a criminal admission and then were interviewed one week later about details of the admission they had allegedly heard. Some participants were offered an incentive to report the criminal admission in a way that appeared accurate and forthcoming. The {{results of this study suggest}} that there may be behavioural cues emitted during the reporting of criminal admissions that distinguish truthful from deceptive informants. However, the direction of differences for some cues may deviate from other types of witnesses to crime. In addition, the findings of this study indicate that being offered an incentive may induce informants to emit cues during the reporting of criminal admissions that make them appear more truthful, regardless of whether or not they are actually telling the truth. The findings of this study raise concerns about whether informants’ honesty should be assessed in the same way as other witnesses, and about potentially negative consequences of offering incentives to informants in exchange for their reports of criminal admissions...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 83 - 87). This {{study is}} an attempt to trace the construction and performance of violent masculinity. In this thesis I argue that a particular form of violent masculine identity emerges from within a hegemonic structure of gender relations. I employ two popular, contemporary novels, Chuck Palahniuk's Fight Club (1997) and Irvine Welsh's Marabou Stork Nightmares (1996), to examine a form of masculinity which is involved in these relations. I explore these novels with the aim of identifying the ways in which their characters engage with those around them in accordance with the system of power which encompasses them. In doing so, I hope to explain the restricting limits placed upon their bodies, and clarify the compulsions which drive their private <b>demeanours</b> and interpersonal behaviour. I argue that these characters perform a model of masculine identity which is founded upon an ideology of naturalised male authority and grounded in the social practice of violent dominance. Marabou Stork Nightmares depicts a male narrator who, in enacting a model of hegemonic masculinity, becomes implicated in the reproduction of hegemonic masculine domination. Fight Club examines the role of this model in restricting its members to structural and physical domination. Each of these novels is concerned with outlining the limitations of performance of masculine gender identity directed through violence. In different ways they convey {{the extent to which a}} hegemonic system of dominance generates decidedly difficult and unhappy experience. Overall, this thesis attempts these novels, and to account for the problematic experiences of their characters...|$|R
40|$|According to Naturalistic principles, human destiny in {{the form}} of blind chance and determinism, entraps the individual, so man is a defenceless {{creature}} unable to escape from the ruthless paws of a stoical universe. In Naturalism; nonetheless, melodrama mirrors a conscious alternative with a peculiar function. A typical American Naturalistic character thus cannot be a subject for social criticism of American society since they are not victims of the ongoing virtual slavery, capitalist system, nor of a ruined milieu, but of their own volition, and more importantly, their character frailty. Through a Postmodern viewpoint, each Naturalistic work can encompass some entropic trends and changes culminating in an entire failure and devastation. Frank Norris in McTeague displays the futile struggles of ordinary men and how they end up brutes. McTeague encompasses intoxication, abuse, violation, and ruthless homicides. Norris’ depictions of the falling individual as a demon represent the entropic dimension of Naturalistic novels. McTeague’s defeat is somewhat his own fault, the result of his own blunders and resolution, not the result of sheer accident. Throughout the novel, each character is a kind of insane quester indicating McTeague’s decadence and, by inference, the decadence of Western civilisation. McTeague seems to designate Norris’ solicitude for a community fabricated by the elements of human negative <b>demeanours</b> and conducts hauling acute symptoms of infectious dehumanisation. The aim {{of this article is to}} illustrate how one specific negative human disposition gradually, like a running fire, can spread everywhere and burn everything in itself. The author applies the concept of entropy metaphorically to describe the individual devolutions that necessarily comprise community entropy in McTeague, a dying universe...|$|R
40|$|Ames, M. (2012). Memory, Identity and a Desire to Dance. Performance Research. 17 (2), 121 - 127 Special Issue: On FootThe author?s {{contribution}} is an autobiographical account that traces {{her relationship with}} her gender identity and dance training. She converses with feminist theoreticians as they provoke her to consider her relationship with dance and her dancing self. Here, theory takes the position of a wandering companion, facilitating a critique of the self, clarifying perception through a feminist lens, and containing reminiscence within a structure that re-configures the personal as political. This autoethnography is a methodological response to the context of gender construction and dance, foregrounding a more fluid relationship with theory than an argument for specific positions. The phenomenological influence is a response to the particularity of self, perception and memory. The foot here is a foot that alights, ventures out and finds its hold in feminist ground. This article uses the different sections of the pointe shoe of the classical ballet dancer as its structuring device. The article is autobiographic and draws on memories of how both dance and gender identity were constructed and practised by the author through the regulatory disciplines and rituals of dance classes, as well as the desire to conform and to escape from the materiality of her body. From early memories of music and language that combined to produce certain qualities of movement and states of awareness, the line of thought proceeds to later struggles with body shape, image, identity and possible <b>demeanours</b> available to the young adult. The article considers the foot, both its encasement in the hardened silk of the pointe shoe, and the bare foot's exposure and contact with the ground of contemporary dance practice. This experiential tale will draw on feminist theory through the lens of a personal conversation between theory and lived experience. The author considers how desiring transcendence from biology and over determined social roles of femininity and appropriate behaviour became a feature of the dancing woman's psychic landscape and remain as negotiable and contested territory.
