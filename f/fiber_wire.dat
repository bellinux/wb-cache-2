50|$|Along {{with the}} other clones, 47 was trained from youth to become a silent assassin. He was {{instructed}} {{in the use of}} firearms, military hardware, unarmed combat, the use of disguises, and the use of more classical tools of assassination like the infamous <b>fiber</b> <b>wire</b> and poisons. During his training in Romania, he was noted for his exceptional marksmanship, as well as for attacking the asylum staff with homemade slingshots, all of which were promptly confiscated. Along with learning how to use the tools of an assassin, 47 was trained to analyze and adapt to his surroundings when planning an assassination, allowing him to see multiple paths for which he could eliminate his targets silently and efficiently. He also shot smiley faces into targets when he was bored. This is one of the only possible examples of 47 being exposed to pop culture, although all of the clones were sufficiently educated about the outside world by using traditional school textbooks.|$|E

5000|$|The {{development}} of Yu-5 torpedo begun {{around the same}} time of Yu-4 torpedo in the early 1970s, but due to the backward of the Chinese technological and industrial base, the initial tests of wire guidance was carried out by using steel wire instead of copper wire, just like when it was done {{more than a decade ago}} in the late 1950s. The propulsion {{development of}} Yu-5 torpedo benefited greatly from the US Mark 46 torpedo recovered by the Chinese fishermen for the Otto fuel II research and then some technological supports for license production of Mk 46 Mod. 2 torpedo in China of the 1985 deal signed between two countries. Other unconfirmed reports have claimed that during the development of Yu-5 torpedo, advanced American and Japanese commercial off-the-shelf technologies at the time were used, and incorporating these advanced commercial technologies was part of the reason of the prolonged development, which lasted almost two decades. In fact, Yu-5 torpedo program started {{around the same time}} with Yu-4 torpedo program but the latter was completed earlier. Another reason for the prolonged development was the Yu-5 was used as a test vehicle for newer technologies for later torpedoes such as the Yu-6 torpedo, for example, optical <b>fiber</b> <b>wire</b> guidance had been tested on Yu-5 torpedo since 1986 (However, although the tests were considered somewhat satisfactory, it was not adopted for Yu-5 torpedo, which used the traditional copper wire). The Yu-5 torpedo was finally accepted into the service in 1989 and the series production begun the next year in 1990. [...] The torpedo is initially guided by wire guidance for most of the time, and at the final stage, the guidance is changed to active / passive acoustic homing guidance,and the active / passive acoustic homing guidance would also automatically activates when the wire is accidentally severed before the final stage. Yu-5 is the first domestic Chinese ASW torpedo for conventionally powered submarines.|$|E
40|$|A {{case study}} has been {{conducted}} {{in order to improve}} concrete quality in Bangladesh, using fiber reinforcing techniques with locally available low-cost Galvanized Iron (GI) <b>wire</b> <b>fibers.</b> GI <b>wire</b> is in fact mild steel wire with a thin coating of zinc. In order to assess the suitability of GI <b>wire</b> <b>fibers</b> as an alternative to steel fibers, various properties of GI <b>wire</b> <b>fibers</b> i. e. tensile strength, bending capacity etc. have been investigated and compared with the properties of steel fibers in light of relevant ACI and ASTM guidelines. Various tests were conducted on GI <b>wire</b> <b>fibers</b> as well as plain concrete reinforced with GI <b>wire</b> <b>fibers.</b> The experimental results show that GI <b>wire</b> <b>fiber</b> has compatible properties with steel fibers. Moreover, compressive strength, flexural strength, toughness indices and residual strength factors of GI <b>wire</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced concrete (GFRC) have shown significant improvement compared to normal concrete. A comparison with Steel Fiber Reinforced Concrete (SFRC) revealed that performance of GFRC is quite similar to that of SFRC. It was observed that fiber content of 2. 5 - 3. 5 % by weight produces relatively better results for the particular mix design used in the study. Furthermore, a cost analysis reveals that SFRC is about 19 % more expensive than GFRC in Bangladesh; for 1 cubic meter of concrete work when fiber dosage is 2. 5 % by weight. Therefore, the study finds that GFRC has shown some promising results to be a low-cost alternative to steel fiber reinforced concrete from Bangladesh’s perspective...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} Cubesat bus {{limitations}} is the available on-board power. The maximum power obtained using body mounted solar panels and advanced triple junction solar cells on a triple unit Cubesat is typically less than 10 W. The Cubesat performance and the mission scenario opened to these small satellite systems could be greatly enhanced by an increase of the available power. This paper describes the design and realization of a modular deployable solar panel system for Cubesats, consisting of a modular hinge and spring system that can be potentially used on-board single (I U), double(2 U), triple (3 U) and six units (6 U) Cubesats. The size of each solar panels {{is the size of}} a lateral Cubesat surface. The system developed is the basis for a SADA (Solar Array Drive Assembly), in which a maneuvering capability is added to the deployed solar array in order to follow the apparent motion of the sun. The system design trade-off is discussed, comparing different deployment concepts and architectures, leading to the final selection for the modular design. A prototype of the system has been realized for a 3 U Cubesat, consisting of two deployable solar panel systems, made of three solar panels each, for,a total of six deployed solar panels. The deployment system is based on a plastic <b>fiber</b> <b>wire</b> and thermal cutters, guaranteeing a suitable level of reliability. A test-bed for the solar panel deployment testing has been developed, supporting the solar array during deployment reproducing the dynamical situation in orbit. The results of the deployment system testing are discussed, including the design and realization of the test-bed, the mechanical stress given to the solar cells by the deployment accelerations and the overall system performance. The maximum power delivered by the system is about 50. 4 W BOL, greatly enhancing the present Cubesat solar array performance. (C) 2013 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|In July 2013, a {{miniature}} horse {{presented to the}} Cornell University Equine and Farm Animal Hospital Orthopedic Surgery Service with the complaint of acute, non-weight bearing lameness of the right hind limb. A coxofemoral luxation was diagnosed {{using a combination of}} physical exam, radiographic and computer tomography findings. The luxation was surgically reduced and secured with an extra-capsular suture technique using screws and <b>fiber</b> <b>wire.</b> Within 48 hours, the repair had failed and re-luxation occurred. The horse was again brought for surgical repair of the luxation using a similar technique using additional wire and screws. 72 hours later the horse luxated a third time, and a femoral head and neck ostectomy was elected. Following the third surgery an infection developed with multiple drug resistant bacteria cultured from the site. Stent bandages that had previously been covering the incision site were replaced with a sterile vacuum-assisted wound closure system to aid in removal of purulent drainage from the site, and antibiotics were chosen based on susceptibility results from the culture. Breakdown of the left hind limb suspensory mechanisms began to occur with the prolonged reduced weight bearing of the right hind limb. This was addressed through various techniques, including pain management, shoeing, and physical therapy to encourage use of the right hind limb. Over the next few weeks management for pain, infection, and breakdown of the opposite leg was performed with positive initial results. However, about one month after the initial presentation to the Cornell Equine and Farm Animal Hospital, the horse suffered an episode of a sudden increase in pain and discomfort, reverting to almost complete non-weight bearing lameness. Radiographs and CT evaluation were performed to rule out causes of the sudden increase in pain, with the only notable finding being contact between the femur and acetabulum. A femoral and sciatic nerve block were performed using EMG to attempt to isolate pain and rule out neuropathic causes, and an epidural catheter was placed for regular infusion of pain medication.
