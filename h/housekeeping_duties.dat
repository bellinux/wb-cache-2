However, with the inevitable [...] "typos" [...] and romantic notions of their growing audience they arrived at the more popular literary reference of The Lighthouse Keepers. This ambiguity was illustrated in a detailed pen and ink drawing by Chloe Brookes-Kenworthy which was used as a tour poster; a Thumbnail is posted on the LHK vitual archive. The initialism LHK emerged at ad hoc production meetings associated with the cottage industry self-managed business style coordinated by drummer Steven Williams.|$|E
5000|$|The NDR series robot [...] "Andrew" [...] (Robin Williams) is {{introduced}} in 2005 into the Martin family home to perform <b>housekeeping</b> and maintenance <b>duties.</b> The family's reactions range from acceptance and curiosity, to outright rejection, and deliberate vandalism by their rebellious older daughter, Grace (Lindze Letherman), who treats {{him as a}} mere robot and continues with her rebellious ways while growing up. This leads Andrew to discover that he can both identify emotions and reciprocate in kind. When Andrew accidentally breaks a figurine belonging to [...] "Little Miss" [...] Amanda (Hallie Kate Eisenberg), he carves a replacement out of wood, as way to apologize to her. The family is astonished by this creativity and “Sir” Richard Martin (Sam Neill) takes Andrew to his manufacturer, to inquire if all the robots are like him. The CEO of the company, Dennis Mansky (Stephen Root), sees this development as a problem and wishes to scrap Andrew. Angered, Martin takes Andrew home and allows him to pursue his own development, encouraging Andrew to educate himself in the humanities.|$|R
50|$|The women’s {{personal}} allowance {{was the same}} as the men’s, $5 per month for personal needs in exchange for 56 - 70 hrs work per month on camp work projects. No remittance was sent back home unlike the CCC men’s allowance. The camps were located where a facility had heat, lighting and sanitary conveniences: typically summer hotels, abandoned CCC camps and vacated schools. They were administered by female camp directors, project supervisors, staff teachers and counselors. The average camp had around 100 women, with a supervisory staff of 10-20 including cooks and a nurse. Each enrollee was assigned fixed hours of work on camp assignments, including working in forest nurseries at some camps. Others were making and repairing toys and playground equipment, while some worked at creating visual training aids for public schools. Those with visual disabilities (there were camps for the blind) would make finished bedding or use natural materials to create woven products. Sewing equipment enabled the women to make their own clothing (one popular class was to make dresses from empty cloth feed bags) and no uniforms were required. WPA programs also supplied clothing, and canneries were used as teaching aids and product generation. Layettes and hospital sundries were made for public institutions and other WPA nursing projects. Maintenance of the barracks, <b>housekeeping</b> and kitchen <b>duties</b> (KP) along with instruction in economics and cooking were integral to the residential program which lasted 3-4 months and was not subject to re-enrollment. The Native American women were paid an additional allotment to find rental housing and travelled with the men who went off the reservation to work. No camps were established exclusively for Native American men, so many travelled as a family group. Blacks were still segregated at this time but in their camps were given the same educational opportunities.|$|R
2500|$|Addams {{called on}} women, {{especially}} middle class women with leisure {{time and energy}} as well as rich philanthropists, to exercise their civic duty {{to become involved in}} municipal affairs as a matter of [...] "civic housekeeping." [...] Addams thereby enlarged the concept of civic duty to include roles for women beyond motherhood (which involved child rearing). Women's lives revolved around [...] "responsibility, care, and obligation," [...] which represented the source of women's power. This notion provided the foundation for the municipal or civil housekeeping role that Addams defined, and gave added weight to the women's suffrage movement that Addams supported. Addams argued that women, as opposed to men, were trained in the delicate matters of human welfare and needed to build upon their traditional roles of housekeeping to be civic housekeepers. Enlarged <b>housekeeping</b> <b>duties</b> involved reform efforts regarding poisonous sewage, impure milk (which often carried tuberculosis), smoke-laden air, and unsafe factory conditions. Addams led the [...] "garbage wars"; in 1894 she became the first woman appointed as sanitary inspector of Chicago's 19th Ward. With the help of the Hull-House Women's Club, within a year over 1000 health department violations were reported to city counsel and garbage collection reduced death and disease.|$|E

60|$|Great choice, {{according}} to the captain, is certainly displayed by the beaver in selecting the wood which is to furnish bark for winter provision. The whole beaver household, old and young, set out upon this business, and will often make long journeys before they are suited. Sometimes they cut down trees of the largest size and then cull the branches, the bark of which is most to their taste. These they cut into lengths of about three feet, convey them to the water, and float them to their lodges, where they are stored away for winter. They are studious of cleanliness and comfort in their lodges, and after their repasts, will carry out the sticks from which they have eaten the bark, and throw them into the current beyond the barrier. They are jealous, too, of their territories, and extremely pugnacious, never permitting a strange beaver to enter their premises, and often fighting with such virulence as almost to tear each other to pieces. In the spring, which is the breeding season, the male leaves the female at home, and sets off {{on a tour of}} pleasure, rambling often to a great distance, recreating himself in every clear and quiet expanse of water on his way, and climbing the banks occasionally to feast upon the tender sprouts of the young willows. As summer advances, he gives up his bachelor rambles, and bethinking himself of <b>housekeeping</b> <b>duties,</b> returns home to his mate and his new progeny, and marshals them all for the foraging expedition in quest of winter provisions.|$|E

Licensing standards for practical nurses came later than those for professional nurses; by 1945, 19 states and one territory had licensure laws, but only one state law covered practical nursing. By 1955, however, every state had licensing laws for practical nurses. Practical nurses who had been functioning as such at the time new standards were adopted usually granted a license by waiver, and exempt from new training requirements.|$|E

Thinking they can get anything they want, Duke and Chester adopt the tough persona and head to the saloon. They argue over who gets to hold the map and decide to tear it in half and each man keep his for safe keeping.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the immense}} success of Strong House, built {{just four years}} prior, Raymond House was erected in 1897. The {{dormitory}} was built {{at the same time}} as the nearby Rockefeller Hall. Unlike Strong and Davison Houses, which were funded by money donated to the college by trustee John D. Rockefeller, Raymond was paid for completely by Vassar College. Raymond was the third dormitory built on campus and was named after Vassar's second president, John Howard Raymond. The first cooperative living plan that the college ever offered was in Raymond from its construction until the 1942-1943 academic year. A $115 deduction in annual bill was given to students living in Raymond in exchange for performing <b>housekeeping</b> <b>duties</b> throughout the year.|$|E

5000|$|Not {{only did}} the Civil Rights Movement {{primarily}} focus on the oppression of black men, but many black women faced severe sexism within civil rights {{groups such as the}} Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. A group of women in the SNCC (who were later identified as white allies Mary King and Casey Hayden) openly challenged the way women were treated when they issued the [...] "SNCC Position Paper (Women in the Movement)". The paper listed 11 events in which women were treated as subordinate to men.

50|$|During {{the first}} period of Estonian {{independence}} in the inter-war years, Great Britain, and, especially, London, became a magnet for many young people from Estonia wishing to learn English. This was made easier by a bi-lateral agreement drawn up by the British (Agreement A), which allowed foreigners to live with English families and get board and lodging in return for <b>housekeeping</b> <b>duties.</b> After the initial influx, the number of Estonian immigrants gradually reduced as people were more able to find work and, as a result, they gravitated to a few towns and cities, in particular London, Leicester and Bradford, with smaller communities in and around Bolton, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Nottingham, Bournemouth and some {{north of the border}} in Scotland. In the early 1950s, many Estonians left to live in other countries, leaving less than 6000 in Britain.|$|E
