50|$|Like the {{predecessor}} WB 100+ Station Group, The CW Plus utilizes a <b>dual</b> <b>programming</b> model differing from CW-affiliated stations in large and medium-sized markets. Dayparts on CW Plus affiliates with no CW programming are programmed by the network - primarily featuring programs currently airing in syndication, with syndicated film packages filling select weekend timeslots, and paid programming filling overnight and some early afternoon timeslots; this relieves the local affiliate's operator from {{the duty of}} having to acquire syndicated programming to fill timeslots outside of The CW's network schedule. However, some over-the-air CW Plus affiliates may fill paid programming time with content from another subchannel network such as MeTV, This TV or Antenna TV, particularly if the network whose content is sourced {{does not have an}} existing full-time affiliate in the market. The operator of the CW Plus affiliate handles local advertising sales for the station, cable-only outlet or subchannel, which incorporates local commercial inserts during CW network and syndicated programming supplied by the service.|$|E
50|$|The WB 100+ Station Group {{utilized}} a <b>dual</b> <b>programming</b> model which {{differed from}} the traditional network affiliate model used by WB-affiliated stations in large and medium-sized markets, in which the affiliate handled complete responsibility of providing syndicated and local programming to fill non-network timeslots. Instead, dayparts on WB 100+ affiliates without WB programming were programmed by the network, primarily with programs that were being carried {{at the time in}} national syndication - along with syndicated film packages that filled select weekend timeslots, and brokered programming (such as infomercials and religious programs) that was time-leased by The WB to fill most overnight and some early afternoon timeslots on the service; this relieved the WB 100+ affiliate's local owner of the duty of acquiring syndicated programming to fill timeslots not occupied by network content from The WB. This was similar to the programming strategy of Foxnet, though unlike The WB 100+, Foxnet was distributed as a conventional cable channel and local operators were not allowed to tailor the service to their local market with their own branding, or carry local news or sports programming.|$|E
50|$|Otherwise, a <b>dual</b> <b>programming</b> {{model was}} {{utilized}} for Foxnet that {{differed from the}} traditional affiliate model - in which the local station handled responsibilities for acquiring and scheduling syndicated and local programming to fill timeslots not occupied by network content - {{that is used by}} Fox stations in large and medium-sized markets. Fox maintained responsibility over the programming of timeslots within Foxnet's schedule that were not occupied by Fox network programming, absolving the local cable provider of the duty of having to acquire syndicated programming to fill timeslots outside of Fox's network schedule. The acquired programs primarily consisted of shows that were airing at the time in national syndication and classic television series; syndicated film packages - with most titles being sourced from the 20th Century Fox library - usually filled select weekend timeslots (which following the incorporation of Fox Sports in 1994, began to be limited to weekend time periods that were not occupied by sports programming). Fox also leased time to direct response program producers and ministries to carry brokered programming (such as infomercials and religious programs) during overnight and some morning and early afternoon timeslots.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to find an exact least 2 -norm {{solution}} to a primal constrained linear programming problem in the standard form. Moreover, we can generate an exact solution to the <b>dual</b> <b>programming</b> problem using the exact least 2 -norm solution to the primal problem. The proposed algorithm is suitable for solving linear programming problems with a very large number of variables (10 5) and a very large number of constraints (10 6). The exact least 2 -norm solution to the primal problem is based on the minimization of exterior penalty functions dual of the <b>dual</b> <b>programming</b> problem. In practice for minimization, we use generalized Newton method and strong wolf conditions in order to find a corresponding suitable step size. This hybrid algorithm converges to the correct optimal solution independent of the values of the given starting point. It is shown that there are some problems that without using strong wolf conditions cannot be solved. The new algorithm can obtain least solution in comparison with MATLAB. Numerical results for a subset of problems from the Netlib collection and a subset of generated large scale linear programs are given. The hybrid algorithm is easy to implement and computationally very efficient. Comparisons are made with available literature...|$|E

40|$|A <b>dual</b> convex <b>programming</b> {{approach}} to solving linear programs with inequality constraints through entropic perturbation is derived. The amount of perturbation required {{depends on the}} desired accuracy of the optimum. The <b>dual</b> <b>program</b> contains only non-positivity constraints. An √É¬è√Ç¬µ-optimal solution to the linear program can be obtained effortlessly from the optimal solution of the <b>dual</b> <b>program.</b> Since cross-entropy minimization subject to linear inequality constraints is a special case of the perturbed linear program, the duality result becomes readily applicable. Many standard constrained optimization techniques can be specialized to solve the <b>dual</b> <b>program.</b> Such specializations, {{made possible by the}} simplicity of the constraints, significantly reduce the computational effort usually incurred by these methods.

The dual approach shows us how to make banks correctly internalize the intraday network externalities they create in the real-time gross settlement system and provides an objective standard for the daily microprudential surveillance of the payment system. ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{topology}} optimization method {{based on the}} element independent nodal density (EIND) is developed for continuum solids with multiple load cases and multiple constraints. The optimization problem is formulated ad minimizing the volume subject to displacement constraints. Nodal densities of the finite element mesh are used a the design variable. The nodal densities are interpolated into any point in the design domain by the Shepard interpolation scheme and the Heaviside function. Without using additional constraints (such ad the filtering technique), mesh-independent, checkerboard-free, distinct optimal topology can be obtained. Adopting the rational approximation for material properties (RAMP), the {{topology optimization}} procedure is implemented using a solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method and a <b>dual</b> <b>programming</b> optimization algorithm.
