40|$|The New Growth Theory and Coasean Economics: Institutions to Capture Externalities. — This paper {{presents}} the main theoretical arguments which lead many adherents of the New Growth Theory {{to the conclusion}} that externalities in research and development are important for economic growth and warrant government subsidies. In contrast, the authors point to private <b>institutions</b> like associations, <b>company</b> <b>structures</b> and industry clusters which can capture such externalities. An international comparison of private R&D investment and special features of institutions in Switzerland and Japan are in line with this hypothesis. Thus, the argument for R&D subsidies made by the New Growth Theory is considerably reduced...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{research}} paper {{focused on the}} corporate restructuring of Nippon Telegraph Telecommunication (NTT Group) under the pure holding <b>company</b> <b>structure</b> in 1999 and its implications. In {{order to understand the}} holding <b>company</b> <b>structure,</b> we introduced the concept of "internal capital markets" and explained its application within the framework of NTT Group. Next, we gave an account of the background events leading to NTT Group's corporate restructuring {{in order to understand the}} reason for choosing and keeping the holding <b>company</b> <b>structure.</b> Our research methodologies include interviews with NTT Group's management and data from public sources. Finally, to analyze the effect of the holding <b>company</b> <b>structure</b> to NTT Group, we conducted a hypothetical valuation analysis using the free cash flow model. Comparing the market value of NTT Group with our valuation results, it appeared that the market has undervalued NTT Group. We concluded our report with some suggestions on how NTT Group might be able to increase their market value. ...|$|R
