25|$|The {{following}} year, Johnny Baker {{returned as}} part of a larger crew to develop the previous gold finds and search for more. Gold was found on the east side of Yellowknife Bay in 1934 and the short-lived Burwash Mine was developed. When government geologists uncovered gold in more favourable geology on the west side of Yellowknife Bay in the fall of 1935, a small staking rush occurred. From 1935 to 1937, one prospector and trapper named Winslow C. Ranney staked in the area between David Lake and Rater Lake with few commercial results. The nearby hill known as Ranney Hill is his namesake and a popular hiking destination today. Although Con Mine was the most impressive <b>gold</b> <b>deposit</b> and its development created the excitement that led to the first settlement of Yellowknife in 1936–1937. Some of the first businesses were Corona Inn, Weaver & Devore Trading, Yellowknife Supplies and post office, and the Wildcat Cafe. Con Mine entered production on September 5, 1938. Yellowknife boomed in the summer of 1938 and many new businesses were established, including the Canadian Bank of Commerce, Hudson's Bay Company, Vic Ingraham's first hotel, Sutherland's Drug Store, and a pool hall.|$|E

2500|$|The {{population}} of Yellowknife quickly grew to 1,000 by 1940, and by 1942, five gold mines were in {{production in the}} Yellowknife region.

An exploration program at the Giant Mine property on the north end of town had suggested a sizable <b>gold</b> <b>deposit</b> in 1944. This new find resulted in a massive post-war staking rush to Yellowknife. It also resulted in new discoveries at the Con Mine, greatly extending the life of the mine.

2500|$|In 1999, {{the country}} was hit by one of its infamous zud spells, when summer draught and cold weather blizzards {{resulted}} in severe food shortages and loss of thousands of livestock. The government responded poorly to the disaster and the MPRP received an unexpected boost from the climatological disaster. Enkhbayar's leading MPRP won 2000 parliamentary elections winning 72 out of 76 seats. The MPRP controlling the parliament, Enkhbayar became the country's Prime Minister. He initiated an ambitious Millennium Road project to connect Mongolian territory from east to west. The road to connect Mongolia to Asian highway was never completed.

[...] The secret deal went through and without tender bids Enkhbayar's government gave a 100% exploitation license of Mongolia's Oyu Tolgoi-the biggest copper and <b>gold</b> <b>deposit</b> available in the world-to Ivanhoe Mines company in December 2003. The Russian Federation wrote off 97% of former USSR loans to Mongolia, which was estimated to amount to US$11.3 billion on December 31, 2003.

[...] The two Prime Ministers Enkhbayar and Kasyanov knew where the 50 million USD which completely disappeared from the transaction. Also this was the first time since the 1920s that Mongolia did not owe debt to its northern neighbor, while it was controversial debt due to Mongolia being a raw material supplier to Soviet Union pricing the materials almost free for former USSR.

6000|$|His {{condemnation}} of the gulch was sweeping, original, and striking.

The theory was to us, at that time, novel and attractive. It was true that the scientific explanation, although full and gratuitous, sounded vague and incoherent. It was true that the geological terms were not always correct, and their pronunciation defective, but we accepted such extraordinary discoveries as [...] "ignus fatuus rock," [...] "splendiferous drift," [...] "mica twist" [...] (recalling a popular species of tobacco), [...] "iron pirates," [...] and [...] "discomposed quartz" [...] as part of what he not inaptly called a [...] "tautological formation," [...] and were happy.

Remobilisation of pre-existing gold mineralization by low-temperature, highsalinity brines is recognised in a number of <b>gold</b> <b>deposits</b> worldwide.
