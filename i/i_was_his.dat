Three months later, on 3 January 1586, in {{the city}} of Dessau, Augustus married {{secondly}} with Agnes Hedwig, a daughter of Joachim Ernest, Prince of Anhalt. The bride was only 13 years; the groom, almost 60. August died one month after his new marriage, and was buried at Freiberg Cathedral.

Rabelais probably spent some time in hiding, threatened by being labelled a heretic. Only the protection of du Bellay saved Rabelais after the condemnation of his novel by the Sorbonne. They put Gargantua and Pantagruel on their index in 1542, the Third Book in 1546–1547, and the Fourth Book in 1552.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the 1980s, the {{earliest}} known inscription attesting king Odaenathus was dated to 257, leading traditional scholarship to believe that Hairan Ras of Palmyra {{is the father of}} the king and that Odaenathus <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> grandfather. However, an inscription published in 1985 by archaeologist Michael Gawlikowski and dated to 252 mentions king Odaenathus as a [...] "Ras" [...] and records the same genealogy found in the sepulchral inscription confirming the name of king Odaenathus' grandfather as Wahb Allat. Therefor, it is certain that king Odaenathus is the builder of the tomb ruling out the existence of [...] "Odaenathus I". Ras Hairan mentioned in the 251 inscription is identical with Odaenathus' elder son and co-ruler prince Hairan I.|$|E

[...] Oxley would later {{collaborate}} with artists like Australian singer Kylie Minogue, and in an interview he talked about working with her and Stefani, saying [...] "I've been very lucky {{to work with people}} {{at the top of the}} industry. Both were very talented and more creative than I think they’re given credit for. They’re both very good writers and singers and they both work so hard, just grafting the whole time.

The song particularly resonates with its composer's widow, Olivia Harrison. [...] "George singing was always beguiling to me", she writes in her {{introduction to the}} posthumous edition of I, Me, Mine, [...] "and countless times <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> audience of one. Run of the Mill was a song I often asked him to play, the lyrics so wise, especially the reminder that, 'Tomorrow when you rise, another day for you to realise me' ('me' being God)..." [...] Speaking to Mojo magazine in December 2011, ten years after her husband's death, Olivia Harrison named it as the song that most reminded her of Harrison. Music critic Tim Riley calls it [...] "the best of the lot" [...] on All Things Must Pass.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rex Reed in his book People Are Crazy Here (1974), Baker revealed that she had felt pressure in both her working relationship with Levine, and her domestic life with her husband, the latter of whom she said wanted to maintain an expensive lifestyle: [...] "We'd been very poor when we started out at the Actors Studio in New York," [...] she told Reed. [...] "I was under contract to Joe Levine, who was going around giving me diamonds and behaving like he owned me. I never slept with him or anything, but everyone thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> mistress." [...] In the spring of 1966, Baker returned to theatre, performing in a production of Anna Christie at the Huntington Hartford Theater in Los Angeles. The production was directed by [...] Garfein. The production was heralded as the [...] "theatre event of the week" [...] in Los Angeles, though its reception was middling. Cecil Smith of The Los Angeles Times wrote of the production: [...] "The beautiful Miss Baker's vehicle becomes a hearse." [...] The play was also performed at the Tappan Zee Playhouse in Nyack, New York in June 1966.|$|E
500|$|Conflict, or Angelou's {{presentation}} of opposites, is another theme in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas. As Lupton states, Angelou constructs a plot by mixing opposing incidences and attitudes - Angelou's [...] "dialectical method". The book {{is full of}} conflicts: in Angelou's marriage, her feelings between being a good mother and a successful performer, the stereotypes about other races, and her new experiences with whites. Lupton believes this {{presentation of}} conflict is what makes Angelou's writing [...] "brilliant"; she finds that the strength of Singin' and Swingin' [...] comes, in part, from Angelou's duplication of conflicts underlying the plot, characters, and thought patterns in the book. Lupton adds, [...] "Not many other contemporary autobiographers {{have been able to}} capture, either in a single volume or in a series, the opposition of desires that is found in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas and, to a lesser extent, in Angelou's other volumes". Even the closing sentence of the book ("Although I was not a great singer <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> mother, and he was my wonderful, dependently independent son") demonstrates Angelou's dialectical construction, sums up the contradictions of Angelou's character, and alludes to mother/son patterns in her later books.|$|E

500|$|Nagachandra, {{a scholar}} and the builder of the Mallinatha Jinalaya (a Jain temple {{in honour of}} the 19thJain tirthankar, Mallinatha, in Bijapur, Karnataka), wrote Mallinathapurana (1105), {{an account of the}} {{evolution}} of the soul of the Jain saint. According to some historians, King Veera Ballala <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> patron. Later, he wrote his magnum opus, a Jain version of the Hindu epic Ramayana called Ramachandra Charitapurana (or Pampa Ramayana). Written in the traditional champu metre and in the Pauma charia tradition of Vimalasuri, it is the earliest extant version of the epic in the Kannada language. The work contains 16sections and deviates significantly from the original epic by Valmiki. Nagachandra represents King Ravana, the villain of the Hindu epic, as a tragic hero, who in a moment of weakness commits the sin of abducting Sita (wife of the Hindu god Rama) but is eventually purified by her devotion to Rama. In a further deviation, Rama's loyal brother Lakshmana (instead of Rama) kills Ravana in the final battle. Eventually, Rama takes jaina-diksha (converts to Digambara monk), becomes an ascetic and attains nirvana (enlightenment). Considered a complementary work to the Pampa Bharatha of Adikavi Pampa (941, a Jain version of the epic Mahabharata), the work earned Nagachandra the honorific [...] "Abhinava Pampa" [...] ("new Pampa"). Only in the Kannada language do Jain versions exist of the Hindu epics, the Mahabharata and Ramayana, in addition to their brahminical version.|$|E
