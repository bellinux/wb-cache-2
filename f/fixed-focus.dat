25|$|The Riga Minox camera, {{along with}} the luxury finish postwar cameras, are now collector's items. Newer {{electronic}} versions, such as the Minox TLX, remain in production, essentially unchanged in features from the LX model since the late 1970s. With {{the introduction of the}} LX came significant redesign of the camera's basic controls. There is also the fully electronic entry-level model, the EC, which has a very different internal design and has a <b>fixed-focus</b> lens. The production rate for these cameras is considerably slower than in former years, however, as Minox devotes more time to the design and marketing of OEM cameras under the Minox brand.|$|E
25|$|Android devices {{incorporate}} many optional hardware components, including still {{or video}} cameras, GPS, orientation sensors, dedicated gaming controls, accelerometers, gyroscopes, barometers, magnetometers, proximity sensors, pressure sensors, thermometers, and touchscreens. Some hardware components are not required, but became standard in certain classes of devices, such as smartphones, and additional requirements apply {{if they are}} present. Some other hardware was initially required, but those requirements have been relaxed or eliminated altogether. For example, as Android was developed initially as a phone OS, hardware such as microphones were required, while over time the phone function became optional. Android used to require an autofocus camera, which was relaxed to a <b>fixed-focus</b> camera if present at all, since the camera was dropped as a requirement entirely when Android started to be used on set-top boxes.|$|E

50|$|Special-purpose cameras {{such as the}} Agiflite {{are used}} for {{situations}} like aerial photography from aircraft. Because the ground {{is far from the}} camera, focus adjustment is not necessary. Light-field cameras use <b>fixed-focus</b> lenses, since the focus can be set when the picture is displayed. For 35 mm cameras, some superwide <b>fixed-focus</b> lenses have been made.|$|E

50|$|Rather {{than having}} a method of {{determining}} the correct focusing distance and setting the lens to that focal point, a <b>fixed-focus</b> lens relies on sufficient depth of field to produce acceptably sharp images. Most cameras with focus-free lenses also have a relatively small aperture, which increases the depth of field. <b>Fixed-focus</b> cameras with extended depth of field (EDOF) sometimes are known as full-focus cameras.|$|E
50|$|The DX-10 was an {{entry-level}} Fujifilm {{digital camera}} featuring an 810,000 pixel sensor (1024x768 or 640x480 image size) and a <b>fixed-focus</b> lens. It {{was introduced in}} 1999.|$|E
50|$|As the hyperfocal {{distance}} {{is the focus}} distance giving the maximum depth of field, {{it is the most}} desirable distance to set the focus of a <b>fixed-focus</b> camera.|$|E
50|$|It was {{a compact}} <b>fixed-focus</b> {{point and shoot}} camera using the Advanced Photo System, sold in Europe as the IXUS FF25 and in Japan as the IXY 10.|$|E
50|$|The U8150 {{features}} a 2.8-inch glass capacitive touchscreen. It also {{features a}} 3.16 megapixel <b>fixed-focus</b> camera, Bluetooth connectivity, built-in GPS/AGPS. A microSD slot is located under the phone's battery cover.|$|E
50|$|On {{the back}} of the device is a 2-megapixel <b>fixed-focus</b> camera without flash that can record videos in up to a maximum QVGA Resolution. Galaxy Chat does not have a front-facing camera.|$|E
50|$|The IndyCam {{was a small}} <b>fixed-focus</b> camera {{intended}} to sit {{on top of the}} monitor of SGI systems. SGI originally distributed it with the Indy workstation. It can also connect to the Indigo2 video option.|$|E
50|$|Webcams {{typically}} {{include a}} lens, an image sensor, support electronics, {{and may also}} include a microphone for sound. Various lenses are available, the most common in consumer-grade webcams being a plastic lens that can be screwed in and out to focus the camera. <b>Fixed-focus</b> lenses, which have no provision for adjustment, are also available. As a camera system's depth of field is greater for small image formats and is greater for lenses with a large f-number (small aperture), the systems used in webcams have a sufficiently {{large depth of field}} that the use of a <b>fixed-focus</b> lens does not impact image sharpness to a great extent.|$|E
50|$|Android used {{to require}} an {{autofocus}} camera, which was relaxed to a <b>fixed-focus</b> camera if present at all, since {{the camera was}} dropped as a requirement entirely (except for smartphones) when Android started to be used on set-top boxes.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the camera}} lens is focused at or beyond its hyperfocal distance, then {{the depth of}} field becomes large, {{covering}} everything from half the hyperfocal distance to infinity. This effect is used to make [...] "focus free" [...] or <b>fixed-focus</b> cameras.|$|E
50|$|On {{the back}} of the device is a 5-megapixel camera with single LED flash that can record videos in up to a maximum 720p high-definition (HD). There is also a <b>fixed-focus</b> front-facing VGA camera for video calling, taking photos as well as general video recording.|$|E
50|$|The device {{features}} Bluetooth, a 1.3-megapixel <b>fixed-focus</b> camera, front VGA (0.3-megapixel) {{video call}} camera, hot swappable Dual Voltage Reduced Size MMC (DV-RS-MMC) memory expansion card support, stereo audio playback and a 2.1", 176x208, 18-bit (262,144) color display with {{automatic brightness control}} based on the environment.|$|E
50|$|Disposable or {{single-use}} camera {{is a simple}} box camera meant to be used once. Most use <b>fixed-focus</b> lenses. Some are equipped with an integrated flash unit, and there are even waterproof versions for underwater photography. Internally, the cameras use a 135 film or an APS cartridge.|$|E
50|$|The first Minolta 16 {{camera was}} the 16 Automat (1955), which was almost {{identical}} to the Konan 16 Automat. It featured a <b>fixed-focus</b> 25mm lens, apertures from f/3.5 to f/11, and shutter speeds from 1/50 to 1/200 plus bulb. Film advance was via a Minox-style push-pull housing.|$|E
50|$|On {{the back}} of the device is a 2-megapixel <b>fixed-focus</b> camera without flash that can record videos in up to a maximum QVGA Resolution. The Samsung Galaxy Y does not have a front-facing camera and not even a {{secondary}} microphone for Noise Cancellation, likely due to cost cutting measures.|$|E
50|$|Especially {{suitable}} are <b>fixed-focus</b> lenses for low-resolution CCD cameras {{as found}} in webcams, surveillance cameras and camera phones, because the low resolution of the image sensor allows a loose focusing on the CCD without noticeable loss of image quality. This makes a bigger circle of confusion and smaller hyperfocal distance.|$|E
50|$|On {{the back}} of the device is an 5-megapixel camera with single LED flash that can record videos in high-definition 720p. There is also a <b>fixed-focus</b> front-facing 1.3-megapixel camera for video calling, taking photos as well as general video {{recording}}. The video recording has been criticized for the lack of focus.|$|E
50|$|In May 2013 her {{official}} visitors' book, and Captain Kock's <b>fixed-focus</b> Zeiss binoculars, {{taken as}} spoils of war by the British officer who commanded her prize crew, were {{shown on the}} BBC television series Antiques Roadshow by the officer's son, himself a former submarine captain, who used the binoculars during his career.|$|E
50|$|On {{the rear}} of the device, the iPhone 3G {{features}} the same <b>fixed-focus</b> 2.0 megapixel camera of its predecessor. This camera does not have optical zoom, flash, autofocus, or native video recording, although various applications became available to allow video recording on the device. The iPhone 3G's operating system supports the geotagging of photographs.|$|E
5000|$|TONE {{camera was}} a {{sophisticated}} Hit-type camera using 17.5 mm paper backed film, introduced by Toyo Kobi Optical Company in occupied Japan in 1948.Unlike other simple Hit-type cameras with a <b>fixed-focus</b> lens and single shutter speed, the TONE camera {{is a full}} function subminiature camera with focusing lens, variable aperture and variable shutter speed ...|$|E
50|$|The Nokia Asha’s {{camera is}} <b>fixed-focus,</b> can take photos of 2 MP quality {{and has the}} option of a 4× digital zoom. It has a focal length of 35 mm and a minimum {{focusing}} range of 60 cm. Camera features include: Auto and manual white balance, centre weighted auto exposure, exposure compensation, full screen viewfinder, landscape orientation and still image editor.|$|E
50|$|The 1st-generation iPhone and iPhone 3G have a <b>fixed-focus</b> 2.0-megapixel {{camera on}} the back for digital photos. It has no optical zoom, flash or autofocus, and does not {{natively}} support video recording. (iPhone (original) & 3G can record video via a third-party app available on the App Store, and jailbreaking also allows users to do so.) IPhone OS 2.0 introduced geotagging for photos.|$|E
5000|$|The J105 (Naite) is a Sony Ericsson {{mobile phone}} from its J series of phones, which was {{released}} on May 2009. It is a relatively cheap candybar phone that is placed {{at the bottom of}} Sony Ericsson's [...] "Greenheart" [...] range. The 2 MP <b>fixed-focus</b> camera is capable of capturing a still picture at a resolution of 1600x1200 pixels, and recording with a 320x240-pixel resolution and a 15 fps frame rate.|$|E
50|$|A {{photographic}} lens {{for which}} the focus is not adjustable is called a <b>fixed-focus</b> lens or sometimes focus-free. The focus is set {{at the time of}} lens design, and remains fixed. It is usually set to the hyperfocal distance, so that the depth of field ranges all the way down from half that distance to infinity, which is acceptable for most cameras used for capturing images of humans or objects larger than a meter.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} popular Brownie models was the Brownie 127, {{millions}} of which were sold between 1952 and 1967. The Brownie 127 was a simple bakelite camera for 127 film which featured a simple meniscus lens and a curved film plane to compensate for the deficiencies of the lens. Another simple camera was the Brownie Cresta which was sold between 1955 and 1958. It used 120 film and had a <b>fixed-focus</b> lens.|$|E
50|$|Fixed focus {{can be a}} less {{expensive}} alternative to autofocus, which requires electronics, moving parts, and power. Since <b>fixed-focus</b> lenses require no input from the operator, they are suitable for use in cameras designed to be inexpensive, or to operate without electrical power as in disposable cameras, or in low-end 35 mm film point and shoot cameras, or in cameras featuring simple operation. These are usually wide-angle lenses with fixed aperture, and cameras with these lenses generally use a viewfinder for composition.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of this design {{is that it can}} be produced very inexpensively, more so than autofocus or manual focus systems. The system is also effectively automatic; the photographer need not worry about the focal point for a given scene. <b>Fixed-focus</b> lenses are unable to produce sharp close-ups, or images of objects that are {{only a fraction of the}} hyperfocal distance from the camera which, depending on factors including the size of the camera, may be within 2.4 - 3.7 meters (8-12 feet).|$|E
