5|$|Branca {{began the}} game by {{retiring}} the first three batters; Eddie Stanky and Alvin Dark flied out while Don Mueller <b>grounded</b> <b>out.</b> In {{the bottom of the}} first, Carl Furillo <b>grounded</b> <b>out,</b> and Pee Wee Reese hit a single. After Duke Snider flied out, Reese was caught stealing second base to end the inning. In the second inning, Branca retired all three hitters; when the Dodgers came up to bat, Jackie Robinson flied out and Roy Campanella <b>grounded</b> <b>out.</b> Andy Pafko scored the game's first run with a home run to left field to make the score 1–0. After the third out, Willie Mays walked to start the third inning, and after the first out Stanky got the Giants' first hit, a single. After a fly out by Dark, the Giants remained without a run; Hearn retired all three batters {{in the bottom of the}} third to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|In {{the top of}} {{the ninth}} inning, Tigers' center fielder Austin Jackson {{executed}} an over-the-shoulder catch on the run to retire Cleveland's Mark Grudzielanek for the first out and preserve the perfect game, a play that has been compared to DeWayne Wise's leaping catch at the wall in the ninth-inning that preserved Mark Buehrle's perfect game in 2009. Mike Redmond <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> to make the second out of the inning. Jason Donald then hit a soft ground ball that first baseman Miguel Cabrera had to range far to his right to retrieve. Donald was ruled safe, giving him an infield single, but video replay showed that Cabrera's throw to Galarraga, who was covering first base, beat Donald to the bag. Donald advanced to second and third base on defensive indifference during Trevor Crowe's at-bat, until Crowe <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> to Brandon Inge, ending the game in a 3–0 victory for the Tigers.|$|E
5|$|Having {{failed to}} score a century in ten Tests and almost three years, the season saw Harvey at his {{productive}} best as South Africa, whom he had scored four centuries against three years earlier, toured Australia. On a slow pitch difficult for stroke play, and Harvey scored 109 and 52 in Brisbane where Australia <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> {{a victory in the}} First Test. He top-scored in the first innings and was the second top-score (run out) in the second.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in SAT solvers {{have made it}} attractive to translate a variety of problems to SAT. In many cases, the source language is a logic that includes quanti ers. <b>Grounding</b> <b>out</b> these quanti ers can be a bottleneck. One way to mitigate the problem is to join isomorphic subtrees of the ground formula, so that the syntax tree becomes a DAG. Because the ground tree is large, detecting isomorphism after <b>grounding</b> <b>out</b> is impractical. However, detecting isomorphism prior to <b>grounding</b> <b>out</b> will miss many isomorphisms in the ground form...|$|R

5|$|He {{made his}} major league debut on September 7, 2010, as a pinch hitter for Denard Span, {{striking}} out against Kansas City Royals' pitcher Jesse Chavez. He {{remained in the}} game, replacing Span in center field. He recorded his first major league run batted in (RBI) on September 18, 2010, when he <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> to score J. J. Hardy {{in a game against}} the Oakland Athletics. He recorded his first major league hit a day later.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} inning, Taylor Douthit hit an infield single to shortstop Koenig, and Billy Southworth {{followed}} with a single to left field, advancing Douthit to second base. Hornsby laid down a sacrifice bunt to Shocker, moving each runner up a base. Bottomley hit a single into left field, scoring both Douthit and Southworth. The next two batters, Les Bell and Chick Hafey, hit into outs to conclude the inning. In {{the top of the}} seventh inning. Bob O'Farrell lined a double, and Tommy Thevenow {{followed with a}} single into left field. Pitcher Alexander popped up to Lazzeri, and Douthit followed with a fly ball to left field. Southworth then hit a three-run home run, giving the Cardinals a 5–2 advantage over the Yankees. Hornsby then <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> to Koenig to end the inning. Gehrig, Lazzeri and Dugan all <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> {{in the bottom of the}} seventh inning. In the top of the eighth, Bottomley hit a single into right field. Yankees manager Miller Huggins came out of the dugout and took Shocker out of the game, calling in Bob Shawkey from the bullpen to replace him. Shawkey struck out the first two batters he faced, and Bottomley was tagged out after attempting to steal second base. The Yankees could not produce any runs in their half of the inning.|$|E
5|$|Pollet {{started the}} game by {{retiring}} the first three Brooklyn hitters. Eddie Stanky <b>grounded</b> <b>out,</b> Cookie Lavagetto flied out to center field, and Joe Medwick <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> to end the inning. Branca took the mound {{in the bottom of}} the first, striking out Red Schoendienst and allowing a single to Terry Moore. After National League MVP Musial struck out, Enos Slaughter singled and Whitey Kurowski walked to load the bases. Joe Garagiola, Sr. brought in a run before being tagged out to end the inning with the score 1–0. In the second inning, Carl Furillo reached base on an error by Pollet. Pee Wee Reese singled, but Furillo was out at second. Another groundout brought the Cardinals back up, and the Dodgers got all three batters quickly out to end the inning. In the top of the third, Howie Schultz hit a home run on the first pitch he saw, tying the score at 1–1. After three more outs, St. Louis came back up to bat. Moore flied out, then Musial walked, and Slaughter singled. Musial scored on Kurowski's hit while Slaughter was called out, and after two more singles, the latter bringing in Kurowski, Branca was taken out of the game.|$|E

50|$|The {{two runs}} scored {{as a result}} of scrappy play from the Philadelphia offense. In the first inning, Lenny Dykstra walked, stole second, moved to third on a Pat Borders {{throwing}} error, and scored on a John Kruk <b>ground</b> <b>out.</b> In the second inning, Darren Daulton opened with a double, took third on a <b>ground</b> <b>out,</b> and scored on a Kevin Stocker single.|$|R

After the third out, the Dodgers came back to the plate. Reese <b>grounded</b> <b>out,</b> but Snider and Robinson hit {{back-to-back}} singles. Campanella grounded into a double play to end the inning. The Giants got one man on base {{in the top of the}} fifth inning, when Stanky singled with two outs. Pafko reached on an error to start off the bottom of the fifth, but was caught stealing second base; Gil Hodges and Branca both struck out to end the fifth. The only hit in the sixth inning was a single by Lockman, and the two teams entered the seventh inning with the score still 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Kirby Higbe {{replaced}} Branca on the mound, {{and ended}} the inning with the Cardinals in the lead, 3–1. Both teams combined for one {{hit in the}} fourth inning, a single by Moore. In {{the top of the}} fifth, Reese and Bruce Edwards singled, and Schultz <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> on a bunt. Stan Rojek pinch hit for Higbe, and walked, loading the bases. Stanky grounded into a double play, ending the inning without the Dodgers scoring any runs. In the bottom of the fifth, Hal Gregg replaced Higbe on the mound, and retired the side in order. The sixth inning contained just one baserunner — Schoendienst — who was stranded on first after hitting a single.|$|E
5|$|Now {{trailing}} by five runs, the Angels threatened {{again in}} the eighth inning with runners on second and third, but Hudler <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> to end the threat. In the bottom of the eighth, the Mariners again had the bases loaded when Tino Martinez singled to score Edgar Martínez, followed by a Dan Wilson double that scored Jay Buhner and Blowers, and finally a sacrifice fly double play hit by Cora that scored Tino Martinez but got Wilson thrown out at third. Tony Phillips led off the ninth for the Angels with a home run to avoid a shutout, but Johnson retired the next three Angels hitters to record his sixth complete game and 18th win of the season.|$|E

50|$|In Game 5 of the 2011 NLDS vs the St. Louis Cardinals, Howard was {{the last}} batter to <b>ground</b> <b>out</b> before the Phillies lost the series. Howard tore his Achilles tendon when running to first base on the final play of the game, a <b>ground</b> <b>out</b> to the second baseman, Nick Punto. His injury {{required}} surgery and as a result, he missed {{the start of the}} 2012 season.|$|R
5|$|Vic Lombardi {{replaced}} Behrman {{in the top}} of the sixth. He allowed {{just one}} hit to Dickson, keeping the score 5–1 when Brooklyn came up to bat. Whitman, Galan, and Dixie Walker all <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> to end the inning. In the top of the seventh, Lombardi allowed two walks, then Dusak hit a sacrifice bunt, after which Lombardi was replaced by Higbe. Marion hit a sacrifice bunt as well, which allowed Kurowski to score. Higbe quickly got the third out, and the Dodgers again went hitless in the seventh, making the score 6–1 at the end of seven innings. In the top of the eighth, Dickson struck out, while Red Schoendienst singled and Moore doubled. Musial was intentionally walked to load the bases, and Kurowski singled, allowing two baserunners to score and making the game 8–1 in favor of the Cardinals. After another walk, Higbe was replaced on the pitcher's mound by Rube Melton, who got the final two outs of the inning.|$|E
5|$|Both teams played {{each other}} in the last series of the season in what would be Derek Jeter's final games as a player before retirement. In Jeter's final game at Yankee Stadium against the Red Sox of his career, the Yankees won with a 9th-inning game-tying homerun by Mark Teixeira, {{followed}} by a walkoff blast by Chase Headley. Jeter said he would not play shortstop for the last series of the season in Boston, but would still bat as a designated hitter out of respect for the rivalry. Boston honored Jeter with a pregame ceremony including Red Sox retired stars Carl Yastrzemski, Jim Rice, Fred Lynn, Luis Tiant and Rico Petrocelli, the Boston Bruins' Bobby Orr, New England Patriots receiver Troy Brown and the Boston Celtics' Paul Pierce. In his last at bat as a professional player, Jeter <b>grounded</b> <b>out,</b> but drove in a run. Writer Peter Gammons who was in attendance at the game was also at Fenway during Ted Williams' final at bat where he hit a homerun 54 years prior to the day. Despite the rivalry, many Boston fans at Fenway Park loudly cheered for Jeter and gave him a standing ovation. The Yankees, though unable to reach the playoffs, finished in second place, while the Red Sox finished in last place, 25 games behind the first place Orioles.|$|E
5|$|Robertson {{held the}} Phillies {{scoreless}} {{for a second}} inning in the fourth. Jorge Posada entered as a pinch hitter in the fifth inning for José Molina and <b>grounded</b> <b>out.</b> Eric Hinske then pinch hit for Robertson and walked, advanced to third on a Derek Jeter single, and scored on a ground out by Damon. Alfredo Aceves entered as the new Yankee pitcher {{in the bottom of}} the fifth. The first batter he faced, Jayson Werth, hit a deep drive to center field but it was caught for an out by Gardner, who collided into the outfield wall to complete the play. Aceves completed the inning without a run scoring, inducing ground outs from Ibáñez and Ruiz. Phil Coke relieved Aceves in the seventh inning and allowed two Phillies players tie World Series records. First, Utley tied Reggie Jackson's record for most home runs in a World Series with a solo home run, his fifth of the series. Coke then struck out Howard, Howard's 12th strikeout in the series, tying Willie Wilson's record for most strikeouts in a World Series. Finally, Coke was driven from the game after allowing another solo home run, this time to Ibáñez, and was relieved by Phil Hughes.|$|E
50|$|The {{next four}} innings for the Yankees were plagued by double plays. Warren Spahn was getting <b>ground</b> <b>out</b> after <b>ground</b> <b>out</b> and the Yankees looked {{helpless}} until the ninth. With two outs and a three-run {{deficit in the}} top of the ninth, New York found new life in two back-to-back singles. Spahn gave up one to Berra, followed by one to McDougald. With two runners on, Howard hit a three-run homer to tie the game.|$|R

5|$|The Braves scored {{their fifth}} {{run in the}} eighth as Del Crandall hit a one-out triple and then scored on a {{sacrifice}} fly by Mantilla. Don Demeter pinch hit for Churn, the pitcher, in {{the bottom half of}} the inning but the Dodgers were put out in order. Sandy Koufax pitched the top of the ninth for the Dodgers and though he loaded the bases with three successive walks to Aaron, Torre, and DeMerit he did not allow any runs. Moon and Snider led off the bottom of the frame with successive singles. Bob Lillis pinch ran for Snider and Gil Hodges hit another single to load the bases. Don McMahon relieved Burdette, but allowed a fourth consecutive single to Norm Larker which scored Moon, Lillis, and advanced Hodges to third leaving the score 5–4. Warren Spahn relieved McMahon, Carl Furillo pinch hit for Roseboro, and Joe Pignatano pinch ran for Larker. Furillo tied the game, hitting a sacrifice fly which scored Hodges. Spahn allowed a single to Wills and was pulled in favor of Joey Jay. Ron Fairly <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> as a pinch hitter and Gilliam flew out, leaving the game tied at five runs apiece and forcing extra innings.|$|E
5|$|Granderson led off {{the first}} inning with a home run for the Mets, and scored the Mets' second run in the sixth inning. The Mets {{had a chance to}} break the game open in that sixth inning as they loaded the bases with no outs, but had to settle for one run after Céspedes lined a foul ball off his leg and was injured, leaving the game after popping up for the first out of the inning. Duda hit a {{sacrifice}} fly before d'Arnaud <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> to end the inning. Harvey pitched eight shutout innings for the Mets, and convinced Collins to keep him in the game for the ninth. He then gave up a leadoff walk to Cain in the ninth inning, and the Royals got a run when Hosmer drove Cain in with a double, prompting Collins to call upon Familia to relieve Harvey. After a groundout by Moustakas advanced Hosmer to third base with one out, Pérez hit a ground ball to third baseman Wright, who after checking Hosmer at third, threw to first base for the second out; however, Hosmer broke for home as soon as the ball was thrown, and Duda, who fielded the out at first, threw wide at home attempting to throw Hosmer out, and the latter scored the tying run, resulting in Familia blowing his third save of the postseason and the series; his eight save opportunities tied the postseason record set in 2002 by Robb Nen.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} year, the French continued to attack British trade convoys, achieving important victories at the Action of 18 November 1809 and the Action of 3 July 1810, where they captured another five East Indiamen {{as well as}} numerous smaller merchant ships and a large Portuguese frigate. Rowley too was active, commanding the successful Invasion of Île Bonaparte in July and renaming the island Île Bourbon, basing his squadron at Saint Paul on the island's eastern shore. From this base, Rowley's ships were ideally positioned to begin a close blockade of Isle de France, led initially by Captain Samuel Pym in HMS Sirius. Pym sought to reduce French movement by seizing a number of fortified offshore islands, starting with Île de la Passe off Grand Port. The island was captured, but when a French squadron broke through the British blockade and took shelter in Grand Port, Pym resolved to attack them. The ensuing Battle of Grand Port was a disaster for Rowley's squadron, as Pym led four of Rowley's five frigates into the bay without adequately assessing the channel through the coral reefs that sheltered the harbour. As a result, two frigates <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> of range of the enemy and the remaining two were outnumbered in confined waters. In a complicated battle lasting several days, two of Pym's frigates were captured and two more had to be scuttled, with their entire crews made prisoner. Rowley's reinforcements arrived too late, and the British commodore was chased back to Saint Denis by Hamelin's flagship.|$|E

5|$|Ron Perranoski {{entered as}} the new pitcher for the seventh, Camilli took his place {{as the new}} catcher, and Ron Fairly {{replaced}} Wally Moon at first base. Burright became the new second baseman, replacing Gilliam who moved to third base while the previous third baseman, Tommy Davis, moved to center field. Perranoski allowed singles to Orsino and Pagán after a ground out by Felipe Alou. The Giants pinch hit Harvey Kuenn for Matty Alou and Bob Nieman for Hiller, but both recorded outs to end {{the top of the}} seventh. Ernie Bowman replaced Nieman at second base for the Giants {{in the bottom of the}} inning and no runs scored in the frame. The Giants continued to hit Perranoski in the top of the eighth, with singles by Davenport and Mays to open the inning. Jack Smith entered in relief but allowed a single to Ed Bailey pinch hitting for Larsen which scored Davenport to cut the Dodgers' lead to 7–6. Mays attempted to advance to third on the play but was called out. The play drew arguments from Mays, Alvin Dark, and third base coach Whitey Lockman as third base umpire Jocko Conlan appeared to call Mays safe before changing it to out. Carl Boles pinch ran for Bailey, and Cepeda reached on an error on his fly ball which allowed Boles to move to third. Stan Williams relieved Smith and walked Felipe Alou to load the bases. Orsino hit a sacrifice fly to tie the game at seven runs apiece and Pagán <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> to end the inning.|$|E
25|$|In {{the top of}} the 12th, Drake hit {{the first}} batter he faced, George Johnson. Warfield singled to right, {{advancing}} Johnson to third. After Currie struck out, Briggs singled to left, scoring Johnson, and advanced to second on the throw to the plate. After Stephens struck out, Carr singled and drove in McNair and Warfield. Mackey then struck out to retire the side, but Hilldale was ahead 5 to 2. In the bottom of the inning, Sweatt <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> to the pitcher, Duncan flew out to left, and Foreman, pinch hitting for Drake, <b>grounded</b> <b>out</b> to second, ending the game.|$|E
