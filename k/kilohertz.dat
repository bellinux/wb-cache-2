5|$|Power is {{supplied}} to the chip in 1.7 microsecond pulses {{as determined by}} the storage time of a control transistor. An oscillator clock operating at 200 <b>kilohertz</b> during calculations and dropping to 15 <b>kilohertz</b> between each operation means shut off time ranges from 3.3 microseconds during calculations to over 65 microseconds between. The device relies on the capacitance of the chips to store information when there is no power, and 1.7 microseconds proved sufficient for the chip to carry out a single change of state of the electronics. Any calculation can be done in 1000 such changes. This had the effect of extending battery life to about 20 hours of continuous use with three small hearing aid batteries, equivalent to about four months of normal usage.|$|E
5|$|The {{various types}} of {{resonator}} are all particularly suited to different frequency bands. Overall, mechanical filters with lumped elements of all kinds can cover frequencies from about 5 to 700kHz although mechanical filters down as low as a few <b>kilohertz</b> (kHz) are rare. The lower part of this range, below 100kHz, is best covered with bar flexural resonators. The upper part is better done with torsional resonators. Drumhead disc resonators are in the middle, covering the range from around 100 to 300kHz.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is a {{powerful}} source of radio waves in the spectral region stretching from several <b>kilohertz</b> to tens of megahertz. Radio waves with frequencies of less than about 0.3MHz (and thus wavelengths longer than 1km) are called the Jovian kilometric radiation or KOM. Those with frequencies in the interval of 0.3–3MHz (with wavelengths of 100–1000m) are called the hectometric radiation or HOM, while emissions in the range 3–40MHz (with wavelengths of 10–100m) {{are referred to as}} the decametric radiation or DAM. The latter radiation was the first to be observed from Earth, and its approximately 10-hour periodicity helped to identify it as originating from Jupiter. The strongest part of decametric emission, which is related to Io and to the Io–Jupiter current system, is called Io-DAM.|$|E
5|$|Male mole crickets sing by stridulating, always underground. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa {{the song}} {{is based on an}} almost pure tone at 3.5 <b>kiloHertz,</b> loud enough to make the ground vibrate 20cm all round the burrow; in fact {{the song is}} unique in each species. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa the burrow is {{somewhat}} roughly sculpted; in Gryllotalpa vineae, the burrow is smooth and carefully shaped, with no irregularities larger than 1 millimetre. In both species the burrow {{takes the form of a}} double exponential horn with twin openings at the soil surface; at the other end there is a constriction, then a resonating bulb, and then an escape tunnel. A burrow is used for at least a week. The male positions himself head down with his head in the bulb, his tail near the fork in the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|When Backer et al. {{reported}} their finding in November 1982, {{they found that}} the rotation period of PSR B1937+21 was increasing at a rate of 3 seconds per second. Pulsars are expected to slow over time, as the energy that they emit is ultimately drawn from the rotational energy of the pulsar. Using the initially observed values for the period and spin down rate, and assuming a minimum period of 0.5 milliseconds for pulsars, the maximum age for PSR B1937+21 was found to be about 750 years old. The estimate of the minimum possible period is obtained from the centrifugal break-up limit, which is the rotational period at which the centrifugal force and the self-gravity of the pulsar are equal. The value of the minimum rotational period depends upon the neutron star equation of state, with different models giving values between 0.3 and 1 millisecond, which corresponds to a rotation frequency of 1-3 <b>kilohertz.</b> There may be mechanisms such as gravitational radiation which keep the pulsar from reaching this absolute limit, but pulsars can spin no faster.|$|E
25|$|Developments of {{adaptive}} optics include systems with multiple lasers over a wider corrected field, and/or working above <b>kiloHertz</b> rates for good correction at visible wavelengths; these {{are currently in}} progress but not yet in routine operation as of 2015.|$|E
25|$|Fast moving {{satellites}} {{can have}} a Doppler shift of dozens of <b>kilohertz</b> relative to a ground station. The speed, thus magnitude of Doppler effect, changes due to earth curvature. Dynamic Doppler compensation, where the frequency of a signal is changed multiple times during transmission, is used so the satellite receives a constant frequency signal.|$|E
25|$|Clock rate of a {{processor}} chip {{refers to the}} frequency at which the central processing unit (CPU) is running. It is used {{as an indicator of}} the processor's speed, and is measured in clock cycles per second or the SI unit hertz (Hz). For basic calculators, the speed can vary from a few hundred hertz to the <b>kilohertz</b> range.|$|E
25|$|Some {{countries}} have implemented Eureka-147 {{digital audio broadcasting}} (DAB). DAB broadcasts a single station that is approximately 1,500 <b>kilohertz</b> wide (~1,000 kilobits per second). That station is then subdivided into multiple digital streams of between 9 and 12 programs. In contrast FM HD radio shares its digital broadcast with the traditional 200 kilohertz-wide channels, with capability of 300 kbit/s per station (pure digital mode).|$|E
25|$|The North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement of 1932 {{mandated}} {{the change}} of broadcast frequencies {{of a number of}} radio stations to cause less interference in Canada and Mexico. Station WEVD was among those affected, forced to move from 1300 to 1330 <b>kilohertz.</b> At this time WEVD shared its broadcast frequency with another station, WHAP/WFAB — a station which was ultimately sold to WEVD and eliminated through merger in 1938.|$|E
25|$|One {{can think}} of MEMS {{resonators}} as small bells that ring at high frequencies. Small bells ring at higher frequencies than large bells, and since MEMS resonators are small they can ring at high frequencies. Common bells are meters down to centimeters across and ring at hundreds of hertz to kilohertz; MEMS resonators are {{a tenth of a}} millimeter across and ring at tens of <b>kilohertz</b> to hundreds of megahertz. MEMS resonators have operated at over a gigahertz.|$|E
25|$|Their slow-moving, curious nature, {{coupled with}} dense coastal development, {{has led to}} many violent {{collisions}} with propeller-driven boats and ships, leading frequently to maiming, disfigurement, and even death. As a result, {{a large proportion of}} manatees exhibit spiral cutting propeller scars on their backs, usually caused by larger vessels that do not have skegs in front of the propellers like the smaller outboard and inboard-outboard recreational boats have. They are now even identified by humans based on their scar patterns. Many manatees have been cut in two by large vessels like ships and tug boats, even in the highly populated lower St. Johns River's narrow channels. Some are concerned that the current situation is inhumane, with upwards of 50 scars and disfigurements from vessel strikes on a single manatee. Often, the lacerations lead to infections, which can prove fatal. Internal injuries stemming from being trapped between hulls and docks and impacts have also been fatal. Recent testing shows that manatees may be able to hear speed boats and other watercraft approaching, due to the frequency the boat makes. However, a manatee {{may not be able to}} hear the approaching boats when they are performing day-to-day activities or distractions. The manatee has a tested frequency range of 8 <b>kilohertz</b> to 32 <b>kilohertz.</b>|$|E
25|$|A planned opening date of 1 April 1966 {{had to be}} {{abandoned}} when the station's vessel, Oceaan 7, shed its radio mast. However, the station finally opened in June, broadcasting on 1115 <b>kilohertz,</b> 269 metres, in the medium wave. This wavelength was used by some existing radio stations in southern and eastern Europe but these were too far away for Radio 270 to cause them any trouble. However, the frequency was close to Radio London on 1133kHz, resulting in the potential for mutual interference on radios with less precise tuning.|$|E
25|$|For low {{to medium}} frequencies, {{conductors}} {{can be divided}} into stranded wires, each insulated from one another, and the relative positions of individual strands specially arranged within the conductor bundle. Wire constructed using this technique is called Litz wire. This measure helps to partially mitigate skin effect by forcing more equal current throughout the total cross section of the stranded conductors. Litz wire is used for making high-Q inductors, reducing losses in flexible conductors carrying very high currents at lower frequencies, and in the windings of devices carrying higher radio frequency current (up to hundreds of <b>kilohertz),</b> such as switch-mode power supplies and radio frequency transformers.|$|E
25|$|The {{spectral}} shape {{and intensity of}} the optical signals from the N-V− centers are sensitive to external perturbation, such as temperature, strain, electric and magnetic field. However, the use of {{spectral shape}} for sensing those perturbation is impractical, as the diamond {{would have to be}} cooled to cryogenic temperatures to sharpen the N-V− signals. A more realistic approach is to use luminescence intensity (rather than lineshape), which exhibits a sharp resonance when a microwave frequency is applied to diamond that matches the splitting of the ground state levels. The resulting optically detected magnetic resonance signals are sharp even at room temperature, and can be used in miniature sensors. Such sensors can detect magnetic fields of a few nanotesla or electric fields of about 10 V/cm at <b>kilohertz</b> frequencies after 100 seconds of averaging. This sensitivity allows detecting a magnetic or electric field produced by a single electron located tens of nanometers away from an N-V− center.|$|E
500|$|The other {{meaning of}} the term [...] "channel" [...] in {{telecommunications}} is seen in the phrase communications channel, which is a subdivision of a transmission medium {{so that it can be}} used to send multiple streams of information simultaneously. For example, one radio station can broadcast radio waves into free space at frequencies in the neighborhood of 94.5MHz (megahertz) while another radio station can simultaneously broadcast radio waves at frequencies in the neighborhood of 96.1MHz. Each radio station would transmit radio waves over a frequency bandwidth of about 180kHz (<b>kilohertz),</b> centered at frequencies such as the above, which are called the [...] "carrier frequencies". Each station in this example is separated from its adjacent stations by 200kHz, and the difference between 200kHz and 180kHz (20kHz) is an engineering allowance for the imperfections in the communication system.|$|E
500|$|Another {{basic concept}} is the charge pump, {{a version of}} which is shown schematically in figure 6. [...] The charge pump capacitor, CP, is first charged to the input voltage. [...] It is then {{switched}} to charging the output capacitor, CO, in series with the input voltage resulting in CO eventually being charged to twice the input voltage. [...] It may take several cycles before the charge pump succeeds in fully charging CO but after steady state has been reached it is only necessary for CP to pump {{a small amount of}} charge equivalent to that being supplied to the load from CO. [...] While CO is disconnected from the charge pump it partially discharges into the load resulting in ripple on the output voltage. [...] This ripple is smaller for higher clock frequencies since the discharge time is shorter, and is also easier to filter. [...] Alternatively, the capacitors can be made smaller for a given ripple specification. [...] The practical maximum clock frequency in integrated circuits is typically in the hundreds of <b>kilohertz.</b>|$|E
500|$|Astronomical optical {{interferometry}} {{has had to}} overcome a number of technical issues not shared by radio telescope interferometry. The short wavelengths of light necessitate extreme precision and stability of construction. For example, spatial resolution of 1 milliarcsecond requires 0.5µm stability in a 100m baseline. Optical interferometric measurements require high sensitivity, low noise detectors that did not become available until the late 1990s. Astronomical [...] "seeing", the turbulence that causes stars to twinkle, introduces rapid, random phase changes in the incoming light, requiring <b>kilohertz</b> data collection rates to be faster than the rate of turbulence. Despite these technical difficulties, roughly a dozen astronomical optical interferometers are now in operation offering resolutions down to the fractional milliarcsecond range. , a binary star system approximately 960 light-years (290 parsecs) away in the constellation Lyra, as observed by the CHARA array with the MIRC instrument. The brighter component is the primary star, or the mass donor. The fainter component is the thick disk surrounding the secondary star, or the mass gainer. The two components are separated by 1milli-arcsecond. Tidal distortions of the mass donor and the mass gainer are both clearly visible.|$|E
2500|$|In 1960, Cornell University {{astronomer}} Frank Drake {{performed the}} first modern SETI experiment, named [...] "Project Ozma", after the Queen of Oz in L. Frank Baum's fantasy books. Drake used a radio telescope [...] in diameter at Green Bank, West Virginia, to examine the stars Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani near the 1.420 gigahertz marker frequency, a region of the radio spectrum dubbed the [...] "water hole" [...] due to its proximity to the hydrogen and hydroxyl radical spectral lines. A 400 <b>kilohertz</b> band around the marker frequency was scanned, using a single-channel receiver with a bandwidth of 100 hertz. He found nothing of interest.|$|E
2500|$|Converting DC {{power from}} one voltage to another {{is much more}} complicated. [...] One method of DC-to-DC {{conversion}} first converts power to AC (using a device called an inverter), then uses a transformer to change the voltage, and finally rectifies power back to DC. A frequency of typically several tens of <b>kilohertz</b> is used, as this requires much smaller inductance than at lower frequencies and obviates the use of heavy, bulky, and expensive iron-cored units. Another method of converting DC voltages uses a charge pump, using rapid switching to change the connections of capacitors; this technique is generally limited to supplies up {{to a couple of}} watts, owing to the size of capacitors required.|$|E
2500|$|The tarsier is the {{smallest}} living primate that exists in several South East Asian countries today. The Philippine tarsier, Tarsius syrichta, locally known as [...] "mamag" [...] in Boholano is near to threatened according to the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. Adaptation to their large bulging eyes allows them to catch prey clearly at night, and with elongated limbs and fingers, leaping {{from tree to tree}} gives no limitation to the tarsier. Their brain is about the same size as their eyes. The connection between its eyes and brain serves a unique function to these animals which is important for their stability and balance. Tarsiers have incredible hearing abilities. They can hear a frequency of up to 91kHz (<b>kilohertz)</b> and send sounds of 70kHz.|$|E
2500|$|All {{electronic}} systems emit some unwanted radio frequency energy. [...] Various regulatory agencies (such as the FCC in the United States) put {{limits on the}} emitted energy and any interference caused by it. [...] The emitted noise generally appears at sharp spectral peaks (usually at the operating frequency of the device, and a few harmonics). [...] A system designer can use a spread-spectrum PLL to reduce interference with high-Q receivers by spreading the energy over a larger portion of the spectrum. [...] For example, by changing the operating frequency up and down by a small amount (about 1%), a device running at hundreds of megahertz can spread its interference evenly over a few megahertz of spectrum, which drastically reduces the amount of noise seen on broadcast FM radio channels, which have a bandwidth of several tens of <b>kilohertz.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Investors {{bought the}} Moulin Rouge Gardens {{property}} and spent one-million dollars {{to expand the}} facility. Opened in 1921, Mann's Million Dollar Rainbo Room, named after Fred Mann's wartime service in the U.S. Army's 42nd Infantry or [...] "Rainbow" [...] Division, {{was said to be}} the largest nightclub in America, featuring some {{of the biggest names in}} Vaudeville and musical entertainment. Larry Fine was performing there the night he was asked to join The Three Stooges. The Rainbo Room had a revolving stage to allow for continuous entertainment. There was table seating for 2,000 patrons and space on the dance floor for an additional 1,500. Until 1927, WMAQ radio shared the 670 <b>kilohertz</b> frequency with station WQJ, which was owned by the Rainbo and Calumet Baking Powder Company; it broadcast music of the Rainbo's performers as a form of promotion.|$|E
2500|$|By early 1923, the Daily News was {{convinced}} {{enough in the}} power of radio to buy out the Fair Store's 51% interest in the station. The Daily News moved the station and its transmitter to the tallest building in Chicago at the timethe La Salle Hotel on West Washington street in the West Loop. [...] With a new location and new frequency of 670 <b>kilohertz,</b> WMAQ went on the air July 2, 1923. The new frequency however, was not clear channel. [...] WMAQ had to share it with another local station, WQJ, which was jointly owned by the Calumet Baking Powder Company and the Rainbo Gardens Ballroom on North Clark Street. Rainbo was one of the country's top ballrooms and Calumet's broadcasts brought the company much publicity. The Daily News was not able to buy out WQJ until 1927 to make the 670 frequency a clear channel one.|$|E
2500|$|To {{conduct an}} atom probe {{experiment}} {{a very sharp}} needle shaped specimen is placed in an ultra high vacuum chamber. After introduction into the vacuum system, the sample is reduced to cryogenic temperatures (typically 20-100K) and manipulated such that the needle's point is aimed towards an ion detector. A high voltage {{is applied to the}} specimen, and either a laser pulse is applied to the specimen or a voltage pulse (typically 1-2kV) with pulse repetition rates in the hundreds of <b>kilohertz</b> range is applied to a counter electrode. The application of the pulse to the sample allows for individual atoms at the sample surface to be ejected as an ion from the sample surface at a known time. [...] Typically the pulse amplitude and the high voltage on the specimen are computer controlled to encourage only one atom to ionize at a time, but multiple ionizations are possible. The delay between application of the pulse and detection of the ion(s) at the detector allow for the computation of a mass-to-charge ratio.|$|E
2500|$|Professor Raymond Andrew at the University of Nottingham in the UK {{pioneered the}} {{development}} of high-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. He {{was the first to}} report the introduction of the MAS (magic angle sample spinning; MASS) technique that allowed him to achieve spectral resolution in solids sufficient to distinguish between chemical groups with either different chemical shifts or distinct Knight shifts. In MASS, the sample is spun at several <b>kilohertz</b> around an axis that makes the so-called magic angle θm (which is ~54.74°, where [...] ) with respect to the direction of the static magnetic field B0; as a result of such magic angle sample spinning, the chemical shift anisotropy bands are averaged to their corresponding average (isotropic) chemical shift values. The above expression involving cos2θm has its origin in a calculation that predicts the magnetic dipolar interaction effects to cancel out for the specific value of θm called the magic angle. One notes that correct alignment of the sample rotation axis {{as close as possible to}} θm is essential for cancelling out the dipolar interactions whose strength for angles sufficiently far from θm is usually greater than ~10kHz for C–H bonds in solids, for example, and it is thus greater than their CSA values.|$|E
2500|$|Although the South-eastern Long-eared Bat is not blind, {{like all}} microbats {{it relies on}} {{echolocation}} to hunt for food and to navigate and they do this with astonishing proficiency. [...] These high frequency sound waves (echolocation calls) are created by the bats pushing air through its vocal cords {{in the same way}} as people speak. These echolocation calls are sent out either through the mouth or the nostrils and the calls rebound back from the nearby objects and the bat's sensitive ears sense the echoes of their calls. The bat's brain converts these faint echoes into information about the distance, size and texture of the nearby objects. [...] These bat high frequency calls are defined by the number of vibrations per second and are more technically referred to as hertz (Hz). [...] It is noted that the number of vibrations of a normal bat call is 50000Hz or 50 <b>kilohertz</b> (kHz) which matches to a wavelength of 6.5mm, which is a perfect scale for gauging the size of small insects. [...] A bat will send out an echolocation call, it will then strike an insect or an obstacle and then some of it will return as an echo, the time taken for the echo to return will indicate how far away the insect or obstacle is.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{problems}} with the Armstrong method is that the frequency deviation—the amount of modulation—must be kept small to minimize distortion. [...] The maximum deviation is a fraction of 1 <b>kilohertz,</b> but FM broadcast requires 75 <b>kilohertz</b> deviation and a typical FM voice channel deviation is 5 <b>kilohertz.</b> To solve this problem, Armstrong multiplied the signal many times to a higher frequency to obtain the necessary deviation. For example, to generate an FM signal with 5 <b>kilohertz</b> deviation at 146.94 megahertz, the transmitter would generate a signal at 6.1225 megahertz with only 0.2 <b>kilohertz</b> deviation, and then multiply the signal 24 times.|$|E
