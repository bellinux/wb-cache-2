Both films were low-budget, and their American releases were delayed. Too <b>Hot</b> <b>to</b> Handle was not {{released in the}} United States until 1961 (as Playgirl After Dark), and The Challenge in 1963 (as It Takes a Thief). In the United States, censors objected to a scene in Too <b>Hot</b> <b>to</b> Handle where Mansfield, wearing silver netting with sequins painted over her nipples, appeared nearly nude.|$|E
5|$|If {{the mass}} of a main-sequence star is between 0.5 and 8 , its core will become {{sufficiently}} <b>hot</b> <b>to</b> fuse helium into carbon and oxygen via the triple-alpha process, but it will never become sufficiently <b>hot</b> <b>to</b> fuse carbon into neon. Near {{the end of the}} period in which it undergoes fusion reactions, such a star will have a carbon–oxygen core which does not undergo fusion reactions, surrounded by an inner helium-burning shell and an outer hydrogen-burning shell. On the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, it will be found on the asymptotic giant branch. It will then expel most of its outer material, creating a planetary nebula, until only the carbon–oxygen core is left. This process is responsible for the carbon–oxygen white dwarfs which form the vast majority of observed white dwarfs.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{winds are}} strongest {{immediately}} under the tropopause (except locally, during tornadoes, tropical cyclones or other anomalous situations). If two air masses of different temperatures or densities meet, the resulting pressure difference {{caused by the}} density difference (which ultimately causes wind) is highest within the transition zone. The wind does not flow directly from the <b>hot</b> <b>to</b> the cold area, but is deflected by the Coriolis effect and flows along the boundary of the two air masses.|$|E

5|$|After Mansfield's death, the {{documentary}} The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield (1968) included nude {{scenes from the}} film and pages from the Playboy pictorial, along with scenes from her other films including Too <b>Hot</b> <b>to</b> Handle (1960), The Loves of Hercules (1960) and L'Amore Primitivo (1964). Promises! Promises! was presented {{for the first time}} on television in its uncut form in 1984 on the Playboy Channel. A VHS release soon followed but was only briefly in print. On February 14, 2006, VCI Video released the film on DVD with extras such as original trailers and a gallery of stills from the Playboy issue along with never before released lobby cards.|$|E
5|$|Although Kapoor {{does not}} draw with {{computer}}s, computer modeling {{was essential to}} the process of analyzing the complex form, which created numerous issues. Since the sculpture was expected to be outdoors, concerns arose that it might retain and conduct heat {{in a way that would}} make it too <b>hot</b> <b>to</b> touch during the summer and so cold that one's tongue might stick to it during the winter. The extreme temperature variation between seasons was also feared to weaken the structure. Graffiti, bird droppings and fingerprints were also potential problems, as they would affect the aesthetics of the surface. The most pressing issue was the need to create a single seamless exterior for the external shell, a feat architect Norman Foster once believed to be nearly impossible.|$|E
5|$|Although Mansfield's film {{career was}} short-lived, she had several box-office successes {{and won a}} Theatre World Award and a Golden Globe. She enjoyed success {{in the role of}} fictional actress Rita Marlowe, both in the 1955–1956 Broadway version and the 1957 Hollywood film version of Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?. Her other major movie {{performances}} were for The Girl Can't Help It (1956), The Wayward Bus (1957), and Too <b>Hot</b> <b>to</b> Handle (1960). In the sexploitation film Promises! Promises! (1963), she became the first major American actress to have a nude starring role in a Hollywood motion picture. Mansfield took her professional name from her first husband, public relations professional Paul Mansfield. Mansfield's career came to an end when she was killed in a 1967 car accident at the age of 34.|$|E

5|$|Medical {{science of}} the Middle Ages had a {{considerable}} influence on what was considered healthy and nutritious among the upper classes. One's lifestyle—including diet, exercise, appropriate social behavior, and approved medical remedies—was the way to good health, and all types of food were assigned certain properties that affected a person's health. All foodstuffs were also classified on scales ranging from <b>hot</b> <b>to</b> cold and moist to dry, according to the four bodily humours theory proposed by Galen that dominated Western medical science from late Antiquity until the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species have}} a <b>hot</b> <b>to</b> very acrid taste {{and can cause}} {{gastrointestinal}} symptoms. Despite this, such species are eaten in some regions, e.g. Lactarius torminosus in Finland or Russia. Often, they are parboiled or pickled to make them palatable, and sometimes, they are used as spice, for example Russula emetica in Eastern Europe. Some species are however truly poisonous: the East Asian and North American Russula subnigricans causes rhabdomyolysis and is potentially lethal, and Lactarius turpis from Eurasia contains a mutagenic substance.|$|E
5|$|Stars {{are given}} a single-letter {{classification}} according to their spectra, ranging from type O, which are very <b>hot,</b> <b>to</b> M, which are so cool that molecules may form in their atmospheres. The main classifications in order of decreasing surface temperature are: O, B, A, F, G, K, and M. A variety of rare spectral types are given special classifications. The most common of these are types L and T, which classify the coldest low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Each letter has 10 sub-divisions, numbered from 0 to 9, in order of decreasing temperature. However, this system breaks down at extreme high temperatures as classes O0 and O1 may not exist.|$|E

5|$|If a star is massive enough, {{its core}} will {{eventually}} become sufficiently <b>hot</b> <b>to</b> fuse carbon to neon, {{and then to}} fuse neon to iron. Such a star will not become a white dwarf, because the mass of its central, non-fusing core, initially supported by electron degeneracy pressure, will eventually exceed the largest possible mass supportable by degeneracy pressure. At this point {{the core of the}} star will collapse and it will explode in a core-collapse supernova which will leave behind a remnant neutron star, black hole, or possibly a more exotic form of compact star. Some main-sequence stars, of perhaps 8 to 10 , although sufficiently massive to fuse carbon to neon and magnesium, may be insufficiently massive to fuse neon. Such a star may leave a remnant white dwarf composed chiefly of oxygen, neon, and magnesium, provided that its core does not collapse, and provided that fusion does not proceed so violently as to blow apart the star in a supernova. Although a few white dwarfs have been identified which may be of this type, most evidence for the existence of such comes from the novae called ONeMg or neon novae. The spectra of these novae exhibit abundances of neon, magnesium, and other intermediate-mass elements which appear to be only explicable by the accretion of material onto an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf.|$|E
5|$|Moonraker was {{published}} in the UK by Jonathan Cape in hardback format on 5 April 1955 with a cover designed by Kenneth Lewis, following Fleming's suggestions of using a stylised flame motif; the first impression was of 9,900 copies. The US publication was by Macmillan on 20 September that year. In October 1956 Pan Books published a paperback version of the novel in the UK, which sold 43,000 copies {{before the end of the}} year. In December that year the US paperback {{was published}} under the title Too <b>Hot</b> <b>to</b> Handle by Permabooks. This edition was rewritten to Americanise the British idioms used, and Fleming provided a number of explanatory footnotes such as the value of English currency against the dollar. Since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions, translated into several languages and has never been out of print.|$|E

He made three more trips. He was assisted by Frederick Blake, a wagon examiner and a navy veteran from World War I, who operated the points levers. When they finished, the right hand side of the footplate was too <b>hot</b> <b>to</b> touch, and Blake had to use his hat to work the points as the levers were also too <b>hot</b> <b>to</b> touch.
