500|$|Mars' {{music has}} been noted for {{displaying}} {{a wide variety of}} styles, musical genres, and influences, including pop, rock, reggae, R, soul, and hip hop. His debut album Doo-Wops & Hooligans, a pop record, is influence by these genres. His subsequent release, Unorthodox Jukebox, as with his debut album, is infused with different influences including dance, rock reggae and soul, as well as balladry. Lyrically, the album is different than the former, addressing traditional notions of romance, male chauvinism, and sexuality. The explicit content in the song [...] "Gorilla" [...] caused a controversy in Australia. Many of his songs, particularly on Doo-Wops & Hooligans, reflect [...] "feel-good", carefree, and optimistic sentiments. However, darker subjects are addressed in his songs, detailing failed relationships and self-destructive behaviour. Mars' third album, 24K Magic, is significantly influence by R, soul music and funk. Lyrically, the album involve themes of money and sex. Mars has explained his writing process: [...] "I don't sit down and think, 'I'm going to write a song', inspiration hits me always unexpectedly: on a plane, when I'm out or just before I go to bed. An idea will suddenly come to my mind, and sometimes <b>I</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> turn it into lyrics the next day. Sometimes it'll take me one year to get something real out of it. You can’t force creativeness." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{supplement}} his income, {{the young}} Domingo {{played the piano}} for a ballet company, [...] {{as well as for}} a program on Mexico's newly founded cultural television station. The program consisted of excerpts from zarzuelas, operettas, operas, and musical comedies. He acted in a few small parts while at the theater in plays by Federico García Lorca, Luigi Pirandello, and Anton Chekhov. He also provided song arrangements and backup vocals for Los Camisas Negras in the late 1950s, a rock-and-roll band led by César Costa. In his autobiography, Domingo reflected on the benefits of his busy and varied career as a teenager: [...] "Today, when people ask me how <b>I</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> hold up under my extremely heavy work load, I answer that I became accustomed to intense activity very early in my life and that I love it now as I loved it then." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 201, after Cao Cao {{defeated}} his northern rival Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, he sent Zhang Liao {{to pacify}} the various counties in Lu State, and then ordered him and Xiahou Yuan to lead an army {{to attack a}} minor warlord Chang Xi (昌豨) in Donghai Commandery (東海郡; around present-day Linyi, Shandong). Zhang Liao and Xiahou Yuan had besieged Chang Xi for months but were unable to defeat him and their supplies were running out, so they considered retreating. Zhang Liao told Xiahou Yuan, [...] "Over the past several days, whenever we attacked Chang Xi, I noticed he paid careful attention to me. He's also running short of arrows. I suspect he's having doubts, therefore he isn't {{doing his best to}} resist us. Wouldn't it be better if <b>I</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> persuade him to surrender?" [...] He then sent a message to Chang Xi and asked to speak to him. When Zhang Liao met Chang Xi, he told the latter that Cao Cao rewarded those who submitted to him. Convinced by Zhang Liao, Chang Xi agreed to surrender to Cao Cao. Zhang Liao then went to Chang Xi's home alone and visited his family. Chang Xi was delighted and he followed Zhang Liao and Xiahou Yuan back to meet Cao Cao.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I {{suppose it}} is because I try to have influence," [...] rejoined Pedro, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> have plenty of friends and foes,--the last being {{sometimes}} unreasonably bitter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Miss Carr. The fact is, I'm dead broke. I've lost {{everything}} since I saw you last. But as I {{know how to}} ride, and I'm not afraid of work, <b>I</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> keep along." ...|$|E

60|$|My hopes sank {{again as}} rapidly as they had risen. <b>I</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> answer him, however, without showing any change in my manner.|$|R
6000|$|I felt my hand tremble as it {{gripped the}} top rail of my chair, but <b>I</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> command the voice to answer, coldly enough: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you {{trouble to}} guess, at all, my dear; {{be content with}} the plum when it falls into your mouth, and don't worry {{yourself}} as to how <b>I</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> shake the tree to bring the fruit down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh dear, oh dear! {{she must}} be {{wandering}} in her mind,' murmured the lad to himself. 'How can <b>I</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> get her home? Dearest mother, do look at me close. Can't you see I am your own son Jem?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My {{mother has}} been so unwell of late that I {{do not like to}} be entirely out of reach all day,' {{returned}} Kalliope, who certainly looked worn and sorrowful; 'so <b>I</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> run home, though it is but for a quarter of an hour.' ...|$|E

60|$|I {{rolled my}} head {{negatively}} on the floor. “Your arguments are too—er—forcible,” <b>I</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> articulate, at cost of great pain to my aching throat.|$|R
60|$|Not without {{considerable}} danger <b>I</b> <b>managed</b> <b>to</b> tie {{the planks}} more tightly together. That rude structure now {{seemed to be}} our only hope for safety.|$|R
60|$|Not {{without a}} good deal of {{difficulty}} did <b>I</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> make him walk several blocks to a good though not stylish hotel. Here I took him into the office and explained the situation to the clerk in charge, who promptly assigned us to a room on the third floor.|$|E
6000|$|... "As sure as the Lord's in heaven," [...] {{said the}} doctor, now {{becoming}} a little uneasy {{at the idea}} that Lord Ballindine should think he had told so strange a story without proper foundation--"as sure as the Lord's in heaven, he offered me the farm for a reward, should <b>I</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> prevent his sister's recovery." ...|$|E
60|$|After all which quarrelling, I am {{delighted to}} have to talk of your coming nearer to me--within reach--almost within my reach.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she {{acknowledged}} with some bitterness; [...] "but I can hardly complain that I {{have no control}} over him. It would be astonishing if I had." [...] She broke into a little harsh laugh. [...] "Anyway, <b>I</b> <b>manage</b> <b>to</b> keep my head, and do not deceive myself, as he does.

6000|$|... "Grummidge," [...] said he, in a stern voice, as he {{squatted down}} on the floor beside the unfortunate seaman, [...] "things look bad, there's no doubt about that, an' it would be unkind {{deception}} to say otherwise, for that villain Bearpaw seems to git harder and harder the more they try to soften him.
