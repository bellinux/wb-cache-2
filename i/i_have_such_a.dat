In late 2007, American singer-songwriter Marié Digby posted an {{acoustic}} cover of [...] "Gimme More" [...] along with a cover of Rihanna's [...] "Umbrella" [...] in her YouTube account. Both became viral hits, with [...] "Gimme More" [...] gaining more than 300,000 views in two weeks. Shortly after, Digby became the eighth most subscribed-to artist on YouTube. She joked about the situation saying, [...] "I could have done a karaoke video to , but I just had my stripper pole taken out the other day from my living room, and it just wouldn't have been the same". The same year, Australian pop singer Sia released an acoustic version of the song. Swedish metal band Machinae Supremacy covered the song on their third studio album Overworld, released on February 13, 2008. Matthieu De Ronde of Archaic Magazine commented [...] " [...] one of the most unexpected covers of all time, [...] this track has been given a somewhat comical but enjoyable makeover, but who said that metal couldn’t be fun?". American singer-songwriter Christopher Dallman played a cover of the song during many of his concerts in 2007. Two years later, he showed his version to his producer Rachel Alina, who prompted him to release an EP of Spears's covers. The EP, titled Sad Britney, was released on November 9, 2009, and also contained covers of [...] "Radar", [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "...Baby One More Time". It became Dallman's first record to chart on iTunes. He also released a music video for [...] "Gimme More", which was criticized by Spears's fans who thought Dallman was making fun of her. He explained, [...] "There have been a few folks who have misinterpreted what I was doing and thought that I was somehow making fun of her, which really isn’t the case. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> place in my heart for Britney".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] was {{directed}} by Ray Kay and filmed inside a basement in Los Angeles, California. On March 17, 2011, Spears posted on her Twitter account, [...] "Day 1 of the #TTWE Videoshoot. Just wrapped my first big dance number. Taking a well deserved break people!" [...] She also tweeted {{a picture of her}} on set, wearing ripped tights, a Burberry Prorsum studded leather jacket and matching fingerless leather gloves. The making-of was chronicled on the special Britney Spears: I Am the Femme Fatale, which aired on MTV on April 3, 2011, at 21:00 EST (02:00 UTC). In the special, Spears is seen watching the playback, as she later explained, [...] " [...] just to make sure it's right and that the costume looks right and the dancers are together and we all look in unison. It's an energy and it looks fresh. It has a certain vibe with it and it makes sense." [...] She also went on to describe the set as [...] "grimy and gross [...] It was sweat and it was disgusting sometimes". At a point in the shoot, Spears changed her heels to Ugg boots during the shots that did not show her feet, stating that [...] " [...] hurts ... but it looks good. It wasn't a full-length shot, so a girl's about comfort when it's not showing." [...] Spears said that she did not feel the need to top herself, saying that [...] "I've made so many videos that I'm at the point that I genuinely want to enjoy myself, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> good team of people with me. [...] I had never worked with Ray Kay before. I was really happy with the work we did." [...] The video was choreographed by Brian Friedman. On April 4, 2011, it was announced that two different versions of the music video would be released, a director's cut and a choreography cut. The same day, Spears tweeted a 30-second preview of the video, announcing, [...] "#TillTheWorldEnds video premieres THIS Wednesday on VEVO. Cant wait to share it with you guys!" [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] became at the Spears second VEVOcertified music video on YouTube.|$|E
2500|$|Duterte has [...] "bragged {{about his}} Viagra-fuelled serial adultery", drawing {{criticism}} from the GABRIELA Women's Party. He told supporters {{at a rally in}} 2015: [...] "When I was young, I could do overnight, which is more expensive. When I got old, I could do short time only because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> short time left. After one erection, that’s it. No more. Without Viagra, it’s even more difficult." [...] Despite one of its representatives Luz Ilagan once stated that the people should focus on his track record and not on his womanizing ways, GABRIELA national chairperson Emmi de Jesus reiterated its stance against Duterte.|$|E

2500|$|... "Originally I {{had this}} idea {{that it should be}} {{possible}} to create some kind of community around this kind of work, and I think by muddying the titles – not having [...] "you are the composer, you are the arranger, you are the orchestrator" [...] – it just sort of helped us to work more collaboratively. It wasn't that important to me that I had [...] "score by Hans Zimmer" [...] and took sole credit on these things. It's like Gladiator: I gave Lisa Gerrard the co-credit because, even though she didn't write the main theme, her presence and contributions were very influential. She was more than just a soloist, and this is why <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> problem with specific credits." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “At first I had {{no desire}} to write screenplays. I kind of wished I had because I was {{reaching}} the end of my time producing music videos. I was struggling so hard {{to figure out what it}} was that I was supposed to be doing. I kept thinking I’m supposed to be doing something creative. I can’t believe <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> knack for the vernacular and I don’t have anywhere to apply it." [...] “I felt I had not found my true path. And then a series of events occurred that led me to the point where I didn’t have anything to lose if I wrote a screenplay." [...] She began writing sitcoms with a comedian friend but was plagued by second thoughts about her work. Khouri was frustrated and kept [...] "contemplating and meditating" [...] until she got this idea of [...] "two women going on a crime spree." [...] She felt as if a light bulb had gone on over her head, making her more interested in the idea.|$|E
