25|$|Common bells are {{mechanically}} struck, while MEMS resonators are electrically driven. There are two base technologies used {{to build}} MEMS resonators that differ in how electrical drive and sense signals are transduced from the mechanical motion. These are electrostatic and piezoelectric. All commercial MEMS oscillators use electrostatic transduction while MEMS filters use piezoelectric transduction. Piezoelectric resonators have not shown sufficient <b>frequency</b> <b>stability</b> or quality factor (Q) for frequency reference applications.|$|E
25|$|Six Block IIa {{satellites}} {{were launched}} in 1985–1986 with improved time and frequency standards over the prototypes, and increased <b>frequency</b> <b>stability.</b> These spacecraft also demonstrated a 16-month average operational lifetime.

The six spacecraft that made it to orbit worked well, operating {{for an average of}} nearly 22 months.|$|E
25|$|Frequency {{references}} generally require <b>frequency</b> <b>stabilities</b> of 100 {{parts per}} million (ppm) or better. However, the early cover and encapsulation technologies left significant amounts of contamination in the cavities. Because MEMS resonators are small, and particularly because they have small volume-to-surface area, they are especially sensitive to mass loading. Even single-atomic layers of contaminants like water or hydrocarbons can shift the resonator’s frequencies out of specification.|$|R
50|$|In {{the active}} {{hydrogen}} maser, the cavity oscillates by itself. This requires a higher hydrogen atom density {{and a higher}} quality factor for the cavity. However, with advanced microwave cavities made out of silver-plated ceramic, the gain factor can be much higher, thereby requiring less hydrogen atom density. The active maser is more complex and more expensive but has better short-term and long-term <b>frequency</b> <b>stabilities.</b>|$|R

25|$|Amateur Radio {{operators}} {{needed to}} modify their transmitters to allow for HF RTTY operation. This was accomplished by adding a frequency shift keyer that used a diode to switch a capacitor {{in and out of}} the circuit, shifting the transmitter’s frequency in synchronism with the teleprinter signal changing from mark to space to mark. A very stable transmitter was required for RTTY. The typical frequency multiplication type transmitter that was popular in the 1950s and 1960s would be relatively stable on 80 meters but become progressively less stable on 40 meters, 20 meters and 15 meters. By the middle 1960s, transmitter designs were updated, mixing a crystal-controlled high frequency oscillator with a variable low frequency oscillator, resulting in better <b>frequency</b> <b>stability</b> across all Amateur Radio HF bands.|$|E
25|$|Superheterodyne {{receivers}} {{have essentially}} replaced all previous receiver designs. The development of modern semiconductor electronics negated {{the advantages of}} designs (such as the regenerative receiver) that used fewer vacuum tubes. The superheterodyne receiver offers superior sensitivity, <b>frequency</b> <b>stability</b> and selectivity. Compared with the tuned radio frequency receiver (TRF) design, superhets offer better stability because a tuneable oscillator is more easily realized than a tuneable amplifier. Operating at a lower frequency, IF filters can give narrower passbands at the same Q factor than an equivalent RF filter. A fixed IF also allows {{the use of a}} crystal filter or similar technologies that cannot be tuned. Regenerative and super-regenerative receivers offered a high sensitivity, but often suffer from stability problems making them difficult to operate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{solution}} to this was the development of circuits which could generate multiple frequencies from a [...] "reference frequency" [...] produced by a crystal oscillator.

Tuning forks have quality factors around 1000. The quality factor of atomic clocks, superconducting RF cavities used in accelerators, and some high-Q lasers can reach as high as 1011 and higher.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, {{the term}} [...] "coarse {{wavelength}} division multiplexing" [...] was fairly generic, and meant {{a number of}} different things. In general, these things shared the fact that the choice of channel spacings and <b>frequency</b> <b>stability</b> was such that erbium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) could not be utilized. Prior to the relatively recent ITU standardization of the term, one common meaning for coarse WDM meant two (or possibly more) signals multiplexed onto a single fiber, where one signal was in the 1550nm band, and the other in the 1310nm band.|$|E
2500|$|A well-thought-out design {{procedure}} {{is considered to}} be the first significant step to a successful synthesizer project. In the system design of a frequency synthesizer, states Manassewitsch, there are as many [...] "best" [...] design procedures as there are experienced synthesizer designers. System analysis of a frequency synthesizer involves output frequency range (or frequency bandwidth or tuning range), frequency increments (or resolution or frequency tuning), <b>frequency</b> <b>stability</b> (or phase stability, compare spurious outputs), phase noise performance (e.g., spectral purity), switching time (compare settling time and rise time), and size, power consumption, and cost. James A. Crawford says that these are mutually contradictive requirements.|$|E
