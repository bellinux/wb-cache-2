5|$|Saint Augustine {{offered a}} version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as {{the pursuit of the}} supreme good, which {{delivers}} human happiness. He argued that to achieve this happiness, humans must love objects that are worthy of human love <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> manner; this requires humans to love God, which then allows them to correctly love that which is worthy of being loved. Augustine's ethics proposed that the act of loving God enables humans to properly orient their loves, leading to human happiness and fulfilment. Augustine supported Plato's view that a well-ordered soul is a desirable consequence of morality. However, unlike Plato, he believed that achieving a well-ordered soul had a higher purpose: living in accordance with God's commands. His view of morality was thus heteronomous, as he believed in deference to a higher authority (God), rather than acting autonomously.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{molecular}} cues involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> targeting of the migrating precursors remains a question. The secretion of a chemoattractant factor by the OB appears as a possibility. Chemoattractants and repellants act on the migrating neurons by inducing changes in the growth cone to direct them. Nevertheless, tissue derived from this structure had no directive influence on the migration. On the other hand, a septum-derived secreted factor showed a repulsive effect on the SVZ cells. More recently, {{it has been shown}} that the secreted molecule SLIT shows such a repelling effect on SVZ-derived precursors. Furthermore, integrins have been demonstrated to have a regulatory influence on precursor cell chain-migration and regulation of their divisions.|$|E
40|$|Navigator echoes {{provide a}} means with which to remove motion {{artifacts}} from diffusion-weighted images obtained using any multishot imaging technique. However, residual motion artifact is often present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corrected</b> images rendering <b>the</b> technique unreliable. It is shown that velocity-compensated diffusion sensitization when used in tandem with a navigator echo further reduces the degree of residual motion artifacts present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>corrected</b> images and improves the reliability and clinical utility of the technique. This is demonstrated by applying a method for quantification of motion artifact to brain images of healthy volunteers scanned using both conventional (Stejskal-Tanner) and velocity-compensated gradient sensitization. Other factors affecting {{the efficacy of the}} navigator echo technique, such as brain pulsatile motion, gradient b factor, and navigator echo signal-to-noise ratio, are also discussed...|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{inheritable}} {{nature of}} coats of arms the College {{have also been}} involved in genealogy since the 15th century. The College regularly conduct genealogical research for individuals with families in the British Isles of all social classes. As the College is also the official repository of genealogical materials such as pedigree charts and family trees. The College's extensive records within this realm of study dates back over five centuries. An individual could, if he so wishes, have his family's pedigree placed inside the College's records. This would require the services of {{an officer of the}} College who would then draft a pedigree. The officer would ensure that the pedigree was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> format and also advise the client on the documentary evidences necessary to supports such a draft. After this is done, the officer would submit the pedigree to a chapter of two other officers, who would then examine the pedigree for any mistakes or in some cases demand more research. After this examination is completed the pedigree would then be scrivened and placed into the pedigree register of the College.|$|E
5|$|Max Weber was {{a pioneer}} in {{delineating}} a connection between capitalism and exceptionalism. In earlier texts, Maximiliano Korstanje explores the American exceptionalism {{and its effects on}} the current means of productions. This contribution to the existent literature is of paramount importance because of two main reasons. The first and most important, he relates capitalism to Protestantism. This is of course nothing new, since Max Weber did it in the past. However, Korstanje adds, though Weber was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> side by confirming the connection of Reform and Capitalism, the key role played by Norse Mythology was left behind. In effect, the concept of predestination as it has been discussed by Weber did not come from Luther alone. It was rather enrooted in the core of Norse Culture. Secondly, this impossibility to understand the future led to English speaking societies to construct a risk-prone culture, which resulted in what Ulrich Beck dubbed the “Risk Society”. The criticism exerted in the uneven distribution of Capitalism should be explained by the “economy of salved peoples” formulated by Weber.|$|E
5|$|Morsell {{found it}} {{challenging}} to film a scene {{near the end}} of the game, in which Adrienne is pleading with Don while getting strapped into the chair with a guillotine overhead. Several different versions of the scene had to be filmed, and Morsell said it was difficult for her to work up the genuine emotion she needed take after take. The torture devices featured in the game were scale models made by local craftsmen. During one scene, the mansion roof starts to collapse, causing beams and chunks of debris to fall around the actors. To achieve this, the crew built lightweight beams out of hollow cardboard, which had to fall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> sequence. In another scene, Adrienne crawls along a water pipe that breaks. To film the scene without damaging equipment, the crew built a giant plastic box with a plastic tray underneath for the shoot. Three hoses ran through the pipe so water would spray in multiple directions.|$|E

5|$|The 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade {{carried out}} a brigade-sized {{parachute}} landing during Operation Dragoon. On 15 August 1944 the brigade's pathfinders landed {{in the south of}} France and set up Eureka beacons to guide the main brigade force to their drop zones. Despite the pathfinders' success at marking the drop zones, only seventy-three planes placed their parachutists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> location. The brigade commanding officer and eighty men were landed near Fayence, as were the 5th (Scottish) Battalion's commanding officer, with half of battalion headquarters, 'C' Company, and 'D' Company. Other men were landed as far away as Cannes. The dispersed landings resulted in only about forty percent of the 4th Battalion making it to the brigade forming-up point. Only seventy percent of the 6th (Welch) Battalion and only a single company of the 5th (Scottish) Battalion had arrived. The brigade headquarters was established at Le Mitan with the 5th (Scottish) Battalion company by 04:00, and by 07:30 the 4thBattalion had occupied the heights at Le Muy. The 6th (Welch) Battalion occupied La Motte and, when the Germans at Clastron surrendered, moved a company into the village. Le Serres was captured by 'C' Company, 4th Battalion, as was the bridge over the River Naturby on the road to Le Muy.|$|E

It also provided instructions for performing the ritual dry ablution (tayammum) when ritually pure water was not available, to replace the ritual ablution (wudu) that is ordinarily required before performing the salat. When tayammum was not possible, even making slight pointing motions with hands or face toward clean earth, stone, or tree was acceptable.|$|E
5|$|The {{mammalian}} {{heart has}} four chambers, two upper atria, the receiving chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The heart has four valves, which separate its chambers and ensures blood flows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>correct</b> direction {{through the heart}} (preventing backflow). After gas exchange in the pulmonary capillaries (blood vessels in the lungs), oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium via {{one of the four}} pulmonary veins. Blood flows nearly continuously back into the atrium, which acts as the receiving chamber, and from here through an opening into the left ventricle. Most blood flows passively into the heart while both the atria and ventricles are relaxed, but {{toward the end of the}} ventricular relaxation period, the left atrium will contract, pumping blood into the ventricle. The heart also requires nutrients and oxygen found in blood like other muscles, and is supplied via coronary arteries.|$|E
