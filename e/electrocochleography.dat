40|$|To improve <b>electrocochleography's</b> {{diagnostic}} sensitivity in Meniére's disease - new assessment methods are being studied. AIM: To {{determine whether or}} not graphic angle measurement is sensitive and specific to Menière's disease laboratorial diagnosis and if there is an increase in the <b>electrocochleography's</b> sensitivity and specificity when graphic angle measurements are associated with Summating Potential-Action Potential ratio (SP/AP ratio). METHODS: <b>Electrocochleography's</b> was used to analyze 71 ears from 55 subjects: 41 patients with clinical diagnosis of Menière's disease (MD group), and 14 healthy individuals as control (Group C). Graphic results were analyzed initially to obtain the SP/AP ratio; afterwards, through another program graphic angle measurements were calculated. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity values of angle measures, SP/AP ratio, and the association between them varied according to the cutoff point, the highest equilibrium between sensitivity and specificity was observed with the values of 166. 25 for angle measurement and 27 % for SP/AP relation; 62. 79 % / 60. 71 % and 74. 42 % / 67. 86 %, respectively. The association between measurements showed a sensitivity increase due to the specificity decrease; 88. 37 % and 50 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: Angle graphic measurement is not sensitive and specific enough for the laboratorial diagnosis of MD.

40|$|Background and Aim: It is {{not known}} how <b>electrocochleography</b> {{components}} of action potentials (AP) and summating potentials (SP) are changed in response to CE-chirp stimulus using extra-tympanic electrodes. This study was done for comparing summating potentials and action potentials specifications in response to CE-chirp and click stimuli. Methods: <b>Electrocochleography</b> components of action potentials and summating potentials were recorded in 16 normal hearing subjects (8 men and 8 women) aged 22 - 30 years (mean: 26. 7 with SD 2. 5 years) with audiometric (250 - 8000 Hz) hearing thresholds of 15 dB HL or better in response to click and CE-chirp stimulus at 90 dB nHL. Amplitude, duration, latency and area of summating potentials and action potentials and SP/AP amplitude and area ratios were compared. Results: Among the measured parameters, action potentials amplitude in response to CE-chirp stimulus (0. 41 with SD 0. 26 µV) was significantly smaller than action potentials amplitude in response to click (0. 61 with SD 0. 29 µV) stimulus (p< 0. 005). Relative frequency of detecting summating potentials in response to CE-chirp (68. 7 %) was lower than (100 %) click (p< 0. 005). Conclusion: Recording <b>electrocochleography</b> component of summating potentials and action potentials with CE-chirp stimulus at high intensity level in normal hearing individuals shows no advantage over click stimulus.

40|$|Current {{methods of}} objectively {{measuring}} hearing thresholds at frequencies below 1000 Hz {{are not as}} accurate, or effective as obtaining hearing thresholds from the higher frequencies. The auditory nerve overlapped waveform (ANOW) was developed to allow accurate assessment of frequencies below 1000 Hz from {{the production of the}} cochlear microphonic, to develop a method of objective measure of low frequency hearing threshold. In the current evidence base, no one has yet successfully measured the ANOW in humans. This study aimed to produce the ANOW in humans to develop it as an objective measure of hearing threshold. We subjectively measured participant’s thresholds using both pure tone audiometry and <b>electrocochleography.</b> The participants were all suspected of having Ménière’s disease, and were undergoing transtympanic <b>electrocochleography.</b> We then used the <b>electrocochleography</b> needle to record our auditory responses. From these responses we derived the ANOW. Comparing the data analysed to the audiograms of the participants, we cannot conclude at this stage that the ANOW that we measured was purely neural from the apex of the cochlea in origin. The sound levels at which testing took place generally exceeded those levels which guaranteed that the ANOW waveforms recorded were purely neural in origin. From this, future studies in this area will involve stacked derived band masking to show frequency specificity and neural origin of the recordings. As such, the current results were not able to accurately predict participant thresholds. However this study has further advanced the technique of utilising the ANOW as an objective measure of low frequency hearing, to the benefit of future studies...|$|E

40|$|An {{objective}} {{method for}} the pre-operative diagnosis and the post-operative {{assessment of a}} presumed perilymphatic fistula (PLF) using transtympanic <b>electrocochleography</b> is presented. Three cases are reported in which {{the history of the}} disease and the symptoms strongly suggested the presence of a PLF. Pre-operative transtympanic <b>electrocochleography</b> (TT ECoG) recordings at rest showed changes similar to those of endolymphatic hydrops and signs of instability of the inner ear hydrodynamic system during raised intrathoracic pressure. Surgery revealed a visible leak in two of the three cases. Both windows were repaired in all the patients. All patients were relieved from their vestibular symptoms at the time when the post-operative TT ECoG was conducted 3 - 6 months later. The post-operative recordings were stable during raised intrathoracic pressure and the previously elevated summating potentials decreased which was interpreted as an objective indication of the recovery of the hydrodynamic system. However, later one of the patients again developed recurrent vertigo. Twenty patients with well-documented Ménière's disease were used as a control group. TT ECoG was conducted during raised intrathoracic pressure. The Ménière patients showed stable recordings.

40|$|Exposure {{to organic}} {{solvents}} {{has been shown}} to be ototoxic in animals and there is evidence that these solvents can induce hearing loss in humans. In this study, the effects of inhalation of the possibly ototoxic solvent ethyl benzene on the cochlear function and morphology were evaluated using three complementary techniques: (1) reflex modification audiometry (RMA), (2) <b>electrocochleography</b> and (3) histological examination of the cochleas. Rats were exposed to either ethyl benzene (800 ppm, 8 h/day for 5 days) or to control conditions. The RMA threshold increased significantly by about 25 dB, 1 and 4 weeks after the exposure, irrespective of the stimulus frequency tested (4 - 24 kHz). <b>Electrocochleography</b> was performed between 8 and 11 weeks after exposure to the organic solvent. The threshold for the compound action potential increased significantly by 10 - 30 dB at all frequencies tested (1 - 24 kHz). Histological examination of the cochlea showed outer hair cell (OHC) loss, especially in the upper basal and lower middle turns (corresponding to the mid-frequency region) to an extent of 65 %.

40|$|In the {{assessment}} of hearing threshold in children, ABR reliability is greatly reduced {{in the presence of}} altered synchrony or brainstem generator dysfunction, while <b>electrocochleography</b> (ECochG) still provides a reliable threshold evaluation. This study is drawn from a retrospective analysis performed in 459 children submitted to ECochG and ABR recordings with the aim of comparing the reliability of the two procedures in hearing threshold estimation. Transtympanic ECochG and ABR were recorded under general anesthesia in response to 0. 1 ms clicks at decreasing intensities from 90 dB nHL. In 98 % of the ears threshold estimates for ECochG compared to ABR recordings were lower (50 %) or equal (47 %). In 77 % of the ears these differences were found within 20 dB. In this group the percentage occurrence of ears in subjects affected by CNS pathology or bearing a neonatal risk factor for hearing loss was 40 %; in the remaining 20 % of the ears, where threshold differences were higher than 20 dB, the percentage was 17 %. It can be concluded that, when dealing with children presenting a CNS dysfunction, <b>electrocochleography</b> is the only reliable diagnostic tool in hearing threshold estimation because of low ABR reliability, possibly related to an altered synchrony in brainstem generator...|$|E
40|$|SummaryMénière’s {{disease is}} a {{frequent}} vestibular disease that occurs predominantly in the fourth decade of life. Diagnosis is mostly medical {{and is based on}} findings of vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus and aural fullness. Aim: To study the clinical findings of Ménière’s disease: age, duration of vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss and aural fullness, and unilateral or bilateral involvement. Method: a retrospective study included 39 patients with a diagnosis of Ménière’s disease confirmed by <b>electrocochleography,</b> who were seen at a neuro-otology referral centre. Patients underwent a clinical examination, audiometry and bilateral transtympanic <b>electrocochleography.</b> Patients were separated into 2 groups: bilateral Ménière’s disease and unilateral Ménière’s disease. Results: The mean age was 42. 9 years; 72. 5 % were female. Fluctuation of hearing loss occurred in 54. 5 % of cases, and 65. 7 % had frequent attacks of vertigo. Bilateral disease was observed in 33. 3 %. The onset of the disease was earlier in the bilateral group (33. 7 years) compared to the unilateral group (p= 0. 0013).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} vestibular abnormalities {{in subjects}} with Waardenburg syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective record review. SETTING: Tertiary referral neurotology clinic. SUBJECTS: Twenty-two adult white subjects with clinical diagnosis of Waardenburg syndrome (10 type I and 12 type II). INTERVENTIONS: Evaluation for Waardenburg phenotype, history of vestibular and auditory symptoms, tests of vestibular and auditory function. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of phenotyping, results of vestibular and auditory symptom review (history), results of vestibular and auditory function testing. RESULTS: Seventeen subjects were women, and 5 were men. Their ages ranged from 21 to 58 years (mean, 38 years). Sixteen of the 22 subjects sought treatment for vertigo, dizziness, or imbalance. For subjects with vestibular symptoms, the results of vestibuloocular tests (calorics, vestibular autorotation, and/or pseudorandom rotation) were abnormal in 77 %, {{and the results of}} vestibulospinal function tests (computerized dynamic posturography, EquiTest) were abnormal in 57 %, but there were no specific patterns of abnormality. Six had objective sensorineural hearing loss. Thirteen had an elevated summating/action potential (> 0. 40) on <b>electrocochleography.</b> All subjects except those with severe hearing loss (n = 3) had normal auditory brainstem response results.

40|$|During {{vestibular}} schwannoma surgery a {{large proportion}} of patients will lose their hearing. While there have been several papers investigating the mechanism behind this loss of auditory function, the exact pathophysiological mechanisms remain relatively elusive. The present study aimed to document the patterns of electrophysiological auditory responses during retrosigmoid vestibular schwannoma surgery. In particular, we aimed to determine whether the site of auditory impairment in individual cases was predominantly cochlea or neural. Auditory function was monitored intraoperatively in two patients who underwent unilateral vestibular schwannoma surgery via the retrosigmoid approach at St George’s Hospital in Christchurch, and Dunedin Public Hospital. A combination of <b>electrocochleography</b> and direct eighth nerve monitoring techniques were used to monitor the auditory evoked potentials from the cochlea and cochlear nerve {{during the course of the}} surgery. Auditory brainstem response recordings were obtained from the second participant due to the technical difficulties in the primary electrophysiological techniques. Technical difficulties faced during the surgical procedure prevented the recording of both <b>electrocochleography</b> and direct eighth nerve monitoring potentials from each of the participants. As a consequence of this, we were unable to draw any conclusions about the site of iatrogenic injury in each surgery.

40|$|The {{technique}} of transtympanic <b>electrocochleography</b> was initially developed as an objective hearing threshold test by Eggermont. Gibson et al. (1977) claimed that an enlarged {{direct current component}} of the action potential (AP) called the summating potential (SP) {{is an indication of}} endolymphatic hydrops, later confirmed by Coates who proposed an SP/AP ratio measure. This led to numerous publications using diagnostic ratios of 0. 33 – 0. 35. The insensitivity led to an eventual disenchantment with the test as a reliable objective test for Meniere's disease. It was further confused by audiologists employing remote canal or ear drum electrodes which give a response about one-fourth of the magnitude obtained by an electrode in contact with the cochlea. Subsequently Gibson stated that an SP/AP ratio of < 0. 5 is not diagnostic for hydrops. He then showed that a tone burst stimulus gave the test a significantly higher sensitivity and specificity, which has been supported by others. On MRI inner ear imaging with gadolinium hydrops can be seen, but the quality of images and what is seen may vary according to brand of scanner, settings, mode of gadolinium administration, and the possibility that gadolinium entry may favor the vestibule.

40|$|Transtympanic <b>electrocochleography</b> {{has been}} used to measure the action {{potential}} (AP), summating potential (SP), and cochlear microphonic (CM) in patients with Menière's disease. In this condition the widening of the AP/SP complex is thought to be due to an enhanced negative SP which shows no adaptation and this {{may be the result of}} an increased asymmetry produced by endolymphatic hydrops. Measurements have also been made using two groups of agents [...] those designed to increase the cochlear blood flow (the metabolic activator naftidrofuryl and inhalations of carbon dioxide) and those designed to reduce the hydrops "osmotically" (glycerol) or by diuresis. It was hoped that the "glycerol dehydration test" when assessed electrocochleographically would lead to a better selection of patients for surgical decompression of the saccus endolymphaticus. It was also hoped that it would lead to a fuller understanding of the electrophysiological changes which occur in Menière's disease. While it appeared that a decrease in the negative SP after glycerol may be a more sensitive indicator of the changes within the cochlea than either pure-tone audiometry or speech discrimination, no clearcut correlations between this change and the surgical result could be demonstrated. In many patients the AP/SP waveform remained unchanged after successful surgery, indicating perhaps that the pathological changes may have been checked but not reversed, while the hearing remained "pegged" at its preoperative level. <b>Electrocochleography</b> during operation failed to show any consistent change in the waveform or CM...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the action of a nos ii inhibitor on dpoae and <b>electrocochleography</b> in experimental endolymphatic hydrops. Material and methods: endolymphatic hydrops was induced in 16 guinea pigs by obliterating the endolymphatic duct and sac in the right ear. They were divided in two groups: eigth guinea pigs under the action of aminoguanidine, a nos ii inhibitor and eigth control guinea pigs. We compared dpoae amplitudes at geometric means of frequencies 1062, 2187, 4375 and 7000 hz, compound action potential threshold at 1000, 2000, 4000 and 6000 hz and summating potential to action potential (sp/ap) ratio between the groups during the postoperative observation period of 16 weeks. Results: there were no significant changes in the dpoae amplitudes and in the sp/ap ratio. The group that received aminoguanidine had a lower degree of threshold increase at 2000 (p< 0. 05) And 6000 hz (p< 0. 05) In 12 th postoperative week and at 1000 (p< 0. 05), 2000 (P< 0. 001), 4000 (P< 0. 001) And 6000 hz (p< 0. 001) At 16 th postoperative week.
