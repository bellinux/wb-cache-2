40|$|We {{consider}} whether techniques from concurrency theory {{can be applied}} {{in the area of}} Cognitive Neuroscience. We focus on two potential applications. The first of these explores structural decomposition, which is effectively assumed by the localisation of function metaphor that so dominates current Cognitive Neuroscience. We take concurrency theory methods, especially Process Calculi, as canonical illustrations of system description notations that support structural decomposition and, in particular, encapsulation of behaviour. We argue that carrying these behavioural and notational properties over to the Cognitive Neuroscience setting is difficult, since neural networks (the modelling method of choice) are not naturally <b>encapsulable.</b> Our second application presents work on verifying stability properties of neural network learning algorithms using model checking. We thereby present evidence that a particular learning algorithm, the Generalised Recirculation algorithm, exhibits an especially severe form of instability, whereby it forgets what it has learnt, while continuing to be trained on the same pattern set...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{effects and}} {{effectiveness}} of the chaperone pair GroELS on the yield and quality of recombinant polypeptides produced in Escherichia coli are matter of controversy, as the reported activities of this complex are not always consistent and eventually indicate undesired side effects. The divergence in the reported data could be due, at least partially, to different experimental conditions in independent research approaches. Results We have then selected two structurally different model proteins (namely GFP and E. coli Î²-galactosidase) and two derived aggregation-prone fusions to explore, in a systematic way, the eventual effects of GroELS co-production on yield, solubility and conformational quality. Host cells were cultured at two alternative temperatures below the threshold at which thermal stress {{is expected to be}} triggered, to minimize the involvement of independent stress factors. Conclusions From the analysis of protein yield, solubility and biological activity of the four model proteins produced alone or along the chaperones, we conclude that GroELS impacts on yield and quality of aggregation-prone proteins with intrinsic determinants but not on thermally induced protein aggregation. No effective modifications of protein solubility have been observed, but significant stabilization of small (<b>encapsulable)</b> substrates and moderate chaperone-induced degradation of larger (excluded) polypeptides. These findings indicate that the activities of this chaperone pair in the context of actively producing recombinant bacteria discriminate between intrinsic and thermally-induced protein aggregation, and that the side effects of GroELS overproduction might be determined by substrate size. </p...|$|E
40|$|Cloricromene (AD 6), an anti-ischemic drug, {{is rapidly}} metabolised into {{a stable and}} active {{metabolite}} (cloricromene acid, AD 6 -acid) poorly soluble in water and less lipophilic than cloricromene. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate which of the two forms has more possibility to be efficiently encapsulated in nanoparticles based on poly(D,L-lactide) and prepared using the nanoprecipitation method. Increasing the theoretical loading of AD 6, an increase in drug actual loading and in the mean particle size occurred, while no formation of nanoparticles was observed when the highest theoretical loading (50 mg) was employed. Changing the pH of the aqueous phase the drug content dramatically increased. However, at a pH value of I I a more rapid hydrolysis of AD 6 occurred. When AD 6 -acid was embedded in the nanoparticles, suitable results concerning both drug content and encapsulation efficiency were achieved. A good control in the release of AD 6 from the AD 6 -loaded nanoparticles was observed while the liberation of AD 6 -acid from the AD 6 -acid-loaded nanoparticles was faster than the dissolution of the AD 6 -acid free. These results confirm that the most easy <b>encapsulable</b> form in nanoparticles is AD 6 -acid probably owing to its poor water solubility. Further studies will be carried out in order to evaluate if the increase in the liberation of AD 6 -acid by nanoencapsulation may have outcomes in its bioavaibility in vivo...|$|E
