40|$|The French five-point {{bending test}} (5 PBT) {{provides}} a laboratory scale test that allows studying the fatigue resistance of surfacing systems on orthotropic steel deck bridges (OSDB). The surfacing structure for OSDB in the Netherlands consists mostly of multilayer system: top porous asphalt layer, <b>guss</b> <b>asphalt</b> layer, steel deck and two membrane layers. In this paper, an analytical solution for 5 PBT setup is presented first. In {{order to better}} understand the influence of geometrical, mechanical and structural parameters on the performance of the typical multilayer surfacing system of OSDB in the Netherlands, the 5 PBT specimens with five structural layers have been investigated. The parametric study is performed at the numerical platform CAPA- 3 D that was developed at the Section of Structural Mechanics of TU Delft. The thicknesses of the top porous asphalt layer, middle <b>guss</b> <b>asphalt</b> layer and the steel plate are varied. The influences of the mechanical properties of both top and bottom membrane layers are studied. The sensitivities of those influence factors are evaluated by the examination of the maximum tensile stress at the top surface of the porous asphalt layers and the strain distributions through the entire thickness of the specimen at two cross sections.

40|$|Due to {{lightweight}} and flexibility, orthotropic steel deck bridges become popular {{the last decades}} but several problems were reported in relation to asphalt surfacing materials such as rutting, cracking, loss of bond between the surfacing system and steel deck. In the Netherlands a surfacing structure for orthotropic steel bridge decks mostly consists of five structural layers: top porous asphalt layer, <b>guss</b> <b>asphalt</b> layer, steel deck and two membrane layers. The five-point bending fatigue test is the standard device in France for asphalt concrete used on steel orthotropic deck bridges to perform the best asphalt mixture having a strong resistance to cracking. For the needs of this paper the 5 PBT was employed in order to evaluate {{the performance of the}} whole multilayer structure on steel deck and also to evaluate the mechanical properties of both top and bottom membrane and the influence they have on the structure. For the completion of the experimental investigation two types of specimen have been tested using the 5 PBT set up. Displacement sensors have been used in order to detect the initiation of cracks where they are most likely to appear. Strain gauges have been used in order to monitor significant changes in strain on the <b>Guss</b> <b>asphalt</b> layer during the fatigue tests. Shear displacements between the asphalt layers are monitored and presented. It shows that the stiffness and the bonding characteristics of the intermediate membrane sheet as well as the wearing course behaviour seem to have great influence on the mechanical response of multilayer bridge surfacing system.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to provide an insight into a new composite bonding system of Cement/emulsified-Asphalt/Epoxy resin (CAE) for steel box girder bridge pavement. The effect of epoxy resin on emulsified asphalt mixtures added with cement has been investigated in laboratory. Besides the mechanical properties of mixtures using CAE binders, the microscopic feature of CAE binders also have been measured. The results of mechanical tests indicate good performances for pavement, especially rutting deformation at high temperature and adhesive strength with steel blocks. Then, microscopic images show some interesting microscopic feature, which could be related to the development of performances. 1 Foreword There are two remarkable characteristics for steel box girder bridge: temperature conductibility and deformation during temperature or traffic loading. Both of them are the big challenge for the pavement materials on steel box girder bridge decks. Because, they have resulted in hotspot and movement for pavement materials on the deck. <b>Guss</b> <b>Asphalt</b> Pavement and Epoxy Asphalt Pavement are two typical types of surfacing layer for steel box girder bridge decks abroad. However, due to the high bitumen content, itâ€™s hard to avoid rutting deformation of GA pavement. And ther...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} research into surfacings of orthotropic steel bridge decks. The motive {{for this research}} is the frequently reported problems {{of this type of}} structures including cracking and rutting of surfacing materials and fatigue related cracks in the steel plate. An intensive experimental program was carried out on three wearing course materials, namely mastic asphalt, <b>guss</b> <b>asphalt</b> and an open synthetic material. The program also included on a bituminous based membrane material. The results of the experimental program were analysed to characterise the complex mechanical behaviour of the different materials. Within the framework of this research, models that describe the response of the surfacing materials were developed, including a newly developed unified model that describes the time-temperature characteristics of many road materials. Furthermore, constitutive relations for elastic as well as inelastic response of the materials were developed. All the developed models were implemented in the Finite Element System CAPA- 3 D. For verification of the different models results of laboratory tests and full-scale experiments in the LINTRACK APT facility were used. Furthermore, a scientific approach in which the non-linear response of the materials, the geometry and the load are well presented, was used to give an insight into the interaction between the different components of the structure and the vehicle at different temperatures. Because this scientific approach is too sophisticated and expensive for routine analyses and design of the structure, a practical design concept is proposed. In this concept, the geometry and the load are well presented, but the material behaviour is simplifie...|$|E
40|$|In the Netherlands asphaltic surfacings on {{orthotropic}} {{steel deck}} bridges (OSDB) mostly consist of two structural layers. The upper layer consists {{of what is}} known as very open porous asphalt (ZOAB) for noise reduction. For the lower layer <b>Guss</b> <b>Asphalt</b> (GA) is used. Earlier investigations have shown that the bonding characteristics of membrane layers to the surrounding materials have a very strong influence on the overall response of the steel bridge decks. Rijkswaterstaat, an agency of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment, has commissioned Delft University of Technology to investigate and rank the performance of various commercially available membranes. In order to obtain insight into the response of membranes and their interaction with the surrounding materials on orthotropic steel decks, a project of evaluation of the performance of modern surfacing systems on OSDBs has been undertaken. Currently, there are various kinds of membranes provided by various companies. Thereby it was necessary to examine the bonding strength of these membrane products and to develop a ranking methodology. The research project focused on membrane performance and the effects hereof on the bridge deck as a whole. The methodology used was a multi-phase approach, which consisted of three main phases. In Phase 1, a Membrane Adhesion Test (MAT) device was developed at Delft University of Technology for the characterization of the adhesive bonding strength of membranes with the surrounding materials on OSDBs {{on the basis of a}} fundamentally sound, mechanistic methodology. Several membrane products were tested monotonically in this phase. In Phase 2, the MAT device was utilised for investigation of the fatigue response of the various membrane products on various substrates and under two different temperature conditions and three different cyclic load levels. A ranking methodology consisting of a combination of experimental (via MAT) and computational investigations was also developed and utilized for the ranking of the various membrane products. In Phase 3 of the project, four typical Dutch multilayer surfacing systems, constructed with five selected membrane products from Phase 1 and 2, were studied by means of five-point bending (5 PB) beam tests and FE simulations. The findings of the 5 PB beam tests were used for calibration and validation of the finite element predictions and for further ranking of the performance of the various membranes in Dutch OSDBs. On the basis of the project results, the top two ranking membranes were selected for subsequent testing by means of the LINTRACK facility available at Delft University of Technology.

40|$|Orthotropic steel decks {{are widely}} {{utilized}} in long span bridges, movable bridges and shorter span road and rail bridges {{due to their}} favourable properties. These properties are low deadweight, large plastic reserves in case of overload and aesthetic advantages. Nowadays, more than 1000 orthotropic steel deck bridges (OSDBs) have been built in Europe, out of which 86 are in The Netherlands. Asphalt concrete surfacing structures have distinct advantages when compared to alternative surfacing structures: fast installation, good driving comfort, low noise levels, and relatively cheap construction costs. In the Netherlands, an asphaltic surfacing structure mostly consists of two structural layers. The upper layer consists of porous asphalt for noise reduction. For the lower layer <b>guss</b> <b>asphalt</b> is used. In the last three decades, several problems were reported in relation to asphalt surfacing materials on OSDBs such as rutting, cracking, loss of bond between the surfacing system and the steel deck. The severity {{of the problems is}} enhanced by the considerable increase in traffic in terms of number of trucks, heavier wheel loads, wide-base tires etc. Over the years, the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management (RWS) in the Netherlands is facing a growing challenge in maintaining network capacity. Even though the combined length of OSDBs in the primary road network is limited, the consequences of repairs of the steel deck plate or the overlaying surfacing structure to network capacity are dramatic. Unfortunately the service life of asphaltic surfacing structures on OSDBs is limited to an average of 5 years. Thus, improvements of the performance of asphaltic surfacing structures on OSDBs are of the utmost importance. Preliminary investigations have shown that the adhesive strength of the membrane between the surfacing layers and the decks of steel bridges has a strong influence on the structural response of OSDBs. The most important requirement for the application of membrane materials in OSDBs is that the membrane adhesive layer shall be able sufficiently bond the surrounding materials to each other, thus ensuring the structural integrity of the deck. This research project aimed at evaluating the performance of multilayer surfacing systems on steel deck bridges and prolonging the service life. Focus was on membrane performance and the effects hereof on the structure as a whole. The methodology used in this research was a multi-phase approach, which consisted of three study phases at different scales: 1) material scale, 2 ?section scale and 3) bridge scale. In Phase 1 of this study, a Membrane Adhesion Test (MAT) device was developed at Delft University of Technology for the characterization of the adhesive bonding strength of membranes with the surrounding materials on OSDBs. An adhesive contact interface element developed within the FE package CAPA- 3 D was utilized for simulating the process of debonding or delamination of membranes from the surrounding materials. A methodology of evaluating membrane products on various substrates by computational and experimental investigations was set up. Several qualified membrane products were chosen for further investigations in Phase 2 and 3. In Phase 2 of the project, four typical Dutch multilayer surfacing systems constructed with the five selected membrane products from Phase 1 were studied by means of five-point bending (5 PB) beam tests and FE simulations. The findings of the 5 PB beam tests will help for the verification and calibration of the finite element predictions and for the further ranking of the best performance of the multilayer surfacing systems for Dutch OSDBs. In order to study the influence of the geometrical and structural parameters on the performance of the multilayer surfacing system, finite element simulations of 5 PB beam tests were performed. Parametric studies were performed by means of the finite element system CAPA- 3 D. The contributions to the overall system response of the mechanical properties of all the surfacing layers were studied. In the last stage of the work, Phase 3, finite element (FE) simulations of the Merwede Bridge subjected to dual wheel stationary and moving loads are presented. Three cases of load locations have been investigated. All cases were simulated under and respectively. Four different surfacing structures as utilized in the 5 PB beam tests were chosen for the FE simulations. The results of the simulations provide a useful guidance regarding the expected maximum strains in the four surfacing structures for two different temperatures. Through those three research stages, a systematic and effective bottom-to-top design approach of multilayer surfacing systems for OSDBs has been established.
