40|$|The enzyme NADH oxidase (EC 1. 6. 99. 3) {{has been}} {{isolated}} from the two thermoacidophilic archaea Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and Sulfolobus solfataricus and characterized. In both organisms the enzyme oxidizes specifically beta-NADH {{in the presence of}} molecular oxygen and requires the presence of a flavin cofactor, showing a high specificity for FAD. A stoicheiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide to NADH is formed as the end product of the reaction, indicating that both enzymes are two-electron donors. The purified enzymes exhibit quite different molecular properties, <b>S.</b> acidocaldarius NADH <b>oxidase</b> is a monomeric protein with an estimated molecular mass of about 27 kDa, whereas <b>S.</b> solfataricus NADH <b>oxidase</b> is a dimeric protein with a molecular mass of 35 kDa per subunit; <b>S.</b> solfataricus NADH <b>oxidase</b> is purified as an FAD-containing protein, whereas <b>S.</b> acidocaldarius NADH <b>oxidase</b> does not contain a flavin molecule. Furthermore, a comparison of the N-terminal amino acid sequence shows no similarities either between the two proteins or to any other NADH oxidases. Both enzymes are essentially thermophilic. In the temperature range 20 - 80 degrees C, the energy of activation is almost the same for both activities, suggesting that similar energetic parameters are required.

Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the project was to examine changes in {{physical}} activity, self-efficacy, and program satisfaction for participants of the EIM Referral Program. Methods: As part of the EIM referral Program at Slippery Rock University, students utilizing the Student Health Center were screened by a nurse practitioner for a “sixth vital sign”, which was reported as frequency and duration of physical activity (PA) per week. Students reporting fewer than 150 minutes of PA per week were eligible for referral to a senior Exercise Science Intern. At the beginning of the program, the Exercise Science Intern provided participants with motivational interviewing and coaching to create goals and initiate behavior change. Participants completed pre and post fitness assessments and six weeks of individualized exercise prescription, meeting with the Exercise Science Intern twice per week. At the end of the program, participants completed a confidential program evaluation. Results: Twenty participants (age = 24. 55 + 12. 61; 4 males, 16 females) who had no regular exercise program completed the intervention. Two non-traditional participants referred through their physician were included in the data. There was 85 % program compliance among participants within the six week timeframe.

In this paper we attempted to clarify their specific status using allozyme electrophoresis. Zooplankton samples were collected between 2002 and 2004 from each basin of Lake Balaton.

40|$|Cyclomarins are potent {{anti-inflammatory}} cyclic peptides originally {{encountered in}} the estuarine streptomycete, strain CNB- 982, and subsequently isolated from the marine obligate actinobacterium Salinispora arenicola CNS- 205 along with the truncated antibacterial diketopiperazine cyclomarazines. The cyclomarins are composed of seven amino acid residues, {{two of which are}} of unique biosynthetic interest, 2 -amino- 3, 5 -dimethylhex- 4 -enoic acid (ADH), which has never been reported as a constituent of any peptide, and N-(1, 1 -dimethyl- 1 -allyl) - tryptophan, which is a rare example of the prenylation of a bacterial non-ribosomal peptide. The N-prenylated tryptophan residue, along with [delta]-hydroxyleucine, is present in both the cyclomarins and cyclomarazines, suggesting a common biosynthetic origin. Because of the unique structural features of ADH and N-(1, 1 -dimethyl- 1 -allyl) - tryptophan, along with the extensive tailoring of the remaining residues of cyclomarin, we initiated the interrogation of the biosynthetic machinery behind cyclomarin and cyclomarazine synthesis. We were able to determine the basic steps of cyclomarin and cyclomarazine production, along with insights into how the two unique amino acids are synthesized. Furthermore, we were able to identify the oxidative enzymes involved in tailoring both peptides. Analysis of the genome sequence of S. arenicola CNS- 205 revealed the cym biosynthetic gene cluster, which is dominated by cymA, encoding for a seven module non- ribosomal peptide synthetase. Downstream of cymA are the genes for N-(1, 1 -dimethyl- 1 -allyl) - tryptophan synthesis via the prenyltransferase CymD, and ADH via cymE-H. CymEF is an aldolase/dehydrogenase pair utilized for the key C-C bond forming step of ADH synthesis, along with a methyltransferase CymG, and a dehydrogenase CymH. Upstream of cymA is the Fe²⁺/[alpha]-ketoglutarate dependent leucine [delta]-oxygenase CymW, and three cytochrome P 450 <b>s</b> <b>oxidases,</b> CymO, CymS, and CymV. Bioinformatic analysis coupled with in vivo mutagenesis confirmed the role of Cym W along with CymS as a N-(1, 1 -dimethyl- 1 -allyl) - tryptophan [beta]-hydroxylase, and CymV as a N-(1, 1 - dimethyl- 2, 3 -epoxypropyl) -tryptophan epoxidase, and suggested the function of CymO as a phenylalanine [beta]- hydroxylase. In addition to establishing the function of the aforementioned enzymes, we were able to generate the novel N-(1 -methyl) -tryptophan and N-(1 -propargyl) - tryptophan analogs of both sized peptides in the cymD deficient mutant, confirming the preference for N- alkylated tryptophan residues and the amenability of cyclomarin and cyclomarazine to derivatization via mutasynthesi...|$|R

The members of the flavin adenosine dinucleotide (FAD) -dependent acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and acyl-CoA oxidase families catalyze similar reactions and share common structural features. However, both enzyme families feature opposing reaction specificities in respect to dioxygen. Dehydrogenases react with electron transfer flavoproteins as terminal electron acceptors and do not show a considerable reactivity with dioxygen, whereas dioxygen serves as a bona fide substrate for oxidases. We recently engineered (2 S) -methylsuccinyl-CoA dehydrogenase towards oxidase activity by rational mutagenesis. Here we characterized the (2 S) -methylsuccinyl-CoA dehydrogenase wild-type, {{as well as the}} engineered (2 <b>S)</b> -methylsuccinyl-CoA <b>oxidase,</b> in detail.

The PX domains of two oxidase components, p 47 phox and p 40 phox, are known to bind phosphoinositide products of PI 3 Ks but the physiological roles of these interactions are unclear. We have created mice which carry an R 58 A mutation in the PX domain of their p 40 phox gene, which selectively prevents binding to PtdIns 3 P. p 40 phoxR 58 A/R 58 A embryos do not develop normally but p 40 phoxR 58 A/− mice are viable and neutrophils from these animals exhibit significantly reduced oxidase responses compared to those from their p 40 phox+/− siblings (e. g. 60 % reduced in response to phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus). Wortmannin inhibition of the <b>S.</b> aureus <b>oxidase</b> response correlates with inhibition of phagosomal PtdIns 3 P accumulation and overlaps with the reduction in this response caused by the R 58 A mutation, suggesting PI 3 K regulation of this response is substantially dependent on PtdIns 3 P-binding to p 40 phox. p 40 phoxR 58 A/− mice are significantly compromised in their ability to kill S. aureus in vivo, defining the physiological importance of this interaction...|$|R

With S, their 2 '-sulfo-adducts were found instead, the structures of which were confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Also, for minor caffeoyl derivatives and quercetin glycosides, the corresponding sulfo-adducts were observed. Feruloyl and sinapoyl derivatives were not chemically affected by the presence of <b>S.</b> Polyphenol <b>oxidase</b> (PPO) was thought to be responsible for the formation of the sulfo-adducts. This was confirmed by preparing 2 '-sulfo- 5 -O-caffeoyl quinic acid in a model system using 5 -CQA, {{sodium hydrogen sulfite}}, and PPO. This sulfo-adduct exhibited a small bathochromic shift (¿max 329 nm) as compared to 5 -CQA (¿max 325 nm) and a strong hypochromic shift with an extinction coefficient of 9357 ± 395 M– 1 cm– 1 as compared to 18494 ± 196 M– 1 cm– 1, respectively.

Schistosome egg {{production}} {{is dependent upon}} the activities of two developmentally regulated tyrosinases. The FASEB Journal, 21 (7), 823 - 835. Egg production is responsible for life cycle progression and host immunopathology during schistosomiasis, with the associated parasite molecules being investigated as potential novel chemotherapeutic targets. Here, we characterize two Schistosoma mansoni products, tyrosinase 1 and tyrosinase 2 (SmTYR 1 /SmTYR 2) and show that their diphenol oxidase enzyme activities are critical for eggshell formation and production. The genes encoding these bifunctional enzymes (monophenol and diphenol oxidases) result from a duplication event that likely occurred before speciation and exist in the parasite?s genome as multiple copies, which are linked and localized to chromosomes 4 and W. SmTYR 1 /SmTYR 2 transcription and diphenol oxidase action are developmentally regulated with most enzyme activity localized to the eggshell?producing cells contained within the vitellaria of adult female worms. Importantly, kojic-acid mediated inhibition (IC 50 = 0. 5 ?M) of SmTYR 1 /SmTYR 2 ?<b>s</b> diphenol <b>oxidase</b> activity during in vitro culture of sexually mature adult worms resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} the production of phenotypically normal eggs.

Moreover, the thermodynamic equilibrium of O 2 reduction {{is a valuable}} driving force for mostly energetically unfavorable biocatalytic oxidations. Here, we present the generation of an NAD(P) H oxidase with high activity for both cofactors, NADH and NADPH. Starting from the strictly NADH specific water-forming Streptococcus mutans NADH oxidase 2 several rationally designed cofactor binding site mutants were created and kinetic values for NADH and NADPH conversion were determined. Double mutant 93 R 94 H showed comparable high rates and low Km values for NADPH (kcat 20 s− 1, Km 6 μM) and NADH (kcat 25 s− 1, Km 9 μM) with retention of 70 % of wild type activity towards NADH. Moreover, by screening of a SeSaM library <b>S.</b> mutans NADH <b>oxidase</b> 2 variants showing predominantly NADPH activity were found, giving further insight into cofactor binding site architecture. Applicability for cofactor regeneration is shown for coupling with alcohol dehydrogenase from Sphyngobium yanoikuyae for 2 -heptanone production...|$|R
