5|$|Between 2008 and 2010, Lebrón {{was hospitalized}} {{multiple}} times, the first being {{due to a}} <b>fall</b> <b>that</b> fractured her hip and an arm, requiring surgery. On September 18, 2009, she suffered a notable relapse due to a cardio respiratory affection. Lebrón recovered in a satisfactory manner and issued a press release in appreciation for the public's support. Complications from this episode of bronchitis, however, persisted throughout 2010, leading to her death on August 1, 2010. Multiple public figures, who support independence or free association for Puerto Rico, immediately lamented Lebrón's death, praising her activism. Her life was eulogized even in European papers.|$|E
5|$|During the Internet bubble {{that led}} up to 2000, heavy {{investments}} in undersea fibre-optic cables linked Asia {{with the rest of the}} world. The <b>fall</b> <b>that</b> followed the economic boom resulted in the auction of cheap fiber optic cables at one-tenth of their original price. This development resulted in widely available low-cost communications infrastructure. All of these investments and events, not to mention a swell of available talent, resulted in India becoming almost overnight the centre for outsourcing of Business process. Within this sector and events, the ITES-BPO sector has become a big employment generator especially amongst young college graduates. The number of professionals employed by IT and ITES sectors is estimated at around 1.3million as of March 2006. Also, Indian IT-ITES is estimated to have helped create an additional 3 million job opportunities through indirect, induced and in helpful manner have created employment.|$|E

5|$|The {{rules of}} the story stress that time cannot be changed through {{traveller}} actions as per the Novikov self-consistency principle; Paul Serene gives an example of trying to save a dead vagrant he and Jack discovered in their youth, only to startle the vagrant and cause the <b>fall</b> <b>that</b> killed him when he goes back in time. Another enforced rule is that travelers can only move between machines located at different times using the same core: as such, {{it is impossible for}} the characters to travel back before the first power-up of the core, nor would they be able to travel between different time machines as the cores would be different. The game features narration from Jack himself.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the first act, the judge asks the court clerk to call jurors from the audience. Once the jurors are seated, the prosecution argument begins. Flint explains that Andre was not just Faulkner's secretary, but also his lover. He says Faulkner jilted her to marry Nancy Lee Whitfield and fired Andre, motivating Andre to murder him. Flint then calls a series of witnesses, starting with the medical examiner, who testifies that Faulkner's body was so damaged by the <b>fall</b> <b>that</b> it was impossible to determine whether he was killed by the impact or was already dead. An elderly night watchman and a private investigator describe the events they saw that evening. A police inspector testifies to finding a suicide note. Faulkner's very religious housekeeper disapprovingly describes the sexual relationship between Andre and Faulkner, and says she saw Andre with another man after Faulkner's marriage. Nancy Lee testifies about her and Faulkner's courtship and marriage, portraying both as idyllic. The act ends with Andre speaking out of turn to accuse Nancy Lee of lying.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, at Ciudad de Mexico, Plumb took an {{individual}} 14th, while the US team again {{finished with a}} silver. In 1970, when Jack le Goff became coach of the United States eventing team, Plumb {{was one of only}} three active US riders with international experience in the sport. Between then and 1984, when le Goff retired, the US eventing team, with Plumb as part, amassed three team and three individual medals, as well as additional triumphs at the World Equestrian Games and Pan-American Games. At the 1972 Summer Olympics, the US team took the silver medal for the third Games in a row, while Plumb finished 20th individually. At the 1976 Games, Plumb achieved his only individual medal, taking silver, while the US team took gold. Despite the US boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics, Plumb competed at the alternate games in Fontainebleau, France. The team repeated this performance at the 1984 Olympics, while Plumb took {{an individual}} 10th place. In 1988, he was slated to make the US Equestrian Team, but was not able to compete due to a <b>fall</b> <b>that</b> resulted in a broken collarbone.

5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Virginia Tech in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a second-and-nine at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the quarter, Druckenmiller completed a 20-yard pass to Oxendine for a first down at the Tech 40-yard line. Parker ran for three yards, but Tech was forced to call a timeout before the next play. During the timeout, a light rain began to <b>fall</b> <b>that</b> would last through {{the remainder of the}} game. Coming out of the timeout, Druckenmiller threw an incomplete pass, but made it up on the next play by rushing for 16 yards, picking up a first down at the 41-yard line of Nebraska. This was followed by another rush by Druckenmiller, this time for nine yards. The two gains were negated on the next play, however, as Virginia Tech committed a penalty that pushed the Hokies back to their 41-yard line. Druckenmiller then threw two incomplete passes, and Tech was forced to punt.|$|E

Li became {{the first player to}} defeat her this season and {{advanced}} to the semifinals where she ousted world No. 2 Maria Sharapova in straight sets, who had only dropped a record-low nine games in the tournament. This marked Li's second Australian Open final appearance in three years, finishing runner-up to Kim Clijsters in 2011. In the final, Li was hampered by injuries, falling over on two occasions. The first of which occurred at 1–3 in the second set, a <b>fall</b> <b>that</b> saw Li incur a 10-minute medical timeout. She fell over a second time after the Australia Day fireworks break, not only twisting her left ankle once more but also heavily knocking the rear of her head on the court, causing a momentary black-out. Despite being severely hindered in her movement, she continued playing but eventually lost the match in three sets to Victoria Azarenka.|$|E

25|$|The year {{previous}} to that Knutton {{had been}} playing in the Bradford League when he was selected to play a hastily arranged first-class fixture for an England XI (which contained one former Test player in Willie Quaife) against the touring Australians at Park Avenue, Bradford. The fixture had only come about after the Coronation of King Edward VII had been postponed after the King had developed appendicitis, allowing a fixture to be played on the day in which the King would have been crowned. Winning the toss and electing to bat first, the Australians made 402 all out in their first-innings. Knutton, who was the only fast bowler in the side, finished with figures of 9/100, including taking the first eight Australian wickets to fall: Trumper, Noble, Hill, Darling, Hopkins, Duff, Armstrong, and Carter, before taking the final wicket to <b>fall,</b> <b>that</b> of Saunders. Despite this, the Australians were still able to amass a large total, mostly down to Duff's 182. Responding in their first-innings, the England XI made 240 all out, with Knutton being dismissed by Noble for 8 runs. Forced to follow-on, the England XI were dismissed for 203, with Knutton contributing being dismissed for 5 runs by the same bowler. Requiring 41 for victory, the Australians reached their target with three wickets down, one of which (Darling's) fell to Knutton. He finished with match figures of 10/117. He never appeared in first-class cricket again, but did continue {{to play in the}} Bradford League, where he took thousands of wickets. However, his high-arm brisk bowling action was sometimes regarded as suspect.|$|E
25|$|When Susan Richards {{experienced}} {{problems with}} her second pregnancy while Reed was away, Johnny contacted Doom for help, correctly guessing that Doom {{will be unable}} to pass up a chance to succeed where Reed failed (due to the complex events involving the then-recent resurrection of Galactus, this pregnancy is a 'repeat' of an earlier one where Sue miscarried). Doom not only saves Sue's daughter but also cured Johnny of a recent problem with his powers where Johnny was unable to 'flame off' without technological support after becoming overcharged with energy from the Negative Zone by channeling Johnny's excess energy into Sue to keep her alive. After the birth, Doom's only apparent condition for his aid is that he be allowed to name Sue and Reed's daughter, calling her 'Valeria' after his long-lost love. However, this inspires a new plan where Doom makes Valeria his familiar while seeking out her namesake as part of a deal with a trio of demons; by sacrificing his old lover, Doom is granted magical powers on the level he would possess if he had spent the past years studying sorcery rather than science. With this new power, Doom trapped Franklin in Hell, immobilised Doctor Strange, and then neutralises the FF's powers, torturing the other three while taunting Reed by leaving him in his magical library, comparing it to giving a dog a road-map as he concluded that it would be impossible for Reed to master sufficient magical skill to be a threat to him. However, Reed was able to release Doctor Strange's astral self from Doom's traps, allowing Strange to give Reed a sufficient crash-course in magic for Reed to free {{the rest of the team}} and trick Doom into angering his demonic benefactors, prompting them to take him to Hell. Determined to ensure that Doom cannot be a further threat, Reed takes control of Latveria to dismantle all of Doom's equipment, simultaneously subtly driving his family away so that he can trap Doom and himself in a pocket dimension so that he can make sure Doom never threatens anyone again. However, this plan backfires when the rest of the team attempt to rescue Reed, resulting in Doom transferring his spirit into Sue, Johnny and Ben respectively, forcing Reed to kill his best friend to stop his greatest enemy. Doom was returned to Hell, but Reed is later able to use the same machine Doom once tried to create to travel to Heaven and restore Ben to life. Doom remained in Hell until Mjolnir falls to Earth after the events of Ragnarok as it creates a dimensional tear during its <b>fall</b> <b>that</b> allows Doom to escape, although he decides to focus on rebuilding his power base when he proves unable to even lift the hammer. The events of this were deleted from Marvel Comics continuity in the 2015 series Secret Wars.|$|E
