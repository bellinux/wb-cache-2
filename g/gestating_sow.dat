40|$|At present, {{substantial}} {{amounts of}} low-cost, fibrous co-products are incorporated into pig diets {{to reduce the cost}} of raising swine. However, diets that are rich in fiber are of low nutritive value because pigs cannot degrade dietary fiber. In addition, high-fiber diets have been associated with reduced nutrient utilization and pig performance. However, recent reports are often contradictory and the negative effects of high-fiber diets are influenced by the fiber source, type, and inclusion level. In addition, the effects of dietary fiber on pig growth and physiological responses are often confounded by the many analytical methods that are used to measure dietary fiber and its components. Several strategies have been employed to ameliorate the negative effects associated with the ingestion of high-fiber diets in pigs and to improve the nutritive value of such diets. Exogenous fiber-degrading enzymes are widely used to improve nutrient utilization and pig performance. However, the results of research reports have not been consistent and {{there is a need to}} elucidate the mode of action of exogenous enzymes on the metabolic and physiological responses in pigs that are fed high-fiber diets. On the other hand, dietary fiber is increasingly used as a means of promoting pig gut health and <b>gestating</b> <b>sow</b> welfare. In this review, dietary fiber and its effects on pig nutrition, gut physiology, and sow welfare are discussed. In addition, areas that need further research are suggested to gain more insight into dietary fiber and into the use of exogenous enzymes to improve the utilization of high-fiber diets by pigs...|$|E
40|$|In the European Union, the group-housed {{pregnant}} sows {{have to have}} {{a minimal}} legal available area of 2. 25 m²/sow. However, it has been observed that an increased space allowance reduces agonistic behaviour and consecutive wounds and thus induces better welfare conditions. But, what about the environmental impacts of this greater available area? Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} quantify pollutant gases emissions (nitrous oxide, N 2 O, methane, CH 4, carbon dioxide, CO 2 and ammonia, NH 3), according to the space allowance in the raising of gestating sows group-housed on a straw-based deep litter. Four successive batches of 10 gestating sows were each divided into two homogeneous groups and randomly allocated to a treatment: 2. 5 v. 3. 0 m²/sow. The groups were separately kept in two identical rooms. A restricted conventional cereals based diet was provided once a day in individual feeding stalls available only during the feeding time. Rooms were automatically ventilated. The gas emissions were measured by infra red photoacoustic detection during six consecutive days at the 6 th, 9 th and 12 th weeks of gestation. Sows performance (body weight gain, backfat thickness, number and weight of piglets) was not significantly different according to the space allowance. In the room with 3. 0 m²/sow and compared with the room with 2. 5 m²/sow, gaseous emissions were significantly greater for NH 3 (6. 29 v. 5. 37 g NH 3 -N/day per sow; P< 0. 01) and significantly lower for N 2 O (1. 78 v. 2. 48 g N 2 O-N/day per sow; P< 0. 01), CH 4 (10. 15 v. 15. 21 g/day per sow; P< 0. 001), CO 2 equivalents (1. 11 v. 1. 55 kg/day per sow; P< 0. 001), CO 2 (2. 12 v. 2. 41 kg/day per sow; P, 0 < 001) and H 2 O (3. 10 v. 3. 68 kg/day per sow; P< 0. 001). In conclusion, an increase of the available area for group-housed <b>gestating</b> <b>sow</b> kept on straw-based deep litter seems to be ambiguous on an environmental impacts point of view. Compared with a conventional and legal available area, it favoured NH 3 emissions, probably due to an increased emitting surface. However, about greenhouse gases, it decreased N 2 O, CH 4 and CO 2 emissions, probably due to reduced anaerobic conditions required for their synthesis, and led to a reduction of CO 2 equivalents emissions.

40|$|Animal {{welfare is}} a {{controversial}} topic in modern animal agriculture, {{partly because it}} generates interest from both the scientific community and the general public. The housing of gestating sows, particularly individual housing, {{is one of the}} most critical concerns in farm animal welfare. We hypothesize that the physical size of the standard gestation stall may limit movement and evoke demands and challenges on the sow to affect the physiological and psychological well-being of the individually housed sow. Thus, improvements in the design of the individual gestation stall system that allow more freedom to move, such as increasing stall width or designing a stall that could accommodate the changing size of the pregnant sow, may improve sow welfare. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the effects of a width adjustable stall (FLEX) on productivity and behavior of dry sows. The experiment consisted of 3 replications (block 1, n= 4 sows; block 2, n= 4 sows; block 3, n= 8 sows), and multi-parious sows were allotted to either a FLEX stall or standard gestation stall for 1 gestation period. Sow mid-girth (top of the back to bottom of the udder) was measured 5 - 6 times throughout gestation to determine the best time points for FLEX stall width expansions. FLEX stall width was adjusted according to mid-girth measurements, and expanded to achieve an additional 2 cm of space between the bottom of the sow’s udder and floor of the stall so that sows could lie in full lateral recumbency without touching the sides of the stall. Productivity data recorded included: sow body weight (BW) and BW gain, number of piglets born and born alive, proportions of piglets stillborn, mummified, lost between birth and weaning, and weaned, and litter and mean piglet birth BW, weaning BW, and average BW gain from birth-to-weaning. Lesions were recorded on d 21 and d 111 of gestation. Sub-pilot behavior data were observed and registered for replicate 1 sows using continuous video-records for the l 2 hour lights on period (period 1, 0600 - 1000; period 2, 1000 - 1400; period 3, 1400 - 1800) prior FLEX stall adjustment and 12 hour lights on period post adjustment on d 21, 22, 23, 43, 44, 45, 93, 94, 95. A randomized complete block design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement for treatments was used to analyze sow productivity and performance traits. Data were analyzed using the Mixed Models procedure of SAS. A preliminary analysis of data means and numerical trends was used to analyze sow behavior measurements. Sows housed in a FLEX stall had more (P < 0. 05) total born and a tendency for more piglets born alive (P = 0. 06) than sows housed in a standard stall. Sow body weight also tended to be higher (P = 0. 06) for sows housed in a FLEX stall compared to sows housed in a standard stall. There were numerical trends for mean durations of sit, lay, lay (OUT), and eat behaviors to be greater for sows housed in a FLEX stall compared with sows housed in a standard stall. The mean duration of lay (IN) behavior tended to be numerically less for sows housed in a FLEX stall compared with sows housed in a standard stall. There were numerical trends for the mean durations of stand and drink behaviors to be greater for sows housed in a standard stall compared with sows housed in a FLEX stall. The mean frequencies of postural changes and mean durations of oral-nasal-facial and sham-chew behaviors were numerically similar between types of gestation stall. Mean durations and numerical trends indicate that time of day influenced all of the behaviors assessed in this study. The results of this pilot study indicate that the adjustable FLEX stall may affect sow productivity and behavior differently than the standard gestation stall, and thus potentially improve sow well-being. Future research should continue to compare the new FLEX stall design to current housing systems in use and examine physiological traits and immune status in addition to behavioral and productivity traits to assess the effects that this housing system has on the overall welfare of the <b>gestating</b> <b>sow...</b>|$|E

40|$|Usually, <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> are restrictedly-fed {{to prevent}} {{excessive}} body weight gain and fat deposition. However, feed restriction causes sustained feeding motivation resulting in stereotypic behaviour and impairment of animal welfare. High fibre diets (HFD) {{are known to}} reduce feeding motivation without impairments of performance but the effects of HFD on emissions of pollutant gases are very few studied. Thus, a study was carried out to compare the effect of two fibre contents (standard diet (STD) with 22 % of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) vs. HFD with 44 % of NSP) on emissions of ammonia (E-NH 3), nitrous oxide (E-N 2 O), methane (E-CH 4) and CO 2 -equivalents (E-EqCO 2) associated to <b>gestating</b> <b>sows.</b> Three successive batches of 10 <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> were divided into 2 homogeneous groups and randomly allocated {{to one of two}} treatments: STD vs. HFD. The groups were kept separately in two identical rooms equipped with a pen divided into a lying area with slatted floor and five individual feeding stalls with permanent access. Emissions were measured by infrared photoacoustic detection. The HFD significantly decreased ENH 3 (12. 1 vs. 15. 9 g/sow. day) but increased E-EqCO 2 (0. 68 vs. 0. 47 kg/sow. day) in relation with an increase of E-CH 4 (18. 4 vs. 9. 1 g/sow. day), E-N 2 O being not impacted by the diet, with value around 0. 60 g/sow. day. So, the effects of HFD offered to <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> on slatted floor on environment seem conflicting with a decrease of NH 3 emissions which mainly contribute to acidification of soils and waters and eutrophication, but an increase of CO 2 -quivalents emissions which contribute to greenhouse effect and climate change...|$|R

To answer this question, a study was scheduled to quantify pollutant gas emissions (nitrous oxide -N 2 O-, methane -CH 4 -, carbon dioxide -CO 2 - and ammonia -NH 3 -) according to floor type in the raising of group-housed <b>gestating</b> <b>sows.</b> The trial was carried out in experimental rooms located at Liège University (Belgium). Three successive batches of 10 <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> were used for this trial. Each batch was divided into 2 homogeneous groups randomly allocated to one of two treatments: concrete slatted floor or straw-based deep litter. The groups were kept separately in two identical rooms equipped with a pen divided into a lying area (slatted floor or deep litter) and five individual feeding stalls. The feeding stalls were equipped with front feeding troughs and rear gates preventing access to the stalls outside of the feeding time. Between each batch of sows, the pens were cleaned. In both rooms, ventilation was automatically adapted to maintain a constant ambient temperature. The gas emissions were measured 3 times (weeks 2, 5 and 8 of stay) during 6 consecutive days by infra red photoacoustic detection. Sow performance (body weight gain, backfat thickness, number and weight of piglets) was not significantly affected by floor type. With sows kept on slatted floor, gaseous emissions were significantly greater for NH 3 (12. 77 vs. 9. 05 g d- 1 sow- 1; P 0. 05). In conclusion, the main environmental disadvantage of the deep litter system pointed to in this study was the greater N 2 O-emissions and thus greater CO 2 eq-emissions compared to slatted floor.

Gestation housing system treatments were as follows: 1) individual gestation stalls in a mechanically ventilated confinement {{building with a}} partially slatted floor and a manure flush system and 2) group pens with individual feed stalls in deep-bedded, naturally ventilated hoop barns. In all, 957 litters from 353 sows were evaluated. Number of pigs born alive per litter differed for the 2 housing treatments (P = 0. 002). <b>Sows</b> <b>gestated</b> in hoop barns gave birth to more live pigs per litter (10. 0 ± 0. 2 pigs) than <b>sows</b> <b>gestated</b> in stalls (9. 3 ± 0. 2 pigs).

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} long-term effects of feeding sows high levels of dietary fermentable non-starch polysaccharides CNSP) (i. e., NSP from sugar beet pulp) restrictedly or ad libitum during gestation or ad libitum during lactation on behavior, reproductive performance, and development in body weight and backfat thickness. During gestation, sows were group-housed. Feeding <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> a high level of dietary fermentable NSP restrictedly reduced the frequency of total non-feeding oral activities in gestation compared with a starch diet. Feeding sows a high level of dietary fermentable NSP during lactation reduced the frequency of total non-feeding oral activities during subsequent gestation compared with a starch diet. Body weight and backfat gains during gestation were lower in sows fed a high level of dietary fermentable NSP restrictedly during gestation over three successive parities than in sows fed a starch diet restrictedly. These results indicate an overestimation of the energy value of fermentable NSP. Body weight and backfat losses during lactation were less in sows fed a high level of dietary fermentable NSP during gestation than in sows fed a starch diet. Sows fed a high level of dietary fermentable NSP during lactation lost more backfat during lactation than sows fed a starch diet. The number of live born piglets was 0. 5 piglet higher in sows fed a high level of dietary fermentable NSP from weaning until mating and during subsequent gestation than in sows fed a starch diet. It may be that this effect can be attributed to feeding sows a high level of dietary fermentable NSP from weaning until mating. Lactation diet did not affect the number of live born piglets in the following parity. <b>Gestating</b> <b>sows</b> that were fed a high level of dietary fermentable NSP ad libitum during three successive parities ate 1. 3 kg/d more during gestation than sows that were fed a starch diet restrictedly (4. 2 versus 2. 9 kg/d), resulting in higher body weight and backfat gains during gestation and greater losses in body weight and backfat during lactation. Feed intake during lactation was similar in sows that were fed restrictedly or ad libitum during gestation. Reproductive performance was not affected by feeding <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> a high level of dietary fermentable NSP ad libitum. Ad libitum fed sows spent 90 min/d eating whereas restrictedly fed sows spent 24 min/d eating. An increase in time spent eating is associated with a reduction in feeding motivation and in stereotypic behaviors. In conclusion, feeding <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> a high level of dietary fermentable NSP reduces the level of stereotypic behavior in gestation compared to a starch diet. Feeding sows a diet {{with a high level of}} fermentable NSP during lactation has an additional reducing effect on the development of stereotypic behavior in subsequent gestation.

40|$|Phosphorus in most diets for {{breeding}} sows is digested for 20 to 40 %, thus {{leading to a}} relatively high amount of P in the manure. To enhance the P digestibility in diets for both lactating and <b>gestating</b> <b>sows,</b> two separate experiments were carried out to study the efficacy of OptiphosTM phytase derived from E. coli and produced by the yeast Pichia pastoris. Thirty crossbred <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> and 36 lactating sows were used in these studies. Five treatments were imposed on the gestating sows: 1) a negative control treatment, based on a low-P diet without added feed phosphate and microbial phytase. Diets in Treatments 2, 3 and 4 {{were the same as}} the negative control diet, except that an amount of Optiphos phytase of 125, 250 and 1, 000 U. kg- 1 of diet, respectively, was added. Treatment 5 was the positive control diet, based on the same diet with 1. 0 g of added digestible P. kg- 1 of diet from monocalcium phosphate. The lactating sows of Treatments 1 to 6 received a negative control diet, the same diet with an amount of OptiphosTM phytase of 125, 250, 500 and 1000 U. kg- 1 of diet and a positive control diet supplemented with 1. 5 g of digestible P. kg- 1, respectively. The negative control diets were different in ingredient composition because of the different nutrient requirements between lactating and <b>gestating</b> <b>sows.</b> The ratio between Ca and digestible P was kept at 2. 8 : 1 and 3. 3 : 1 for the lactating and gestating diets, respectively, with a minimum of 5. 0 g Ca. kg- 1. Feeding level of the sows was according to Dutch recommendations. Six sows per treatment were used. The lactating sows received the diets from 2 weeks before farrowing until weaning of the piglets at 4 weeks of age and the <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> from day 49 to day 100 of pregnancy. Faecal samples of the sows were collected by rectal stimulation on days 14 and 21 post-farrowing, and on days 70 and 100 of pregnancy. Digestibility coefficients of dry matter, organic matter, ash and the minerals under investigation were calculated using Cr 2 O 3 as an indigestible marker. In addition, several performance characteristics were registered. Phosphorus digestibility was clearly enhanced by the addition of microbial phytase to the lactating sow diets, as was the digestibility of ash, Ca, Na, K, Cu, and Zn. In the <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> only digestibility of P was significantly enhanced by microbial phytase. In both <b>gestating</b> and lactating <b>sows</b> the lowest level of phytase addition (125 U. kg- 1 of diet) already resulted in the highest response in P digestibility without further improvement at higher phytase inclusion levels. The additional amount of digestible P absorbed with a phytase supplement of 125 or more U. kg- 1 in lactating sows was on average 0. 90 g/kg. An average amount of 0. 36 and 0. 67 g digestible P. kg- 1 was generated in <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> at day 70 and day 100 of pregnancy by this phytase inclusion, respectively. No signs of any adverse effect of phytase on sow or piglet health and performance were observed. OptiphosTM phytase was already highly effective at a dose of 125 U. kg- 1 of diet. Possible reasons for the lack of further improvement of P digestibility at higher doses of phytase are discussed.

Performance of the ad libitum-fed sows was compared to the performance of sows that were fed a conventional diet restrictedly. Feed intake characteristics during gestation were only measured in the ad libitum-fed sows. One hundred and nineteen sows were assigned to one of two gestation feeding regimens. <b>Gestating</b> <b>sows</b> were fed a conventional Dutch diet restrictedly or a diet with a high level of fermentable NSP ad libitum. During lactation, sows were given free access to a commercial lactation diet from d 6 after parturition onward. The ad libitum-fed sows ate 1. 3 kg/d more during gestation than the restrictedly fed sows (P < 0. 001), resulting in higher body weight and backfat gains during gestation (P < 0. 05). Sows that were fed ad libitum during gestation lost more body weight and backfat during lactation (P < 0. 001) than sows that were fed restrictedly during gestation. Feed intake during lactation, however, did not differ between sows that were fed restrictedly or ad libitum during gestation. The numbers of total piglets born, live-born and stillborn piglets, piglet birth weight, weaning-to-estrus interval, and percentage of sows that returned to estrus after first insemination were not affected by gestation feeding regimen. Mean daily voluntary feed intake (as-fed basis) over the three reproduction cycles in the ad libitum-fed <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> was 4. 2 kg/d. Depending on the number of preceding reproduction cycles during which a sow was fed ad libitum, the maximum voluntary feed intake was reached in Parity 3, 4, or 5 and then remained stable in subsequent parities. Mean daily feed intake of the ad libitum-fed sows increased from wk 2 to 6 of gestation and then decreased to wk 15 of gestation. The mean number of daily visits with feed intake over the three reproduction cycles was 13. 8. On average, ad libitum-fed sows spent 90 min/d on eating.

40|$|<b>Gestating</b> <b>sows</b> {{are usually}} fed {{low levels of}} feed, which may not provide {{sufficient}} satiety, and does not allow sows to fully fulfil their motivation to express foraging and feeding behaviours. Feed restriction may therefore lead to high occurrences of non-feeding oral activities, including stereotypies, and restlessness and aggressive behaviour in grouphoused sows, which are interpreted as signals of sustained feeding motivation and frustration. Inclusion of fibres in the diet reduces the energy density of diets and therefore allows for larger meal sizes without increasing the energy supplied. Moreover, dietary fibres influence the mechanisms that enhance satiation and satiety at the sensory, postingestive and post-absorptive levels. This chapter reviews the impact of dietary fibres on behaviour and welfare of <b>gestating</b> <b>sows,</b> and describes their potential consequences for performance. Dietary fibres generally reduce the occurrence of stereotypies and decrease restlessness and activity, with some studies also reporting reduced aggression. These effects are most likely related to behavioural and physiological mechanisms underlying the impact of dietary fibres on satiety and feeding motivation. The extent of the response to dietary fibres is, however, variable and depends {{on the characteristics of}} the fibrous diet (inclusion rate, fibre source, physicochemical properties), housing and feeding conditions, and characteristics of the sows, especially parity, with greater effects in younger sows. Dietary fibres provided during gestation usually result in increased feed intake of sows during lactation, probably due to their effects on the size and capacity of the gastrointestinal tract. Studies on the effects of fibres on reproductive performance are scarce and show variable results, which might partly be attributed to over- or underestimation of the energy content of the diet during pregnancy. In conclusion, dietary fibres generally have a beneficial effect on the behaviour and welfare of <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> which are restrictedfed. The impact of high fibre diets during gestation on reproductive performance over multiple successive cycles in group-housed sows merits further research...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to validate the use of flank-to-flank measurement in predicting weight of lactating sows and to determine the accuracy of the developed models in estimating lactation weight change. A total of 70 lactating sows (PIC Line 1050) were used in this study. Flank-to-flank measurement and body weight were measured on each individual sow after farrowing and at weaning. Flank-to-flank measurement and weight of lactating sows was positively correlated (R 2 = 0. 61; P<. 0001) with the following equation: BW 0. 33, kg = 0. 0371 x Flank-to-flank (cm) + 2. 161. Weights of sows post-farrowing and at weaning were lower (P< 0. 03) when predicted with the previous allometric model developed from growing pigs and sows than their actual weights or weights predicted using the lactating sow model. Likewise, absolute residuals for post-farrowing and weaning weights using a previous allometric model developed from growing pigs and <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> were greater (P< 0. 02) than those of the lactating sow model. There were no differences (P< 0. 89) between the predicted weights using the lactating sow model and their actual weights. There also were no differences between the actual average weight loss (P< 0. 14) and the predicted loss using the lactating sow model. Using the model previously developed with growing pigs and <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> resulted in 15. 5 lb (P< 0. 007) greater than the actual average weight loss. In conclusion, flank-to-flank measurement {{can be used as a}} predictor of weight of lactating sows, with the relationship having less accuracy than those used for growing-finishing pigs, <b>gestating</b> <b>sows,</b> and boars. The pig allometric equation cannot be used to estimate weights of lactating sows and lactation weight change.

40|$|Phosphorus in most diets for {{breeding}} sows is digested from 20 % to 40 %, thus {{leading to a}} relatively high amount of P in the manure. To enhance the P digestibility in diets for both lactating and <b>gestating</b> <b>sows,</b> two separate experiments were carried out to study the efficacy of phytase derived from Peniophora lycii. Thirty crossbred lactating <b>sows</b> and 24 <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> {{were used in the}} studies. Five treatments were imposed on the lactating sows: (1) the negative control, a low-P diet without added feed phosphate and microbial phytase. Treatments 2, 3 and 4 were the same as the negative control diet, except that an amount of 750, 1000 and 10, 000 U of phytase kg¿ 1 of diet, respectively, was added. Treatment 5 was the positive control diet, being treatment 1 with 1. 5 g of digestible P added kg¿ 1 of diet from monocalcium phosphate. The <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> received the same first three treatments and a positive control diet supplemented with 1. 0 g of digestible P kg¿ 1. The negative control diets were different in feedstuff composition. The ratio between Ca and digestible P was kept constant at 2. 9 : 1 and 3. 3 : 1 for the lactating and gestating diets, respectively. Feeding level of the sows was according to Dutch recommendations. Six sows per treatment were used. The lactating sows received the diets from 2 weeks before farrowing until weaning of piglets at 4 weeks of lactation and the <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> from day 49 to day 100 of pregnancy. Sampling of the faeces of the sows was done by rectal stimulation, and carried out at days 15 and 21 post-farrowing, and at days 70 and 99 of pregnancy. Digestibility coefficients of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), ash and the minerals under investigation were calculated using Cr 2 O 3 as an indigestible marker. In addition, several performance characteristics were observed. Phosphorus digestibility was clearly enhanced by the addition of microbial phytase to the sow diets, as was the digestibility of ash, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cu and Zn. There was a positive relationship between dose of phytase and the amount of liberated digestible phosphorus in lactating sows. The difference in liberated amount of digestible P between 1000 and 10, 000 U kg¿ 1 was 0. 34 g/kg of lactating diet. An amount of 0. 77 and 0. 42 g digestible P kg¿ 1 was liberated by 750 U/kg in the lactation and gestating diets, respectively. No signs of any adverse effect of phytase was observed on sow or piglet health and performance, even at a dose of 10, 000 U kg¿ 1. The performance of piglets and sows at 10, 000 U phytase kg¿ 1 was comparable to or better than the positive control diet. If feed phosphates are (partly) replaced by 750 U phytase kg¿ 1 of diet, then P excretion can be reduced by 0. 75 ¿ 0. 90 kg per breeding sow per year...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{gestation}} housing {{systems on}} sow and litter performance were evaluated for 2. 5 yr at the ISU Lauren Christian Swine Research Farm, Atlantic, Iowa. Gestation housing system treatments were 1) individual gestation stalls in a mechanically ventilated confinement {{building with a}} partially slatted floor and a manure flush system; and 2) group pens with individual feed stalls in deep-bedded, naturally ventilated hoop barns. The confinement facility was more than 15 yr old and had been updated in the late 1990 s. The two gestation hoop barns were built {{at the same time}} as the confinement facility was remodeled. This is a final project summary. In all, 957 litters from 353 sows were analyzed using mixed models. The number of pigs born alive per litter differed for the two housing treatments (P = 0. 002), with gestation in hoop barns resulting in more pigs born alive per litter. Prewean mortality was not different for the two housing treatments (P = 0. 70). Cross-fostering was done to equalize litter size within 24 h of birth, which resulted in an equal number of weaned pigs per sow (P = 0. 50) regardless of gestation housing treatment. Wean-to-breed interval was different (P = 0. 01) with sows kept in stalls returning to estrus sooner (4. 3 ± 0. 6 d) than <b>sows</b> <b>gestated</b> in hoop barns (6. 0 ± 0. 6 d).

Gestation housing system treatments were 1) individual gestation crates in a mechanically ventilated, partially slatted floor manure flush confinement building (C); and 2) group pens with individual feed stalls in deep-bedded, naturally ventilated hoop barns (H). Sows were artificially inseminated in a mechanically ventilated, partially slatted floor confinement breeding barn. Sows were moved {{as a group}} to their assigned gestation housing treatment by the ninth day post-weaning. Sows {{were randomly assigned to}} gestation housing treatment when the project commenced. All first parity gilts were gestated in individual crates and randomly assigned to a gestation group after breeding for the second parity. Farrowing occurred throughout the year on a bi-weekly schedule. All sows received 2. 04 kg per day of a cornsoybean meal diet. During the last trimester of gestation, feed allowance was increased to 2. 72 kg. During the winter H sows were fed 25 % more feed and C sows were fed 5 % more feed. Reproductive performance was summarized for 957 litters and analyzed using general linear models. Number born alive per litter was different for the two housing treatments (P 0. 1). H sows also weaned 0. 4 pigs more per litter (P 0. 1). Failure to conceive was the leading reason for culling in both treatments.

The hoop based systems also requires approximately 40 % less non-solar energy to operate as the conventional system although hoop barn-based systems may require more feed. The total non-solar energy input associated with one 136 kg pig produced in a conventional farrow-to-finish system in Iowa and fed a typical corn-soybean meal diet that includes synthetic lysine and exogenous phytase is 967. 9 MJ.

40|$|Introduction: Although the {{conventional}} housing on slatted floor remains predominant in European pig farms, {{a variety of}} alternative housing systems exists for <b>gestating</b> <b>sows.</b> The consequences of these different environments on health of the mothers and on the immunity they transfer to their progeny remain poorly known. This study aimed at determining the influence of two contrasted housing systems during gestation on welfare and health traits of <b>gestating</b> <b>sows,</b> {{as well as on}} the cellular and humoral immunity transferred to the neonate through mammary secretions. Materials and Methods: <b>Gestating</b> <b>sows</b> were raised in groups of 24 individuals in a conventional system on slat (C, n= 18) or in larger pens enriched with straw bedding (E, n= 19). Approximately 10 days before farrowing (gestation day (DG) 105), sows from both systems were transferred to farrowing units with similar conventional crates. Lameness of sows was assessed during the transfer. Saliva was collected for cortisol assay on the morning of DG 35 and 105. Blood was collected on DG 105 for leukocyte count, haptoglobin, oxidative stress, immunoglobulin (Ig) G and A measurements. Mammary secretions were collected at farrowing (1 - 2 h after the birth of the first piglet) and 4 days later (L 4, milk collection after 1 ml oxytocin administration) for cell numeration, and IgG and IgA content analysis. On L 4, two piglets per litter were blood sampled for IgG measurement. Results: Salivary cortisol concentration was lower in E than C sows at both DG 35 and 105 (P 0. 10) between the two groups of sows. At the transfer to farrowing stalls, lameness was significantly more prevalent in C than E sows (18 vs 2 %, P < 0. 001). The absolute numbers of total cells, and among them of immune CD 45 + cells, per ml of mammary secretion were similar in E and C sows in colostrum but greater in E than C sows at L 4 (+ 125 %, P < 0. 05). Concentrations of IgG in colostrum, IgA in milk at L 4, and IgG in piglet blood at L 4 were similar in C and E animals. [br/] Conclusion: To conclude, cortisol, lameness frequency, granulocyte counts and oxidative stress markers indicated that health and welfare of sows were greater in the E system. These differences during gestation did not affect the transfer of cellular and humoral immunity to the piglets via colostrum, but might have affected the transfer of cellular immune components in the milk afterwards.

Carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) are greenhouse gases taking part in the global problem of climate change. Ammonia (NH 3) emissions are responsible of soil and water acidification and eutrophication and contribute also to indirect emissions of N 2 O. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of a high-fibre diet offered ad libitum to <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> on gaseous emissions (NH 3, N 2 O, CH 4, CO 2 and water vapour (H 2 O)). Four successive batches of 10 <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> were used for this trial. Each batch was divided into 2 homogeneous groups randomly allocated to a treatment: restricted conventional cereals based diet or high-fibre diet based on sugar beet pulp (42 %). The groups were separately kept in two identical rooms equipped with a straw-bedded pen of 12. 6 m². For restricted sows, meals were provided once a day in individual feeding stalls available only during the feeding time. In both rooms, ventilation was automatically adapted to maintain a constant ambient temperature. The gas emissions were measured by infrared photoacoustic detection during 6 consecutive days at the 6 th, 9 th and 12 th weeks of gestation. Sows performance (body weight gain, backfat thickness, number and weight of piglets) was not significantly different according to the diet. With sows offered high-fibre diet and compared to sows offered restricted diet, gaseous emissions were significantly greater for NH 3 (9. 64 g NH 3 -N d- 1 sow- 1 vs. 5. 37 g NH 3 -N d- 1 sow- 1; P < 0. 001), CH 4 (17. 20 g d- 1 sow- 1 vs. 15. 21 g d- 1 sow- 1; P < 0. 01), CO 2 (3. 00 kg d- 1 sow- 1 vs. 2. 41 kg d- 1 sow- 1; P < 0. 001) and H 2 O (4. 71 kg d- 1 sow- 1 vs. 3. 68 kg d- 1 sow- 1; P < 0. 001) and significantly lower for N 2 O (0. 97 g N 2 O-N d- 1 sow- 1 vs. 2. 48 g N 2 O-N d- 1 sow- 1; P < 0. 001) and CO 2 equivalents (0. 88 kg d- 1 sow- 1 vs. 1. 55 kg d- 1 sow- 1; P < 0. 001).

The experiment was conducted on a commercial sow farm in northeast Kansas that typically housed <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> and gilts in pens. Treatments consisted of feeding similar amounts of feed to each sow or gilt over 2 (07 : 00 and 15 : 30) or 6 meals per day (07 : 00, 07 : 30, 08 : 00, 15 : 30, 16 : 00, and 16 : 30 hours). There were 8 sows or 12 gilts in each pen. Gilts and sows were moved to pens after breeding. In <b>gestating</b> <b>sows,</b> there were no differences (P> 0. 10) between treatments in ADG, backfat change, or variation in body weight. There was a trend (P 0. 10) among treatments. Sows fed 6 times a day had increased vocalization during the morning (P 0. 10) for gilts fed 2 or 6 times per day. Gilts fed twice a day had less weight variation at both d 42 (P 0. 10) for reproductive performance, skin and vulva lesions, and leg/feet and hoof scores. In conclusion, there were few growth, farrowing, or aggression differences among gilts fed either 2 or 6 times per day. This suggests that either feeding method is suitable for group-housed gilts. Among sows, different feeding frequency resulted in few growth or farrowing-performance differences. Feeding 6 times per day did result in a small, but significant, reduction in skin and vulva lesions and structural-problem scores, while increasing vocalization.

40|$|Title of the paper: Influence of animal/feeder-trough space ratio on health, {{behaviour}} {{and performance}} of group housed sows fed ad libitum The EU-Directive on the "Minimum requirements {{for the protection of}} pigs" prohibits the housing of <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> in individual crates. One alternative to individual housing of restricted fed sows is group-housing with ad libitum access to feed. The proposed animal/feeder-trough space ratio of 4 : 1 in the German legislation was taken from housing systems for growing pigs {{due to a lack of}} scientific data on sow to feeder-trough space ratios. The aim of this study was to evaluate practically meaningful animal/feeder-trough space ratios with respect to animal welfare. Therefore, different animal/feeder-trough space ratios between 8 : 1 and 20 : 1 were investigated on three farms. The behaviour at the feeder, as well as health (body scoring), weight gain, back fat thickness and fertility were recorded in <b>gestating</b> <b>sows</b> between days 35 and 110 of pregnancy. The frequency of aggressive interactions and displacements at the feeder was progressively reduced in all tests after grouping the sows. Furthermore, the results pointed out that narrowing the animal/feeder-trough space ratio positively influenced both the conditioning of the sows before lactation and birth weights of the piglets. No clear trend between the different animal/feeder-trough space ratios of group-housed sows was found for the total number born, live and dead born piglets. A small number of sows showed minor injuries, which are not unusual for group housing systems. The evaluated animal/feeder-trough space ratios did not show indications of an impaired well-being of the sows. Our data do not support the legal demand for a threshold of 4 : 1 for the animal/feeder-trough space ratio. However, further studies with varying group sizes, group densities and animal/feeder-trough space ratios are needed in order to provide detailed recommendations on acceptable ratios...|$|R

Phosphorus content was determined and excretion in the feces (in g/d, g/kg DMI, and g/(kg BW·d)) was calculated using titanium dioxide as indigestible marker. In GF pigs, the fecal P excretion (g/d) decreased over time from the first to the third collection period (P < 0. 001). Fecal P excretion (g/d) increased with increasing FL in both GF pigs (P < 0. 001) and sows (P = 0. 003). In sows, the fecal P excretion was approximately 2 times higher compared to GF pigs in the third collection period, 499 versus 237 mg/kg DMI.
