40|$|Serotonergic anorexigens are {{the primary}} pharmacologic risk factor {{associated}} with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and the resulting PAH is clinically indistinguishable from the heritable form of disease, associated with BMPR 2 mutations. Both BMPR 2 mutation and agonists to the serotonin receptor HTR 2 B {{have been shown to}} cause activation of SRC tyrosine kinase; conversely, antagonists to HTR 2 B inhibit SRC trafficking and downstream function. To test the hypothesis that a HTR 2 B antagonist can prevent BMRP 2 mutation induced PAH by restricting aberrant SRC trafficking and <b>downstream</b> <b>activity,</b> we exposed BMPR 2 mutant mice, which spontaneously develop PAH, to a HTR 2 B antagonist, SB 204741, to block the SRC activation caused by BMPR 2 mutation. SB 204741 prevented the development of PAH in BMPR 2 mutant mice, reduced recruitment of inflammatory cells to their lungs, and reduced muscularization of their blood vessels. By atomic force microscopy, we determined that BMPR 2 mutant mice normally had a doubling of vessel stiffness, which was substantially normalized by HTR 2 B inhibition. SB 204741 reduced SRC phosphorylation and <b>downstream</b> <b>activity</b> in BMPR 2 mutant mice. Gene expression arrays indicate that the primary changes were in cytoskeletal and muscle contractility genes. These results were confirmed by gel contraction assays showing that HTR 2 B inhibition nearly normalizes the 400 % increase in gel contraction normally seen in BMPR 2 mutant smooth muscle cells.

40|$|The {{transition}} to services is analyzed for the <b>downstream</b> <b>activities</b> of the West-European automotive industry. The research builds upon theory on the {{transition to}} product related services. The value system of the automotive industry is identified as a value network for the <b>downstream</b> <b>activities.</b> A multiple case study research design is used by investigating an OEM (BMW) and three fleet management companies (Athlon, Alphabet and LeasePlan). The interview data was coded and analyzed using ATLAS TI. The data was analyzed by mapping network views and co-occurrence tables. The economic trend of differentiation into services {{is found to be}} highly relevant and is considered central to the structural changes in the <b>downstream</b> <b>activities</b> of the automotive industry. The growing needs of customers related to mobility bring challenges as well as opportunities for OEMs and fleet management companies. Following the data analysis, the changes in the value creation structure today are based on transitions in the core business, technological developments and a changing customer behavior (from car ownership to car usage). These transitions are mainly driven by a trend of urbanization and changing customer needs of the next generation (generation Y). These transitions {{have a significant impact on}} the future landscape of the automotive industry. Value will increasingly be added by actors in the <b>downstream</b> <b>activities</b> of the automotive industry through differentiation into services (e. g. MaaS and PaaS).

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of vertical integration and confronts some of the predictions of the leading approach to the internal organization of the firm with data from the UK manufacturing sector. Consistent with the theory, it shows that an upsteam and <b>downstream</b> <b>activity</b> pair {{are more likely to}} be vertically integrated, when the downstream (the producer) is more technology intensive and the upstream (the supplier) is less technology intensive. Also consistent with the theory, the magnitude of both effects are substantially amplified when the upstream inputs are an important fraction of the total costs of the downstream producer. These results are generally robust and hold with a variety of alternative measures of technology intensity, with alternative estimation strategies, and with or without controlling for a number of firm and industry-level characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{coupling}} of inhibitory interneurons can synchronize activity {{across multiple}} neurons, thereby enhancing {{the reliability of}} inhibition onto principal cell targets. It is unclear whether <b>downstream</b> <b>activity</b> in principal cells controls the excitability of such inhibitory networks. Using paired patch-clamp recordings, we show that excitatory projection neurons (fusiform cells) and inhibitory stellate interneurons of the dorsal cochlear nucleus form an electrically coupled network via connexin 36 -containing gap junctions. Remarkably, stellate cells were more strongly coupled to fusiform cells than to other stellate cells. This heterologous coupling was functionally asymmetric, biasing electrical transmission from principal cell to interneuron. Optogenetically-activated populations of fusiform cells reliably enhanced interneuron excitability and generated GABAergic inhibition onto postsynaptic targets of stellate cells, whereas deep afterhyperpolarizations following fusiform cell spike trains potently inhibited stellate cells over several hundred milliseconds. Thus, the excitability of an interneuron network is bi-directionally-controlled by distinct epochs of activity in principal cells...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{elaboration}} of nascent synaptic connections into highly ordered neural circuits {{is an integral}} feature of the developing vertebrate nervous system. In sensory systems, patterned spontaneous activity {{before the onset of}} sensation is thought to influence this process, but this conclusion remains controversial, largely due to the inherent difficulty recording neural activity in early development. Here, we describe genetic and pharmacological manipulations of spontaneous retinal activity, assayed in vivo, that demonstrate a causal link between retinal waves and visual circuit refinement. We also report a decoupling of <b>downstream</b> <b>activity</b> in retinorecipient regions of the developing brain after retinal wave disruption. Significantly, we show that the spatiotemporal characteristics of retinal waves affect the development of specific visual circuits. These results conclusively establish retinal waves as necessary and instructive for circuit refinement in the developing nervous system and reveal how neural circuits adjust to altered patterns of activity prior to experience...|$|E

While evidence for agglomeration (in the sense of “excess ” concentration relative to the size of MSAs and the size distribution of research labs) of research in these fields is mixed, we do find strong evidence of co-location of upstream and <b>downstream</b> <b>activity.</b> We view such co-located vertically connected activities as constituents of a “local innovation system, ” and these appear to vary markedly in their ability to convert local academic research into local commercial innovation.

40|$|Reduced {{generation}} of multiple motile cilia (RGMC) {{is a rare}} mucociliary clearance disorder. Affected persons suffer from recurrent infections of upper and lower airways because of highly reduced numbers of multiple motile respiratory cilia. Here we report recessive loss-of-function and missense mutations in MCIDAS-encoding Multicilin, which was shown to promote the early steps of multiciliated cell differentiation in Xenopus. MCIDAS mutant respiratory epithelial cells carry {{only one or two}} cilia per cell, which lack ciliary motility-related proteins (DNAH 5; CCDC 39) as seen in primary ciliary dyskinesia. Consistent with this finding, FOXJ 1 -regulating axonemal motor protein expression is absent in respiratory cells of MCIDAS mutant individuals. CCNO, when mutated known to cause RGMC, is also absent in MCIDAS mutant respiratory cells, consistent with its <b>downstream</b> <b>activity.</b> Thus, our findings identify Multicilin as a key regulator of CCNO/FOXJ 1 for human multiciliated cell differentiation, and highlight the 5 q 11 region containing CCNO and MCIDAS as a locus underlying RGMC. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Overlapping {{activities}} that are traditionally performed in a sequential manner can significantly reduce project delivery times. Overlapping, however, should be approached in a systematic manner to reduce the costs and risks. Information gathered from sector-based case studies and from the manufacturing domain suggest a formalised framework for identifying overlapping opportunities and strategies can be successfully implemented for infrastructure projects. This framework considers activity characteristics, such as evolution of upstream information and sensitivity of <b>downstream</b> <b>activities</b> to changes in upstream information, to identify appropriate overlapping strategies. Overlapping strategies, such as early freezing of design criteria, overdesign, and early release of preliminary information, are selected based on activity characteristics. These strategies operate either by speeding up the evolution of upstream information or by reducing the sensitivity of <b>downstream</b> <b>activities.</b> By aligning overlapping strategies with activity characteristics, project managers can make better decisions on when {{and how much to}} overlap sequential activities to reduce overall project delivery time.
