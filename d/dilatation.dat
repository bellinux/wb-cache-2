5|$|Ultrasound of {{the liver}} and biliary tree is often used as the initial imaging {{modality}} in patients with suspected obstructive jaundice. Ultrasound can identify obstruction and ductal <b>dilatation</b> and, in some cases, may be sufficient to diagnose cholangiocarcinoma.

5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{definitively}} diagnosed from tissue, i.e. it {{is proven}} by biopsy or examination of the tissue excised at surgery. It may be suspected in a patient with obstructive jaundice. Considering it as the working diagnosis may be challenging in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); such patients {{are at high risk}} of developing cholangiocarcinoma, but the symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from those of PSC. Furthermore, in patients with PSC, such diagnostic clues as a visible mass on imaging or biliary ductal <b>dilatation</b> may not be evident.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Ravel {{began to}} suffer pain from his condition, and was {{examined}} by Clovis Vincent, a well-known Paris neurosurgeon. Vincent advised surgical treatment. He thought a tumour unlikely, {{and expected to}} find ventricular <b>dilatation</b> that surgery might prevent from progressing. Ravel's brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the patient was in no state to express a considered view. After the operation {{there seemed to be}} an improvement in his condition, but it was short-lived, and he soon lapsed into a coma. He died on 28 December, at the age of 62.|$|E

From 1980 until 1988, 248 patients met the following criteria: (1) at least two lesions dilated (range: 2 to 4) and (2) all attempted lesions successfully dilated. The mean length of follow-up was 33 months. The end points analyzed were death, myocardial infarction, redilatation, and bypass surgery. No differences were found for these events between the single-vessel multilesion group (144 patients) and the multivessel group (104 patients).

5|$|Medical student Georges Garoyan {{published}} a thesis on Calment {{when she was}} 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with athropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed {{the presence of the}} DR1 allele, common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial <b>dilatation</b> and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.|$|E

25|$|The exact {{role that}} these risk factors {{play in the}} process leading to rupture is unclear. Aortic root <b>dilatation</b> {{is thought to be}} due to a mesenchymal defect as {{pathological}} evidence of cystic medial necrosis has been found by several studies. The association between a similar defect and aortic <b>dilatation</b> is well established in such conditions such as Marfan syndrome. Also, abnormalities in other mesenchymal tissues (bone matrix and lymphatic vessels) suggests a similar primary mesenchymal defect in patients with Turner syndrome. However, no evidence suggests that patients with Turner syndrome have a significantly higher risk of aortic <b>dilatation</b> and dissection in absence of predisposing factors. So, the risk of aortic dissection in Turner syndrome appears to be a consequence of structural cardiovascular malformations and hemodynamic risk factors rather than a reflection of an inherent abnormality in connective tissue. The natural history of aortic root <b>dilatation</b> is unknown, but because of its lethal potential, this aortic abnormality needs to be carefully followed.|$|E
25|$|Cardiovascular malformations (typically {{bicuspid}} aortic valve, coarctation of the aorta, {{and some}} other left-sided cardiac malformations) and hypertension predispose to aortic <b>dilatation</b> and dissection in the general population. Indeed, these same risk factors are found in more than 90% of patients with Turner syndrome who develop aortic <b>dilatation.</b> Only {{a small number of}} patients (around 10%) have no apparent predisposing risk factors. The risk of hypertension is increased three-fold in patients with Turner syndrome. Because of its relation to aortic dissection, blood pressure must be regularly monitored and hypertension should be treated aggressively with an aim to keep blood pressure below 140/80 mmHg. As with the other cardiovascular malformations, complications of aortic <b>dilatation</b> is commonly associated with 45,X karyotype.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To explore {{ovariole}} {{basal body}} granulations and follicular <b>dilatations</b> for determining physiological age in Anopheles gambiae s. s. (An. gambiae s. s.). Methods: Mosquitoes {{were collected by}} using window trap catch and identified morphologically. For the first lot of mosquitoes, they were dissected, and ovary was left in distilled water for reading ovarian tracheoles and the second was cut and transferred to another blade in a physiological liquid for verification of ovariole basal body granulations. The same approach was followed with the second lot of mosquitoes where follicular <b>dilatations</b> were found after classic dilaceration of ovaries were transferred into physiological liquid. The other body parts of mosquitoes were used to identify the species of the An. gambiae s. s. complex by PCR. Results: Among the 123 An. gambiae s. s. of the first lot, the method of Detinova determined the age of 89 mosquitoes versus 114 for the observation of granulations (P > 0. 05). Among the 112 An. gambiae s. s. of the second lot, the method of Detinova determined the age of 84 mosquitoes versus 93 for the observation of follicular <b>dilatations</b> (P > 0. 05). Unlike the method of Detinova, observation of follicular <b>dilatations</b> and basal body granulations of ovarioles were possible beyond the stage II Christophers. Conclusions: Overall, the observation of follicular <b>dilatations</b> and ovariole basal body granulations are reliable for {{the determination of the}} physiological age in An. gambiae s. s.
