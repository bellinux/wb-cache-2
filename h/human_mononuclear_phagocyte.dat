Labeled monocytes are being used for investigation of pathogenesis like atherosclerosis and for monitoring of therapeutic intervention in inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.

Monocytes labeled before their final differentiation into macrophages or dendritic cells may reveal centers of inflammation in a patient and, thereby, contribute to scintigraphic diagnosis. Macrophages or dendritic cells may be in vitro cultured and by means of genetic transformation specified towards specific targets prior to re-injection, an approach with therapeutic potency.

No appreciable levels of 6 -keto-PGF 1 alpha were observed. These data were confirmed using specific radioimmunoassays for TxB 2, PGE 2 and 6 -keto-PGF 1 alpha. Blood monocytes and bronchoalveolar macrophages were the poorest producers of PG, {{with the possible exception of}} PGD 2 in bronchoalveolar macrophages.

Direct, antibody-independent tumoricidal activity was measured against the murine TU 5 line pre-labelled with 3 H-thymidine. All mononuclear phagocyte populations tested were similarly effective in mediating ADCC against TLX 9 cells. In the absence of deliberate stimulation blood monocytes and peritoneal macrophages had appreciable spontaneous cytotoxicity against the susceptible TU 5 line. In contrast, four out of 10 milk macrophage preparations lacked detectable spontaneous killing activity on this target. In vitro exposure to partially purified fibroblast interferon (IFN) or to lymphokine supernatants from PHA stimulated lymphocytes augmented the direct tumoricidal activity of blood monocytes and peritoneal exudate macrophages. Milk macrophages were completely unresponsive to IFN and lymphokines. therefore the capacity to mediate antibody-dependent and -independent cytotoxicity against tumour cells can be dissociated to some extent in <b>human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocyte</b> populations from diverse anatomical sites...|$|E

The number of CSF- 1 receptors {{on the surface of}} transformed cells was regulated by ligand-induced receptor degradation and was inversely proportional to the quantity of CSF- 1 produced. A tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutation at position 969 near the receptor carboxyl terminus potentiated its transforming efficiency in cells cotransfected by the CSF- 1 gene but did not affect receptor downmodulation. CSF- 1 was synthesized as an integral transmembrane glycoprotein that was rapidly dimerized through disulfide bonds. The homodimer was externalized at the cell surface, where it underwent proteolysis to yield the soluble growth factor. Trypsin treatment of viable cells cleaved the plasma membrane form of CSF- 1 to molecules of a size indistinguishable from that of the extracellular growth factor, suggesting that trypsinlike proteases regulate the rate of CSF- 1 release from transformed cells.

40|$|Human {{mononuclear}} phagocytes {{were isolated}} from peripheral blood, peritoneal exudate and early lactation milk by adherence on microexudate-coated plastic {{and exposure to}} ethylene diamine tetracetic acid. Their cytolytic activity was measured as 3 H-thymidine release from prelabelled target cells over 48 - 72 hr and cytostasis was evaluated in a spectrophotometric 72 -hr assay. The murine SV 40 -transformed mKSA-TU 5 line and the human E cell line, derived from an ovarian carcinoma, were employed as targets. Peripheral blood monocytes, in vitro-matured monocyte-derived macrophages, peritoneal macrophages and milk macrophages were all significantly cytolytic and cytostatic on these target cells at attacker to target cell ratios ranging from 5 : 1 to 40 : 1. When monocytes were cultivated in vitro, no loss of cytocidal capacity occurred over the first 10 days of culture, whereas later on, when epithelioid and giant cells predominate in the cultures, mononuclear phagocytes had little cytotoxic activity. Adherent cells obtained from cord blood or from the peripheral blood of old donors had natural cytotoxicity similar to monocytes obtained from young adult volunteers. Peripheral blood monocytes and peritoneal macrophages showed enhanced cytolytic activity after exposure to partially purified human fibroblast interferon. These experiments suggest that in the <b>human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocyte</b> series cytotoxicity on tumour cells is not restricted to circulating monocytes but is also expressed by macrophages obtained from diverse anatomical sites...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} {{various stages of}} <b>human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocyte</b> maturation, we {{cultivated}} bone marrow in an in vitro diffusion chamber with the cells growing in suspension and upon a dialysis membrane. At 2, 7, and 14 days, the cultured cells were examined by electron microscopy and cytochemical techniques for peroxidase and for more limited analysis of acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase. Peroxidase was being synthesized in promonocytes of 2 - and 7 -day cultures, as evidenced by reaction product in the rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, and storage granules. Peroxidase synthesis had ceased in monocytes and the enzyme appeared only in some granules. By 7 days, large macrophages predominated, containing numerous peroxidase-positive storage granules, and heterophagy of dying cells was evident. By 14 days, the most prevalent cell type was the large peroxidase-negative macrophage. Thus, peroxidase is present in high concentrations in immature cells but absent at later stages, presumably a result of degranulation of peroxidase-positive storage granules. Clusters of peroxidase-negative macrophages with indistinct borders (epithelioid cells), as well as obvious multinucleated giant cells, were noted. Frequently, the interdigitating plasma membranes of neighboring macrophages showed a modification resembling a septate junction [...] to our knowledge, representing the first documentation of this specialized cell contact between normal macrophages.

40|$|The human immune {{response}} to Mycobacterium tuberculosis {{is not well}} characterized. To better understand the cellular {{immune response}} to tuberculosis, a <b>human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocyte</b> culture system using a low-infecting inoculum of M. tuberculosis to mimic in vivo conditions was developed. Using this system, monocytes treated with IFNgamma/TNFalpha/ calcitriol (CytD) were permissive {{for the growth of}} virulent M. tuberculosis. In the presence of iron, however, these monocytes suppressed the growth of M. tuberculosis. The enhanced permissiveness of CytD-preincubated monocytes was found to be due to TNFalpha, however, the ability of iron to suppress M. tuberculosis growth also required preincubation with TNFalpha. Iron-mediated growth suppression was correlated with selective suppression of TNFalpha release from infected monocytes. In addition, removal of TNFalpha from CytD-treated monocytes 2 d after infection mimicked the suppressive effect of iron, suggesting that iron may also be decreasing monocyte sensitivity to exogenously added TNFalpha. In the absence of iron, permissive, CytD-treated monocytes formed large infected cellular aggregates. With iron treatment, aggregation was suppressed, suggesting that the iron-suppressive effect on M. tuberculosis growth may be related to suppression of monocyte aggregation and diminished cell-to-cell spread of M. tuberculosis. The results {{of this study indicate that}} TNFalpha preincubation is required for human monocytes to exert an iron-mediated suppressive effect on M. tuberculosis growth. In the absence of iron, however, the continued presence of TNFalpha has a growth-promoting effect on M. tuberculosis in human monocytes.

40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocytes</b> can be {{activated}} {{to perform a}} variety of complex functions by exposure to the immunomodulators, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). Although such activation often involves the release of various cytokines by monocytes and macrophages, little is known {{of the effects of}} such signals on their secretion of lysozyme (LZM). In this study, a reverse haemolytic plaque assay for LZM secretion is coupled with immunocytochemistry for the pan macrophage (CD 68) marker, EBM/ 11. This enabled the direct effects of LPS, IFN-gamma and TNF alpha on the secretion of LZM by individual, immunoidentified <b>human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocytes</b> to be investigated. The overall secretion of this peptide by populations of freshly isolated or 3 -day cultured monocytes was augmented by exposure for 6 hr to bacterial LPS, recombinant human IFN-gamma or recombinant human TNF alpha. Extension of the culture period for monocytes from 3 to 7 days prior to use in the assay resulted in higher levels of LZM secretion, which could be further increased by TNF alpha but not by LPS or IFN-gamma. Individual peritoneal macrophages activated by inflammation in vivo were uniform in their augmented LZM responses to TNF alpha, but a small subpopulation of human peritoneal macrophages, which may represent younger 'inflammatory' exudate macrophages, was seen to be preferentially responsive to the LZM-stimulating effects of LPS and IFN-gamma. These studies suggest that (i) secretion of LZM by <b>human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocytes</b> can be regulated by LPS and IFN-gamma, although the effects of these agents may be dependent upon the state of maturation and/or differentiation of the cells, and (ii) TNF alpha is a potent stimulant of LZM secretion by monocytes and macrophages irrespective of cell maturity...|$|R

40|$|On {{exposure}} to endotoxin and other stimuli, human peripheral-blood mononuclear cells generate a potent procoagulant activity (PCA), identified as tissue factor. Although {{it is now}} recognized that the monocytes {{are the source of}} PCA, the question whether these cells per se are capable of procoagulant response to endotoxin or require lymphocyte collaboration remains unsettled. We have investigated the capacity of highly purified human macrophages from diverse anatomical sites to generate PCA following endotoxin stimulation. Purified (greater than 99 %) monocyte-derived macrophages were obtained by prolonged (3 - 10 days) in-vitro culture of adherent monocytes using medium supplemented with 50 % human serum. Purified (greater than 95 %) peritoneal and milk macrophages were isolated by adherence to plastic. PCA was measured before and after incubation (4 hr at 37 degrees) with endotoxin (Salmonella enteritidis LPS, W or Escherichia coli O 111 :B 4 LPS, W, 1 microgram/ml final concentration) using a one-stage clotting assay and/or a two-stage amidolytic assay. Monocyte-derived macrophages had low baseline PCA (14 - 19 units/ 10 (5) cells) but, upon {{exposure to}} endotoxin, displayed an eight-fold increase in PCA over control. Peritoneal and milk macrophages expressed very low baseline activity (1 - 5 units/ 10 (5) cells). The latter, however, increased 15 - 20 times over control following endotoxin stimulation. PCA was identified as tissue factor by biological and immunological criteria. Its generation was completely abolished by cycloheximide. It is concluded that in the <b>human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocyte</b> series the capacity to produce PCA is not restricted to circulating monocytes but is also expressed by macrophages obtained from diverse anatomical sites.

40|$|Tissue-resident macrophages (MΦ) such as microglia, Kupffer and Langerhans cells {{derive from}} Myb-independent yolk sac (YS) {{progenitors}} generated before {{the emergence of}} hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Myb-independent YS-derived resident MΦ self-renew locally, independently of circulating adult monocytes and HSCs. In contrast, adult blood monocytes as well as infiltrating, gut and dermal MΦ derive from Myb-dependent HSCs and are less proliferative. These findings are derived from the mouse, using gene knock-outs and lineage tracing, but their applicability to human development has not been formally demonstrated. Here I use a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) differentiation model of hematopoiesis, capable of monocyte/MΦ production over prolonged periods of time, {{as a tool to}} investigate <b>human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocyte</b> ontogeny. Using a transcriptomic approach I showed that hiPSC-derived monocytes/MΦ (iPS-Mo/MΦ) produced early in differentiation (first weeks) are more proliferative and less immunologically mature than iPS-Mo/MΦ produced at a later time point. I therefore hypothesised either that iPS-Mo/MΦ only become fully mature after several weeks of differentiation or that there are two developmentally distinct waves of MΦ produced over time. By comparing the transcription profile of iPS-Mo/MΦs to that of primary adult blood monocytes and fetal microglia I then showed that early and late iPS-Mo/MΦs were transcriptionally closer to fetal microglia than to adult blood monocytes. To further investigate if iPS-Mo/MΦs are indeed of the same developmental origin as MYB-independent MΦ such as microglia, I used a CRISPR-Cas 9 knock-out strategy to show for the first time, that human iPS-Mo/MΦs develop in a MYB-independent, RUNX 1 and SPI 1 (PU. 1) -dependent fashion. This result makes human iPS-Mo/MΦs developmentally related to, and a good model for, MYB-independent tissue-resident such as alveolar and kidney MΦs, microglia, Kupffer and Langerhans cells. Interestingly, while MYB was not required for the generation of iPS-Mo/MΦs, its knock-out resulted in an increase in iPS-Mo/MΦ production. To investigate this increase I developed two methods for quantifying the differentiation bottleneck occurring during hiPSC differentiation to iPS-Mo/MΦs. Those techniques highlighted a potential increase in progenitor cell generation in MYB KO cells and thus lay foundation to improve our technical understanding of EB differentiation and will enable enhanced manipulation of the EB model. </p...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{demethylation}} processes {{have been}} studied {{for many years and}} entered the focus of extensive research with the discovery of active demethylation mechanisms (He et al., 2011; Ito et al., 2011; Iyer et al., 2009; Kriaucionis and Heintz, 2009; Tahiliani et al., 2009). These processes contribute to the regulation of cell type-specific gene expression patterns and the dynamics of other epigenetic mechanisms (Wu and Zhang, 2014). The investigation of the different types of mechanisms and their role in different cell types or developmental stages is an important challenge to understand the complex regulatory processes in mammals. The data presented in this work allowed further insights into the active demethylation processes and contributed to the understanding of regulatory mechanisms in different hematopoietic cell types. Using an in vitro model system, representing the <b>human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocyte</b> system, we were able to characterize the active DNA demethylation mechanism in the absence of passive demethylation events. The data revealed that the targeted, locus-specific active DNA demethylation process is initiated by the modification of 5 mC to 5 hmC. Further experiments based on the knockdown of candidate enzymes identified TET 2 as the initiator of the active DNA demethylation process and as being responsible for the conversion of 5 mC to 5 hmC. Investigation of further possible players like TDG, MBD 4, OGT, and HELLS gave first insights into a possible contribution to the process and so far the data indicated that none of the enzymes is involved in the first conversion step. Functional investigation of the demethylated regions in reporter gene assays linked the local binding of TFs like PU. 1 and synchronous demethylation events to the activation of potential enhancer elements. The data demonstrated that their activation depended on the methylation level and that demethylation led to enhancer activation in a cell type-specific manner. Moreover the results indicated that the activation of cell type-specific enhancer elements requires a corresponding set of TF to open the regions, which may include the removal of 5 mC in this process. The validation and adaption of a 5 hmC-enrichment method to next generation sequencing allowed us to investigate the active demethylation processes on a genome-wide level. Using the Hydroxymethyl CollectorTM kit we assessed the global dynamics of DNA demethylation and its association with the key hematopoietic transcription factor PU. 1 in differentiating monocytes. The global screen illustrated dynamic patterns of 5 hmC and confirmed its role as an intermediate of active demethylation events accompanying the transition into another cell type. Local binding of PU. 1 at demethylated sites further supported the theory of a correlation between demethylation events and the recruitment of PU. 1. However, active DNA demethylation events were not altogether dependent on PU. 1 binding, since several regions accumulated 5 hmC in the absence of this TF, indicating the involvement of other factors and thus a site-specific recruitment of PU. 1. The data further hinted at a possible regulatory role of 5 hmC as an epigenetic mark, actively recruiting or passively impeding other factors. Further gene ontology analyses confirmed the immunological background of the cells and presented genes involved in the immune response and inflammation to be associated with active demethylation processes and the local appearance of PU. 1. Corresponding expression changes suggested an involvement of PU. 1 in the regulation of transcriptional changes during monocyte differentiation. However, regions with increasing or stable 5 hmC levels displayed transcriptional changes independent of demethylation or PU. 1 and supported the involvement of other factors in their regulation as well as possible regulatory functions of 5 hmC. A global screen of PU. 1 distribution in differentiating monocytes illustrated dynamic PU. 1 binding patterns upon the transition into another cell type and confirmed the association with demethylation events at subsets of PU. 1 target regions. Comparing the 5 hmC and PU. 1 dynamics during monocyte differentiation we presented first evidence for a distinct chronology of PU. 1 and demethylation events. In a subset of PU. 1 target regions demethylation was present in monocytes but recruited PU. 1 primarily on the transition into a new cell type. It is still unclear, if PU. 1 generally profits from the opening of demethylated regions or if it administrates various functions at different target regions. The localization of the PU. 1 patterns to active, cell type-specific regulatory elements revealed distinct distribution dynamics during cell differentiation. PU. 1 is mainly targeted to promoter and promoter-distal regulatory regions that are activated in a cell type-specific manner. The active nature of the regions supported an involvement of PU. 1 in hematopoietic cell differentiation. PU. 1 binding was associated with marginally dynamic, demethylated states and indicated a role for PU. 1 in the maintenance of an active transcriptional state or its independent recruitment to demethylated regulatory regions. In summary the data presented in this work contributed {{to the understanding of the}} active DNA demethylation mechanism and revealed dynamic global association of demethylation events and PU. 1 binding accompanying cell fate decisions in hematopoietic cells...|$|E

Since intestine lamina propria is rich in macrophages, we studied the effect of toxin B on human monocytes and on human macrophages generated in vitro by long-term culture of purified circulating blood monocytes. Upon addition of toxin B, human monocytes exhibited few modifications whereas macrophages adopted a stellate morphology, with rounding up of the perikaryon. Toxin B made microfilaments of actin disappear and induced an important reorganization of vimentin and a redistribution of tubulin. Membrane area increased by approximately 16 %.

Finally, the combined treatment of monocytes with gamma interferon and toxin B increased significantly the secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha, whereas toxin B alone was unable to induce tumor necrosis factor production. These results suggest that morphological and functional alterations induced in <b>human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocytes</b> by toxin B from C. difficile are due to the disorganization of the cytoskeleton and the resulting impairment of the membrane traffic equilibrium...|$|R

Suramin inhibited the proliferation of U 937 cells and mitogen-induced T-cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. The constitutive and cytokine-driven expression of Fc receptors for IgG (Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RII), IgE (Fc epsilon RII) and IgA (Fc alpha R) on blood monocytes and U 937 cells was suppressed by suramin. The basal level, as well as cytokine-induced major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens, was markedly diminished on suramin-treated monocytes. Furthermore, suramin dramatically reduced expression of CD 14 and partially reduced complement receptor type 3 (CR 3) and CR 4 expression on monocytes. In contrast, suramin slightly induced MHC class I antigens on monocytes and CD 71 on U 937 cells. The capacity of monocytes to phagocytose IgG-sensitized ox erythrocytes, opsonized Escherichia coli, or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -conjugated latex beads was significantly inhibited. Northern blot analysis showed that the amount of Fc epsilon RII-specific mRNA was only partially reduced, suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved in the regulation of Fc epsilon RII expression.

LPS increased C 3 synthesis 5 - 30 -fold without affecting the kinetics of secretion of C 3 or the synthesis of C 2, lysozyme, or total protein. Factor B synthesis was consistently increased by LPS. Experiments with lipid A-inactivated LPS (alkaline treated), LPS from a polysaccharide mutant strain, and lipid X (a lipid A precursor) indicated that the lipid A portion is the structural element required for this effect. Northern blot analysis demonstrated at least a fivefold increase in C 3 mRNA in LPS-treated monolayers, which suggests that the regulation of the increase in C 3 synthesis is pretranslational. C 2 mRNA and factor B mRNA were increased approximately twofold. The availability of specific gene products in <b>human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocytes</b> that respond to LPS should permit understanding of the molecular regulation of more complex functions of these cells elicited by LPS in which multiple gene products are coordinately expressed...|$|R

Antibody bind-ing was detected by indirect immunofluorescence in conventional microscopy and flow microfluorometry. Through additive experiments, competitive blocking ex-periments and differences in the distribution histograms of immunofluorescence, evidence was obtained that each antibody detected a distinct antigenic determinant. Different increases in the amount of each antigen and in the frequency of positive cells were found on fluid or tissue macrophages when compared to blood mono-cytes.

40|$|Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) {{promotes}} <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocyte</b> {{survival and}} proliferation. The transcription factor Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-kB) {{is a key}} regulator of genes involved in M-CSF-induced <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocyte</b> survival and this study focused at identifying the mechanism of NF-kB transcriptional activation. Here, we demonstrate that M-CSF stimulated NF-kB transcriptional activity in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264. 7. The general protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Ro- 31 - 8220, the conventional PKCa/b inhibitor Gö- 6976, overexpression of dominant negative PKCa constructs and PKCa siRNA reduced NF-kB activity in response to M-CSF. Interestingly, Ro- 31 - 8220 reduced Ser 276 phosphorylation of NF-kBp 65 leading to decreased M-CSF-induced monocyte survival. In this report, we identify conventional PKCs, including PKCa as important upstream kinases for M-CSF-induced NF-kB transcriptional activation, NF-kB-regulated gene expression, NF-kB p 65 Ser 276 phosphorylation, and macrophage survival. Lastly, we find that NF-kB p 65 Ser 276 {{plays an important role}} in basal and M-CSF-stimulated NF-kB activation in <b>human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocytes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{thioredoxin}} (Trx) {{system of}} Mycobacterium leprae is {{expressed as a}} single hybrid protein containing thioredoxin reductase (TR) at its N terminus and Trx at its C terminus. This hybrid Trx system is unique to M. leprae, since in all other organisms studied to date, including other mycobacteria, both TR and Trx are expressed as two separate proteins. Because Trx {{has been shown to}} scavenge reactive oxygen species, we have investigated whether the TR-Trx gene product can inhibit oxygen-dependent killing of mycobacteria by <b>human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocytes</b> and as such could contribute to mycobacterial virulence. The gene encoding M. leprae TR-Trx was cloned into the apathogenic, fast-growing bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis. Recombinant M. smegmatis containing the gene encoding TR-Trx was killed to a significantly lesser extent than M. smegmatis containing the identical vector with either no insert or a control M. leprae construct unrelated to TR-Trx. Upon phagocytosis, M. smegmatis was shown to be killed predominantly by oxygen-dependent macrophage-killing mechanisms. Coinfection of M. smegmatis expressing the gene encoding TR-Trx together with Staphylococcus aureus, which is known to be killed via oxygen-dependent microbicidal mechanisms, revealed that the TR-Trx gene product interferes with the intracellular killing of this bacterium. A similar coinfection with Streptococcus pyogenes, known to be killed by oxygen-independent mechanisms, showed that the TR-Trx gene product did not influence the oxygen-independent killing pathway. The data obtained in this study suggest that the Trx system of M. leprae can inhibit oxygen-dependent killing of intracellular bacteria and thus may represent one of the mechanisms by which M. leprae can deal with oxidative stress within <b>human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocytes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Polymorph {{migration}} stimulator (PMS) is a peptide factor {{produced by}} an in vitro reaction between glucocorticoids and <b>human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocytes.</b> This study was undertaken {{to determine the}} significance of the stimulatory effect of PMS on the capillary tube migration of human polymorphs. Colchicine, vinblastine and Nocodazole, all of which inhibit microtubular assembly, are shown to stimulate migration. Conversely, deuterium oxide which stabilizes microtubules inhibits migration. Increased intracellular cyclic AMP is associated with microtubular inhibition and isoprenaline, theophylline and dibutyryl cyclic AMP are also found to stimulate capillary tube migration. These results suggest that PMS acts by inhibiting the assembly of polymorph microtubules, an effect which may be mediated by cyclic AMP {{in the same manner as}} other peptide hormones...|$|R
40|$|During {{the course}} of our studies on the lipid {{composition}} of macrophage membranes, it was noted that 25 % of the total fatty acid content of this cell was composed of arachidonie acid (20 : 4)) Similar values have been reported for both rabbit (1) and <b>human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocytes</b> (2), whereas the fatty acid complement of most other cell types rarely exceeds a few percent. This unusual enrichment with esterified 20 : 4 has focused attention on the ability of <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocytes</b> to produce prostaglandins (PG) from endogenous stores. PG, depending upon their structure, are thought to play a variety of important roles in the initiation and control of the inflammatory process (3). It is now well established that <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocytes</b> produce PG in response to a variety of stimuli that perturb their surface membranes. These include phagocytizable particulates such as zymosan (4) and immune complexes (5) or soluble agents such as phorbol myristate acetate and lipopolysaccharide (6, 7). Bonney et al. (4) have reported that the major synthetic product of mouse peritoneal cells is PGE with smaller amounts of 6 -oxo-PGFl...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} the in vitro activation of <b>human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocytes</b> by particulate Tamm Horsfall protein (THP). Peripheral blood monocytes phagocytosed THP particles with the accompanying release of superoxide radicals, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, and neutral metalloproteinase. Immunoprecipitation and substrate gel analysis identified the neutral proteinase as a 95 -kd gelatinase. A {{comparison with other}} particulate ligands highlighted the specificity of the response to THP and showed that {{the magnitude of the}} response was comparable with that obtained with lipopolysaccharide (100 micrograms/ml). Parallel studies using peritoneal macrophages resulted in a similar pattern of enzyme release and reactive oxygen species synthesis. THP has been implicated in the pathogenesis of tubulointerstitial nephritis associated with reflux nephropathy. The present study indicates that an inflammatory response initiated by a neutrophil-THP interaction may be extended into a chronic phase via the activation of <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocytes.</b> The subsequent release of reactive oxygen metabolites and proteinases may contribute to the tissue damage and fibrosis associated with chronic immune-mediated tubulointerstitial nephritis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCell surface sialoglycoproteins of <b>human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocytes</b> in {{different}} maturation stages were labelled by the periodate/borohydride method and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The main surface glycoproteins of peripheral blood monocytes had molecular masses of 115 and 95 kDa. During in vitro transition into adherent macrophages, the monocyte-characteristic surface glycoproteins disappeared. Most {{of the changes}} in the surface glycoprotein pattern occurred during the first 24 h and after 96 h the changes were completed. The major sialoglycoproteins of the macrophage cell surface had molecular masses of 130 and 55 kDa. The macrophage cell surface showed further changes when cultured in the presence of synovial fluid (10 %). These results may reflect the in vivo maturation of monocytes into tissue macrophages. In synovium, tissue-derived factors may also take part {{in different}}iatíon...|$|R
40|$|Few rodent {{models of}} human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type one (HIV- 1) infection can reflect the course of viral infection in humans. To this end, we investigated the relationships between progressive HIV- 1 infection, immune compromise, and neuroinflammatory responses in NOD/scid-IL- 2 Rγcnull mice reconstituted with human hematopoietic CD 34 + stem cells. Human blood-borne macrophages repopulated the meninges and perivascular spaces of chimeric animals. Viral infection in lymphoid tissue led to the accelerated entry of human cells into the brain, marked neuroinflammation, and HIV- 1 replication in <b>human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocytes.</b> A meningitis and less commonly an encephalitis followed cM-T 807 antibody-mediated CD 8 + cell depletion. We conclude that HIV- 1 –infected NOD/scid-IL- 2 Rγcnull humanized mice can, at least in part, recapitulate lentiviral neuropathobiology. This model of neuroAIDS reflects the virological, immunological, and early disease-associated neuropathological components of human disease...|$|R

The growth of bone marrow mononuclear cells in GCT-CM {{was dependent on}} {{the shape of the}} culture vessels, being increased in round-bottomed versus flat-bottomed wells. Proliferation was confined to nonadherent cells; like blood monocytes, bone marrow-derived macrophages did not incorporate [3 Hjthymidine in response to GCT-CM or human serum. Purified macrophages from this source expressed nonspecific esterase and OKM 1, OKIa, FMC 17, 32, and 34 and 25 F 9 antigens but lacked Mo 2. They expressed high levels of an inactivator of plasminogen activator, minactivin, and gave a substantial metabolic burst in response to phorbol myristate acetate or opsonized (but not unopsonized) zymosan. Bone marrow-derived macrophages acted as accessory cells in the response of T lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin.

Recently, FN {{has been shown to}} promote the attachment of immunogiobulin-coated erythrocytes to <b>human</b> <b>mononuclear</b> <b>phagocytes</b> (2).
