5|$|Abandoned {{by their}} father {{deep in a}} forest, young Hansel and Gretel enter a <b>gingerbread</b> house and are {{captured}} by a cannibalistic witch. The witch forces Hansel to continuously eat candy to fatten him up, and enslaves Gretel by ordering her to prepare the oven. The siblings outsmart her and incinerate her in the fire of the oven. In the fifteen years that follow, Hansel and Gretel become famed witch hunters, slaying hundreds of witches. The pair find that they are somehow immune to spells and curses, but the incident in the <b>gingerbread</b> house has left Hansel diabetic. He needs a shot of insulin every few hours or he will get sick and die.|$|E

5|$|English cookery has {{developed}} over many centuries {{since at least}} the time of The Forme of Cury, written in the Middle Ages around 1390 in the reign of King Richard II. The book offers imaginative and sophisticated recipes, with spicy sweet and sour sauces thickened with bread or quantities of almonds boiled, peeled, dried and ground, and often served in pastry. Foods such as <b>gingerbread</b> are described. It was not at all, emphasises Clarissa Dickson Wright in her A History of English Food, a matter of large lumps of roast meat at every meal as imagined in Hollywood films.|$|E

5|$|The husband, whose stained hands reveal he is a dyer by trade, looks harried as {{he carries}} his {{exhausted}} youngest daughter. In earlier impressions (and the painting), {{his hands are}} blue, to show his occupation, while his wife's face is coloured with red ink. The placement of the cow's horns behind his head represents him as a cuckold and suggests the children are not his. Behind the couple, their children replay the scene: the father's cane protrudes between the son's legs, doubling as a hobby horse, while the daughter is clearly in charge, demanding that he hand over his <b>gingerbread.</b> A limited number of proofs missing the girl and artist's signature were printed; Hogarth added the mocking girl to explain the boy's tears.|$|E
5|$|Hansel {{wakes up}} with Mina, who reveals {{herself to be}} a white witch. She heals his wounds again and uses a grimoire to bless Hansel's arsenal of weapons. Hansel, Mina, and Ben head out to disrupt the Blood Moon Sabbath. Mina begins {{slaughtering}} dark witches with a Gatling gun, while Hansel squares off against Muriel's witches and frees the children. Edward defies Muriel's orders and releases Gretel before Muriel throws him off the cliff. Muriel flees on a broomstick, but Ben manages to shoot her and forces her to crash. Hansel goes after Muriel while Gretel stops to revive Edward. Hansel, Ben, and Mina follow Muriel's trail to the original <b>gingerbread</b> house. Muriel wounds Ben and kills Mina before Hansel shoots her several times, knocking her into the house. Gretel arrives and the pair engage Muriel in a brutal fight that ends with Gretel decapitating her with a shovel. They burn Muriel's body on a pyre and collect their reward for rescuing the children. They head out on their next witch hunt accompanied by Ben and Edward.|$|E
5|$|In 1649, {{the town}} is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople {{try to figure out}} whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is {{entitled}} to due process which means she will be thrown off a cliff with a broomstick; if she is a witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities expect her to report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing that she really is a witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how the witches eat children, which gives them the notion to do just that. They knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers the witches <b>gingerbread</b> men instead. The witches like these better than the children so they go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating the children. As they fly off, the Sea Captain says that is how the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.|$|E

5|$|In Chocobo Racing, {{the player}} {{controls}} Final Fantasy-inspired characters, {{most of whom}} race in go-karts. Other characters fly, drive scooters, ride magic carpets, or even run. Players have five different racing modes to choose from: Story Mode, Versus Mode, Grand Prix, Relay Race, and Time Attack. In the Story Mode, players are guided through the story of Chocobo Racing, which is narrated by Cid, {{in the form of}} an onscreen version of a pop-up book. Players who complete the Story Mode are given the chance to customize their own racer; completing the Story Mode also unlocks secret character racers. In the Versus Mode, two players can race each other on a horizontally split screen, where one player races viewing the top half of the screen and the other player races viewing the bottom half. In Grand Prix (GP) Mode, the player races computer-controlled opponents in four selected tracks of his or her choice. In Relay Race Mode, the player chooses three racers to compete in a relay match. In Time Attack Mode, the player can select any stage and try to beat the fastest time record set there. There are ten track options: Cid's Test Track, Moogle Forest, The Ancient Gate, Mythril Mines, The Black Manor, Floating Gardens, <b>Gingerbread</b> Land, Vulcan-O Valley, Fantasia, and F.F.VIII Circuit.|$|E
5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, Hansel (Lord) and Gretel (Collins), {{are searching}} for {{kindling}} while their father (Lea) chops firewood. He gives Gretel a compass so they won't be separated, but when they return, he {{is nowhere to be}} found. As they search they run into The Evil Queen (Parrilla) and are captured. She tells the two that she can help find their father, on the condition that they retrieve an item belonging to her from The Blind Witch (Emma Caulfield). They must enter her <b>gingerbread</b> house when The Blind Witch is asleep and fetch The Evil Queen's leather satchel, but they must not eat a thing. They break in safely, but Hansel gives in to the temptation of taking a bite of a cupcake, causing The Blind Witch to wake up. While she cannot see the children, she can smell their scent. The Blind Witch locks them up and prepares the oven to roast them. The two, working together, are able to push the witch into her own oven as The Evil Queen, who is gleefully watching the events from her mirror, magically sends a bolt of fire through her mirror into the witch's oven, roasting her alive.|$|E
25|$|The <b>gingerbread</b> bakers were {{gathered}} into professional baker guilds. In many European countries <b>gingerbread</b> bakers were a distinct {{component of the}} bakers' guild. <b>Gingerbread</b> baking developed into an acknowledged profession. In the 17th century only professional <b>gingerbread</b> bakers were permitted to bake <b>gingerbread</b> except at Christmas and Easter, when anyone was allowed to bake it.|$|E

25|$|A <b>gingerbread</b> {{house does}} not have to be an actual house, {{although}} it is the most common. It can be anything from a castle to a small cabin, or another kind of building, such as a church, an art museum, or a sports stadium, and other items, such as cars, <b>gingerbread</b> men and <b>gingerbread</b> women, can be made of <b>gingerbread</b> dough.|$|E

60|$|Biscuits and <b>gingerbreads</b> {{were thrown}} among the people, the street boys stood on tiptoe crying hurrahs and {{whistling}} through their fingers. It was all splendid.|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{composition}} (moisture, ash, protein, fat, total carbohydrate, sucrose, fructose, glucose and maltose) of {{four types}} of biscuits and four <b>gingerbreads</b> were determined and moisture adsorption characteristics of samples were evaluated at 25 Â°C using the Novasina hygrometric technique. Generally, the GAB model gave the best description of the experimental sorption data; however, these findings {{were not statistically significant}} compared with the BET model. <b>Gingerbreads</b> absorbed higher amount of water (20 â€“ 25 g/ 100 g on dry weight basis) at a w> 0. 70 in comparison to biscuits studied mainly due to higher content of sucrose and/or other simple saccharides. Monolayer moisture content evaluated by BET and GAB models were in general higher for the <b>gingerbreads.</b> Although the Novasina water activity meter is suitable for construction of sorption isotherms, in the lower range of a w values (i. e. < 0. 45) the water uptake is slightly underestimated. ...|$|R
