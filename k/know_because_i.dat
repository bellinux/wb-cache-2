500|$|The downtempo {{song was}} {{developed}} {{on the following}} day, with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody. Named [...] "The Look of Love", the song contains the line [...] "No where to run, no place to hide. From the look of love, from the eyes of pride". Madonna {{was inspired by the}} look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is the way I want someone to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] After [...] "The Look of Love", Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer. The first was called [...] "Causing a Commotion", and was inspired by Penn and the couple's often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn {{was on the verge of}} breaking-up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life and the song: [...] "I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit him many times. I never would you <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> realize that it would just make things worse. [...] I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it." [...] The last song developed was [...] "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas. In addition to this, the album also included tracks by some acts on Warner Bros. Records, namely Club Nouveau, Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson. Commercially unsuccessful and unknown in the US, these groups needed a platform to project their songs, and including them in a Madonna album seemed like the right thing to do for Warner. Two tracks by Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi were included on the soundtrack at the request of Madonna since they were her friends. Despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album, Who's That Girl was marketed as a Madonna album, with only her face and name appearing on the cover art.|$|E

[...] He also declined appointment to the UK Privy Council and hence does not bear the title [...] "Right Honourable". His pride in his working class origins never left him. Once, while touring Fort Henry as prime minister, he asked the soldier accompanying him if he knew the thickness of the wall beside them. The embarrassed escort confessed that he didn't and Mackenzie replied, [...] "I do. It is five feet, ten inches. I <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> built it myself!" ...|$|E

[...] I <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have had my own struggles. [...] The stage and screen have been good to me.

2500|$|Dennett did {{not become}} active in the women's {{suffrage}} movement until her marriage began to break up. [...] Later, she wrote, [...] "I went into suffrage work, as perhaps you <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> needed an anaesthetic at the time, and suffrage was the nearest thing at hand that was unconnected with my previous work." [...] Dennett began her work as field secretary of the Massachusetts Suffrage Association, organizing lectures, rallies, sermons, cheap meals, speaking tours to gather signatures for petitions, and similar outreach efforts. [...] Dennett's opinion on why women deserved the vote was simple: [...] "Our basic principles that 'governments derive their just powers from {{the consent of the}} governed' [...] undeniably imply the right of women to direct representation by the vote, since women are governed and women are people." ...|$|E

[...] --- [...] "I happened to <b>know,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had seen it, {{that he had a}} Delta Psi Tea Company gold charm on his watch chain, but the reason he did not show it was one of delicacy; in 1908 they had not accepted his resignation but he kept the insigne hidden..." [...] --- [...] "He and Robert quickly looked at each other's watch-chain and the Delta Psi charm and smiled. [...] "You know, I've been meaning to write you a letter..." [...] ("Tea" [...] Company was a then-used appellation referring to the fraternity's Tau Cross emblem.) ...|$|E
60|$|This {{touched my}} heart a little, and brought tears {{out of my}} eyes, and I began to bless myself that such a prodigy of nature should happen upon my account; {{and this was the}} more strange to me, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> saw near it still, all along {{by the side of the}} rock, some other straggling stalks, which proved to be stalks of rice, and which <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had seen it grow in Africa when I was ashore there.|$|R

2500|$|In September 1991, the {{existence}} of the RAM Plan was leaked by Yugoslav Prime Minister Ante Marković and its details were published in the Belgrade weekly Vreme. He says [...] "the line has been clearly established [...] I <b>know</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> heard Milošević give the order to Karadžić to get in contact with General Uzelac and to order, following the decisions of the meeting of the military hierarchy, that arms should be distributed and that the TO of Krajina and Bosnia be armed and utilized in the realization of the RAM plan.". He accused the JNA of having [...] "placed itself directly in the service of one side" [...] and requested that Yugoslav Defense Minister Veljko Kadijević and Adžić resign, claiming the two were [...] "waging their own war in Croatia" [...] and that they had arranged a secret arms deal with conservative Soviet Union military leaders during their March 1991 visit to Moscow. Marković pressed Kadijević to comment on the RAM plan. The transcript of the tape leaked said: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{campaign}} {{then moved}} towards the January 19 South Carolina primary, the state which effectively ended McCain's 2000 campaign for President. Unlike 2000, McCain {{had the support}} of much of the state Republican establishment, both in terms of endorsements and campaign staff support. Nevertheless a bit of 2000 surfaced when a group of unknown size called [...] "Vietnam Veterans Against John McCain" [...] set up a website and began sending crude mailers to media members alleging that McCain passed military information to the North Vietnamese during his time as a POW. McCain set up a Truth Squad to combat such attacks and emphasized that he was supported by 75 former POWs. Orson Swindle, who was a POW with McCain, called the flier a [...] "vicious" [...] fraud. [...] "Nothing {{could be further from the}} truth," [...] Swindle said. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was there. The truth is, the North Vietnamese offered John McCain early release, and he refused." [...] After that, however, there was little in the way of dirty tricks during the rest of the campaign.|$|E
