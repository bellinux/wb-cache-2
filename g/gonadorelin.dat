50|$|Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) {{also known}} as gonadoliberin, and by various other names in its {{endogenous}} form and as <b>gonadorelin</b> (INN) in its pharmaceutical form, is a releasing hormone responsible {{for the release of}} follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary. GnRH is a tropic peptide hormone synthesized and released from GnRH neurons within the hypothalamus. The peptide belongs to gonadotropin-releasing hormone family.

Completion of the human genome project resulted in the identification of approximately 30,000 proteins encoded in the human genome and provided many more new target molecules for biomedical researchers to explore. To investigate the possibility of increasing the native potency of a given peptide or protein using a rational design approach, small and large amounts of peptides are needed, Some in the milligram scale. Once a desired activity or potency is identified, larger scale synthesis is need. For this, gram to multi-gram scale may be needed in order to initiate small animal studies. Often, after successful validation, an even larger scale of synthesis may be desired. These can range in scale from hundreds of grams to multi-kilo amounts.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} was to evaluate {{the influence of the}} timing of hormonal induction, using <b>gonadorelin</b> or common carp pituitary extract (CPE), on the reproductive activity of female Astyanax bimaculatus. Fish (N = 44) were weighed, measured, and acclimatized to experimental conditions with a photoperiod of 12 h: 12 h light:dark (L:D) for 10 days. Ovulation was induced with a single dose of CPE (6 mg/kg) or <b>gonadorelin</b> (80 μg/kg), given at 12 : 00 (halfway through the light phase (LP) or 24 : 00 (halfway through the dark phase (DP), in a 2 × 2 factorial design. The time of ovulation was calculated in degree hours and daily motor activity was recorded using a photocell. The fish were killed and the liver and gonads were weighed for calculation of gonadosomatic (GSI) and hepatosomatic (HSI) indexes, respectively. Absolute fecundity (AF), absolute fecundity relative to weight (AFRW) and length (AFRL), diameter of oocytes (mM), and percentage of oocytes with the germinal vesicle in a peripheral position (PPGV) were recorded. All females responded (ovulated). The female Astyanax bimaculatus had twilight motor activity rhythm. Females given CPE at 12 : 00 had a higher (P < 0. 05) percentage of oocytes with the germinal vesicle in a peripheral position compared with the group that received <b>gonadorelin</b> in the same period (95 ± 6 vs. 79 ± 21 %, mean ± SD).

40|$|The {{objective}} was to determine luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion and follicular dynamics in cattle following administration of 3 <b>gonadorelin</b> formulations that are commercially available in Canada. In experiment 1, nonlactating Holstein cows (n = 4 per group) {{were randomly assigned to}} receive 100 μg <b>gonadorelin</b> diacetate tetrahydrate, intramuscularly (C; Cystorelin, or FE; Fertagyl). Blood samples (for LH analysis) were collected 0, 1, 2, and 4 hours after treatment. In experiment 2, nonlactating Holstein cows (n = 10 per group) were randomly allocated to receive 100 μg <b>gonadorelin,</b> intramuscularly as follows: 2 mL of C; 1 mL of FE; or 2 mL of Factrel (FA, <b>gonadorelin</b> hydrochloride). <b>Gonadorelin</b> treatment was done on days 6 or 7 after ovulation and blood samples for LH analysis were collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after treatment. Ovaries were examined by ultrasonography, twice daily, to detect ovulation. A replicate was conducted using only C (n = 10) or FE (n = 10); blood samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours. In experiment 3, beef heifers (n = 10 per group) were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 GnRH <b>gonadorelin</b> treatments (as in the first phase of experiment 2) on days 6 or 7 after ovulation and blood samples were collected at 0, 0. 5, 1, 1. 5, 2, and 4 hours. In experiments 2 and 3, both mean and mean peak plasma LH concentrations were higher (P < 0. 05) in cattle treated with C. The proportion of dominant follicles that ovulated was higher (P < 0. 02) in Holstein cows treated with C than in those treated with FE or FA (18 / 19, 11 / 19, and 4 / 7, respectively), but {{there was no significant difference}} among the products in beef heifers (6 / 10, 6 / 10, and 4 / 10, respectively).

40|$|In {{the rabbit}} doe, {{ovulation}} {{does not occur}} spontaneously, {{but it has to}} be induced through a neurohormonal reflex, which is initiated during mating. So, when using AI, in the absence of a male, ovulation has to be induced by artificial methods. The ovulation inducing method most frequently used is an intramuscular injection of a synthetic analogue of GnRH or <b>gonadorelin.</b> An alternative way, demonstrated in previously studies, is the intravaginally administration of the hormone. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of GnRH analogue [des-Gly 10, D-Ala 6]–LHRH ethylamide, administered intravaginally, to induce ovulation in rabbit does submitted to AI. In this experiment, a large scale field trial was done to test the use of 25 µg of GnRH analogue [des-Gly 10, D-Ala 6]–LHRH ethylamide vehiculated in the seminal dose (n= 270) against 20 µg of <b>gonadorelin</b> via intramuscular (n= 270). Fertility was higher (P< 0. 05) when ovulation was induced by intravaginal administration of [des-Gly 10, D-Ala 6]–LHRH ethylamide (91. 1 % vs 85. 6 %). Prolificity or mortinatality were never affected by the ovulation induction treatments.

40|$|Wild Canis {{species such}} as the coyote (C. latrans) express a suite of {{reproductive}} traits unusual among mammals, including perennial pair-bonds and paternal care of the young. Coyotes also are monestrous, and both sexes are fertile only in winter; thus, they depend upon social and physiologic synchrony for successful reproduction. To investigate the mutability of seasonal reproduction in coyotes, we attempted to evoke an out-of-season estrus in October using one of two short-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agents: (1) a GnRH analogue, deslorelin (6 -D-tryptophan- 9 -(N-ethyl-L-prolinamide) - 10 -deglycinamide), 2. 1 mg pellet sc; or (2) <b>gonadorelin,</b> a GnRH (5 -oxoPro-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-GlyNH 2) porcine hypothalamic extract, 2. 0 mg/kg im once daily for 3 consecutive days. A transient increase in serum concentrations of estradiol and progesterone (1 and 2 wk, respectively) was detected after treatment with deslorelin but not <b>gonadorelin.</b> Also, socio-sexual behaviors reminiscent of winter mating (including courtship, mate-guarding, precoital mounts, and copulatory ties) were observed among the deslorelin group. During the subsequent breeding season (January and February), however, preovulatory courtship behavior and olfactory sampling appeared suppressed; emergence of mounts and copulations were delayed in both deslorelin and <b>gonadorelin</b> treatment groups. Furthermore, whereas 8 of 12 females treated in October ovulated and produced healthy litters in the spring, 4 naive coyotes failed to copulate or become pregnant. Thus, perturbation of hormones prior to ovulation in species with complex mating behaviors may disrupt critical intrapair relationships, even if fertility is not impaired physiologically...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Considering {{there are}} {{different}} and inconsistent results of the wider use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone or its analogs in cattle breeding and due to scarce research studies {{in the field of}} individual breeding, we decided to explore the influence of <b>gonadorelin</b> Fertagyl on the results of the blood serum progesterone levels and conception of cows in veterinary field practice. Examination of the progesterone levels involved 14 (fourteen) cows treated with <b>gonadorelin</b> (GnRH), Fertagyl, manufactured by Intervet, according to the manufacturer’s instructions dose of 2, 5 ml (250 micrograms), within five minutes after insemination. There are individual differences in progesteron concentrations according to days of sampling in treated cows, respectively individuality is manifested in all cows between days of blood sampling, except for period of luteolysis (18 th day) in non-gravid cows. Our research results indicate that there is a tendency for progesterone concentration to increase in gravid cows treated with Fertagyl at the time of insemination.

Up to 1. 0 mg/mL of stable liposomal mitoxantrone loading was achieved, with approximately 98 % of this being entrapped within the liposomes. In vitro cell culture studies revealed that the gonadorelin-modified liposomes bound to their target cells had significantly higher affinity and better antitumor efficiency than generic drug-loaded liposomes. These events were presumed to occur through specific interactions of the LHRH with its cognate receptors on the cell surface.

All animals were inseminated by AI with 2. 5 million live (4 million total) sex-sorted frozen thawed spermatozoa (X-chromosome bearing spermatozoa) within 18 to 21 hours after using of 2 nd GnRH. Vaginal electrical impedance (VEI), vulvar and perivulvar temperatures were recorded at different stages of synchronization protocol to asses oestrous. Pregnancy was confirmed by transrectal ultrasonography after 42 days of AI. The pregnancy rate was 37. 50...|$|E

Eight nuliparous cycling buffaloes received an intravaginal CIDR device containing 1. 9 g of progesterone and 100 mg of a GnRH analogue i. m. (<b>Gonadorelin,</b> Profertil) {{without regard to the}} stage of the estrous cycle (day of treatment, day 0) followed by 500 UI eCG (eCG, Novormon) 7 days later and 0. 150 mg of PGF 2 α i. m. (d-Cloprostenol, Prolise) 8 days later at the time of CIDR device removal. A second- treatment of the same GnRH analogue (100 mg, i. m.) was given 48 h after PGF 2 α. All buffaloes presented a BSC of 3, 5 (scale 1 to 5, 1 = very thin and 5 = fat) Follicular dynamics was monitored by transrectal ultrasound (Pie Medical, linear transducer of 7. 5 MHz). Only one female ovulated after first GnRH application. The diameter of the ovulatory follicle at the day of device removal was 7. 5 ± 1. 0 mm and at the day of second GnRH injection was 10. 5 ± 1. 2 mm.

40|$|The gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) {{stimulation}} test is {{a common}} procedure used to investigate normality of the pituitary-gonadal axis in mammals. There is very little information on the technique, its efficacy and side effects in small animals and in particular no information for male cats. In dogs, such test is performed by intravenous (IV) administration. With cats, {{the number of times}} the animal needs to be restrained for blood sampling should be the least possible. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess efficacy and side effects of the GnRH stimulation test in tomcats comparing the IV with the intramuscular (IM) route of administration. A GnRH stimulation test was performed in eight adult tomcats through IM or IV administration of 50  μg <b>gonadorelin.</b> The response of the pituitary-gonadal axis was assessed by measuring serum testosterone on blood samples collected prior to and 1  hr following treatment. When considering each single group of cats, the post-stimulation serum testosterone values were significantly higher than the pre-treatment ones (p < . 05). When comparing the two groups of cats, basal testosterone concentrations did not differ, and also post-GnRH testosterone concentrations did not differ. In conclusion, in the cats of our study, the GnRH stimulation test produced the same results following the IM or the IV route of administration. Therefore, in tomcats, the IM route can be considered as effective as the IV one and should be preferred when doing a GnRH test...|$|E

Liposomes were prepared by lipid film hydration and an ultrasound dispersion process. Thiolated <b>gonadorelin</b> with affinity for the LHRH receptor was chemically coupled to N-[(3 -maleimide- 1 -oxopropyl) aminopropyl polyethylene glycol-carbamyl] distearoyl-l-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine via a thioether bond and subsequently inserted into polyethylene glycol-grafted liposomes. The liposome was characterized {{in terms of its}} size, ligand density, drug loading, and leakage properties. The targeting nature and antitumor effects of the liposomes were evaluated in vitro using cultured MCF- 7 breast cancer cells. A protein assay of ligand coupling to the liposomal surface indicated that more than 60 % of the LHRH peptides were inserted into the liposome bilayer. Up to 1. 0 mg/mL of stable liposomal mitoxantrone loading was achieved, with approximately 98 % of this being entrapped within the liposomes. In vitro cell culture studies revealed that the gonadorelin-modified liposomes bound to their target cells had significantly higher affinity and better antitumor efficiency than generic drug-loaded liposomes. These events were presumed to occur through specific interactions of the LHRH with its cognate receptors on the cell surface. It was concluded that the targeting properties of the delivery system would potentially improve the therapeutic benefits of mitoxantrone, as compared with nontargeted liposomes.

40|$|Background: Delayed puberty {{can result}} either from {{constitutional}} delay {{of growth and}} puberty (CDP) or idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test has been generally accepted as a current method for diagnosing delayed puberty. The objective {{of this research was}} to assess the cut-off values and the efficacy of GnRH stimulation test in the diagnosis of delayed puberty in both males and females. Methods: A study of 91 IHH, 27 CDP patients, 6 prepubertal children, and 20 pubertal adults was undertaken. Blood samples were obtained at 0, 30, 60, and 120 min after GnRH administration and the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured. For each parameter, the sensitivities and specificities were estimated, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed. Results: The ROC curves indicated that a serum basal LH < 0. 6 IU/L or peak LH < 9. 74 IU/L resulted in moderate sensitivity (73. 8 % or 80. 0 %) and specificity (90. 9 % or 86. 4 %) in the diagnosis of HH in males. Serum basal LH < 0. 85 IU/L or basal FSH < 2. 43 IU/L resulted in moderate sensitivity (80. 0 % or 100. 0 %) and specificity (75. 0 % or 50. 0 %) in the diagnosis of HH in females. Conclusions: Our data suggest that isolated use of the <b>gonadorelin</b> stimulation test is almost sufficient to discriminate between HH and CDP in males, but unnecessary in females. The most useful predictor is serum basal or peak LH to differentiate these two disorders in males, but serum basal LH or FSH in females...|$|E
40|$|AbstractResponse to superovulatory, embryo {{yields and}} quality, were {{evaluated}} after increasing exposure time to exogenous progesterone during superstimulation, {{with or without}} the addition of a GnRH agonist. Thirty-four ewes from the Santa Inês breed were synchronized with an intravaginal progesterone device (CIDR). The animals were randomly divided into three groups: exposure to progesterone for 14 days (Control, n= 12); 12 h extension of progesterone exposure (12 hP 4 group, n= 11); and 12 h extension, associated with the administration of 25 μg of <b>gonadorelin</b> acetate (12 hP 4 GnRH group, n= 11). From the 12 th to the 15 th day of protocol, 133 mg of pFSH were administered through eight decreasing doses. Artificial inseminations were performed 36 and 48 h after device withdrawal, using frozen/thawed semen. The number of ewes on estrus and the time to onset of estrus after withdrawing device were similar among between all groups (P> 0. 05). All groups presented high superstimulatory response (averages ranging from 14. 33 to 16. 18 follicles ≥ 4 mm) (P> 0. 05). All groups also showed a large quantity of CL (averages ranging from 11 to 12) (P> 0. 05). The longer exposure to progesterone no reduced degenerated embryo proportion (Control= 30 %; 12 hP 4 = 7 % and 12 hP 4 GnRH= 10 %; P> 0. 05). The fertilization rate was significantly higher in 12 hP 4 GnRH when compared to Control and to 12 hP 4 (77 %, 34 % and 41 % respectively). These results suggest the association of longer progesterone exposure plus GnRH administration is an alternative to increase oocyte fertilization rates when fixed time insemination is used...|$|E

Two hundred heifers were divided into ten experimental treatment: control group with no injection 1) administration of 2. 5 mL <b>Gonadorelin</b> (a GnRH analogue) in day of insemination 2) administration of 5 mL GnRH in day of insemination 3) administration of 10 mL GnRH in day of AI insemination 4) administration of 2. 5 mL GnRH in day 5 post-insemination 5) administration of 5 mL GnRH in day 5 post-insemination 6) administration of 10 mL GnRH in day 5 post-insemination 7) administration of 2. 5 mL GnRH in day 12 post-insemination 8) administration of 5 mL GnRH in day 12 post-insemination 9) administration of 10 mL GnRH in day 12 post-insemination. Blood samples were collected in days 0, 5, 12 and 19 post insemination (AI = Day 0) for analysis of serum P 4 concentration. There {{was no significant difference}} among experimental groups on day of insemination. Evaluation of P 4 concentration on day 19 illustrated differences in progesterone concentration between groups on day 19 post-insemination.

40|$|The GnRH antagonist, acyline, has not {{yet been}} {{investigated}} in the stallion. Our study aimed to: (1) evaluate the downregulation of the stallion hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by acyline through assessment of seminal parameters, testicular volume, and sexual behavior; (2) assess hormonal response of acyline-treated stallions to GnRH stimulation; and (3) verify reversibility after treatment. Stallions were assessed pretreatment and subsequently treated (every five days) for 50 days: acyline (n = 4; 330 μg/kg acyline) or control (n = 4, vehicle). The stallions were then monitored for 62 days after the last day of treatment. Treatment-induced declines (P < 0. 05) in FSH, LH, testosterone, and estrone sulfate. Gonadotropins and testosterone returned to control values within 9 days, and estrone sulfate by 14 days, after discontinuation of treatment. Acyline-treated stallions failed to respond with a rise in FSH, LH, and testosterone after exogenous GnRH stimulation (<b>gonadorelin)</b> at Day 46 of treatment compared to pretreatment stimulation and control stallions. Decreases (P < 0. 05) were observed in total sperm numbers and motility (week 2) in acyline-treated stallions, as well as total seminal plasma protein (week 2) and testicular volume (week 5). Over the course of the study, the time to erection, time to ejaculation, and number of mounts increased (P < 0. 0001) across both groups of stallions; however, there was no effect of treatment or treatment by time interactions on these parameters. Testicular volume, and most seminal parameters regained normal levels within 62 days after treatment ended; on follow-up, sperm output of acyline-treated stallions was regained within 7 months after the end of experiment. In conclusion, acyline reversibly suppresses the stallion hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis...|$|E
40|$|Regulating {{the time}} of {{ovulation}} in the mare has many practical and beneficial management applications, including use with artificial insemination. The objective {{of the present study}} was to test the effectiveness of Cystorelin(TM) (<b>gonadorelin</b> diacetate tetrahydrate) to elicit increased LH secretion and to induce ovulation in cyclic mares. A total of 24 mares of Thoroughbred and stock type breeding was used in this study. Mares possessing an ovarian follicle 3. 5 cm to 4. 0 cm in diameter were assigned to either treatment with three 75 microg (1. 5 mL) i. m. injections of Cystorelin(TM) or three 1. 5 mL i. m. injections of sterile saline (control). Treatment with Cystorelin(TM) reduced (P 3 ̆c. 05) the mean number of days until ovulation (2. 25 +/- 0. 25 vs 3. 23 +/- 0. 41 for Cystorelin(TM) and saline, respectively), although variation in the time to ovulation was similar (P 3 ̆e. 81). Mean plasma LH levels were calculated over four time periods (- 30 to 0 (Period 1), 30 - 120 (Period 2), 150 - 240 (Period 3), 270 - 360 min (Period 4)). Luteinizing hormone response was analyzed by comparing the mean LH value of Period 1, 2, and 3 with the baseline mean. Although the level in Period 2 tended (P 3 ̆c. 07) to be higher than baseline, LH levels in Periods 3 and 4 were not different from baseline (P 3 ̆e. 15, P 3 ̆e. 18 respectively). In summary Cystorelin(TM) effectively hastened ovulation in mares. Further research is necessary to develop a protocol that can also reduce variability in {{the time of}} ovulation...|$|E
