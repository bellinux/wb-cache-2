40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In 2005, we {{presented}} {{for the first}} time overall estimates of annual costs for brain disorders (mental and neurologic disorders) in Europe. This new report presents updated, more accurate, and comprehensive 2010 estimates for 30 European countries. METHODS: One-year prevalence and annual cost per person of 19 major groups of disorders are based on 'best estimates' derived from systematic literature reviews by panels of experts in epidemiology and health economics. Our cost estimation model was populated with national statistics from Eurostat to adjust to 2010 values, converting all local currencies to Euros (euro), imputing cost for countries where no data were available, and aggregating country estimates to purchasing power parity-adjusted estimates of the total cost of brain disorders in Europe in 2010. RESULTS: Total European 2010 cost of brain disorders was euro 798 billion, of which direct health care cost 37 %, direct non-medical cost 23 %, and indirect cost 40 %. Average cost per inhabitant was euro 5. 550. The European average cost per person with a disorder of the brain ranged between euro 285 for headache and euro 30 000 for neuromuscular disorders. Total annual cost per disorder (<b>in</b> <b>billion</b> <b>euro</b> 2010) was as follows: addiction 65. 7; anxiety disorders 74. 4; brain tumor 5. 2; child/adolescent disorders 21. 3; dementia 105. 2; eating disorders 0. 8; epilepsy 13. 8; headache 43. 5; mental retardation 43. 3; mood disorders 113. 4; multiple sclerosis 14. 6; neuromuscular disorders 7. 7; Parkinson's disease 13. 9; personality disorders 27. 3; psychotic disorders 93. 9; sleep disorders 35. 4; somatoform disorder 21. 2; stroke 64. 1; and traumatic brain injury 33. 0. CONCLUSION: Our cost model revealed that brain disorders overall are much more costly than previously estimated constituting a major health economic challenge for Europe. Our estimate should be regarded as conservative because many disorders or cost items could not be included because of lack of data...|$|E

The former fixed price base (last 1995 prices) has been replaced by an annually changing price base (previous yearÂ´s prices) with chain linking. But the chain-linked levels <b>in</b> absolute terms (<b>billion</b> <b>Euro)</b> are not additive. The sum of chain-linked sub aggregates (e. g. real gross value added by industries) differs from the value of the chain-linked total aggregate (e. g. real GDP). Thus it is no longer possible to calculate time series of ratios based on deflated values. Economic analysis of structural change or of the inter-sector division of labor thus loses a useful complementary measurement tool. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} indirect costs associated with losses in productivity due to sickness absence among registered workers in Poland. Material and Methods: Data on sick leave durations in 2013 was obtained from the Social Insurance Institution (SII) (Zakład Ubezpieczeń Społecznych – ZUS). Based on the number of assumptions, this data was used for calculating absence durations. The costs of lost productivity were estimated on the basis of the measure of gross value added. Results: Estimated losses in productivity due to absenteeism in 2013 together accounted for 4. 33 % of gross domestic product (GDP) (17. 09 <b>billion</b> <b>euro).</b> <b>In</b> the female population, the total value of losses amounted to 9. 66 <b>billion</b> <b>euro,</b> but excluding the costs of pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium (2. 96 <b>billion</b> <b>euro),</b> it was 6. 7 <b>billion</b> <b>euro.</b> <b>In</b> the male population, the loss amounted to 7. 43 <b>billion</b> <b>euro.</b> The highest overall costs of sickness absence based on age were found in the age group of 30 – 39 years (5. 14 <b>billion</b> <b>euro,</b> including pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium – 1. 474 billion euro; respiratory diseases – 0. 632 <b>billion</b> <b>euro,</b> injuries and poisonings – 0. 62 <b>billion</b> <b>euro).</b> <b>In</b> the group of people aged > 40 years, the highest cost was generated by bone-muscular diseases (1. 553 <b>billion</b> <b>euro)</b> and injuries and poisoning (1. 251 <b>billion</b> <b>euro).</b> Higher losses <b>in</b> the productivity of women in addition to pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium were due to mental and behavioral disorders (0. 71 <b>billion</b> <b>euro),</b> diseases of the genitourinary system (0. 38 <b>billion</b> <b>euro),</b> and neoplasms (0. 35 <b>billion</b> <b>euro).</b> At the same time, in men, compared to women, we observed higher losses due to injuries and poisoning (1. 65 <b>billion</b> <b>euro),</b> and diseases of musculoskeletal (1. 26 <b>billion</b> <b>euro),</b> nervous (0. 79 <b>billion</b> <b>euro),</b> circulatory (0. 65 <b>billion</b> <b>euro),</b> and digestive (0. 41 <b>billion</b> <b>euro)</b> systems. Conclusions: Improvement and further development of effective strategies for prevention of complications of pregnancy and chronic diseases in the workplace are necessary.

5000|$|Attention and attentiveness {{have become}} a new {{commodity}} for which a market developed. [...] "The amount of attention that is absorbed {{by the media and}} redistributed in the competition for quotas and reach is not identical with the amount of attention, that is available in society. The total amount circulating in society is made up of the attention exchanged among the people themselves and the attention given to media information. Only the latter is homogenised by quantitative measuring and only the latter takes on the character of an anonymous currency." [...] According to Franck, any surface of presentation that can guarantee a certain degree of attentiveness works as magnet for attention, for example, media which are actually meant for information and entertainment, culture and the arts, public space etc. It is this attraction which is sold to the advertising business. In Germany, the advertising industry contributes 1.5% of the gross national income.
