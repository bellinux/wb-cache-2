5|$|Plan after plan is thwarted: Elaine tries bribing the maître d'hôtel, but is unsuccessful. They {{contemplate}} {{on getting}} food to go, but they can't eat Chinese {{food in a}} taxicab. Elaine is ravenous, but refuses to eat concession stand food at the movie theater. After missing Tatiana's call, George decides he's {{no longer in the}} mood for the film, Elaine wants to leave and get a hamburger, and Jerry decides that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> dinner with his uncle. As soon as they leave, the maître d' calls their party.|$|E
25|$|An {{area where}} African Americans in general {{outstrip}} whites {{is in their}} condemnation of homosexuality. Prominent leaders in the Black church have demonstrated against gay rights issues such as gay marriage. This stands {{in stark contrast to}} the down-low phenomenon of covert male–male sexual acts. There are those within the community who take a different position, notably the late Coretta Scott King and the Reverend Al Sharpton, the latter of whom, when asked in 2003 whether he supported gay marriage, replied that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> been asked if he supported black marriage or white marriage.|$|E

2500|$|After Love Never Dies {{opened on}} 9 March 2010 in London, it {{received}} mostly negative critical reviews. Perhaps {{the most positive}} review was Paul Taylor's in The Independent giving the show five stars, and writing, [...] "What is in no doubt is the technical excellence of Jack O'Brien's seamlessly fluent, sumptuous (and sometimes subtle) production, or the splendour of the orchestra which pours forth Lloyd Webber's dark-hued, yearning melodies as if its life depended on them. Special praise {{should go to the}} lyrical lavishness of Bob Crowley and Jon Driscoll's designs, with their gilt interiors where the vegetation-imitating contours and giant peacock-plumage of Art Nouveau run rampant, and their ghostly external locations where a brilliantly deployed combination of flowing projection (timed to perfection with emotional/ rhythmic shifts in the music) and solidly presented stage-effects create a dizzying Coney Island of the mind". In stark contrast, Ben Brantley of The New York Times gave it zero stars, calling the production [...] "a big, gaudy new show. And <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>have</b> a [...] "kick me" [...] sign pasted to his backside. ... This poor sap of a show feels as eager to be walloped as a clown in a carnival dunking booth. Why bother, when from beginning to end, Love Never Dies is its very own spoiler." ...|$|E
