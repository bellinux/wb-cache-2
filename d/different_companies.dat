5|$|Animation work on Animaniacs was farmed out {{to several}} {{different}} studios, both American and international, {{over the course}} of the show's production. The animation companies included Tokyo Movie Shinsha (now known as TMS Entertainment), StarToons, Wang Film Productions, Freelance Animators New Zealand, and AKOM, and most Animaniacs episodes frequently had animation from <b>different</b> <b>companies</b> in each episode's respective segments.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisation}} of the French 55th Infantry Division was chaotic. Most units {{had been}} involved in construction work and were constantly moved to different tactical positions. Of the nine companies in position by 10 May, only a few had been holding their respective positions for even a few days and were not familiar with them. One of the premier infantry regiments, the 213th Infantry Regiment, was removed from the line altogether and was replaced with the 331st Regiment. In some cases, Infantry regiments were made up of several <b>different</b> <b>companies</b> from several different battalions from different regiments. For example, the 295th Infantry Regiment's 6th Company, 2nd Battalion, was made up of four <b>different</b> <b>companies</b> which were drawn from three different battalions belonging to three different regiments.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1986, {{the game}} was ported to {{numerous}} platforms with <b>different</b> <b>companies</b> handling the conversions; several home versions were published by Electronic Arts, Tiger Electronics released handheld and tabletop LCD versions of the game, and it was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System by Rare. The Commodore 64 version had a secret extra level not present in other versions.|$|E
5|$|Blyton capitalised {{upon her}} {{commercial}} success {{as an author}} by negotiating agreements with jigsaw puzzle and games manufacturers from the late 1940s onwards; by the early 1960s some 146 <b>different</b> <b>companies</b> were involved in merchandising Noddy alone. In 1948 Bestime released four jigsaw puzzles featuring her characters, and the first Enid Blyton board game appeared, Journey Through Fairyland, created by BGL. The first card game, Faraway Tree, appeared from Pepys in 1950. In 1954 Bestime released the first four jigsaw puzzles of the Secret Seven, and the following year a Secret Seven card game appeared.|$|E

5|$|Bryan Singer, who had {{directed}} {{the two previous}} films, X-Men (2000) and X2, decided to leave to work on Superman Returns, as he had not even defined the storyline for a third film. Matthew Vaughn, who was initially hired as the new director, left due to personal and professional issues, and was replaced with Ratner. Filming took place from August 2005 to January 2006 with a budget of $210 million, and was consequently the most expensive film {{at the time of}} its release. It had extensive visual effects created by 11 <b>different</b> <b>companies.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of nationalisation, {{interchanges}} were provided between the lines previously belonging to the three <b>different</b> <b>companies</b> that built them (AATC, CHADOPyF and Lacroze) since previously only the CHADOPyF lines (C, D and E) had formal connections between them. However, the rate of expansion of the network during this period had slowed considerably and only one station was opened during the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Spectre {{was filmed}} from December 2014 to July 2015, with {{locations}} in Austria, the United Kingdom, Italy, Morocco and Mexico.

5|$|The ballet {{was staged}} by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in 1911 at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, with Tamara Karsavina and Nijinsky as Giselle and Albrecht. Anna Pavlova danced Giselle {{with her own}} company in 1913. Alicia Markova danced the role with the Vic-Wells Ballet in 1934, and Margot Fonteyn took the role in 1937 when Markova left the company. The English loved Giselle. In 1942, for example, three <b>different</b> <b>companies</b> were dancing the ballet in London.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the history}} of the Oslo Tramway and Metro, 15 <b>different</b> <b>companies</b> have owned, {{constructed}} or operated parts or all of the network. The first street trams in Oslo were built by three <b>different</b> <b>companies,</b> each with their own network. The private Kristiania Sporveisselskab started with a horsecar service in 1875, but electrified their lines after Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei started with electric trams in 1894. Between 1899 and 1905, the municipality operated street trams through Kristiania Kommunale Sporveie. Starting in 1898, the private Holmenkolbanen, and later the municipal Akersbanerne and private Ekebergbanen, built suburban light rail systems. In 1924, the city took over the street trams and established Oslo Sporveier. After the municipal merger between Aker and Oslo in 1948, the Municipality of Oslo became the major stock holder of Holmenkolbanen. Bærumsbanen was taken over by Oslo Sporveier in 1944, and in 1971 disestablished. The private light rail lines were gradually nationalized and transferred to Oslo Sporveier, which operated the entire network by 1975. The metro was established in 1966 and was operated by Oslo Sporveier, which also operated the city's buses and contracted the ferries.|$|E
5|$|A major {{influence}} in The Winter Soldier was conspiracy fiction from the 1970s such as Three Days of the Condor, with the script also drawing from the Winter Soldier story arc written by Ed Brubaker. The script {{was written in}} 2011, with the Russo brothers entering negotiations to direct in June 2012 and casting beginning the following month. Principal photography commenced in April 2013 in Los Angeles, California before moving to Washington, D.C. and Cleveland, Ohio. While the directors aimed for more realism, with focus on practical effects and intense stunt work, 2,500 visual effects shots were done by six <b>different</b> <b>companies.</b>|$|E

5|$|After leaving Sag Harbor, NY114 {{encounters}} a modern roundabout {{at the intersection}} of Short Beach Road (County Route60 or CR60) and Tyndall Road. NY114 makes a turn through the roundabout and then travels one more mile through North Haven before reaching the first of two ferries along its route. Shelter Island's two ferries, both of which technically carry NY114, are operated by two <b>different</b> <b>companies.</b> The South Ferry (between North Haven and Shelter Island) is operated by the South Ferry Company and the North Ferry (between Shelter Island Heights and Greenport) is operated by the North Ferry Company. Since the two entities are separate, there is no incentive to use both ferries, although both companies offer discounts for round trip fares and for Shelter Island residents.|$|E
5|$|Although {{in places}} {{there was a}} mixture of <b>different</b> <b>companies</b> and platoons dug in together, the Australians were {{deployed}} with the 8th Battalion in the south still centred on Bolton's Ridge. North of them, covering the southern sector of 400 Plateau, were the mixed together 6th and 7th Battalions, both now commanded by Colonel Walter McNicoll of the 6th. North of them was the 5th Battalion, and the 10th Battalion covered the northern sector of 400 Plateau at Johnston's Jolly. But by now they were battalions in name only, having all taken heavy casualties; the commanders had little accurate knowledge of where their men were located.|$|E
5|$|Glee {{debuted in}} America on the Fox network on May19, 2009. Series creator Ryan Murphy planned to include {{five to eight}} musical numbers per episode, and to release {{accompanying}} soundtrack albums every few months. In the week prior to the broadcast of the pilot episode, Murphy stated that seven <b>different</b> <b>companies</b> had bid on {{the rights to the}} series' first soundtrack. The contenders were narrowed down to four labels, with Fox ultimately signing a deal with Columbia Records as a result of chairman Rob Stringer's belief that Glee would be a success. Stringer appreciated the series' use of both classic and contemporary pop music. He suggested that other record labels underestimated the potential of Glee musical releases as they are all cover versions.|$|E

5|$|In 1856, {{the church}} inaugurated {{a system of}} {{handcart}} companies in order to enable poor European emigrants to make the trek more cheaply. Handcarts, two-wheeled carts that were pulled by emigrants instead of draft animals, were sometimes used as an alternate means of transportation from 1856 to 1860. They were seen as a faster, easier, and cheaper way to bring European converts to Salt Lake City. Almost 3,000 Mormons, with 653 carts and 50 supply wagons, traveling in 10 <b>different</b> <b>companies,</b> made the trip over the trail to Salt Lake City. While {{not the first to}} use handcarts, they were the only group to use them extensively.|$|E
5|$|More than 1,000 {{shots of}} Wolverine have visual effects in them, which {{required}} three effects supervisors and seventeen <b>different</b> <b>companies</b> {{to work on}} the film. The most prominent was Hydraulx, who had also worked in the X-Men trilogy and was responsible for the battle in Three Mile Island and Gambit's powers. Many elements were totally generated through computer-generated imagery, such as the adamantium injection machine, the scene with Gambit's plane and Wolverine tearing through a door with his newly enhanced claws. CG bone claws were also created for some scenes because the props did not look good in close-ups. Extensive usage of matte paintings was also made, with Matte World Digital creating five different mattes for the final scene of the film—a pullback depicting the destroyed Three Mile Island—and Gavin Hood handing company Hatch Productions pictures of favelas as reference for the Africa scenes.|$|E
5|$|On the eastern-most beach, Fox Green, {{elements}} of five <b>different</b> <b>companies</b> had become entangled, {{and the situation}} was little improved by the equally disorganized landings of the second wave. Two more companies of the 3rd Battalion joined the melee, and, having drifted east in the first wave, I/16 finally made their traumatic landing on Fox Green, at 08:00. Two of their six boats were swamped on their detour to the east, and as they came in under fire, {{three of the four}} remaining boats were damaged by artillery or mines, and the fourth was hung up on an obstacle. A captain from this company found himself senior officer, and in charge of the badly out of shape 3rd Battalion.|$|E
