40|$|Masters Research - Master of Clinical PsychologyAim: <b>Humanitarian</b> aid <b>personnel</b> are {{increasingly}} {{at risk of}} being exposed to primary and vicarious trauma due to the inherent risks associated with humanitarian work and the increasing politicization of humanitarian aid (Curtis, 2009; McCormack, Joseph, & Hagger, 2009; McFarlane, 2004). There is a need for the humanitarian field to develop an academic discipline that focuses on producing scientifically valid theories and procedures in the selection, training, and postmission support of aid personnel (McCall & Salama, 1999; Musa & Hamid, 2008). Furthermore, {{there is a need for}} a sensitive instrument for determining personnel’s vulnerability to traumatic stress. The PostAID-Q is an 18 -item self-report questionnaire designed to measure Altruistic Identity Disruption (AID). AID is a type of psychosocial distress that leads to feelings of isolation and invalidation, which results in reintegration difficulties and increased risk of psychological morbidity. The aim of this study was to establish the psychometric properties of the Postmission Altruistic Identity Disruption Questionnaire (PostAID-Q), in particular, the construct validity, incremental validity, and internal consistency reliability. Method: Participants were recruited from the DEVEX (www. devex. com) and by word of mouth from the researchers humanitarian aid contacts. A total of 60 participants completed an online survey of 99 questions, comprising six questionnaires: the PostAID-Q, the 12 -item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12), the Revised Impact of Event Scale (IES-R), the Short Depression Happiness Scale (SDHS), the Changes in Outlook Questionnaire (CIOQ), and the Social Provisions Scale (SPS). To determine construct validity, scores on the PostAID-Q were compared to scores on the 12 -item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12), the Revised Impact of Event Scale (IES-R), the Social Provisions Scale (SPS), the short-form Changes in Outlook Questionnaire (CIOQ), and the Short Depression Happiness Scale (SDHS) using bivariate correlations. Incremental Validity was examined using two hierarchical regression analyses. The dependent variable for the first regression was the IES-R and the independent variables were the GHQ- 12 for the first step and the PostAID-Q for the second step. In the second hierarchical regression the dependent variable was the SPS. The independent variables were the same as the first regression. Internal Consistency Reliability was determined by examining the Cronbach’s alpha of the PostAID-Q. Results: The current research replicated previous internal consistency findings for the GHQ- 12, IES-R, SPS, and SDHS. The PostAID-Q demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity and thus construct validity. It also provided incremental validity compared to the GHQ- 12 and strong internal consistency reliability (α =. 82). The intrusion factor of the IES-R and the social integration factor of the SPS each uniquely measured 17 % of PostAID/Q variance. This means that 34 % of PostAID/Q variance is accounted for by intrusion and difficulties with social integration. Conclusion: The PostAID-Q promises to be a useful self-report measure in the postmission care of <b>humanitarian</b> aid <b>personnel</b> and postmission/pre-deployment processes of humanitarian aid organizations. It is able to measure psychosocial distress in <b>humanitarian</b> aid <b>personnel</b> during reintegration. Further research should focus on replicating the validity results and establishing the reliability of the PostAID-Q. Because the PostAID/Q can measure intrusive thoughts and social integration problems in international workers, future research should also determine the validity of its use with military personnel...|$|R

40|$|Increasingly, <b>humanitarian</b> aid <b>personnel</b> {{are exposed}} to both vicarious and primary {{traumatic}} events. The Postmission Altruistic Identity Disruption Questionnaire (PostAID/Q) was developed {{with the aim of}} guiding humanitarian organizations in the psychosocial aftercare of personnel particularly their reintegration within families, the workplace, and society postmission. Altruistic identity disruption refers to reintegration difficulties experienced by returnees from humanitarian work such that the person feels alienated, invalidated, isolated from others who do not share his or her experiences, and questioning of their role as an aid worker. The PostAID/Q is an 18 -item self-report measure designed to assess altruistic identity disruption. Sixty-one aid personnel completed an initial pool of 79 items developed by the authors from semistructured interviews with aid personnel. Following inspection of item frequencies, 36 items were retained. Following principal components analysis with a forced one-component solution, 18 items were selected to compose the PostAID/Q. The PostAID/Q promises to be useful to both aid organizations and the individual aid worker in the reintegration period postmission by (a) guiding organizations in their psychosocial support of aid personnel; (b) assisting personnel in identifying interpersonal, environmental, and perceived organizational influences on their psychosocial well-being; and (c) indicating returnees’ subsequent readiness for redeployment...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a paucity}} of {{research}} into the subjective experiences of <b>humanitarian</b> aid <b>personnel</b> exposed to modern global conflicts and disasters {{in the course of}} their work. In particular, little is known about how they make sense of any dual threat: (1) witnessing catastrophic and traumatic events perpetrated on those they seek to serve and (2) experiencing personal threat to self. This phenomenological study explores the idiographic interpretation of aid personnel working in complex humanitarian settings including exposure to genocide, and the impact of such exposure on reintegration processes postmission. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, and data were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). One theme: Complex humanitarian distress and growth overarched five subordinate themes. Four of the subordinate themes highlighted long term psychological distress including shame, moral doubt, betrayal, and narcissistic coping. The fifth theme, Reparation with 'self', describes a redefining of self-worth and altruistic identity over time despite earlier perceived moral failure and sense of rejection from organization and important others. Reparation with self, as a positive outcome from traumatic distress and lack of validating support from important others, is discussed in light of current posttraumatic growth literature. Implications for therapists and recruiting organizations are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Somalia {{has been}} one of the UN member {{countries}} who lingers from the presence of terrorist groups in its territory, that exert tremendous influence in the daily life of its society and economy. Al Shabaab is well known in the horn of Africa, particularly in Somalia, for its terrorist training and strong affiliation with other terrorist groups in Nigeria and Al-Qaeda. The Harakat Shabaab Al Mujahidin, also known as Al-Shabaab. has completely controlled the central and southern part of Somalia including some of its important sea ports, which are vital for the country’s economy. Although Ethiopian and Somali military forces attempted to rout the group in a two week war between December 2006 and January 2007, Al Shabaab, with its 14, 500 militants, still continues to maintain control over strategic locations, not only in Somalia, but also throughout the horn of Africa.

40|$|Naval Postgraduate School Technical Report, NPS-OR- 11 - 007, January 2012 Humanitarian {{assistance}} is of growing {{importance to the}} United States and the Department of Defense's strategic objectives. Thus, United States combatant commands increasingly rely on humanitarian assistance cargo transportation programs to deliver materiel to people in need in their areas of responsibility. This report analyzes the options available to these commands in seeking humanitarian assistance cargo transportation. The report offers a description of current operations, with a specific focus on the European area of responsibility, where these programs have had limited activity. The analysis reaches the following conclusions: (1) currently no transportation program exists that focuses on providing a quality of service to combatant commands and humanitarian assistance transportation needs, (2) legal, fiscal, and operational mechanisms exist and are outlined to create such a program, and (3) exclusively space-available transportation is generally insufficient for providing the quality of service that may be required for relationship-building through humanitarian assistance cargo transportation, and contract shipping may be necessary. These conclusions are placed {{in the context of}} current humanitarian assistance operations, and relevant operational considerations are highlighted throughout the report. The analysis is based on both a quantitative model of transportation, as well as detailed conversations with <b>humanitarian</b> assistance <b>personnel</b> throughout key Department of Defense organizations...|$|R
