5|$|The {{western end}} of the area (around Nempnett Thrubwell) {{consists}} of the Harptree Beds which incorporate silicified clay, shale and Lias Limestone. Clifton Down Limestone, which includes Calcite and Dolomitic mudstones of the Carboniferous period, {{is found in the}} adjoining central band and Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. There are two main soil types, both generally well-drained. The mudstones around the lakes give rise to fertile silty clay soils that are a dull dusky red colour because of their <b>high</b> <b>iron</b> content. The clay content means that where unimproved they easily become waterlogged when wet, and hard with cracks and fissures during dry periods. The main geological outcrops around the lake are Mudstone, largely consisting of red Siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of Sandstone of the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside the course of the River Chew. The transition between the gently sloping landscape of the Upper Chew and Yeo Valleys and the open landscape of the Mendip Hills plateau is a scarp slope of 75 to 235 metres (250–770ft). The predominant formation is Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period. It formed as a result of desert erosion and weathering of the scarp slopes. It takes the form of rock fragments mainly derived from older Carboniferous Limestone cemented together by lime and sand which hardened to give the appearance of concrete. The northern boundary is formed by the sides of the Dundry Plateau where the most significant geological formation is the Inferior Oolite of the Jurassic period found on the higher ground around Maes Knoll. This overlays the Lower Lias Clay found on the adjoining slopes. The clays make a poor foundation and landslips are characteristic on the slopes. This area was once connected to the Cotswolds. The intervening land has subsequently been eroded leaving this outlier with the characteristics of the Cotswold Plateau. The unusual geological features have been recognised as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for their geological interest including Barns Batch Spinney, Hartcliff Rocks Quarry and Dundry Main Road South Quarry.|$|E
40|$|Biofortification {{of wheat}} for <b>higher</b> grain <b>iron</b> and zinc {{is the most}} {{feasible}} and cost-effective approach for alleviating micronutrient deficiency. The non-progenitor donor Aegilops species had 2 – 3 times <b>higher</b> grain <b>iron</b> and zinc content than the wheat cultivars, whereas the wheat–Aegilops substitution lines mostly of group 2 and 7 chromosomes had intermediate levels of grain micronutrients. The non-progenitor Aegilops species also had the <b>highest</b> <b>iron</b> content and intermediate-to-highest zinc content in straw, lower leaves, and flag leaves at the pre-anthesis, grain-filling, and maturity growth stages. The micronutrients accumulation status is followed by wheat–Aegilops substitution lines and is the least in wheat cultivars indicating that the donor Aegilops species and their substituted chromosomes possess genes for <b>higher</b> <b>iron</b> and zinc uptake and mobilization. The grain iron content was highly positively correlated with iron content in the plant tissues. Most of the lines had much <b>higher</b> <b>iron</b> and zinc content in all tissues during grain-filling period indicating <b>higher</b> <b>iron</b> and zinc uptake from soil during this stage. Although iron and zinc contents are nearly similar in grains, there was much less zinc content in the plant tissues of all the lines suggesting that the Triticeae species take up less zinc which is mobilized to grains more effectively than iron...|$|R

25|$|The {{first step}} taken before the {{bloomery}} {{can be used}} is {{the preparation of the}} charcoal and the iron ore. The charcoal is produced by heating wood to produce the nearly pure carbon fuel needed for the refining process. The ore is broken into small pieces and roasted in a fire to remove any moisture in the ore. Any large impurities in the ore can be crushed and removed. Since slag from previous blooms may have a <b>high</b> <b>iron</b> content, slag from previous blooms can be broken up and recycled into the bloomery with the new ore.|$|E

25|$|High {{specific}} gravity is a diagnostic property of a mineral. A variation in chemistry (and consequently, mineral class) correlates {{to a change}} in {{specific gravity}}. Among more common minerals, oxides and sulfides tend to have a higher specific gravity as they include elements with higher atomic mass. A generalization is that minerals with metallic or adamantine lustre tend to have higher specific gravities than those having a non-metallic to dull lustre. For example, hematite, Fe2O3, has a specific gravity of 5.26 while galena, PbS, has a specific gravity of 7.2–7.6, which is a result of their <b>high</b> <b>iron</b> and lead content, respectively. A very high specific gravity becomes very pronounced in native metals; kamacite, an iron-nickel alloy common in iron meteorites has a specific gravity of 7.9, and gold has an observed specific gravity between 15 and 19.3.|$|E
25|$|Pomerol lies {{immediately}} {{to the east and}} north-east of Libourne. Unlike most of the most prestigious communes of Bordeaux, it has no direct river access, being separated from the Dordogne to the south by the town and by Saint-Émilion, which lies to the south-east. To the north-east, across a stream called la Barbanne Rau lies Lalande-de-Pomerol. It stands on a gravel bank (a feature it shares with the prestigious appellations of the Médoc); towards the south and west, the soil is more sandy, while towards the north and east, it tends to clay. The sub-soil is dark packed clay, with a <b>high</b> <b>iron</b> content. The terrain is relatively flat with slight undulating slopes that fall from a height of 35-40 meters (115–130 feet) above sea level over a course of 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) to around 10 meters (33 feet).|$|E
25|$|The poor {{indicated}} they were not so much concerned about the tariff charged by the private water companies, since it was {{much lower than the}} prices they had to pay to private vendors. They were much more concerned about the high connection fees to the network that were unaffordable for most of them. While wealthier residents use suction pumps and storage tanks to improve supply, poorer residents suffer more from low pressure and intermittent supply. Water vendors are not effectively regulated in terms of service quality and prices charged. Obtaining water from private wells or hydrants involves queuing of up to two hours and costs of 15,000 Rupiahs (US$1.66) per month and family. Bottled water was also frequently bought at a cost of up to 85,000 Rupiahs (US$9.44) per month and family. Water from wells is often polluted with bacteria and salty, with salt levels increasing in the Northern parts of the city closer to the coast. Groundwater in some areas has <b>high</b> <b>iron</b> content and needs to be filtered. According to the Jakarta Environmental Management Body 90 percent of groundwater was contaminated by metal, nitrate and e-coli in 2011. Boiling of water is frequent. Water from the public network, including at public hydrants, is sometimes only available for several hours per day and not always of good quality.|$|E

500|$|Restoration {{continued}} with {{work on the}} church's slate roof and sandstone perimeter fence. The Spanish slates, installed in the 1970s, proved not to be durable in Sydney's climate due to their <b>high</b> <b>iron</b> content and their poor fixing had resulted in further damage. The solution to the deterioration was to replace the slates using Welsh slates. The roof project was completed after a fund-raising effort supported by the National Trust of Australia. In 2013, the interior was repainted after preparation that involved [...] "colour testing and selection, memorial protection and ceiling acoustic repairs". As a heritage-listed building, the church has a program of continual conservation. Its custodians remain [...] "ever mindful" [...] of their responsibility to the wider public {{as well as to}} the congregation.|$|E
500|$|When {{the street}} was built, each end {{featured}} a cottage with <b>high</b> <b>iron</b> gates which limited traffic to residents and their visitors. The footpaths were less restricted, but featured [...] "three or four posts between which a corpulent person had difficulty in squeezing." [...] These gates and posts have since been removed. The Crescent comprised a terrace of houses along the street's eastern side; {{the other side was}} not built on and was eventually converted into parkland. In 1822, a Catholic chapel, known as St George's Chapel was built at the southern-end of the terrace, the first Catholic church built in Taunton since the Reformation. The Catholic congregation moved out to a larger church in 1878 and the chapel was bought by the Freemasons, who converted it into a Masonic Lodge.|$|E
500|$|In the 18th century {{selective}} breeding of white common ducks {{led to a}} white domestic duck, generally known as the English White. Since at least the 1690s ducks had been farmed in Aylesbury, and raising English Whites became popular in Aylesbury and the surrounding villages. By 1813 it was remarked that [...] "ducks form a material article at market from Aylesbury and places adjacent: they are white, and as it seems of an early breed: they are bred and brought up by poor people, and sent to London by the weekly carriers". The duck farmers of Aylesbury {{went to great lengths}} to ensure the ducks retained their white colouring, keeping them clear of dirty water, soil with a <b>high</b> <b>iron</b> content and bright sunlight, all of which could discolour the ducks' feathers. Over time, {{selective breeding}} of the English White for size and colour gradually led to the development of the Aylesbury duck.|$|E
