5|$|The {{hurricane}} season officially began on June15, 1962. The National Hurricane Center began operations with no new equipment, and the warning agency instead opted to improve with the <b>existing</b> <b>equipment.</b> The agency {{had access to}} a system of radars that extended from Brownsville, Texas, to Eastport, Maine, which was set up in 1961. Although satellite imagery technology was available, the system was not fully active to provide daily images of Atlantic hurricanes. The season officially ended on November15.|$|E
5|$|For {{slow motion}} scenes like with bullets and drops of water, twin Phantom {{high-speed}} cameras were used which filmed 200 frames per second. A fight scene with Wesker and Chris in the Resident Evil 5 game was recreated shot-by-shot {{for the film}} and the Phantom cameras were used to create Wesker's superhuman speed which took about two days to film. The added size and weight of the 3D cameras meant the filmmakers {{were not able to}} use <b>existing</b> <b>equipment</b> such as Steadicam rigs. Instead the camera operator worked on a Segway to achieve the look of a Steadicam shot. Much of the action scenes were shot in front of a green screen. A 1983 Yak-52 was used throughout the film by Jovovich and Larter. Stunt pilot Martin Mattes was dressed like Jovovich and flew the plane for the camera.|$|E

The Hook and Ladder Company waived fees and dues for those enlisted from 1941 onward.

Also during the war, in 1944, the department received a trailer-type pump unit with a 500-gallon pump, hose, nozzle, ladders, and other tools. It was loaned to the village by the Office of Civil Defense and was an auxiliary to the <b>existing</b> <b>equipment.</b> One year later, Briarcliff High School graduate and Briarcliff Fire Company lieutenant Sgt.

25|$|At {{the start}} of a patrol mission all four engines would {{normally}} be running, but, as the aircraft's weight was reduced by the consumption of onboard fuel, up to two engines could be intentionally shut down, allowing the remaining engines to be operated in a more efficient manner. Instead of relying on ram air to restart an inactive engine, compressor air could be crossfed from a live engine to a starter turbine; the crossfeed duct was later discovered to be a potential fire hazard. Similarly, the two hydraulic systems on board were designed to be powered by the two inner engines that would always be running. Electrical generation was designed to far exceed the consumption of <b>existing</b> <b>equipment</b> to accommodate additional systems installed over the Nimrod's operational service.|$|E

The ordinance also authorized the digging of a well in the public square, and the department soon acquired a horse-drawn ladder truck for $1,600. The foreman of the Hook & Ladder Company requested the city council provide additional equipment in January 1894. Items requested included lanterns, a heavy iron hook, and axes with hooks on the pole, which was {{to add to the}} <b>existing</b> <b>equipment</b> that included the ladder truck and several hose carts. The city purchased a hand engine from Albany, Oregon, in 1890 for $400. In 1894, the Hillsboro Coffee Club organized to support what was then a volunteer fire department.|$|E

The fleet is led by three Koni class frigates which have been updated with more modern systems. These are due to be augmented in the coming years by a pair of MEKO A-200 frigates which will represent the most modern equipment of the navy when they enter service, also, Algeria signed a contract with China Shipbuilding Trading Company for the construction of three light frigates about 2,800 tons full load. A mixture of six corvettes and off-shore patrol vessels complement the frigates, while a large number of smaller boats cover the role of coastal patrol. Algeria had maintained a relatively large fleet of Osa class fast attack craft {{by the end of the}} Cold War, but it is questionable whether any of these remain in operational use.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCrude oil {{atmospheric}} distillation systems are an energy intensive processes; it was evaluated {{that the energy}} requirement for such plants is equivalent to a 2 % of the total crude oil processed [1]. An existing crude oil atmospheric unit is very expensive to modify due its complex configuration and interactions, and existing constraints of structure, limited space area, matches, bottlenecked equipments, etc. Thus, a few new crude distillation units are built and projects for revamping <b>existing</b> <b>equipments</b> are rather common. Revamping an existing plant is a difficult task, more complex than a new process design; many parameters must be considered and sometimes {{it is not possible}} to quantify all of them. This paper presents a new methodology based on rigorous simulation and optimisation framework that addresses both the distillation column and the heat exchanger network simultaneously to maximise the use of <b>existing</b> <b>equipments.</b> The methodology considers process changes and structural modifications together with the interactions between the existing distillation process and heat recovery system. The new method includes multiple objective functions such as energy savings, emissions reduction, capacity enhancement, and profit improvement. An actual atmospheric plant for MIDOR, an Egyptian refinery, has been considered for applications of the new optimisation methodology. Several retrofit solutions have been obtained, ranging from zero-modifications and simple additional exchanger areas to additional units or equipments...|$|R
