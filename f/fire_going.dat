5|$|The {{electric}} {{fire engine}} would have several advantages over the steam fire engine. One {{was that an}} electric fire engine could be brought eto full power immediately, whereas a steam fire engine took time. It was necessary to keep the <b>fire</b> <b>going</b> {{all the time to}} boil the water on a steam pump vehicle, with workmen furnishing coal for it. This was required so that as little time as possible was lost getting the water to boil to produce steam to run the water pump to extinguish the fire. In the case of an electric motor running a fire engine water pump, its operation was basically instantaneous since the motor was running at full power capacity when the switch was turned on. The advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall, (i.e. no coal or extensive maintenance) and simplicity of operation.|$|E
500|$|The Sunroom of the hotel, {{containing}} Californian craftsman furniture, provides {{vistas of}} the Pacific Ocean. A room, {{known as the}} Crystal Room, was allocated for small private dinner parties. [...] The principal dining room could accommodate up to 500 people. The Children's dining room, [...] which became the El Jardin Restaurant, is now the iconic Polo Lounge. The Polo Lounge {{was seen as the}} premier power dining spot in all of Los Angeles. The lounge was renovated in 1974, and given a softer design with table lamps and flowers. It is fashioned in peachy pink with dark green booths, each featuring a plug-in phone. [...] The photograph behind the bar depicts Will Rogers and Darryl F. Zanuck, two lounge regulars, playing polo. [...] The menu offers a classic Neil McCarthy salad, named after the polo-playing millionaire. The hotel has its own bakery and herb garden, makes its own vinegar and smokes meats. The chef in 2003 was Katsuo Sugiura, who cooked [...] "oak-grilled food with an Asian flair". [...] In 2007, one large suite was converted into the Bar Nineteen12. The fireplace in the hotel's lobby has a <b>fire</b> <b>going</b> every day of the year.|$|E
2500|$|In time, {{with the}} {{development}} of Buddhist doctrine, other interpretations were given, such as being an unconditioned state, a <b>fire</b> <b>going</b> out for lack of fuel, abandoning weaving (vana) together of life after life, and the elimination of desire. However, Buddhist texts have asserted since ancient times that nirvana is more than [...] "destruction of desire", it is [...] "the object of the knowledge" [...] of the Buddhist path.|$|E

50|$|Walter M. Cross {{invented a}} hot-air furnace system with three main elements: (1) a motor driven stoker for feeding {{fuel to the}} {{combustion}} chamber of a furnace, (2) a room thermostatic switch for controlling the feeding of fuel, and (3) a combustion stoker switch to prevent the <b>fire's</b> <b>going</b> out in warm weather not requiring domestic heating. The room thermostat the supply of heat, or discontinues its supply, by closing or opening the circuit to the stoker motor at the required temperatures. The combustion stoker switch, or holdfire control, responds to a low temperature in the furnace by causing the stoker to feed fuel so as to prevent the furnace <b>fire</b> from <b>going</b> out. The control of the combustion stoker switch is effective in mild weather when the room thermostat may not call for heat for a considerable period.|$|R
