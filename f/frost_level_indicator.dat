40|$|A proper methodological {{approach}} of investigating Holocene sea level changes {{is a prerequisite}} in order that the sea-level index points can be useful and significant. This requires the correct identification of the indicative meaning. The indicative meaning of the sea <b>level</b> <b>indicator</b> {{is defined as the}} altitudinal relationship of the local environment in which it accumulated to the contemporaneous reference tide level. This study identifies the index points using the litho-, bio-, and chrono-stratigraphic approach. The sea <b>level</b> <b>indicator</b> is derived from the regressive contact of the intercalated peat and marine clastic sequence, while the indicative meaning is estimated based upon the relationship with the contemporary samples. The study was carried out at two contrasting coastal locations, the fossil sites from Meru and Mardi in Kelang in the west and Penur (north and south transects) in Kuantan in the east, while the contemporary sites are from various ecological environments from both areas. Microfossil analysis of pollen and diatoms indicates that the former are more applicable, and defined the changing microfossil assemblages within the regressive contact of the sea <b>level</b> <b>indicator</b> samples. Seven sea level index points are identified. The finding agrees to the general assumptions of high mid-Holocene sea level history in peninsular Malaysia. A relative sea level difference between the west and east coast is indicated, but the significance, if any, is dealt with caution. The explanations of presumed differential crustal movement or sheer age/altitude variability of the index points are suggested...|$|R

40|$|The Last Interglacial (LIG) stage, with polar {{temperatures}} likely 3 - 5 C {{warmer than}} today, {{serves as a}} partial analogue for low-end future warming scenarios. Based upon a small set of local sea <b>level</b> <b>indicators,</b> the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) inferred that LIG global sea level (GSL) was about 4 - 6 m higher than today. However, because local sea levels differ from GSL, accurately reconstructing past GSL requires an integrated analysis of globally distributed data sets. Here we compile an extensive database of sea <b>level</b> <b>indicators</b> and apply a novel statistical approach that couples Gaussian process regression of sea level to Markov Chain Monte Carlo modeling of geochronological errors.

40|$|Abstract: Some of most used {{indicators}} {{in marine}} ecology are nucleic acid-derived indices. They {{can be divided}} by target levels in three groups: 1) at the organism <b>level</b> as ecophysiologic <b>indicators,</b> indicators such as RNA:DNA ratios, DNA:dry weight and RNA:protein, 2) at the population <b>level,</b> <b>indicators</b> such as growth rate, starvation incidence or fisheries impact indicators, and 3) at the community <b>level,</b> <b>indicators</b> such as trophic interactions, exergy indices and prey identification. The nucleic acids derived indices, especially RNA:DNA ratio, have been applied with success as indicators of nutritional condition, well been and growth in marine organisms. They are also useful as indicators of natural or anthropogenic impacts in marine population and communities, such as upwelling or dredge fisheries, respectively. They can help in understanding important issues of marine ecology such as trophic interactions in marine environment, fish and invertebrate recruitment failure and biodiversity changes, without laborious work of counting, measuring and identification of small marine organisms. Besides the objective of integrate nucleic acid derived indices across levels of organization, the paper will also include a general characterization of most used nucleic acid derived indices in marin...|$|R
40|$|The Last Interglacial (LIG) stage (ca. 130 115 ka), with polar {{temperatures}} likely 3 5 ◦ C {{warmer than}} today, {{serves as a}} partial analogue for low-end future warming scenarios. Multiple indicators suggest that LIG global sea level (GSL) was higher than at present; based upon a small set of local sea <b>level</b> <b>indicators,</b> the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 's Fourth Assessment Report inferred an elevation of approximately 4 6 m. While this estimate may be correct, it is based upon overly simplistic assumptions {{about the relationship between}} local sea level and global sea level. Sea level is often viewed as a simple function of changing global ice volume. This perspective neglects local variability, which arises from several factors, including the distortion of the geoid and the elastic and isostatic deformation of the solid Earth by shifting ice masses. Accurate reconstruction of past global and local sea levels, as well as ice sheet volumes, therefore requires integrating globally distributed data sets of local sea <b>level</b> <b>indicators.</b> To assess the robustness of the IPCC's global estimate and search for patterns in local sea level that are diagnostic of meltwater sources, we have compiled a comprehensive database that includes a variety of local sea <b>level</b> <b>indicators</b> from 47 localities, as well as a global sea level record derived from oxygen isotopes. We generate a global synthesis from these data using a novel statistical approach that couples Gaussian process regression to Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation of geochronological errors. Our analysis strongly supports th...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for data on the {{sustainability}} of agriculture, not only with industry but especially also with researchers and policy makers who have to monitor and evaluate the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), including its cross‐compliance, greening and rural development measures. The FLINT project (‘Farm <b>Level</b> <b>Indicators</b> for New Topics in policy evaluation’) has investigated options to collect such data. In nine member states of the European Union (EU), with different systems of data collection at farm level, it has collected and analysed sustainability data from 1, 099 farms in the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). The additional farm‐level data was collected in nine countries ‐ The Netherlands, Hungary, Finland, Poland, Spain, Ireland, Greece, France and Germany – and for eight types of farming (TF). Appendix A shows the distribution of farms within the FLINT sample. Within the FLINT project, the objective of Workpackage (WP) 5 is to analyse the added value of the newly collected farm <b>level</b> <b>indicators</b> for policy evaluation. The data available in the FLINT project includes accountancy data from FADN, the ‘FADN data’, as well as additional data on economic, environmental and social sustainability of farms, ‘FLINT data’, and sustainability indicators computed with this data. Several WP 5 analyses have been performed on specific topics, leading to 15 case study deliverables 5. 2. The present deliverable, the last one of WP 5, uses all this to draw lessons on {{the usefulness of the}} information collected during the FLINT project and in particular whether the farm <b>level</b> <b>indicators</b> developed in FLINT can help improve policy evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 11 was {{possibly}} the longest (∼ 423, 000 – 362, 000 yr ago) and warmest interglacial {{of the entire}} Quaternary Period. This resulted from a special arrangement of Earth 2 ̆ 7 s orbital parameters-similar to the present interglacial (MIS 1) -suggesting that MIS 11 provides an analogue for future natural climate forcing and sea levels. Although precise documentation of MIS 11 sea level history is, therefore, crucial – especially considering additional impetus from anthropogenic warming – the maximum MIS 11 sea level remains highly contentious. Estimates from onshore indicators have ranged from below present sea level to about + 20 m, resulting from uncertainties in reliability of sea <b>level</b> <b>indicators,</b> estimates of their subsequent displacement by vertical crustal motion and in dating. We used a clear and unambiguous sea <b>level</b> <b>indicator</b> (interface between subtidal and intertidal deposits) in well exposed, regressive raised shoreline deposits along South Africa 2 ̆ 7 s southern coast. The coast is stable in terms of tectonic setting and falls within a zone of low predicted glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA) and low sensitivity for plausible model parameters. The sea <b>level</b> <b>indicators</b> were directly dated using thermally transferred optically stimulated luminescence (TT-OSL), which gave {{a mean age of}} ∼ 390 ka, corresponding with MIS 11. We determined a precise maximum elevation of + 14 m for the MIS 11 sea <b>level</b> <b>indicator,</b> which corrected for minor crustal uplift and GIA yielded a eustatic sea level of + 13 m ± 2 m. The complete MIS 11 transgressive/regressive shoreline succession is preserved and the wave-cut platform extends 950 m inland from the present shoreline, indicating a prolonged highstand. We have also documented sea level fluctuations during MIS 11, including an earlier (lower) highstand close to present sea level, which may explain the lower elevation range of some previous estimates. At one locality, MIS 11 deposits form a sea cliff against which MIS 5 e sediments (at an elevation of + 6. 2 m) abut. The + 13 m MIS 11 sea level tallies with total melting of the Greenland and West Antarctica ice sheets, regarded as most susceptible to melting. Our data predict notably higher sea levels in the future, regardless of anthropogenic influence on climate...|$|R
