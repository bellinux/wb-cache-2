40|$|Bibliography: pages 164 - 167. This thesis {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the stability of <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> that are connected with distributed generators. Due to the restructuring of the electricity industry in the region as well as environmental concerns, distributed generation is bound to increase at a higher rate in the Southern African region in the near future. Southern Africa, like many other developing regions, is dominated by electrically weak <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> that have relatively high impedance lines. These networks suffer extreme voltage fluctuations when a transient disturbance occurs on the network. The distributed generators are connected onto <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> that were designed to operate without any generation, but were designed to receive power from the transmission networks. Once distributed generators are connected to <b>distribution</b> <b>networks,</b> a number of technical challenges are presented. One of the technical challenges includes investigating the stability of <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> connected with distributed generation. It would be beneficial to know what effect the connection of distributed generators onto <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> would have on the system stability. This is because if the connection of distributed generators onto <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> increases instability on the network, the quality of supply of that network would be degraded, therefore the connection of distributed generators must be limited or methods of improving the stability must be implemented. It is important to establish the measures that can be taken {{to make sure that the}} generators react in a stable manner when subjected to disturbances and to make sure that the local system stability is not compromised. The first objective of this thesis was to identify the types of generators that are likely to be connected to Southern African <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> and investigate their stability. The next objective was to design model <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> that would be utilised to highlight key stability issues that are raised when distributed generation is connected to <b>distribution</b> <b>networks.</b> The third objective was to conduct and analyse stability studies on model as well as existing Southern African <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> connected with distributed generation, including the assessment of the implications of potential instability such as on the quality of supply. The last objective was to identify various ways of improving the stability of <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> that are connected with distributed generation...|$|R
30|$|Electric vehicle {{charging}} and discharging technologies mainly have four modes, i.e. unidirectional disordered charging mode, unidirectional ordered charging mode, and bidirectional ordered charging and discharging modes. Unidirectional charging mode can only receive electricity from <b>distribution</b> <b>networks,</b> but cannot feed the surplus electricity of EVs back to <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> [36]. Bidirectional ordered charging and discharging modes {{mean that the}} EVs are connected with and controlled by the energy management system of <b>distribution</b> <b>networks.</b> The batteries of EVs are regarded as the moving power storage equipment and stand-by power source to realize the energy conversion with <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> [37].|$|R

30|$|As an {{important}} part of smart grid technologies, V 2 G technology can achieve the interaction between <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> and EVs. The development of V 2 G technology will have a great influence on the future commercial operation mode of EVs. Research shows that plug-in hybrids electric vehicles (PHEVs) and pure EVs will become an indivisible part of the distribution systems within 20  years along with the development of smart vehicles and smart grid. They can provide energy storage, balance the demand of <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> and improve the ability of emergency power supply and the stability of <b>distribution</b> <b>networks.</b> Research also shows that more than 90 % of passenger vehicles are driven about 1  h a day on average and 95 % of the time is in idle state. If the number of EVs at standstill are large enough, they can be used as removable distributed energy storage devices when they are connected with <b>distribution</b> <b>networks.</b> Consequently, they can provide the surplus electricity to <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> while still meeting the driving demand of EV consumers.|$|R
40|$|The optimal {{power flow}} (OPF) problem is funda- mental in power <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> control and {{operation}} that underlies many important {{applications such as}} volt/var control and demand response, etc [...] Large-scale highly volatile renewable penetration in the <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> calls for real-time feed- back control, and hence the need for distributed solutions for the OPF problem. <b>Distribution</b> <b>networks</b> are inherently unbalanced {{and most of the}} existing distributed solutions for balanced networks do not apply. In this paper we propose a solution for unbalanced <b>distribution</b> <b>networks.</b> Our distributed algorithm is based on alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). Unlike existing approaches that require to solve semidefinite programming problems in each ADMM macro-iteration, we exploit the problem structures and decompose the OPF problem {{in such a way that}} the subproblems in each ADMM macro- iteration reduce to either a closed form solution or eigen-decomposition of a 6 x 6 hermitian matrix, which significantly reduce the convergence time.

40|$|With a large {{penetration}} of low carbon technologies (LCTs) at medium voltage and low voltage levels, electricity <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> are undergoing rapid changes. Much {{research has been}} carried out to analyse the impact of employing LCTs in <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> based on either real or synthetic network samples. Results of such studies are usually case specific and of limited applicability to other networks. Topological properties of a <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> describe how different network components are located and connected, which are critical for the investigation of network performance. However, the number of network modelling and simulation platforms are limited in the open literature which can provide random realistic representations of electricity <b>distribution</b> <b>networks.</b> Thus, it is difficult to arrive to generalized and robust conclusions on impact studies of LCTs. As the initial step to bridge this gap, this paper studies the topological properties of real-world electricity <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> at the medium voltage level by employing the techniques from complex networks analysis and graph theory. The networks have been modelled as graphs with nodes representing electrical components of the network and links standing for the connections between the nodes through distribution lines. The key topological properties that characterize different types (urban and sub-urban) of <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> have been identified and quantified. A novel approach to obtain depth-dependent topological properties has also been developed. Results show that the node degree and edge length related graph properties are a key to characterize different types of electricity <b>distribution</b> <b>networks</b> and depth dependent network properties are able to better characterize the topological properties of urban and sub-urban networks...|$|R
5|$|The Denny Substation {{will have}} an initial {{capacity}} of 50 Megavolt-ampere (MVA), and could increase to 405 MVA with facilities expansions.

The use of a gas-insulated switchgear in the Denny Substation will allow for a smaller footprint; the facility will also use solar cells to produce its electricity and a heat recovery system.|$|E
