5|$|In {{telecommunication}} networks, heterodyning {{is used to}} move {{frequencies of}} <b>individual</b> <b>signals</b> to different channels which may share a single physical transmission line. This is called frequency division multiplexing (FDM). For example, a coaxial cable used by a cable television system can carry 500 television channels {{at the same time}} because each one is given a different frequency, so they don't interfere with one another. Continuous wave (CW) doppler radar detectors are basically heterodyne detection devices that compare transmitted and reflected beams.|$|E

25|$|The most {{effective}} clutter reduction technique is pulse-Doppler radar. Doppler separates clutter from {{aircraft and spacecraft}} using a frequency spectrum, so <b>individual</b> <b>signals</b> can be separated from multiple reflectors located in the same volume using velocity differences. This requires a coherent transmitter. Another technique uses a moving target indicator that subtracts the receive signal from two successive pulses using phase to reduce signals from slow moving objects. This can be adapted for systems that lack a coherent transmitter, such as time-domain pulse-amplitude radar.|$|E

30|$|To probe each CDIsp, the ST has {{to learn}} the {{individual}} transmit power adaptation for each PR in primary system. However, the ST receives a sum of transmit signals from the PT for two PRs under the BC channel, rather than two <b>individual</b> transmit <b>signals.</b> Therefore, the ST has to estimate the <b>individual</b> <b>signal</b> power for each PR from the received sum signals.|$|R
25|$|The North–South Railway line uses a {{semi-automatic}} block system, {{which allows}} <b>individual</b> <b>signals</b> to work either as automatic signals or manual signals. These replace the token method used in earlier years. According {{to a joint}} Japanese-Vietnamese evaluation team, the recent installation of additional auto-signal systems at key crossings along the line has contributed {{to a decline in}} railway accidents. Semaphore signals were once used throughout the Vietnamese rail network, but these are gradually being replaced with colour light signals; most of the railway lines in northern Vietnam have been converted.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary purpose}} is to measure both the {{amplitude}} and frequency of the aggregate reflected signal from multiple distances. This is used with weather radar to measure radial wind velocity and precipitation rate in each different volume of air. This is linked with computing systems to produce a real-time electronic weather map. Aircraft safety depends upon continuous access to accurate weather radar information {{that is used to}} prevent injuries and accidents. Weather radar uses a low PRF. Coherency requirements are not as strict as those for military systems because <b>individual</b> <b>signals</b> ordinarily {{do not need to be}} separated. Less sophisticated filtering is required, and range ambiguity processing is not normally needed with weather radar in comparison with military radar intended to track air vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|Intraspecies {{signaling}} occurs {{especially in}} bacteria, yeast, social insects, but also many vertebrates. The signaling molecules used by multicellular organisms are often called pheromones. [...] They can have such purposes as alerting against danger, indicating food supply, or assisting in reproduction. In unicellular organisms such as bacteria, signaling {{can be used}} to 'activate' peers from a dormant state, enhance virulence, defend against bacteriophages, etc. In quorum sensing, which is also found in social insects, the multiplicity of <b>individual</b> <b>signals</b> has the potentiality to create a positive feedback loop, generating coordinated response. [...] In this context, the signaling molecules are called autoinducers. This signaling mechanism may have been involved in evolution from unicellular to multicellular organisms. Bacteria also use contact-dependent signaling, notably to limit their growth.|$|E
50|$|Some Motorola pagers could decode four {{different}} <b>individual</b> 5-tone <b>signals</b> (see SelCall above).

40|$|Temporal {{coherence}} of <b>individual</b> <b>signal</b> or idler beam, {{determined by the}} spectral correlation property of photon pairs, is important for realizing quantum interference among independent sources. To understand the effect of chirp on the temporal coherence property, two series of experiments are investigated by introducing different amount of chirp into either the pulsed pump or <b>individual</b> <b>signal</b> (idler) beam. In the first one, based on spontaneous four wave mixing {{in a piece of}} optical fiber, the intensity correlation function of the filtered <b>individual</b> <b>signal</b> beam, which characterizes the degree of temporal coherence, is measured {{as a function of the}} chirp of pump. The results demonstrate that the chirp of pump pulses decreases the degree of temporal coherence. In the second one, a Hong-Ou-Mandel type two-photon interference experiment with the signal beams generated in two different fibers is carried out. The results illustrate that the chirp of individual beam does not change the temporal coherence degree, but affect the temporal mode matching. To achieve high visibility, apart from improving the coherence degree by minimizing the chirp of pump, mode matching should be optimized by managing the chirps of individual beams.

2500|$|Natterer's bat is nocturnal and insectivorous. It emerges at dusk to {{hunt for}} insects and uses {{echolocation}} to find prey and orient itself at night. Like many other species of bat, it emits sounds at too high a frequency for most humans to detect and then interprets the echoes created {{in order to build}} a [...] "sound picture" [...] of its surroundings. The frequencies used by this bat species for echolocation lie between 23–115kHz and have most energy at 53kHz. The <b>individual</b> <b>signals</b> have an average duration of 3.8 ms. The wide bandwidth of its frequency-modulated search signals enables it to detect prey only a few centimetres from vegetation and it does not use vision, olfaction or sounds emitted by its prey for this purpose. The bat feeds on the wing and it mostly catches insects in flight but it is also able to feed on prey items such as spiders and caterpillars dangling close to foliage on silken threads.|$|E
50|$|Separate {{observations}} of the paddlefish hunting in the wild have provided evidence that the background noise generated by plankton increase the paddlefish's hunting abilities. Each individual organism generates a particular electrical signal; these <b>individual</b> <b>signals</b> cause massed groups of plankton to emit {{what amounts to a}} noisy background signal. It has been found that the paddlefish does not respond to only noise without signals from nearby individual organisms, so it uses the strong <b>individual</b> <b>signals</b> of nearby plankton to acquire specific targets, and the background electrical noise provides a cue to their presence. For these reasons, {{it is likely that the}} paddlefish takes advantage of stochastic resonance to improve its sensitivity to prey.|$|E

DBChIP and MAnorm are examples for one stage differential peak callers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this correspondence, we {{consider}} sequential prediction of a real-valued <b>individual</b> <b>signal</b> from its past noisy samples, under square error loss. We refrain from making any stochastic assumptions on {{the generation of}} the underlying desired signal and try to achieve uniformly good performance for any deterministic and arbitrary <b>individual</b> <b>signal.</b> We investigate this problem in a competitive framework, where we construct algorithms that perform {{as well as the}} best algorithm in a competing class of algorithms for each desired signal. Here, the best algorithm in the competition class can be tuned to the underlying desired clean signal even before processing any of the data. Three different frameworks under additive noise are considered: the class of a finite number of algorithms; the class of all th order linear predictors (for some fixed order); and finally the class of all switching th order linear predictors.

This chapter summarizes recent approaches to surface patterning such as topography and chemical patterning from the micrometer to the nanometer scale, and illustrates their application to cellular studies. Particular attention is devoted to nanolithography with self‐assembled diblock copolymer micelles that are biofunctionalized with peptide ligands—a method that offers unsurpassed spatial resolution for the positioning of signaling molecules over extended surface areas. Such interfaces are defined here as “nano‐digital surfaces,” since they enable the counting of <b>individual</b> <b>signaling</b> complexes separated by a biologically inert background.
