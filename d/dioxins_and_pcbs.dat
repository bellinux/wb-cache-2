In other words, the EU assumes there is no safe level of <b>dioxins</b> <b>and</b> <b>PCBs.</b> Accordingly, the European Union sets extremely stringent limits for dioxin and dioxin like PCBs in food, set just above the usual background levels found in various food categories e.g. fish, poultry, beef, pork etc. The limit set for dioxins in pork fat and meat is 1 pg/g TEQ i.e. 1 parts per trillion (ppt) (see swimming pool illustration). The maximum dioxin contamination measured in Irish pork was 0.2 ng/g TEQ fat (200 ppt), equivalent to dispersing 10 drops of TCDD throughout a 2.5 million litre Olympic sized swimming pool.|$|E

Overall, these data show that exposure to <b>dioxins</b> <b>and</b> dioxin-like <b>PCBs</b> rapidly results in increased levels in eggs and that the current EU limit for feed cannot guarantee egg levels below the EU-limit. Therefore, dioxin levels in chicken feed should be as low as possible and the current limit for dioxins in feed should be further reduced, at least in the case of chicken feeds. More in general, it is important to further harmonize the tolerance limits for feed and edible products like meat, eggs and milk.

40|$|<b>Dioxin</b> <b>and</b> dioxin-like {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs) are {{ubiquitous}} {{in the environment}} and up to 90 - 95 % of them are ingested by people from food. In food there is mostly a mixture of these substances. In order to improve the estimation of the toxicity of <b>dioxins</b> <b>and</b> dioxin-like <b>PCBs,</b> the system of toxic equivalents (TEQs) was introduced. The toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) {{play a key role}} in calculating the toxic equivalents (TEQs). The World Health Organisation (WHO) compiled a list of toxic equivalency factors (WHO-TEFs) in 1998 on the basis of which the EU maximum levels for <b>dioxins</b> <b>and</b> dioxin-like <b>PCBs</b> in food were established.

The changes to some WHO-TEFs, which have now been undertaken, are based according to WHO on provisional and statistical considerations in conjunction with an unchanged toxicological data situation and constitute an interim solution. Calculations by BfR by way of example show that the new TEFs in some cases lead to TEQ values which are between 10 - 20 % lower, i. e. lead to a lower classification of the toxicity of <b>dioxins</b> <b>and</b> dioxin-like <b>PCBs.</b> This means that, as a consequence of the new WHO-TEFs, consumers could ingest higher levels of <b>dioxins</b> <b>and</b> dioxin-like <b>PCBs</b> from food until in purely arithmetic terms the maximum tolerable daily intake laid down by WHO of 1 - 4 picogram WHO-TEQ per kilogram (pg/kg) body weight would be reached.
