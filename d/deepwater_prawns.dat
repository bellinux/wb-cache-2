40|$|The Western Deepwater Trawl Fishery (WDTF) {{began in}} 1987 as an {{extension}} of the North West Slope Trawl Fishery (NWSTF) as operators extended their exploratory fishing for scampi and <b>deepwater</b> <b>prawns.</b> Following poor crustacean catches, the fishery evolved into a finfish trawl fishery of considerable species diversity (> 50 species; Moore et al. 2007 a). It is best classified as a byproduct/mixed fish species fishery due to the wide range of species taken in low volumes. In recent years, bugs have been targeted and now form the majority of the catch. According to logbooks, between a third and a half of the total catch is discarded. Of the discards, about a quarter is unidentified. The fishery is characterised by two distinct areas: north and south of 27 °S (Moore et al. 2007 a). The WDTF is open all year but operators generally have chosen to access the fishery on a part-time or opportunistic basis as an adjunct to other Commonwealth and State fisheries, particularly the Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF), and the Great Australian Bight Sector (GABTS) of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF). The Gross Value of Production (GVP) peaked at $ 2. 5 million in 2002 / 03 but has since declined dramatically in line with decreasing effort. The 2008 / 09 catch was from one fishing vessel and comprised only 28 t of ruby snapper and little else; the 2008 / 09 GVP was not disclosed because it was derived from less than five vessels (Wilson et al. 2010) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{deepwater}} chondrichthyan fauna of the Great Barrier Reef {{is poorly}} known and life history information {{is required to}} enable their effective management as they are inherently vulnerable to exploitation. The chondrichthyan bycatch from the <b>deepwater</b> eastern king <b>prawn</b> fishery at the Swain Reefs in the southern Great Barrier Reef was examined to determine the species present and provide information on their life histories. In all, 1533 individuals were collected from 11 deepwater chondrichthyan species, with the Argus skate Dipturus polyommata, piked spurdog Squalus megalops and pale spotted catshark Asymbolus pallidus the most commonly caught. All but one species is endemic to Australia with five species restricted to waters offshore from Queensland. The extent of life history information available for each species varied but the life history traits across all species were characteristic of deep water chondrichthyans with relatively large length at maturity, small litters and low ovarian fecundity; all indicative of low biological productivity. However, variability among these traits and spatial and bathymetric distributions of the species suggests differing degrees of resilience to fishing pressure. To ensure the sustainability of these bycatch species, monitoring of their catches in the <b>deepwater</b> eastern king <b>prawn</b> fishery is recommended...|$|R
40|$|This paper quantifies {{the effects}} of a square mesh codend bycatch {{reduction}} device (BRD) and turtle excluder device (TED) in the <b>deepwater</b> eastern king <b>prawn</b> (Melicertus plebejus) fishery on the southeast Queensland coast, based upon on a 10 -day research charter. The bycatch comprised 224 taxa, mainly gurnards, flatheads, sandpaper fish, hermit and charybdid crabs, mantis shrimps, sand dollars (i. e. sea urchins), dragonets, snipefish, carids and lizardfish. The total mean bycatch rate was comparatively low (1114. 0 g ha− 1 from the standard diamond mesh codend), mainly because of the relatively deep waters associated with the fishery. When the TED and square mesh codend BRD were used together the total mean bycatch rate was significantly reduced by 29...|$|R
40|$|According to the {{collective}} experience of Hilborn, Orensanz and Parma {{one of the three}} primary causes for unexpected failure in fisheries is the mismatch between the scale of fished populations, and the scale of their assessment and management. Developed initially through my doctoral studies of abalone (haliotids) but cemented through subsequent experience with fisheries for lobster, penaeid <b>prawns,</b> <b>deepwater</b> teleosts, sharks and marine mammals my bias promotes the “tyranny of scale” to the top of Hilborn et al. ’s list. Early in my career while still working within the constraints of a fisheries agency the challenge of assessing and managing a world filled with micro-stocks seemed insurmountable. However, after almost thirty years working on the interface between fishing communities and government agencies I believe solutions are in sight. Solving the issue of sustaining spatially complex marine resources requires: • Cultivating the more human approach embodied by Johannes. • Flexibly scaled social systems implemented and motivated with dedicated access privileges linked directly to the • Responsibility to fish for data as well as profit. • A new breed of fisheries practitioners; barefoot ecologists, pragmatic generalists armed with • A toolbox full of generic pragmatic approaches; flexible survey designs, scale-less assessment techniques, data-less or rule-of-thumb management prescriptions, and software tools for mapping, modeling and visualization...|$|R
40|$|The chondrichthyan (shark, batoid and holocephalan) bycatch of the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery (ECTF) was {{examined}} {{through a series}} of fishery-independent trawl surveys, together with fishery-dependent (opportunistic) sampling. Project aims were to document the chondrichthyan bycatch composition in order to test the effectiveness of turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) and bycatch reduction devices (BRDs), to examine biological aspects of bycatch species, and to combine data collected through these parts to assess the conservation status and sustainability of bycatch species. A total of 37 chondrichthyan species (one holocephalan, 19 batoids and 17 sharks) from 18 families were recorded in the bycatch of the fishery. The most speciose families recorded were the stingrays (Dasyatidae; 7 species), the requiem sharks (Carcharhinidae; 5 species), the catsharks (Scyliorhinidae; 4 species) and the stingarees (Urolophidae; 3 species). Chondrichthyan bycatch was highly variable between fishery sectors; catch rates were low in the tiger/Endeavour prawn sector (north Queensland; 0. 02 – 0. 12 individuals ha- 1 trawled) and in the eastern king <b>prawn</b> (<b>deepwater)</b> sector (southern Queensland; 0. 08 individuals ha- 1 trawled), intermediate in Hervey Bay (southern Queensland; 0. 25 individuals ha- 1 trawled) and in the scallop sector (central Queensland coast; 0. 31 individuals ha- 1 trawled) and highest in the eastern king prawn (shallow water) sector (southern Queensland; 0. 96 individuals ha- 1 trawled). Chondrichthyan bycatch in the eastern king prawn (shallow water) sector was dominated by the three batoids Aptychotrema rostrata, Trygonoptera testacea and Urolophus kapalensis (~ 92 % of the chondrichthyan bycatch by number), in the eastern king <b>prawn</b> (<b>deepwater)</b> sector by the skate Dipturus polyommata and the two catsharks Asymbolus rubiginosus and Figaro boardmani (~ 83 % of the chondrichthyan bycatch by number), in the scallop sector by the three batoids A. rostrata, Neotrygon kuhlii and Neotrygon picta (~ 91 % of the chondrichthyan bycatch by number), and in the tiger/Endeavour prawn sector by the two batoids Himantura astra and Gymnura australis and the two sharks Chiloscyllium punctatum and Hemigaleus australiensis (~ 67 % of the chondrichthyan bycatch by number). The testing of TEDs and BRDs, which are mandatory throughout the fishery, demonstrated only a limited ability to reduce chondrichthyan bycatch in the ECTF, which is comprised mainly of relatively small species. The shorter trawl durations of the surveys compared with normal commercial activities may have under-represented larger species. No significant reductions in chondrichthyan bycatch were found using a TED and a radial escape section BRD in the eastern king prawn (shallow water) sector, using a TED and a square-mesh codend BRD in the eastern king <b>prawn</b> (<b>deepwater)</b> sector, or using a TED and a fisheye BRD in Hervey Bay. There was however, {{a significant difference in the}} probability of capturing the group ‘sharks and guitarfishes’ (comprised largely of A. rostrata) between codend types in the scallop sector, with the lowest probability of capture in nets fitted with both a TED and a square-mesh codend BRD (the difference was largely attributed to the effects of the TED). In the tiger/Endeavour prawn sector, in which three different BRDs were trialed (fisheye, square-mesh codend, square-mesh panel), the probability of capturing chondrichthyans was significantly lower in nets fitted with a fisheye BRD than in the standard (control) net, and the probability of capturing batoids was significantly lower in nets fitted with a fisheye BRD or with a square-mesh codend BRD than in the standard (control) net. The small sample size of chondrichthyan catches in some sectors may have reduced to power to detect bycatch reduction. The biology of several bycatch species from the families Rajidae, Rhinobatidae, Urolophidae and Scyliorhinidae {{was examined}}. For D. polyommata, size at birth was estimated at ~ 100 – 110 mm total length (LT), size at first feeding at ~ 105 – 110 mm LT, size at 50 % maturity (LT 50 and 95 % CI) at 321 (305 – 332) mm LT for females and 300 (285 – 306) mm LT for males. Diet (described by the index of relative importance as a percentage) was predominantly crustacean based, with carid shrimps (53. 6 %) and penaeoid prawns (23. 3 %) being the most significant prey groups. For A. rostrata, size at birth was estimated a...|$|R
40|$|As {{fisheries}} {{move into}} deeper waters {{the ability of}} deepwater chondrichthyans to sustain fishing is relatively unknown, although the limited information to date suggests most are inherently vulnerable to exploitation. Knowledge of deepwater chondrichthyans life history traits is required to enable effective management of deepwater chondrichthyans, as life history traits are important indicators of the productivity of species and consequently, species abilities to tolerate fishing pressure. This dissertation aimed to further knowledge of the life histories of deepwater chondrichthyans by assessing patterns in their traits and studying the life history of species taken as bycatch in a deepwater trawl fishery within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. It also {{addressed the issue of}} the inability to age many deepwater chondrichthyans through investigation of a novel approach to ageing, that is, by using near infrared spectroscopy. The association of chondrichthyan life history traits and habitat was examined among the three main marine habitats of shelf, pelagic and deepwater, and also within the deepwater habitat. Life history traits were obtained from 226 populations of chondrichthyans across the three habitats. These traits were analysed for patterns using a linear mixed effects model that controlled for the correlation among species due to their common evolutionary history. Life history differences were identified between chondrichthyans from shelf, pelagic and deepwater habitats, and within the deep habitat down the continental slope. Deepwater species as a group, had lower growth rates, later age at maturity and higher longevity than both shelf and pelagic groups of species. In the deep habitat, with increasing depth, most species matured later, lived longer, had smaller litters and bred less frequently. The group of deepwater species also had a smaller body size than the groups of shelf and pelagic species, which indicates body size is not appropriate as a predictor of vulnerability in most deepwater chondrichthyans. The visual interaction hypothesis offers a potential explanation for these findings, and it is apparent habitat influences the trade-offs in allocation of energy for survival and reproduction. In general, deepwater chondrichthyans are more vulnerable to exploitation than shelf and pelagic species and this vulnerability markedly increases with increasing depth. The life history traits of the deepwater chondrichthyans as a group are unique from the shelf and pelagic groups of species, and reflect adaptations driven by both mortality and resource limitations of their habitat. The chondrichthyan bycatch from the <b>deepwater</b> eastern king <b>prawn</b> fishery at the Swain Reefs, in the southern Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, was sampled onboard two commercial prawn trawlers. In all, 1533 individuals were collected from 11 deepwater chondrichthyan species, with a skate, Dipturus polyommata, most dominant by number at 50...|$|R
