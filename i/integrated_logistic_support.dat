40|$|The paper envisages the {{application}} of <b>integrated</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>support</b> conception (ILS) for space equipment {{on the base of}} the example of the student’s «Sail BMSTU» midget spacecraft (MS). The peculiarities of space equipment logistic support in operation phase are considered. The special focus is done to the problem of decrease in production expenses of spacecrafts. The paper suggests that the solution of this problem has to be based on tools commonly used in engineering fields – functional analysis and FMECA. The fragment of FMECA is presented. Due to FMECA it is clear what products in spacecrafts should be calibrated in accordance with quality requirements of military class and what ones should be calibrated in accordance with quality requirements of commercial and industrial classes. Each failure mode of midget spacecraft, identified within FMECA, is studied by assessing of criticality, severity and probability of emergence. The paper describes the main procedures of <b>integrated</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>support</b> on the base of the student’s «Sail MGTU» midget spacecraft. Recommended guidelines providing reliability of electro radio products are elaborated. The practical application of <b>integrated</b> <b>logistic</b> <b>support</b> in aerospace industry is reasonably presented...|$|E
