500|$|..... And when Michel {{gets his}} strokes of genius and, {{in the video}} for [...] "Army of Me", wants a dentist that's a gorilla to find a diamond in my mouth, some people call it nonsense. But it's {{probably}} the most realistic way of expressing what situation I'm in - all these people trying to take things away from me, and the gorilla finding a diamond that I don't know I have and then stealing it. [...] "Army of Me" [...] is so much about me actually learning that I have to <b>defend</b> <b>myself.</b> I {{have to stand up}} and fight the fucking gorilla. Once I've got the diamond and I run away with it, it becomes massive 'cos it's mine. But if the gorilla had kept it, it would have gone really tiny. That's surrealism for me.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the season, O'Ree faced blatant racism from opponents, {{remarking}} [...] "people {{just wanted}} a piece of me, maybe because they thought I was different, so I had to <b>defend</b> <b>myself.</b> [...] I wasn't going to be run out of any rink." [...] He endured racial slurs from fans in each of Chicago, Detroit and New York, though the taunts were largely absent in Montreal and Toronto. [...] O'Ree was supported by his teammates and Boston fans. He stated [...] "they were mean to me in places like Detroit and New York, too. [...] But never in Boston. [...] I'll never forget how my teammates there took care of me — men like Johnny Bucyk, Doug Mohns, Charlie Burns and Don McKenney. [...] They accepted me totally. [...] All of them had class." [...] In 1961, O'Ree was traded to Montreal {{but was unable to}} crack the Canadiens' line-up. [...] Playing over 20 minor league seasons, O'Ree twice won the Western Hockey League's scoring title: in 1964, with the Los Angeles Blades, and in 1969, with the San Diego Gulls.|$|E

500|$|From Molossia, Themistocles {{apparently}} fled to Pydna, {{from where}} he took a ship for Asia Minor. This ship was blown off course by a storm, and ended up at Naxos, which an Athenian fleet {{was in the process}} of besieging. Desperate to avoid identification, Themistocles pestered the captain of the ship to continue the journey immediately. According to Thucydides, who wrote within living memory of the events, the ship eventually landed safely at Ephesus, where Themistocles disembarked. Plutarch has the ship docking at Cyme in Aeolia, and Diodorus has Themistocles making his way to Asia in an undefined manner. Diodorus and Plutarch next recount a similar tale, namely that Themistocles stayed briefly with an acquaintance (Lysitheides or Nicogenes) who was also acquainted with the Persian king, Artaxerxes I. Since there was a bounty on Themistocles's head, this acquaintance devised a plan to safely convey Themistocles to the Persian king in the type of covered wagon that the King's concubines travelled in. All three chroniclers agree that Themistocles's next move was to contact the Persian king; in Thucydides, this is by letter, while Plutarch and Diodorus have a face-to-face meeting with the king. The spirit is, however, the same in all three: Themistocles introduces himself to the king and seeks to enter his service: [...] "I, Themistocles, am come to you, who did your house more harm than any of the Hellenes, when I was compelled to <b>defend</b> <b>myself</b> against your father's invasion—harm, however, far surpassed by the good that I did him during his retreat, which brought no danger for me but much for him." [...] (Thucydides) ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 26, 2007, a senatorial aide of Webb, Phillip Thompson, {{was arrested}} for {{carrying}} Webb's loaded pistol {{as he entered the}} Russell Senate Office Building and for carrying unregistered ammunition. The weapon was discovered when Thompson went through an X-ray machine with a briefcase that contained a loaded pistol and two additional loaded magazines. Charges against the aide were dismissed after prosecutors concluded it could not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Thompson was aware that the gun and ammunition were in the briefcase. Webb responded to his aide's arrest by reiterating his support for gun-owners' rights:"I'm a strong supporter of the Second Amendment; I have had a permit to carry a weapon in Virginia for a long time; I believe that it's important; it's important to me personally and {{to a lot of people}} in the situation that I'm in to be able to <b>defend</b> <b>myself</b> and my family." ...|$|E

They don't allow me to <b>defend</b> <b>myself</b> in an open court {{to the public and}} convince a jury that what I did was to their benefit. ... So it's, I would say, illustrative that the President would choose to say someone should face the music when he knows the music is a show trial." [...] Snowden's legal representative, Jesselyn Radack, wrote that [...] "the Espionage Act effectively hinders a person from defending himself before a jury in an open court." [...] She said that the [...] "arcane World War I law" [...] was never meant to prosecute whistleblowers, but rather spies who sold secrets to enemies for profit.|$|E
2500|$|When Leguizamo {{was four}} years old, his family immigrated to the United States, and lived in various neighborhoods in Queens, New York, {{including}} Jackson Heights. He later credited growing up {{as one of the}} first Latino children in the neighborhood as formative in his acting ability: [...] "It was tough. There were lots of fights. I would walk through a park and be attacked, and I had to <b>defend</b> <b>myself</b> all the time. But this helped me to become funny so that I wouldn’t get hit." [...] Leguizamo attended the Joseph Pulitzer Middle School (I.S.145) and later the Murry Bergtraum High School. As a student at Murry Bergtraum, he wrote comedy material and tested it on his classmates. He was voted [...] "Most Talkative" [...] by his classmates. After graduating from high school, he began his theater career as an undergraduate at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, from which he eventually dropped out in favor of a career in stand-up comedy. Post-NYU, Leguizamo enrolled at LIU Post, where he took theater classes.|$|E
2500|$|Svyret opposed {{proposals}} for the Limited Liability Partnerships (Jersey) Law 1997, which {{was sponsored by}} two UK accountants firms. During the debate, Syvret stated [...] "Senator Jeune has, {{in his capacity as}} President of the Policy and Resources Committee, used his influence to speed up the Law Drafting process and get this matter brought through. He has spoken on this matter in the House and at Committee meetings, even though he has a financial interest in this matter". Reginald Jeune was a founding partner in one of Jersey's largest law firms Mourant, du Feu & Jeune. [...] That firm was engaged by two accounting firms from the UK to assist them in getting this controversial law on the Statute book. Reginald Jeune had stood down as a partner for the law firm several years previously. It was not disputed that he was engaged as a Consultant by the law firm, and continued to have an office and secretary in the firms headquarters. He claimed {{that he did not know}} that his law firm was acting for Price Waterhouse, that his position in the law firm was an honorary one, and that his office and secretarial support from that law firm were to assist him in his States work. These claims were never investigated. The Bailiff Sir Philip Bailhache, as presiding officer of the States assembly, subsequently wrote to Syvret, referring to the standing order which stated [...] "No Member shall impute improper motives to any other Member", saying [...] "you have not provided me with any evidence to justify those imputations", inviting Syvret to discuss the matter, and giving notice that matter would be put to the States assembly after the summer recess. At the States assembly on 3 September 1996, Syvret refused to withdraw his statement, and was not allowed to speak. Members voted by 36 to 3 (with 4 abstentions) in favour of the proposition [...] "That Mr. Syvret be suspended from the service of the States until he has withdrawn, by notice in writing to the Greffier, his imputations of improper motives against Senator Jeune". In an interview shortly afterwards, Syvret told The Observer, [...] "I was not allowed to <b>defend</b> <b>myself.</b> This is like something out of George Orwell's 1984.... I was not allowed to <b>defend</b> <b>myself,</b> to speak on my behalf". UK MP Austin Mitchell described the States of Jersey's conduct in the matter as that of a [...] "legislature for hire" [...] and he sponsored an Early Day Motion in the UK Parliament critical of Syvret's suspension. The States of Jersey subsequently agreed to set up a committee of inquiry into procedural matters relating to the drafting of the legislation. On 4 March 1997, Svyret returned to address the States assembly and stated that he alleged only that Senator Jeune had breached Standing Orders 43 and 44 of the States of Jersey. As Syvret had not alleged improper motives against Senator Jeune he therefore could not withdraw an allegation which he had not made; Syvret left the States meeting and the States then resolved to censure him but to lift his suspension. In April 1998, Michael Beloff QC, sitting as a Commissioner of the Royal Court, struck out legal proceedings brought by Syvret challenging the legality of his suspension from the States assembly on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction over the legislature's internal procedures.|$|E
