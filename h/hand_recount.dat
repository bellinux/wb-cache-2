5|$|When the {{election}} returns were tallied on November 7, Bush had won 29 states, including Florida. The {{closeness of the}} Florida outcome led to a recount. The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 9, in the controversial Bush v. Gore ruling, the Court reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision that had ordered a third count, and stopped an ordered statewide <b>hand</b> <b>recount</b> based on {{the argument that the}} use of different standards among Florida's counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The machine recount showed that Bush had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast. Although he had received 543,895 fewer individual nationwide votes than Gore, Bush won {{the election}}, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266 (Gore's statewide victories had electoral votes tallying 267; however, one of Gore's pledged electors abstained, rendering the official tally at 266). Bush {{was the first person to}} win an American presidential election with fewer popular votes than another candidate since Benjamin Harrison in 1888.|$|E
25|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} on November 2, 2010, Dayton led his Republican opponent, Tom Emmer, {{at the close of}} balloting by just under 9,000 votes. The margin of victory was small enough to trigger an automatic recount under state law. Analysts generally thought it unlikely that Dayton's lead would be overturned. During the <b>hand</b> <b>recount</b> of ballots, Emmer failed to find enough questionable ballots to overturn Dayton's lead. Emmer conceded the election on December 8, 2010.|$|E
25|$|After {{several days}} of counting, the Division of Elections showed Murkowski with a lead of some 1,700 votes over Miller, with about 8,000 {{write-in}} votes yet to be counted, and a trend of counting 97 percent of the write-ins as for Murkowski. Murkowski's campaign shied away from declaring a victory before the count was finished. As of November 17, (the {{last day of the}} hand count), the Division of Elections showed Murkowski having a lead of over 10,000 votes, meaning that even if all the 8,000 challenged ballots were discounted, Murkowski would still lead by about 2,200 votes. The Miller campaign then demanded a <b>hand</b> <b>recount</b> of the entire election, claiming that as Murkowski's votes were all verified by visual inspection Miller should get the same opportunity. The Division of Election officials responded that any recount of non-write-in votes would not be done by hand, but would be done using optical scanners.|$|E

Nader/Camejo undertook a challenge to the results in New Hampshire.|$|R
50|$|Key points {{depicted}} include: Gore's retraction of {{his personal}} telephone concession to Bush {{in the early hours}} of November 8; the decision by the Gore campaign to sue for <b>hand</b> <b>recounts</b> in Democratic strongholds where voting irregularities were alleged, especially in light of the statistical dead heat revealed by the reported machine recount; Republican pressure on Florida’s Secretary of State Katherine Harris in light of her legally mandated responsibilities; the attention focused on the <b>hand</b> <b>recounts</b> by media, parties, and the public; the two major announcements by Florida Supreme Court spokesman Craig Waters extending the deadline for returns in the initial recount (November 21, 2000) and ordering a statewide recount of votes (December 8, 2000), and later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court; and finally the adversarial postures of the Supreme Courts of Florida and the United States, as well as the dissenting opinions among the higher court's justices.|$|R

2500|$|Bilbray won {{the runoff}} with 49% of the vote, and {{was sworn in}} on June 13, 2006, {{as a member of}} the Congress. The Republican Party {{considered}} this a bellwether race because this district had [...] "the perfect storm in favor of the Democrats" [...] according to Ken Mehlman, the RNC Chairman at the time of the special election. The Democratic National Committee's Voting Rights Institute raised several concerns about the fairness and accuracy of the vote count. An election contest lawsuit sought a <b>hand</b> <b>recount.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, a {{consortium}} of news organizations, assisted by professional statisticians , examined numerous hypothetical ways of recounting all the Florida ballots. The study was conducted {{over a period of}} 10 months. The consortium examined 175,010 ballots that vote-counting machines had rejected. In each alternative way of recounting the rejected ballots, the number of additional votes for Gore was smaller than the 537-vote lead that state election officials ultimately awarded Bush. Under the strategy that Al Gore pursued {{at the beginning of the}} Florida recount — filing suit to force hand recounts in four predominantly Democratic counties — Bush would have kept his lead, according to the ballot review conducted by the consortium. Likewise, if Florida's 67 counties had carried out the <b>hand</b> <b>recount</b> of disputed ballots ordered by the Florida Supreme Court on December 8, applying the standards that election officials said they would have used, Bush would have emerged the victor by 493 votes. On the other hand, the study also found that if the official vote-counting standards had not rejected ballots containing overvotes (where a voter selects more than one candidate in a race where each voter may only choose one candidate) a statewide tally would have resulted in Gore emerging as the victor by 60 to 171 votes. These tallies conducted by the NORC consortium are caveated with the statement: [...] "But no study of this type can accurately recreate Election Day 2000 or predict what might have emerged from individual battles over more than 6 million votes in Florida's 67 counties." ...|$|E
50|$|On November 25, 2016, the Commission {{received}} a petition from Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein for a <b>hand</b> <b>recount</b> {{of the votes}} in the state from the 2016 presidential election. On November 28, the Commission rejected Stein's request for a <b>hand</b> <b>recount.</b>|$|E
5000|$|During the recount, {{controversy}} ensued {{with the}} discovery of various irregularities that had occurred in the voting process in several counties. Among these was the Palm Beach [...] "butterfly ballot," [...] which resulted in an unusually high number of votes for Reform Party candidate Pat Buchanan. Conservatives claimed that the same ballot had been successfully used in the 1996 election; in fact, it had never been used in a Palm Beach County election among rival candidates for office. Also, before the election, the Secretary of State's office had expunged tens of thousands of citizens identified as felons from the Florida voting rolls, with African-Americans identified on some counties' lists at up to five times their share of the population. Democrats claimed that many of these were not felons and should have been eligible to vote under Florida law. It was expected that had they been able to vote, most would have chosen the Democratic candidate. Additionally, this Florida election produced many more [...] "overvotes" [...] than usual, especially in predominantly African-American precincts in Duval County (Jacksonville), where some 21,000 ballots had multiple markings, such as two or more choices for president. Unlike the much-discussed Palm Beach County butterfly ballot, the Duval County ballot spread choices for president over two non-facing pages. At {{the same time that the}} Bush campaign was contesting <b>hand</b> <b>recounts</b> in Democratic counties, it accepted <b>hand</b> <b>recounts</b> in Republican counties that gained them 185 votes, including votes where Republican Party workers were permitted to correct errors on thousands of applications for absentee ballots for Republicans. Alternately, Republicans charged that Democrats had registered non-citizens to vote, fought to exclude overseas military ballots, and arbitrarily changed vote-counting criteria after the election.|$|R
2500|$|This was {{the closest}} presidential {{election}} in the nation's history, with a [...]009% margin, 537 votes, separating the two candidates in the decisive state, Florida. The narrow margin there triggered a mandatory machine recount the next day, after which Gore requested <b>hand</b> <b>recounts</b> in four counties, including three in populous South Florida, as permitted by law. Litigation ensued in numerous counties in both state and federal courts, ultimately reaching the Florida Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court. The high court's contentious 5–4 decision in Bush v. Gore, announced on December 12, 2000, ended a statewide recount ordered by the Florida Supreme Court on December 8, effectively awarding Florida's votes to Bush and granting him the victory. Nationwide, this was the fourth presidential election in which the winner received fewer votes than his opponent.|$|R
50|$|The JLP's {{share of}} the vote was the lowest for a winning party since 1962, when the JLP won 50.0% of the vote, and its {{resulting}} majority in the House of Representatives was the narrowest since the 1949 elections.

50|$|Balducci won {{re-election}} {{with more}} than 65% of the vote, but the race between Stokes and Laing was very close. Stokes led after the initial count by only 51 votes out of 35,000 cast, which was a narrow enough margin to trigger a manual recount. The <b>hand</b> <b>recount</b> confirmed Stokes' victory and increased his margin to 54 votes.|$|E

5000|$|The {{actions of}} the Florida Supreme Court. It was argued, {{particularly}} by Republicans, that the court was exceeding its authority and issuing rulings biased in Gore's favor. On November 17, the court acted [...] "on its own motion" [...] to stay the official certification of the election until it could hear Gore's appeal of Harris's decision to reject late-filed <b>hand</b> <b>recounts,</b> while specifically allowing counting of absentee and other ballots to continue, an action the Gore legal team did not request. Similarly, the court's ruling of December 8, 2000, ordered a statewide counting of undervotes, which the Gore team had also not requested. James Baker, among other Republicans, in speaking of this ruling, accused the court of being [...] "inconsistent with Florida law", on which basis Bush appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Democrats argued that the Florida Supreme Court was simply trying to ensure a fair and accurate count.|$|R

50|$|Soon afterwards, {{war broke}} out in Europe and Will’s {{youngest}} brother, Stephen, was enlisted, only to be killed in France a year afterward. Bird had volunteered for service overseas {{at the same time}} as his brother, but was rejected due to his poor teeth. Will Bird returned home to Nova Scotia, wanting to take up his brother’s place in the military, and he enlisted immediately. By this point in the war, the Canadian Expeditionary Force's standards for dental health had been lowered; although Bird was required to have some teeth removed in Britain before being sent to the front in France. He served in France and Belgium at the front for two years with the Canadian Expeditionary Forces (42nd Battalion, Black Watch of Canada). His time in the war impacted his life as a writer as his war experiences were constantly a part of his stories. One of his finest works, And We Go On (1930) documents his time in France.

2500|$|Most of the post-electoral {{controversy}} {{revolved around}} Gore's request for <b>hand</b> <b>recounts</b> in four counties (Broward, Miami Dade, Palm Beach, and Volusia), as provided under Florida state law. Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris (also the co-chair of George W. Bush's election efforts in Florida) announced she would reject any revised totals from those counties {{if they were}} not turned in by 5:00p.m. on November 14, the statutory deadline for amended returns. The Florida Supreme Court extended the deadline to November 26, a decision later vacated by the U.S. Supreme Court. Miami-Dade eventually halted its recount and resubmitted its original total to the state canvassing board, while Palm Beach County failed to meet the extended deadline, turning in its completed recount results at 7:00p.m., which Harris indeed rejected. On November 26, the state canvassing board certified Bush the winner of Florida's electors by 537 votes. Gore formally contested the certified results. A state court decision overruling Gore was reversed by the Florida Supreme Court, which ordered a recount of over 70,000 ballots previously rejected as undervotes by machine counters. The U.S. Supreme Court halted that order the next day, with Justice Scalia issuing a concurring opinion that [...] "the counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten irreparable harm to petitioner" [...] (Bush).|$|R

His first run for the Governor's mansion in the 2004 election became the closest gubernatorial race in U.S. history; Rossi was certified as Governor-elect before losing a <b>hand</b> <b>recount</b> to Democrat Christine Gregoire.

It turned out, however, to be a race that {{went down to the}} wire, remaining too close to call throughout election night, and automatically triggering a two-month-long <b>hand</b> <b>recount.</b> Ultimately, Edwards prevailed, defeating Bruebaker by a mere 470 votes statewide, 152,071 to 151,601.|$|E
50|$|Controversy {{over the}} election's outcome {{continued}} after the certification of the <b>hand</b> <b>recount</b> results. The Washington State Republican Party {{called into question}} {{the discrepancy between the}} list of voters casting ballots in King County (895,660) and the number of ballots reported in the final <b>hand</b> <b>recount</b> (899,199). They claimed that hundreds of votes, including votes by felons, deceased voters, and double voters, were included in the canvass. As an explanation, election officials claimed that they had yet to finalize the list at the time, and argued that discrepancies in the two numbers are common and do not necessarily indicate fraud. As the election officials had expected, once the two lists were completed on January 5, the two numbers were indeed very close to one another. Also on January 5, 2005, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer published an article investigating votes in King County apparently cast by dead people. The PI uncovered eight cases of votes attributed to dead people; these included one administrative error, two ballots cast by the spouses of recently deceased voters (one who voted against Gregoire), one case of a husband apparently voting his dead wife's ballot instead of his own, and a man who legally voted his absentee ballot and then died before election day. One dead woman was marked as having voted in person at the polls.|$|E
