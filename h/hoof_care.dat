5|$|Horses require routine <b>hoof</b> <b>care</b> from a farrier, {{as well as}} vaccinations {{to protect}} against various diseases, and dental {{examinations}} from a veterinarian or a specialized equine dentist. If horses are kept inside in a barn, they require regular daily exercise for their physical health and mental well-being. When turned outside, they require well-maintained, sturdy fences to be safely contained. Regular grooming {{is also helpful to}} help the horse maintain good health of the hair coat and underlying skin.|$|E

5|$|Reproduction in most strepsirrhine species {{tends to}} be seasonal, {{particularly}} in lemurs. Key factors that affect seasonal reproduction include {{the length of the}} wet season, subsequent food availability, and the maturation time of the species. Like other primates, strepsirrhines are relatively slow breeders compared to other mammals. Their gestation period and interbirth intervals are usually long, and the young develop slowly, just like in haplorhine primates. Unlike simians, some strepsirrhines produce two or three offspring, although some produce only a single offspring. Those that produce multiple offspring tend to build nests for their young. These two traits are thought to be plesiomorphic (ancestral) for primates. The young are precocial (relatively mature and mobile) at birth, but not as coordinated as ungulates (<b>hoofed</b> mammals). Infant <b>care</b> by the mother is relatively prolonged compared to many other mammals, and in some cases, the infants cling to the mother's fur with their hands and feet.|$|R
40|$|Every year, {{the horse}} {{industry}} in Sweden is growing. Because of this growth, {{it would be}} most beneficial for {{the people involved in}} the agricultural business in Sweden to improve their horse skills. I have assembled a form that includes basic guidelines for professional horse care. History tells us that Swedish horses have had a huge impact on the agricultural business. Before the arrival of the tractor, the horse played a very important role for the farmer. Today, horses are kept primarily for pleasure, mostly as a hobby for non-professional people. In Sweden, we are seeing the small horse farms become more and more popular, which is keeping the countryside open and alive. I feel {{it is very important to}} improve the knowledge among farmers and others who will work in close proximity to horses. This will enable us to raise the standard of care of horses today and reduce the number of people who market themselves as professional horse specialists, even though they have no education or experience in the field In this essay you will find information about the most common horse breeds in Sweden, including basic anatomy of the horse, feeding directions, <b>hoof</b> and dental <b>care,</b> common diseases and their treatment. There is information relative to the safe transportation of a horse as well as the rules pertaining to horses in traffic. I have also provided a summary of the rules from the Swedish Department of Agriculture, not only regarding horses and how to keep them, but also compared these rules to the restrictions for cows and pigs. My hope is that this written work will give students of agriculture an easy but comprehensive overview, with basic guidelines to follow in their future involvement with the Swedish horse business. ...|$|R
25|$|The mane {{and tail}} of the Mongol horse are very long. Their strands are often used for {{braiding}} ropes; the tail hair {{can be used for}} violin bows. Mongolian horses have great stamina; although they have small bodies, they can gallop for 10km without a break. When pulling a cart, a team of four Mongol horses can draw a load of 4400lbs for 50â€“60km a day. Because the horses are allowed to live much the same as wild horses, they require {{little in the way of}} <b>hoof</b> <b>care.</b> The hooves are left untrimmed and unshod, and few farriers are in the country. Mongol horses have hard, strong hooves and seldom have foot problems. Sometimes, horses will be branded.|$|E
2500|$|Horses with navicular {{syndrome}} need a {{less intense}} work schedule. Their fitness {{can be maintained}} through slow long-distance work or swimming, {{as opposed to being}} worked at high speeds, up steep hills, or on hard surfaces, irregular terrain, or deep footing. Reducing the frequency of jumping is also important. [...] Some veterinarians and <b>hoof</b> <b>care</b> practitioners recommend exercising the horse on varied terrain to stimulate and strengthen the caudal hoof structures.|$|E
2500|$|The {{issue of}} <b>hoof</b> <b>care</b> {{is a subject}} of great debate. Corrective shoeing can be {{beneficial}} to horses suffering from navicular disease, although sometimes the effects are only temporary. Others believe that removing the shoes altogether {{is the best way}} to manage this disease, as it allows increased circulation to the hoof. [...] People on both sides agree that proper hoof shape and angle are an important long-term management plan for a horse with navicular disease. [...] As with laminitis, different horses may respond in different ways to a given technique, so the farrier, owner, and veterinarian should work as a team to formulate a plan and to adapt if the initial plan is not effective.|$|E
2500|$|Cattle {{are often}} raised by {{allowing}} herds to graze on the grasses of {{large tracts of}} rangeland. Raising cattle in this manner allows the use of land that might be unsuitable for growing crops. The most common interactions with cattle involve daily feeding, cleaning and milking. Many routine husbandry practices involve ear tagging, dehorning, loading, medical operations, vaccinations and <b>hoof</b> <b>care,</b> as well as training for agricultural shows and preparations. Also, some cultural differences occur in working with cattle; the cattle husbandry of Fulani men rests on behavioural techniques, whereas in Europe, cattle are controlled primarily by physical means, such as fences. [...] Breeders use cattle husbandry to reduce M. bovis infection susceptibility by selective breeding and maintaining herd health to avoid concurrent disease.|$|E
2500|$|Horses and ponies require routine <b>hoof</b> <b>care</b> by a {{professional}} farrier on average every six to eight weeks, depending on the animal, the work it performs and, in some areas, climate conditions. Hooves usually grow faster {{in the spring and}} fall than in summer or winter. They also appear to grow faster in warm, moist weather than in cold or dry weather. [...] In damp climates, the hooves tend to spread out more and wear down less than in dry climates, though more lush, growing forage may also be a factor. [...] Thus, a horse kept in a climate such as that of Ireland may need to have its feet trimmed more frequently than a horse kept in a drier climate such as Arizona, in the southwestern United States.|$|E

50|$|Jaime Jackson (born 1947) is a 35-year veteran <b>hoof</b> <b>care</b> professional, lecturer, {{author and}} {{researcher}} on wild and domestic horse hooves. He {{is best known}} for the practice of natural <b>hoof</b> <b>care</b> first written about in The Natural Horse: Lessons from the Wild (1992).|$|E
5000|$|The guiding {{principles}} to natural <b>hoof</b> <b>care,</b> according to Jackson, are: ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Jackson created the American Association of Natural <b>Hoof</b> <b>Care</b> Practitioners (AANHCP), a {{non-profit}} organization devoted to education, training and certification of the natural <b>hoof</b> <b>care</b> practitioner. Since then, the organization has expanded its scope and has {{changed its name to}} the Association for the Advancement of Natural Horse Care Practices. Jackson is its executive director.|$|E

50|$|Evidence {{show that}} risk factors favouring digital {{dermatitis}} outbreaks include: poor hygiene and high humidity; introduction of infected animals; no <b>hoof</b> <b>care</b> for heifers and dry cows; {{high levels of}} chronically infected animals; insufficient or inadequate hoof trimming; soft hooves and unbalanced nutrition.|$|E
50|$|AgroChem, Inc. is {{a privately}} owned {{manufacturing}} company located in Saratoga Springs, NY, {{that specializes in}} supplying chemicals and formulated products to dairy farms, including <b>hoof</b> <b>care</b> products, teat dips, and cleaning products. The company currently employs approximately 30 people and averages 10 - 20 million dollars in sales annually.|$|E
50|$|It is {{generally}} agreed upon by most natural <b>hoof</b> <b>care</b> practitioners that {{the management of}} the animal (diet and boarding conditions) are the most important components for the success of the horse to be barefoot. If the diet is unnatural, there will be inflammation and the horse cannot be comfortable.|$|E
50|$|Safe Haven {{also runs}} a {{programme}} of free veterinary clinics for working donkeys, mules and horses {{on both sides}} of the Palestinian border.

50|$|A farrier is {{specialist}} {{in care of}} horse's hooves. It is a specialize science that is part blacksmith and part veterinarian. Programs include <b>hoof</b> <b>care</b> as well as blacksmithing. The program was phased out by 2008 and is not currently offered. No information is available on when or if it will return.|$|E
5000|$|Natural <b>hoof</b> <b>care</b> is the {{practice}} of keeping horses so that their hooves are worn down naturally and so do not suffer overgrowth, splitting and other disorders. [...] Horseshoes are not used but domesticated horses may still require trimming, exercise and other measures to maintain a natural shape and degree of wear.|$|E
50|$|Critics of Dr. Strasser's {{method of}} <b>hoof</b> <b>care</b> allege that her {{methodology}} {{may result in}} lameness, pain and discomfort. She herself outlines circumstances where her extreme trim {{could result in the}} death of the horse under some circumstances. For this reason, many mainstream practitioners hesitate to recommend the more extreme aspects of Strasser's methods.|$|E
50|$|A farrier is a {{specialist}} in equine <b>hoof</b> <b>care,</b> including the trimming and balancing of horses' hooves and the placing of shoes on their hooves, if necessary. A farrier combines some blacksmith's skills (fabricating, adapting, and adjusting metal shoes) with some veterinarian's skills (knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the lower limb) to care for horses' feet.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hoof</b> <b>care</b> is {{especially}} important when caring for the horse. Although many horses are quite healthy without daily brushing, lack of hoofcare can result in various problems, which if unattended, can result in short or long-term soundness issues for the horse. Hooves need to be trimmed after four to ten weeks otherwise, they will grow too long and cause discomfort.|$|E
50|$|Genetic {{predisposition}} may {{be confirmed}} through a DNA test.There is no treatment as such, owners can attempt {{to manage the}} condition though various types of <b>hoof</b> <b>care,</b> and/or the use of special shoes. Such treatment is expensive and labour-intensive. Environmental conditions can make the condition worse (alternating wet/dry hooves). Protecting the hooves from such variations may reduce {{the effect of the}} disease.|$|E

50|$|Pine tar {{is widely}} used as a {{veterinary}} care product. It is a traditional antiseptic and <b>hoof</b> <b>care</b> product for horses and cattle. Pine tar has been used when chickens start pecking the low hen. Applying a smear of pine tar on the wound gives the attacking hens something else to do, as they are distracted by the effort {{of trying to get}} the sticky pine tar off their beaks.|$|E

50|$|Within {{the natural}} <b>hoof</b> <b>care</b> philosophy, the term barefoot horses refers to horses which are kept barefoot full-time, {{as opposed to}} horses who are fitted with horseshoes. The hooves of barefoot horses are trimmed with special {{consideration}} to a barefoot lifestyle. The barefoot horse movement advocates a generalized use of barefoot horses, both in non-competitive and competitive riding, often coupled with a more natural approach to horse care. Horses are kept barefoot {{in many parts of}} the world, including South America, Mongolia and other industrialized and non-industrialized cultures.|$|E
50|$|Cattle {{are often}} raised by {{allowing}} herds to graze on the grasses of {{large tracts of}} rangeland called ranches. Raising cattle in this manner allows the productive use of land that might be unsuitable for growing crops. The most common interactions with cattle involve daily feeding, cleaning and milking. Many routine husbandry practices involve ear tagging, dehorning, loading, medical operations, vaccinations and <b>hoof</b> <b>care,</b> as well as training for agricultural shows and preparations. There are also some cultural differences in working with cattle - the cattle husbandry of Fulani men rests on behavioural techniques, whereas in Europe cattle are controlled primarily by physical means like fences.|$|E
5000|$|Hooves grow {{continuously}}. In nature, {{wild animals}} {{are capable of}} wearing down the hoof as it continuously grows, but domesticated species often must undergo specific <b>hoof</b> <b>care</b> for a healthy, functional hoof. Proper care improves biomechanical efficiency and prevents lameness. [...] If not worn down by use, such as in systems like the dairy, ovine and equine industries, hooves {{may need to be}} trimmed by a farrier. Appropriate hoof trimming is essential to prevent lameness. Within the equine world, the expression, [...] "no foot, no horse" [...] emphasizes the importance of hoof health. Lameness, behind infertility and mastitis, is the biggest cause of economic loss to a dairy farmer.|$|E
50|$|The International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) now prohibits certain {{specific}} training methods, including poling and Rollkur, as have several countries, notably Switzerland. Many nations have passed assorted laws to protect horses from practices that include tail docking, transportation for excessive lengths of time, and artificial aids in horse racing or other equestrian competitions {{are subject to}} bans or national or European limitations. Transportation to slaughterhouses is regulated. In the context of increased research on equine welfare, new practices such as natural horsemanship, barefoot <b>hoof</b> <b>care,</b> and even refusal of riding have developed. These suggest a major concern {{for the welfare of}} the horse will continue into the future.|$|E
50|$|Natural horse {{boarding}} {{is unlike}} a traditional situation with stalls, small paddocks and/or lush green pastures ("founder traps"). It {{is designed to}} encourage movement {{through the creation of}} a series of paths with a quantity of various stimuli such as strategically placed feeding spots and watering holes that are incorporated within or alongside the track in order to activate curiosity or movement. Natural horse care practices include elements of natural <b>hoof</b> <b>care,</b> encouraging herd mentality, foraging for small amounts of food strategically available throughout the day, maintaining a watering hole near or at the source of drinking water, and behaviors related to horses as prey animals, relative dominance (pecking order), grooming, resting and sleeping behaviors.|$|E
