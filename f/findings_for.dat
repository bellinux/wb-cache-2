5|$|Main and Hesse {{found that}} most of the mothers of these {{children}} had suffered major losses or other trauma shortly before or after the birth of the infant and had reacted by becoming severely depressed. In fact, 56% of mothers who had lost a parent by death before they completed high school subsequently had children with disorganized attachments. Subsequent studies, whilst emphasising the potential importance of unresolved loss, have qualified these <b>findings.</b> <b>For</b> example, Solomon and George found that unresolved loss in the mother tended to be associated with disorganized attachment in their infant primarily when they had also experienced an unresolved trauma in their life prior to the loss.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{designed}} {{a new type}} balloon vessel based on Carlotta's discoveries of aerodynamics and how airship bodies acted in the sky. Carlotta {{was the first woman}} to use a maneuverable airship. She used a cloth screw-sail and also a cloth rudder for controlling the steering of her aeroplane platform. The platform car device weighted 11 pounds. This {{was the first time that}} an ordinary spherical balloon could be controlled by a person. Myers then incorporated new features into balloons based on Carlotta's <b>findings.</b> <b>For</b> a more efficient steerable airship vessel he made his next balloon gas bag bottom flat so that it would act like an inclined plane.|$|E
5|$|On 28 May 2009, Yuri Savenko {{wrote to}} the then President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev an open letter, in which Savenko asked Medvedev {{to submit to the}} State Duma a draft law {{prepared}} by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia to address the sharp drop in the level of forensic psychiatric examinations, which Savenko attributed to the lack of competition within the sector and its increasing nationalization. The open letter says that the level of the expert reports has dropped {{to such an extent that}} it is often a matter of not only the absence of entire sections of the report, even such as the substantiation of its findings, and not only the gross contradiction of its findings to the descriptive section of the report, but it is often a matter of concrete statements which are so contrary to generally accepted scientific terms that doubts about the disinterestedness of the experts arise. According to the letter, courts, in violation of procedural rules, do not analyze the expert report, its coherence and consistency in all its parts, do not check experts' <b>findings</b> <b>for</b> their accuracy, completeness, and objectivity.|$|E

25|$|The idea of {{the social}} sharing of emotion derived from studies about {{emotional}} trauma. These studies show that after natural disasters, catastrophes, or life-change events people {{have a tendency to}} talk about their experiences and disclose their feelings and emotions.

Other studies produced similar <b>findings</b> <b>for</b> people who experienced natural disasters and for cancer patients. Rimé later proposed the term “social sharing of emotions” to describe this phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|Different {{fields in}} {{epidemiology}} have {{different levels of}} validity. One way to assess the validity of findings is the ratio of false-positives (claimed effects that are not correct) to false-negatives (studies which fail to support a true effect). To take the field of genetic epidemiology, candidate-gene studies produced over 100 false-positive <b>findings</b> <b>for</b> each false-negative. By contrast genome-wide association appear close to the reverse, with only one false positive for every 100 or more false-negatives. This ratio has improved over time in genetic epidemiology as the field has adopted stringent criteria. By contrast other epidemiological fields have not required such rigorous reporting and are much less reliable as a result.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} similar <b>findings</b> <b>for</b> India.

Workers in the textile industry, for example, earned more in Bengal and Mysore {{than they did in}} Britain, while agricultural labour in Britain had to work longer hours to earn the same amount as in Mysore. In the late 18th century, Mysore's average per-capita income was five times higher than subsistence level, i.e. five times higher than $400 (1990 international dollars), or $2,000 per capita. In comparison, the highest national per-capita incomes in 1820 were $1,838 for the Netherlands and $1,706 for Britain.|$|E

25|$|The {{project has}} used crowd-sourcing to create maps which show where sexual assault has taken place. In 2012, Women Under Siege {{put out a}} call to people from Syria and those working with Syrian {{refugees}} {{to provide information about}} rape and sexual assault. The entries were created by collecting information from journalists, human rights activists and individual citizens. Some the reports came via email or by Twitter with the hashtag #RapeinSyria. Women Under Siege mapped these incidents, providing over 117 pieces of data for each entry. The data was documented in real time, using a software developed by Ushahidi. The data was analyzed and put together in a comprehensive report that details a huge amount of human suffering. Not only did the information shine a light on the problem, it also uncovered unexpected <b>findings.</b> <b>For</b> example, the data revealed that Syrian government forces were also largely responsible for much of the sexual violence.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} a study by Deborah Tolman and her colleagues {{indicated}} that adolescent exposure to sexuality on television in general does not directly affect their sexual behaviors, rather it {{is the type of}} message they view that has the most impact. Gender stereotypes enacted in sexual scenes on TV were seen to have a large affect on adolescents. Girls felt they had less control over their sexuality when they saw men objectifying women and not valuing commitment. The study discussed the risk of women internalizing this message and spreading the idea that it is okay to be weak and answer to men all the time. However, girls who saw women on TV who refuted men’s sexual advances usually felt more comfortable talking about their own sexual needs in their sexual experiences as well as standing up for themselves. They were comfortable setting sexual limits and therefore held more control over their sexuality. <b>Findings</b> <b>for</b> boys were less clear; those who saw dominant and aggressive men actually had less sexual experiences.|$|E
