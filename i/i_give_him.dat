About filming with Ryan Reynolds, Morrison commented, [...] "We did the whole scene together where <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> the ring, our suits are CGI so we had these grey suits with things on them so it was cool and working with Martin Campbell again was great too".|$|E
500|$|Khan's {{pursuit of}} Kirk {{is central to}} the film's theme of vengeance, and The Wrath of Khan {{deliberately}} borrows heavily from Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. To make the parallels clear to viewers, Meyer added a visible copy of Moby-Dick to Khan's dwelling. Khan liberally paraphrases Ahab, with [...] "I'll chase him round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition's flames before <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> up!". Khan also quotes Ahab's tirade {{at the end of the}} novel verbatim with his final lines: [...] "to the last I grapple with thee; from Hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's sake, I spit my last breath at thee." [...] Kirk represents both the restless elements of Ishmael as well as the titular white whale of Melville's novel; Khan's blind pursuit of Kirk mirrors Captain Ahab's obsession with Moby-Dick. Both Khan and Ahab pursue their quarry against the better judgment of their crew, and end up killing themselves in an effort to take their foe with them. University of Northern Colorado professor Jane Wall Hinds argues that the themes of The Wrath of Khan clash with the optimistic and transcendentalist perspectives of the original series and [...] Moby Dicks themes of vengeance would later heavily influence [...]|$|E

2500|$|In 1998, {{within two}} years of {{entering}} professional boxing, Mayweather decisively won his first world title (the WBC super featherweight (130lb) championship) with an eighth-round technical knockout of The Ring world #1-ranked super featherweight Genaro Hernández after his opponent's cornerman stopped the fight. It was Hernández' first defeat in that weight class; he said after the fight, [...] "He defeated me, he is quick, smart and I always knew he had the speed. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> respect.

2500|$|Keiichi Ito, the {{director-general}} {{for training}} of the Japan Self-Defense Forces, said that Maeno's act was tainted by self-serving motives, not in self-sacrifice for the country. Ito, who was a surviving member of the tokkōtai, or kamikaze units, said [...] "Maeno was performing an egotistical, grandstand play to win publicity, not unlike Mishima's suicide. Both were showing off to the world." [...] Nevertheless, Ito commended Maeno's technique in the attack.

[...] While meeting with Stalin and Roosevelt in Tehran in 1943, Churchill stated that Britain was vitally interested in restoring Poland as an independent country. Britain did not press the matter for fear that it would become a source of inter-allied friction.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 August 2016, Bordeaux and Milan {{reached an}} {{agreement}} for the transfer of Ménez. On 3 August, two days after signing for the club, {{he was involved in}} a gruesome incident in a pre-season match against Lorient. The injury occurred in the second-half when Lorient midfielder Didier Ndong inadvertently stood on Ménez's head, causing the former French international to lose part of his right ear in the process. Ménez had only come on as a substitute in the 62nd minute but had to be taken off a little more than 15 minutes later when the incident happened. Ndong offered his apologies to Ménez for his part in the accident, stating, [...] "I offer my apologies to Jeremy Ménez and Girondins de Bordeaux. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> my full support for the coming days and hope to see him very quickly on the pitches of Ligue 1." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....think of the {{following}} use of language: I send someone shopping. <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a slip marked 'five red apples'. He takes the slip to the shopkeeper, who opens the drawer marked 'apples', then he looks up the word 'red' in a table and finds a colour sample opposite it; then he says the series of cardinal numbers—I assume that he knows them by heart—up to the word 'five' and for each number he takes an apple of the same colour as the sample out of the drawer.—It is in this and similar ways that one operates with words—"But how does he know where and how he is to look up the word 'red' and what he is {{to do with the}} word 'five'?" [...] Well, I assume that he acts as I have described. Explanations come to an end somewhere.—But what is {{the meaning of the word}} 'five'? No such thing was in question here, only how the word 'five' is used.|$|E

2500|$|In 1979, Teresa {{received}} the Nobel Peace Prize [...] "for work {{undertaken in the}} struggle to overcome poverty and distress, which also constitutes a threat to peace". She refused the conventional ceremonial banquet for laureates, asking that its $192,000 cost be given to the poor in India and saying that earthly rewards were important only if they helped her to help the world's needy. When Teresa {{received the}} prize she was asked, [...] "What can we do to promote world peace?" [...] She answered, [...] "Go home and love your family." [...] Building on this theme in her Nobel lecture, she said: [...] "Around the world, not only in the poor countries, but I found the poverty of the West so much more difficult to remove. When I pick up a person from the street, hungry, <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a plate of rice, a piece of bread, I have satisfied. I have removed that hunger. But a person that is shut out, that feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, the person that has been thrown out from society—that poverty is so hurtable [...] and so much, and I find that very difficult." [...] Teresa singled out abortion as [...] "the greatest destroyer of peace today. Because if a mother can kill her own child—what is left for me to kill you and you kill me—there is nothing between." ...|$|E
