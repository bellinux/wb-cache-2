25|$|After {{the release}} of Backstabber Etiquette, more touring ensued. This proved to be too {{demanding}} for guitarist Tim Audette. Tim parted ways with the band in June 2003 following a Maritime tour. The band continued as a three-piece and recorded {{a series of three}} splits with <b>Feeble</b> <b>Minded,</b> Sergent Slaughter and Subcut respectively. While recording the material for these splits, guitarist Dave Menard joined the band and brought new inspiration. However, the split with Subcut would be the last recording with drummer Matt Connell who felt it was time to part ways with the band.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of 2006, Tim Olsen was asked to leave the band. Mathieu Vilandré, who had {{previously}} filled in on drums, took over the position permanently and recording began for the next full-length album in February. Early in the recording process, the band was contacted by Relapse Records and secured a three-album deal with them that would start with their next album. In the interim, the Collection of Splits 2002-2004 was released by Great White North Records which exposed fans {{to some of the}} band's music that was more difficult to acquire due to limited pressings. It included all of the material from the splits released between Backstabber Etiquette and Legacy of Hopelessness (with Subcut, Sergent Slaughter, <b>Feeble</b> <b>Minded</b> and Sylvester Staline) as well as enhanced MP3 tracks from some earlier splits.|$|E

2500|$|Second, {{the most}} linguistically sound {{etymology}} is that baka derives from a Sanskrit word meaning [...] "fool". According to the Japanese linguist and lexicographer Shinmura Izuru, the Edo Period scholar Amano Sadakage 天野信景 (1663–1733) originally suggested that Japanese Buddhist priests coined the word baka [...] "fool" [...] from Sanskrit. Modern reference works give two possible Sanskrit {{sources for the}} word, moha [...] (transcribed 慕何) [...] "foolish" [...] and mahallaka (摩訶羅) [...] "stupid". Sanskrit moha [...] means [...] "bewilderment, loss of consciousness, delusion, folly" [...] and comes from the root muh [...] "bewildered, perplexed, confused". Sanskrit mahallaka means [...] "senile, <b>feeble</b> <b>minded,</b> stupid, decrepit" [...] and comes from mūrkha [...] "dull, stupid, foolish, inexperienced; fool".|$|E
2500|$|From his {{writings}} collected as The Hindu View of Life, Upton Lectures, Delivered at Manchester College, Oxford, 1926: [...] "Hinduism insists on our working steadily upwards in improving {{our knowledge of}} God. The worshippers of the absolute are of the highest rank; second to them are the worshippers of the personal God; then come the worshippers of the incarnations of Rama, Krishna, Buddha; below them are those who worship deities, ancestors, and sages, and lowest of all are the worshippers of petty forces and spirits. The deities of some men are in water (i.e., bathing places), those of the most advanced are in the heavens, those of the children (in religion) are in the images of wood and stone, but the sage finds his God in his deeper self. The man of action finds his God in fire, the man of feeling in the heart, and the <b>feeble</b> <b>minded</b> in the idol, but the strong in spirit find God everywhere". The seers see the supreme in the self, and not the images." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the Pisgah Home {{movement}} became successful, Yoakum built other facilities. Pisgah Ark {{was built}} in Arroyo Seco where [...] "wayward girls" [...] and prostitutes were sheltered and taught midwifery {{under the direction of}} Sister Nell. [...] Pisgah Gardens {{was built in}} North Hollywood, where beds were maintained for 100 patients suffering from tuberculosis, cancer and mental disorders. [...] Yoakum also built the Pisgah Store in Arroyo Seco where donated clothing and other goods were distributed free of charge. [...] There was also a gospel mission in West Los Angeles. [...] In the late 1910s, a local newspaper described the breadth of services provided by Pisgah Home:"Its door is ever open any hour, day or night, to receive the poor, needy, homeless, the drunkard, fallen, or outcast. [...] Across the Arroyo, the 'Ark' makes a home for rescued women and girls. [...] Nearby is the 'Workers' Home,' and the 'Store,' over whose counter no money has ever passed in the five years of its existence. [...] Voluntary contributions keep its supply ever ready for the needs of the many people who apply. [...] Eighteen or twenty miles (32 km) away are the 'Gardens,' [...] of fruit, vegetable and farm land near Lankershim, with [...] under cultivation. [...] Here a hundred more are gathered, a colony of consumptives fighting their way back to health, a group of epileptics and <b>feeble</b> <b>minded,</b> and an orphanage for 'nameless' and homeless children. [...] Apricot, plum and peach trees furnish fruit which is dried by the ton, and cannery preserves much of the fruit which, together with other products, is distributed to the poor, 'without money and without price.'"By 1914, Pisgah Home had outgrown its facilities, and Yoakum bought a 3,300 ranch in the Santa Susana Mountains north of Simi Valley, California. [...] Yoakum paid $50,000 for the property, and there he built Pisgah Grande, a residential and religious utopian community that has since been reclaimed by nature.|$|E

50|$|First illness as bishopOn Easter Tuesday, April 3, 1866, Kerfoot {{participated in}} the service at Trinity Church by reading the ante-Communion. After that, {{he met with the}} Board of Diocesan Missions from 10:45 until 1:30. During the last half hour, he began to feel weak and bewildered, as he later wrote, very weak. He said that he “broke down utterly; body <b>feeble,</b> <b>mind</b> and memory confused,” so he had to stop work and cancel a visit to Meadville. By the next day, Kerfoot was still “very weak, but better.” He blamed his illness on “nervous prostration from Hospital fever, the hot weather, and overwork.” By April 16, he was much better and began to resume his work.|$|R

The Earl was a well built, handsome man, fair complexioned, with a considerable profusion of light coloured hair, and bright blue eyes, which gleamed {{like those of a}} falcon.

60|$|Fear, {{as much as}} calculation, had induced Hetty {{to cease}} paddling, when she found that her pursuers did not know in which {{direction}} to proceed. She remained stationary until the Ark had pulled in near the encampment, as has been related in the preceding chapter, when she resumed the paddle and with cautious strokes made the best of her way towards the western shore. In order to avoid her pursuers, however, who, she rightly suspected, would soon be rowing along that shore themselves, {{the head of the}} canoe was pointed so far north as to bring her to land on a point that thrust itself into the lake, at the distance of near a league from the outlet. Nor was this altogether the result of a desire to escape, for, <b>feeble</b> <b>minded</b> as she was, Hetty Hutter had a good deal of that instinctive caution which so often keeps those whom God has thus visited from harm. She was perfectly {{aware of the importance of}} keeping the canoes from falling into the hands of the Iroquois, and long familiarity with the lake had suggested one of the simplest expedients, by which this great object could be rendered compatible with her own purpose.|$|E
