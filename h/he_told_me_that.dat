25|$|When the old gentleman {{asked if}} he could be helped for his fear of riding in an elevator, I told him I could {{probably}} scare the pants off him in another direction. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> nothing could be worse than his fear of an elevator.|$|E
25|$|I {{went to see}} Professor Douglas Hartree, who {{had built}} the first {{differential}} analyzers in England and had more experience in using these very specialized computers than anyone else. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> in his opinion, all the calculations that would ever be needed in this country could {{be done on the}} three digital computers which were then being built—one in Cambridge, one in Teddington, and one in Manchester. No one else, he said, would ever need machines of their own, or would be able to afford to buy them.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, [...] {{with the}} {{primitive}} facilities {{available at the}} time, Ulam and von Neumann did carry out numerical computations {{that led to a}} satisfactory design. This motivated their advocacy of a powerful computational capability at Los Alamos, which began during the war years, continued through the cold war, and still exists. Otto Frisch remembered Ulam as [...] "a brilliant Polish topologist with a charming French wife. At once <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he was a pure mathematician who had sunk so low that his latest paper actually contained numbers with decimal points!" ...|$|E

500|$|... "It's {{obvious that}} the reason he made that choice was financial. The {{chairman}} [...] authorised me to open a legal action at the Justice Ministry requesting that he loses his Brazilian citizenship, which Diego Costa has rejected... The chairman told me that Costa has proved he's not fit {{to be part of}} the Scolari family, that he would contaminate the family because he's not committed to Brazil, but to Spain. He rejected his Brazilian citizenship. Marin has asked me to study the situation deeply in order to keep him from ever playing for Spain. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> from now on, Costa is 'persona non grata' at the national team and that the players themselves wouldn't welcome him because of that episode".|$|E
2500|$|After his death, Powell's friend Richard Ritchie {{recorded}} in 1998 that [...] "during {{one of the}} habitual coal crises of recent years <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he had no objection to supporting the coal industry, either through the restriction of cheap coal imports or subsidy, {{if it were the}} country's wish to preserve local coal communities".|$|E
2500|$|French {{has claimed}} that her {{self-confidence}} and self-belief stem from her father, {{who told her}} how beautiful she was each day. She stated, [...] "He taught me to value myself. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I was beautiful and the most precious thing in his life." [...] He {{had a history of}} severe depression and attempted suicides but managed to conceal his illness from Dawn and her brother.|$|E

The cap'n was dressed up in 'is Sunday clothes, {{with one of the}} cleanest collars on I 'ave ever seen in my life, and smoking a cigar that smelt like an escape of gas. He came back alone at ha'past eleven <b>that</b> night, and <b>'e</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> if it wasn't for the other one down Shoremouth way he should be the 'appiest man on earth.|$|R
6000|$|She paused, and recollected. [...] "Yes, Sir," [...] she said, [...] "I {{am afraid}} he did; <b>he</b> flatly <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not touched the baby-house." ...|$|R

2500|$|By age 16, Cabral {{was already}} on track to {{finishing}} high school early; after graduation, she intended to find a full-time job to help her parents financially. [...] Her math teacher, Philip Lamm, convinced her instead to consider higher education. [...] Lamm, she recalled in a later interview, [...] "hand wrote the application. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> this was a better plan and found scholarship money {{for me to go}} to college." [...] Lamm also helped her overcome her family's initial misgivings.|$|E
2500|$|Driven by an unswerving {{belief in}} his abilities, Romário's laid back manner and {{overwhelming}} self-confidence would be displayed throughout his career, with Guus Hiddink, his coach at PSV, stating, “If {{he saw that}} I was a bit more nervous than usual ahead of a big game, he’d {{come to me and}} say: ‘Take it easy, coach, I’m going to score and we’re going to win'. What’s incredible is that eight out of the ten times <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> he really did score and we really did win.” ...|$|E
2500|$|According {{to former}} President Jimmy Carter, several weeks {{following}} his retirement, Rickover [...] "was {{invited to the}} Oval Office and decided to don his full dress uniform. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he refused to take a seat, listened to the president ask him to be his special nuclear advisor, replied 'Mr. President, that is bullshit,' and then walked out." [...] The Navy's official investigation of General Dynamics' Electric Boat division was ended shortly afterward. According to Theodore Rockwell, Rickover's Technical Director for more than 15 years, more than one source at that time stated that General Dynamics officials were bragging around Washington that they had [...] "gotten Rickover." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> nothing; <b>that's</b> how I knew it," [...] said Henrietta cleverly. [...] "He {{said very}} little about you, but I spoke of you a good deal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> himself, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would have}} taken flight at once and, in that case, his kingdom would have been lost; and he himself, sooner or later, hunted down." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although {{according}} to Charles Lyell, Cuvier made this statement after a late party and apparently had some doubts when reconsidering the matter when he awoke, fresh in the morning. [...] "The next morning <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{he was confident}} {{that it was something}} quite different." [...] Strangely, this change of opinion did not make it back to Britain where Mantell was mocked for his error. Mantell was still convinced that the teeth had come from the Mesozoic strata and finally recognised that they resembled those of the iguana, but were twenty times larger. He surmised that the owner of the remains must have been at least 60feet (18metres) in length.|$|E
2500|$|In 1933, Furtwängler {{met with}} Hitler {{to try to}} stop the new antisemitic policy in the domain of music. He had {{prepared}} a list of significant Jewish musicians: these included the composer Arnold Schoenberg, the musicologist Curt Sachs, the violinist Carl Flesch, and Jewish members of the Berlin Philharmonic. Hitler did not listen to Furtwängler, who lost patience, and the meeting became a shouting match. Berta Geissmar wrote, [...] "After the audience, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he knew now what was behind Hitler's narrow-minded measures. This is not only antisemitism, but the rejection of any form of artistic, philosophical thought, the rejection of any form of free culture..." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{his visit}} to Chile in 1987, John Paul II asked Chile's 31 Catholic bishops to {{campaign}} for free elections in the country. According to George Weigel and Cardinal Stanisław Dziwisz, he encouraged Pinochet to accept a democratic opening of the regime, and may even have called for his resignation According to Monsignor Sławomir Oder, the postulator of John Paul II's beatification cause, John Paul's words to Pinochet {{had a profound impact}} on the Chilean dictator. The pope confided to a friend: [...] "I received a letter from Pinochet in which <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> as a Catholic he had listened to my words, he had accepted them, and he had decided to begin the process to change the leadership of his country." ...|$|E

2500|$|Razzak was {{the only}} Bangladeshi {{to play in the}} 2008 Indian Premier League making him the first Bangladeshi to play the league. He was bought for $50,000 by the Royal Challengers Bangalore and played in only one match. Despite not playing often for the team, Razzak {{believed}} that the experience he gained from the tournament was important. He stated that Anil Kumble [...] "was very helpful when I asked him about bowling in Test matches. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> given my bowling approach, {{it is very important to}} use variations within my line and length. Actually, captains would want a breakthrough from me so without using variations, wickets are hard to come by. Coach Venkatesh Prasad was also a great help".|$|E
2500|$|... "A Syrian {{brought him}} to see me - can't even {{remember}} his name. Khalil always said I was his first friend in New York. We became very, very great friends, {{and all of his}} books - The Madman, The Forerunner, The Son of Man, The Prophet - I heard in manuscript. He always gave me his books. I liked The Prophet best. I don't believe that there was any connection between `Abdu'l-Bahá and The Prophet. But <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he thought of the `Abdu'l-Bahá all through. He said {{that he was going to}} write another book with '`Abdu'l-Bahá as the center and all the contemporaries of '`Abdu'l-Bahá speaking. He died before he wrote it. He told me definitely that [...] The Son of Man was influenced by '`Abdu'l-Bahá." ...|$|E
2500|$|Graham {{always told}} me right early on {{that he would never}} get married. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> his life was devastated when his parents split up, and he said {{straight}} out, [...] "Mrs Fox, I'll never get married", so I never expected anything more of him than what did happen. Even when Lana Cantrell came into the scene I was puzzled and I did say to him why all this, and of course we all know it was good publicity. Lana came to the house and I had to go up, and have it all cleaned, ready for her and her party to come one Sunday night. And then on the Monday night, this great big announcement was going to be made that {{he was supposed to be}} engaged to Lana Cantrell. Well, the ratings went through the roof...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about <b>that,</b> too. They {{were going}} to swindle some folks, and Abe heard about it and gave the thing away. Abe won't stand for {{anything}} that ain't strictly honest." ...|$|R

2500|$|This {{confirmed}} Thérèse {{in her own}} intuitions. She wrote, [...] "My {{soul was}} like a book which the priest read better than I did. He launched me full sail on the waves of confidence and love which held such an attraction for me, but upon which I had not dared to venture. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> my faults did not offend God." [...] Her spiritual life drew {{more and more on}} the Gospels that she carried with her at all times. The piety of her time was fed more on commentaries, but Thérèse had asked Céline to get the Gospels and the Epistles of St Paul bound into a single small volume which she could carry on her heart. She said, [...] "But it is especially the Gospels which sustain me during my hours of prayer, for in them I find what is necessary for my poor little soul. I am constantly discovering in them new lights, hidden and mysterious meanings." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} alleged that Grace's illness {{developed}} [...] "after {{sleeping in a}} damp hotel bed". Gilbert, who stayed at the hotel for several days, later wrote to The Daily Telegraph: [...] "It having come to my knowledge there is a rumour abroad that Mr. G. F. Grace's fatal illness was caused by sleeping in a damp bed at the Red Lion Hotel, Basingstoke, I beg to contradict it. He had a bad cold before he left home, and on my arrival at Basingstoke <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> he had received another chill whilst waiting at Reading Station. By inserting this you will greatly oblige me, and also {{do justice to the}} members of a family whose attention and kindness to my cousin all through his illness could not have been surpassed had he been at home". The [...] "damp bed" [...] story is refuted by evidence to the contrary, as described above, because Grace's illness began with the cold he caught during the match at The Oval and he was already ill when he arrived in Basingstoke.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1904, KR became {{somewhat}} {{attached to}} an attractive young {{man by the name}} of Yatsko. [...] "I sent for Yatsko and he came this morning. I easily persuaded him to be candid. It was strange for me to hear him describe the familiar characteristics: he has never felt drawn to a woman, and has been infatuated with men several times. I did not confess to him that I knew these feelings from my own personal experience. Yatsko and I talked for a long time. Before leaving he kissed my face and hands; I should not have allowed this, and should have pushed him away, however I was punished afterwards by vague feelings of shame and remorse. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> ever since the first time we met, his soul has been filled with rapturous feelings towards me, which grow all the time. How this reminds me of my own youth." [...] A few days later, KR and Yatsko met again, and a relationship developed between the two.|$|E
