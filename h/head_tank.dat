Size {{of the power}} generated from the plant {{is affected by the}} capacity of the water in the <b>head</b> <b>tank.</b> <b>Head</b> <b>tank</b> served as a container of water in the reservoir end of the plant which supplies water to spin turbines rapidly through the penstock.

The purpose of this research is to design an automatic water level control system in order to fulfill the load on the generator using PID controller.

40|$|Various pumping {{arrangements}} and their pressure profile control for forced cooling of long pipe type transmission lines were investigated. In order {{to overcome the}} extensive friction head losses and provide ample cable cooling, a number of pump stations has to be used. Since the inner line segments cannot be provided with pressure control head tanks, line blockages, flow resistance changes, flow rate changes, pump shutdowns, or other imbalances in one segment can alter the pressure profile along the entire line, and, when two head tanks are used, create transverse flow. Using experimental and analytical methods, {{it was determined that}} the pump - relief valve combination operating as a constant flow source is superior to the pump - relief valve combination operating as a constant pressure source, and that the configuration consisting of an even number of loops, each loop having the opposite flow direction from its neighbor's, is the best solution when operated with only one pressure control <b>head</b> <b>tank.</b> The simplest, and yet effective, line pressure profile control appears to be the pump bypass, which could be easily implemented on existing installations. The <b>head</b> <b>tank</b> pressure adjustment, however, is the most effective line pressure profile control scheme, and should be considered when a new system is being designed. From the analysis performed on an electric analogy model it was found, that the <b>head</b> <b>tank</b> pressure adjustment or the pump bypass would be sufficient to mainain the line pressure profile within its working limits for all practical imbalance sizes, and that, to extend the range of either of these line pressure profile controls, the emergency pump shutdown and the pump bypass itself should be based on the pump discharge, rather than the pump inlet pressure.
