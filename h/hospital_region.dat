40|$|BACKGROUND: Risk {{factors for}} early {{mortality}} after pulmonary embolism (PE) are widely known. However, {{it is uncertain}} which factors are associated with early readmission after PE. We sought to identify predictors of readmission after an admission for PE. METHODS: We studied 14 426 patient discharges with a primary diagnosis of PE from 186 acute care hospitals in Pennsylvania from January 1, 2000, to November 30, 2002. The outcome was readmission within 30 days of presentation for PE. We used a discrete proportional odds model to study the association between time to readmission and patient factors (age, sex, race, insurance, discharge status, and severity of illness), thrombolysis, and hospital characteristics (region, teaching status, and number of beds). RESULTS: Overall, 2064 patient discharges (14. 3 %) resulted in a readmission within 30 days of presentation for PE. The most common reasons for readmission were venous thromboembolism (21. 9 %), cancer (10. 8 %), pneumonia (5. 2 %), and bleeding (5. 0 %). In multivariable analysis, African American race (odds ratio [OR], 1. 19; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 02 - 1. 38), Medicaid insurance (OR, 1. 54; 95 % CI, 1. 31 - 1. 81), discharge home with supplemental care (OR, 1. 40; 95 % CI, 1. 27 - 1. 54), leaving the hospital against medical advice (OR, 2. 84; 95 % CI, 1. 80 - 4. 48), and severity of illness were independently associated with readmission; readmission also varied by <b>hospital</b> <b>region.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Early readmission after PE is common. African American race, Medicaid insurance, severity of illness, discharge status, and <b>hospital</b> <b>region</b> are significantly associated with readmission. The high readmission rates for venous thromboembolism and bleeding suggest that readmission {{may be linked to}} suboptimal quality of care in the management of PE...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundThoracic endoluminal aortic {{aneurysm}} repair (TEVAR) {{is associated with}} improved outcomes compared with open thoracic {{aortic aneurysm}} repair. This {{study was designed to}} better characterize TEVAR outcomes in a large population, and to determine if outcomes are independently influenced by patient ethnicity and insurance status. MethodsUsing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, we selected patients who underwent TEVAR between 2001 and 2005. Ethnicity and insurance type were independently evaluated against the outcome variables of mortality and postoperative complications. Age, gender, <b>hospital</b> <b>region,</b> hospital location, hospital size, and comorbidities were controlled as cofounders. ResultsBetween 2001 and 2005, 875 patients underwent TEVAR. There was a significantly greater proportion of Caucasians (n = 650) compared with African Americans (n = 104) or Hispanics (n = 49). Patients had a male preponderance, and most procedures were elective. The overall mortality was 13. 3 % (n = 117), and spinal cord ischemia was 0. 8 % (n = 7), with no differences between patients of varied ethnicity or payer status. Significant differences were noted among the races including gender (P =. 003), income (P <. 0001), <b>hospital</b> <b>region</b> (P <. 001), hospital bed size (P =. 013), and insurance type (P <. 001). Significant variations in demographics characteristics were also present between patients with different insurance classifications including gender (P <. 001), surgery type (P =. 009), income (P =. 003), race (P <. 0001), and comorbidity index (P <. 0001). After adjustment for cofounders and multiple comparisons, there were no differences in rates of complications among patients with varying race or insurance status. ConclusionsMortality after TEVAR remains high in the US, although this may be associated with its early introduction during the study period. Nonetheless, the incidence of spinal cord ischemia is very low. Ethnicity and insurance type do not appear to influence TEVAR outcomes...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Accurate field triage of {{critically}} injured {{patients to}} trauma centers {{is vital for}} improving survival. We sought to estimate the national degree of undertriage of trauma patients who die in emergency departments (EDs) by evaluating the frequency and characteristics associated with triage to non-trauma centers. Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of adult ED trauma deaths in the 2010 National Emergency Department Sample (NEDS). The primary outcome was appropriate triage to a trauma center (Level I, II or III) or undertriage to a non-trauma center.

40|$|THE {{importance}} of distinguishing {{between the various}} histological types of lung cancer has been stressed in many epidemiological studies. It has been suggested for example that cigarette smoking is associated with squamous and anaplastic rather than with glandular celled tumours. There are not, however, any statistics available on a national basis which make this distinction. Under the Registrar General's National Cancer Registration Scheme (see, for example, Stocks, 1950) information is collected concerning a proportion of all cases of malignant disease diagnosed throughout England and Wales. This proportion {{was believed to be}} about 55 per cent in 1952 (Ministry of Health, 1956). Although histological descriptions are not reported, the existence of the scheme makes it possible to identify all cases of lung cancer recorded in the participating hospitals and thus to collect details of the histology and any other factors recorded locally. The original {{purpose of the present study}} was to identify all cases of lung cancer registered in the South Western <b>Hospital</b> <b>Region</b> of England during the 12 years 1945 - 56 for which a histological diagnosis had been made, and to determin...|$|E

40|$|Background: Hospitalized {{children}} receive care in {{a variety}} of settings. While there is ongoing research describing care in children 2 ̆ 7 s hospitals, the differences in resource utilization across hospitals types have not been well described. ^ Objective: The aims of our study were to describe where children receive care for common inpatient diagnoses and to examine the associated LOS and costs across hospital types that care for children. ^ Design/Methods: This was a cross sectional study of the 2012 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids 2 ̆ 7 Inpatient Database. We examined pediatric hospitalizations (0 - 18 years) with common acute care conditions. The main independent variable was hospital type: Children 2 ̆ 7 s Hospitals (CH), Non-children 2 ̆ 7 s teaching hospitals (NCT), Non-children 2 ̆ 7 s non-teaching hospitals (NCNT).

40|$|THE {{trace element}} content of soil samples taken from gardens of houses where a death had just {{occurred}} from cancer {{or some other}} cause was first investigated {{in the course of}} a comprehensive survey of cancer incidence in North Wales and Liverpool <b>Hospital</b> <b>Region</b> during 1952 - 55 (Stocks, 1957). In that and subsequent work the term " content " meant the amount of each element extractable from soil under certain strict conditions, namely the shaking of soil with N/ 2 acetic acid (2. 5 : 100 w/v) for one hour with a further standing contact for 15 hours. Within any area of similar climatic and pedological conditions these analytical figures will reflect the amounts of each element available for plant uptake from the soil solution.

We sought to examine the association between glucose levels and mortality and hospital readmission rates for patients with PE. RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODSdWe evaluated 13, 621 patient discharges with a primary diagnosis of PE from 185 acute care hospitals in Pennsylvania (from January 2000 to November 2002). Admission glucose levels were analyzed as a categorical variable (# 110,. 110 – 140,. 140 – 170,. 170 – 240, and. 240 mg/dL). The outcomes were 30 -day all-cause mortality and hospital readmission. We used random-intercept logistic regression to assess the independent association between admission glucose levels and mortality and hospital readmis-sion, adjusting for patient (age, sex, race, insurance, comorbid conditions, severity of illness, laboratory parameters, and thrombolysis) and <b>hospital</b> (<b>region,</b> size, and teaching status) factors.
