50|$|Surge {{relief valves}} {{are known for}} their quick speed of response, {{excellent}} flow characteristics, and durability in <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>applications.</b> Surge relief valves are designed to have an adjustable set point that {{is directly related to the}} max pressure of the pipeline/system. When the product on the inlet of the valve exceeds the set point it forces the valve to open and allows the excess surge to be bled out in to a breakout tank or recirculated into a different pipeline. So in the event of the surge, the majority of the pressure is absorbed in the liquid and pipe, and just that quantity of liquid which is necessary to relieve pressures of unsafe proportions is discharged to the surge relief tank. Some valve manufactures use the piston style with a nitrogen control system and external plenums, while others use elastomeric tubes, external pilots, or internal chambers.|$|E

40|$|Magnetically impelled arc butt (MIAB) welding is a {{pressure}} welding process used for joining of pipes and tubes with an {{external magnetic field}} affecting arc rotation along the tube circumference. In this work, MIAB welding of low alloy steel (T 11) tubes were carried out to study the microstructural changes occurring in thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ). To qualify the process for the welding applications where pressure could be up to 300  bar, the MIAB welds are studied with variations of arc current and arc rotation time. It is found that TMAZ shows higher hardness than that in base metal and displays higher weld tensile strength and ductility due to bainitic transformation.
