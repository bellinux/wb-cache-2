40|$|The {{field of}} animal-microorganism {{interactions}} has grown tremendously {{in recent decades}} as {{our understanding of how}} microorganisms influence host health and development has widened from the historical perspective as simply agents of disease. The knowledge gained from studying animal-microorganism interactions can bring about new ways for understanding the biology and ecology of the host of interest. Currently there has been little study of microorganisms associated with echinoderms despite the biological, ecological and economic interests that surround these organisms. Echinoderms are potentially interesting microbial environments due to their comparatively simple digestive systems and feeding habits, the lack of a specialized excretory organ and the influence disease has on population regulation for which there are very few described pathogens. This thesis focuses mostly on asteroids but aims to address three questions. 1) What microorganisms are associated with asteroids, 2) what variables shape the microbiome and 3) What are the potential relationships that can occur between the microorganisms found and the host. The third question cannot be fully addressed with the current data. Nonetheless, each chapter presents hypotheses on this subject in the <b>discussion</b> <b>sections.</b> <b>Chapter</b> 1 begins by examining the commonality and genotypic divergence of circular single-stranded DNA viruses among three echinoderm classes. Chapter 2 investigates the diversity and community composition of prokaryotes among asteroids and factors shaping the asteroid microbiome. The results presented herein provide the most comprehensive survey to date of the microbiome composition of echinoderms which provides an important baseline understanding for future work to elucidate the relationships for this host system...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of carbohydrate-containing natural products {{is a significant}} goal in organic chemistry. An important problem in carbohydrate chemistry is the efficient, stereoselective formation of the O-glycosidic linkage. We have utilized glycosyl fluorides as intermediates to attain highly efficient {{synthesis of}} these important molecules. ^ The introduction to chapter I reviews the previously reported methodologies for {{the preparation of the}} O-glycosidic linkage and the chemistry of glycosyl fluorides. The previous biological and synthetic investigations of the rhynchosporosides are also presented. The results and <b>discussion</b> <b>section</b> of <b>chapter</b> I discusses the technology that has been developed in these laboratories for the synthesis of oligosaccharides employing glycosyl fluorides. The synthesis of a hexasaccharide and a series of phytotoxic oligosaccharides, the rhynchosporosides, is presented. The latter is the first oligosaccharide, natural product total synthesis utilizing solely glycosyl fluorides as the glycosyl donors. These methods were found to be highly effective for the synthesis of these oligosaccharides. ^ The introduction to chapter II reviews the approaches to the construction of the 2 -deoxy O-glycosidic linkage that have been previously reported in the literature; additionally, the novel 1, 2 -migration reaction, that was developed in these laboratories, is surveyed. The results and <b>discussion</b> <b>section</b> discusses new methodology for the preparation of 2 -deoxy glycosides utilizing the 1, 2 -migration reaction. This approach was found to be highly effective for the synthesis of both (alpha) - and (beta) - 2 -deoxy glycosidic linkages. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare elementary teacher preparation programs at Utah State University as a basis for evaluation of the SODIA program. SODIA is the acronym for a new elementary teacher preparation program initiated in the Fall of 1972 which was designed to be field centered and competency based. The population of the study consisted of 104 elementary student teachers enrolled in student teaching during Fall and Winter Quarters of the 1973 - 74 academic year. There were four groups identified by the type of preparation program they had experienced. The groups were SODIA (the new program for preparing elementary teachers), Former (the program for preparing elementary teachers prior to the inception of SODIA), Sophomore Bloc Only (the program that was the former program except that the student had Sophomore Bloc of the SODIA program), and Junior Bloc Only (the program that was the former program except that the student had Junior Bloc of the SODIA program). There were five instruments used to collect data. They were the School Personnel Research and Evaluation Services tests (a form of the National Teacher Exam), Rokeach Dogmatism Scale, Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory, Purdue Student-Teacher Opinionnaire, and Teaching Skills Self Rating Scale. A one-way analysis of variance was used to test for significant differences between groups. There were no significant differences found {{with the exception of the}} Sophomore Bloc Only group scoring significantly lower on the Science-Mathematics, Common Weighted Examination, and Education in the Elementary School sub-sections of the School Personnel Research and Evaluation Services test. The recommendations of the study were: 1. It is suggested that further analysis of performance of student teachers be made to provide a basis for continuing evaluation of the SODIA elementary teacher preparation program. 2. It is suggested that an additional study be undertaken considering the limitations of the present study as described in the <b>Discussion</b> <b>section</b> (<b>Chapter</b> V). 3. It is suggested that an analysis of success of first year teachers, who were trained in the SODIA program, be made to provide a basis for continuing evaluation of the SODIA program. 4. It is suggested that a five year longitudinal study be made to assess long term effects of the SODIA program...|$|R

40|$|Result and <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> play an {{important}} role in theses as one of the research reports. Writing result and <b>discussion</b> <b>section</b> is often bothersome for some writers, it also holds true for the undergraduate students as novice writers. This study aimed to investigate the rhetorical moves of result and <b>discussion</b> <b>section</b> of theses together with the lexical expressions that are written by the undergradu ate students. An understanding of rhetorical moves used by the undergraduate students in writing their result and <b>discussion</b> <b>section</b> is hoped can give input for academic writing’s instructor to improve students’ writing ability in the future, particularly in writing the result and <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> of theses. The research method is descriptive qualitative study with discourse analysis method to identify the moves. Seven undergraduate theses of experimental studies were selected as subject of the research. The result and <b>discussion</b> <b>section</b> then were analyzed based on the result model proposed by Paltridge & Starfield (2007) for result <b>section</b> and <b>discussion</b> model proposed by Dudley - Evans (1994) for <b>discussion</b> <b>section.</b> Some samples of proposition of result a nd <b>discussion</b> <b>section</b> were also used to identify the lexical expressions in the result and <b>discussion</b> <b>section.</b> Then, the rhetorical moves were rated by the writer and two other raters for triangulation. The results showed that there are no linear rhetorica l moves emerging in the result section. At the same time, it was found that there is cyclical structure that mostly arises from the part or stages of investigation of experimental research. Whereas in the <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> there are also no linear rhetor ical moves found. Moreover, one unanticipated finding showed that not all <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> under study have cyclical structure. Only three <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> have cyclical structure and only one of them employed key cycle as mentioned by Dudley - Evans (1994). For the lexical expression, it was found that in the result sections the lexical expressions are more obvious in showing the function of the moves. Therefore the moves in result section are easily identified by its lexical expressions. While in the <b>discussion</b> <b>section</b> the lexical expressions are less obvious therefore in order to identify the moves the researcher used comprehension of the text. In conclusion, the rhetorical moves of result and <b>discussion</b> <b>section</b> of theses written by the English depar tment undergraduate students of UNESA, did not follow the model proposed by Paltdrige & Starfiled (2007) for result section and Dudley - Evans (1994) for <b>discussion</b> <b>section,</b> since the rhetorical moves were not ordered like the order of each model. Accordingl y, based on the present result, it is necessary for the academic writing instructors or teachers to provide clear instructional strategies and exercises to improve the undergraduate students ability in writing their result and <b>discussion</b> <b>section...</b>|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} in the study of genre analysis, not only among applied linguists and language teachers for pedagogical reasons but also among research communities. Move analysis is one of the genre-based approaches used to analyse the structure of texts whereby the texts of the chosen corpus were analysed into ‘hierarchical schematic structures or Moves’. One of the genres that have received extensive attention from researchers in move analysis study is Research Article (RA). This is due to its importance in discussing and sharing academic knowledge (Peacock, 2002; Huang, 2014). Therefore, the aim of this work is to analyse the move structure in the <b>discussion</b> <b>section</b> of research articles in the field of Pharmacy. The two objectives of the study is to investigate the extent which the <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> in Pharmacy articles can be used with reference to a framework of <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> in Applied Linguistics articles and to explore how the writers in Pharmacy construct arguments about the meaning and significance of results in commenting on result moves. In meeting the objectives, twenty <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> of Pharmacy research articles have been selected from an international journal and analysed using a schematic structure of Applied Linguistics. Overall, the schematic structure of Applied Linguistics <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> can be used to analyse the Pharmacy <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> with some modification of the existing framework. All the four moves in the Applied Linguistic framework also occurred in the Pharmacy <b>discussion</b> <b>sections.</b> There are also two additional moves that occurred in the Pharmacy <b>discussion</b> <b>sections.</b> Most of the <b>discussion</b> <b>sections</b> were dominated by Move 3 (Reporting a result) which occurred in 29...|$|R
