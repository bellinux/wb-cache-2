2500|$|On August 13, 1994, C-130A N135FF, c/n 3148, {{delivered}} as USAF 56-0540, in December 1957, {{call sign}} Tanker 82, crashed near Pearblossom, California while fighting {{a fire in}} the San Gabriel Mountains. Eyewitnesses reported seeing an explosion followed by the separation of the right wing at the wing attach point. Due to the extremely rugged terrain, the NTSB recovered {{only a small portion of}} the wreckage, and its preliminary conclusion that an explosion caused by a fuel leak led to the wing separation was based largely on eyewitness statements. A subsequent independent investigation in 1997 led by Douglas Herlihy, a former NTSB investigator, reexamined the site and the wreckage, and found no evidence of an explosion, but rather found evidence of structural failure due to <b>fatigue</b> <b>stress.</b> The NTSB subsequently reexamined its findings, and found evidence of fatigue cracking [...] "consistent with overstress separation", and ultimately revised their findings. The initial eyewitness reports of an explosion are not inconsistent with a fatigue-caused wing separation. Similar eyewitness reports were given in the 2002 crash, and an analysis of a video of that crash showed the initiation of a fireball 0.9 seconds after the wing separated.|$|E

Often, FOD {{does not lead to}} sudden catastrophic failure, yet such damage can dramatically reduce the lifetime of components subjected to cyclic <b>fatigue</b> <b>stresses.</b> Turbine blades, for example, are susceptible to debris strikes and also experience significant fatigue loading. The current study seeks to develop insight into the driving forces and predictability of fatigue failures induced by foreign object damage.

The material used for this study, a titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, is commonly used for blades in the front, low-temperature stages of the engine, where the initial foreign object strikes can occur.
