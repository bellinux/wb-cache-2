Mostyn's supporters quickly published a response, A Vindication of the Conduct of Captain M-N, attributing blame solely to Hampton Courts tendency to roll in heavy swell.

The State Premiership final against Launceston at York Park saw Devine's North Hobart win by a record 20 goals. He was nicknamed [...] "Dead Legs" [...] due to his loping running style, which belied his speed and hard-at-the-ball playing style. He returned to coach North Hobart in 1981 which by then was a struggling outfit and returned a disappointing one win for the season in taking out the wooden spoon before retiring.|$|R

A higher value of P constant indicates a higher concentration of non-radiative recombination centers. At the linear region of the power law fitting curve of PD-EL, the obtained P constants for <b>LED</b> <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>LED</b> II are 1.82 and 2.21, respectively; non-radiative recombination centers are greatly decreased in <b>LED</b> <b>I.</b> With the driving current increasing, the increasing rate of PD-EL curves of two devices decrease and gradually merge with each other as one. It is dominated by non-radiative Auger recombination, since the driving current in this region is high. The two LEDs are quenched at high driving current, so that the two curves are gradually becoming identical. <b>LED</b> <b>I</b> <b>and</b> <b>LED</b> II have similar geometric structures, except for the nucleation layer which causes different GaN growth crystal quality, that influence performance of the devices.|$|R

5000|$|Osvajači were {{originally}} formed in 1990. They recorded two studio albums, Krv <b>i</b> <b>led</b> <b>and</b> Sam, and disbanded in 1997. In 1998, former Osvajači vocalist Zvonko Pantović [...] "Čipi" [...] and keyboardist Nebojša Jakovljević formed the rock/pop/folk band Osvajači All Stars, which soon became {{known simply as}} Osvajači. In 1999, {{one of the original}} Osvajači members, guitarist Dragan Urošević, with a new band (which included former Osvajači member Saša Popović) released the album Vrelina under the name Osvajači. This album is widely considered by fans and critics the continuation of the original Osvajači work, which is not the case with the albums released by Pantović and Jakovljević during the 1999-2002 period. In 2005, Pantović, Jakovljević and Urošević reunited under the name Osvajači, ending the cooperation in 2009.|$|R
30|$|In this work, we further {{improved}} the luminous flux and lumen efficiency of white LEDs {{by a simple}} imprinting technique to form the textured phosphor structure, denoted as LED III. The LEDs with flat phosphor and half-spherical lens structures were denoted as <b>LEDs</b> <b>I</b> <b>and</b> II. With this textured surface, the total internal reflection at the interface of air and silicone could be reduced. Furthermore, this surface increases the probability of blue light scattering, which is supported by haze measurement results. Accordingly, more blue light can excite phosphor again due to the enhancement of utilization efficiency of blue light. Meanwhile, more yellow light can be extracted by the textured phosphor structure. Additionally, we further investigate the far-field emission pattern for <b>LED</b> <b>I,</b> <b>LED</b> II, <b>and</b> <b>LED</b> III, respectively.|$|R

5000|$|Shortly {{after his}} 1993 indictment, Sessa, {{at the urging}} of his wife, pleaded guilty to four murders and became a {{government}} witness. Sessa went on to testify in eight mob trials. In the summer of 1997, Sessa was released on bail. However, that December, Sessa was arrested for gun possession by a convicted felon, domestic violence against his wife and stealing guns from his son. In 2000, Sessa was sentenced to time already served for the four murders. He told sentencing judge Jack Weinstein, [...] "I hate everything about the life <b>I</b> <b>led,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hope that it ends soon because it keeps destroying families and kids who are infatuated with it and can't wait to be 'goodfellas.' I wish I could tell them what it really is." ...|$|R

60|$|On {{the other}} hand, though I {{was not without}} secret reproaches of my own {{conscience}} for the life <b>I</b> <b>led,</b> <b>and</b> {{that even in the}} greatest height of the satisfaction I ever took, yet I had the terrible prospect of poverty and starving, which lay on me as a frightful spectre, so that there was no looking behind me. But as poverty brought me into it, so fear of poverty kept me in it, and I frequently resolved to leave it quite off, if I could but come to lay up money enough to maintain me. But these were thoughts of no weight, and whenever he came to me they vanished; for his company was so delightful, that there was no being melancholy when he was there; the reflections were all the subject of those hours when I was alone.|$|R

5000|$|In 2005, Pantović, Urošević and Jakovljević reunited {{under the}} name Osvajači. They {{performed}} for several years, playing songs from Krv <b>i</b> <b>led</b> <b>and</b> Sam, but also the song [...] "Minut ćutanja" [...] previously recorded with Jovanović. The lineup, besides Pantović, Urošević and Jakovljević, featured the bass guitarist Mikica Zdravković (also {{a member of the}} punk rock band Čovek Bez Sluha) and the drummer Dejan Nikolić. The band announced the release of a new studio album, performing several new songs on their live appearances. However, Urošević decided to leave the band (Zdravković and Nikolić also leaving with him). Pantović and Jakovljević continued to perform as Osvajači (although the band is essentially a continuation of All Stars Osvajači, as it features the guitarist Bane Jelić, who was the third member of All Stars Osvajači). Urošević and Pantović formed the hard rock band Čipi & Industrija. Pantović currently cooperates with both Jakovljević and Urošević, and is the vocalist for both bands.|$|R

5000|$|The band's {{debut album}} Krv <b>i</b> <b>led</b> (Blood <b>and</b> Ice), {{released}} through PGP-RTB in 1990, was mostly glam metal-oriented. In 1994, the band's song [...] "Pronađi me" [...] ("Find Me") {{was released on}} Komuna compilation album Pakleni vozači: Jugoslovenski hard rock (Hell Riders: Yugoslav Hard Rock). The band's second album Sam (Alone), released in 1995 through PGP-RTS, on which {{they were joined by}} the keyboardist Nebojša Jakovljević, marked the band's slight shift towards a heavier sound. After releasing a compilation album The Best Of in 1997, Osvajači disbanded.|$|R

30|$|The EQEs of <b>LED</b> <b>I,</b> <b>LED</b> II <b>and</b> <b>LED</b> III {{normalized}} to the <b>LED</b> <b>I</b> {{have also}} been calculated, {{as shown by the}} line curves in the Fig.  5. With the current density increasing, the normalized EQEs of <b>LED</b> II <b>and</b> <b>LED</b> III increase <b>and</b> saturate at fixed values of 1.07 and 0.41, respectively, which are just approximately equal to the square of the n ratios of <b>LED</b> II <b>and</b> <b>LED</b> III versus <b>LED</b> <b>I,</b> as calculated in the Fig.  4, indicating that the total effective electron concentration is the key factor, which can also effectively present the EQE of LEDs. As for LED II, it has the highest total effective electron concentration, which means the highest EQE. But at the same time, because of the less electron concentration accumulated in the individual quantum well, this will avoid the Auger recombination and minimize the droop effects at the high current density injection. For <b>LED</b> <b>I,</b> the total effective electron concentration is less than LED II, but because of that the electrons are mostly restricted in the first quantum well close to the n-type GaN layer, which can lead to a stronger Auger recombination and result in the droop effect.|$|R
