We defined <b>hypouricemia</b> as serum uric acid level of ≤ 2. 0 mg/dL. We checked the medical history of all the study subjects and compared the rates of complications including urinary stones and kidney diseases among those with or without <b>hypouricemia.</b> The prevalence of <b>hypouricemia</b> was 0. 19 % in St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, and 0. 58 % in Sanin Rousai Hospital, Yonago.

Diagnosis of renal <b>hypouricemia</b> is based on biochemical markers, i. e., <b>hypouricemia</b> and in-creased fractional excretion of UA (FE-UA). Renal <b>hypouricemia</b> type 1 (RHUC 1, MIM# 220150) is a recessive condition caused by mutations in the SLC 22 A 12 gene encoding the transporter URAT 1, which leads to a partial UA absorption defect [1 - 5].

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was: 1. The {{evaluation}} of the tubular function in individuals with primary renal <b>hypouricemia</b> based on the serum and urine biochemical analysis and the metabonomic profile of urine analyzed by 1 H NMR spectroscopy. 2. The mutational analysis of SLC 22 A 12 gene in subjects with primary renal <b>hypouricemia</b> originated from Greece. 3. The evaluation of the utility of 1 H NMR spectroscopy in the detection of early urine alterations in patients treated with aminoglycosides as well as the detection of any electrolyte abnormalities in these patients. Primary renal <b>hypouricemia</b> (PRH) refers to a rare condition of increased renal urate clearance, caused by an isolated inborn error of membrane transport of urate in the renal proximal tubule. Defects in SLC 22 A 12 gene, which encodes the renal urate transporter URAT 1, have been reported to be related with the disease pathogenesis. This is the first study that assessed tubular function in primary renal <b>hypouricemia</b> using NMR-based metabonomic urine analysis. The study groups consisted of 36 unrelated asymptomatic subjects with primary renal <b>hypouricemia,</b> defined as serum uric acid levels (sUA) 10 %, after exclusion of diseases and drugs that may affect urate homeostasis, and 39 sex and age-matched healthy individuals with normal sUA levels (> 4. 0 mg/dL) and FEUAC (His 142 His) in exon 2 of the SLC 22 A 12 gene. The absence of SLC 22 A 12 gene mutations in Greek subjects with primary renal <b>hypouricemia</b> may indicate the existence of a novel urate transporter or the possibility that, a genetic mutation that does not cause a change in the amino acid sequence of the resulting protein can still alter the protein’s function.

40|$|Renal <b>hypouricemia</b> is an {{inherited}} disorder characterized by impaired renal urate (uric acid) reabsorption and subsequent low serum urate levels, with severe complications such as exercise-induced {{acute renal failure}} and nephrolithiasis. We previously identified SLC 22 A 12, also known as URAT 1, as a causative gene of renal <b>hypouricemia.</b> However, hypouricemic patients without URAT 1 mutations, as well as genome-wide association studies between urate and SLC 2 A 9 (also called GLUT 9), imply that GLUT 9 could be another causative gene of renal <b>hypouricemia.</b> With a large human database, we identified two loss-of-function heterozygous mutations in GLUT 9, which occur in the highly conserved “sugar transport proteins signatures 1 / 2. ” Both mutations result in loss of positive charges, {{one of which is}} reported to be an important membrane topology determinant. The oocyte expression study revealed that both GLUT 9 isoforms showed high urate transport activities, whereas the mutated GLUT 9 isoforms markedly reduced them.

BackgroundRecently, SLC 22 A 12 {{has been identified}} as a urate-anion exchanger in the human kidney. MethodsWe screened for polymorphisms of SLC 22 A 12 and conducted an association study between genetic polymorphisms and urate levels in an epidemiologic cohort representing the general population in Japan. Functional significance of mutations was assessed by oocyte expression analysis. ResultsWe found five missense, one nonsense, and one deletion mutations [R 90 H, A 226 V, R 228 E, W 258 Stop, Q 312 L, D 313 A (deletion of 313 D- 333 P), and R 477 H] in 24 subjects with <b>hypouricemia</b> recruited from an epidemiologic cohort (Suita Study) representing the general population in Japan (N = 1875). A statistical analysis indicated that the 90 H (N = 14), 477 H (N = 5), and 258 Stop (hetero + homo N = 82 + 3) alleles were associated with <b>hypouricemia.</b> The alleles 228 E and 313 A (deletion of 313 D- 333 P) were found just once in the total population. In vitro oocyte expression analysis indicated that 313 A (deletion of 313 D- 333 P) had no urate transport activity, indicating that this is a newly identified mutation for idiopathic renal <b>hypouricemia.</b> Intriguingly, the allele frequency of 258 Stop was unexpectedly high (2. 37 %). However, this inactivating mutation {{does not seem to be}} harmful in the general population. The effects of common polymorphisms of SLC 22 A 12 were also investigated. Based on linkage disequilibrium, 16 common polymorphisms were categorized into six distinct groups, and six representative genotypes were determined. None of these six common polymorphisms affected the serum uric acid level. A haplotype analysis also suggested that these common genotypes/haplotypes were not important in determining the serum uric acid levels in the general population.

40|$|The {{decreased}} serum {{uric acid}} levels {{observed in a}} considerable number of diseases or conditions are usually characterized according to whether there is decreased production or increased gastrointestinal and/ or renal excretion rates of uric acid (1). Among the factors which may influence uric acid metabolism, excess or deficiency of some hormones apparently induces abnormal serum uric acid levels. Even though <b>hypouricemia</b> due to increased renal uric acid clear-ance is associated with hypoparathyroidism, primary aldosteronism, and inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone (2), decreased uric acid levels have not previously been noted in patients with thyro-toxicosis. Here we describe a patient aged 51 years with subacute thyroiditis who developed <b>hypouricemia</b> and urine urate wasting associated with thyrotoxicosis, while during disease remission the values of the uric acid metabolism parameters paralleled those of thyroid function (Table 1).

We performed a genome-wide homozygosity screen and linkage analysis and identified the candidate gene SLC 2 A 9, which encodes the glucose transporter 9 (GLUT 9). Both families had homozygous SLC 2 A 9 mutations: A missense mutation (L 75 R) in six affected members of one family and a 36 -kb deletion, resulting in a truncated protein, in the other. In vitro, the L 75 R mutation dramatically impaired transport of uric acid.
