40|$|We {{present a}} general {{procedure}} for obtaining the coefficients of the scalar bubble and triangle <b>integral</b> <b>functions</b> of one-loop amplitudes. Coefficients are extracted by considering two-particle and triple unitarity cuts of the corresponding bubble and triangle <b>integral</b> <b>functions.</b> After choosing a specific parameterisation {{of the cut}} loop momentum we can uniquely identify the coefficients of the desired <b>integral</b> <b>functions</b> simply by examining the behaviour of the cut integrand as the unconstrained parameters of the cut loop momentum approach infinity. In this way we can produce compact forms for scalar integral coefficients. Applications of this method are presented for both QCD and electroweak processes, including an alternative form for the recently computed three-mass triangle coefficient in the six-photon amplitude $A_ 6 (1 ^-, 2 ^+, 3 ^-, 4 ^+, 5 ^-, 6 ^+) $. The direct nature of this extraction procedure allows for a very straightforward automation of the procedure. Comment: 42 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|In {{this comment}} it is {{pointed out that}} the perturbative {{dynamics}} of general massive field theories can be mapped to delimited sums of determined <b>integral</b> <b>functions.</b> The limits on the sums are the remaining obstacle to finding the general g-loop, or derivative expanded, form of the scattering. In previous works the classical scattering of scalar and gauge field theories has been formulated with the use of partitions of numbers [1],[2]. The use of the classical scattering has been used in the formulation of the perturbative quantum dynamics [3],[4]. There are simplifications in the quantum scattering {{with the use of the}} determined <b>integral</b> <b>functions,</b> presented in [3]. The content of this letter is to show that the perturbative dynamics of a general massive theory can be reduced to the, as yet delimited, sums of numbers parameterizing the products of these <b>integral</b> <b>functions.</b> In massive φ 3 theory, with coupling g, the scattering takes on the form [3], g L m q ∏ s nij i...|$|R
2500|$|This {{means that}} all media, from {{literature}} to new digital media, is unable to make a radical break away from what has come before. Media continues to “function in a constant dialectic with earlier media” (p.50) forms, where both old and new are able to impact on one another regardless of which came first. For example, “users of older media such as film and television can seek to appropriate and refashion digital graphics, just as digital graphics artists can refashion film and television” (p.48). However these appropriations within digital technologies of immediacy have often sought to deny mediation. Bolter and Grusin elaborate on the double logic of this form of remediation as an <b>integral</b> <b>function</b> of contemporary immediacy in media. Although Bolter and Grusin acknowledge that not “all of our culture's claims of remediation are equally compelling or that we could necessarily identify all of the strategies through which digital media remediate and are remediated by their predecessors” (p.55) they outline various ways in which “the double logic of remediation can function explicitly or implicitly” (p.55) can be restated in the following ways: ...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The analysis of well test data by methods which only use the pressure change can be ambiguous, and analysis using the derivative of the pressure change is often distorted by random error in the data or data noise. Although various "smoothing" techniques have been used to reduce data noise, some concern exists that smoothing procedures may alter the basic character of the data. In this work, we use pressure integral and pressure <b>integral</b> derivative <b>functions</b> to reduce the data noise. First, we perform the conventional semilog analysis on the well test data using the pressure <b>integral</b> <b>functions.</b> Then, we demonstrate the applicability of the pressure change integral and derivative of pressure change <b>integral</b> <b>functions.</b> In this manner we couple the <b>integral</b> <b>functions</b> with the pressure change and pressure change derivative functions to derive useful qualitative and quantitative information from these test data. We also analyze well test data with these methods without the use of superposition time functions such as, Horner time and Agarwal "effective time" functions. In addition, we introduce a numerical technique to generate the pressure <b>integral</b> <b>functions.</b> Thus, we integrate the pressure analysis approach with the pressure integral analysis approach and develop a consistent and applicable method for the analysis of well test data...|$|R
