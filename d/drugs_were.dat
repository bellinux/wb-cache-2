5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, {{when the}} only {{anticonvulsant}} <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> the sedative bromides (discovered 1857) and phenobarbital (1912), the ketogenic diet was widely used and studied. This changed in 1938 when H. Houston Merritt and Tracy Putnam discovered phenytoin (Dilantin), and the focus of research shifted to discovering new drugs. With the introduction of sodium valproate in the 1970s, <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> available to neurologists that were effective across {{a broad range of}} epileptic syndromes and seizure types. The use of the ketogenic diet, by this time restricted to difficult cases such as Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, declined further.|$|E

5|$|Under Carl Duisberg's leadership, Bayer {{was firmly}} {{committed}} {{to the standards of}} ethical drugs, as opposed to patent medicines.

Advertising drugs directly to consumers was considered unethical and strongly opposed by many medical organizations; that was the domain of patent medicines. Therefore, Bayer was limited to marketing Aspirin directly to doctors.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT : Labelling <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> {{important}} issue nowadays {{in a modern}} society. Although it is generally believed that legal <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> good <b>drugs</b> and illegal <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> bad <b>drugs,</b> it <b>is</b> evident that some people do not aware about {{the side effects of}} drugs used. Therefore, a key contention of this philosophical essay is that explores harms minimisation policy, discuss whether legal <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> good <b>drugs</b> and illegal <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> bad <b>drugs</b> and explores relation of drugs misuse in a psychiatric nursing setting and dual diagnosis. Key words: Legal, good drugs, illegal, bad drugs. <br /...|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, opium dens {{used to be}} common in the Sungei Road area. The <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> popular with workers looking for a cheap way to ease the {{hardship}} of the day's toil. The opium addicts were mainly poor, elderly people from working-class groups. In early 1991, a spate of fires destroyed more than 20 shophouses along Sungei Road. Most of the century-old shophouses, crumbling with age, had become potential fire hazards for its residents. The first fire incident left two people injured and 61 homeless. As a result, many of its buildings were torn down for safety reason and its inhabitants relocated in later years.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the release of Third/Sister Lovers, Bell died in a car accident. He {{apparently}} lost control of his car while driving alone and was killed when he struck a lamp post after hitting the curb a hundred feet before. A blood test found that he was not drunk at the time, and no <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> found on him other than a bottle of vitamins. Bell is believed to have either fallen asleep at the wheel or become distracted.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{would become}} the first inmate to be {{executed}} in a new chamber that was built in 1998 at Utah State Prison for use in either firing squads or lethal injections. Two people, whose identities were withheld, were selected to administer individual injections, of which only one was lethal so that neither would know with certainty who executed the prisoner. The prison selected among paramedics or nurses because the American Medical Association prohibits licensed physicians from participating in executions. A mild sedative was delivered intravenously to calm Parsons before the deadly <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> administered.|$|E

50|$|Street <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} abused <b>drugs</b> that <b>are</b> bought illegally {{and have}} many nicknames. Examples of street <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> heroin, marijuana and its psychoactive ingredient of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and cocaine.|$|R
5|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry has {{roots in the}} apothecary shops of Europe in the 1800s, where pharmacists provided local traditional medicines to customers, which included extracts like morphine, quinine, and strychnine. Therapeutically important drugs like camptothecin (from Camptotheca acuminata, used in traditional Chinese medicine) and taxol (from the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia) were derived from medicinal plants. The Vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, used as anti-cancer <b>drugs,</b> <b>were</b> discovered in the 1950s from the Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus.|$|E
5|$|Toxicology testing became {{important}} in the 20th century. In the 19th century, laws regulating <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> more relaxed. For example, in the U.S., the government could only ban a drug after a company had been prosecuted for selling products that harmed customers. However, {{in response to the}} Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster of 1937 in which the eponymous drug killed more than 100 users, the U.S. congress passed laws that required safety testing of drugs on animals before they could be marketed. Other countries enacted similar legislation. In the 1960s, in reaction to the Thalidomide tragedy, further laws were passed requiring safety testing on pregnant animals before a drug can be sold.|$|E
5|$|At a {{preliminary}} hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While {{there was no question}} as to whether the <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges.|$|E
30|$|Introduction: Use {{of generic}} <b>drugs,</b> which <b>are</b> bioequivalent to brand-name <b>drugs,</b> <b>is</b> now a common practice. However, {{there is still}} concern among {{patients}} and physicians that brand-name <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> more efficient than generic drugs (1).|$|R
50|$|Nationally, the <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> {{listed under}} Schedule 9 (Prohibited) of the Poisons Standard. Accordingly, the <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> {{prohibited}} in all states and territories.|$|R
50|$|Preventive <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> used {{to reduce}} the frequency, duration, and {{severity}} of migraine attacks. Because of frequent unpleasant and sometimes debilitating side effects, preventive <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> only prescribed for those migraineurs whose {{quality of life is}} significantly adversely affected. The most commonly prescribed drugs for migraine prevention are beta-blockers, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. The <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> started at a low dose, which is gradually increased until therapeutic effects develop, the ceiling dose for the chosen <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> reached, or side effects become intolerable.|$|R
5|$|On May 3, 1969, while Hendrix {{was passing}} through customs at Toronto International Airport, {{authorities}} detained him after finding {{a small amount}} of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, he was formally charged with drug possession and released on $10,000 bail. He was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial, which took place in December of that year. For the Crown to prove possession they had to show that Hendrix knew the <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> there. During the jury trial he testified that a fan had given him a vial of what he thought was legal medication, which he put in his bag not knowing what was in it. He was acquitted of the charges. Mitchell and Redding later revealed that everyone had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto; both men also stated they believed that the drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag without his knowledge.|$|E
5|$|The Madchester {{scene of}} the 1980s, from which groups {{including}} New Order, The Smiths, The Stone Roses, the Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, 808 State, James and The Charlatans emerged, was based on clubs such as the world-famous The Haçienda. The period {{was the subject of}} the film 24 Hour Party People. Many of the big clubs suffered problems with organised crime at that time; Haslam describes one where staff were so completely intimidated that free admission and drinks were demanded (and given) and <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> openly dealt. Following a series of drug-related violent incidents, The Hacienda closed in 1998. In 1988, Manchester was often referred to as Madchester for its rave scene. Owned by Tony Wilson's Factory Records, it was given the catalogue number FAC51 and official club name, FAC51 The Hacienda. Known for developing many talented 1980s influential acts, it also influenced the graphic design industry via Factory artists such as Peter Saville (PSA), Octavo (8vo), Central Design Station, etc. The memorabilia from this club holds a high value among collectors and fans of these artists and the club. Peter Saville was most notable for his minimalistic influence that still affects contemporary graphic design everywhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} panel {{had sought}} Cho's medical records for several weeks, {{but due to}} privacy laws, Virginia Tech was prohibited from releasing them without permission from Cho's family, even after his death. The panel had considered using subpoenas to obtain his records. On June 12, 2007, Cho's family released his medical records to the panel, although the panel said that the records were not enough. The panel obtained additional information by court order. Like the perpetrators of both the Columbine and Jokela school massacres, Cho was prescribed the antidepressant drug Prozac prior to his rampage, a substance suspected by Peter Breggin and David Healy of leading to suicidal behaviors. It is not known if Cho ever complied in filling or taking this prescription; or if he had taken and then discontinued the prescribed medication. The toxicology test from the official autopsy later showed that neither psychiatric nor any kind of illegal <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> in his system {{during the time of}} the shooting.|$|E
5000|$|Club drugs, {{also called}} rave drugs, or party <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> a loosely defined {{category}} of recreational <b>drugs</b> which <b>are</b> associated with discothèques in the 1970s and nightclubs, dance clubs, electronic dance music parties, and raves in the 1980s to the 2010s. Unlike many other categories, such as opiates, which are established according to pharmaceutical or chemical properties, club <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> a [...] "category of convenience", in which <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> included {{due to the}} locations they are consumed and/or where the user goes while {{under the influence of}} the <b>drugs.</b> Club <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> generally used by teens and young adults. This group of <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> also called [...] "designer drugs", as most are synthesized in chemical lab (e.g., MDMA, ketamine, LSD) rather than being sourced from plants (as with marijuana, which comes from the cannabis plant).|$|R
50|$|Not all club <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> {{addictive}} (e.g. nitrous oxide). However, some club <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> addictive. Amphetamine heavily used in recreational fashion pose {{a serious}} risk of addiction.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Drug</b> {{harmfulness}} <b>is</b> {{the degree}} to which a psychoactive <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> harmful to a user and is measured in various ways, such as by addictiveness and the potential for physical harm. More harmful <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> called [...] "hard drugs" [...] and less harmful <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> called [...] "soft drugs". The term [...] "soft drug" [...] is considered controversial by its critics as it may imply that soft drugs cause no or insignificant harm.|$|R
5|$|Reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness {{characterized}} by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver, can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illness or infection. From 1981 through 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in people younger than 18 {{were reported to}} the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding the onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a respiratory infection, chickenpox, or diarrhea. Salicylates were detectable in 81.9% of children for whom test results were reported. After the association between Reye's syndrome and aspirin was reported, and safety measures to prevent it (including a Surgeon General's warning, and changes to the labeling of aspirin-containing <b>drugs)</b> <b>were</b> implemented, aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the United States, as did the number of reported cases of Reye's syndrome; a similar decline {{was found in the}} United Kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration now recommends aspirin (or aspirin-containing products) should not be given to anyone under the age of 12 who has a fever, and the British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency recommends children who are under 16 years of age should not take aspirin, unless it is on the advice of a doctor.|$|E

25|$|At {{the press}} conference held by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation on July 17, 2007, it was {{announced}} that three different <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> found in Nancy Benoit's system: hydrocodone, hydromorphone and Xanax. All three <b>drugs</b> <b>were</b> found to be at levels investigators considered normal for therapeutic treatment (as opposed to recreational use or abuse.) A blood-alcohol level was found at 0.184. Dr. Kris Sperry, the medical examiner, added it was impossible to say whether any of the blood findings was due to ingestion of alcohol or the post-mortem process. It was also ruled out that Nancy was sedated by Chris before she was murdered.|$|E
