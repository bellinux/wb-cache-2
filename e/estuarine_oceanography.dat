40|$|Some {{aspects of}} the <b>estuarine</b> <b>oceanography</b> of the Vembanad lake between Cochin and Azhikode are discussed. Since {{this part of the}} lake is in {{confluence}} with the Arabian sea at its southern and northern ends, at Cochin and Azhikode, its circulation pattern and other characteristics are different from what they are between Cochin and Vaikom. Because of the position of these two mouths, which are exposed to the same tidal cycles, the high tides and low tides each producing two opposite flows respectively converge and diverge leaving a null zone, almost free of the tidal effect, around Kadakara, situated midway between Cochin and Azhikode. Another significant feature of this pairt of the estuary is an extreme low-salinity i«gion between Karthedam and Cherai during monsoon and early postmonsoon, brought about by the deflected waiters of the Periyar, opening at the northern end of the estuary...|$|E
40|$|IDENTIFIERS *Estuaries; National Science Foundation <b>Estuarine</b> <b>Oceanography</b> {{is one in}} {{a series}} of single-topic probfem modules 'intended for use in {{undergraduate}} and earth science courses. Designed ' for those interested in coastal oceanography or limhology, the module is structured as a laboratory supplement for undergraduate college classes but should. be useful at all levels. The module has two distinct parts: a text'covering general concepts a d_streising the small-scale technology necessars to study small nat al bodies of water, and a rather detailed, exercise describing an ideal estuary. Emphasis throughout the module is on techniques thet have evolved for low-budget studies of physical oceanographic phenomena, particularly water movements ahd mixing _ problems. Although estuaries are emphasized, most of. the tephnighe's discussed are equallir applicable to lakes. Like other modules in the series, this mOdule is inquiry- and problem-oriented, dealing with interdisciplinary, contemporary, and pragmatic aspects of the subject natter. It'is designed t be open-ended so that ideas can be incorporated into higher level classwork. Supporting materials such, as specification * of cur ent drogues, bathirmetric-survay data sheet, current measurement data, drift-can data, and inshore T-S probe survey sheets are ncluded in appendices. (Author/JN) R oductioni supplie *, from by EDRS are the best that can be mad...|$|E
2500|$|This {{coastal zone}} {{is ideal for}} studies of land-ocean {{interactions}} and coastal physical <b>oceanography.</b> <b>Estuarine</b> circulation from Barkley Sound {{is influenced by the}} shelf dynamics of an eastern boundary current, creating a complex physical environment. Surface outflow drives a deep water inflow which is strongly influenced by upwelling and downwelling conditions on the nearby continental shelf. The nutrient-rich, terrestrial freshwater discharge and the nutrient-rich, cool, salty upwelled water support a diverse and abundant ecosystem ...|$|R
50|$|HBOI {{research}} and education focuses on biological <b>oceanography,</b> <b>estuarine</b> to deep sea ecology, aquaculture, discovery and development of natural products for medicines and other uses, and ocean engineering. Its staff includes more than 160 scientists, engineers, mariners, and support personnel. Funding sources include grants and Florida state educational and general funds, Florida specialty license plates, donations, and other institutional support. Institute assets include the Johnson Sea Link submersible, capable of reaching more than a half-mile under the ocean, and libraries of marine sponges and microbial creatures numbering {{in the tens of}} thousands.|$|R
40|$|With {{the purpose}} of obtaining data which could be useful for {{complementing}} investigations on <b>estuarine</b> biological <b>oceanography,</b> the authors carried out a survey on the distribution and volume of catch produced by fish-traps used by traditional fishermen in the lagoon region of Cananéia-Iguape (São Paulo, Brasil), mainly for catching mullet. As many as 170 fish-traps were initially spotted and mapped in the whole region, {{some of which are}} concentrated in particular areas that seem to be points of more freauent passage of mullet and other fishes, according to the experience and observations of regional fishermen. In consequence of the dam recently built on the Valo Grande - an artificial canal conich formerly linked the RibeiraRiver to the lagoon system of Cananéia-Iguape - it is expected that the sea-water circulation within the lagoon will be intensified, with a consequent increase in the salinity rates of its waters, which in turn will probably affect the ecological balance of time. The authors suggest that a continuous monitoring of the volume and composition of the commercial catch produced by the fish-traps operating in the lagoon-region could eventually offer useful data for detecting the alterations of distribution of the several different fish species that are found in the lagoon, in consequence of the foreseen changes in the salinity rates of its waters...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} oceanography and chlorophyll distribution in Willapa Bay and the adjacent coastal ocean were measured during an upwelling–downwelling wind cycle in late May 1999. Coastal conditions were determined shipboard during {{two sets of}} five cross-shelf transects conducted 4 d apart, and instrument moorings simultaneously recorded wind velocity in the nearshore zone and biophysical water properties within Willapa Bay. The results demonstrate that <b>estuarine</b> physical <b>oceanography</b> and chlorophyll concentrations were determined by processes occurring in the nearshore ocean, and these in turn were forced by variation in wind stress. At {{the start of the}} study period, southerly winds produced downwelling conditions that forced the Columbia River plume against the coast, and low salinity water was advected into Willapa Bay. This water was relatively low in chlorophyll (, 2 mg m 23). As the winds switched to an equatorward direction, coastal upwelling ensued and the Columbia plume was replaced by cold, salty water nearshore. A phytoplankton bloom exceeding 10 mg m 23 was generated on the shelf with its core located 10 to 40 km from the estuarine mouth. The upwelling-favorable winds then relaxed, and the bloom was apparently advected across the shelf to the coast and subsequently into Willapa Bay, where instruments recorded pulses of chlorophyll entering the estuary on flood tides. Weak downwelling conditions were prevalent for the next several days, and the Columbia River plume returned to the coast where it mixed with the chlorophyll-enriche...|$|R
