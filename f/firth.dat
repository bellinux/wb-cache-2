50|$|The ferry crossed between North and South Kessock at the narrows {{between the}} Moray and Beauly <b>Firths.</b> This {{was the first}} of three <b>firths</b> north of Inverness, and the ferry {{provided}} a vital service for the local farming community wishing to sell their produce in Inverness. Along with the Cromarty and Dornoch <b>firths,</b> the narrows at Kessock have been bridged by the A9.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Firths</b> {{are similar}} to fjords, but are {{generally}} shallower with broader bays in which small islands may be found. [...] The glaciers that formed them influenced the land over a wider area and scraped away larger areas. [...] <b>Firths</b> {{are to be found}} mostly on the Scottish and northern English coasts. Individual islands in the <b>firths,</b> or islands and the coast, are often joined up by sandbars or spits made up of sand deposits known as [...] "tombolos".|$|R

5|$|It is {{estimated}} that 11.5 GW of onshore wind potential exists, enough to provide 45 TWh of energy. More than double this amount exists on offshore sites where mean wind speeds are greater than on land. The total offshore potential {{is estimated}} at 25 GW, which although more expensive to install, could be enough to provide almost half the total energy used in Scotland. Plans to harness up to 4.8 GW of the potential in the inner Moray <b>Firth</b> and <b>Firth</b> of Forth were announced in January 2010. Moray Offshore Renewables and SeaGreen Wind Energy were awarded development contracts by the Crown Estate {{as part of a}} UK-wide initiative. Also in 2010, discussions were held between the Scottish Government and Statoil of Norway with a view to developing a 5-turbine floating windfarm, possibly to be located off Fraserburgh. In July 2016, RSPB challenged development in the <b>Firth</b> of Forth and <b>Firth</b> of Tay.|$|E
