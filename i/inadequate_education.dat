As Honduras {{and the international community}} work together to address these hurdles, Honduras will improve water supplies, quality of water, efficiency in irrigation, important freshwater wildlife habitats, and reduce annual flood damage.|$|E

Watts emphasized moral absolutes and was considered in line with Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich's agenda, the Contract with America, and at the time was the only African-American who did not join the Congressional Black Caucus. He initially supported ending affirmative action, declaring <b>inadequate</b> <b>education</b> the main obstacle for racial equality, but subsequently opposed legislation banning the practice for the federal government. Watts focused on promoting his party, attending NAACP meetings and meeting with representatives from historically black colleges. In 1995, Watts was named national co-chairman for the presidential campaign of Republican Bob Dole.|$|E
40|$|The teacher’s {{attitude}} on teaching in addition of teacher’s formal education {{is an important}} factor which affects the quality of the learning outcome. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine how teacher perceive the Home Economics subject - both those who have the appropriate formal education to teach Home Economics subject as well as others. The research was conducted among 57 teachers with adequate and 32 teachers with <b>inadequate</b> formal <b>education</b> to teach the Home Economics subject. The results showed that both, teachers with adequate and teacher with <b>inadequate</b> formal <b>education</b> perceived the Home Economics subject as a less demanding subject. With this statement a little more agreed teacher with <b>inadequate</b> formal <b>education.</b> With statement that Home Economics subject is important for personal and also professional life more agreed teachers with adequate formal education (Home Economics teachers). Awareness of the importance of teaching content for individual well-being is certainly an important factor for the quality of teaching. Currently, the law allows that Home Economics subjects teach also teachers with <b>inadequate</b> formal <b>education.</b> In the future, it would be sensible to think about the possibility of providing teaching this topics to teacher which are trained to teach Home Economics subject content...|$|R

25|$|When she was thirteen, Schröter and {{her family}} moved to Leipzig. It was there that she caught the {{attention}} of composer Johann Adam Hiller (it is thought that Hiller's wife was Corona's godmother). Hiller, an operatic and singspiel composer, had become seriously frustrated with the <b>inadequate</b> <b>education</b> offered to women. To remedy this, in 1771 Hiller opened his own school. In this coeducational setting, students learned a wide variety of musical subjects, including solfège, diction, technique, Italian, and the keyboard. Schröter flourished as a singer, and benefited from the non-damaging technique she learned. Corona was a powerful performer, but was often compared to her fellow student and rival, Gertrud Schmeling (Madame Mara) in Hiller's Grosse Konzerte series. Schröter's voice was not as powerful as Schmeling's, due to her poor early training. However, she had an intensity which her admirers considered to be unrivaled.|$|E
500|$|In 1979, Cunningham Elementary School had 436 students, {{well over}} its {{original}} capacity of 300. 75.5% {{of them were}} White, 14% qualified for free lunch, and 15% qualified for reduced cost lunch. Due to the increasing population and the sudden conversion of adults-only complexes to family oriented, Cunningham Elementary School became overcrowded by 1986 with its enrollment increasing from around 500 in 1985 to more than 900 the next year. By 1988, Gordon Elementary School, a campus in Bellaire, Texas, re-opened {{to serve as a}} reliever school to Cunningham and to a non-Gulfton school. By September 3 of that year, 1,268 students were enrolled at Cunningham; 72% were classified as Hispanic and 99% were on free or reduced-cost lunch programs. Many of the children arrived from Central American countries experiencing civil strife, and therefore many had received an <b>inadequate</b> <b>education</b> prior to coming to the United States. In 1989, Cunningham's overcrowding was described as being [...] "unanticipated." [...] In 1988 the U.S. federal government passed the Fair Housing Act, which, under most circumstances, prohibits any policy that excludes families with children from living in an apartment complex. Abbe Boring, the principal of Cunningham in 1992, said that the student population increased when formerly singles-only apartments were required to allow families to rent complexes. In September 1991 Braeburn and Cunningham were two of 32 HISD schools that had capped enrollments; in other words the schools were filled to capacity and excess students had to attend other schools. By 1992, Cunningham had around 1,200 students and 51 temporary classroom units. Immediately prior to the opening of Benavidez, Cunningham had 1,400 students.|$|E

50|$|Women {{participated in}} this debate by writing poems, conduct books, novels, children’s literature, and plays that {{addressed}} women’s issues specifically, namely {{the need for a}} good education, legal status, and the ability to be economically independent. Thus, the reading material of women became a political topic. Novels such as Modern Philosophers played a large role in this debate, since they were widely read and easily available. Discussion about women’s rights took place in novels because the genre itself was perceived as feminine and it was the most accessible kind of literature to women. Women were supposedly more receptive to fiction than men because of the small purview of their lives. Loyalists such as Hannah More argued that this was because “there is a different bent of understanding in the sexes” while Jacobins such as Wollstonecraft argued that “there is no sex in the soul or mind” and women were only limited by their <b>inadequate</b> <b>educations.</b> Hamilton herself occupied a middle ground, arguing that women were capable of achieving more than they currently did but that their poor education held them back. Unlike the English Jacobins, however, she believed that women should only participate in the domestic sphere. Hamilton’s novel argues for moderate reform, reform based on middle-class morality and Christianity.|$|R
