The classical inscriptions can be arranged in two groups according to the height of the lines (10-12 mm vs. 15 mm); this corresponds to the natural disposition of the veins on the banana stem (on average 10 mm in the lower part of a medium-sized tree) or on the banana leaf (...maximum 15mm).

5000|$|The {{lower part}} of the reliquary with <b>fluted</b> <b>surface,</b> carination and small stem and foot is {{extremely}} similar to the [...] "drinking goblets" [...] that have been found in good numbers mainly in Gandhara (Taxila) and Kapisa (Kapisi). The {{lower part of}} the reliquary resembles the ceremonial drinking cups depicted in ancient Gandharan art and culture relief. Gandharan art of Bacchanalian or Dionysiac drinking scenes are the motifs which represent assimilation of local folk traditions of remote river valleys of the Kafiristan where viticulture and wine festivals are known to have been widely practiced. Similar customs are also well documented in recent times in the region of Nuristan (pre-Islamic Kafiristan) which area had formed integral parts of ancient Kapisa. Bajaur, the presumed provenance of the silver reliquary, was part of the ancient Kapisa. In this very region of Kafiristan or ancient Kapisa, the heirloom silver wine cups [...] with features very similar to those of old Gandhara and Kapisa goblets are still found and before the Islamization of Kafiristan, these silver wine cups were important ritual objects and symbols of social status. Martha Carter associates the well attested wine festival tradition of the valleys of Hindukush with Dionysiac scenes in Gandharan art in general and heirloom silver cups of the modern Nuristanis with Gandharan goblets in particular which is quite persuasive.|$|E
5000|$|The Mark V action {{remained}} relatively unchanged {{during the first}} five years of production. Shortly after, manufacturing moved from PFI in the U.S. to J. P. Sauer in Germany. In addition, the safety was redesigned and moved from the receiver to the bolt, which was changed from a smooth to a <b>fluted</b> <b>surface.</b> The first major change came in 1963 when Weatherby designed a shorter and more trim Mark V action for their 224 Weatherby Magnum varmint round, new for 1964. The bolt in this smaller Mark V action only had six locking lugs, versus the nine found on its bigger brother. Rifles chambered for the new 224 Wby Magnum were dubbed [...] "Varmintmaster." [...] The Varmintmaster was later offered in 22-250 Remington, making this the first non-Weatherby cartridge offered in the Mark V. In 1967, the 9-lug Mark V action was offered for the first time in 30-06. These two cartridges, the 30-06 and 22-250, remained the only two non-Weatherby chamberings offered in production Mark V rifles until the mid-1990s. (Though Weatherby would build a custom Mark V to a customer's specifications in virtually any caliber.) Today, all non-Weatherby standard calibers (not magnum cartridges) are only offered in 6-lug versions of the action. This makes 9-lug, 30-06 Mark Vs (whether made in Germany or Japan) somewhat of a rarity.|$|E

Fláajökull was stationary or advanced slightly between 1966 and 1995 and formed a prominent end moraine. Glacial retreat since then has revealed a cluster of 15 drumlins. This study focuses on the morphology and sedimentology of the drumlins. They are 100 – 600 m long, 40 – 130 m wide, and have cores of glaciofluvial sediment or till. The drumlins are draped by ~ 1 m thick, massive subglacial traction till. The glacier forefield {{is characterized by a}} number of arcuate and saw-tooth, terminal and recessional moraine ridges, overridden moraines with <b>fluted</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and glaciofluvial outwash. Some of the drumlins extend towards the 1995 end moraine but terminate abruptly at the moraine and are not observed in front of it. This suggests that they were formed sub-marginally during the 1966 – 1995 terminal position. The sedimentary structure of the drumlins is best explained by the sticky spot model. Dating and dendrochronological analyses of birch logs found on the surface of one of the drumlins indicate that the valley was forested about 2100 calendar year BP, after which the glacier started to reform, possibly due to an abrupt change in climate...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates early Paleo-Indian {{expansion}} into Saskatchewan as {{reflected by the}} distribution of fluted projectile points compared to Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene environmental changes. With an assemblage consisting solely of <b>fluted</b> point <b>surface</b> finds, this study consists of a geographic distribution analysis. An initial study of Saskatchewan’s fluted projectile points, conducted in 1966 by Tom Kehoe, made use of information from the then known database, consisting of a mere 36 artifacts. The current study examines the modern database of 78 specimens and discusses the distributions of the three separate types of fluted points found in Saskatchewan and the validity of applying terms (Clovis, Folsom, and Northwestern) derived outside the province to them. Not only does Saskatchewan’s assemblage reflect distributional differences between each fluted point type {{as a result of}} late Pleistocene/early Holocene environmental changes, but it shows typological similarities to assemblages elsewhere and changes in a time progressive manner...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of film condensation on a vertical fluted tube {{has been made}} considering gravitational and surface tension effects over the entire <b>fluted</b> <b>surface,</b> and using surface-oriented coordinates. For the first time surface tension effects are determined, as they should, from {{the shape of the}} condensate-vapor interface rather than the shape of the flute. Two-dimensional conduction within the condensate film {{as well as in the}} fluted tube is considered. A finite-difference solution of the highly non-linear partial differential equation for the film thickness is coupled with a finite-element solution of the conduction problem. The procedure has been tested on a sinusoidal flute with amplitude to pitch ratio ~ 0. 2 A linear extrapolation, on a log-log basis, of our results shows good comparison with experimental data.

40|$|The {{subglacial}} processes at Briksdalsbreen, Norway, {{are examined}} {{by a combination}} of sedimentology, thin section and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis of till samples from an exposed subglacial surface and from beneath the glacier. Studies of a <b>fluted</b> <b>surface</b> indicate that subglacial deformation is occurring on a field scale with flutes forming behind most clasts 0 · 6 m high. At the thin section scale (0 · 014 – 2 · 0 mm) it is seen that deformation is by rotation and attenuation and is dependent on till texture. At the SEM scale (0 · 1 – 0 · 4 mm) it is seen that erosion is controlled by abrasion and percussion which produces distinct grain ‘styles’ as part of an erosional continuum. Overall it is shown that rotation and attenuation is a dominant process at all scales and that the clast interactions associated with different scale perturbations within the shear zone control erosion and deposition, as well as landform and fabric production...|$|E
40|$|A 1 : 4000 scale {{map of the}} {{terrestrial}} margins of the foreland of Nordenskiöldbreen depicts a polythermal glacial landsystem containing {{a record of the}} landform signatures of individual ice flow units that operate within the glacier snout. A 1 : 700 map provides a detailed overview of fluted terrain, based on unmanned aerial vehicle images captured in 2014. The pattern of landforms lying inside the Little Ice Age (LIA) latero-frontal moraine on the northern side of the fjord comprises a fluted till surface, which in turn grades into ice-moulded bedrock. This signature records the recession of a single, wide ice flow unit, which was characterised by limited incorporation of subglacial material and restricted delivery of supraglacial debris. Inside the latero-frontal moraine {{on the south side of}} the fjord, a <b>fluted</b> <b>surface</b> is subordinate to a pronounced and large ice-cored moraine complex related to the confluence of five narrower ice flow units, each of which transported significant quantities of englacial and supraglacial debris at their suture zones as a series of longitudinal debris stripes. The suite of foreland landforms is diagnostic of both temperate subglacial and frozen-snout conditions, indicating the operation of a warm polythermal glacier fed by multiple flow units during the LIA...|$|E
40|$|Gregorig | 1 | 2 numerically {{calculated}} the capillary flow on a <b>fluted</b> condenser <b>surface</b> {{and showed that}} high condensation coef-ficients could be obtained near {{the tips of the}} flutes. Surface-ten-sion-induced pressures drive the liquid condensate off the tip of each flute, thinning the liquid film and thus reducing its thermal resistance. Navabian and Bromley (2) using 16 Gregorig-type flutes per in. were able to attain a value of (/ = 14000 Btu/hr ft 2 F tor the surface transfer coefficient on a horizontal cylinder. It is the purpose of this work to develop an analytical solution for the capillary flow on a finned surface for the case of evapora-tion. The work here thus augments that work presented earlier [3 | in which the "valley flow " region between fins or flutes was ana-lyzed numerically and recommendations for the number of fins per inch were made.

40|$|Ultrasonic/sonic rotary-hammer drill (USRoHD) is {{a recent}} {{addition}} to the collection of apparatuses based on ultrasonic/sonic drill corer (USDC). As described below, the USRoHD has several features, not present in a basic USDC, that increase efficiency and provide some redundancy against partial failure. USDCs and related apparatuses were conceived for boring into, and/or acquiring samples of, rock or other hard, brittle materials of geological interest. They have been described in numerous previous NASA Tech Briefs articles. To recapitulate: A USDC {{can be characterized as}} a lightweight, lowpower, piezoelectrically driven jackhammer in which ultrasonic and sonic vibrations are generated and coupled to a tool bit. A basic USDC includes a piezoelectric stack, an ultrasonic transducer horn connected to the stack, a free mass (free {{in the sense that it}} can bounce axially a short distance between hard stops on the horn and the bit), and a tool bit. The piezoelectric stack creates ultrasonic vibrations that are mechanically amplified by the horn. The bouncing of the free mass between the hard stops generates the sonic vibrations. The combination of ultrasonic and sonic vibrations gives rise to a hammering action (and a resulting chiseling action at the tip of the tool bit) that is more effective for drilling than is the microhammering action of ultrasonic vibrations alone. The hammering and chiseling actions are so effective that unlike in conventional twist drilling, little applied axial force is needed to make the apparatus advance into the material of interest. There are numerous potential applications for USDCs and related apparatuses in geological exploration on Earth and on remote planets. In early USDC experiments, it was observed that accumulation of cuttings in a drilled hole causes the rate of penetration of the USDC to decrease steeply with depth, and that the rate of penetration can be increased by removing the cuttings. The USRoHD concept provides for removal of cuttings in the same manner as that of a twist drill: An USRoHD includes a USDC and a motor with gearhead (see figure). The USDC provides the bit hammering and the motor provides the bit rotation. Like a twist drill bit, the shank of the tool bit of the USRoHD is fluted. As in the operation of a twist drill, the rotation of the fluted drill bit removes cuttings from the drilled hole. The USRoHD tool bit is tipped with a replaceable crown having cutting teeth on its front surface. The teeth are shaped to promote fracturing of the rock face through a combination of hammering and rotation of the tool bit. Helical channels on the outer cylindrical surface of the crown serve as a continuation of the <b>fluted</b> <b>surface</b> of the shank, helping to remove cuttings. In the event of a failure of the USDC, the USRoHD can continue to operate with reduced efficiency as a twist drill. Similarly, in the event of a failure of the gearmotor, the USRoHD can continue to operate with reduced efficiency as a USDC...|$|E
