40|$|OBJECTIVEdChildren {{and adults}} with type 1 {{diabetes}} who receive insulin pump therapy have reported hypoglycemia during air travel. We studied the effects of atmospheric pressure on insulin <b>pump</b> <b>delivery.</b> RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODSdTen insulin pumpswere connected to capillary tubes. The effects of changes in ambient pressure on insulin delivery, bubble formation, bubble size, and cartridge plunger movement were analyzed. RESULTSdDuring a flight (200 mmHg pressure decrease), excess insulin delivery of 0. 623 % of the cartridge volume occurred (P, 0. 001, Student t test). In hypobaric chamber studies, bubbles developed in the insulin when the pressure decreased and displaced the insulin out of the cartridge. Pre-existing bubbles changed in size consistent with Boyle law. Cartridge plunger movement did not occur in normal flight conditions but did occur when catastrophic plane depressurization was mimicked. CONCLUSIONSdAtmospheric pressure reduction causes predictable, unintended insulin <b>delivery</b> in <b>pumps</b> by bubble formation and expansion of existing bubbles. A 10 -year-old girl with well-controlled{{type 1 diabetes}} managed with in-sulin pump therapy developed re-current hypoglycemia 60 to 90 min after commencing commercial air travel. Upon direct inquiry, we are now aware of 50 children and adults using insulin pumps who experience this phenomenon. In 1994, Aanderud et al.
