This problem was first alluded to in 1958 in public talks that mentioned Zeus' inability to discriminate targets. If the decoys spread apart further than the lethal radius of the Zeus' warhead, several interceptors {{will be required to}} guarantee that the warhead hiding among the decoys will be destroyed. Decoys are lightweight, and would slow down when they began to reenter the upper atmosphere, allowing them to be picked out, or decluttered. But by that time <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> close to the Zeus base that there might not be time for the Zeus to climb to altitude.|$|E

Many things were rumored about the mile-high designs, such as that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> high the top would freeze at night, helicopters would be used for construction, parachutes would be part of the fire escape plan, and that an elevator ride to the top would take 12 minutes (multiple transfers would be required) in a typical elevator and five minutes in a high-speed elevator. Adrian Smith denied that he was a part of any of the earlier designs, which had been purported in the media. One source even corrected its article and clarified the misunderstanding.|$|E

500|$|Her ice castle, {{which she}} creates while singing [...] "Let It Go", was {{designed}} to illustrate the maturing of her powers {{as well as to}} be [...] "a manifestation of her feelings to the world". The palace is initially beautiful; however, after she is made aware of the destruction she has inadvertently caused, and as she is increasingly vilified and hunted by others, it becomes darker and more distorted, with jagged icicles forming on the walls. The film's design team was uncertain about how it should look and drew out designs for various ice castles filled with snow. Lasseter suggested basing the structure and patterns on snowflakes. For example, an enormous snowflake would serve as the foundation, and the palace would be hexagon-shaped. Lasseter also wanted snowflake patterns to influence the manner in which Elsa creates the palace. [...] "Snowflakes are these tiny little ice crystals that form in mid-air. And when there are changes in temperature and humidity, these snowflakes start growing in a pattern that's known as branching and plating," [...] said co-effects supervisor Dale Mayeda. [...] " [...] said 'You know, when Elsa builds her ice palace, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> amazing if—every step of the way as this castle forms out of thin air—it's just branching and plating, branching and plating all along the way." ...|$|E
500|$|Scream was {{a turning}} point in terms of casting for the horror genre, which {{normally}} involved relatively unknown actors. The genre was considered unsuitable for bigger names as the films had lower budgets and often attained negative critical response. Drew Barrymore read the script and was interested in being involved. She approached the production team herself to request a role. Barrymore, a member of the Barrymore family of actors and granddaughter of actor John Barrymore, had become a star in her own right following her appearance in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). The producers were quick to take advantage of her unexpected interest, and signed her to play the lead role of Sidney Prescott. [...] Her involvement was believed to be instrumental in attracting other popular actors to the film in spite of its smaller budget, and in causing Craven to reconsider his decision to direct the film. [...] Before filming began, Barrymore was faced with unexpected commitments that meant she would no longer be available to play the demanding lead role. She instead played the smaller role of Casey Becker, which allowed her to remain involved and still gave the production the advantage of her stature. Killing off one of their biggest stars early in the film was considered a calculated risk, but it was believed that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> shocking and unexpected that the audience would then believe that any character could die. Actresses including Alicia Witt and Brittany Murphy auditioned for the lead role of Sidney; the producers also approached Reese Witherspoon, though she never auditioned. Craven had seen Neve Campbell in the TV show Party of Five and asked her to audition for the part. He believed she could portray a character who was [...] "innocent", but who could also realistically handle herself while dealing with the physical conflict and emotions required by the role. Campbell was initially reluctant to perform in another horror film so soon after her supporting role in The Craft. After a successful audition, Campbell accepted an offer to play the lead character. She accepted because Scream would be her first leading role, and because she adored the character, saying [...] "She's a fantastic character for any kind of movie." ...|$|E

Abbé Gingras entreated his friend and colleague the vicar-general of Quebec, Abbé Charles-Félix Cazeau, to have Brasseur de Bourbourg assigned to a job in the seminary there.

2500|$|After Toole's death, Thelma Toole became {{mired in}} {{depression}} {{for two years}} and the manuscript for Dunces remained atop an armoire in his former room. She then became determined to have it published, believing it would be an opportunity to prove her son's talent. Over a five-year period, she sent it out to seven publishers and they each rejected it. [...] "Each time it came back I died a little," [...] she said. However, in 1976 she became aware that author Walker Percy was becoming a faculty member at Loyola University New Orleans. Thelma began a campaign of phone calls and letters to Percy to get him to read the manuscript. He even began complaining to his wife about a peculiar old woman's attempts to contact him. With time running out on his term as professor, Thelma pushed her way into his office and demanded he read the manuscript. Initially hesitant, Percy agreed to read the book to stop her badgering. He admitted to hoping <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> bad that he could discard it after reading a few pages. Ultimately, he loved the book, commenting in disbelief: ...|$|E

2500|$|Grace Cathedral was {{initially}} a Bishop's Church {{and not a}} parish church, although Bishop Lee had hoped that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so,</b> possibly uniting with Trinity Church. The bishop was nominally in charge and he had an Assistant in Charge to oversee the day-to-day workings of the cathedral. [...] The following clergy fulfilled that roll: Rev. Horatio N. Powers, 1865-1869; Rev. Hale Townsend, 1865-1872; Rev. R. D. Brooke, 1869-1873; Rev. Edward Lounsbery, 1870-1874; Rev. Joseph S. Jenckes, 1875-1877. [...] The Rt. Rev. William Stevens Perry, Lee's successor as Bishop of Iowa, implemented the cathedral organization on April 1, 1877. Bishop Perry appointed a Dean and Chapter based on the English model. The Chapter {{was made up of}} the following officials: Praecentor, Chancellor, Treasurer, Canons, Rural Deans, and Honorary Prebends. Not all of these offices were functional, not all of them were filled all the time, and the dean actually functioned like a parish vicar. The Very Rev. Dr. Willis H. Barris was appointed as the cathedral's first Dean, and the Rev. Joseph S. Jenches, Jr. was appointed the first canon. [...] The Rev. Charles R. Hale replaced Dean Barris in 1886. [...] Hale was elected Assistant-Bishop of Springfield, Illinois and he was succeeded by the Rev. Hamilton Schuyler in 1896.|$|E

2500|$|Finch {{was coming}} {{to the end of}} a course of the {{antidepressant}} drug Effexor on a reduced dose when he ended his own life unseen on a rainy Saturday afternoon. He left his leather briefcase against the pedestrian walkway railing mid-span of the Golden Gate Bridge. His office desk contained several suicide notes but his death was not confirmed until his body was found nearly six weeks later, seven miles out to sea, near Pillar Point Harbor, about 25 miles south of the bridge from which he jumped. The coroner described his body as [...] "intact but unrecognisable". Many of his friends and colleagues were deeply shocked by his death but his close friends were not surprised by his cinematic ending. His eulogist, Jenni Olson, summed it up: [...] "Of course, given his personality, I just thought, 'Oh, how Mark' that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> spectacular. He doesn't do anything in a small way." [...] A memorial service was held at the Castro Theatre on 26 February 1995, and the 19th San Francisco Festival was dedicated to Finch's memory. A special fund was established in his name [...] "to help support the work of emerging queer filmmakers". Ten years after his death Olson made a film, The Joy of Life, of which the second half addresses his suicide and the part played in it by the Golden Gate Bridge.|$|E
