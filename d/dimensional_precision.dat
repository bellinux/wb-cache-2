We assessed the poten-tial benefits of augmented endoscopy derived from this system for use during skull base navigation. Specifically, we wished to evaluate target localization accuracy and the effect on task workload and confidence. Study Design: Prospective, sequential, paired preclinical trial. Methods: A single cadaver head underwent computed tomography, and critical structures were contoured. The speci-men was reimaged after endoscopic dissection and deformable registration allowed contours to be displayed on postablation CBCT imaging. A real-time virtual view including anatomical contours was provided parallel to the real endoscopic image. Twelve {{subjects were asked to}} endoscopically localize seven skull base landmarks in a conventional manner. The same exer-cise was then performed with augmented endoscopy. Precise three-dimensional (3 D) localization was recorded with a tracked probe. The NASA task load index was completed after each exercise. A short questionnaire was also administered. Results: The real-time augmented image guidance system aided localization in 85 % of responses and increased confi-dence in 97 %.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{measuring}} the nonlinearity of laser interferometer using optical frequency tuning technique is presented in this paper. The basic principle of this method {{is to make the}} fractional part of an interference fringe change by tuning the laser frequency and determining the nonlinearity of interferometer by comparing the fractional fringe change measured by the interferometer to that calculated from the laser frequency change. An experimental interferometric system with a wavelength tunable laser source is set up and the nonlinearity of the interferometer is measured. Since it does not require the precise displacement mechanism to produce the optical path difference change, this method is more convenient to use and may achieve a higher accuracy than the conventional measurement methods. The nonlinearity of the arbitrary interferometric phase can be measured by changing the laser frequency with this method. Experiments results have shown that the repeatability of nonlinearity measurement is less than 0. 2 nm.
