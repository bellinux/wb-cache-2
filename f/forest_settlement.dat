It struck him his invaders might have quietly taken possession of the houses, or even have stolen his horses and decamped. In this direction, then, he and his son proceeded, using the greatest caution in their movements, and occasionally stopping to examine the waning fires at the rock, or to throw a glance behind them at the stockade. Everything remained in the quiet which renders a <b>forest</b> <b>settlement</b> so solemn and imposing, after the daily movements of man have ceased. The deepest and most breathless attention could not catch an unaccustomed sound. Even the bark of a dog was not heard, all those useful animals having followed their masters into the Hut, as if conscious that their principal care now lay in that direction. Each of the sentinels had one of these animals near him, crouched under the stockade, in the expectation of their giving the alarm, should any strange footstep approach. In this manner most of the distance between the Knoll and the forest was crossed, when the major suddenly laid a hand on his father's arm.|$|E

50|$|Reserved Forest {{is an area}} mass of land duly {{notified}} {{under the}} provisions of India Forest Act or the State Forest Acts having full degree of protection. In Reserved Forests all activities are prohibited unless permitted. Reserved Forest is notified under section 20 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927 16 of 1927 or under the reservation provisions of the Forest acts of the Governments of the Indian Union. The manner in which a Forest, shortly written as RF, has to be constituted is described in section 3 to 20 of the Act. It is within power of a State Government to issue a preliminary notification under section 4 of the Act declaring {{that it has been}} decided to constitute such land, as specified in a Schedule with details of its location, area and boundary description, into a Reserved Forest. such a notification also appoints an officer of the State Government, normally the Deputy Commissioner of the concerned district, as <b>Forest</b> <b>Settlement</b> Officer. The <b>Forest</b> <b>Settlement</b> Officer fixes a period not less than three months, to hear the claims and objections of every person having or claiming any rights over the land which is so notified to be reserved. He conducts inquiries into the claims of rights, and may reject or accept the same. He is empowered even to acquire land over which right is claimed. For rights other than that of right of way, right of pasture, right to forest produce, or right to a water course, the <b>Forest</b> <b>Settlement</b> Officer may exclude such land in whole or in part, or come to an agreement with the owner for surrender of his rights, or proceed to acquire such land in the manner prescribed under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 1 of 1894.

The studied <b>forest</b> <b>settlements</b> were: Pinus sp. (PP), Eucalyptus sp. (PE), Hevea brasiliensis (PHB), and native forest (PNF). The mean annual precipitation and temperature for the region are 1493 mm and 19. 3 °C, respectively. For each studied settlement, disturbed and undisturbed samples from 0 - 5 cm depth were collected. The studied physical attributes were: aggregates stability, expressed through geometric average diameter, porosity distribution, penetration resistance and permeability. The PNF revealed the highest permeability value (139 mm h- 1), followed by PHB (57 mm h- 1), PP and PE (40 mm h- 1). The highest value for penetration resistance was verified for PP, followed by PE and PHB. The smallest value was presented by PNF.
