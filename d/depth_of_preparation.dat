A portable computer-aided educational system with advanced digital image processing capabilities would be less expensive than current computer-aided dental educational systems and would also address some of their limitations. This dissertation outlines the development of novel components that would be part of such a system. This research includes the design of a novel image processing technique, the Directed Active Shape Model algorithm, which is used to locate the tooth and drilled preparation from a digital image, and also to measure the exact size, shape and location <b>of</b> the drilled <b>preparation</b> in relation to the expected <b>preparation.</b> The use <b>of</b> statistical measures taken from the digital images to provide feedback about the smoothness and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the dental <b>preparation</b> is also detailed.

Maintaining proper posture is critical for dental practitioners, because poor posture can affect not only the dental practitioner 2 ̆ 7 s health, but also the quality of the practitioner 2 ̆ 7 s work. The algorithms and techniques designed for use in the dental education support system could also be applied in the design of computer-aided educational systems for the development of procedural skills in many other fields, and in the design of systems to support practicing dentists...|$|R

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A sample (n= 100) of laboratory models containing 208 tooth preparations for IPS Empress and In Ceram, featuring work from different GDPs, was obtained from 8 commercial dental laboratories. Aspects <b>of</b> <b>preparations</b> were quantified and compared with accepted criteria defined following {{a review of the literature}} and recommendations of the manufactures' guidelines. RESULTS: Subgingival margins on the buccal aspect were noticed in 36 % <b>of</b> the <b>preparations,</b> 54 % demonstrated overpreparation with a tendency to overprepare the teeth on the mesiodistal plane more than buccolingual plane. Twenty percent of samples presented a shoulder finish line while a chamfer margin design was noticed in 39 %.

40|$|The {{rapidly growing}} {{cultural}} diversity of school children {{is an international}} trend that {{has been accompanied by}} concerns that teacher education programmes are not adequately preparing pre-service teachers for culturally diverse classrooms. This qualitative instrumental case study was conducted to gain deep insights into how one teacher education programme at a New Zealand university prepared pre-service teachers for cultural diversity. The study was conceptualised, conducted and analysed through a critical constructivist lens and underpinned by Vygotskian sociocultural theory. The primary research question asked: In what ways are New Zealand pre-service teachers prepared to meet the learning needs of students in culturally diverse classrooms? The question was explored on four levels: Curriculum, pedagogy, perceptions of effectiveness and diversity capacity. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews, observation, document analysis and field notes and were thematically analysed and interpreted through deductive and inductive coding. Results were reported thematically and reflected multiple layers of meaning and interpretations emphasising the complexity of the issue. Key curriculum findings revealed variability in the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> pre-service teacher <b>preparation</b> for cultural diversity and a predominantly conceptual development of sociocultural competence. The pedagogical findings reported on three types of pedagogical activity, namely dialogic activity, monologic activity and reflective activity and four types of social relationships, namely expert-novice, professional partnership, critical minority and silent minority. Additionally, findings on participant perceptions of effectiveness and on the impact of the teacher’s cultural background on teaching and learning are detailed. The study makes three propositions on how to prepare pre-service teachers for cultural diversity. Limitations of the study and directions for future research are outlined...|$|R

40|$|A common way {{to present}} 3 D {{materials}} to human observers nowadays is by stereoscopic displaying on 3 D TVs or head-mounted displays {{such as the}} Oculus Rift. However, not everyone can see three-dimensional solid shape from stereoscopic viewing and the three-dimensional images remain two-dimensional pictures to them rather than solid shapes. Scientists and artists {{have spent a lot}} of effort in finding ways to dissolve pictorial space into visual space. In other words, they want to figure out how to create a sense of stereopsis in an observer when he or she is looking at non-stereo and stereo pictures. There are many monocular depth cues in addition to binocular disparity that can enhance depth perception, and these cues can therefore also create an impression of stereopsis when the viewing conditions are right. One <b>of</b> these <b>depth</b> cues is <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field. <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> field is defined as the distance range in which objects are perceived as sharp. <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> field is a popular photographic technique that effectively makes the main subject in a picture appear sharp and the foreground and background blurred. The goal of this thesis is to understand the roles <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field in pictures from a relatively low perceptual level to a relatively high cognitive level. This thesis mainly reveals how <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field influences the impression of stereopsis and how binocular disparity influences the perception <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field. I start the thesis with a study on the discrimination thresholds <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field. Then, a subjective study is reported in which I investigated the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on <b>depth</b> perception for binocular viewing. The next two studies address the roles <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on a more cognitive level. The first of these two studies explored the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on change detection in pictures. The other one was conducted to evaluate how <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field influences the aesthetic appeal and overall quality in photographs. Four subjective studies were conducted to achieve our goals. The cornerstone of the work described in this thesis is that humans are much more sensitive to changes in small <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field than in large <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field. A second important finding is that stereoscopic viewing does not significantly affect discrimination thresholds. Based on the discrimination thresholds that were measured in this study, I selected five levels <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field that can be well discriminated under stereo viewing conditions in the second study to explore the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on <b>depth</b> perception. I found that the presence <b>of</b> strong <b>depth</b> cues, in this case binocular disparity, weakens the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field as a depth cue when <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field is small. In contrast, when <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field is not small, perceived depth decreases with increasing <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field irrespective of whether binocular disparity is zero or not. With respect to the effects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on change detection, I found that <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field directs viewers' attention similarly under both non-stereo and stereo viewing conditions. <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> field does however weaken the effect of binocular disparity on change detection. In the final study, I found that there are no common rules on how to manipulate <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field to make pictures more beautiful or have higher quality. The role <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field on aesthetic appeal and overall quality varies across content categories.

A large or deep <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field is generated with a very small iris aperture and focusing on a point in the distance, whereas a shallow <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field will be achieved with a large (open) iris aperture and focusing closer to the lens. <b>Depth</b> <b>of</b> field is also governed by the format size.
