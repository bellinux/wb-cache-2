Hotels exhibit a lower level of development with respect to reviewing required rates of return and also applying postcompletion audits. Also, net present value and internal rate of return, which are based on discounting approaches, are used to a relatively low degree in the hotel industry, and more than half the hotels surveyed either exclusively use the payback method (36 %) or use no <b>financial</b> investment <b>appraisal</b> method at all (17 %).

40|$|For {{over three}} decades, {{negotiated}} planning obligations {{have been the}} primary form of land value capture in England.

This paper assesses {{the extent to which the}} use of <b>financial</b> <b>appraisals</b> has provided a robust, just and practical procedure to support land value capture. It is concluded that development viability appraisals are saturated with intrinsic uncertainty and that land value capture that is based on such calculations is, to some extent, capricious. In addition, clear incentives for developers and land owners to bias viability calculations, the economic dependence of many viability consultants on developers and land owners, a lack of transparency, contested or ambiguous guidance and the opportunities created by input uncertainty for bias are further failings. It is argued that how viability calculations are applied has been, is being and will continue to be shaped by power relations...|$|R

It is planned to involve a private concessionaire for design, construction, operation and maintenance, and the governments of Argentina and Uruguay in supportive roles. The main objectives of this paper are to assess the project from the viewpoint of the concessionaire by the <b>financial</b> <b>appraisal</b> and the governments of Argentina and Uruguay through the economic and stakeholder appraisals. To evaluate the financial viability from the private point of view, we integrate the engineering cost estimates, the traffic forecasting and financing information into a cash flow statement {{over the life of the}} project. Therefore, the <b>financial</b> <b>appraisal</b> draws the estimates of construction and operating costs and sources of supply. The economic appraisal evaluates the project from the viewpoint of the Argentine and Uruguayan economy, respectively. It starts with the <b>financial</b> <b>appraisal</b> of costs and revenues and develops a series of adjustments for the most important externalities to reflect the economic costs and benefits to each of the two countries After applying scenario techniques to assess this investment project, we undertake sensitivity and risk analyses of the financial and economic performance of the bridge project.

40|$|In Scotland, as {{a result}} of recent changes in {{agricultural}} policy and grant schemes, there is now greater potential for planting a wider range of more productive forestry species on better quality land. In order to permit accurate production forecasting and <b>financial</b> <b>appraisals</b> for any such afforestation, it is necessary to develop predictive yield models. This article describes the development of a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of General Yield Class (GYC) of Douglas fir using readily assessed, or derived, site factors. Climate surfaces developed by spatial analysis of weather data were used to predict temperature and rainfall for 87 sample sites to a resolution of 1 km(2). Estimates of wind climate were derived from a regression model using geographic location, elevation and topographic exposure. Multivariate analysis of these and other soil and topographic variables indicate that temperature and exposure are most important in determining the productivity of Douglas fir on better quality sites in Scotland. As crop age increases, GYC declines and the possible reasons for this effect are discussed. Other factors are also discussed, such as the genetic variability of Douglas fir, and problems associated with establishment and form...|$|R
40|$|<b>Financial</b> <b>appraisal</b> is an {{important}} aspect in adopting techniques that reduce the (fossil) energy use of buildings. When <b>financial</b> <b>appraisal</b> of an energy technique takes place, fixed prices for the form and amount of energy are often used and are multiplied by the estimated amount of energy savings. However, after a certain time period an energy bill for the user of a building only partially shows variable prices depending on the form and amount of energy. Many costs mentioned by a common energy bill are time related or {{are related to the}} national political regime. Infrastructural costs depend on the type of connection you have to the grid. These costs form an annual fee. The VAT or additional energy taxes that need to be paid, depends on the political regime and are often expressed in a surcharge in terms of percentage. This paper focus on the differences between marginal and average energy costs and the differences in variable and fixed energy costs. The impact price differences have for the <b>financial</b> <b>appraisal</b> of energy saving techniques for multiple actors is shown by conducting a comparative study on energy bills.

40|$|The UK, {{like many}} other industrialised countries, is {{committed}} to reducing greenhouse gas emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. To achieve this goal the UK is increasingly turning towards wind power {{as a source of}} emissions free energy. However, the variable nature of wind power generation makes it an unreliable energy source, especially at higher rates of penetration. Likewise the aim {{of this paper is to}} measure the potential reduction in wind power variability that could be realised as a result of geographically dispersing the location of wind farm sites. To achieve this aim wind speed data will be used to simulate two scenarios. The first scenario involves locating a total of 2. 7 gigawatts (GW) of wind power capacity in a single location within the UK while the second scenario consists of sharing the same amount of capacity amongst four different locations. A risk portfolio approach as used in <b>financial</b> <b>appraisals</b> is then applied in the second scenario to decide upon the allocation of wind power capacity, amongst the four wind farm sites, that succeeds in minimising overall variability for a given level of wind power generation.

40|$|Estimates {{suggest that}} {{intensified}} silviculture using improved genotypes could raise productivity of existing forests in Britain by 30 per cent, thus reducing reliance upon imported timber. This increase is most readily attainable in upland coniferous forests where Sitka spruce {{is the major}} species. Superior families of Sitka spruce can now be identified with a ten per cent increase in vigour over ordinary seed lots. However, supplies of improved seed will not be available in significant quantities until after 2000. Research into vegetative propagation was begun to speed the introduction of improved material into commerce. Early work on the propagation of superior clones failed because of problems of maturation. Subsequent investigation has concentrated upon propagation of young individuals of improved genotypes grown from seed produced by artificial pollination of tested clones. Techniques for large-scale production of rooted cuttings of these improved genotypes have now been successfully developed. Following favourable <b>financial</b> <b>appraisals,</b> commercial trials of the system are under way. Based on experience with Sitka spruce, three preconditions are proposed for large-scale propagation programmes. These are use of cuttings from young parents, propagation of proven superior genotypes, {{and use of the}} technique with material in short supply. The possible role of vegetative propagation for other commercially important conifers is discussed with only Hybrid larch considered promising.

The multi-parameter damage models FLEMOps (Flood Loss Estimation Model for the private sector) and regression-tree models have been adapted to the information derived from remote sensing data and were applied {{on the basis of the}} urban structure map. To evaluate this approach, which is suitable for risk analyses, as well as for post-disaster event analyses, an estimation of the flood losses caused by the Elbe flood in 2002 was undertaken. The urban structure mapping approach delivered a map with a good accuracy of 74 % and on this basis modeled flood losses for the Elbe flood in 2002 in Dresden were in the same order of magnitude as official damage data. It has been shown that single-family houses suffered significantly higher damages than other urban structure types. Consequently, information on their specific location might significantly improve damage modeling, which indicates a high potential of remote sensing methods to further improve risk assessments...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY This study {{examines}} the decision-making in Finnish industrial companies {{with regard to}} energy efficiency investments. It aims to identify factors that hinder the implementation of energy efficiency investments in industrial sector. The focus is especially on the investment appraisal methods and the investment process participants influencing the investment decision-making. The {{results of this study}} may act as a guide for companies in improving their investment processes to support more equal and comprehensive evaluation among different kind of investments. DATA The research was executed in two phases, firstly, by doing a survey questionnaire and secondly, by conducting follow-up interviews based on the findings received from the survey. Altogether 345 energy efficiency representatives in the Finnish industrial companies received the questionnaire and 107 replied with filled online form resulting in a response rate of 31 %. After statistical analysis, seven people were interviewed in order to gain broader understanding of the findings. RESULTS The findings {{of this study indicate that}} the main reason why investment opportunities become rejected is the investment’s inability to match the financial profitability criteria set for evaluating capital expenditure. The most commonly used <b>financial</b> investment <b>appraisal</b> method for operational and energy efficiency investments is the payback period method followed by the internal rate of return and net present value methods. Strategic investment appraisal methods are still used infrequently. Results indicate that companies that are using sophisticated <b>financial</b> investment <b>appraisal</b> methods and more specifically IRR when evaluating energy efficiency investments go on to implement more energy efficiency investments than other Finnish industrial companies. This study also suggests that having a financial expert involved in the investment process already from the planning stage increases the likelihood that energy efficiency investment will be approved in the decision-making stage. However, Finnish industrial companies’ investment project teams are usually not very versatile and consist mainly of technical experts...|$|R

40|$|The {{integration}} of corporate sustainability within operations remains {{an important and}} fundamental challenge for business. This paper first consolidates and then builds upon the EABIS-supported activities of Cranfield School of Management with business practitioners. It focuses on the performance and evaluation criteria relating to determining corporate responsibility (CR) value. The paper begins by categorising components of CR in terms of decision-making levels and business case requirements. It then describes a methodology for establishing CR issues with the prioritisation of stakeholders before linking this relationship onto business benefits and shareholder value drivers. Using illustrated models and worked examples, sections within the paper provide further practical advice and guidance for developing and populating elements within the framework. Additional sections then complement {{the application of the}} CR Value-chain framework, with a chapter on performance measurement that explores the key performance measure characteristics required to underpin the performance element of the framework. The final chapter describes decision-making support tools, such as <b>financial</b> <b>appraisals</b> and risk evaluations, which also underpin the shareholder value approach and should be integrated within this corporate sustainability value management framework. A key purpose of this approach is to support the {{integration of}} sustainability performance management processes and systems within business practice. It explores methods for making more explicit the issues surrounding CR and financial value. It also provides useful approaches for helping businesses select, measure and evaluate performance for internal CR strategies, policies and processes. Some analytical methods are considered for identifying the costs and benefits from sustainability-related issues, projects and new ventures, including discussions with regard to harmonising existing business functions. This paper serves to provide an early prototype for future approaches towards integrated sustainability performance management systems.
