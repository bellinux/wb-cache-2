40|$|We {{propose a}} simple route to {{evaluate}} the static structure, in terms of average coordination, of completely disordered solids with spherical constituents, from ca. 55 % volume fraction up to random close packing, {{in the absence of}} structural heterogeneities. Based on the current understanding, according to which the structure-determining interaction in amorphous solids is the hard-core repulsion while weaker, longer-range interactions are mere perturbations, the model yields the average coordination in the solid {{as a result of a}} <b>hyperquenching</b> process where the instantaneous structure of the precursor liquid snapshot is distorted to the same degree required to quench the hard-sphere liquid into the isostatic jammed state at 64 % volume fraction. The characteristic length of distortion turns out to be about 3 % of the particle diameter. Extrapolating to lower volume fractions, this is thus the quenching route leading to the most spatially homogeneous states. Thus the model can be usefully employed to quantitatively assess the degree of structural inhomogeneity in amorphous solids. When spatial inhomogeneity is small, as for very dense systems, the model can be used to evaluate coordination-dependent macroscopic properties (e. g. the elastic moduli) as shown in parallel works...|$|R

Knowledge about those processes constitutes {{a source of information}} to development of preparation of liquid metal and control of alloy preparation process within industry.

40|$|We {{review the}} search for the glass {{transition}} in water in its various amorphous forms, and highlight the paradoxes that the search has produced. Focussing on the glassy form of water obtained by hyperquenching, we examine its reported calorimetric properties in the light of new findings for bulk glassformers vitrified by hyperquenching. Like the <b>hyperquenched</b> bulk glassformers, <b>hyperquenched</b> water exhibits a large relaxation exotherm on reheating, as the high enthalpy quenched form relaxes to a lower enthalpy state.

However, when the relaxation exotherm for <b>hyperquenched</b> water is scaled onto the plot for the bulk glassformers using the commonly accepted glass transition temperature for water, 136 K, its behavior appears completely different. If we require that the behavior of water be comparable to the other cases, except for crystallizing before the glass transition (like the majority of <b>hyperquenched</b> metallic glasses), then the glass transition for water must be reset to a value of 165 - 170 K.

Glassy water has previously been prepared by <b>hyperquenching</b> micron-sized droplets of liquid water and vapor deposition on a cold substrate (ASW), and its transformation to an ultraviscous liquid form has been reported on heating.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of observing a glass transition in water before crystallisation occurs has been debated vigorously but inconclusively over five decades [1, 2]. For two decades a glass transition at 136 K [2, 3] was accepted but this transition has perplexing qualities [4]. Recently {{it has been}} argued[2, 5],that this assignment must be wrong. The re-assignment of Tg to temperatures above the 150 K crystallisation was vigorously contested [6]. Here we use detailed anneal-and-scan studies of a <b>hyperquenched</b> inorganic glass, which does not crystallize on heating, to interpret the perplexing aspects of the 136 K water phenomenon. We show that it is indeed linked to a glass transition, though only via a cross-over phenomenon. The thermal history that gives the same behaviour ("shadow" glass transition) in the inorganic glass is linked by crossover to a "normal" glass transition 23 % higher in temperature. Thus a Tg is indeed unobservable for water, while the vitreous nature of <b>hyperquenched</b> glassy water is strongly supported. The shadow Tg is reproducible in the inorganic glass {{as it is in}} H 2 O.

Using a fictive temperature method of obtaining the temperature dependence of enthalpy relaxation, we show that the electrospray method yields quenching rates of ~ 105 K/s, while the more common method, dropping a sealed pan of sample into liquid nitrogen, yields only 120 K/s. <b>Hyperquenched</b> samples start to relax exothermically far below the glass temperature, at a temperature where the thermal energy permits escape from the shallow traps in which the system becomes localized during hyperquenching. This permits estimation of the trap depths, which are then compared with the activation energy estimated from the fictive temperature of the glass and the relaxation time at the fictive temperature. The trap depth in molar energy units is compared with the "height of the landscape" for PG, the quasi-lattice energy of the liquid based on the enthalpy of vaporization, and the single molecule activation energy for diffusion in hydrogen bonded crystals.

The NPHB mechanism was then further elucidated and the concept of intrinsic to glass configurational relaxation processes as pre-mediating step to the hole burning process was introduced. The latter provided the theoretical basis for NPHB to evolve into a powerful tool probing the dynamics and nature of amorphous media, which aside from ''simple'' inorganic glasses may include also ''complex'' biological systems such as living cells and cancerous/normal tissues.

Design/methodology/approach: Powders of the starting materials were wet mixed in the laboratory vibratory ball mill to obtain the uniform distribution of the reinforcement particles in the matrix. The mixed powders were then dried in the air. The components were initially compacted at cold state in a die with the diameter of Ø 26 mm in the laboratory vertical unidirectional press – with a capacity of 350 kN. The selected compacting load was sufficient to obtain prepregs which would not crumble {{and at the same time}} would not be deformed too much, which would also have the adverse effect on their quality, as the excessive air pressure in the closed pores causes breaking the prepreg up when it is taken out from the die. The obtained PM compacts were heated to a temperature of 480 - 500 ˚C and finally extruded – with the extrusion pressure of 500 kN. Some of the composite materials were <b>hyperquenched</b> for 0. 5 h at the temperature of 495 ºC with the subsequent cooling in water, and were quench aged next for 6 h at 200 °C.

The eruption produced floating scoria bombs, or balloons, that discharged gas at the surface and eventually sank to the seafloor. Activity occurred {{for a period of}} one week from an eruptive vent located within the Pantelleria Rift at a water depth of 250 m. ^ Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) video footage and high resolution multibeam mapping of the Foerstner vent site was used to create a geologic map of the 1891 AD deposits and conduct the first detailed study of the source area associated with this unusual type of submarine volcanism. The main Foerstner vent consists of two overlapping circular mounds with a total volume of 6. 3 x 10 5 m 3 and relief of 60 m. It is dominantly constructed of clastic scoriaceous deposits with some interbedded effusive pillow flow deposits. Petrographic and geochemical analyses of Foerstner samples by X-ray fluorescence and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry reveal {{that the majority of the}} deposits are highly to extremely vesicular, hypocrystalline tephrite basanite scoria that display porphyritic, hyaloophitic, and vitrophyric textures. An intact scoria balloon recovered from the seafloor consists of an interior gas cavity surrounded by a thin lava shell comprised of two distinct layers; a thin, oxidized quenched crust surrounding the exterior of the balloon and a dark grey, tachylite layer lying beneath it. Ostwald ripening is determined to be the dominant bubble growth mechanism of four representative Foerstner scoria samples as determined by vesicle size distributions. ^ Characterization of the diversity of deposit facies observed at Foerstner in conjunction with quantitative rock texture analysis indicates that Strombolian-like activity is the most likely mechanism for the formation of buoyant scoria bombs. The deposit facies observed at the main Foerstner vent are very similar to those produced by other known submarine Strombolian eruptions (short pillow flow lobes, large scoriaceous clasts, spatter-like vent facies). Balloons were likely formed from the rapid cooling of extremely vesicular magma fragments as a result of a gas-rich frothy magma source. The exterior of these fragments <b>hyperquenched</b> forming a vesicular glassy shell that acted as an insulating layer preventing magmatic gas in its interior from escaping and thus allowing flotation as densities reached less than 1000 kg/m 3. We believe that lava balloon eruptions are more common than previously thought, as the eruptive conditions required to generate these products are likely to be present in a variety of submarine volcanic environments. Additionally, the facies relationships observed at Foerstner may be used as a paleoenvironmental indicator for modern and ancient basaltic shallow submarine eruptions because of the relatively narrow depth range over which they likely occur (200 - 400 m). ...|$|E
