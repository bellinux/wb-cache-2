40|$|We {{study the}} {{computation}} of the static quark potential under decimations in the Monte Carlo Renormalization Group (MCRG). Employing a multi-representation plaquette action, {{we find that}} fine-tuning the decimation prescription so that the MCRG equilibrium self-consistency condition is satisfied produces dramatic improvement at large distances. In particular, lattice coarsening (change of effective lattice spacing on action-generated lattices after decimation) is nearly <b>eliminated.</b> <b>Failure</b> to correctly tune the decimation, on the other hand, produces large coarsening effects, of order 50 % or more, consistent with those seen in previous studies. We also study rotational invariance restoration at short distances, where no particular improvement is seen for this action. ...|$|E
30|$|Proper {{protection}} {{of information systems}} is a major quality issue of organizational risk management. Risk management is a process whereby risk factors are identified and then virtually <b>eliminated.</b> <b>Failure</b> modes and effects analysis (FMEA) is a risk management methodology for identifying system’s failure modes with their effects and causes. FMEA identifies potential weaknesses in the system. This approach allows companies to correct areas identified through the process before the system fails. In this paper, we identify several critical failure factors that may jeopardize the security of information systems. In doing this, we systematically identify, analyze, and document the possible failure modes and the possible effects of each failure on the system. The proposed cybersecurity FMEA (C-FMEA) process results in {{a detailed description of}} how failures influence the system’s performance and how they can be avoided. The applicability of the proposed C-FMEA is illustrated with an example from a regional airport.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Failure {{mode and}} effect {{analysis}} (FMEA) {{is a widely}} used reliability analysis and risk assessment tool in various industries. It {{is one of the}} most established project management techniques to identify and <b>eliminate</b> <b>failures</b> before actual manufacturing starts. In traditional FMEA, Risk Priority Number (RPN) ranking system is used to evaluate; the risk level of failures, to rank failures, and to prioritize actions. Even through this approach is simple but there are some shortcomings in obtaining a good estimate of the failure ratings. Thus, a new risk assessment system based on the fuzzy set theory and fuzzy rule base theory is proposed to deal with these drawbacks. Furthermore, an analysis of a forging industry is presented to demonstrate the traditional FMEA and the proposed FMEA...|$|R

40|$|The fast {{fracture}} strength distribution of uniaxially ground, alpha silicon carbide was investigated {{as a function}} of grinding angle relative to the principal stress direction in flexure. Both as-ground and ground/annealed surfaces were investigated. The resulting flexural strength distributions were used to verify reliability models and predict the strength distribution of larger plate specimens tested in biaxial flexure. Complete fractography was done on the specimens. Failures occurred from agglomerates, machining cracks, or hybrid flaws that consisted of a machining crack located at a processing agglomerate. Annealing <b>eliminated</b> <b>failures</b> due to machining damage. Reliability analyses were performed using two and three parameter Weibull and Batdorf methodologies.
