Severely injured {{in an accident}} {{a week before the}} executions, Owen reportedly confessed to the bombing on his deathbed by saying, [...] "I was at the Haymarket riot and am an anarchist and say that <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> bomb in that riot." [...] He was an anarchist and apparently had been in Chicago at the time but other accounts note that long before his accident he had said he was at the Haymarket and saw the bomb thrower. Owen may have been trying to save the condemned men.|$|E
500|$|Hualālai last {{erupted in}} 1800–1801. This {{eruption}} produced very fluid alkalic basalt lava flows that entered the ocean off the western tip of Hawaii island. Although five vents were active at the time, only two produced flows that eventually reached the ocean. The total output {{volume of the}} flow is estimated at over [...] One volcanic vent, situated high on the slope, produced a large a'a flow, dubbed the Kaʻūpūlehu flow, that reached the ocean as two distinct lobes. On its way down, it overran a village and a valuable [...] fishing pond. There is a local legend that after the failure of several offerings of animals and other items to the gods, the flow was finally stopped when Kamehameha <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> lock of his own hair into the fire. The Ka'ūpūlehu flow is also known for the particularly large quantity of mafic and ultramafic xenoliths that came up with it.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by film-maker Brett Ratner in Los Angeles, and features a cameo appearance from 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer. Prior to filming the video, or releasing the single, Carey had toned her body, and lost a reported twenty pounds. Due to her slim-down, she and Ratner wanted to flaunt Carey's new figure {{as much as possible}} throughout the video: [...] "Mariah looks better than she has ever looked. It's ridiculous. Mariah has an incredible body, but she was always kind of very voluptuous. Now she's just like, fit. And we were like, we've got to show this body." [...] As the pair came up with the video's plot, Ratner contacted McBrayer to play a male leading role, alongside Carey. After receiving the call, McBrayer claimed he was so shocked by the proposal, that he didn't believe it at first. He only met with the producers after Ratner personally called him and assured him the authenticity of the offer. In an interview with MTV News, McBrayer joked [...] "I'm always worried now that somebody is pranking me, so at first I was very leery. But when I heard it was legit, and then later on we {{got a phone call from}} Brett Ratner, who directed it. I was like, 'This is either a very elaborate prank, or this is the real deal.'" [...] In the fantasy-themed story, he recalled what he considered the video's most memorable scene, in which he and Carey, dressed in medieval attire, were walking with a unicorn. Additionally, he described the filming process as very simple, as they were given very loose directions and pointers. McBrayer claimed that during one take, they were meant to play Frisbee on the mansion lawn, and he accidentally threw it at Carey's face, jokingly adding [...] "by the time she spins back around — bonk, right in her face. <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> Frisbee in Mariah Carey's face! I'm like, I'm fired!." [...] When questioned by critics regarding the song and video, Carey responded [...] "Have you seen the 'Touch My Body' video? C'mon. Clearly you must see the humour in that. Even the lyrics, 'I will hunt you down'. If anyone doesn't get the joke by this time then they are an idiot." [...] In an interview with Reuters, Carey described working with Ratner, and her experience filming the video: ...|$|E

2500|$|In Davidson's first {{autobiography}} The Full Monty (1993), {{he talked}} about his violent and abusive behaviour towards his wife in a light-hearted manner: [...] "We’re like a couple of boxers. On the first occasion, I poked her in the eye by accident. I actually went for the mouth. Thank heaven I missed, I’d have fallen in. I just took a playful punch. Unfortunately I caught her completely wrong. The second time I gave her a shiner. <b>I</b> <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> bunch of keys which whacked her in the eye.

60|$|With what {{strength}} I still possessed I {{went to work}} {{to scale}} her balcony. The task was easy even for one in my spent condition.
