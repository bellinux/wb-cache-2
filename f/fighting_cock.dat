25|$|Brigadier Gen. Kenneth Sweany {{attended}} the summer training in July 1954, expressing satisfaction following the Governor's Day parade that culminated it. On November 19, 1954, the Regular Army formally returned {{the designation of}} 296th Regiment to the PRNG in an activity hosted by Muñoz Marín, this under new administrative personnel due to several former members remaining in active service. Detachments were then assigned to several municipalities. The Regiment was able to gather enough troops, but the officers were scarce due to active service and the Inactive Reserve. Other moves included {{the adoption of a}} <b>fighting</b> <b>cock</b> as new insignia and the establishment of a periodical. The efficiency of the personnel was gauged in shooting competitions, with the results being sent back to the USNG for comparison with other national guards. In 1955, a Commission of the House of Representatives supervised the PRNG's exercises to gauge the entity's efficiency. During the passing of Hurricane Santa Clara, the 296th's Company I provided support to the government. The 296th's Engineering Company 225 was tasked with the construction of a bridge.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1921 FA Cup final the Tottenham Hotspur crest has {{featured}} a cockerel. Harry Hotspur, after whom {{the club is}} named, {{was said to have}} been given the nickname Hotspur as he dug in his spurs to make his horse go faster as he charged in battles, and he was also said to be fond of fighting cocks fitted with spurs. The club used spurs as a symbol in 1900 which then evolved into a <b>fighting</b> <b>cock.</b> A former player named William James Scott made a bronze cast of a cockerel standing on a football at a cost of £35, and this 9 foot 6 inches emblem figure was then placed on top of the West Stand the end of the 1909–10 season. [...] Since then the cockerel and ball emblem has {{become a part of the}} club's identity.|$|E
2500|$|Cockfighting: Cockfighting was a pastime in the Indus Valley Civilization in {{what today}} is Pakistan by 2000 BCE {{and one of}} the uses of the <b>fighting</b> <b>cock.</b> [...] The Encyclopædia Britannica (2008)—on the origins of cockfighting—holds: [...] "The game fowl is {{probably}} the nearest to the Indian red jungle fowl (Gallus gallus), from which all domestic chickens are believed to be descended...The sport was popular in ancient times in the Indian subcontinent, China, the Persian Empire, and other Eastern countries and was introduced into Greece in the time of Themistocles (c. 524–460 BCE). The sport spread throughout Asia Minor and Sicily. For a long time the Romans affected to despise this [...] "Greek diversion," [...] but they ended up adopting it so enthusiastically that the agricultural writer Columella (1st century CE) complained that its devotees often spent their whole patrimony in betting {{at the side of the}} pit." ...|$|E

2500|$|The pitch was {{overlooked}} by a bronze <b>fighting</b> <b>cock</b> (the club symbol) that {{kept an eye}} on proceedings from the roof of the touchline stands. The cockerel was adopted as an emblem for the club as Harry Hotspur, after whom the club was named, was said to be fond of cock-fighting. The original cockerel on a ball was erected [...] {{at the end of the}} 1909–1910 season and was cast by William James Scott, who had played for the club when it was an amateur club. It was originally located atop the West Stand. but was removed in 1957 for upgrading of floodlighting and reappeared on top of the East Stand in December 1958. [...] In 1989, the original cockerel was removed to be replaced by fibreglass replicas that were placed on top of both the East Stand and West Stand. The original cockerel was moved to the executive suites where it stayed for many years, then to the West Stand reception. It was moved to the club offices at Lilywhite House in 2016 as the stadium was due to be demolished for redevelopment.|$|E
2500|$|In {{its early}} days, Rutgers athletes were known informally as [...] "The Scarlet" [...] in {{reference}} to the school color, or as [...] "Queensmen" [...] {{in reference to}} the institution's first name, Queen's College. In 1925, the mascot was changed to Chanticleer, a fighting rooster from the medieval fable Reynard the Fox (Le Roman de Renart) which was used by Geoffrey Chaucer in the Canterbury Tales. At the time, the student humour magazine at Rutgers was called Chanticleer, and one of its early arts editors, Ozzie Nelson (later of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet fame) was quarterback of the Rutgers team from 1924 to 1926. The Chanticleer mascot was unveiled at a football game against Lafayette College, in which Lafayette was also introducing a new mascot, a leopard. However, the choice of Chanticleer as a mascot was often the subject of ridicule because of its association with [...] "being chicken." [...] In 1955, the mascot was changed to the Scarlet Knight after a campus-wide election, beating out other contenders such as [...] "Queensmen", the [...] "Scarlet", the [...] "Red Lions", the [...] "Redmen" [...] and the [...] "Flying Dutchmen." [...] Earlier proposed nicknames included [...] "Pioneers" [...] and [...] "Cannoneers". When Harvey Harman, then coach of the football team, was asked why he supported changing the Rutgers mascot, he was quoted as saying, [...] "You can call it the Chanticleer, you can call it a <b>fighting</b> <b>cock,</b> you can call it any damn thing you want, but everybody knows it's a chicken." [...] Harman later is said to have bought the first [...] "Scarlet Knight" [...] mascot costume for the 1955 season, which was to be his final season as football coach at Rutgers.|$|E

50|$|In Cuba the {{tradition}} is to fix detachable natural (non-artificial) spurs to both {{legs of the}} <b>fighting</b> <b>cocks.</b> Before fixing the detachable spurs, the natural spurs should be trimmed, leaving a trunk not longer than 3 millimeters.

It came to us yesterday, as we sat together in this study. Dr. Huxtable had sent a telegram. James was so overwhelmed with grief and agitation that my suspicions, which had never been entirely absent, rose instantly to a certainty, and I taxed him with the deed. He made a complete voluntary confession. Then he implored me to keep his secret for three days longer, so as to give his wretched accomplice a chance of saving his guilty life. I yielded--as I have always yielded--to his prayers, and instantly James hurried off to the <b>Fighting</b> <b>Cock</b> to warn Hayes and give him the means of flight. I could not go there by daylight without provoking comment, {{but as soon as}} night fell I hurried off to see my dear Arthur. I found him safe and well, but horrified beyond expression by the dreadful deed he had witnessed. In deference to my promise, and much against my will, I consented to leave him there for three days, under the charge of Mrs. Hayes, since it was evident {{that it was impossible to}} inform the police where he was without telling them also who was the murderer, and I could not see how that murderer could be punished without ruin to my unfortunate James.

When James determined to kidnap Lord Saltire, it was of this man's service that he availed himself. You remember that I wrote to Arthur upon that last day. Well, James opened the letter and inserted a note asking Arthur to meet him in a little wood called the Ragged Shaw, which is near to the school. He used the Duchess's name, and in that way got the boy to come. That evening James bicycled over--I am telling you what he has himself confessed to me--and he told Arthur, whom he met in the wood, that his mother longed to see him, that she was awaiting him on the moor, and that if he would come back into the wood at midnight he would find a man with a horse, who would take him to her. Poor Arthur fell into the trap. He came to the appointment, and found this fellow Hayes with a led pony. Arthur mounted, and they set off together. It appears--though this James only heard yesterday--that they were pursued, that Hayes struck the pursuer with his stick, and that the man died of his injuries. Hayes brought Arthur to his public-house, the <b>Fighting</b> <b>Cock,</b> where he was confined in an upper room, under the care of Mrs. Hayes, who is a kindly woman, but entirely under the control of her brutal husband.|$|E
