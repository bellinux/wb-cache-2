500|$|By 1981, Paul Di'Anno was demonstrating {{increasingly}} self-destructive behaviour, particularly {{through his}} drug usage, about which Di'Anno comments, [...] "it wasn't just that I was snorting {{a bit of}} coke, though; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> for it non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day... the band had commitments piling up that went on for months, years, and I just couldn't see {{my way to the}} end of it. I knew I'd never last the whole tour. It was too much." [...] With his performances suffering, Di'Anno was immediately dismissed following the Killer World Tour, at which point the band had already selected his replacement.|$|E
500|$|According to her suicide note, Alcorn {{had felt}} [...] "like a girl {{trapped in a}} boy's body" [...] since she was four, and came to {{identify}} as a transgender girl {{from the age of}} fourteen, when she became aware of the term. According to her note, she immediately informed her mother, who reacted [...] "extremely negatively" [...] by claiming that it was only a phase and that God had made her a male, so she could never be a woman. She stated that this made her hate herself, and that she developed a form of depression. Her mother sent her to Christian conversion therapists, but Alcorn later related that here she only encountered [...] "more Christians" [...] telling her that she was [...] "selfish and wrong" [...] and [...] "should look to God for help." [...] Aged sixteen, she requested that she be allowed to undergo transition treatment, but was denied permission: in her words, [...] "I felt hopeless, that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> to look like a man in drag {{for the rest of my}} life. On my 16th birthday, when I didn't receive consent from my parents to start transitioning, I cried myself to sleep." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} {{interview}} with SheWired.com, Michael K {{was asked to}} name {{the reason for the}} blog's success. He said, [...] "I don't know. I never promoted it. I never advertised. That was never my goal. I think it was that my friends would read it and they'd send it to their friends. I used to post personal pictures and stuff because I saw it as both a personal blog and a blog about just things that I like. So that's when I decided I wasn't going to make it personal. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> to cover this and focus on that." ...|$|E

2500|$|..... One {{morning as}} I was making my thanksgiving after Communion, {{a very strong}} {{distraction}} took hold of me. I thought I saw a great plain full of people enveloped in thick fog. They were walking about like people who had lost their way {{and did not know}} which way to turn. Someone near me said: 'This is England'. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> to ask some questions, when I saw Pope Pius IX just like I have seen him in pictures. He was robed magnificently and carried in his hand a torch alive with flames. As he walked slowly towards that immense gathering of people, the leaping flames from the torch dispelled the fog, and the people stood in the splendour of the noonday sun. 'That torch', said the one beside me, 'is the Catholic Faith, which is going to light up England'".|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Brooks {{returned}} to EastEnders for a guest stint. She was later confirmed {{to be coming}} back as a regular character. She said, [...] "I had doubts to begin with, mainly because of Kiki, as I know how full-on EastEnders can be, and then there's that stigma {{about going back to}} a soap. But I'm so pleased I did, it was the right decision. Especially with what's going on at the moment, I feel really lucky to have a job and I need the security because of Kiki. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> to go back for a year, but I had a meeting with the boss last week and we're going to go for another year. So lots more time to get up to much mischief". Executive producer Diederick Santer said, [...] "I couldn't be more pleased that Charlie Brooks is re-joining EastEnders. With her appearances last month, she reminded us what a fine actress she is, and what an intriguing, watchable and engaging character she plays as Janine". She temporarily departed in September 2012, and returned in April 2013 before departing again in March 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Vergne's {{right hand}} {{was injured in}} the {{collision}} with Piquet and required an X-ray scan after complaining {{he was unable to}} move it correctly. He was annoyed with Piquet and briefly visited the NextEV garage to know if the latter had also retired. Vergne stated that he would ensure that he was fit for the next race of the season in Paris but felt the incident [...] "destroyed" [...] his race in Monaco. He believed that the crash prevented him from finishing on the podium and chose not to speak to Piquet after the event ended. Piquet was annoyed at Vergne's attempts at overtaking him, labelling him [...] "impatient" [...] and felt he could have been easily passed during the pit stop phase. He thought Vergne would slow down because the latter was unwilling to be overtaken around the outside, and that Vergne had placed himself in that situation, deeming it [...] "unnecessary" [...] but felt it was a [...] "racing incident": [...] "It's a shame, I hate that it happened with him and I hate these kinds of situations. I don't like bad feelings and I'm sure he's very upset and thinks I did it on purpose, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> to defend my position." [...] Vergne represented the incident as less important six days later by saying he did not regret performing his manoeuvre and it was part of motor racing.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{think that}} is a capital plan," [...] Mark said, [...] "and if I don't go to the bank there will be nothing to lead them to suppose that I have taken them out, or that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> across to Holland." ...|$|R
