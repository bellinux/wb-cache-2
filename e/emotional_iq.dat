The literature review explores how people with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) experience their relationships with others. The results showed that compared with the general population, children and adolescents perceive their friendship quality to be lower and adults with ASD perceive their marital and parent-child relationships to be the same. A number of strategies are used by people with ASD to facilitate the development of relationships and other people also use strategies for this reason. Furthermore, people with ASD report a number of personal qualities that serve to either facilitate or inhibit the development of relationships. The empirical paper explores how much people with Asperger's syndrome understand about positive attachment behaviours between parents and young babies and whether this knowledge can be increased {{through the use of}} a DVD.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if the emotional intelligence of gifted adolescents contributes significantly to their social and academic success, and specifically if emotional intelligence was of importance above and beyond traditional psychometric intelligence (IQ). This study tested the claims of Goleman (1995) who argued that emotional intelligence was critical to our understanding of human success, and often times more important than IQ. A group of 39 adolescents (mean age = 16 years 6 months) who were enrolled in a residential high school for gifted youths participated. The Adolescent Multifactor Emotional Intelligence Scale (AMEIS) (Mayer, Salovey, and Caruso, 1996) and the Test of Cognitive Skills (2 nd ed.) (CTB MacMillan/McGraw-Hill, 1993) were utilized to attain overall levels of <b>emotional</b> intelligence and <b>IQ,</b> respectively. The Behavior Assessment System for Children - Self-Report - Adolescent Version (BASC-SRP-A) (Reynolds & Kamphaus, 1992) was used to measure two types of social success: interpersonal relations and social stress. Academic success was determined by student grade point averages. The results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that emotional intelligence did not contribute significantly to the social and academic success for these gifted adolescents. These results suggest that Goleman's argument about the significance of emotional intelligence may be overstated, at least when studying this sample of gifted adolescents. However, future research will need to address the need for improved measurement of emotional intelligence, possibly studying specific components of emotional intelligence. Larger samples that include gifted students from more common settings may also help clarify the importance of emotional intelligence in this population.

From a pilot study, {{it is known that}} the implementation of Values Education within MKDU still put the emphasis to merely transfer of knowledge that requires only factual judgment. This research has a purpose to study some problems in the application of values education within MKDU, and also to generate theories through findings derived from data analysis and generalizations. Owing to the vast scope of phenomenon under study, this research is limited merely to the subjects which are included to Personality Development Subjects (MPK), and from an in depth considerations the focus of the research is generated as follows: 1) the messages of values carried out within MKDU, 2) lecturer’s perspectives on values education, 3) the implementation of values education, 4) factors influencing the implementation of values education. Values education concerns with moral and non-moral considerations of any objects; including ethics and aesthetics. The objectives of values education is to help students to explore the existence values through critical judgment so that {{he will be able to}} improve the quality of his reasoning and also his emotion. Values education at least encompasses four dimensions, those are: 1) the identification the personal and social core values; the philosophy and rational findings of those core values; emotional and afectual respond upon those core values; the decision making concerning those values based on such findings and responds. Values education such as “values conflict” equips students with an opportunity to verify and clarify their own values and exploring alternative solutions to improve students’ capacity in making a responsible and fair decision. This study uses single analytical model throughout the whole study—a qualitative case study—and this model was applied as an in depth examination of some specific problems concerning the implementation of values education within MKDU. This study uses three main techniques in collecting data: interview, participant observation, and document analysis. To analyze the data two strategies were applied: general and operational strategies. The general strategy was done by synchronizing the data with the correlative assumptions underpinning values education. Whereas operational strategy was done by applying two techniques of analysis simultaneously (“Modified Analytic Induction” & “Constant Comparative Method”). Both strategies were done with a purpose to keep the consistency of the study and also to come to the most valid and reliable data. The most important findings of this study are that Values Education puts too much emphasis on student’s cognitive achievement rather than the balance between their intellectual (<b>IQ),</b> <b>emotional</b> (EQ), and spiritual quotient (SQ) at once. The process of valuing (emoting and spiritualizing) is not occurred within values education...|$|R

Cross-cultural research highlights a deficit of up-to-date comparative data on Russian organizational leadership, whilst practitioners articulate the demand for Russia-appropriate leadership development expertise. Increasingly, scholars advocate the application of integrated theories for assessing organizational leadership; contributing to several scholars updating trait theory into competency terms (including emotional competencies). Recent studies in the UK have established linkages amongst the competencies required for effective leadership, executives’ emotional competencies, and the demonstrated leadership styles of managers. This research extends these UK findings, investigating the possible relationship between the leadership competencies, Emotional Intelligence (EI), and leadership styles of Russian managers working within domestic and foreign MNCs. The researcher employed the Leadership Dimensions Questionnaire (LDQ) as the standardized measurement instrument for conducting this “etic” (comparative) study. The LDQ assesses managers based on 15 dimensions, representing cognitive (<b>IQ),</b> <b>Emotional</b> Intelligence (EQ), and managerial competencies (MQ); generating a leadership style “profile” based on the respondent’s scores.

40|$|Philosophiae Doctor - PhDCurrent {{leadership}} {{models have}} been unable to develop leaders who are capable of successfully addressing organisational challenges such as the unethical conduct, poor performance and low morale in the South African public service. Literature suggesting that spiritual leadership may improve organisational performance is emerging. The {{purpose of this study is}} to propose and present an Integrated Spiritual Leadership (ISL) model that is relevant to the South African public service and which can address burgeoning organisational challenges. In order to realise this research purpose, the study examined theoretical perspectives pertaining to spirituality, spiritual leadership and workplace spirituality. After leadership theories within the traditional and spiritual paradigms had been discussed and compared, spiritual leadership emerged as a comprehensive leadership theory. The literature on spiritual leadership also examines empirical evidence showing the way in which spiritual leadership may enhance organisational performance. The analysis of spiritual leadership models exposed a gap in the literature and highlighted the dearth of spiritual leadership research in the African and, especially, in the South African context. The development of the ISL model was based on a comparative analysis of the nine published leadership models of the following researchers and which are premised on spiritual leadership principles – Danah Zohar and Ian Marshall, Kevin Cashman, Stephen Covey, Gilbert Fairholm, The Memorial Hermann, Louis Fry, Jeffry Ferguson and John Milliman, Margaret Benefiel, and Sangeeta Parameshwar. The ISL model comprises three core levels, namely, the spiritual leadership, team and organisational levels. These levels are all interconnected and aligned. The spiritual leadership level is characterised by four key attributes, namely, higher purpose and vision, core positive values, application of personal intelligences and changing from the inside out. In terms of the public service the three levels of the ISL model may influence individual, team and organisational outcomes by promoting the effective and efficient expenditure of public funds, improved service delivery and increased employee well-being. However, in view of the fact that the model was based on Western international models it was necessary to establish the relevance of the ISL model within the South African public service context. This study was situated in the national and provincial government departments in the South African public service. A qualitative, phenomenological study was conducted to ascertain the deep, richly textured perceptions regarding the relevance of the ISL model as regards the public service. In-depth interviews with 22 respondents, including public service managers, service providers and students of spiritual leadership training, were conducted in order to garner their opinions about the ISL model. In addition, a quantitative survey was conducted to determine the extent to which the respondents perceived the ISL model’s constructs to be relevant for public service managers. The survey was completed by 233 public service managers from public service departments in both provincial and national government departments. Both the survey and the interview respondents perceive the ISL model to be relevant for public service managers. However, the findings are relevant for Gauteng public service departments only as the data collected were not sufficiently representative of all the provinces in South Africa. Many of the respondents were of the opinion that managers who embrace and model spiritual leadership principles such as higher purpose and core positive values are well equipped to overcome organisational challenges. However, although there was general agreement as regards the constructs of the ISL model, there was no conclusive agreement on the ranking of the personal intelligences. 1 A lack of technical competence influenced the survey participants to prioritise IQ above the other intelligences, whilst the interview 1 For the purposes of this study, mental intelligence (<b>IQ),</b> <b>emotional</b> intelligence (EQ), spiritual intelligence (SQ) and physical intelligence (PQ) are deemed to be personal intelligences. respondents rated spiritual intelligence (SQ) as the highest form of intelligence. The study recommends that a comprehensive approach is required if the ISL model is to be implemented successfully and in a sustainable way. It emerged that if senior managers were to endorse and promote the ISL model, this may result in the model being implemented more successfully. A specialised unit should continuously promote and monitor the realisation of the relevant department’s purpose and values. Relevant stakeholders should be involved to ensure widespread acceptance and endorsement, while the organisational strategy, systems, structure and culture should be aligned to the purpose, values and principles of the ISL model in order to promote organisational performance and employee well-being. In addition, service providers who develop the ISL model into a training and development intervention should foster deep learning so that public service leaders and managers fully embrace and internalise the principles of the ISL model. Finally, this study recommended future research. A follow-up study should be conducted to determine the relevance of this ISL model as regards all the provinces in the country as well as local government. In addition, a longitudinal study is recommended to determine the impact of the implementation of the ISL model on the South African public service...|$|R
