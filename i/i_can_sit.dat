2500|$|While Italy {{declared}} war on France and Britain on 10 June, it was not prepared for war and made little impact {{during the last two}} weeks of fighting in the Italian invasion of France. Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was aware of this and sought to profit from German successes. Mussolini felt the conflict would soon end and he reportedly said to the Army's Chief-of-Staff, Marshal Badoglio, [...] "I only need a few thousand dead so that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> at the peace conference as a man who has fought." [...] The Army of the Alps (General René Olry) defeated the Italian invasion.|$|E
2500|$|Singer Christina Aguilera {{was upset}} about the lyric, [...] "Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst / and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first" [...] from [...] "The Real Slim Shady", calling the rapper's claim [...] "disgusting, {{offensive}} and, above all, not true". Eminem included this line after becoming angry with the singer for informing the public during an MTV special without his consent about the rapper's secret marriage to Kim Mathers. However, the two later settled their differences after hugging backstage at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, with the singer appearing at the premiere of 8 Mile months later.|$|E
2500|$|The 2nd Test match {{witnessed}} many controversial umpiring decisions {{from the}} two umpires - Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson and even the third Umpire. Three of Steve Bucknor's gaffes occurred {{when he did not}} give Andrew Symonds out caught behind at 30 when TV Replays clearly showed that the ball had passed through the bat's edge. The second one occurred when Bucknor did not refer a stumping call against Andrew Symonds to the third umpire. Replays showed the Australia all-rounder’s foot wasn't grounded inside the crease when the bails came off. This was a major boost for Australia as Symonds went on to make 162 not out and brought Australia back into the Game. After these incidents, Andrew Symonds said, [...] "I was very lucky. I was out when I was 30, given not out. That's cricket though, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> here and tell you about my bad decisions as well - but I won't." [...] On the fifth day, Bucknor declared Rahul Dravid out caught behind though television replays later showed the ball had brushed his pad without touching his bat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure," [...] was the answer; [...] "though {{my first}} feedin' was buffalo-milk {{as near as}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> remember. <b>Sit</b> down an' have some grub. The bosses ain't turned out yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Into {{the eggs}} with asparagus-tips? Donnez m'en s'il vous plaît. My dear fellow, how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> stand? how <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>sit?</b> Where's {{the money to}} come from?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, bad, Macumazahn; {{even now}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> {{scarcely}} <b>sit</b> down, for that bull {{had a very}} hard nose; also I am swollen up in front where Sikauli struck me when he tumbled out of the tree. Also my heart is cut in two because of our losses." ...|$|R
60|$|MR. BARLOW. Not late yet. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> {{with you}} another half-hour. I am feeling better to-day. Winifred, sing {{something}} for us.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What a {{singular}} destiny ours has been, Venetia! 'said Cadurcis. 'Do you know, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> {{for an hour}} together and muse over it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' said Halvor, 'I {{will not}} go up there till early to-morrow morning; let me stay here to-night. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> down on the hearth.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing. He {{just came}} along. <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> down?" [...] Kramer found a stiff upright chair beside the bed. [...] "If I'm bothering you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{think of}} it!" [...] softly sobbed Mrs. Cliff, {{after she had}} {{carefully}} closed her bedroom door. [...] "With this and what I am to get, I believe I could buy the bank, and yet <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>sit</b> here and {{try to think of}} some place to hide this dangerous piece of paper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, that is Greenly, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> swear!--He'll not <b>sit</b> {{down until}} we are all aweigh, and {{standing}} out. Does the cutter tell us which way the count was looking?" ...|$|R
60|$|This {{is at the}} Court a blank day, {{being that}} of the poor Duke of York's funeral. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> at home, luckily, and fag hard.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know: {{in one way}} he may be, but not in another. I {{really do}} not think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> down to table with Doctor Thorne." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to hear it," [...] he said. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> here and have a little {{conversation}} with you, Fan--your name is Fan, is it not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won’t," [...] said Fletcher. [...] "You {{can choose}} the alternative: disgrace and penal servitude. Don’t stand over me; you won’t frighten me, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> assure you. <b>Sit</b> down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't often. Been rehearsing with Joe {{up at the}} Century Roof, and had {{a quarter}} of an hour to get a bite. <b>Can</b> <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> down?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{have always}} been old-fashioned enough to believe it is much better to git up and get {{than it is to}} sit down and set. The only animal <b>I</b> know which <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> and still produce {{dividends}} is the old hen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But we must {{do without}} it, my dear," [...] said I, [...] "at least for a while. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> out on deck and smoke of an evening, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Euphemia. [...] "You {{can sit on}} the bulwarks and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> by you. That will do very well. I'm sure I'm {{glad the}} boat has bulwarks." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her eyes filled. She {{drew her}} hand from Mrs. Bretton's and made a {{movement}} to leave her lap; it was at first resisted, but she said--"Please, I wish to go: <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> on a stool." ...|$|E

In 2009, the double disc You Know Where The East Side Is was published, selling for $85 each, which makes it the most {{expensive}} album record.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>sit</b> still, my {{last evening}} in England, without lifting a finger, while you immolate {{a woman to}} whom I feel like a brother. I'll tell you what your {{principle}} is: Authority, unjust or just, desirable or undesirable, must be implicitly obeyed. To break a law, no matter on what provocation, or for whose sake, is to break the commandment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{the best}} company {{on earth to}} talk secrets in," [...] said John. [...] "I have {{reasonable}} good lungs, but he tries 'em <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tell you. <b>Sit</b> down, sir. All friends here, and glad to see you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{much the}} better that the {{hesitation}} should come from me. But {{if you think it}} better, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> down here and write to him at once declining the offer." [...] She moved towards the desk.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wounded sorely," [...] the English knight said. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> my horse, and methinks that it {{were best}} to ride off at once, seeing the Flemings are flying. We can assuredly do no good by remaining." ...|$|E
6000|$|My own darling Lucy, {{it will be}} ever so much better. I [...] {{know that}} you are not happy in Kingsbury Crescent, and [...] that I shall bear it very much better. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> still and [...] mend sheets.|$|E
6000|$|... ["The shadowy desert, unfrequented woods, [...] I better brook than flourishing peopled towns: [...] There <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> alone, unseen of any, [...] And to the nightingale's {{complaining}} notes [...] Tune my distresses, and record, my woes." ...|$|R
60|$|Then why don't {{you treat}} me as your wife? You {{seem to think}} I'm only fit to see after the house and order the dinner and mend your clothes. And after that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> go and <b>sit</b> {{in the kitchen with}} the servant.|$|R
6000|$|... "They're {{glad to see}} us. We mean {{something}} here. These people are satisfied. Why can't <b>I</b> be? But <b>can</b> <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> back all my life and be satisfied with 'Hey, folks'? They want shouts on Main Street, and I want violins in a paneled room. Why----?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{write these}} few lines {{on a fast}} train that is {{carrying}} me back to New York, a cool, comfortable train, with a deserted club-car where <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> in a leather arm-chair, with my feet up on another, smoking, silent, and at peace.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> {{down for}} a few minutes," [...] {{she said in her}} pretty foreign accent, [...] "I shall soon be myself again, and I shall not {{trespass}} any further on your kindness. I thank you very much, sir, for taking care of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What does {{it matter}} if it has? What are my feelings? A bunch o' fal-de-rol flowers as a {{gardener}} clips off wi' never a thought is preferred before mine as I've fettled after this three-week. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> at home to keep my flowers company—nobody wants 'em." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Horton," [...] spoke Mary, and he at once {{turned back}} from the door and faced her. [...] "You have come here to see Miss Eden, and I {{do not wish to}} drive you away before you have spoken to her. <b>I</b> suppose we <b>can</b> <b>sit</b> in the same room for a few minutes longer." ...|$|R
5000|$|Of her lyrics, she says, [...] "I write lyrics about junkyard prostitutes, {{life in the}} fearsome {{crowd and}} the fact that your lover is 72.8% water. I was told once that I'm pretty good on guitar 'for a girl'. I wasn't sure if that was a compliment. I am an active campaigner against teenage angst and histrionics in music. I quite like train {{journeys}} because they're one of the rare occasions when <b>I</b> <b>can</b> just <b>sit</b> and think." ...|$|R
60|$|All {{yesterday}} and to-day {{the sea was}} quite calm, and we could sit on deck. I was glad because, in the cabin where I am, there are three other women, and it is below the water-line, and is very close and horrid. So when it is rough, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>sit</b> in the alley-way with my knitting. There the light is very dim and the air bad. But I do not complain. It is woman's lot. Uncle William and Cousin Willie have both told me this--that it is woman's lot to bear and to suffer; and they said it with such complete resignation that I feel I ought to imitate their attitude.|$|R
