500|$|In {{his book}} The Message <b>Given</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>by</b> Extraterrestrials (now republished as Intelligent Design: Message from the Designers 2006 [...] ), Claude Vorilhon claims that on 13 December 1973, {{he found a}} {{spacecraft}} shaped like a flattened bell that landed inside Puy de Lassolas, a volcano near {{the capital city of}} Auvergne. A 25,000-year-old human-like extraterrestrial inside the spacecraft named Yahweh said that Elohim was the name that primitive people of Earth called members of his extraterrestrial race—who were seen as [...] "those who came from the sky". Yahweh explained that Earth was originally void of life, with thick clouds and shallow seas, but the Elohim came, broke apart the clouds, exposed the seas to sunlight, built a continent, and synthesized a global ecosystem. Solar astronomy, terraformation, nanotechnology, and genetic engineering allowed Elohim to adapt life to Earth's thermal and chemical makeup.|$|E
500|$|Bevin said he [...] "strongly disagreed" [...] {{with the}} Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Obergefell v. Hodges legalizing same-sex marriage, continuing [...] "When {{the definition of}} marriage {{was put on the}} ballot 10 years ago, 74 percent of Kentuckians {{made it clear that they}} supported traditional marriage. Since that time, however, activist judges have chosen to ignore the will of the people, and to ignore the Constitutional principle of state's rights." [...] He then attacked Conway, who refused to appeal the 2014 federal court opinion that Kentucky's defense of marriage amendment violated the federal constitution: [...] "Jack Conway's failure to do his job and defend our laws in Kentucky disqualifies him from being elected to the office of Governor." [...] Conway responded that he [...] "used the discretion <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>by</b> statute to inform Gov. Beshear and the citizens of the Commonwealth that I would not waste the scarce resources of this office pursuing a costly appeal that would not be successful." [...] Bevin contended that Conway's decision cost Kentucky taxpayers $2.3 million, citing the cost of private attorneys that Beshear hired to defend the amendment in Conway's place.|$|E

2500|$|In 1950, disciples Mahendra Patel and Purushottam Patel held small {{personal}} services {{at their homes}} in England. Mahendra Patel, a barrister by vocation, writes, [...] "I landed in London in 1950 for further studies. Purushottambhai Patel...was residing in the county of Kent. His address was <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>by</b> Yogiji Maharaj". Beginning 1953, D. D.

2500|$|Kanaris {{brought with}} him the Cypriots who created the [...] "Column of Cypriots" [...] («Φάλαγγα των Κυπρίων»), led by General Chatzipetros, which fought with {{extraordinary}} heroism in Greece. In total, over 1000 Cypriots fought in the War of Independence, many of whom died. At Missolonghi many were killed, and at the Battle of Athens in 1827, around 130 were killed. General Chatzipetros, showing military decorations declared [...] "These were <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>by</b> the heroism and braveness of the Column of Cypriots". In the National Library, there {{is a list of}} 580 names of Cypriots who fought in the War between 1821 and 1829.|$|E

2500|$|There are, {{as in all}} Helm books, {{at least}} two beautiful, and {{somewhat}} mysterious, women, whose patriotic affiliations are questionable right {{to the end of}} the story, and who cause both complications and murderous attacks on Helm. [...] He survives the attacks, however, in the course of which he kills, mostly by guns, but occasionally by knife, at least six or seven enemy operatives of various loyalties. [...] On page 89, in a motel cabin surrounded by dead bodies, he is obliged to set the scene for the forthcoming policemen by leaving behind the small four-inch-bladed knife that has been featured in most of the books since the very first — [...] "it had been <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>by</b> a woman, now dead, who'd once meant a good deal to me — but this was no time for sentimentality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oliver was criticised for underestimating {{the cost}} of {{supposedly}} cheap food he encouraged poor people to prepare for themselves, also for an unrealistic view of poverty in Britain and round the Mediterranean. Cookery writer and poverty campaigner Jack Monroe stated that Oliver's comments [...] "support damaging myths that poor people are only poor because they spend their money on the wrong things, rather than being constrained by time, equipment, knowledge or practicalities". Monroe added, [...] "When I was living on £10 a week for food, because of mistakes with housing benefit payments, I didn't need a hug. I needed a fiver, {{just to have a}} little bit more to eat. I didn't need [...] to Sicily to see how the street cleaners ate, I needed someone {{to point out that the}} 21p can of kidney beans could be the staple ingredient in a nutritious meal. I needed practical advice about what to do with the tins of food <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>by</b> the food bank." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} {{reported}} that top Pakistani Foreign Office officials alleged Pakistan's President, Asif Ali Zardari instructed the Foreign Office in categorical terms that Davis be given diplomatic immunity and for this purpose the Foreign Office should immediately issue a backdated letter notifying Davis as 'member of staff member of the US embassy, in Islamabad.' Former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi refused, saying: [...] "on {{the basis of the}} official record and the advice <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>by</b> the technocrats and experts of the Foreign Office, I could not certify him (Raymond Davis) as a diplomat. The kind of by blanket immunity Washington is pressing for Davis, is not endorsed by the official record of the Foreign Ministry." [...] Qureshi reiterated this stance after a meeting with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry on February 16. Qureshi said he kept quiet on the Davis case earlier upon instructions from the leadership of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), but implied that his stance on the matter had cost him his job. As of February 16 a new foreign minister has not yet been appointed.|$|E
