In the field of Electrocardiography 24 <b>hour</b> ECG <b>recorders</b> for medical applications and wireless pulse per minute measurement belts with watch displays for consumer applications are on the market. The discussed solution addresses high precision time measurement between ECG pulses. An integrated circuit was developed which measures the pulse duration with 12 bit resolution. The device includes preamplification, fully integrated bandpass filter, peak detector, time measurement unit and FSK modulator for wireless transmitter.

40|$|A {{qualitative}} research study {{was carried out}} to explore problems of organizational conflict. The conditions and processes of organizational conflict, issues of substantive organizational conflict, and organizational learning or failure to learn were investigated. A variation of intensive interviewing, semi-structured, was used to obtain primary information on organizational events at the Boston Ballet, a nonprofit performing arts organization {{made up of a}} ballet school and a ballet company. Six organizational members occupying different positions from the art, teaching, and administrative staffs were interviewed. Five of the six had been interviewed ten months earlier in 1984. There were four telephone interviews, two were follow-up and two were conducted with former organization members. On average, interviews lasted two <b>hours.</b> A tape <b>recorder</b> was used during face-to-face interviews. Thirty-one questions were formulated to focus on substantive issues of organizational conflict. Letters of inquiry were also used to obtain information. Conflict-in-development, in-change, and-in-growth were discovered at the Boston Ballet. Features of conflict-in-development include the persistence of conflict around issues of organizational roles, values, and methods; the stages of conflict where issues and interactions of conflict occur only at certain times; the contradictions of conflict where an organization grows and develops despite conflict; and the learning from experience in some cases but not in others.

40|$|Typical {{recorders}} {{commonly used}} now in Japan to record low speed phenomena have chart speeds of several centimeters per hour. These chart speeds are convenient to see daily variations such as earth tides, {{but are not}} adequate {{for the purpose of}} glancing the variations of longer periods. In order to see directly the secular variations of very slowly progressing phenomena such as crustal movements, a recording system which has ultra-low chart speed (several cm/month) and ultra-low frequency characteristics was developed. The method adopted here is to plot the sum of the data which was sampled in the past 24 <b>hours,</b> while the <b>recorder</b> is driven intermittently. The features of this system are as follows: (1) Owing to its ultra-low chart speed, we can directly see the progress of the phenomena within a few days or a few months. This may offer useful information for the short period earthquake prediction. (2) Owing to its ultra-low frequency characteristics, we can pick up the signals which are buried in daily disturbances of large amplitudes. (3) Owing to the durability of the recording chart, we can be free from frequent maintenance of the system. (4) As the system is constructed by use of a microprocessor, we will be easily able to correspond to future demands such as improvement of the data-smoothing algorithm...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} add long period {{seismograph}}s to our radio tele-recording seismograph system we {{are developing a}} long period seismograph system as shown in Table 1. In this paper, {{we report on the}} long period seismograph designated as No. 2 in Table 1. The maximum magnification of the seismograph is approximately 1000 at the period of 30 sec. The response curve covers the period range 10 to 100 sec. The design of the pendulum is shown in Fig. 1. The brass boom is 45 cm long and the mass is 5000. gr. The axis of rotation is obtained by a knife edge at the point (5) and a steel ribbon at the point (13) as shown in Fig. 1. The pendulum period is adjustable for a range of 10 to 65 sec with good stabilty. The transducer of the seismograph is a moving coil which has a winding of 100, 000 turns with a mean diameter of 4. 2 cm and a resistance of 1 Megaohms. The magnet is made of MK- 5 with pole pieces arranged to produce a radial magnetic field of 3500. gauss. A shunt capacitance is used to lengthen the period of pendulum. The theory for the period lengthener was given by Coulomb (1952). The output of transducer is then put into an integrator with the time constant of 63 sec (2 πRC). The function of this network is that of a double integrator having identical time constant. (See Fig. 2 and 3) The D. C. amplifier which is used to amplify the output of the integrator is the chopper type. Its amplification is 20 Volts per 100 micro-volts at the load resistance of 4 Kilo-ohms and the drift is less than ± 20 micro-volts in 24 <b>hours.</b> The <b>recorder</b> is an ink-writing galvanometer with period of 0. 03 sec and sensitivity of 5 mm per 1 m amp. The seismograph was constructed in February 1962, and has been operated at Yasuda Hall in the campus of Tokyo University. A typical record is shown in Fig. 8, where the upper traces 1 and 2 are the record of Press-Ewing seismograph (To = 30 sec. Tg = 90 sec 3) and the lower trace is that of our seismograph...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the perceptions of faculty in the communication field on the communication education, competencies, the relationship between related areas and the future of communication education in order for evaluating the concept of communication education. In order to gather data from faculty, interviewing technique was used. Hence, the researchers firstly decided on the faculty names for interviews. Then, date of meeting was appointed by telephone. In determining the views, the faculty who has enough experience and different background were interviewed using semi-structured interview technique. Totally eight faculty members were interviewed that is appropriate to purposeful sampling method. Sample 8 faculty were from different communication faculties throughout Turkey which were Anadolu University (2), Ankara University (2), Gazi University (1), Bilkent University (1), Beykent University (1), and Bahçeşehir University (1). Average of the interviews’ duration was one <b>hour.</b> Digital voice <b>recorder</b> was used during the interviews. The researchers also took notes during the interview. To analyze the interviews the following procedures were conducted respectively: Voice records were transcripted word by word. Analysis themes were specified using interview questions and research purposes. Then interview coding form was prepared. Analysis of the faculty perceptions were completed according to the interview coding form. The data were organized and presented under the research themes. The findings of this study are presented under topics such as communication education, communication field competencies, departments of communication faculties, existing issues and future discussions, curriculum, lessons and instructional activities...|$|R
40|$|All {{patients}} {{suitable for}} beta blockade entering the coronary care units at Oxford and Manchester were studied in a randomised trial {{to determine whether}} administration of intravenous atenolol within 12 hours of chest pain reduced infarct size and ventricular arrythmias. Infarct size was measured using cumulative CKMB release and R wave changes from the standard ECG. The preliminary report on the first 214 patients showed prevention of infarction and a mean one third reduction in infarct size in patients with initial definite infarction (Yusuf et al, 1980). Reanalysis of the data when 400 patients were randomised confirmed the observations of the initial analysis. In patients with initial threatened infarction (n = 143), 59 % of control patients developed infarction compared to 37 % in the atenolol treated patients (2 p < 0. 01). In 247 subjects with initial definite infarction, {{the percentage of the}} original R wave remaining was 34. 5 ± 8 in the atenolol treated subjects (2 p < 0. 0001). In 247 subjects with initial definite infarction, the percentage of the original R wave remaining was 34. 5 ± 2. 1 in the controls compared to 43. 4 ± 2. 1 in the atenolol treated patients (2 p < 0. 003). Although bradycardia and hypotension were commoner in atenolol treated subjects (44 and 23 respectively) compared to controls (18 and 8 respectively), this was easily reversible by stopping the drug or using atropine. Inotropic drugs were only needed in 4 atenolol and 2 control subjects. More control patients needed treatment for heart failure compared to the atenolol group in hospital and at discharge (2 p < 0. 10 and 2 p < 0. 05). Ventricular arrythmias were recorded using a 24 <b>hour</b> Medilog <b>recorder</b> in 47 atenolol and 47 control subjects. There was a significant reduction in the incidence of R on T (prematurity index < 1. 0) ventricular ectopics (41 % AT v 90 % controls 2 p < 0. 001), a significant slowing of the rate of sustained ventricular tachycardia (mean 144 in AT v 165 beats/min control 2 p < 0. 02), a significant delay in the prematurity index of VT (1. 70 in AT v 1. 34 in controls (2 p < 0. 01) and coupling interval of VT (680 msec in AT v 503 msec in controls 2 p < 0. 01). In conclusion, early IV Atenolol decreases infarct size and reduces the incidence and severity of ventricular arrythmias in patients with acute myocardial infarctions. A larger study is required to assess if these physiological benefits lead to a reduction in early and long term mortality...|$|R
40|$|His views {{have had}} as much, if not more, impact onthe {{way we think}} about {{monetary}} policy and many otherimportant economic issues as those of any person in the lasthalf of the twentieth century. These words in praise ofMilton Friedman are from economist and Federal Reserve ChairAlan Greenspan. They are spoken from a vantage point ofexperience and knowledge of what really matters for policydecisions in the real world. And they are no exaggeration. Many would say they do not go far enough. It is arare monetary policy conference today in which MiltonFriedman s ideas do not come up. It is a rare paper inmacroeconomics in which some economic, mathematical, orstatistical idea cannot be traced to Milton Friedman s earlywork. It is a rare student of macroeconomics who has notbeen impressed by reading Milton Friedman s crystal-clearexpositions. It is a rare democrat from a formerly communistcountry who was not inspired by Milton Friedman s defense ofa market economy written in the heydays of central planning. And it is a rare day that some popular newspaper or magazinearound the world does not mention Milton Friedman as theoriginator of a seminal idea or point of view. Anyone of his many contributions to macroeconomics (or ratherto monetary theory, for he detests the term macroeconomics) would be an extraordinary achievement. Taken together theyare daunting: permanent income theory; natural rate theory; the case forfloating exchange rates; money growth rules; the optimal quantity of money; the monetary history of the United States,especially the Fed in the Great Depression, not to mentioncontributions to mathematical statistics on rank-ordertests, sequential sampling, and risk aversion, and a host ofnovel government reform proposals from the negative incometax, to school vouchers, to the flat-rate tax, to thelegalization of drugs. Milton Friedman is aneconomist s economist who laid out a specific methodology ofpositive economic research. Economic experts know that manycurrent ideas and policies from monetary policy rulesto the earned-income tax credit can be traced to hisoriginal proposals. He won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1976 for his achievements in the field of consumptionanalysis, monetary history and theory and for hisdemonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy. Preferring to stay away from formal policy-making jobs, hehas been asked for his advice by presidents, primeministers, and top economic officials for many years. It isin the nature of Milton Friedman s unequivocally statedviews that many disagree with at least some of them, and hehas engaged in heated debates since graduate school days atthe University of Chicago. He is an awesome debater. He isalso gracious and friendly. Born in 1912, he grew upin Rahway, New Jersey, where he attended local publicschools. He graduated from Rutgers University in the midstof the Great Depression in 1932. He then went to studyeconomics at the University of Chicago, where he met fellowgraduate student Rose Director whom he later married. Fornearly 10 years after he left Chicago, he worked atgovernment agencies and research institutes (with one yearvisiting at the University of Wisconsin and one year at theUniversity of Minnesota) before taking a faculty position atthe University of Chicago in 1946. He remained at Chicagountil he retired in 1977 at the age of 65, and he then movedto the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Ihave always found Milton and Rose to be gregarious,energetic people, who genuinely enjoy interacting withothers, and who enjoy life in all its dimensions, from walksnear the Pacific Ocean to surfs on the World Wide Web. Theday of this interview was no exception. It took place on May 2, 2000, in Milton s office in their San Franciscoapartment. The interview lasted for two-and-a-half <b>hours.</b> Atape <b>recorder</b> and some economic charts were on the deskbetween us. Behind Milton was a floor-to-ceiling picturewindow with beautiful panoramic views of the San Franciscohills and skyline. Behind me were his bookcases stuffed withhis books, papers, and mementos. The interview beganin a rather unplanned way. When we walked into his officeMilton started talking enthusiastically about the chartsthat were on his desk. The charts which he hadrecently prepared from data he had downloaded from theInternet raised questions about some remarks that Ihad given at a conference several weeks before whichhe had read about on the Internet. As we begantalking about the charts, I asked if I could turn on thetape recorder, since one of the topics for the interview wasto be about how he formulated his ideas and aconversation about the ideas he was formulating right thenand there seemed like an excellent way to begin theinterview. So I turned on the tape recorder, and theinterview began. Soon we segued into the series of questionsthat I had planned in advance (but had not shown Milton inadvance). We took one break for a very pleasant lunch and(unrecorded) conversation with his wife Rose before goingback to work. After the interview, the tapes weretranscribed and the transcript was edited by me and Milton. The questions and answers were rearranged slightly to fitinto the following broad topic areas: moneygrowth, thermostats, and Alan Greenspan; causes of the great inflation and its end; early interest in economics; graduate schooland early on-the-job training; permanent income theory; return of monetary economics; fiscal and monetary policy rules; use of models in monetary economics; use of time-series methods; real business-cycle models, calibration, anddetrending; natural rate hypothesis; role of debates in monetary economics; capitalism and freedom today; monetary unions and flexible exchange rates. ...|$|R
