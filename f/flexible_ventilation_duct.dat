To address this issue industry has invested substantial resources in developing technologies such as continuous haulage and bolting cycle automation. There has been limited focus on improvement of ancillary development processes and technologies such as the provision of face and panel services and the panel advance process. A monorail system has been in use for some years at Mandalong Mine near Lake Macquarie in N. S. W. The Macquarie Monorail system is an integrated gate road development services unit and differs from many existing monorail units employed in underground operations as {{it is designed to}} manage all face services while as well as carrying heavy panel plant such as the section load centre and auxiliary fan. Use of the system at the Mandalong Mine has resulted in increased productivity and safety performance during gate road development. Reductions in service move and operating delay times of 32 % and 25 % were observed respectively along with a 70 % reduction in manual handling injuries.

The measured and expected virgin rock temperatures are 48 °C at the main tipple 1000 m below surface and 58 °C at the main loading loop 1500 m below surface.

40|$|Abstract. For {{the complex}} status of fluid flow in stator radial <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducts</b> of large turbo-generator, the {{temperature}} distribution of stator is dramatically {{affected by the}} flow status of cooling medium in stator ventilating ducts. In this paper, a new ventilating ducts structure in stator is investigated. According to fixing a wind deflector on the stator teeth adjacent to the <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducts,</b> the fluid flow status of cooling air is changed flowing in stator <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducts.</b> For this reason, the effect of heat transfer in stator is changed. Taking an air-cooled turbo-generator as an example, considering the characteristics of fluid flow and heat transfer in turbo-generator ventilation system, the three-dimensional fluid flow and heat transfer coupling model is established. Using finite volume method, three-dimensional fluid field and temperature field control equations are coupling solved. Based on this, the velocity distribution in ventilating ducts is obtained. Besides that, the velocity distribution is studied with the cooling air flows into radial <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducts</b> at different incident angles. The influences of wind deflector and incident angles on the fluid velocity and temperature distribution are analyzed. Based on that, some useful conclusions are obtained...|$|R
