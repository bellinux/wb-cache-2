60|$|A cotton-planter's {{estimate}} of the average margin of profit on planting, in his section: One man and mule will raise ten acres of cotton, giving ten bales cotton, worth, say, $500; cost of producing, say $350; net profit, $150, or $15 per acre. There is also a profit now from the cotton-seed, which formerly had little value--none where much transportation was necessary. In sixteen hundred pounds crude cotton four hundred are lint, worth, say, ten cents a pound; and twelve hundred pounds of seed, worth $12 or $13 per ton. Maybe in future even the stems will not be thrown away. Mr. Edward Atkinson says that for each bale of cotton there are fifteen hundred pounds of stems, and that these are very rich in phosphate of lime and potash; that when ground and mixed with <b>ensilage</b> or cotton-seed meal (which is too rich for use as fodder in large quantities), the stem mixture makes a superior food, rich in all the elements needed {{for the production of}} milk, meat, and bone. Heretofore the stems have been considered a nuisance.|$|E

Dotting it were numerous circular towers, dome-capped, and surrounding each tower was a stone wall enclosing several acres of ground. The valley {{appeared to be in}} a high state of cultivation. Upon {{the opposite side of the}} hill and just beneath her was a tower and enclosure. It was the roof of the former that had first attracted her attention. In all respects it seemed identical in construction with those further out in the valley--a high, plastered wall of massive construction surrounding a similarly constructed tower, upon whose gray surface was painted in vivid colors a strange device. The towers were about forty sofads in diameter, approximately forty earth-feet, and sixty in height to the base of the dome. To an Earth man they would have immediately suggested the silos in which dairy farmers store <b>ensilage</b> for their herds; but closer scrutiny, revealing an occasional embrasured opening together with the strange construction of the domes, would have altered such a conclusion. Tara of Helium saw that the domes seemed to be faced with innumerable prisms of glass, those that were exposed to the declining sun scintillating so gorgeously as to remind her suddenly of the magnificent trappings of Gahan of Gathol.

The price per nutritive value is lowest {{as compared to}} other forages. Preservation of fodders beets demands thorough cleaning without damaging and regularly occurs as a whole in well closed piles. In addition, feeding them to the animals is labour demanding. These disadvantages enforce the research towards other preservation methods which {{may be able to}} valorise this valuable type of roughage. The preservation of fodder beets in silages using silo bags, either separately or in combination with maize was investigated. Fodder beets were harvested and <b>ensilaged</b> at the ideal moment of maize harvest (October) or fodder beets were harvested at the ideal moment for fodder beet harvest (November) and consequently <b>ensilaged</b> with previously <b>ensilaged</b> maize. Highest energy yields of the silages were recorded at optimal harvest time for fodder beets. <b>Ensilaging</b> fodder beets separately resulted in large energy losses due to effluent and dry matter losses. Using lab scale silage, possible solutions for these large losses were investigated. Addition of 10 % maize did reduce the effluent losses but dry matter losses remained at a high level. Addition of 4, 5 l propionic acid per ton beets reduced effluent and dry matter losses sufficiently. <b>Ensilaging</b> foliage was another point of interest.

25|$|Maize is a {{major source}} of both grain feed and fodder for {{livestock}}. It is fed to the livestock in various ways. When it is used as a grain crop, the dried kernels are used as feed. They are often kept on the cob for storage in a corn crib, or they may be shelled off for storage in a grain bin. The farm that consumes the feed may produce it, purchase it on the market, or some of both. When the grain is used for feed, the rest of the plant (the corn stover) can be used later as fodder, bedding (litter), or soil amendment. When the whole maize plant (grain plus stalks and leaves) is used for fodder, it is usually chopped all at once and <b>ensilaged,</b> as digestibility and palatability are higher in the <b>ensilaged</b> form than in the dried form. Maize silage {{is one of the most}} valuable forages for ruminants. Before the advent of widespread <b>ensilaging,</b> it was traditional to gather the corn into shocks after harvesting, where it dried further. With or without a subsequent move to the cover of a barn, it was then stored for weeks to several months until fed to the livestock. Today <b>ensilaging</b> can occur not only in siloes but also in silage wrappers. However, in the tropics maize can be harvested year-round and fed as green forage to the animals.|$|R

40|$|Introduction Ensiling {{is one of}} {{the common}} {{preserving}} methods for forage or other organic materials. In this method, organic matters were preserved by proving an aerobic condition and then by reducing the pH with increasing acids production (mainly lactic acid). Some circumstances like enough soluble carbohydrates, low buffering capacity and appropriate dry matter concentration are needed in <b>ensilages</b> for an ideal silage production. Seepage production during ensiling {{is one of the}} most problems especially when high moisture materials (like fresh beet sugar pulp) are ensiled. Silage seepage can pollute the environment and make loses in nutrients like soluble carbohydrates, protein, organic acids and etc. Moreover, lactic acid bacteria inoculants (Mainly consist of Lactobacillus plantarum) have been widely used for improving fermentation pattern in <b>ensilages.</b> These external provided bacteria usually enhance lactic acid production in silage and then accelerate the falling of pH values in silages. Rapid decrease in pH can inhibit non-beneficial bacteria from activity which finally preserves nutrients from un-necessary fermentation or oxidation. The aim of this study was to investigate the interactive effects of lactic acid bacteria inoculants and some absorbents (straw and pith) on chemical properties and fermentation profile of wet sugar beet pulp silage.

50|$|The crops {{suitable}} for <b>ensilage</b> are the ordinary grasses, clovers, alfalfa, vetches, oats, rye and maize; various weeds {{may also be}} stored in silos, notably spurrey such as Spergula arvensis. Silage must be made from plant material with a suitable moisture content: about 50% to 60% depending on the means of storage, the degree of compression, {{and the amount of}} water that will be lost in storage, but not exceeding 75%. Weather during harvest need not be as fair and dry as when harvesting for drying. For corn, harvest begins when the whole-plant moisture is at a suitable level, ideally a few days before it is ripe. For pasture-type crops, the grass is mowed and allowed to wilt for a day or so until the moisture content drops to a suitable level. Ideally the crop is mowed when in full flower, and deposited in the silo on the day of its cutting.|$|E

Furthermore, it can ensure good yields of quality green forage and the rest quantity can be <b>ensilaged.</b> In that way, higher yields of quality forage per hectare can be provided during vegetation season. The aim of this research, carried out in 2003 and 2004 at the Faculty of Agriculture in Zagreb, was to determine green matter yield, dry matter yield and forage quality of forage sorghum (hybrids Grazer N) at different development stages. The highest forage sorghum green mass (90, 70 t ha- 1) and dry matter yields (27, 40 t ha- 1) were obtained in panicles. The highest contents of crude proteins (13, 35 %) were obtained at the forage sorghum height of 100 cm and significantly decreased until panicles. Crude fibres contents (31, 20 %) significantly decreased until panicles...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{evaluates the}} quality of model silages made of wilted grass biomass and treated with silage additives. Grass species used for the {{production}} of silages were Lolium perenne, Festulolium pabulare and Festulolium braunii harvested in the first cut at the stage of earing. The assessed grass species were wilted after the cut for an identical time 36 hours (2008), resp. 24 hours (2009). The treatment was made either with a chemical preparation (formic acid, propionic acid, ammonium formate) and/or with a bio­lo­gi­cal inoculant (Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus acidilactici, Lactobacillus salivarius, cellulase, hemicellulase and amylase). The amount of the chemical ingredient was 4 [*]l .  t− 1 and the amount of the biological additive was 10 [*]g .  t− 1. The biomass was after wilting <b>ensilaged</b> in con­tai­ners whose diameter and height were 0. 15 [*]m and 0. 64 [*]m, respectively. After 60 days of <b>ensilaging,</b> the silages were assessed for pH, organic acids content, ethanol content and acidity of water extract (AWE); organic nutrients assessed in the silages were crude fibre (CF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), crude protein (CP) and digestibility of organic matter (DOM). Hygienic safety was assessed from the contents of zearalenon, fumonisin and aflatoxin mycotoxins. The high (P < 0. 05) dry matter (DM) content in Festulolium pabulare silages indicates that the species tends to rapid wilting. The higher DM content reflected in lower biomass losses (P < 0. 05). The lowest pH values (P < 0. 05) were detected in silages made of Festulolium braunii. The fact relates to the higher content of lactic acid in the prepared microsilages. The use of ensiling additives affected {{the quality of}} extracts. Namely the application of the biological additive led to the increased content (P < 0. 05) of not only lactic acid but acetic acid too. Titrable acidity was not affected by the ensiling additives. As to the emanation of ethanol, heterofermentative bacteria of lactic fermentation apparently took part in the fermentation process of the silages as well. While the evaluated forage species showed differences in the di­ges­ti­bi­li­ty of organic matter (P < 0. 05), the application of preservatives did not influence the content of organic nutrients. Fumonisin was not detected at all and aflatoxins were below the level of detection. None of the assessed factors had an effect on the content of zearalenon; in spite of the fact, an apparent tendency towards a higher content of zearalenon was recorded in Lolium perenne...|$|R
