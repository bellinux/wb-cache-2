50|$|The {{concept of}} BGP {{hijacking}} revolves around locating an ISP {{that is not}} filtering advertisements (intentionally or otherwise) or locating an ISP whose internal or ISP-to-ISP BGP session is susceptible to a man-in-the-middle attack. Once located, an attacker can potentially advertise any prefix they want, causing some or all traffic to be diverted from the real source towards the attacker. This can be done either to overload the ISP the attacker has infiltrated, or to perform a DoS or <b>impersonation</b> <b>attack</b> on the entity whose prefix is being advertised. It {{is not uncommon for}} an attacker to cause serious outages, up to and including a complete loss of connectivity. In early 2008, at least eight US Universities had their traffic diverted to Indonesia for about 90 minutes one morning in an attack kept mostly quiet by those involved. Also, in February 2008, a large portion of YouTube's address space was redirected to Pakistan when the PTA decided to block access to the site from inside the country, but accidentally blackholed the route in the global BGP table.|$|E

40|$|People {{have long}} been aware of {{malicious}} users that imper-sonate celebrities or launch identity theft attacks in social networks. However, beyond anecdotal evidence, {{there have been no}} in-depth studies of <b>impersonation</b> <b>attacks</b> in today’s social networks. One reason for the lack of studies in this space is the absence of datasets about impersonation at-tacks. To this end, we propose a technique to build extensive datasets of <b>impersonation</b> <b>attacks</b> in current social networks and we gather 16, 572 cases of <b>impersonation</b> <b>attacks</b> in the Twitter social network. Our analysis reveals that most iden-tity <b>impersonation</b> <b>attacks</b> are not targeting celebrities or identity theft. Instead, we uncover a new class of imperson-ation attacks that clone the profiles of ordinary people on Twitter to create real-looking fake identities and use them in malicious activities such as follower fraud. We refer to these as the doppelgänger bot attacks. Our findings show (i) that identity <b>impersonation</b> <b>attacks</b> are much broader than believed and can impact any user, not just celebrities and (ii) that attackers are evolving and create real-looking ac-counts that are harder to detect by current systems. We also propose and evaluate methods to automatically detect <b>impersonation</b> <b>attacks</b> sooner than they are being detected in today’s Twitter social network. 1...|$|R
40|$|Today, users {{sign on to}} most online social {{networking}} sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ via weak identities, i. e., unverified identities {{that do not require}} users to prove that their online identities match their offline (real world) personalities. Weak identities leave the sites vulnerable to a variety of fake identity or Sybil attacks. In this paper, we focus on identity <b>impersonation</b> <b>attacks,</b> a special class of Sybil (fake identity) attacks where the attacker spoofs (as-sumes) the identity of another real-world user. As more and more personal data about users becomes publicly available on the Web, <b>impersonation</b> <b>attacks</b> become easier to carry out. Identity <b>impersonation</b> <b>attacks</b> can be particularly dam-aging for the victim’s online reputation. As people’s on-line data is increasingly aggregated by search engines [1] and used for a variety of purposes including evaluating their suitability for employment [2], <b>impersonation</b> <b>attacks,</b> par-ticularly those that go undetected, can have serious adverse consequences for the victims, even in the offline world. Fur-ther, social engineering attacks launched using impersonated identities can result in material and financial losses for the victim as well as the victim’s friends [3]. Despite the serious threat posed by impersonation at-tacks [4, 5] and the woeful state of defenses against the attacks, few research studies, to date, have systematically studied <b>impersonation</b> <b>attacks</b> in online social networks. We argue that the current state of affairs is largely due to the difficulty in gathering extensive ground truth data about im-personation attacks in the real-world. Beyond a few anec-dotal examples that are reported in the popular press, we lack large datasets about <b>impersonation</b> <b>attacks</b> in online social networks {{that can be used to}} characterize and detect identities participating in such attacks. In this paper, we take the fist step toward understanding and detecting <b>impersonation</b> <b>attacks</b> by presenting a novel method that allows to gather extensive ground truth of im-personation attacks in current social networks. § 2 gives the key idea behind our method and § 3 presents some prelimi-nary results on characterizing <b>impersonation</b> <b>attacks...</b>|$|R

They also developed new schemes {{to enhance the}} security of Arshad et al.’s scheme. Later, Irshad et al.

Recently, Zhang et al. (2014) proposed a new password-based SIP authentication protocol, but Tu et al. (2015), Irshad et al. (2015) and Wu et al. (2013) showed that Zhang et al.’s protocol is vulnerable to the <b>impersonation</b> <b>attack,</b> and they proposed improved protocols respectively. After that, Arshad and Nikooghadam (2016) showed that Irshad et al.’s scheme is still vulnerable to <b>impersonation</b> <b>attack.</b> Farash (2016) and Mishra et al. (2016) found that Tu et al.’s protocol cannot resist the <b>impersonation</b> <b>attack,</b> and also presented improved schemes.

To enhance the security, they proposed a privacy preserving authentication scheme for SIP. Kumari et al. (2015) argued that Farash’s protocol cannot withstand <b>impersonation</b> <b>attack,</b> password guessing attack, and session-specific temporary information attack. Further, Kumari et al. proposed an improved protocol to fix the weaknesses of Farash’s protocol.|$|E

In the literature, the performance of RF fingerprinting techniques is typically assessed using high-end (expensive) receiver hardware.

This paper evaluates the accuracy of RF fingerprinting employing low-end receivers. The vulnerability to an <b>impersonation</b> <b>attack</b> is assessed for a modulation-based RF fingerprinting system employing low-end commodity hardware (by legitimate and malicious users alike).
