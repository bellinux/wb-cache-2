The locomotory behavior of adults from a normal and a clone population was studied in the Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor (TM) along with growth and reproduction to determine how different sediment types may affect this worm and <b>forced</b> <b>clones</b> during testing. Four different sand size classes were established by sieving: fine (2 mm), and whole sediment. Locomotory activity was highest in fine and then in coarse sediment, while in whole and medium sediment size classes worms grew and reproduced less, and had lower locomotory activity levels.

40|$|An emm-like gene (emmL) and a fcrA gene {{from group}} A streptococcal strain 64 / 14 (emmL 64 / 14 and fcrA 64 / 14) were amplified by PCR and <b>force</b> <b>cloned</b> into the heat-inducible {{expression}} vector pJLA 602. The emmL gene encoded a recombinant protein that bound human IgG 1, IgG 2, and IgG 4 in a nonimmune fashion. This is the reactivity {{profile of a}} type IIa IgG-binding protein. The emmL 64 / 14 gene product was antigenically similar to the previously identified high-molecular-weight type IIa IgG-binding protein of strain 64 / 14 and had an N-terminal sequence identical {{to that of the}} wild-type protein. The fcrA gene also encoded a recombinant protein with type IIa functional activity. This protein was similar to the lower-molecular-weight type IIa IgG-binding protein previously isolated from strain 64 / 14 and was antigenically distinct from the higher-molecular-weight type IIa protein encoded by the emmL 64 / 14 gene. The sequences for both genes including the intervening regions are presented. The emmL gene demonstrates significant homology to other class I emm and emmL genes expressed by opacity factor-negative group A streptococcal isolates. The fcrA gene was found to be homologous to other fcrA genes normally present in opacity factor-positive group A isolates. The sequence upstream of the fcrA gene and the intervening sequence between the end of the fcrA gene and the start of the emmL gene were similar to those reported for other fcrA genes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the past {{evolution of the}} orbital elements of comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, target of the Rosetta spacecraft. The gravitational orbit of the comet {{is affected by the}} sublimation of ice from the nucleus that triggers non-gravitational forces. The comet also experienced several close encounters with Jupiter especially in 1959 and 1923 (less than 1 AU). These perturbations cause the chaoticity of the comet orbit at short time scale. The goal {{of this paper is to}} have a precise idea of the comet recent dynamical history. This is done in studying the mean trends of the comet orbital elements and also in characterizing its chaotic motion with the Fast Lyapunov indicator. To compute these mean trends, two sets (considering or not the non-gravitational <b>forces)</b> of 1000 <b>clone</b> orbits of the comet were considered. This paper shows that the last close encounter with Jupiter on February 4 ^th, 1959 drastically modified the orbital elements of the comet (especially the perihelion distance from more than 2. 7 AU prior the encounter to 1. 3 AU after the encounter). The motion of the comet is also shown to be chaotic before the close encounter with Jupiter on October 2 ^nd, 1923. The mean trends of the orbital elements of the comet are also presented in this paper (for two time scales : 275 years in the past and 10, 000 years in the past) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe LGI 1 gene {{suppresses}} {{invasion in}} glioma cells and predisposes to epilepsy. In a gene expression array comparison between parental cells and T 98 G cell <b>clones</b> <b>forced</b> to express LGI 1, we {{demonstrate that the}} canonical axon guidance pathway is the most significantly affected. In particular, aspects of axon guidance that involve reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, which is also involved in cell movement and invasion, were affected. Analysis of actin fiber organization using fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that different T 98 G cell clones expressing the exogenous LGI 1 gene show high levels of stress fibers compared with controls. Since stress fiber formation is associated with loss of cell mobility, we used scratch wound assays to demonstrate that LGI 1 -expressing clones show {{a significant reduction in}} cell mobility. LGI 1 reexpression also resulted in loss of the PDGFRA and EGFR proteins, suggesting a rapid turnover of these receptors despite increased mRNA levels for PDGFRA. LGI 1 suppression of invasion is associated with loss of ERK/MAPK 1 activation. LGI 1 is a secreted protein, and when the culture supernatant from cells expressing FLAG- and GFP-tagged proteins were applied to parental T 98 G cells, ERK/MAPK 1 phosphorylation and cell mobility was suppressed, demonstrating that the LGI 1 protein acts as a suppressive agent for cell movement in this assay. These observations support a previous suggestion that LGI 1 can reduce cellular invasion in in vitro assays and, as a secreted agent, may be developed as a means of treating metastatic cancer. In addition, this observation provides a mechanistic link for LGI 1 's common role in metastasis and epilepsy development...|$|R

However, Optimus Prime, returned to health by Smokescreen's use of the Forge of Solus Prime, attacks Darkmount, defeating Megatron in one on one combat in the air and destroying the fortress' fusion cannons so that the military can destroy the fortress. Forced to use the Nemesis as their base once again, Megatron begins sending units to hunt down Predacon fossils in the hope of gaining an advantage over the Autobots through cloning an army. The return of the Predacon (Predaking himself) adds to this advantage. However, the Decepticon ranks are thinned when Starscream and Knock Out accidentally turn Cylas into a Terrorcon that can turn other Decepticons into Energon vampires through a mixture of Synthetic and Dark Energon. This plague also leads to Airachnid's escape and her retaking control of the Insecticons, forcing Soundwave to teleport her armada to one of Cybertron's moon's and leaving them to be eaten by her as she has become a Terrorcon hybrid. This accident <b>forces</b> the <b>cloning</b> process to be sped up on Project Predacon due to the loss of more than half of Megatron's forces. However, Project Predacon is terminated when Predaking reveals he is capable of higher thought as well as transformation, forcing Megatron to lure the Autobots into destroying the cloning laboratory for him. With the destruction of the lab, it is revealed that Predacon CNA combined with Synthetic Energon is capable of producing cybermatter. Attention is then focused on the restoration of the Omega Lock and the completion of the Synthetic Energon formula. To complete it, Ratchet is kidnapped and forced to aid in completing the formula, at which he succeeds. Megatron however does not count on Ratchet turning Predaking against him, nor the Autobots assaulting the Nemesis. With this, Megatron rallies his troops for a final stand. Though he kills Bumblebee and nearly kills Optimus, Megatron is killed by a resurrected Bumblebee who emerges from the Omega Lock and stabs him in the spark with the Star Saber, sending him tumbling to the earth far below.

40|$|Glioblastoma multiforme is a {{malignant}} brain tumor characterized by heterogeneity. Interactions between heterogeneous tumor cells {{are supposed to}} affect the behavior of awhole tumor cell population. In this thesis an in vitro model system of clonal glioma celllines originating from one glioblastoma tumor was used, and the behavior of cells incocultures was studied and compared the behavior of cells grown separately. The resultsindicate the presence of two types of interactions. In one, paracrine signals acted via extra-cellular media. This was associated with increased growth of the whole co-culture followedby a selective <b>force</b> driving one <b>clone</b> to dominance. In the other type, the cell clones grewside by side without signs of paracrine signalling, in a balance resulting in an increasedterminal cell density. Further investigations focused on mechanisms of interactions in thiscombination. Two cell clones were chosen, a GFAP+ and a GFAP-, for further experiments. Withdifferential display PCR {{it was possible to}} investigate their specific gene expressionpatterns. Seventeen cDNA fragments were differentially expressed, among them twocorresponded to known transcription factors, ATF 3 and prox- 1, one to a cytoskeletal protein,α-tropomyosin.

50|$|A monthly Star Fox comic strip, {{illustrated}} by Benimaru Itoh, was printed in issues 45 to 55 of Nintendo Power in 1993. It was {{an adaptation of}} the events of the original Star Fox, with some exclusive characters not currently seen in any of the games to date. One such character was Fara Phoenix, a vixen who becomes the fifth member of Star Fox after they saved her from Venomian forces, who forms a close relationship with Fox. The story followed the Star Fox team as they went from outlaws on Papetoon, to an elite Arwing fighter squadron. Fox, Falco, and Andross were the only 3 characters whose backgrounds were fully explained in the story. A sequel set after the events of the game was produced in Nintendo Power by the same team which continued the story, featuring Andross 's DNA being split between two clones. The clones then begin an invasion of the Lylat system, laying waste to everything in their path. The Star Fox team springs back into action, while Fara— dressed in clothing once worn by Fox's deceased mother, as the team had been enjoying some down time when the invasion begins— manages to provide an accidental, yet significant, distraction to one of the Andross clones when he spots her on a monitor due to a revelation that the original Andross was in love with Fox's mother and accidentally murdered her with a bomb intended for Fox's father, which the clone says over a loudspeaker, as the clone believes he is speaking to the deceased vixen, rather than Fara. Enraged by this new knowledge, Fox battles his way through the <b>forces</b> of Andross' <b>clones,</b> one of whom slays the other as he considers the feelings of the one who believes Fara to be Fox's mother is a weakness that is unneeded, and destroys the survivor.

40|$|My {{dissertation}} encompasses {{three studies}} of social behavior. Two explore the reproductive conflicts that occur between cooperating individuals. I examine conflict at two levels: within colonies {{of the social}} wasp, Eustenogaster fraterna, and within chimeric multicellular organisms formed by the social amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum. The third project investigates the occurrence of sexual reproduction in a natural population of D. discoideum. Eustenogaster fraterna belongs to the basal eusocial family of stenogastrine wasps. Colonies are small averaging only 2. 7 adult females but only one mated female. I examined the reproductive and genetic structure of 18 colonies by genotyping all within-colony individuals and assessing the ovarian development of females. My results show that 85 % of females were potential reproducers. Adult females were not related as full sisters. Some brood could not be assigned {{to any of the}} adult females, suggesting that subordinate females could inherit the nest and replace the dominant female. D. discoideum live as free-living, single cells, but when starved they aggregate to form a multicellular fruiting body. Genetically distinct clones of D. discoideum co-aggregate to form genetic chimeras. 20 % of cells form the stalk of the fruiting body and die, while others become reproductive spores. One clone can exploit the other by contributing less than its proportional share to the sterile stalk. I investigated whether cheating is a strategy dependent on the relative proportion of the clones aggregating. In a chimera, a rare clone could benefit by avoiding forming the stalk because it is less related to the reproductive part. My results do not support the frequency-dependence strategy. I investigated the occurrence of sexual reproduction in a natural population of D. discoideum, using the approach of estimating linkage disequilibrium in the population at one site. My results show that recombination does occur and is due to sexual reproduction not to parasexuality. In sum, conflicts within societies can be mitigated. E. fraterna workers gain insurance advantages by obtaining indirect genetic benefits or inheritance of work <b>force.</b> D. discoideum <b>clones</b> gain cheating advantages either when rare or common in the aggregation. Recombination yields novel genotypes; this might increase the complexity of interactions between co-aggregating clones...|$|R
