5|$|The country's {{principal}} {{language is}} Kinyarwanda, which is spoken by most Rwandans. The major European languages {{during the colonial}} era were German, and then French, which was introduced by Belgium and remained an official and widely spoken language after independence.

Kinyarwanda, English, and French are all official languages. Kinyarwanda {{is the language of}} government and English is the primary educational medium. Swahili, the lingua franca of the East African Community, is also spoken by some as a second language, particularly returned refugees from Kenya and Tanzania.

5|$|In 1964, {{preparations}} {{began to}} raise the school leaving age to 16. These were delayed in 1968, and eventually the decision was taken in 1971 that the new upper age limit be enforced from 1 September 1972 onwards. As well as raising the school leaving age in 1972, the year also saw {{the introduction of the}} Education (Work Experience) Act, allowing LEAs to organise work experience for the additional final year school students. In some counties around the country, these changes also led to the introduction of middle schools in 1968, where students were kept at primary or junior school for an additional year, meaning that the number of students <b>in</b> <b>secondary</b> <b>schools</b> within these areas remained virtually constant through the change. In others, more radical changes led to middle schools for pupils aged up to 13 opening in smaller secondary school buildings, with other schools accommodating students over 13. As of 2010, there are fewer than 300 middle schools across England, situated in just 22 local education authorities; the number of remaining middle schools has gradually fallen since the mid-1980s.|$|E
