25|$|Classical {{music has}} had some {{influence}} on the sound of Tangerine Dream over the years. György Ligeti, Johann Sebastian Bach, Maurice Ravel, and Arcangelo Corelli are clearly visible as dominant influences in the early albums. A Baroque sensibility sometimes informs the more coordinated sequencer patterns, which has its most direct expression in the La Folia section that comes {{at the very end}} of the title track of <b>Force</b> <b>Majeure.</b> In live performances, the piano solos often directly quoted from Romantic classical works for piano, such as the Beethoven and Mozart snippets in much of the late '70s- early '80s stage shows. In the bootleg recording of the Mannheim Mozartsaal concert of 1976 (Tangerine Tree volume 13), the first part of the first piece also clearly quotes from Franz Liszt's Totentanz. The first phrase is played on a harpsichord synthesizer patch, and is answered by the second half of the phrase in a flute voicing on a Mellotron. During the 90s, many releases included recordings of classical compositions: Pictures at an Exhibition (on Turn of the Tides), Largo (from Xerxes) (on Tyranny of Beauty), Symphony in A Minor (by J. S. Bach), and Concerto in A Major / Adagio (by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) (both on Ambient Monkeys).|$|E

2500|$|The term {{treasure}} trove {{is often used}} metaphorically to mean a [...] "valuable find", and hence a source of treasure, or a reserve or repository of valuable things.

Treasure trove is therefore akin to similar Anglo-French or Anglo-French-derived legal terms whereby a post-positive adjective in a noun phrase (contrary to standard English syntax) has been reanalysed as a compound noun phrase, as in court martial, <b>force</b> <b>majeure,</b> and Princess Royal. Phrases of this form are often used either with the etymologically correct plural form (for example, [...] "Courts-martial deal with serious offences ...") or as fully rederived plural forms (such as [...] "... ordering court-martials ..."). In the case of {{treasure trove}}, the typical plural form is almost always treasure troves, with treasures trove found mostly in historical or literary works.|$|E

In an interview on 22 June, Prime Minister Jean Eyeghé Ndong appeared to confirm this speculation, saying that [...] "it seems certain that it will take us more than 45 days".

2500|$|The {{opposition}} was also {{supported by a}} perception by local Welsh people that a pipeline like {{this would not be}} permitted in England, raising echoes of the infamous drowning of Capel Celyn for a reservoir.

Planning decisions were pushed through, {{as in the case of}} the Cilfrew Pressure Reduction Installation which was approved only by excluding certain protesting councillors from the vote, a process deemed illegal by a high court judge saying [...] "it is a wonder that anybody votes on anything". The result of this decision led the National Grid to declare a <b>force</b> <b>majeure</b> notice in April 2007 to avoid any responsibility for any delays in gas delivery. In June 2007 a High Court ruling meant the Brecon protest camp featuring tree houses and tunnels open since January was closed down with a number of protestors arrested and substantial local disruption to roads.

2500|$|Early {{common law}} cases held that {{performance}} of a contract always had to take place. No matter what hardship was encountered contracting parties had absolute liability on their obligations. In the 19th century the courts developed a doctrine that contracts which became impossible to perform would be frustrated and automatically come to an end. In Taylor v Caldwell Blackburn J held that when the Surrey Gardens Music Hall unexpectedly burnt down, the owners did not have to pay compensation to the business that had leased it for an extravagant performance, because it was neither party's fault. An assumption underlying all contracts (a [...] "condition precedent") is that they are possible to perform. People would not ordinarily contract to do something they knew was going to be impossible. Apart from physical impossibility, frustration could be down to a contract becoming illegal to perform, for instance if war breaks out and the government bans trade to a belligerent country, or perhaps if the whole purpose of an agreement is destroyed by another event, like renting a room to watch a cancelled coronation parade. But a contract is not frustrated merely because a subsequent event makes the agreement harder to perform than expected, as for instance in Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham UDC where a builder unfortunately had to spend more time and money doing a job than he would be paid for because of an unforeseen shortage of labour and supplies. The House of Lords denied his claim for contract to be declared frustrated so he could claim quantum meruit. Because the doctrine of frustration is a matter of construction of the contract, it can be contracted around, through what are called [...] "force majeure" [...] clauses. Similarly, a contract can have a <b>force</b> <b>majeure</b> clause that would bring a contract to an end more easily than would common law construction. In The Super Servant Two Wijsmuller BV contracted to hire out a self-propelling barge to J. Lauritzen A/S, who wanted to tow another ship from Japan to Rotterdam, but had a provision stating the contract would terminate if some event made it difficult related to the 'perils or dangers and accidents of the sea'. Wijsmuller BV also had a choice of whether to provide either The Superservant One or Two. They chose Two and it sank. The Court of Appeal held that the impossibility to perform the agreement was down to Wijsmuller's own choice, and so it was not frustrated, but that the <b>force</b> <b>majeure</b> clause did cover it. The effect of a contract being frustrated is that it is that both parties are prospectively discharged from performing their side of the bargain. If one side has already paid money over or conferred another valuable benefit, but not got anything in return yet, contrary to the prior common law position, the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 gives the court discretion to let the claimant recover a 'just sum', and that means whatever the court thinks fit in all the circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|Western Australian-based mining {{companies}} could have potentially lost {{hundreds of millions}} of dollars, because the state is the world's largest producer of iron ore and one of the largest producers of gold and nickel, exporting $48.4billion of minerals and energy in 2006. Three days after the blast, the world's largest mining company, BHP Billiton, said it was assessing the gas shortage's impact, but its iron ore mines at Mount Newman and Nickel West were running normally. On 13 June, BHP Billiton brought forward the closure of its nickel smelter in Kalgoorlie by four months, which increased its gas supplies for its Worsley Alumina refinery. A spokesperson for Rio Tinto, the world's third-largest mining company, said the company was prioritising its power usage and using diesel and other alternative fuels for its mines, shipping terminals and railways. The world's third-biggest gold producer, Newmont Mining, said it was [...] "investigating alternative gas and energy sources", and Iluka Resources, the largest zircon producer, shut down its Western Australian operations on 5 June and said it was awaiting advice from power supplier Alinta Gas. Oxiana Limited, soon to be the world's second-largest zinc producer, used standby diesel power at its Golden Grove mine until 6 June, when they obtained an alternative source. Newcrest Mining, a gold mining company located at Telfer, switched to its limited stockpile of diesel fuel. [...] Fonterra Co-operative Group also switched to diesel power. Minara Resources, the country's second-largest nickel producer, was [...] "using the time opportunistically on plant maintenance", as natural gas was its Murrin Murrin mine's only energy source.
