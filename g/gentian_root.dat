40|$|Background: <b>Gentian</b> <b>roots</b> {{have been}} used as a herbal {{medicine}} because of their anti-inflammatory activities. However, the molecular mechanisms of these anti-inflammatory effects remain to be completely explained. Methods and Findings: Here, we investigated anti-inflammatory effects of <b>gentian</b> <b>roots</b> and showed that root extracts from Gentiana triflora inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced expression of TNF-a in RAW 264. 7 cells. The extracts also contained swertiamarin and gentiopicroside, which are the major active compounds of gentian roots; however, neither compound had any effect on LPS-induced TNF-a production in our test system. We isolated gentiolactone as an inhibitor of TNF-a production from the extracts. Gentiolactone also inhibited LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase- 2 (Cox- 2) expression at the mRNA level. Moreover, gentiolactone suppressed NF-kB transcriptional activity without inhibition of IkB degradation or NF-kB nuclear transport. Conclusions: Our results indicate that inhibition of TNF-a, iNOS and Cox- 2 expression by gentiolactone is one of the mechanisms of the anti-inflammatory properties of <b>gentian</b> <b>roots...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Gentian</b> <b>root</b> has a {{long history}} of use as an herbal bitter and is an {{ingredient}} of many proprietary medicines. The parts used include the dried, underground parts of the plant and the fresh, above-ground parts.

Caution should be exercised as to its use because it is endangered, and the closely related Centaurium erythraea shares many of its constituents and actions.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{perception}} that the spirit is produced with gentian flowers (which are depicted in the labeling by many producers), Gentian is actually produced using <b>gentian</b> <b>root,</b> most commonly the yellow gentian, which is a larger variety.

The harvesting of gentian from the wild is strictly controlled; as a result, fields are planted with the specific purpose of being harvested. In both the EU and Switzerland, the alcoholic strength of Gentian must be at least 37.5 percent alcohol by volume.|$|E
