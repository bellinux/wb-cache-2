Prior to the publication of the story, <b>Early</b> <b>Action</b> applications were up 7.5 percent with 16,187 applicants. However overall applications were down 0.7 percent to 31,107 {{in the aftermath of the}} publication.|$|E
5|$|Emergency centers were prepped {{across the}} {{northern}} Cook Islands on February8. The Cook Islands Chapter of the Red Cross took <b>early</b> <b>action</b> with Cyclone Pat and began stockpiling relief supplies on February9. Volunteers {{from the organization}} assisted elderly residents with preparation and evacuation on Aitutaki. Anticipating high winds, residents tied down homes with rope and wire and boarded up windows with shutters. Similar preparations took place on Rarotonga, though the main concern there was storm surge. Government offices and schools there were closed on February11. Most residents and all tourists along the coast in Aitutaki evacuated inland to designated shelters. Authorities later announced that they were under-prepared for Cyclone Pat. The lack of an official process during an emergency was cited as a core issue.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began at}} about 8 a.m. {{with the first}} allied lines attacking the village of Telnitz, which was defended by the 3rd Line Regiment. This sector of the {{battlefield}} witnessed heavy fighting in this <b>early</b> <b>action</b> as several ferocious Allied charges evicted the French from the town and forced them onto {{the other side of}} the Goldbach. The first men of Davout's corps arrived at this time and threw the Allies out of Telnitz before they too were attacked by hussars and re-abandoned the town. Additional Allied attacks out of Telnitz were checked by French artillery.|$|E

5|$|The {{undergraduate}} schools {{maintain a}} restrictive <b>Early</b> <b>Action</b> admissions program, as {{students who have}} applied through an Early Decision process at another school {{are not permitted to}} apply early to Georgetown. 94% of students accepted for the class of 2017 were in the top 10% of their class and the interquartile range of SAT scores was 700–770 in Reading/Writing and 680–780 in Math. Georgetown accepts the SAT and ACT, though it does not consider the writing portion of either test. Over 55% of undergraduates receive financial aid, and the university meets 100% of demonstrated need, with an average financial aid package of $23,500 and about 70% of aid distributed in the form of grants or scholarships.|$|E
5|$|The strong {{cultural}} {{interest in}} British castles persisted in the 20th century. In some cases this had destructive consequences as wealthy collectors bought and removed architectural features and other historical artefacts from castles {{for their own}} collections, a practice that produced significant official concern. Some of the more significant cases included St Donat's Castle, bought by William Randolph Hearst in 1925 and then decorated with numerous medieval buildings removed from their original sites around Britain, and the case of Hornby, where {{many parts of the}} castle were sold off and sent to buyers in the United States. Partially {{as a result of these}} events, increasing legal powers were introduced to protect castles – acts of parliament in 1900 and 1910 widened the terms of the earlier legislation on national monuments to allow the inclusion of castles. An act of Parliament in 1913 introduced preservation orders for the first time and these powers were extended in 1931. Similarly, after the end of the Irish Civil War, the new Irish state took <b>early</b> <b>action</b> to extend and strengthen the previous British legislation to protect Irish national monuments.|$|E

25|$|Notre Dame {{is known}} for its {{competitive}} admissions, with the incoming class enrolling in fall 2016 admitting 3,655 from a pool of 19,505 (18.7%). The academic profile of the enrolled class continues to rate among the top 10 to 15 in the nation for national research universities. Of the most recent class, the Class of 2020, 48% were in the top 1% of their high school, and 94% were in the top 10%. The median SAT score was 1510 and the median ACT score was 34. The university practices a non-restrictive <b>early</b> <b>action</b> policy that allows admitted students to consider admission to Notre Dame as well as any other colleges to which they were accepted. 1,400 of the 3,577 (39.1%) were admitted under the <b>early</b> <b>action</b> plan. Admitted students came from 1,311 high schools and the average student traveled more than 750 miles to Notre Dame, making it arguably the most representative university in the United States. While all entering students begin in the College of the First Year of Studies, 25% have indicated they plan to study in the liberal arts or social sciences, 24% in engineering, 24% in business, 24% in science, and 3% in architecture.|$|E

25|$|In September 2006, the {{university}} announced that all applicants for the Class of 2012 {{would be considered}} in a single pool, effectively ending the school's early decision program. In February 2011, following decisions by the University of Virginia and Harvard University to reinstate their early admissions programs, Princeton announced it would institute an <b>early</b> <b>action</b> program, starting with applicants for the Class of 2016. In 2011, The Business Journal rated Princeton as the most selective college in the Eastern United States in terms of admission selectivity.|$|E
25|$|Though {{many of the}} {{original}} RPGs for the PLATO mainframe system in the late 1970s also supported multiple, simultaneous players, the popularity of multiplayer modes in mainstream RPGs did not begin to rise sharply until the early to mid-1990s. For instance, Secret of Mana (1993), an <b>early</b> <b>action</b> role-playing game by Square, {{was one of the}} first commercial RPGs to feature cooperative multiplayer gameplay, offering two-player and three-player action once the main character had acquired his party members. Later, Diablo (1996) would combine CRPG and action game elements with an Internet multiplayer mode that allowed up to four players to enter the same world and fight monsters, trade items, or fight against each other.|$|E
25|$|Typically action RPGs feature {{each player}} {{directly}} controlling a single character in real time, and feature a strong focus on combat and action with plot and character interaction {{kept to a}} minimum. <b>Early</b> <b>action</b> RPGs tended to follow the template set by 1980s Nihon Falcom titles such as the Dragon Slayer and Ys series, which feature hack and slash combat where the player character's movements and actions are controlled directly, using a keyboard or game controller, rather than using menus. This formula was refined by the action-adventure game, The Legend of Zelda (1986), which set the template used by many subsequent action RPGs, including innovations such as an open world, nonlinear gameplay, battery backup saving, and an attack button that animates a sword swing or projectile attack on the screen. The game was {{largely responsible for the}} surge of action-oriented RPGs released since the late 1980s, both in Japan and North America. The Legend of Zelda series would continue to exert an influence on the transition of both console and computer RPGs from stat-heavy, turn-based combat towards real-time action combat in the following decades.|$|E

500|$|The {{defenses}} on {{the right}} side of the British camp were anchored by two redoubts. [...] The outermost one was defended by about 300 men under the command of the Hessian Heinrich von Breymann, while the other was under the command of Lord Balcarres. [...] A small contingent of Canadians occupied the ground between these two fortifications. [...] Most of the retreating force headed for Balcarres' position, as Breymann's was slightly north and further away from the <b>early</b> <b>action.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1967, after {{a change}} of government, the Secretary of State for Wales Cledwyn Hughes {{published}} a white paper which revived the idea of amalgamation, but instead of the boundary changes proposed in the previous report, treated each county as a whole. The report recommended a single new county of Gwynedd incorporating Denbighshire, Flintshire, Caernarfonshire, Merionethshire and Anglesey. The white paper stated that [...] "the need for <b>early</b> <b>action</b> is particularly urgent in Wales", and so the issue was not referred to a Royal Commission as in England. Opponents criticised the proposed new county for being too large, and in November 1968 a new Secretary of State announced that Gwynedd would be divided into two.|$|E
500|$|Venerable {{took the}} worst of the <b>early</b> <b>action</b> and at 05:30 the mizzen topmast was shot away. Hood responded by {{ordering}} Captain Aiskew Hollis in Thames to approach Troude's stern, the frigate repeatedly raking the French ship under fire from the ineffective stern guns. For another hour the ships traded broadsides, until at 06:45 the mainmast of Venerable collapsed over the side, significantly retarding the ship's movement. Formidable was able to pull ahead slowly in the light and unreliable winds, continuing to fire the stern guns at the now immobile British ship. Venerable was now drifting out of control, the foremast collapsing at 07:50 as the ship grounded on the shoals at Sancti Petri, [...] south of Cadiz. With his main opponent disabled, Troude continued slowly towards Cadiz, out of range of the approaching Caesar.|$|E

500|$|The 68th {{began the}} second day in a more {{defensible}} position on Cemetery Hill. [...] This placed them {{at the center of}} the Union line, and most of the day's <b>early</b> <b>action</b> was on the flanks. [...] In the evening, however, Early's forces attacked again; the charging Confederates quickly reached the top of the hill and some hand-to-hand combat broke out, but losses were light because the growing darkness made it difficult for soldiers on both sides to shoot accurately. [...] Reinforcements from the II Corps arrived and helped the XI Corps hold the position. [...] On the third day, the 68th remained in that position, but the major attack of the day, Pickett's Charge, was to their left. [...] The 68th performed better than they had at Chancellorsville, participating in their first Union victory. [...] They paid the price with much higher casualties, 8 killed and 63 wounded; 67 were made prisoners of war, many on the first day during the retreat to Cemetery Hill. [...] In the thick of the action for two out of three days, the 68th lost more men at Gettysburg than in any other battle.|$|E
2500|$|Generally <b>early</b> <b>action</b> {{is similar}} to early {{decision}} except the decision is not binding, so a student could apply to multiple colleges. The time frame is similar: apply by early November, get a decision by mid-December, although specific deadlines vary by school. It allows a student to compare competing offers. The exception {{is that there are}} four colleges – Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and Yale—which have a single-choice <b>early</b> <b>action</b> program, meaning that an applicant can only apply <b>early</b> <b>action</b> to one school. <b>Early</b> <b>action</b> can be the best choice for students who know they prefer one particular school and have done everything possible to secure admission since a student will know the result of the application sooner, and to varying extents allows a student to compare aid offers from different schools. One report suggested that non-binding <b>early</b> <b>action</b> programs continued to be highly popular, and noticed that three schools––Harvard, Princeton, and the University of Virginia—which had abandoned early admissions programs in 2006, reestablished them in 2011 after other colleges failed to follow their lead. Generally fewer schools offer the <b>early</b> <b>action</b> program but ones that do include Georgetown University, MIT, and Boston College.
