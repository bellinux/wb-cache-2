50|$|Breakage-fusion-bridge creates several identiﬁable {{cytogenetic}} abnormalities, such as anaphase {{bridges and}} dicentric chromosomes, {{which can be}} seen in progress using methods that have been available for decades. More recent methods, such as microarray hybridization and sequencing technologies, allow to infer evidence of BFB after the process has ceased. Two main types of such evidence are <b>fold-back</b> inversions and segment copy number patterns. <b>Fold-back</b> inversions are chimeric sequences that span head-to-head arrangements of inverted tandem-duplicated segments, and are expected to appear in BFB modified genomes. In addition, BFB induces amplification of segments of the original genome, where the number of repeats of each segment in the rearranged genome can be experimentally measured. Whilst the number of possible copy number patterns (each pattern a segmentation of the original genome and corresponding segment counts) is large, testing whether a given copy number pattern was produced by BFB can be efficiently decided computationally. While other genome instability mechanisms may also induce <b>fold-back</b> inversions and relatively short BFB-like copy number patterns, it is unlikely that such mechanisms will induce sufficiently long copy number patterns coupled with significant presence of <b>fold-back</b> inversions, and therefore when such evidence are observed they are considered to be indicative of BFB.|$|E
40|$|Abstract MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a {{class of}} {{endogenous}} small RNAs that play important regulatory roles in both animals and plants. miRNA genes have been intensively studied in animals, but not in plants. In this study, we adopted a homology search approach to identify homologs of previously validated plant miRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. We identified 20 potential miRNA genes in Arabidopsis and 40 in O. sativa, providing a relatively complete enumeration of family members for these miRNAs in plants. In addition, {{a greater number of}} Arabidopsis miRNAs (MIR 168, MIR 159 and MIR 172) were found to be conserved in rice. With the novel homologs, most of the miRNAs have closely related fellow miRNAs and the number of paralogs varies in the different miRNA families. Moreover, a probable functional segment highly conserved on the elongated stem of pre-miRNA <b>fold-backs</b> of MIR 319 and MIR 159 family was identified. These results support a model of variegated miRNA regulation in plants, in which miRNAs with different functional elements on their pre-miRNA <b>fold-backs</b> can differ in their function or regulation, and closely related miRNAs can be diverse in their specificity or competence to downregulate target genes. It appears that the sophisticated regulation of miRNAs can achieve complex biological effects through qualita-tive and quantitative modulation of gene expression profiles in plants.

40|$|High by-pass {{turbofan}} engines {{have fewer}} fan blades and lower rotation speeds than their predecessors. Consequently, the noise suppression {{at the low}} frequency end of the noise spectra has become an increasing concern. This {{has led to a}} renewed emphasis on improving noise suppression efficiency of passive, duct liner treatments at the lower frequencies. For a variety of reasons, passive liners are comprised of locally-reacting, resonant absorbers. One reason for this design choice is to satisfy operational and economic requirements. The simplest liner design consists of a single layer of honeycomb core sandwiched between a porous facesheet and an impervious backing plate. These resonant absorbing structures are integrated into the nacelle wall and are very ef- ficient over a limited bandwidth centered on their resonance frequency. Increased noise suppression bandwidth and greater suppression at lower frequencies is typically achieved for conventional liners by increasing the liner depth and incorporating thin porous septa into the honeycomb core. However, constraints on liner depth in modern high by-pass engine nacelles severely limit the suppression bandwidth extension to lower frequencies. Also, current honeycomb core liners may not be suitable for irregular geometric volumes heretofore not considered. It is of interest, therefore, to find ways to circumvent liner depth restrictions and resonator cavity shape constraints. One way to increase effective liner depth is to skew the honeycomb core axis relative to the porous facesheet surface. Other possibilities are to alter resonator cavity shape, e. g. high aspect ratio, narrow channels that possibly include right angle bends, 180. channel <b>fold-backs,</b> and splayed channel walls to conform to irregular geometric constraints. These possibilities constitute the practical motivation for expanding impedance modeling capability to include unconventional resonator orientations and shapes. The work reported in this paper is in the nature of a progress report and is limited to examining the implications of resonator axis skew on the composite normal incidence impedance of an array of resonator channels. Specifically, experimental results are compared with a modified impedance prediction model for highaspect- ratio, rectangular, resonator channels with varying amounts of skew relative to the incident particle velocity. It is shown that for resonator channel widths of 1 to 2 mm, aspect ratios of 25 to 50, and skew angles of zero to sixty degrees, the surface impedance of test models can be predicted with good accuracy. Predicted resistances and reactances are particularly well correlated through the first resonance and first anti-resonance for all six test models investigated. Beyond the first anti-resonance, the impedance prediction model loses the ability to predict details of resistance and reactance but still predicts the mean trends very well...|$|R
40|$|Double strand breaks (DSBs) occur {{frequently}} in DNA from various exogenous and endogenous sources. DSBs are {{a serious threat}} to the integrity of genome and to the survival of the cells. Therefore repairing DSBs is important. However, some DSBs repair pathways can lead to deleterious consequences, including genetic instability. One such dangerous pathway is break induced replication (BIR), which repairs broken chromosomes containing only one repairable end, similar to those generated by eroded telomeres, or during collapse of a replication fork, reviewed in (McEachern and Haber, 2006, Llorente et al., 2008). BIR is initiated by invasion of the broken chromosome into a homologous template, followed by copying of hundreds of kilo-bases of DNA from the donor. The DNA synthesis during BIR leads to various genetic instabilities including frequent mutations (Deem et al., 2011), loss of heterozygosity (Bosco and Haber, 1998, Malkova et al., 2005), telomere maintenance in the absence of telomerase (Lydeard et al., 2007), and copy number variation (Lee et al., 2007, Payen et al., 2008, Hastings et al., 2009), all hallmarks of human cancer. ^ Although, BIR is an important DSB repair pathway, {{little is known about the}} DNA synthesis during BIR. The first goal of the research presented in this thesis was to determine the mode of DNA synthesis associated with BIR and to characterize its molecular intermediates. We discovered that the DNA synthesis during BIR is significantly different from S-phase replication. We demonstrated that BIR is carried out by a migrating bubble instead of a bona-fide replication fork, leading to conservative inheritance of newly synthesized DNA. Importantly, single strand DNA accumulates behind the BIR bubble as a result of asynchrony between leading and lagging strand synthesis. The molecular mechanism of BIR that we discovered allowed us to explain all genetic instabilities resulting from BIR, including mutagenesis and various chromosomal rearrangements. Based on the importance of BIR for cancer initiation (Mai et al., 1996, Felsher and Bishop, 1999, Nagaraju et al., 2006, Stephens et al., 2011), we expect that our results will contribute towards the understanding of tumorigenesis. ^ The other important goal of this research was to determine how DSB repair can be channeled into BIR and other deleterious pathways. We demonstrated that inverted DNA repeats (IRs), located in the vicinity of DSB site can re-route DSB repair from conservative GC pathway, into BIR and chromosome loss. This re-routing occurs because IRs channel DSB repair into inter- molecular single strand annealing (SSA), leading to the formation of inverted dicentric (ID) chromosomes, or intra- molecular SSA, leading to formation of <b>fold-backs</b> (FB). Processing of these secondary structures leads to additional chromosome breakage, which leads to BIR and chromosome loss. We identified the proteins participating in the formation and processing of these secondary structures and characterized the parameters affecting their formation. Since IRs are abundant in human genome, our findings will be important for understanding genetic instabilities promoted by IRs in human diseases. ...|$|R

40|$|Two {{pathways}} {{have been}} proposed for eukaryotic Okazaki fragment RNA primer removal. Results presented here provide evidence for an alternative pathway. Primer extension by DNA polymerase δ (pol δ) displaces the downstream fragment into an RNA-initiated flap. Most flaps are cleaved by flap endonuclease 1 (FEN 1) while short, and the remaining nicks joined in the first pathway. A small fraction escapes immediate FEN 1 cleavage and is further lengthened by Pif 1 helicase. Long flaps are bound by replication protein A (RPA), which inhibits FEN 1. In the second pathway, Dna 2 nuclease cleaves an RPA-bound flap and displaces RPA, leaving a short flap for FEN 1. Pif 1 flap lengthening creates a requirement for Dna 2. This relationship should not have evolved unless Pif 1 had {{an important role in}} fragment processing. In this study, biochemical reconstitution experiments were used to gain insight into this role. Pif 1 did not promote synthesis through GC-rich sequences, which impede strand displacement. Pif 1 was also unable to open <b>fold-back</b> flaps that are immune to cleavage by either FEN 1 or Dna 2 and cannot be bound by RPA. However, Pif 1 working with pol δ readily unwound a full-length Okazaki fragment initiated by a <b>fold-back</b> flap.

40|$|Breakage-Fusion-Bridge (BFB) is a {{mechanism}} of genomic instability {{characterized by the}} joining and subsequent tearing apart of sister chromatids. When this process is repeated during multiple rounds of cell division, it leads to patterns of copy number increases of chromosomal segments as well as <b>fold-back</b> inversions where duplicated segments are arranged head-to-head. These structural variations can then drive tumorigenesis. BFB {{can be observed in}} progress using cytogenetic techniques, but generally BFB must be inferred from data like microarrays or sequencing collected after BFB has ceased. Making correct inferences from this data is not straightforward, particularly given the complexity of some cancer genomes and BFB's ability to generate a wide range of rearrangement patterns. Here we present algorithms to aid the interpretation of evidence for BFB. We first pose the BFB count vector problem: given a chromosome segmentation and segment copy numbers, decide whether BFB can yield a chromosome with the given segment counts. We present the first linear-time algorithm for the problem, improving a previous exponential-time algorithm. We then combine this algorithm with <b>fold-back</b> inversions to develop tests for BFB. We show that, contingent on assumptions about cancer genome evolution, count vectors and <b>fold-back</b> inversions are sufficient evidence for detecting BFB.

The TR- 1 repeat shares two short segments of homology with the 180 -bp repeat. The longest of these segments (31 bp; 64 % identity) corresponds to the conserved region among 180 -bp repeats. The polymorphism and complex structure of knob DNA suggest that, similar to the <b>fold-back</b> DNA-containing giant transposons in Drosophila, maize knob DNA may have some properties of transposable elements...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{single-crystal}} structures determined by Barabas and colleagues provides a detailed mechanism {{for how the}} TnpA transposase from Helicobacter pylori recognizes, cleaves, and integrates the IS 200 /IS 605 class of transposable elements. An interesting aspect of the mechanism is that the transposase recognizes the transposon through the unique <b>fold-back</b> structure adopted by the sequences of the DNA components, rather than through direct protein-DNA interactions. This {{is an example of}} indirect readout that is reminiscent of how four-stranded junctions are recognized by recombination proteins, but is also analogous to ribonucleoproteins, in that the DNA facilitates formation of an active nucleic acid-protein complex...|$|E
