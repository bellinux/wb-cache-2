5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme inhibitor is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic <b>guanosine</b> monophosphate. This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{reported}} that phosphoramidites activated with 1H-tetrazole react, to a small extent, with the O6 position of <b>guanosine.</b> Upon oxidation with I2 /water, this side product, possibly via O6-N7 migration, undergoes depurination. The apurinic sites thus formed are readily cleaved {{in the course of}} the final deprotection of the oligonucleotide under the basic conditions (see below) to give two shorter oligonucleotides thus reducing the yield of the full-length product. The O6 modifications are rapidly removed by treatment with the capping reagent as long as the capping step is performed prior to oxidation with I2/water.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{nucleic base}} of <b>guanosine</b> and 2'-deoxyguanosine {{does have an}} exocyclic amino group, its {{basicity}} is low to an extent {{that it does not}} react with phosphoramidites under the conditions of the coupling reaction. However, a phosphoramidite derived from the N2-unprotected 5'-O-DMT-2'-deoxyguanosine is poorly soluble in acetonitrile, the solvent commonly used in oligonucleotide synthesis. In contrast, the N2-protected versions of the same compound dissolve in acetonitrile well and hence are widely used. Nucleic bases adenine and cytosine bear the exocyclic amino groups reactive with the activated phosphoramidites under the conditions of the coupling reaction. By the use of additional steps in the synthetic cycle or alternative coupling agents and solvent systems, the oligonucleotide chain assembly may be carried out using dA and dC phosphoramidites with unprotected amino groups. However, these approaches currently remain in the research stage. In routine oligonucleotide synthesis, exocyclic amino groups in nucleosides are kept permanently protected over {{the entire length of the}} oligonucleotide chain assembly.|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{self-assembly}} {{takes advantage}} of supramolecular non-covalent interactions (ionic, hydrophobic, van der Waals, hydrogen and coordination bonds) {{for the construction of}} organized and tunable systems. In this field, lipophilic <b>guanosines</b> can represent powerful building blocks thanks to their aggregation proprieties in organic solvents, which can be controlled by addition or removal of cations. For example, potassium ion can template the formation of piled G-quartets structures, while in its absence ribbon-like G aggregates are generated in solution. In this thesis we explored the possibility of using <b>guanosines</b> as scaffolds to direct the construction of ordered and self-assembled architectures, one of the main goals of bottom-up approach in nanotechnology. In Chapter III we will describe Langmuir-Blodgett films obtained from <b>guanosines</b> and other lipophilic nucleosides, revealing the “special” behavior of guanine in comparison with the other nucleobases. In Chapter IV we will report the synthesis of several thiophene-functionalized <b>guanosines</b> and the studies towards their possible use in organic electronics: the pre-programmed organization of terthiophene residues in ribbon aggregates could allow charge conduction through π-π stacked oligothiophene functionalities. The construction and the behavior of some simple electronic nanodevices based on these organized thiopehene-guanosine hybrids has been explored. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Guanosines</b> with substituents at the 8 -position {{can provide}} useful {{fluorescent}} probes that effectively mimic guanine residues even in highly demanding model {{systems such as}} polymorphic G-quadruplexes and duplex DNA. Here, we report the synthesis and photophysical properties of a small family of 8 -substituted- 2 ′-deoxyguanosines that have been incorporated into the human telomeric repeat sequence using phosphoramidite chemistry. These include 8 -(2 -pyridyl) - 2 ′-deoxyguanosine (2 PyG), 8 -(2 -phenylethenyl) - 2 ′-deoxyguanosine (StG) and 8 -[2 -(pyrid- 4 -yl) -ethenyl]- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine (4 PVG). On DNA folding and stability, 8 -substituted <b>guanosines</b> can exhibit context-dependent effects but were better tolerated by G-quadruplex and duplex structures than pyrimidine mismatches. In contrast to previously reported fluorescent guanine analogs, 8 -substituted <b>guanosines</b> exhibit similar or even higher quantum yields upon their incorporation into nucleic acids (Φ[*]=[*] 0. 02 - 0. 45). We have used these highly emissive probes to quantify energy transfer efficiencies from unmodified DNA nucleobases to 8 -substituted <b>guanosines.</b> The resulting DNA-to-probe energy transfer efficiencies (ηt) are highly structure selective, with ηt(duplex) [*]<[*]ηt(single-strand) < ηt(G-quadruplex). These trends were independent of the exact structural features and thermal stabilities of the G-quadruplexes or duplexes containing them. The combination of efficient energy transfer, high probe quantum yield, and high molar extinction coefficient of the DNA provides a highly sensitive and reliable readout of G-quadruplex formation even in highly diluted sample solutions of 0. 25 [*]n...|$|R
40|$|Kethoxal {{modification}} of <b>guanosines</b> within Phe-tRNAPhe from E. coli was studied for tRNA {{in the free}} state and specifically bound to the ribosomal A-site. Complex formation with the ribosome results in a protection from chemical {{modification of}} two distant sites in the tRNA molecule. The <b>guanosines</b> affected are G- 18 and G- 19, located in the D-loop, and G- 34 in the anticodon loop. Modification of Phe-tRNAPhe in the absence of ribosomes leads to a destabilisation of the tRNA structure. Our data are consistent with the conclusion that modification of G- 34 at the anticodon loop triggers a conformational instability in distant parts of the tRNA molecule...|$|R
5|$|DNA can {{be damaged}} by many sorts of mutagens, which change the DNA sequence. Mutagens include {{oxidizing}} agents, alkylating agents and also high-energy electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light and X-rays. The type of DNA damage produced {{depends on the}} type of mutagen. For example, UV light can damage DNA by producing thymine dimers, which are cross-links between pyrimidine bases. On the other hand, oxidants such as free radicals or hydrogen peroxide produce multiple forms of damage, including base modifications, particularly of <b>guanosine,</b> and double-strand breaks. A typical human cell contains about 150,000 bases that have suffered oxidative damage. Of these oxidative lesions, the most dangerous are double-strand breaks, as these are difficult to repair and can produce point mutations, insertions, deletions from the DNA sequence, and chromosomal translocations. These mutations can cause cancer. Because of inherent limits in the DNA repair mechanisms, if humans lived long enough, they would all eventually develop cancer. DNA damages that are naturally occurring, due to normal cellular processes that produce reactive oxygen species, the hydrolytic activities of cellular water, etc., also occur frequently. Although most of these damages are repaired, in any cell some DNA damage may remain despite the action of repair processes. These remaining DNA damages accumulate with age in mammalian postmitotic tissues. This accumulation appears to be an important underlying cause of aging.|$|E
25|$|The NO {{produced}} by {{this process is}} a potent activator of guanylyl cyclase (GC) by heme-dependent mechanisms; this activation results in formation of cyclic <b>guanosine</b> monophosphate (cGMP) from <b>guanosine</b> triphosphate (GTP). Among other roles, cGMP serves as a substrate for a cGMP-dependent protein kinase that activates myosin light chain phosphatase. Thus, production of NO from exogenous sources such as GTN increases the level of cGMP within the cell, and stimultates dephosphorylation of myosin.|$|E

30|$|During {{the reverse}} {{transcription}} of HIV viral RNAs, only single-stranded DNA is generated. However, {{based on previous}} knowledge on cGAS, only double-stranded DNA can associate with and activate cGAS (Wu and Chen, 2014). Then how HIV-derived DNA is recognized by cGAS? Actually, HIV-derived single-stranded DNA forms short base-paired DNA stretches that are strong activators of cGAS (Herzner et al., 2015). These short dsDNAs (also called Y-form DNA) formed from single-stranded DNAs are the predominant viral DNAs in the cytosol during the early infection of host cells. Y-form DNAs are characterized by unpaired <b>guanosines</b> flanking the stem region. They are flexible in respect of the numbers of unpaired <b>guanosines</b> and represent a newly discovered robust PAMP.|$|R

These participate in hydrogen-bonding arrangements with adjacent decamer duplexes in the crystal lattice. The unpaired <b>guanosines</b> are bound in the G+C regions of duplex minor grooves. The cytosines have relatively high mobility, even though they are constrained to be in one region where they are involved in base-paired triplets with G. C base pairs.

The binding properties of this 64 -kilodalton (kDa) protein were characterized by competition assays and by methylation interference assays. DNA fragments with single base-pair changes at positions 7 and 8 of CDEI were less efficient competitors than fragments with nonmutated CDEI. Mutations at these positions have previously been shown to decrease centromere activity in vivo. Methylation of <b>guanosines</b> at {{either side of the}} 8 -base-pair CDEI sequence did not interfere with binding, whereas methylation of any of the four <b>guanosines</b> within CDEI prevented binding.

40|$|The {{fidelity}} {{of protein}} biosynthesis rests {{largely on the}} correct aminoacylation of transfer RNAs by their cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} the interaction of Escherichia coli tRNA(Gln) with glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (GlnRS) provides an excellent system for studying the basis of this highly specific recognition process. Correct aminoacylation depends on the set of nucleotides (identity elements) in tRNA(Gln) responsible for correct interaction with GlnRS. Specific contacts between tRNA(Gln) and GlnRS include the 2 -amino group of <b>guanosines.</b> Therefore, we made a set of tRNA(Gln) variants in which specific <b>guanosines</b> were replaced by inosine using recombinant RNA technology. This resulted in a set of tRNAs that varied by single deletions of the amino group from guanine residues, thus allowing us to test the functional importance of these contacts. In addition, a number of mutants were made by transcription of mutated tRNA genes with base changes at position 10, 16 or 25. In vitro aminoacylation of these mutants showed decreases in the specificity constant (kcat/KM) of up to 300 -fold, with kcat being the parameter most affected. These experiments reveal G 10 as a new element of glutamine identity. In addition, the interaction of G 2, G 3 and G 10 with GlnRS via the 2 -amino group is significant for tRNA discrimination. Based on these results, and on earlier data, we propose a complete set of bases as identity elements for tRNA(Gln) ...|$|R
25|$|However, {{the link}} between {{dopamine}} and purine synthesis is a nucleotide called <b>guanosine</b> triphosphate or 'GTP'.

40|$|We have {{identified}} by nucleotide analog interference mapping (NAIM) exocyclic NH 2 groups of <b>guanosines</b> in RNase P RNA from Escherichia coli {{that are important}} for tRNA binding. The majority of affected <b>guanosines</b> represent phylogenetically conserved nucleotides. Several sites of interference could be assigned to direct contacts with the tRNA moiety, whereas others were interpreted as reflecting indirect effects on tRNA binding due to the disruption of tertiary contacts within the catalytic RNA. Our results support {{the involvement of the}} 2 -NH 2 groups of G 292 /G 293 in pairing with C 74 and C 75 of tRNA CCA-termini, as well as formation of two consecutive base triples involving C 75 and A 76 of CCA-ends interacting with G 292 /A 258 and G 291 /G 259, respectively. Moreover, we present first biochemical evidence for two tertiary contacts (L 18 /P 8 and L 8 /P 4) within the catalytic RNA, whose formation has been postulated previously on the basis of phylogenetic comparative analyses. The tRNA binding interference data obtained in this and our previous studies are consistent with the formation of a consecutive nucleotide triple and quadruple between the tetraloop L 18 and helix P 8. Formation of the nucleotide triple (G 316 and A 94 :U 104 in wild-type E. coli RNase P RNA) is also supported by mutational analysis.

25|$|A {{catabolic pathway}} {{is a series}} of {{reactions}} that bring about a net release of energy {{in the form of a}} high energy phosphate bond formed with the energy carriers Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) and <b>Guanosine</b> Diphosphate (GDP) to produce Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and <b>Guanosine</b> Triphosphate (GTP), respectively.

A catabolic pathway is an exergonic system that produces chemical energy in the form of ATP, GTP, NADH, NADPH, FADH2, etc. from energy containing sources such as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. The end products are often carbon dioxide, water, and ammonia. Coupled with an endergonic reaction of anabolism, the cell can synthesize new macromolecules using the original precursors of the anabolic pathway. An example of a coupled reaction is the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate to form the intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate by the enzyme phsophofructokinase accompanied by the hydrolysis of ATP in the pathway of glycolysis. The resulting chemical reaction within the metabolic pathway is highly thermodynamically favorable and, as a result, irreversible in the cell.|$|E
