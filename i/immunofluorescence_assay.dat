5|$|HIV-1 {{testing is}} {{initially}} by an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) to detect antibodies to HIV-1. Specimens with a nonreactive result from the initial ELISA are considered HIV-negative unless new exposure to an infected partner or partner of unknown HIV status has occurred. Specimens with a reactive ELISA result are retested in duplicate. If the result of either duplicate test is reactive, the specimen is reported as repeatedly reactive and undergoes confirmatory testing with a more specific supplemental test (e.g., western blot or, less commonly, an <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>assay</b> (IFA)). Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or reactive by western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection. Specimens that are repeatedly ELISA-reactive occasionally provide an indeterminate western blot result, which may be either an incomplete antibody response to HIV in an infected person or nonspecific reactions in an uninfected person.|$|E

However, the lesions are limited, and aren't indicative solely of SeV infection. Detection, therefore, makes use of SeV-specific antigens in several serological methods, including ELISA, immunofluorescence, and hemagglutination assays, with particular emphasis on use of the ELISA for its high sensitivity (unlike the hemagglutination assay) and its fairly early detection (unlike the <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>assay).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} can {{be confirmed}} by the characteristic appearance of the chest x-ray, which shows widespread pulmonary infiltrates, and an arterial oxygen level (PaO2) that is strikingly lower than would be expected from symptoms. Gallium 67 scans are also useful in the diagnosis. They are abnormal in approximately 90% of cases and are often positive before the chest x-ray becomes abnormal. The diagnosis can be definitively confirmed by histological identification of the causative organism in sputum or bronchio-alveolar lavage (lung rinse). Staining with toluidine blue, silver stain, periodic-acid schiff stain, or an <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>assay</b> will show the characteristic cysts. The cysts resemble crushed ping-pong balls and are present in aggregates of 2 to 8 (and {{not to be confused}} with Histoplasma or Cryptococcus, which typically do not form aggregates of spores or cells). A lung biopsy would show thickened alveolar septa with fluffy eosinophilic exudate in the alveoli. Both the thickened septa and the fluffy exudate contribute to dysfunctional diffusion capacity which is characteristic of this pneumonia.|$|E

40|$|Uptake of {{transferrin}} by epimastigote {{forms of}} the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi occurs mainly through a cytostome/ cytopharynx, via uncoated endocytic vesicles that bud off {{from the bottom of}} the cytopharynx. We have here examined whether detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) domains might be involved in this process. Purified whole cell membrane fractions were assayed for cholesterol levels and used in dot blot analyses. Detergent-resistant membrane markers (cholera B toxin and anti-flotillin- 1 antibody) presented positive reaction by dot blots in cholesterol-rich/ protein-poor membrane sub-fractions. The positive dot blot fraction was submitted to lipid composition analysis, showing composition similar to that of raft fractions described for other eukaryotic cells. <b>Immunofluorescence</b> <b>assays</b> allowed the localization of punctual positive signal for flotillin- 1, matching the precise cytostome/ cytopharynx location.

As {{the structure of the}} presumptive human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA poly-merase processivity factor UL 44 is highly homologous to that of PCNA, we hypothesized that UL 44 also interacts with numerous proteins. To investigate this possibility, recombinant HCMV expressing FLAG-tagged UL 44 was generated and used to immunoprecipitate UL 44 and associated proteins from infected cell lysates. Unexpectedly, nucleolin, a major protein component of the nucleolus, was identified among these proteins by mass spectrometry and Western blotting. The association of nucleolin and UL 44 in infected cell lysate was confirmed by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation in the presence and absence of nuclease. Western blotting and <b>immunofluorescence</b> <b>assays</b> demonstrated that the level of nucleolin increases during infection and that nucleolin becomes distributed throughout the nucleus.
