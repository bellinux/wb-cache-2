40|$|Although recent {{globalization}} {{allows us}} traveling abroad easier ever, {{the number of}} foreign passengers is still scarce. Government of Japan worries about this problem and makes some policy to attract foreign travelers. In this paper, we investigate the barrier against <b>international</b> air <b>passenger</b> <b>transportation</b> services in Japan by quantifying the “border effect. ” In order to measure this effect, we estimate the gravity equation with “border ” dummy variable for explaining intra- and <b>international</b> <b>passenger</b> flow in Japan. “Border ” dummy is introduced to quantify the impeding effect for crossing national border. If the dummy variable has negative coefficient, <b>international</b> <b>passenger</b> flow in Japan is smaller than intranational passenger flow. The result demonstrates that a certain “border effect ” exists in international air travel. This result implies that <b>international</b> air <b>passenger</b> flow is diminished seriously by some impediments such as political regulation, institutional inefficiency, and so on.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} <b>international</b> <b>passenger</b> air <b>transportation</b> services in Japan by quantifying the "border effect. " In order to measure the border effect, we employ the basic gravity model for explaining intra- and <b>international</b> <b>passenger</b> flow in Japan as a benchmark model at first. And then, "border effect" dummy variable is introduced to quantify the diminishing effect to passenger flow in case of international travel. If the dummy variable has negative and statistically significant coefficient, <b>international</b> <b>passenger</b> flow in Japan is smaller than intranational flow. Bilateral passenger flow data among main Japanese airports and between Japanese airport and foreign one is used for our empirical estimation, and the dummy variable shows negative coefficient. This result implies that <b>international</b> <b>passenger</b> flow is diminished by some impediments such as political regulation, institutional inefficiency, and so on. For instance, entry barrier for new carrier or market access restriction to airport services in international airline may have decreasing effect to <b>international</b> <b>passenger</b> flow because of high services cost, and poorly established infrastructure like international air terminal or tiresome immigrant / emigrant procedure may decline passengers' incentives for traveling abroad or visiting Japan. Unfortunately we cannot specify the reason why <b>international</b> <b>passenger</b> flow is so small because we just measure the difference between international and intranational flow. However, if there are really some impediments in international air transportation services, those may be disadvantageous for Japanese airports to compete with other Asian international hub airports...|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{international}} trade and maritime operation have played an increasingly significant role in providing <b>international</b> cargo and <b>passenger</b> <b>transportation.</b> Consequently, seaports over the world are suffering from the problem of fuel consumption and exhaust gases coming from ships during their stopover in harbors. Ships at berth generate electricity by means of their auxiliary engines, and emit air pollutants and noise. As a result, ports become an important and growing source of pollution and can create significant risks for the health of nearby communities. Costs involved in the shore-side power program can vary widely among ports. In this paper economic and environmental analysis related to ships and shore-side power have been studied Additionally, the practicability, costs and benefits of switching from onboard ship auxiliary engines to shore-side power connection for a ro/ro ship while berthed at Civitavecchia port have been investigated...|$|R

In Italy, the emissions of the industrial and energy sectors have been reduced (almost 50 % between 1998 and 2012), but the sulfur oxide (SOx) from the maritime sector has almost doubled. The national and international maritime traffic is responsible for 80 % of total emissions attributable to transportation. In this paper firstly we propose a method to compare the costs of various shore-side power sources connections with those obtained by use of auxiliary engines on board; two numerical examples have been developed. The results, in terms of costs and reduction of exhaust, have been particularly discussed...|$|R

Railway infrastructure is not only an important system-building element of economic and settlement patterns; it also affects cultural landscapes. The study of cartographic materials and historiography made it possible to identify the main stages of the development of the Kaliningrad railway network in terms of its territorial scope and to describe causes of the observed changes. Historically, changes in the political, economic, and military environment were key factors behind the development of the Kaliningrad railway network. Nature was less important. The existing Kaliningrad railway network is to a great degree the legacy of the earlier, pre-war times. Today, its primary function is to provide <b>international</b> cargo and <b>passenger</b> <b>transportation.</b> Two types of railway infrastructure are identified in the Kaliningrad region – modern (functioning) and relic (abandoned) ones. In the Kaliningrad region, the process of land reclamation of the railway system starts when the maintenance of railroads is discontinued, which is followed by the formation of primitive soils and emerging biocenoses enhanced by fill soils and artificial relief. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The paper {{focuses on}} {{a study of the}} US railway {{transport}} organization management during <b>passenger</b> <b>transportation.</b> Methodology. Studies were carried out {{on the basis of the}} analysis of literature sources and reporting data on <b>passenger</b> <b>transportation</b> in the USA. Findings. Negative trends in the work of the passenger complex of the Ukrainian railways are the slowdown in the volumes of transportation, the progressive aging of the rolling stock and the overall activity running at a loss for Ukrzaliznytsia. In this regard, the actual task for domestic rail transport is the implementation of industry reforms. Therefore, the paper presented the study of the experience of organizing the <b>passenger</b> <b>transportation</b> on US railways, whose peculiarity is the extremely high degree of competition between modes of transport. As a result of the conducted analysis for working conditions of the US and Ukrainian railways, the general conditions for the functioning of the railways in both countries connected with <b>passenger</b> <b>transportation</b> securing have been established. It was found that general condition for execution of railway <b>passenger</b> <b>transportation</b> for the United States and Ukraine is the subsidization of this activity and combined use of infrastructure for the freight and passengers’ transportations. In this connection, when developing approaches to reforming the passenger economy of Ukraine's railways, it is advisable to use the experience of the United States in assessing the social effectiveness of rail transport, the impact of <b>passenger</b> <b>transportation</b> on the conditions of freight trains handling, and combined use of railway infrastructure by freight and passenger companies.

40|$|The {{increased}} industry consolidation {{resulting in}} the formation of new highly organized forms of cooperation is referred as one of the main features of air transport globalization at the present stage. Consolidation allows carriers to overcome the excessive competition and to strengthen their market position. It also helps them to optimize the route network and organizational structure of the company. This article includes the analysis of the dynam-ics of global air passenger traffic by low-cost carriers in the period 2003 – 2015. An aggressive struggle for passengers in-creases competition in a low-cost environment while contributing to the consolidation process. In 2015 low-cost airlines provided 27. 1 % of global passenger air traffic. In absolute terms, the volume of traffic increased by 5 times from 197 mil-lion passengers in 2003 to 1100 million passengers in 2015. Those figures have significantly surpassed the dynamics of global passenger air traffic (from 1. 7 billion passengers in 2003 to 3. 5 billion passengers in 2015). The highest share of low-cost carriers is noticed in Southeast Asia. In 2015 due to the high level of competition a decreased was observed for the first time 15 years prompting the creation of the first budget airline alliances. U-FLY and Value Alliances which were founded in the beginning of 2016 represent the mechanism for competition with leading Asian independent low-cost groups. The main objective of joining the alliance for the participants is to in-crease their brand awareness in the Asia-Pacific region and to expand the distribution network. The benefits of airlines economic integration within alliances and long-haul low-cost subsidiaries enhance the competitiveness of low-cost carries under conditions of high global aviation market volatility.
