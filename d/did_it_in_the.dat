5|$|Kershaw was {{selected}} to the National League team for the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, his first All-Star selection. In the month of July, Kershaw was 4–1 with a 2.02 ERA and NL-leading 45 strikeouts, earning him the National League Pitcher of the Month Award. On August 23, he struck out Matt Holliday of the St. Louis Cardinals for his 200th strikeout {{of the season and}} became the 10th Dodger pitcher to record back-to-back 200 strikeout seasons and the first since Chan-Ho Park <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2001 season.|$|E
5|$|Max Weber was {{a pioneer}} in {{delineating}} a connection between capitalism and exceptionalism. In earlier texts, Maximiliano Korstanje explores the American exceptionalism {{and its effects on}} the current means of productions. This contribution to the existent literature is of paramount importance because of two main reasons. The first and most important, he relates capitalism to Protestantism. This is of course nothing new, since Max Weber <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. However, Korstanje adds, though Weber was in the correct side by confirming the connection of Reform and Capitalism, the key role played by Norse Mythology was left behind. In effect, the concept of predestination as it has been discussed by Weber did not come from Luther alone. It was rather enrooted in the core of Norse Culture. Secondly, this impossibility to understand the future led to English speaking societies to construct a risk-prone culture, which resulted in what Ulrich Beck dubbed the “Risk Society”. The criticism exerted in the uneven distribution of Capitalism should be explained by the “economy of salved peoples” formulated by Weber.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, 2009, Kershaw pitched seven innings, {{striking}} out 13 batters while allowing only one hit (a solo home run) against the rival San Francisco Giants. He {{was the youngest}} Dodger to ever strikeout 13 or more batters in a game since Sandy Koufax <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1955 season. On May 17, 2009, Kershaw did not allow a hit against the Florida Marlins through 7 innings, then gave up a lead-off double to Florida's Cody Ross. In 2009, despite an 8–8 record, he led the major leagues in opposing batting average (.200), opposing slugging percentage (.282), and hits per nine innings (6.26). He also posted an ERA of 2.79 and 185 strikeouts. Kershaw also walked 91 batters, which was second most in the National League (NL).|$|E

5|$|Kemp {{started the}} 2012 season {{by winning the}} National League Player of the Week award for the opening weekend. He hit two home runs and drove in eight RBIs during the opening series against the San Diego Padres. He {{was also the first}} Dodger to record three {{consecutive}} multi-hit games to start the season since Adrián Beltré <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2000 season. This was the third time he had won the award, and second consecutive as he had won it the final week of 2011 as well. On April 10, Kemp became the first LA Dodger to have an RBI in the first five games of the season since J. D. Drew in the 2006 season and, counting the end of the previous season, he had nine straight games with an RBI, tying Roy Campanella (1955 season) and Augie Galan (1944 season) for the Dodgers franchise record. Kemp also won the Player of the Week award for the second week of the season, which, combined with winning the award in the last week of 2011, made him the only player to ever win three consecutive awards. He was also only the second player to win the award twice to begin the season, the other being Tony Armas for the 1981 Athletics. Kemp hit 12–22 with 4 HRs and a 1.182 slugging percentage, leading the club to its best 10-game start since 1981.|$|E

25|$|Swann was {{the leading}} {{receiver}} in the game with 7 receptions for 124 yards and a touchdown. Stallworth recorded 115 {{yards and two touchdowns}} off just 3 receptions. Stallworth and Swann became the first pair of teammates to each have 100 yards receiving in a Super Bowl and first time two receivers <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same game. Dorsett was the top rusher of the game with 96 rushing yards, and also caught 5 passes for 44 yards. Harris was Pittsburgh's leading rusher with 68 yards, and he caught a pass for 22 yards. Staubach finished the game with exactly as many passing attempts (30) and completions (17) as Bradshaw, good for 228 passing yards, 3 touchdowns, and 1 interception. Butch Johnson caught 2 passes for 30 yards and a touchdown, returned 3 kickoffs for 63 yards, and gained 33 yards on 2 punt returns, giving him 126 total yards.

25|$|Despite {{missing the}} playoffs in {{back-to-back}} seasons {{for the first time}} since the 1980s, the 2007–08 season displayed many signs of growth in the team, especially towards the end of the season. Off-court legal distraction from Jamaal Tinsley, Marquis Daniels, and Shawne Williams in the middle of the season did not help the Pacers struggles, and injuries to Tinsley and Jermaine O'Neal damaged the Pacers' already weak defense and left almost all point guard duties to recently acquired Travis Diener, who saw minimal minutes on his previous NBA teams. Despite this, and a 36–46 record, the Pacers had a very strong finish to the season, which included a desperate attempt to steal the 8th seed from the Atlanta Hawks, and dramatic improvement in forwards Danny Granger and Mike Dunleavy. Both Granger and Dunleavy were involved in the voting for Most Improved Player, with Dunleavy finishing in the top 10. The two were also the first Pacers players to score 1500 points each in a single season since Reggie Miller and Detlef Schrempf <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1990s.|$|E

500|$|Kershaw {{finished}} {{the season with}} a 16-9 record, 236 innings pitched (a career high), and a Major League best 1.83 ERA and 0.92 WHIP.

His ERA was the first sub-2.00 ERA since Roger Clemens <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2005 season and the lowest overall since Pedro Martínez in the 2000 season.

500|$|Biden's Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized {{again in}} 2013. The act led to further related {{developments}} {{in the creation of}} the White House Council on Women and Girls, begun in the first term, as well as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, begun in January 2014 with Biden as co-chair along with Jarrett. Biden has a strong stance on sexual assault. For example, Biden stated to a victim of sexual assault at Stanford University, [...] "you <b>did</b> <b>it...</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope that your strength might prevent this crime from happening to someone else.

500|$|As a manager, he was {{a strict}} disciplinarian, {{possibly}} {{a result of his}} military background. [...] Carroll [...] "Dink" [...] Mothell maintained that [...] "Rogan wanted to run the ball club like they <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> army. He liked to give orders too much, even before he was managing. He used to bawl players out for different things. I could take it, but we had ball players, when he'd get on them, they'd go into a shell, resented it, and didn't give him their best." [...] Another Monarchs pitcher, Chet Brewer, said that [...] "Rogan wasn't the best manager because he was such a great ball player himself. [...] He couldn't teach pitchers much, because he'd say, 'All {{you have to do is}} go out and throw the man what I threw'." [...] According to historian Phil Dixon, [...] "In Rogan's first few years as manager he was reluctant to pinch-hit for many of the veterans on his roster because they were his friends." [...] He didn't trust younger players, often inserting himself to pitch or pinch-hit for them. He sometimes treated rookies harshly. Eventually Rogan [...] "discarded his distant approach" [...] and became increasingly known for teaching and developing less experienced players.|$|E
2500|$|However, [...] "Althusser {{never ceased}} {{to put in}} {{question}} the images of communism that Marxist theory and ideology carried on: but he <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> name of communism itself." [...] Althusser thus criticized the evolutionist image which made of communism an ultimate stage of history, {{as well as the}} apocalyptic images which made it a [...] "society of transparence", [...] "without contradiction" [...] nor ideology. Balibar observes that, in the end, Althusser enjoined the most sober definition of communism, exposed by Marx in The German Ideology: Communism is [...] "not a state of the future, but the real movement which destroys the existing state of being.".|$|E
