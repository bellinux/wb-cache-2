40|$|American trypanosomiasis or Chagas {{disease is}} a {{debilitating}} disease representing an important social problem that affects, approximately, 10 {{million people in the}} world. The main aggravating factor of this situation is the lack of an effective drug to treat the different stages of this disease. In this context, the search for trypanocidal substances isolated from plants, synthetic or semi synthetic molecules, is an important strategy. Here, the trypanocidal potential of gallates was assayed in epimastigotes forms of T. cruzi and also, the interference of these substances on the mitochondrial membrane potential of the parasites was assessed, allowing the study of the mechanism of action of the gallates in the T. cruzi organisms. Regarding the preliminary structure-activity relationships, the side chain length of gallates plays crucial role for activity. Nonyl, decyl, undecyl, and <b>dodecyl</b> <b>gallates</b> showed potent antitrypanosomal effect (IC 50 from 1. 46 to 2. 90 [*]μM) in contrast with benznidazole (IC 50 = 34. 0 [*]μM). Heptyl gallate showed a strong synergistic activity with benznidazole, reducing by 105 -fold the IC 50 of benznidazole. Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential induced by these esters was revealed. Tetradecyl gallate induced a loss of 53 % of the mitochondrial membrane potential, at IC 50 value...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the mechanism of cytotoxicity of octyl (G 8) and <b>dodecyl</b> (G 12) <b>gallates</b> in a murine melanoma cell line (B 16 F 10). For this purpose, several methods to measure cell viability {{were used to determine}} if the cytotoxicity induced by these gallates corresponds to a general or an organelle-specific effect. Furthermore, the mechanisms related to apoptosis were examined, by studying the caspase- 3 activity, oxidative stress, mitochondrial potential and the expression of anti- or proapoptotic proteins. When comparing the various methods of assessing cell viability, the tested gallates showed a higher cytotoxicity in the assay that indicates lysosomal activity, compared with the assays that indicate mitochondrial and ribosomal activities. Both gallates promoted the release of lactate dehydrogenase into the medium, indicating an effect on cell membrane integrity. The gallates also promoted cellular oxidative stress, mitochondrial depolarization and an increase in caspase- 3 activity. Furthermore, the gallates induced an increase in proapoptotic (Bax) and a decrease in antiapoptotic (Bcl- 2) proteins expression. Our results indicate that the apoptotic cell death induced by G 8 and G 12 in B 16 F 10 cells involves lipid membrane damages, lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction, which was accompanied by alterations in apoptotic proteins expression and seems to be triggered by cellular oxidative stress...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{evolution}} of oxidation and the efficiency of phenolic antioxidants in sunflower oil-in-water emulsions containing sodium caseinate and lactose (Cas-Lac) or stabilized by Tween- 20 (T- 20). Two groups of phenolic antioxidants which are structurally similar were tested, i. e. (1) α-tocopherol and its water-soluble analogue, Trolox; and (2) gallic acid and its ester derivatives propyl gallate and <b>dodecyl</b> <b>gallate.</b> Emulsion samples were oxidized at 40 °C and the progress of oxidation was followed through quantitation of oxidized triacylglycerol monomers, dimers and oligomers. Results showed that Cas-Lac emulsions were more stable to oxidation than T- 20 emulsions. In both types of emulsions, the most protective antioxidants were the compounds of lower polarity, namely, α-tocopherol and <b>dodecyl</b> <b>gallate.</b> It was also found that substantial amounts of α-tocopherol coexisted with significant polymerization, which was indicative of the heterogeneity of oxidation, i. e. differences of oxidation rate in oil droplets.

We have previously obtained serveal Traditional Chinese Medicine monomers using a computer-based screening. In this study, either alone or in combination with penicillin, their antimicrobial activities were evaluated based on in vivo and in vitro assays. The results showed that the MICs of 5 '-(Methylthio) - 5 '-deoxyadenosine, octanal 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazone, deoxyshikonin, kavahin, and <b>dodecyl</b> <b>gallate</b> against S. pneumoniae were 37. 1, 38. 5, 17, 68. 5, and 21 µg/mL, respectively. Time-killing assays showed that these compounds elicited bactericidal effects against S. pneumoniae D 39 strain, which led to a 6 -log reduction in CFU after exposure to compounds at four times of the MIC for 24 h. The five compounds inhibited the growth of S. pyogenes, S. mitis, S. mutans or S. pseudopneumoniae, meanwhile, deoxyshikonin and <b>dodecyl</b> <b>gallate</b> displayed strong inhibitory activities against S. aureus. Survival time of the mice infected by S. pneumoniae strains was prolonged by the treatment with the compounds. Importanly, all of the five compounds exerted antimicrobial effects against multidrug-resistant clinical strains of S. pneumoniae. Moreover, even at sub-MIC concentration, they inhibited cell division and biofilm formation. The five compounds all have enhancement effect on penicillin. Deoxyshikonin and <b>dodecyl</b> <b>gallate</b> showed significantly synergic antimicrobial activity with penicillin in vivo and in vitro, and effectively reduced nasopharyngeal and lung colonization caused by different penicillin-resistant pneumococcal serotypes. In addition, the two compounds also showed synergic antimicrobial activity with erythromycin and tetracycline. Taken together, our results our results suggested that these novel VicK inhibitors may be promising compounds against gram-positive bacterial infection...|$|E

40|$|Radiation-crosslinked UHMWPE {{has been}} used for joint {{implants}} since the 1990 s. Postirradiation remelting enhances oxidative stability, but with some loss in strength and toughness. Vitamin E-stabilized crosslinked UHMWPE has shown improved strength and stability as compared with irradiated and remelted UHMWPE. With more active phenolic hydroxyl groups, natural polyphenols are widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industries as potent stabilizers and could be useful for oxidative stability in crosslinked UHMWPE. We asked whether UHMWPE blended with polyphenols would (1) show higher oxidation resistance after radiation crosslinking; (2) preserve the mechanical properties of UHMWPE after accelerated aging; and (3) alter the wear resistance of radiation-crosslinked UHMWPE. The polyphenols, gallic acid and <b>dodecyl</b> <b>gallate,</b> were blended with medical-grade UHMWPE followed by consolidation and electron beam irradiation at 100 kGy. Radiation-crosslinked virgin and vitamin E-blended UHMWPEs were used as reference materials. The UHMWPEs were aged at 120 A degrees C in air with oxidation levels analyzed by infrared spectroscopy. Tensile (n = 5 per group) and impact (n = 3 per group) properties before and after aging as per ASTM F 2003 were evaluated. The wear rates were examined by pin-on-disc testing (n = 3 per group). The data were reported as mean +/- A SDs. Statistical analysis was performed by using Student's t-test for a two-tailed distribution with unequal variance for tensile and impact data obtained with n a parts per thousand yen 3. A significant difference is defined with p < 0. 05. The oxidation induction time of 100 kGy UHMWPE was prolonged to 144 hours with 0. 05 wt% <b>dodecyl</b> <b>gallate</b> and 192 hours with 0. 05 wt% gallic acid compared with 48 hours for 0. 05 wt% vitamin E-blended UHMWPE. Accelerated aging of these polyphenol-blended UHMWPEs resulted in ultimate tensile strength of 50. 4 +/- A 1. 4 MPa and impact strength of 53 +/- A 5 kJ/m(2) for 100 kGy-irradiated UHMWPE with 0. 05 wt% <b>dodecyl</b> <b>gallate,</b> for example, in comparison to 51. 2 +/- A 0. 7 MPa (p = 0. 75) and 58 +/- A 5 kJ/m(2) (p = 0. 29) before aging. The pin-on-disc wear rates of 100 kGy-irradiated UHMWPE with 0. 05 wt% <b>dodecyl</b> <b>gallate</b> and 0. 05 wt% gallic acid were 2. 29 +/- A 0. 31 and 1. 65 +/- A 0. 32 mg/million cycles, comparable to 1. 68 +/- A 0. 25 and 2. 05 +/- A 0. 22 mg/million cycles for 100 kGy-irradiated virgin and 0. 05 wt% vitamin E-blended UHMWPE. Based on the sample numbers tested in this study, polyphenols appear to effectively enhance the oxidation stability without altering the mechanical properties or pin-on-disc wear rate of radiation-crosslinked UHMWPE. Crosslinked UHMWPE with natural polyphenols with improved oxidative stability and low wear may find clinical application in joint implants...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{evaluating}} the effectiveness of phenolic antioxidants with a similar structure but having a different polarity in dried microencapsulated sunflower oil. The antioxidants tested were, on one hand, α-tocopherol and its water soluble analogue, Trolox, and on the other, gallic acid and its ester derivatives, propyl gallate and <b>dodecyl</b> <b>gallate.</b> At a moderate temperature (40 °C), the samples were oxidized under accelerated conditions by using Cu(II) as an oxidation catalyst. The progress of oxidation was followed up over time in the free and encapsulated oil fractions. The peroxide value, the total content of polymers and, when appropriate, the content of α-tocopherol were determined. Quantitative analysis of the total fraction of the non-volatile oxidation products and their distribution in oligomers, dimers and monomers was applied to samples to obtain a complete evaluation of oxidation. Finally, as a complementary measure, the antioxidants were also assessed by direct application of the Rancimat test at 100 °C on the dried microencapsulated oil samples. Results showed that the antioxidants of lower polarity in each series, i. e. tocopherol and <b>dodecyl</b> <b>gallate,</b> were {{to a great extent}} the most protective antioxidants. The results obtained by the Rancimat test were consistent with those found during oxidation at moderate temperature. Furthermore, the addition of Cu(II) reduced proportionally the oxidative stability index of the dried microencapsulated samples.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, <b>dodecyl</b> <b>gallate</b> (DG) and gallic acid (GA) were blended with UHMWPE and {{consolidated}} by compression moulding prior to e-beam irradiation. Stabilisation of highly crosslinked UHMWPE with these polyphenols was examined by tracing post-irradiation oxidation kinetics of UHMWPE {{at room temperature}} with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, in comparison to highly crosslinked vitamin E (VE) -blended and virgin UHMWPE. Phenol loss upon e-beam irradiation depended on the polyphenol chemistry and compatibility with the polyethylene matrix: the oleophilic DG and VE showed higher phenol loss than GA. Nevertheless, all the antioxidant-containing materials exhibit improved oxidation stability compared to virgin material. The formation kinetics of ketones, hydroperoxides, carboxylic acids, esters, and ketoacids were analysed in detail over {{time in order to}} understand the effect of polyphenols on the oxidation mechanism of highly crosslinked UHMWPE. Our results suggest that these polyphenols show limited phenol loss and are protective for highly crosslinked UHMWPE, which may be promising alternative for UHMWPE biomaterials with improved stability.

40|$|Nanofibrillated cellulose, NFC, is an {{interesting}} wood fibre-based material that could be utilized in coatings, foams, composites, packages, dispersions, and emulsions, due to its high tensile strength and barrier properties, light weight, and stabilizing features. To improve applicability and properties of NFC, modification of its surface properties is often needed. In this study, the applicability of laccase-aided surface modification with hydrophobic <b>dodecyl</b> <b>gallate</b> (DOGA) on unbleached NFC was investigated. Also, laccase-catalyzed polymerization of DOGA and other phenolic compounds with lignin moieties was investigated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS). NFC modified with T. hirsuta-based laccase and DOGA showed decreased hydrophilicity, {{as compared with the}} native NFC, when coated on a paper surface. When dried as free-standing films, the surface properties of chemo-enzymatically modified NFC resembled those of the native NFC. The effect of modification was thus greatly influenced by different surface formation in differently prepared samples. Also, changing of the dispersion properties of DOGA by enzymatic polymerization affected the surface properties of the dried NFC samples. Covalent bonding between DOGA and NFC was not the main factor affecting the surface properties of the NFC in free-standing films or coatings...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A series (C 1 to C 16) of alkyl gallates {{was tested}} for their {{antioxidant}} activity for food protection and human health. One molecule of alkyl gallate, regardless of alkyl chain length, scavenges six molecules of 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). Alkyl gallates inhibited the linoleic acid peroxidation catalyzed by soybean lipoxygenase- 1 (EC 1. 13. 11. 12, Type 1) without being oxidized. The progress curves for enzyme reactions were recorded by both spectropho-tometric and polarographic methods and the inhibitory activity was a parabolic function of their lipophilicity (log P) and maximized with alkyl chain length between C 12 and C 16. Tetradecanyl (C 14) gallate exhibited {{the most potent}} inhibition with an IC 50 of 0. 06 µM. The inhibition kinetics of <b>dodecyl</b> <b>gallate</b> (C 12) revealed competitive and slow-binding inhibi-tion. Alkyl gallates chelate transition metal ions and this chelation ability should be of considerable advantage as antioxi-dants.

40|$|Surface {{modification}} of jute fibers {{is necessary to}} improve the adhesion and interfacial compatibility between fibers and resin matrix before using fibers in polymer composites. In this study, <b>dodecyl</b> <b>gallate</b> (DG) was enzymatically grafted onto the jute fiber by laccase to endow the fiber with hydrophobicity. A hand lay-up technique was then adopted to prepare jute/epoxy composites. Contact angle and wetting time measurements showed that the surface hydrophobicity of the jute fabric was increased after the enzymatic graft modification. The water absorption and thickness swelling of the DG-grafted jute fabric/epoxy composite were {{lower than those of}} the other composites. The tensile and dynamic mechanical properties of the jute/epoxy composites were enhanced by the surface modification. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed stronger fibermatrix adhesion in composites with modified fibers. Therefore, the enzymatic graft modification increased the fibermatrix interface area. The fibermatrix adhesion was enhanced, and the mechanical properties of the composites were improved.

40|$|Horseradish {{peroxidase}} (HRP) /H 2 O 2 system catalyzes the free-radical polymerization of aromatic compounds such as lignins and gallate esters. In this work, <b>dodecyl</b> <b>gallate</b> (DG) was grafted {{onto the}} surfaces of lignin-rich jute fabrics by HRP-mediated oxidative polymerization with an aim to enhance the hydrophobicity of the fibers. The DG-grafted jute fibers and reaction products of their model compounds were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results clearly indicated the grafting of DG to the jute fiber by HRP. Furthermore, the hydrophobicity of jute fabrics was determined by measuring the wetting time and static contact angle. Compared to the control sample, the wetting time and static contact angle of the grated fabrics changed from ~ 1 s to 1 h and from ~ 0 ° to 123. 68 °, respectively. This clearly proved that the hydrophobicity of jute fabrics improved considerably. Conditions of the HRP-catalyzed DG-grafting reactions were optimized {{in terms of the}} DG content of modified jute fabrics. Moreover, the results of breaking strength and elongation of DG-grafted jute/ polypropylene (PP) composites demonstrated improved reinforcement of the composite due to enzymatic hydrophobic modification of jute fibers.
