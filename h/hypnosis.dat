5|$|Writer Darin Morgan had {{pieces of}} the script for a long time, drawing {{inspiration}} from research he had done on <b>hypnosis</b> and a book on government coverups and UFOs that theorized that UFOs are a phenomenon that manipulate space and time, but are not piloted by aliens. Morgan had {{the idea for the}} teaser in mind before becoming a staff member on the show. The narrative style was influenced by a casting session Morgan witnessed where an actor auditioning sounded like Truman Capote. From this he {{came up with the idea}} to have a writer covering the case. Capote died in 1984, and second choice Rip Taylor was unavailable, so the role of Jose Chung ended up going to Charles Nelson Reilly. Jesse Ventura was cast as one of the men in black, while the other, which Morgan had originally wanted Johnny Cash for, went to Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek. The role of Lord Kinbote went to stuntman Tony Morelli.|$|E

5|$|When a {{representative}} of the Society of Silent Flower Observers of Southern California comes to the shop to evaluate the plant, she announces that Seymour will receive a trophy from them, and that she will return when the plant's buds open. While Seymour is on a date with Audrey, Mushnick stays at the shop to see that Audrey Jr. does not hurt anyone else. After trading barbs with the plant when Audrey awakens and demands to be fed, Mushnick finds himself at the mercy of Kloy Haddock, a robber who pretended to be a customer of the previous day, and believes that the huge crowd he had observed attending the shop indicated the presence of a large amount of money. To save his own life, Mushnick tricks Haddock into thinking that the money is with the plant, which crushes and eats him. Not only does the monstrous plant's growth increase with this latest meal, but its intelligence and abilities do as well. It intimidates Mr. Mushnick, who is now more terrified than ever, but not so much that he will forgo the money the plant is bringing in as an attraction. After he is forced to damage his relationship with Audrey to keep her from discovering the plant's nature, an angry Seymour confronts the plant asserting he will no longer do its bidding just because it orders him to. The plant then employs <b>hypnosis</b> on the feckless lad and commands him to bring it more food. He wanders the night streets aimlessly until pursued by a rather aggressively persistent street walker Leonora Clyde, intent on making a score. Believing him harmless, she flirts with him to no avail until he inadvertently knocks her out with a rock and carries her back to feed Audrey Jr.|$|E

Weitzenhoffer displays a clear, and explicitly stated, bias against Ericksonian <b>Hypnosis</b> in his book, in favor of what he terms the semi-traditional, scientific, approach.|$|E
25|$|Posthypnotic amnesia {{occurs when}} events during <b>hypnosis</b> are forgotten, or where past {{memories}} {{are unable to}} be recalled. The failure to remember those events is induced by suggestions made during the <b>hypnosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{the general}} {{scientific}} {{consensus is that}} <b>hypnosis</b> cannot induce individuals to engage in conduct {{in which they would}} not otherwise engage, the Model Penal Code, as well as the criminal codes of Montana, New York, and Kentucky do provide <b>hypnosis</b> and hypnotic suggestion as negating volition, and consequently, actus reus.|$|E
25|$|Virtual gastric band uses <b>hypnosis</b> to {{make the}} brain think the stomach is smaller {{than it really is}} and hence lower the amount of food ingested. This brings as a {{consequence}} weight reduction. This method is complemented with psychological treatment for anxiety management and with hypnopedia. Research has been conducted into the use of <b>hypnosis</b> as a weight management alternative. In 1996 a study found that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was more effective for weight reduction if reinforced with <b>hypnosis.</b> Acceptance and Commitment Therapy ACT, a mindfulness approach to weight loss, has also {{in the last few years}} been demonstrating its usefulness.|$|E

25|$|In October 1885, Freud went to Paris on a {{fellowship}} {{to study with}} Jean-Martin Charcot, a renowned neurologist who was conducting scientific research into <b>hypnosis.</b> He was later to recall the experience of this stay as catalytic in turning him toward the practice of medical psychopathology and away from a less financially promising career in neurology research. Charcot specialized {{in the study of}} hysteria and susceptibility to <b>hypnosis,</b> which he frequently demonstrated with patients on stage in front of an audience.|$|E

25|$|Hull's {{experiments}} {{showed the}} reality of some classical phenomena such as mentally induced pain reduction and apparent inhibition of memory recall. However, Hull's work indicated that these effects could be achieved without <b>hypnosis</b> being considered as a distinct state, {{but rather as a}} result of suggestion and motivation, which was a forerunner of the behavioral study of <b>hypnosis.</b> Similarly, moderate increases of certain physical capacities and changes to the threshold of sensory stimulation could be induced psychologically; attenuation effects could be especially dramatic.|$|E
25|$|Milton Hyland Erickson (5 December 1901 â 25 March 1980) was an American {{psychiatrist}} and psychologist specializing in medical <b>hypnosis</b> and family therapy. He was founding {{president of the}} American Society for Clinical <b>Hypnosis</b> and {{a fellow of the}} American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, and the American Psychopathological Association. He is noted for his approach to the unconscious mind as creative and solution-generating. He is also noted for influencing brief therapy, strategic family therapy, family systems therapy, solution focused brief therapy, and neuro-linguistic programming.|$|E
25|$|Hull {{is often}} {{credited}} with having begun the modern study of <b>hypnosis.</b> He {{became interested in}} the field while taking over a pre-medical course on psychology from Jastrow. After successfully putting a disturbed student into a trance with a gifted hypnotic crystal, he began to research the phenomenon and its medical applications. Dissatisfied with the unscientific nature of the field, Hull sought to bring greater academic rigor through measuring behavior instead of relying on self-reports. While teaching, he encouraged his students to do their research with <b>hypnosis,</b> teaching them the techniques involved.|$|E
