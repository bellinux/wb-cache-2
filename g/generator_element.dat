The circuit of the generator is analyzed and mathematical expressions for the most important circuit and impulse current parameters are included. The analytical expression of the impulse current waveform in the distinct operation conditions of the generator, as well as expressions for the calculation of the time constants of the waveform are computed. Moreover arithmetic expressions concerning the range of the <b>generator</b> <b>element</b> values are derived, ensuring that the characteristics of the generated current are in accordance with the limitations of IEC 60060 - 1. These expressions can well facilitate the correct design of the impulse current generator taking under consideration the international standard.

The programme has the ability to calculate the desired configuration and the characteristics of the generated current...|$|E

40|$|SiGe {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{thermoelectric}} materials for high temperature applications. Superlattice structures can further enhance the thermoelectric properties by reducing the thermal conductivity and by increasing the Seebeck coefficient via selective emission of hot electrons through thermionic emission. SiGe/Si superlattice structures were grown on a silicon wafer using molecular beam epitaxy. A single element SiGe/Si superlattice thermoelectric power generator was fabricated and characterized. The device element, a 3 µm thick SiGe/Si superlattice on a 3. 95 µm SiGe buffer layer, was grown on 5 inch diameter 650 microns thick silicon substrate. Output power of 0. 1 W/cm 2 with a resistive load was measured with a temperature drop of 220 °C across the <b>generator</b> <b>element.</b> There was a significant parasitic lead resistance. Simulations show that if the temperature drop is increased to 300 °C, a power density of 1 W/cm 2 can be achieved when working in impedance matching condition...|$|E
40|$|Thermoelectric power {{generators}} are typically {{operating in a}} large temperature difference; indeed the properties of thermoelectric semiconductors vary with temperature. Thus the overall conversion efficiency {{is strongly dependent on}} spatial variations of the material properties according to the temperature profile along the entire thermoelectric <b>generator</b> <b>element.</b> Similarly, a functionally graded module is capable of accomplishing thermal sensors with linearised characteristics over a wide temperature range. The Seebeck-coefficient S {{is a measure of the}} electrically active components in a material. Different components in a single unit become visible by measuring the local S with a scanning thermoprobe. This applies accordingly for the electrical conductivity and therefore the behaviour of the material in a certain temperature gradient becomes predictable. A scanning Seebeck Microprobe has been combined with the measurement of the electric potential along the surface of semiconducting or metallic material. A heated probe tip is placed onto the surface of the sample under investigation, measuring the Seebeck coefficient. Using a specially designed sample holder, an AC current can be applied to the specimen, allowing for the detection of the voltage drop between one current contact and the travelling probe tip. This voltage is proportional to the electrical conductivity at the tip position. With this technique a spatially resolved imaging of the Seebeck coefficient as well as the electrical conductivity can be performed. Furthermore the electrical contact resistance between different materials becomes visible, e. g., in segmented thermoelectric or other devices. ...|$|E

The perovskite oxides are a promising materials system for these metal/semiconductor superlattices due to their diverse range of properties, which allows tuning of the intertwined thermoelectric properties. ^ Lanthanum Strontium Manganate (LSMO) /Lanthanum Manganate (LMO) perovskite oxide metal/semiconductor superlattices were investigated as a potential p-type thermoelectric <b>generator</b> <b>element</b> operating at 800 – 1000 K. Epitaxial superlattices of LSMO (metal) and LMO (p-type semiconductor) were deposited on Strontium Titanate (STO) substrates using pulsed laser deposition in an oxygen ambient. Individual films and superlattice materials were characterized by high-resolution x-ray diffraction, reciprocal space mapping and transmission electron microscopy. ^ LSMO/LMO superlattices exhibited a room temperature thermal conductivity (0. 89 W/m 2 ̆ 6 dot;K) lower than either LSMO (1. 60 W/m 2 ̆ 6 dot;K) or LMO (1. 29 W/m 2 ̆ 6 dot;K) thin films individually. In addition to a low thermal conductivity, a high ZT requires a high power factor, {{the product of the}} electrical conductivity and the square of the Seebeck coefficient. In an effort to perform cross-plane electrical transport measurements, an LSMO/LMO superlattice etch recipe was developed using reactive ion etching. A series of micro-fabrication steps resulted in cylindrical pillars of the superlattice. Cross-plane IV- T measurements yielded preliminary data for cross-plane conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient and the Schottky barrier height. The measured cross-plane conductivities of LSMO/LMO superlattices suggest a combination of magnetic transitions and thermionic behavior. ^ The novel approach of using p-type perovskite oxide superlattices of LSMO/LMO using cross-plane transport has the potential to provide a new high temperature thermoelectric material system. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{is done to}} fulfil {{the requirements of the}} Master of Mechatronic program at the University of Applied Sciences Ravensburg-Weingarten. This {{research is}} about designing a new concept of a brake system using smart materials. Smart materials are materials that receive, transmit or process a stimulus and respond by producing a useful effect. Smart materials have attracted researchers' attention in venturing a new technology that can improve our lives. There are a lot of materials that have been considered as smart materials. In this research a new type of material which is Ferromagnetic Shape Memory Alloy (FSMA) has been chosen. This alloy have significant advantages in term of producing a large scale of output effect and delivering fast response times compared to the other types of materials Based on these factors FSMA can be an appropriate material as an actuator for brake mechanism systems. After the invention of FSMA in early 1990 s by Dr. Kari Ullako, lots of research laboratories has set up new research groups {{in order to have a}} better understanding about this material. Up to now they are still venturing the ways to develop this material as actuators. There are a lot of potential field of application such as couplers element, vibrators element, sensor and <b>generator</b> <b>element,</b> fluidic element and positioning devices. FSMA products that have been made available in the market are linear motor and fluidic pump from Adaptamat Ltd. FSMA has a big potential to replace current mechanical actuator and machinery such as pneumatic and hydraulic. In designing a brake system for robot applications there are several design constraints that need special attention. The design must be light and compact so that it will not become a significant additional load to the robot. In this robot application the brake system has a slightly different requirement. The brake torque is required to provide grips to the rotary shaft and not to stop the wheels. So in this application an initial braking torque is preferred. The research also gives special attention in finding an innovative way to improve the methodology of designing and developing mechatronic products. A new approach using the UML 2. 0 has been used as a modelling technique. The technique is a well proven technique in the software engineering applications and with a minimum modification it is now suitable for the mechatronic engineering. Based on the results that have been achieved in this research the integration of the UML 2. 0 with the Pahl and Beitz design methodology and the V-model has been successful...|$|E
