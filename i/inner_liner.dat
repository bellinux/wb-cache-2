2500|$|The Metrodome's {{air-supported roof}} was {{designed}} by the inventor of air-supported structures, David H. Geiger, through his New York-based Geiger Berger Associates, and manufactured and installed by Birdair Structures. An air-supported structure supported by positive air pressure, it required 250,000ft³/min (120 m³/s) of air to keep it inflated. The air pressure was supplied by twenty 90-horsepower fans. The roof was made of two layers: the outer layers were Teflon-coated fiberglass and the inner was a proprietary acoustical fabric. By design, the dead air space between the layers insulated the roof; in winter, warm air was blown into the space between layers to help melt snow that had accumulated on top. At {{the time it was}} built, the [...] of fabric made the roof the largest expanse ever done in that manner. The outside Teflon membrane was 1/32 of an inch thick and the <b>inner</b> <b>liner</b> of woven fiberglass was 1/64 of an inch thick. The entire roof weighed roughly 580,000 pounds. It reached , or about 16 stories, at its highest point.|$|E

40|$|Wear in the hip {{prosthesis}} due to sliding contact {{as a product}} of human activity is a phenomenon which cannot be avoided. In general, there are two model of hip prostheses which are widely used in total hip replacement, i. e. unipolar and bipolar models. Wear in the bipolar model is more complex than the unipolar model due to its contact motion. The bipolar model has two contact mechanisms while the unipolar model has only one contact mechanism. It means that the bipolar model has two wear positions, i. e. wear on <b>inner</b> and outer <b>liner</b> surface. Fortunately, wear phenomena in the {{hip prosthesis}} can be predicted by analytical or numerical method. Wear on the <b>inner</b> and outer <b>liner</b> surface in the bipolar model itself can be early predicted by contact pressure distribution that is obtained from contact mechanic analysis. The contact pressure distribution itself is an essential variable in wear equations. This paper is aimed to studythe difference of the contact pressure distribution on the <b>inner</b> and outer <b>liner</b> surface in the bipolar model. To obtain the contact pressure distribution at each surface, contact mechanic analysis on the <b>inner</b> and outer <b>liner</b> surface by analytical and numerical method were performed. Results showedthat there was significant difference of the contact pressure distribution on the <b>inner</b> and outer <b>liner</b> surface in the bipolar model. Therefore, it is expected that there is significant wear difference on the <b>inner</b> and outer <b>liner</b> in the bipolar model...|$|R
2500|$|Birdair had {{conducted}} a regular {{inspection of the}} Metrodome roof in April 2010. Its report to the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission stated that [...] "the outer membrane is in good condition and still holding up well", and rated the inner liner's condition as [...] "fair to poor". The inspectors {{also noted that the}} <b>inner</b> <b>liner</b> of the roof was dirty (mostly due to emissions from automotive events) and had some holes in it, advising that the holes be monitored to avoid large tears from enlarging. In addition, Birdair noted some minor areas on the outer membrane that needed repairing, which were done {{by the time of the}} Commission's July regular meeting. Overall, Birdair noted the membrane was weathering as anticipated and had exceeded its service life of 20 years; it recommended planning for replacement of the roof fabric, and noted that planning and implementation would take an additional five years and cost $12–15million. In forming their own conclusion, the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission staff decided that the outer membrane was in very good shape and that the roof continued to have serviceable life, and planned to schedule another testing in four years; the Commission made no recommendations.|$|E

The extruder screw also provides for additional mixing of the compound through the shearing action of the screw. The compound is pushed through a die, after which the extruded profile is vulcanized in a continuous oven, cooled to terminate the vulcanization process, and either rolled up on a spool or cut to length. Tire treads are often extruded with four components in a quadraplex extruder, one with four screws processing four different compounds, usually a base compound, core compound, tread compound, and wing compound.

5000|$|Many free {{standing}} cigarette receptacles utilize an oxygen restricting design that extinguishes still burning butts.

Cigarette butts are deposited {{through a small}} opening and drop down a long neck into the collection chamber. The collection chamber typically houses the removable pail. Other {{free standing}} receptacles, such as those made of pre-cast concrete and stone aggregate materials, rely on water, sand or gravel placed in the collection bin to assist in extinguishing disposed butts. Butt removal and clean-out is accomplished through a door in the receptacle's base, or, the base and top separate to allow access to disposed butts.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the FORMAT methodology, an approach for technological forecasting capable of satisfying the need of manufacturing industries to better support decision-making processes in planning corporate strategies for R&D. The methodology has been developed within the FORMAT consortium, gathering partners from both industry and academia in a Marie-Curie EU funded project of the 7 th Framework Programme - IAPP PEOPLE. The methodology is intentionally shaped as a generic one, so as to foster its adoption by the wider audience, but it suggests the adoption of several TRIZ techniques and models to support the forecast. Its exemplary application in the field of forming technologies for domestic refrigerators aims at showing its potential and viability in a real industrial context.

50|$|During {{bombardment}} service when {{mounted in}} the Lord Clive-class monitors deposition of copper from the projectile driving bands needed frequent removal. However, problems with the <b>inner</b> <b>liners</b> were more serious. The continual drag of the driving bands caused the liner to be gradually stretched forward. The resulting protrusion at the muzzle could simply be cut off, but in addition the liner began to form a ridge in the barrel near {{the shoulders of the}} outer ‘A’ tube, where the inner ‘A’ tube was keyed to the outer.The ridge accumulated copper from the driving bands, which could give sufficient retardation to the projectile to start the fuze, which resulted in a premature detonation either within the bore, or soon after leaving the muzzle. This happened several times during bombardment service, including an occasion when Lord Clive showered pieces of shell over the French destroyer Aventurier.The ‘steel choke’ restriction could be temporarily removed by rubbing down with an emery-covered block pulled {{back and forth in the}} bore, but the only permanent cure was to fit new guns with a modified design of liner, which had a different arrangement of internal shoulders.|$|R
