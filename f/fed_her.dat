5|$|The {{second child}} of Johnstone Melmore and Jessie Francis Leech, Leech {{was born in}} Bendigo in Australia. She was given the name Faith after her elder sister, who died from leukaemia {{at the age of}} two. A {{delicate}} child, Leech had an aversion to eating {{in the first two years}} of her life, so her mother <b>fed</b> <b>her</b> in small hourly doses. Leech was twice rushed from the family home to a Melbourne hospital. Conventional medicine failed to rectify Leech's dietary issues, so her mother put her on a fast for ten days at the recommendation of a naturopath. Leech was later placed on a diet of fruit, salad and vegetables, with an emphasis on beetroot juice and carrot juice.|$|E

2500|$|Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick and Chief Assistant District Attorney Christine Garvey {{argued that}} David Castor's [...] "suicide" [...] {{had never made}} sense {{given the lack of}} his {{fingerprints}} on the glass or container tainted with ethylene glycol, a toxic substance found in antifreeze, and the turkey baster found in the kitchen garbage bearing both ethylene glycol and his DNA.
