6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you are going to say, Mr. Parr,--that it is not practical. That word 'practical' is the barrier between you and your God. I tell you that God can make {{anything}} practical. Your conscience, the spirit, tortures you to-day, but you have not had enough torture, you still think to escape easily, to keep the sympathy of a world which despises you. You are afraid to do what God would have you <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> opportunity, through grace, by your example to leave the world better than you found it, to do a thing of such magnitude as is given to few men, to confess before all that your life has been blind and wicked. That is what the Spirit is trying to teach you. But you fear the ridicule of the other blind men, you have not the faith to believe that many eyes would be opened by your act. The very shame of such a confession, you think, is not to be borne." ...|$|E

60|$|I suppose that, {{taking this}} summer as a whole, {{people will not}} call it an {{appropriate}} time for praising the English climate. But for my part I will praise the English climate till I die--even if I die of the English climate. There is no weather so good as English weather. Nay, {{in a real sense}} there is no weather at all anywhere but in England. In France you have much sun and some rain; in Italy you have hot winds and cold winds; in Scotland and Ireland you have rain, either thick or thin; in America you have hells of heat and cold, and in the Tropics you have sunstrokes varied by thunderbolts. But all these you have on a broad and brutal scale, and you settle down into contentment or despair. Only in our own romantic country <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> strictly romantic thing called Weather; beautiful and changing as a woman. The great English landscape painters (neglected now like everything that is English) have this salient distinction: that the Weather is not the atmosphere of their pictures; it is the subject of their pictures. They paint portraits of the Weather. The Weather sat to Constable. The Weather posed for Turner, and a deuce of a pose it was. This cannot truly be said of the greatest of their continental models or rivals. Poussin and Claude painted objects, ancient cities or perfect Arcadian shepherds through a clear medium of the climate. But in the English painters Weather is the hero; with Turner an Adelphi hero, taunting, flashing and fighting, melodramatic but really magnificent. The English climate, a tall and terrible protagonist, robed in rain and thunder and snow and sunlight, fills the whole canvas and the whole foreground. I admit the superiority of many other French things besides French art. But I will not yield an inch on the superiority of English weather and weather-painting. Why, the French have not even got a word for Weather: and you must ask for the weather in French as if you were asking for the time in English.|$|E

5000|$|He also {{highlights}} several prevalent {{issues in}} ethnomusicology by using hypothetical cases from an American Anthropological Association newsletter and framing {{them in terms}} of ethnomusicology.
