25|$|It {{was agreed}} before the series that {{one half of}} total gate {{receipts}} would be distributed among the players, with the victors receiving the spoils on a winner-takes-all basis. All receipts were put into the bank in a <b>joint</b> <b>account</b> held by the team owners, with no disbursal of funds to take place until one team had won a majority of games in the 7-game series. A similar winner-takes-all allocation of {{the other half of}} the proceeds was made by the respective teams' owners. Total receipts for the series were $13,920.10, from which was first deducted the $100 salaries of the umpires and team travel expenses. The remaining funds were split in half between Browns players and team owner Chris Von der Ahe, with each player taking home slightly over $500.|$|E
25|$|On Friday 14 September 2007, {{the first}} day {{branches}} opened following the news, many customers queued outside branches to withdraw their savings (a run on the bank). This bank run was not the traditional form, where depositors withdraw money in a snowball effect, leading to a liquidity crisis; instead, it occurred {{in the aftermath of}} the liquidity crisis. It was estimated that £1 billion was withdrawn by customers that day, about 5% of the total bank deposits held by Northern Rock. In one incident, police were called to the branch in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, when two <b>joint</b> <b>account</b> holders barricaded the bank manager in her office after she refused to let them withdraw £1 million from their account. Their money was held in an internet-only account, which they were unable to access after the Northern Rock website failed due to the volume of customers trying to log on. Journalists such as the BBC's Robert Peston, who broke the news on his blog, have been seen as one of the main causes of the bank run.|$|E

25|$|It was in {{this climate}} that Matthew Barnett formed a {{partnership}} 'Barnett and Grant'. It came about because Peter Grant had been banned from a racecourse for refusing to leave. Barnett, who had earlier been banned from the same course for life, but who {{had managed to get}} that decision overturned, offered to Grant to bet on a <b>joint</b> <b>account.</b> A win of £100 resulted and although the two never formalised their partnership, their further wins in this first year ran into the thousands. Luck left them, and after the second year they had lost all their earnings again. Luck was with them again, and some time after Grant's wedding in February 1896, they had sufficient capital to add a branch in Christchurch to their existing betting shop in Dunedin. Initially, the Dunedin business had to financially support the Christchurch branch, but under Barnett's business leadership in Christchurch, the situation changed and Christchurch supported the Dunedin branch. The Christchurch premises were in the central city at 174 Hereford Street, and from 1905 {{on the opposite side of}} the road at 163 Hereford Street.|$|E

Miller, a former Delaware congressman, whom Harding had appointed Alien Property Custodian. Smith and Miller received a payoff of {{almost half a}} million dollars for getting a German-owned firm, the American Metal Company, released to new U.S. owners. Smith deposited $50,000 in a <b>joint</b> <b>account</b> with Daugherty, used for political purposes. Records relating to that account were destroyed by Daugherty and his brother. Miller and Daugherty were indicted for defrauding the government. The first trial, in September 1926, resulted in a hung jury; at the second, early in 1927, Miller was convicted and served prison time, but the jury again hung as to Daugherty. Though charges against Daugherty were then dropped, and he was never convicted of any offense, his refusal to take the stand in his own defense devastated what was left of his reputation. The former Attorney General remained defiant, blaming his troubles on his enemies in the labor movement and on the Communists, and wrote that he had [...] "done nothing that prevents my looking the whole world in the face".|$|E

2500|$|The last {{situation}} where a {{presumed resulting trust}} is created is if the court can rebut the presumption of an outright gift. The general philosophy here was set out by James LJ in Fowkes v Pascoe, and is that the judge should base his decision on [...] " [...] story as to how I came to have , and judge that story {{with reference to the}} surrounding facts and circumstances". Where the property is money held in a joint bank account, the presumption {{is that it is a}} joint tenancy of that account. As such, when one dies the property is passed absolutely to the other, as in Marshall v Crutwell. This presumption can be rebutted in several situations. It will be rebutted when the account, while in the name of both the husband and wife, is used exclusively for the husband's personal use, as in Young v Sealey, or where the <b>joint</b> <b>account</b> exists solely so the husband can guarantee the wife's account, as in Anson v Anson. Tax avoidance (which is legal, as opposed to tax evasion) frequently involves transferring property to a family member to avoid tax. Where the family member refuses to transfer it back, the taxpayer can come to court and argue it was a resulting trust.|$|E

60|$|The produce of {{the world}} could not attain {{anything}} approaching to its present amount, nor support anything approaching to the present number of its inhabitants, except upon two conditions: abundant and costly machinery, buildings, and other instruments of production; {{and the power of}} undertaking long operations and waiting a considerable time for their fruits. In other words, there must be a large accumulation of capital, both fixed in the implements and buildings, and circulating, that is employed in maintaining the laborers and their families during the time which elapses before the productive operations are completed and the products come in. This necessity depends on physical laws, and is inherent in the condition of human life; but these requisites of production, the capital, fixed and circulating, of the country (to which has to be added the land, and all that is contained in it), may either be the collective property of those who use it, or may belong to individuals; and the question is, which of these arrangements is most conducive to human happiness. What is characteristic of Socialism is the joint ownership by {{all the members of the}} community of the instruments and means of production; which carries with it the consequence that the division of the produce among the body of owners must be a public act, performed according to rules laid down by the community. Socialism by no means excludes private ownership of articles of consumption; the exclusive right of each to his or her share of the produce when received, either to enjoy, to give, or to exchange it. The land, for example, might be wholly the property of the community for agricultural and other productive purposes, and might be cultivated on their <b>joint</b> <b>account,</b> and yet the dwelling assigned to each individual or family as part of their remuneration might be as exclusively theirs, while they continued to fulfil their share of the common labors, as any one's house now is; and not the dwelling only, but any ornamental ground which the circumstances of the association allowed to be attached to the house for purposes of enjoyment. The distinctive feature of Socialism is not that all things are in common, but that production is only carried on upon the common account, and that the instruments of production are held as common property. The practicability then of Socialism, on the scale of Mr. Owen's or M. Fourier's villages, admits of no dispute. The attempt to manage the whole production of a nation by one central organization is a totally different matter; but a mixed agricultural and manufacturing association of from two thousand to four thousand inhabitants under any tolerable circumstances of soil and climate would be easier to manage than many a joint stock company. The question to be considered is, whether this joint management is likely to be as efficient and successful as the managements of private industry by private capital. And this question has to be considered in a double aspect; the efficiency of the directing mind, or minds, and that of the simple workpeople. And in order to state this question in its simplest form, we will suppose the form of Socialism to be simple Communism, i.e. equal division of the produce among all the sharers, or, according to M. Louis Blanc's still higher standard of justice, apportionment of it according to difference of need, but without making any difference of reward according to the nature of the duty nor according to the supposed merits or services of the individual. There are other forms of Socialism, particularly Fourierism, which do, on considerations of justice or expediency, allow differences of remuneration for different kinds or degrees of service to the community; but the consideration of these may be for the present postponed.|$|E
