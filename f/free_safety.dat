Giants cornerback Everson Walls intercepted two passes—including one that he returned for his first career touchdown—and <b>free</b> <b>safety</b> Greg Jackson intercepted another. Walls' interception set up a Giants touchdown and a 14–0 lead in the second quarter. Jackson then intercepted a pass {{in the end zone}} in the third quarter to preserve a 14–10 lead, and Walls returned his second interception 28yards for a touchdown that made the score 21–10 and put the game of reach in the fourth quarter.|$|E
5|$|During the 2001 regular season, the Hokies' {{defense was}} the second-best in the country, {{allowing}} 237.91 yards per game.

The Hokies were No. 2 in rushing defense (71.64 ypg) and No. 8 in passing defense (166.27 ypg). Defensively, the Hokies {{were led by}} linebacker Ben Taylor, who had 121 tackles (the most on the team) and was named a semifinalist for the Butkus Award, given annually to the best linebacker in the country. <b>Free</b> <b>safety</b> Willie Pile was the team's No. 2 tackler, accumulating 94 tackles, four interceptions, and two fumble recoveries.

5|$|The {{defensive}} backfield, {{often called}} the secondary, consists of cornerbacks (CB) and safeties (S). Safeties are themselves divided into <b>free</b> <b>safeties</b> (FS) and strong safeties (SS). Cornerbacks line up outside the defensive formation, typically opposite of a receiver {{so as to be}} able to cover him, while safeties line up between the cornerbacks but farther back in the secondary. Safeties are the last line of defense, and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as running plays.|$|R
5|$|June was {{selected}} as an honorable mention All-Big Ten performer by both the coaches and the media, despite his late season injury. He was also selected {{to play in the}} 2003 Senior Bowl along with Hobson, B.J. Askew and Joppru. At the 2003 NFL Scouting Combine, June ran the slowest 40-yard dash (4.68seconds) of all the <b>free</b> <b>safeties.</b> June was one of six Wolverines drafted in the 2003 NFL Draft and the first Michigan safety drafted since Corwin Brown in the 1993 NFL Draft.|$|R

5|$|Maryland lost several {{important}} {{players from the}} 2007 team. In January 2008, shortly after Oregon State defeated Maryland in the Emerald Bowl, linebacker Erin Henderson {{announced that he would}} forgo his senior year to enter the 2008 NFL Draft. Henderson, the brother of Butkus and Bednarik Award winner E.J., had recorded an ACC-high four fumble recoveries in 2007 and was the Terrapins' leader in total tackles (133) and tackles for loss (11). The defensive line lost tackles Dre Moore and Carlos Feliciano, while the secondary unit lost both starting safeties, strong safety Christian Varner and <b>free</b> <b>safety</b> J. J. Justice, as well as cornerback Isaiah Gardner. The Maryland offense lost tailbacks Lance Ball and Keon Lattimore who combined for 1,573rushing yards and 25touchdowns in 2007. The offensive line saw the departure of tight ends Jason Goode and Joey Haynos, and offensive guard Andrew Crummey.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{were led}} on defense by All-America {{defensive}} end selection Cornell Brown, who accumulated eight sacks, five other tackles for loss, 19 quarterback hurries, and 58 total tackles {{during the regular}} season and was named a first-team All-Big East selection, signifying his status as the best player at his position in that conference. This followed being named National Defensive Player of the Year {{at the end of the}} previous season. Tech's leading tackler was linebacker Brandon Semones, who accumulated 88 during the season. <b>Free</b> <b>safety</b> Torrian Gray also was a significant presence on the Virginia Tech defense. Gray ranked No. 1 on the team in solo tackles with 58, and was No. 3 in total tackles, with 76. He started every game for Tech during the three seasons immediately prior to the Orange Bowl and was a second-team All-Big East pick in 1996.

5|$|McCoy {{was born}} in Hobbs, New Mexico. He is the eldest of three {{children}} born to Steven Brad McCoy and Debra Kay (Woodruff) McCoy. He attended Jim Ned High School in Tuscola, Texas, population 714, where he was coached in football by his father, Brad McCoy. He achieved several distinctions {{as a high school}} player, including two-time Associated Press 2A Offensive MVP and First-team All-state selection. Over his career, he completed 536-of-849 passes (63.1%) for 9,344 yards and 116 TDs. He ranks as the all-time leading passer in Texas Division 2A high school history and is fourth overall in Texas high school history. McCoy also served as Jim Ned High School's punter as a junior and senior. During his sophomore year, McCoy was also playing <b>free</b> <b>safety.</b> However, after he suffered a concussion while tackling 215-pound Bangs High School running back Jacoby Jones (not {{to be confused with the}} Baltimore Ravens wide receiver of the same name), his father decided not to let him play defense anymore. At the time Jim Ned was 8–0, but as McCoy missed the next two games due to the concussion, Jim Ned's season unraveled. McCoy also played in the 2003 Texas 2A State Championship against the San Augustine Wolves. Jim Ned lost 28–7.|$|E
50|$|The nickelback is {{the third}} cornerback or safety on the depth chart. The nickelback is not {{considered}} a starting position because the starting formation for a defense has only two cornerbacks and two safeties. Defensive formations with three or more cornerbacks (or three safeties) are used often enough that a nickelback will usually see moderate playing time (particularly in the modern, pass-oriented NFL) as well as subbing in for the starting corners. In certain packages (or if injuries depleted the depth chart), smaller <b>free</b> <b>safeties</b> or strong safeties can fill the spot of nickelback, as well. Their role may become that of a pass rusher from outside the box.|$|R
5000|$|The CBS Sports-affiliated NFL Draft Scout {{assessed}} Anderson as the 13th-ranked of the 106 <b>free</b> <b>safeties</b> {{available for}} the 2009 NFL Draft, and considered him as a potential seventh-round selection or free agent. A Scout.com assessment commended his instincts and tackling, but described his size as [...] "marginal for the NFL" [...] {{and said he was}} more suited for zone coverage than man-to-man. Anderson said, [...] "Shoot, I'm like any other person. I'll watch the first 10 picks, or maybe the first round, and then just check on it from time to time. Any NFL fan will watch that first round. Once the second round starts, I’ll be laying around, taking a nap." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Cowboys showed {{confidence}} in Wilcox by not drafting or signing a <b>free</b> agent <b>safety</b> {{to compete with}} him. He would start 16 games and register 89 tackles (fourth on the team), 3 interceptions, 4 passes defensed, one forced fumble and 2 fumble recoveries.|$|R

50|$|During the 2000 NFL season, Robinson {{was one of}} the league's leading <b>Free</b> <b>Safeties</b> with 6 {{interceptions and}} 11 passes. Robinson is best known for the November 4, 2001 event at the Louisiana Superdome. His Jets were leading the New Orleans Saints, 16-9, late in the ball game. After a routine {{offensive}} play, Robinson inexplicably grabbed the face mask of Saints quarterback Aaron Brooks and continually pulled at the mask, bending Brooks backwards. Saints offensive lineman Kyle Turley was furious, and proceeded to grab Robinson's hands, forcing him to release Brooks, before picking him up by the face mask and tackling him to the ground as referees and players from both teams tried to separate them. Turley emerged from the ensuing scrum with Robinson's helmet and proceeded to fling it across the field before making an obscene gesture. Robinson later was fined $20,000 by the NFL for his actions.|$|R

25|$|Tight end Chris Cooley, tackle Chris Samuels, {{and long}} snapper Ethan Albright honored Taylor at the 2008 Pro Bowl by wearing his number 21 {{rather than their}} usual numbers.

25|$|The Steelers {{had some}} success {{advancing}} into Rams territory on their next two possessions, only to see the Rams intercept the ball both times. First, Rams <b>free</b> <b>safety</b> Eddie Brown stopped the ensuing Steelers drive with an interception, lateraling to Pat Thomas to gain an additional two yards. Then after a punt, Pittsburgh drove {{all the way to}} the Rams 16-yard line, but Los Angeles defensive back Rod Perry intercepted a pass intended for Stallworth. Thus, the third quarter ended with the Rams still in the lead, 19–17, seemingly in control of the game. Worse yet, Pittsburgh lost Swann to injury, when he was knocked out of the game by Pat Thomas.|$|E
25|$|On April 30, 2007, a {{day after}} the NFL Draft, the Rams added {{nineteen}} undrafted free agents to their roster. The most notable addition was Iowa quarterback Drew Tate.

They added Boise State fullback Brad Lau, Nevada running back Robert Hubbard, University of Pittsburgh tight end Steve Buches, University of Washington guard Stanley Daniels, and Massachusetts guard David Thompson to the Rams' offense. They also added four defensive backs: Alabama <b>free</b> <b>safety</b> Jeffery Dukes, Kent State strong safety Andre Kirklan, Arkansas cornerback Darius Vinnett and Villanova cornerback Terrance Reaves.

50|$|Regarded {{as one of}} {{the best}} <b>free</b> <b>safeties</b> to have ever played the game, he was a six-time Pro Bowl {{selection}} from 1983-1988, starting in five of them in his 11 years with the Chiefs. Few other Chiefs players have been selected to this number of Pro Bowls. He had six 100 tackle seasons in his eleven years as a member of the Chiefs, with a career total of 927 tackles. He was a 5 time All-Pro in 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1988. He was also a five-time 1st team All-AFC and two time 2nd team All-AFC selection. Cherry's 15 career fumble recoveries place him in a three-way tie for the Chiefs record. He ranks third on the Chiefs list of most interceptions, and is only the 26th player in the history of the NFL to reach the 50 interception plateau. In 1987, he was selected to the Chiefs 25 year All-Time Team.|$|R
