A study examining the impact of cognitive <b>intervention</b> for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found that children who received such <b>intervention</b> for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who were randomly assigned to the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received <b>intervention</b> achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no <b>intervention)</b> condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{application}} of evidence-based lifestyle <b>interventions</b> is suboptimal, but {{little is known}} what <b>interventions</b> are actually used. This study aimed to explore the range of lifestyle <b>interventions</b> used in Dutch ambulatory health care settings. METHOD: We conducted interviews (n = 67) in purposefully selected hospitals, general practices, and community care organizations. Interviews focused on identifying activities to help patients stop smoking, reduce alcohol consumption, increase physical activity, eat a healthy diet, and lose weight. We also asked who developed the <b>interventions.</b> All reported activities were registered and analyzed. RESULTS: Four categories of health promotion activities emerged: giving advice, making referrals, offering counseling, and providing lifestyle <b>interventions</b> organized separately from the care process. In total, 102 lifestyle <b>interventions</b> were reported. Forty-five <b>interventions</b> were developed by researchers, of which 30 were developed by the Dutch Expert Center on Tobacco Control. Providers {{did not know the}} source of 31 <b>interventions.</b> Eighteen <b>interventions</b> were developed by the providers themselves, and eight were based on evidence-based guidelines.

40|$|BackgroundMicronutrient powders (MNP) reduce anemia {{and improve}} iron status in {{children}} aged 6 to 23 months. Little {{is known about}} home fortification <b>interventions</b> in low-income and middle-income countries. ObjectiveTo describe highlights of the Global Assessment of Home Fortification <b>Interventions</b> 2011, new directions, and needed policy and programmatic guidance. MethodsA cross-sectional survey of home fortification <b>interventions</b> was conducted. Staff at UNICEF and regional focal points at Home Fortification Technical Advisory Group partner agencies sent questionnaires to representatives in 152 low-income and middle-income countries. Included <b>interventions</b> met the following criteria: they were for prevention and used MNP, lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS), or complementary food supplements (CFS); one recommended mode of use was mixing into food; they were implemented or planning to start within 12 months; and research <b>interventions</b> were directly linked to programs. ResultsThis study identified 63 implemented <b>interventions</b> (36 countries) and 28 planned <b>interventions</b> (21 countries), including 34 implemented <b>interventions</b> (22 countries) and 25 planned <b>interventions</b> (20 countries) that used MNP. These <b>interventions</b> were expected to reach 17. 2 million people in 2011, including 14. 1 million participants in MNP <b>interventions.</b> Among implemented <b>interventions,</b> 16 % distributed nationally. Most <b>interventions</b> used integrated approaches targeting young children. Recently, there was increasing expansion of <b>interventions</b> in Africa.

ConclusionsHome fortification <b>interventions,</b> especially those that use MNP, are increasing and scaling up rapidly in regions with widespread problems of micronutrient deficiencies and stunting. Home fortification <b>interventions</b> contribute to global initiatives to reduce undernutrition. 2015 - 08 - 24 T 00 : 00 : 00 ZPMC 454746...|$|R

One example is of a successful humanitarian <b>intervention</b> and also of humanitarian principles being applied is East Timor which, prior to its independence, was plagued with massive human rights abuses by pro-Indonesian militias and an insurgency war led by indigenous East Timorese against Indonesian forces. A peacekeeping mission was deployed to safeguard the move to independence and the UN established the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). This not only dealt with traditional security priorities, but also helped in nation building projects, coordinated humanitarian aid and civil rehabilitation, illustrating not only a successful humanitarian <b>intervention</b> but also an effective application of human security principles.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this article was to review primary {{prevention}} <b>interventions</b> targeting childhood obesity implemented in the after school environment from 2006 and 2011. A total of 20 <b>interventions</b> were found from 25 studies. Children in the <b>interventions</b> ranged from kindergarten to middle schoolers, however a majority was in the 4 th and 5 th grades. Most of the <b>interventions</b> targeted both physical activity and dietary behaviors. Among those that focused on only one dimension, physical activity was targeted more than diet. The duration of the <b>interventions</b> greatly varied, but many were short-term or brief. Many <b>interventions</b> were also based on some behavioral theory, with social cognitive theory as the most widely used. Most of the <b>interventions</b> focused on short-term changes, and rarely did any perform a follow-up evaluation. A major limitation among after school <b>interventions</b> was an inadequate use of process evaluations. Overall, <b>interventions</b> resulted in modest changes in behaviors and behavioral antecedents, and results were mixed and generally unfavorable with regards to indicators of obesity.
