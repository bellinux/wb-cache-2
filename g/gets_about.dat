25|$|Mississippi has a humid {{subtropical}} climate with long summers and short, mild winters. Temperatures average about 81°F (about 27°C) in July and about 48°F (about 9°C) in January. The temperature varies little statewide in the summer; however, in winter, the region near Mississippi Sound is significantly warmer than the inland {{portion of the}} state. The recorded temperature in Mississippi has ranged from , in 1966, at Corinth in the northeast, to , in 1930, at Holly Springs in the north. Heavy snowfall is possible across the state, such as during the New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm. Yearly precipitation generally increases from north to south, with the regions closer to the Gulf being the most humid. Thus, Clarksdale, in the northwest, <b>gets</b> <b>about</b> 50inches (about 1,270mm) of precipitation annually and Biloxi, in the south, about 61inches (about 1,550mm). Small amounts of snow fall in northern and central Mississippi; snow is occasional {{in the southern part}} of the state.|$|E

500|$|According to the Birmingham Mail end-of-season review, [...] "for most of {{the season}} no other midfielder could {{challenge}} [...] in terms of energy, tackles, clearances or blocks", and he was a close second to 16-goal striker Clayton Donaldson as their player of the season. Nevertheless, he lost his starting spot to new signing Maikel Kieftenbeld, and Rowett thought that his anxiety to regain his place in the team made him try too hard when coming on as a substitute. After a strong performance in the League Cup against Premier League Aston Villa, Davis started and played well in two consecutive away wins, but his next start did not come until mid-March. Away to Wolverhampton Wanderers, he came close to scoring the winning goal and, according to Rowett, [...] "controlled the match with his physicality. He <b>gets</b> <b>about</b> the place, he holds people off and comes out with the ball. He does that really, really well." [...] The club promptly took up their option for a further year on his contract, and Rowett said they were considering an extension until 2018. Davis scored his first goal of the season in the penultimate match, a [...] "brilliant half-volley {{from the edge of the}} area" [...] after the ball was not fully cleared by the defence, to secure a draw at home to Middlesbrough. Although he started a third fewer Championship matches than in 2014–15, he established himself in the team towards the end of the season because of what the Birmingham Mail viewed as the stability he gave to the side.|$|E
