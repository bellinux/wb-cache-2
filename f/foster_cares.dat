50|$|<b>Foster</b> <b>care</b> {{has had a}} {{long history}} in India, first {{initiated}} in the 1960s by the central government. The first non-institutional scheme was introduced in Maharashtra in 1972. The scheme was later revised in 2005 as the 'Bal Sangopal Scheme - Non Institutional Services'. In the late 1990s Karnataka implemented a <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> scheme focused on destitute children. Emergency schemes were operational even in Gujarat, after the 2001 earthquake where around 350 children were rehabilitated with their relatives and neighbours in the community. However, although the JJ Act presently provides for <b>foster</b> <b>care,</b> it is not being implemented effectively. Very few state governments have developed <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> programs. <b>Foster</b> <b>care</b> is still largely used as a pre-adoption procedure, which is limiting the potential of this method to provide family care to children.

40|$|<b>Foster</b> <b>care</b> is a {{fundamental}} component of the child welfare system. Traditionally, <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> has been viewed as the primary mechanism for caring for children placed outside of their home, and {{is considered one of}} the central intervention strategies for child welfare practitioners. <b>Foster</b> <b>care</b> services are regularly recommended for children who are abused and neglected. In 2011, there were an estimated 401, 000 youths in <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> and approximately 646, 000 youth were served by the <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> system. Yet, despite the importance of <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> to child welfare, social work literature in general, and child welfare literature specifically, is devoid of a well-defined, conceptual framework for what success in <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> really means, from the perspective of those most impacted: foster youth. This study delineated a conceptual domain for successful <b>foster</b> <b>care,</b> from the perspective of teens in <b>foster</b> <b>care,</b> and explored differences in this conceptualization, based on maltreatment type. Method: This study utilized a sample of youth, currently in <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> in Kentucky and employed a mixed-method approach known as Concept Mapping (CM). CM combines multi-dimensional scaling with hierarchical cluster analyses to form factors relevant to an area of study. This method allowed for foster youth to actively be involved in the study, and is suited to delineate a conceptual framework for defining success in <b>foster</b> <b>care.</b> Results: Data were analyzed utilizing The Concept Systems™ proprietary software. Results indicate that teens in <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> conceptualize success based on four distinct clusters: Social Work, Foster Parent(s), Foster Agency, and Foster Youth. Further, based on rating analyses, participants in <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> for abuse (to include physical and sexual), did not conceptualize success differently when compared to youth in <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> for neglect. Conclusion: This study revealed that success is a complex, multi-faceted construct. Youth in this study conceptualized success based on a number of distinct deas. Stakeholders involved with <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> research, programming, and policy development must take into account this multi-dimensional conceptualization. Further, this study demonstrated that foster youth are able to take part in research studies, and should be involved in <b>foster</b> <b>care</b> research and programming endeavors...|$|R
