Recent studies that employ non-contact excitation and response measurement techniques (Chakravarty 2013; Siringoringo and Fujino 2009; Ameri et al. 2012; Xu and Zhu 2013) indicate that laser vibrometry is a popular tool to obtain the dynamic properties of membranes.|$|R

50|$|An ideal {{impact to}} a {{structure}} {{is a perfect}} impulse, which has an infinitely small duration, causing a constant amplitude in the frequency domain; this would result in all modes of vibration being excited with equal energy. The <b>impact</b> <b>hammer</b> test is designed to replicate this; however, in reality a hammer strike cannot last for an infinitely small duration, but has a known contact time. The duration of the contact time directly influences the frequency content of the force, with a larger contact time causing a smaller range of bandwidth. A load cell {{is attached to the}} end of the hammer to record the force. <b>Impact</b> <b>hammer</b> testing is ideal for small light weight structures; however as the size of the structure increases issues can occur due to a poor signal to noise ratio. This is common on large civil engineering structures.|$|E

For lighter anchors a hand tool is often sufficient.|$|E

40|$|Automotive seat rattle {{has a large}} {{contribution}} in customer NVH satisfaction, {{as there is a}} close interface between the passengers and seat. The vibration from the road and other sources in the car like the engine are transmitted to the seat through the different paths which can be the cause of rattling noise in different frequency ranges from the seat. Seat structure as well as its components can be sources of rattle noise based on their physical characteristics. Therefore the main objective of this project was to characterize the acoustic signature of the seat rattle noise which can be used for noise source identification and structural NVH optimization. For this purpose, different noise measurement and structural tests were done on a Holden VE passenger seat manufactured by FUTURIS Company. A sine sweep from 5 - 100 Hz was used as the input vibration for the tests to simulate the real life driving conditions and the vibration and noise responses of the seat were measured and analysed using different equipment and software packages. The methods used included modal testing and analysis, noise measurement and <b>impact</b> <b>hammering</b> test on different seat components. The seat was divided in to 3 main areas including: Rails, Seatback and Headrest. The obtained major rattle noise frequencies were correlated with corresponding structural modal frequencies. This comparison and additional <b>impact</b> <b>hammering</b> results lead us to identify the acoustic signatures and corresponding sources of the seat rattle noise. The acoustic signatures database has therefore been developed for the automotive seat...|$|R
40|$|A steel {{monopile}} is {{the most}} common foundation type of a wind turbine installed offshore and is driven into place with the help of vibratory or <b>impact</b> <b>hammers.</b> Underwater noise generated during the installation of steel monopiles has recently received considerable attention from international environmental organizations and regulatory bodies in various nations. Collected data regarding underwater noise measurements indicate that pile driving operations, especially when <b>impact</b> <b>hammers</b> are used, can be potentially harmful for the marine ecosystem. In this paper, a linear semi-analytical model is developed {{for the study of the}} vibroacoustic behaviour of a coupled pile-soil-water system. The hammer is substituted by an external force applied at the head of the pile. The pile is described by a thin shell theory, whereas both soil and water are modelled as threedimensional continua. The solution is based on the dynamic sub-structuring technique. The total system is divided into two subsystems namely, the shell structure and the soil-fluid medium. The response of each sub-domain is expressed as a summation over a complete set of eigenfunctions. The orthogonality of the shell modes in vacuo and the bi-orthogonality of the acoustoelastic modes is utilized in order to meet the displacement compatibility and the force equilibrium at the interface of the two sub-systems. With the developed model, the wave radiation due to vibratory and impact pile driving is analysed. The influence of soil elasticity and soil stratification on the dynamics of the coupled system is examined. In addition, the energy launched by the hammer into the water and into the soil is investigated for both excitation types in order to highlight the main differences in the generated wave field.

50|$|For large civil {{engineering}} structures much larger shakers are used, which can weigh 100kg and above and apply {{a force of}} many hundreds of newtons. Several types of shakers are common: rotating mass shakers, electro-dynamic shakers, and electrohydraulic shakers. For rotating mass shakers the force can be calculated from knowing the mass and the speed of rotation; for the electro-dynamic shaker the force can be obtained through a load cell, or an accelerometer placed on the moving mass of the shaker. Shakers can have an advantage over the <b>impact</b> <b>hammer</b> as they can supply more energy to a structure {{over a longer period}} of time. However, problems can also be introduced; shakers can influence the dynamic properties of the structure and can also increase the complexity of analysis due to windowing errors.|$|E
50|$|Methods {{from this}} group attempt to derive ICP from {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} skull bones rather than of the intracranial content. The underlying assumption {{is similar to that}} of the ultrasound time of the flight techniques: that the skull is not completely rigid, so that changes in ICP result in a small but measurable skull expansion which creates additional stress within the skull bones and modifies their mechanical properties. The transfer function is derived by applying a wide-band, low frequency (<100 Hz) mechanical excitation at one location on the skull (via a piezo-tranducer or an <b>impact</b> <b>hammer)</b> and comparing its spectrum to that of a signal received at another location on the upper half of skull. It is proposed that the measurement be self-calibrated by obtaining the frequency response spectrum from a point on the base of the skull of the same subject, which is assumed not to be affected by ICP, or alternatively, pre-calibrated on subjects with normal ICP.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Properties of {{light-weight}} concrete congaing lightweight {{expanded clay}} aggregate differ from the ones of normal-weight concrete containing natural normal-weight aggregate.

Properties of expanded clay lightweight aggregate influence the ones of light-weight concrete, too. Parameters obtained by means of Schmidt <b>impact</b> <b>hammer</b> non-destructive testing are influenced by series of factors, among others also concrete moisture. Moisture of light-weight concrete containing lightweight aggregate influences rebound number of Schmidt <b>impact</b> <b>hammer.</b> As to Schmidt <b>impact</b> <b>hammer</b> type N (2. 25 Nm impact energy), rebound number on dry concrete exceeds the one on waterlogged concrete by 21 %.

The forging process {{goes back to}} 8000 B.C. and evolved from the manual art of simple blacksmithing. Then as now, a series of compressive hammer blows performs the shaping or forging of the part. Modern forging uses machine driven <b>impact</b> <b>hammers</b> or presses which deform the work-piece by controlled pressure.The forging process is superior to casting in that the parts formed have denser microstructures, more defined grain patterns, and less porosity, making such parts much stronger than a casting. All metals and alloys are forge-able, but each will have a forge-ability rating from high to low or poor. The factors involved are the material’s composition, crystal structure and mechanical properties all considered within a temperature range. The wider the temperature range, the higher the forge-ability rating. Most forging is done on heated work-pieces. [...] "Cold forging" [...] can occur at room temperatures. The most forge-able materials are aluminum, copper, and magnesium. Lower ratings are applied to the various steels, nickel, and titanium alloys.
