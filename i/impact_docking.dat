Feustel also installed two of four Latch Over Center Kits, or LOCKs, that make opening and closing Hubble's large access doors easier for the remaining spacewalks. The spacewalk officially ended at 20:12 UTC, for a time of seven hours and twenty minutes. It was the nineteenth spacewalk devoted to servicing the telescope, and brought the total time in servicing Hubble to one hundred thirty-six hours, thirty minutes. Due to the length of the spacewalk, and the delay in beginning, the crew was over an hour behind their scheduled timeline for the day, but worked through the post-EVA activities and evening activities without problems, and got to sleep only slightly behind their scheduled time. During the mission status briefing, David Leckrone, Hubble Project Senior Scientist, noted he was very relieved that the camera was replaced successfully, and noted that the problems with the bolt caused some concern, [...] "I don't normally reveal my age and I'm not going to here, but I can tell you I'm five years older now than I was when I came to work this morning, we can sleep pretty well tonight, knowing that's been accomplished." ...|$|E

40|$|Broadleaf dock (Rumex obtusifolius L.) {{is one of}} most {{frequently}} arising problem weed in permanent pasture. Numerous publications concern themselves with biology and ecology whereas little information is available quantifying the economic <b>impacts</b> of <b>dock</b> on forage grass yield and quality. Over {{the course of several}} growing seasons experiments were conducted in three pasture locations in Saxony and Thuringia (Germany). Dock infestation, yield proportions, yield of grass and dock and the forage value were measured always. The specific dry matter yield of R. obtusifolius is smaller than from L. perenne. With increasing dock settling the total forage yield is not affected negatively nevertheless. From this a potential increased yield follows after the improving the sward. The yield proportion of dock on the total yield can be reliably estimated over a mathematical function from the ground cover of dock, whereas due to the expanded variability in the size of single plants the number of plants was unsuitable for that. In populations grown up at same location the nutrient value of dock was regularly below the nutrient value of the grass component.

In this first experiment, the effects of Reaction Control System design characteristics and rotational control laws were evaluated during simulated proximity operations and docking. Also, the influence of piloting demands resulting from varying closure rates was assessed.

In particular, cross-coupling between translational and rotational motions significantly affected handling qualities as reflected by Cooper-Harper pilot ratings and pilot workload, as reflected by Task-Load Index ratings. This influence is masked but only slightly by the rotational control system mode. While rotational control augmentation using Rate Command Attitude Hold can reduce the workload (principally, physical workload) created by cross-coupling, the handling qualities are not significantly improved.

We use a test set of 100 PDB protein-ligand complexes and ensembles of 101 docked positions generated by Wang et al [2] for each ligand in the test set. To test the suggested method we compare the averaged root-mean square deviations (RMSD) of the top-scored ligand docked positions, accounting and not accounting for entropy contributions, relative to the experimentally determined positions. We demonstrate that the method increases docking accuracy by 10 - 21 % when used in conjunction with the AutoDock scoring function, by 2 - 25 % with G-Score, by 7 - 41 % with D-Score, by 0 - 8 % with LigScore, by 1 - 6 % with PLP, by 0 - 12 % with LUDI, by 2 - 8 % with F-Score, by 7 - 29 % with ChemScore, by 0 - 9 % with X-Score, by 2 - 19 % with PMF, and by 1 - 7 % with DrugScore.

40|$|The {{neuronal}} serine/threonine kinase {{cyclin-dependent kinase}} 5 (Cdk 5) is activated by its regulatory subunit, p 35, to post-translationally modify substrates through phosphorylation. In this thesis, I provide several lines {{of evidence that}} Cdk 5 plays {{a critical role in}} synaptic function and plasticity. First, we characterized the function of Cdk 5 in learning and memory by region-specific Cdk 5 ablation. From multiple Cdk 5 conditional knockout mouse models, we determined that Cdk 5 is essential for memory formation and synaptic plasticity. Loss of Cdk 5 in the hippocampus disrupts the cAMP pathway due to increased phosphodiesterase proteins. This dysregulation of cAMP signaling can be attenuated by a phosphodiesterase inhibitor to restore levels of protein phosphorylation, synaptic plasticity, and memory. Moreover, forebrain-specific deletion of Cdk 5 affected multiple aspects of behavior that can partially be rescued by lithium treatment. We next identified the N-type calcium channels as a presynaptic substrate of Cdk 5. We described how Cdk 5 -mediated phosphorylation of the N-type calcium channel increased calcium influx and channel open probability. This in turn enhanced the association of the N-type calcium channel with the active zone protein RIM 1, which <b>impacted</b> vesicle <b>docking</b> and neurotransmission. Finally, we identified the postsynaptic density protein Shank 3 as a Cdk 5 substrate and observed that Cdk 5 -mediated phosphorylation of Shank 3 plays a critical role in maintaining dendritic spine morphology and synaptic plasticity. Our collective results demonstrate a central role for Cdk 5 in regulating both presynaptic and postsynaptic functions and provide better insight into how specific targets of Cdk 5 can impact a general mechanism underlying synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function. by Susan C.

We investigated possible correlations between the protein flexibility and different 3 D structural parameters and found that a region flexibility correlate with population of certain amino acid residues, the protein solvent accessible surface area and B-factors. The set of protein regions characterized by flexibility and the results obtained should be valuable in testing the new apriori procedures, but also the procedure itself can be used in discrimination the regions in proteins by flexibility...|$|R

Compared to the larger spatial scale at which some human activities affect estuaries and their seagrasses (e. g. catchment disturbance, dredging, pollution, trawling), recreational boating and infrastructure of moorings and docks act at smaller scales.

40|$|The CCR 7 ligands CCL 19 and CCL 21 are {{increasingly}} recognized as functionally different (biased). Using mature human dendritic cells (DCs), {{we show that}} CCL 19 is more potent than CCL 21 in inducing 3 D chemotaxis. Intriguingly, CCL 21 induces prolonged and more efficient ERK 1 / 2 activation compared to CCL 19 and to a C-terminal truncated (tailless) CCL 21 in DCs. In contrast, tailless-CCL 21 displays increased potency in DC chemotaxis compared to native CCL 21. Using a CCL 21 -specific antibody, we show that CCL 21, but not tailless-CCL 21, accumulates at the cell surface. In addition removal of sialic acid from the cell surface by neuraminidase treatment impairs ERK 1 / 2 activation by CCL 21, but not of CCL 19 or tailless-CCL 21. Using standard laboratory cell-lines, we observe low potency of both CCL 21 and tailless-CCL 21 in G protein activation and -arrestin recruitment compared to CCL 19, indicating that the tail itself does not improve receptor interaction. Chemokines interact with their receptors in a stepwise manner with ultimate docking of their N-terminus into the main binding pocket. Employing site-directed mutagenesis we identify residues in this pocket of selective CCL 21 importance. We also identify a molecular switch {{in the top of}} TM 7 important for keeping CCR 7 in an inactive conformation (Tyr 312), as introduction of the chemokine receptor-conserved Glu (or Ala) induces high constitutive activity.

40|$|NASA is {{developing}} a new docking system to support future space exploration missions to low-Earth orbit, the Moon, and Mars. This mechanism, called the Low <b>Impact</b> <b>Docking</b> System (LIDS), is designed to connect pressurized space vehicles and structures including the Crew Exploration Vehicle, International Space Station, and lunar lander. NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is playing {{a key role in}} developing the main interface seal for this new docking system. These seals will be approximately 147 cm (58 in.) in diameter. GRC is evaluating the performance of candidate seal designs under simulated operating conditions at both sub-scale and full-scale levels. GRC is ultimately responsible for delivering flight hardware seals to NASA Johnson Space Center around 2013 for integration into LIDS flight units...|$|E
