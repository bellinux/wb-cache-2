25|$|The D type was {{modified}} {{for use on}} unarmed, long-range photo-reconnaissance versions of the Spitfire, such as the P.R. Mk Id (P.R. versions {{described in more detail}} below), with weapon bays left empty, and the relatively heavy-skinned leading edge wing structure ahead of the main spar converted to integral auxiliary fuel tanks capable of carrying 66½ Imperial gallons (300 l) in addition to that stored in the fuselage tanks ahead of the cockpit. The filler caps were well outboard, between ribs 19 and 20 on the leading edge, because the wing tips were higher {{than the rest of the}} wing due to dihedral, and thus the only place a <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> could be located. An expansion and overflow vent was fitted to protect the tanks from bursting as the fuel vaporized and expanded from the hot sun beating directly on the thin metal wing skin (which doubled as the walls of the tank). This vent was fitted further outboard, between ribs 20 and 21, in the highest space in the tank, where vapor would naturally collect.|$|E
2500|$|Riding {{the same}} {{wheelbase}} as the sedan, the liftback was {{identical to the}} sedan from the A-pillar forward and featured a sloping roof (compromising rear headroom) and a hatchback with a more shallow Kammback tail. The rear license plate hid the <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>cap.</b> The Spirit offered a generous cruising range with its [...] "fuel tank capacity of 21 gallons and probable fuel mileage of 25 mpg or more... enabling the car's driver to travel over 500 miles between fill ups".|$|E

Hudson Ramblers also received [...] "H" [...] symbols on <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> (and, in 1956, also on hubcaps). For 1957, Rambler and Metropolitan became makes in their own rights, and no longer {{were identified as}} Hudson or Nash.|$|R
2500|$|The road racing {{version of}} the XR-750 used an {{aluminum}} oil tank, had a [...] fiberglass fuel tank, and a fiberglass fairing which included extra heat shielding to protect the rider's left leg when riding in a tuck position. On the top center of the fuel tank was a leather pad with a round cutout for the left-side <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>cap.</b> Like the dirt tracker, it used a Ceriani fork and Girling shocks, two 36mm Mikuni carburetors and tuned dual reverse cone exhaust. Instrumentation consisted of a Smiths tachometer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{front end}} of the Range Rover was revamped in 1986. This brought a more pedestrian-friendly plastic grille with {{horizontal}} slats, and optional front valance with two fog lights. The seat base was lowered and door handles were redesigned, making it more difficult for rear passengers but greatly improving the comfort for taller people in the front. The dashboard switchgear was updated again, now featuring steering column stalks from the Austin Montego, and other miscellaneous items from the Austin Rover car range. [...] Other changes included the windows, tailgate and bonnet, but none of those affected the general design. Bonnet and door hinges gradually evolved out of sight and the <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> was hidden behind a hinged flap. [...] The last major change to the interior took place in 1994, when the Range Rover was re-designated [...] "Classic" [...] upon the arrival of the replacement P38A version. The car gained a 'soft feel' safety dashboard (derived from that used in the facelifted Series 1 Discovery) with new switches (this time lifted from the Rover 800) and instruments. [...] These end of the line models are popularly called [...] "soft dash" [...] models by the motor trade and by enthusiasts to distinguish them from other members of the Range Rover Classic series.|$|E

50|$|At {{the front}} of the car a new bumper removed the original’s fake central grille and also {{replaced}} the Ferrari prancing horse emblem. The side intake cooling ducts were enlarged and the engine cover was replaced with a glass item allowing a view of the V8 engine. A new triple tail-light arrangement and an electronically operated spoiler were added. A double bubble roof was added, the idea being that Zagato could lower the roofline of a car, but retain enough headroom for each occupant. Other modifications included custom OZ Racing alloy wheels, external <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> and a completely reworked interior including a three-inch rear view screen and suede upholstery. Zagato initially announced a production run of 22 examples, but only 10 or 12 cars were made.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1984, {{there were}} more {{equipment}} upgrades made across the range. The 1.3 base models gained reclining front seats, door bins, locking <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> and clocks. The L models gained cloth door trim, upgraded upholstery, and remote-adjustable driver's side door mirrors; the 1.6 Ls gained five-speed gearboxes. The 1.3 HLEs gained five-speed [...] "4+E" [...] gearboxes with overdrive fifth gear ratios, side mouldings, tweed cloth upholstery and remotely adjustable passenger's side door mirrors. The HLS and 1.6 automatics gained tinted glass, central locking, electric front windows, velour upholstery and upgraded radio-cassette players. The MG Maestros gained electronic fuel-injected [...] versions of the 2-litre O-Series engine, uprated suspension and ventilated front disc brakes, colour-keyed exterior trim, tinted glass, central locking and leather-trimmed steering wheels. The new MG Maestro offered much better performance and refinement than its predecessor.|$|R
5000|$|The later Mk IIs and {{approximately}} the first 4,000 Mk IIIs had a later type of [...] "beetle back" [...] {{with an additional}} small window on the left front side and windows in both doors. A canvas roof was mounted on a cruciform steel frame over the crew compartment, {{and there were two}} square vents in the roof behind the canvas section.

5000|$|The ABC Robin was a British single-seat light {{aircraft}} designed by A. A. Fletcher in 1929. It was a high-wing, single-seat monoplane of conventional taildragger configuration. The cockpit was fully enclosed, the first lightplane {{to be so}} equipped in Britain. [...] It was designed {{at the request of}} T.A.Dennis (Managing Director) specifically to utilise the firm's 30-40 h.p. Scorpion engine.Construction was primarily of wood with metal confined to fittings and a few highly stressed parts. The fuselage was constructed as a wooden box consisting of four spruce longerons with thin plywood covering with light internal bulkheads. The wood-framed wings, of RAF 34 section, were hinged at their inner rear corners {{to the top of the}} fuselage and supported by tubular struts in 'Vee' formation to the lower longerons of the fuselage. The tail was also wood-framed and both wings and tail were covered with doped fabric. The Robin, registered G-AAID, was built by ABC Motors Limited at Walton-on-Thames in 1929. The first flight was at Brooklands in June, and it was displayed at the Olympia Aero Show in July. It was modified later in the year with the windscreen moved back to allow access to the <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> from the outside, and with an enlarged fin and rudder. The sole Robin built was scrapped at Brooklands in 1932.|$|R
5000|$|Testing {{continued}} until February 18, 1943, {{when the second}} prototype crashed. Flown by Boeing's chief test pilot, Edmund T. [...] "Eddie" [...] Allen on a two-hour powerplant performance test, leaking <b>fuel</b> from a <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> in the wing leading edge ran down inside the leading-edge and ignited, spreading to the engines. Due to the much reduced power, the aircraft, unable to climb, crashed into the Frye meat-packing plant, demolishing {{the majority of the}} packing plant and killing all eleven crew, 22 employees at the plant and one fireman. The crash killed many élite Boeing personnel involved in the design; the pilot, Allen, was chief of the Research Division. After the crash, the United States Army Air Forces and a congressional committee headed by then-Senator Harry S. Truman investigated the B-29 program issuing a scathing report, prompting the Army Air Forces {{to take control of the}} program.|$|R
40|$|The {{composite}} SARAS wing is a wet {{fuel tank}} enclosed by end ribs at station # 4, # 6 and # 20, rear spar, front spar, front beam, top skin and bottom skin. The fuel pressure is {{developed in the}} tank area due to the aircraft acceleration. The objective {{of this study is}} to check the safety of wing against combined effect of the critical air load and fuel pressure on the wing structure acting simultaneously. Static and buckling analysis of the wing for the combined critical air load case and fuel pressure case for ultimate load have been carried out to check the safety of the structure. Detailed studies have been made to understand the effect of fuel pressure at the skin to rib and skin to spar joints using the results of global FE analysis. The bolts pull through load on top flange and T-pull load on bottom flange of all ribs and spars have been extracted based on the analysis. This is to ensure the safety of bolted joints on top side against bolt pull load and co-cured joints on bottom side against T-pull load. The strains are extracted for stringers, rib and spar gussets which have been modeled using one dimensional element to prove the safety against <b>fuel</b> pressure. <b>Filler</b> <b>cap</b> cut out has been modeled with actual edge distances and rivet forces are extracted for comparing with test results on a single lap bearing specimen...|$|R

The cause of the accident was fuel exhaustion. A <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> <b>cap</b> was discovered to be missing after the accident.|$|E
5000|$|West Coast Choppers {{motorcycles}} {{are described}} as old school, and minimalist. [...] WCC bikes have been called more stripped down when contrasted with decades-long established chopper builders like Arlen Ness, that is, a bike with, [...] "not much there but engine, what the law requires, and something to hold onto." [...] In spite of this characterization, a WCC trademark {{is the use of}} 9×19mm and [...]44 Magnum shell casings as purely non-functional decorations, adorning the <b>fuel</b> or oil <b>filler</b> <b>caps</b> or top of the motorcycle's handlebar risers, or elsewhere. The presence of this 20th-century gun ammunition is intended to evoke Jesse James' distant ancestor, old west outlaw and gunfighter Jesse James. [...] A strong metaphorical tie between the chopper-riding biker and old west outlaws is a mainstay of biker culture, established by [...] "the biker world's Norman Rockwell," [...] painter David Mann. [...] The biker's cross logo, a version of the Iron Cross or the Maltese Cross, is also typical of a WCC bike, though that symbol is nearly ubiquitous in Kustom Kulture regardless.|$|R
50|$|The SV-1 had a rear <b>fuel</b> <b>filler</b> {{similar to}} the early coupes. Toyota changed all Celicas to side <b>fuel</b> <b>fillers</b> in mid 1972, so all {{production}} liftbacks had <b>fuel</b> <b>fillers</b> on the left rear quarter panel with a cover flap.|$|R
