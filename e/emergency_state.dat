Newark received $32 million in <b>emergency</b> <b>state</b> aid in 2011 and 2012, requiring a memorandum of understanding between Newark and the state that obligates the city to request and the state to approve appointments to city hall administrative positions.|$|E

2500|$|At 3 am on April 5, 1994, Abigail Alling and Mark Van Thillo, {{members of}} the first crew, {{allegedly}} vandalized the project from outside, opening one double-airlock door and three single door emergency exits, leaving them open for approximately fifteen minutes. [...] Five panes of glass were also broken. [...] Alling later told the Chicago Tribune that she [...] "considered the Biosphere {{to be in an}} <b>emergency</b> <b>state...</b> In no way was it sabotage. It was my responsibility." [...] About 10% of the biosphere's air was exchanged with the outside during this time, according to systems analyst Donella Meadows, who received a communication from Ms. Alling in which she explained that she and Van Thillo judged it their ethical duty to give those inside the choice of continuing with the drastically changed human experiment or leaving, as they didn't know what the crew had been told of the new situation. “On April 1, 1994, at approximately 10 AM … limousines arrived on the biosphere site … with two investment bankers hired by Mr. Bass … They arrived with a temporary restraining order to take over direct control of the project … [...] With them were 6-8 police officers hired by the Bass organization … They immediately changed locks on the offices … All communication systems were changed (telephone and access codes), and [...] were prevented from receiving any data regarding safety, operations, and research of Biosphere 2.” Alling emphasized several times in her letter that the “bankers” who suddenly took over “knew nothing technically or scientifically, and little about the biospherian crew.” ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a {{baseline}} of information available on <b>state</b> <b>emergency</b> management Web sites. <b>State</b> <b>emergency</b> management agencies are chosen as the unit of analysis because these state agencies are the managers of multi-level government responses to disasters (Schneider, 1995). Web sites are selected because they are one of the first places the public goes to obtain information about the government (Horrigan, 2004). Through a content analysis of all 50 <b>state</b> <b>emergency</b> management Web sites, the paper examines four variables identified in the literature as important markers of effective electronic government communication: democratic outreach, information content, outreach to special needs populations, and intergovernmental relations. The results from this study provide a baseline for future research on <b>state</b> <b>emergency</b> management communication and provide insights into how <b>state</b> <b>emergency</b> management agencies can improve their Web sites...|$|R
40|$|There is the {{big issue}} in medical {{education}} which is students don’t have enough skills. Often even with theoretical knowledge graduate medical students need to improve their skills by working with patients. Obviously {{it can be a}} risk for patients and takes quite long time. This situation could be changed with applying simulation technologies in medical education. Medical education with virtual simulators allows reducing the time of skills development and improving the quality of training. The aims of this work are developing informational model and creating clinical scenarios of <b>emergency</b> <b>states</b> in the Medical Simulation Center. Objectives: – to analyze the process of scenario conducting; – to create clinical scenarios of <b>emergency</b> <b>states</b> (anaphylactic shock, hypovolemic shock, obstructive shock) with specialist’s help. The scenarios consist of sections such as main aim, skills, required mannequins, preparation of the mannequins, preparation of medical equipment and instruments for the scenario, preparation of special materials, scenario description, guide for operator, information for trainees. By analyzing the process of scenario conducting the key participants were defined who are operator, assistant, trainer, trainees. Also the main scenario stages were defined. Based on the stages diagram of variants of scenario conducting was designed. As an example there are fragments of scenario “Obstructive shock – a pulmonary embolism” in this article. Learn skills are cognitive, technical, social ones. Results. This paper presents an analysis of the clinical scenario conducting. Information model was developed which based on object-oriented decomposition. The model is the diagram of variants of scenario conducting. Scenario’s structure for <b>emergency</b> <b>states</b> was formulated. The scenarios are anaphylactic shock, hypovolemic shock, obstructive shock (pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax), pulmonary edema, hypertensive crisis, respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn, meconium aspiration syndrome. </span...|$|R
