5|$|The Ringway {{projects}} were extremely unpopular and drew wide-scale protests, {{which led to}} the cancellation of plans in 1972, particularly after the Westway had opened in the face of wide scale protest two years earlier.

In 1979, the Ministry of Transport planned to <b>improve</b> the Great Cambridge Road Roundabout with a £17 million scheme that would have demolished over 100 houses and shops. This was cancelled and replaced with a straightforward underpass in 1983, costing £22.3 million.|$|E

40|$|An <b>improved</b> active {{disturbance}} rejection controller (ADRC) {{is designed}} to eliminate the influences of the current-loop for the pitching axis control system of an aerial camera. The <b>improved</b> ADRC is composed of a tracking differentiator (TD), an <b>improved</b> extended state observer (ESO), an <b>improved</b> nonlinear state error feedback (NLSEF), and a disturbance compensation device (DCD). The TD is used to arrange transient process. The <b>improved</b> ESO is utilized to observe the state extended by nonlinear dynamics, model uncertainty, and external disturbances. Overtime variation of the current-loop can be predicted by the <b>improved</b> ESO. The <b>improved</b> NLSEF is adopted to restrain the residual errors of the current-loop. The DCD is used to compensate the overtime variation of the current-loop in real time. The <b>improved</b> ADRC is designed based on a new nonlinear function newfal(·). This function exhibits enhanced continuity and smoothness compared to previously available nonlinear functions. Thus, the new nonlinear function can effectively decrease the high-frequency flutter phenomenon. The <b>improved</b> ADRC exhibits <b>improved</b> control performance, and disturbances of the current-loop can be eliminated by the <b>improved</b> ADRC. Finally, simulation experiments are performed. Results show that the <b>improved</b> ADRC displayed better performance than the proportional integral (PI) control strategy and traditional ADRC...|$|R
