40|$|Bacterial {{infections are}} major {{complications}} after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT). They consist mainly of bloodstream infections (BSI), followed by pneumonia and gastrointestinal infections, including typhlitis and Clostridium difficile infection. Microbiological data come mostly from BSI. Coagulase negative staphylococci and Enterobacteriaceae {{are the most}} frequent pathogens causing approximately 25 % of BSI each, followed by enterococci, P. aeruginosa and viridans streptococci. Bacterial pneumonia is frequent after HSCT, and Gram-negatives are predominant. Clostridium difficile infection affects approximately 15 % of HSCT recipients, being more frequent in case of allogeneic than autologous HSCT. The epidemiology and the prevalence of resistant strains vary significantly between transplant centres. In some regions, multi-drug resistant Gram-negative rods are increasingly frequent. In others, vancomycin-resistant enterococci are predominant. In the era of an increasing resistance to antibiotics, the efficacy of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis and standard treatment of febrile neutropenia have been questioned. Therefore, thorough evaluation of local epidemiology is mandatory in order to decide the need for prophylaxis and {{the choice of the}} best regimen for empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia. For the latter, individualised approach has been proposed, consisting of either escalation or <b>de-escalation</b> <b>strategy.</b> <b>De-escalation</b> <b>strategy</b> is recommended is resistant bacteria should be covered upfront, mainly in patients with severe clinical presentation and previous infection or colonisation with a resistant pathogens. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as screening for resistant bacteria, applying isolation and contact precautions should be put in place in order to limit the spread of MDR bacteria.

We aimed to describe the long-term outcomes of patients with CD in clinical remission after infliximab treatment was withdrawn. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from the 115 patients included in the infliximab discontinuation in patients with CD in stable remission on combined therapy with anti-metabolites (STORI) study, performed at 20 centers in France and Belgium from March 2006 through December 2009. The STORI cohort was a prospective analysis of risk and factors associated with relapse following withdrawal of maintenance therapy with infliximab, maintained on anti-metabolites, while in clinical remission. We collected data {{from the end of}} the study until the last available follow-up examination on patient surgeries, new complex perianal lesions (indicating major complications), and need for and outcomes of restarting therapy with infliximab or another biologic agent. The <b>de-escalation</b> <b>strategy</b> was considered to have failed when a major complication or infliximab restart failure occurred. RESULTS: Of the 115 patients initially included, data from 102 patients (from 19 of the 20 study centres) were included in the final analysis. The median follow-up time was 7 years, Twenty-one percent of the patients did not restart treatment with infliximab or another biologic agent and did not have a major complication 7 years after infliximab withdrawal (95 % CI, 13. 1 - 30. 3). Among patients who restarted infliximab, treatment failed for 30. 1 % 6 years after restarting (95 % CI, 18. 5 - 42. 5). Overall, at 7 years after stopping infliximab therapy, major complications occurred in 18. 5 % of patients (95 % CI, 10. 2 - 26. 8) whereas 70. 2 % of patients had no failure of the <b>de-escalation</b> <b>strategy</b> (95 % CI, 60. 2 - 80. 1). Factors independently associated with major complications were upper-gastrointestinal location of disease, white blood cell count >/= 5. 0 x 109 /l, and hemoglobin level </= 12. 5 g/dl at the time of infliximab withdrawal. Patients with at least 2 of these factors had a more than 40 % risk of major complication in the 7 years following infliximab withdrawal. CONCLUSION: In a long-term follow-up of the STORI cohort (7 years) one fifth of the patients did not restart infliximab or another biologic agent and did not develop major complications. Seventy percent of patients had no failure of the <b>de-escalation</b> <b>strategy</b> (no major complication and no failure of infliximab restart). Peer reviewe...|$|E

30|$|A {{cross-sectional}} multicenter {{study showed}} that antifungal treatment was administered to 7.5 % of ICU patients, although two-thirds of them had no documented invasive candidiasis [14]. In addition, recent studies suggested no benefit of empirical antifungal treatment in these patients [21, 22]. Reducing antifungal use in the ICU with an antifungal stewardship is feasible and would allow avoiding drawbacks. The European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend a <b>de-escalation</b> <b>strategy</b> (5  days in stabilized patients for the IDSA and 10  days overall for the ESCMID) [13, 23], but the level of recommendations is low.

However, some limitations, such as non-comparative or post hoc design, preclude definite conclusions. Therefore, we hypothesized that de-escalation of antifungal treatment might be safe in patients with suspected invasive Candida infection and conducted this retrospective study to identify the incidence and associated factors, and to assess safety of antifungal treatment de-escalation in ICU patients.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} role {{of active}} methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) surveillance {{in the intensive}} care unit (ICU), has been recently proposed as a guide for antibiotic treatment in patients suspected of being infected with MRSA by using an antibiotic care bundle (ACB) approach. A group of 376 consecutive ICU patients were prospectively screened for nasal carriage of MRSA using a real-time polymerase chain reaction test. The study group consisted of 244 (64. 9 %) males and (35. 1 %) females, with a median age of 64 (range 17 - 95 years). Overall, 26 (6. 9 %) patients were positive for MRSA, while 350 (93. 1 %) were MRSA-negative. No difference was observed in gender and age between groups. During ICU stay, 9 (2. 4 %) patients developed generalized MRSA infection, of whom 8 out of 26 (30. 8 %) were MRSA-carriers and one out of the 350 (0. 3 %) was MRSA-negative. Thus, a strong relationship between MRSA infection and MRSA carriage (relative risk= 107. 7, 95 % confidence interval= 14. 0 - 828. 5, p< 0. 0001) was found. Subsequently, in our ICU, we developed and introduced a new ACB approach based on rapid nasal screening results for improving the management of critically ill patients. The use of anti-MRSA agents should be re-evaluated daily on the basis of clinical and laboratory features, with positive cultures from sterile site or signs of active infection supporting prolongation of empirical treatment. On the contrary, MRSA-negative clinical cultures support a <b>de-escalation</b> <b>strategy.</b> In conclusion, the early identification of MRSA-carriers using a rapid molecular screening is safe and accurate, allowing MRSA-positive patients, who will more likely develop MRSA infections, to be detected...|$|E

However, {{it is still}} controversial and here we will analyze the efficacy and safety of MT with darunavir with ritonavir (DRV/r) on patients who have received this treatment in our hospitals. Materials and Methods: Observational retrospective study that includes patients from 10 Andalusian hospitals that have received DRV/r in MT and {{that have been followed}} over a minimum of 12 months. We carried out a statistical descriptive analysis based on the profile of patients who had been prescribed MT and the efficacy and safety that were observed, paying special attention to treatment failure and virological evolution. Results: DRV/r was prescribed to 604 patients, of which 41. 1 % had a CD 4 nadir 200 c/mL and 3. 6 % additional losses due to VF with VL between 50 and 200 copies/mL. Thirty three genotypes were performed after failure without findings of resistance mutations to DRV/r or other IPs. Only 23. 7 % of patients presented some blips during the period of exposition to MT. Eighty seven percent of all determinations of VL had 200 copies/mL. Although up to 14. 9 % registered at some point an AE, only 2. 6 % abandoned MT because of AE and 1. 2 % because of voluntary decision. Although the average of total and LDL cholesterol increases 10 mg/dL after 2 years of follow-up, so did HDL cholesterol in 3 mg/dL and the values of triglycerides (− 14 mg/dL) and GPT (− 6 UI/mL) decreased.

Consequently, guidelines for treating systemic Candida infection (SCI) recommend a “de-escalation” strategy: initial broad-spectrum antifungal agents (e. g., echinocandins), followed by switching to fluconazole if isolates are fluconazole sensitive, rather than “escalation” with initial fluconazole treatment and then switching to echinocandins if isolates are fluconazole resistant. However, fluconazole {{may continue to}} be used as first-line treatment in view of its low acquisition costs. The aim of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the budget impact of the <b>de-escalation</b> <b>strategy</b> using micafungin compared with the escalation strategy in France and Germany. Methods: A budget impact model was used to compare de-escalation to escalation strategies. As well as survival, clinical success (resolution/reduction of symptoms and radiographic abnormalities associated with fungal infection), was considered, as was mycological success (eradication of Candida from the bloodstream). Health economic outcomes included cost per health state according to clinical success and mycological success, and budget impact. A 42 -day time horizon was used. Results: For all patients with SCI, the budget impact of using de-escalation rather than escalation was greater, but improved rates of survival, clinical success and mycological success were apparent with de-escalation. In patients with fluconazole-resistant isolates, clinical success rates and survival were improved by ~ 72 % with de-escalation versus escalation, producing cost savings of € 6, 374 and € 356 per patient in France and Germany, respectively; improvements of ~ 72 % in mycological success rates with de-escalation versus escalation did not translate into cost savings. Conclusion: Modeling provides evidence that when treating SCI in individuals at risk of azole-resistant infections, de-escalation from micafungin has potential cost savings associated with improved clinical success rates.

There were relapses of agitation which required further sedation. No clinical trials have reported on the safety of IV olanzapine for the management of acute agitation specifically in the ED. Conclusion: There is little evidence of efficacy or safety to support the use of IV olanzapine in the ED. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Community {{partnerships}} {{that are}} formed through Community Oriented Policing help to assist {{law enforcement officers}} with academy education and post academy education. The training offered in the academy and the post academy Field Training Officer Program traditionally places little to no emphasis on critical thinking, professional self-regulation, communication skills or problem-based learning. In {{the last several years}} a new approach has been spawned. The Police Training Officer Program (PTO) is an innovative form of education that focuses on problem based learning for post academy graduates. The PTO Program emphasizes adult education, problem solving, emotional intelligence, and conflict resolution. This education is necessary to assist officers in <b>de-escalation</b> <b>strategies</b> within their communities and can lend to the reduction of civil disturbances. However, currently, relatively few agencies are offering this education to their post academy graduates and none are offering it to their academy recruits due, in part, to a lack of qualified instructors. PTO instructors must be proficient and fully trained in problem based learning techniques. Through Community Oriented Policing, law enforcement agencies can address this instructor shortage by partnering with university educational institutions to secure instructors who are competent in andragogy, critical thinking, and problem-based learning. </p...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the safety and feasibility of antibiotic de-escalation in patients admitted with bacteremic pneumonia. Methods: A retrospective chart review was done for patients with bacteremic pneumonia admitted to Northwest Texas Hospital in Amarillo, TX, USA, during 2008. Antibiotic de-escalation was defined as changing the empiric antibiotic regimen to a culture-directed single agent with a narrower spectrum than the original regimen. Results: Sixty-eight patients were admitted with bacteremic pneumonia. Eight patients were not eligible for de-escalation. Among the 60 patients who were eligible for de-escalation, the treating physicians failed to de-escalate antibiotics in 27 cases (45. 0 %). Discharge to a long-term care facility predicted failure to de-escalate antibiotics, while an infectious diseases consultation was significantly associated with antibiotic de-escalation. The average daily cost of antibacterial therapy in the de-escalation group was $ 25. 7 compared with $ 61. 6 in the group where de-escalation was not implemented. The difference in mean length of hospital stay and mortality between the two groups was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Antibiotic de-escalation is a safe management strategy but unfortunately is not widely adopted. Although bacterial resistance poses a significant threat and is rising, antimicrobial de-escalation has emerged as a potential intervention that can conserve the effectiveness of broad-spectrum antibiotics without compromising the patient&# 39;s outcome. This practice is becoming important in the face of slow development of new anti-infective agents. Keywords: bacteremia, antibiotic <b>de-escalation</b> <b>strategy,</b> lung infectio...|$|E
40|$|According {{to several}} surveys and observations, the {{percentage}} of successfully conducted IT projects without over-budgeting and delays in time schedule are extremely low. Many projects also are evaluated as failures in terms of delivered functionality. Nuldén (1996) compares IT projects with bad movies; after watching for 2 hours, one still tries to finish it even though one understands {{that it is a}} complete waste of time. The argument for that is 'I've already invested too much time to terminate it now'. The same happens with IT projects: sometimes the company continues wasting money on these projects for a long time, even though there are no expected benefits from these projects. Eventually these projects are terminated anyway, but until this moment, the company spends a lot. The situation described above is a consequence of “escalation of commitment” - project continuation even after a manager receives negative feedback of the project’s success probability. According to Keil and Mähring (2010), even though escalation can occur in any type of project, it is more common among complex technological projects, such as IT projects. Escalation of commitment very often results in runaway projects. In order to avoid it, managers use de-escalation strategies, which allow the resources to be used in more effective. These strategies lead to project termination or turning around, which stops the flow of wasted investments. Numbers of researches explore escalation of commitment phenomena based on experiments and business cases. Moreover, during the last decade several frameworks were proposed for <b>de-escalation</b> <b>strategy.</b> However, {{there is no evidence of}} successful implementation of the de-escalation of commitment strategy in the literature. In addition, despite that fact that IT project management methodologies are widely used in the companies, none of them cover the topic of escalation of commitment risks. At the same time, there are no researches proposing the way to implement de-escalation of commitment strategy into the existing project management methodology The research is focused on a single case of large ERP implementation project by the consulting company. Hence, the main deliverables of the study include suggestions of improvement in de-escalation methods and techniques in the project and in the company.

40|$|Purpose of the study: There {{is still}} an open {{question}} how to start antiretro-viral therapy (ART). This retrospective study shows results of a <b>de-escalation</b> <b>strategy</b> starting with a protease inhibitor (PI), followed by a nevirapine-based regimen {{over a period of}} five years. Methods: All patients were ART-na&#x 00 EF;ve and received PI in combination with two NRTIs. The PI was changed to nevirapine, when viral load (VL) stayed at least 12 months below the detection limit (50 or 40 copies/ml plasma). The median time to negative VL was measured. CD 4, VL and liver tests were followed in 82 patients over at least 5 years before ART, during PI phase and over a median of 48 months after change to nevirapine. Resistance tests were performed - if possible - in patients before initiating ART. Summary of results: 20 female and 62 male patients were treated for an average of 28 months with PI (43 &#x 00 D 7;lopinavir, 5 &#x 00 D 7;indinavir, 6 &#x 00 D 7;invirase/r and 3 &#x 00 D 7;fortovase/r, 8 &#x 00 D 7;nelfinavir, 14 &#x 00 D 7;atazanavir/r, 3 &#x 00 D 7;norvir-mono plus two backbone NRTI in various combinations). There were 2 cases of hepatitis B and 5 HCV positives in the cohort. The mean CD 4 before starting ART was 246 /&#x 00 B 5;l and the average VL was 421, 038 copies/ml plasma (ranging from 1, 050 &#x 2013; 9, 000, 000 copies/ml plasma). The median time to negative VL was 188 days. CD 4 cells were rising by 364 /&#x 00 B 5;l during PI treatment to 610 /&#x 00 B 5;l. This was followed by a steady increase of another 70 cells/&#x 00 B 5;l during the first year after changing to nevirapine. The median follow up after de-escalation to nevirapine was 48 months. Although the median CD 4 was above 400 /&#x 00 B 5;l in all patients when changed to nevirapine, no severe liver toxicity was seen in the cohort. Change to NNRTI was safe in the group of 20 women with CD 4 cells above 400 /&#x 00 B 5;l. Allergic skin reactions where seen in 7 out of 82 patients during the first 3 months after changing to nevirapine. No events of resistancies were seen in the group of 82 patients before and under treatment. Conclusions: Long-term durability of nevirapine containing ART regimens following an induction phase with PIs is very high. No risk of treatment failure by resistance mutations was seen in a follow up of more than 48 months. Liver toxicity was not seen when ART was changed to nevirapine neither in female nor in male patients. The study was supported by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{use of force}} by police officers has {{captured the attention of}} society. Allegations of inappropriate or misapplied force happen with regularity. This thesis conducted a survey {{of the members of the}} International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training to determine the number of training hours dedicated to firearms and force versus de-escalation topics. It analyzes the results through the framework of the Recognition-Primed Decision model, which asserts that in rapidly evolving, time-limited incidents, individuals make decisions based on prior experiences. This thesis hypothesizes that officers are primed to use force rather than de-escalation options due to an overemphasis on force during training sessions. The survey results showed an 8. 9 to 1 ratio of training hours on force versus de-escalation. It recommends that police trainers strive to achieve parity in training hours dedicated to force and de-escalation topics. It also recommends that scenario-based training be emphasized to provide experiences to draw upon, and that the scenarios mirror real-world probabilities. Positioning Theory, Crisis Intervention Team principles, and <b>de-escalation</b> <b>strategies</b> of other countries are also examined for methods that could be implemented to reduce the occurrences of inappropriate use of force by police officers.

40|$|This essay {{analyzes}} cultural {{conflicts in}} Asia with particular emphasize on Southeast Asia. Cultural conflict {{is defined as}} those domestic, inter-state or transnational politi-cal conflicts in which the actors involved focus on issues relating to religion, language and/or historicity. The statistical analysis and the assessment of individual cases in this paper substantiate a number of conclusions. First, by global comparison, Asia is a region particularly prone to conflicts. Second, domestic conflicts about identity and especially historicitary conflicts, predominate in the region. Third, the landscape of conflict in Asia is characterized by pronounced domestic conflicts of low intensities over identity. Fourth, conflicts in Asia are shaped by the dominance of "ethnic " actors. In recent decades the relevance of left-wing actors has declined, whereas the impor-tance of religiously defined actors has increased. Fifth, compared {{with the rest of}} Asia, Southeast Asia is subject to a disproportionally large number of cultural con-flicts. At the same time, however, {{it is important to note}} that in Southeast Asia there is no trend of further culturalization of conflicts in recent years. Rather, the identity conflicts in Southeast Asia seem to be very profound and as such are frequently quite resistant to <b>de-escalation</b> <b>strategies.</b> However, cultural conflicts in the region are almost exclusively of an internal nature and do not extend to inter-state relations...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTMortality {{from severe}} {{bacterial}} sepsis remains high. The pathogenesis involves production of pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines which mediate: neutrophil adhesion to the endothelium, diffuse capillary leak, disseminated intravascular coagulation, vasodilatation and mitochondrial dysfunction, {{all of which}} culminate in microcirculatory failure. Therapy is multifaceted. As described in ‘the surviving sepsis guidelines’, many therapeutic interventions, such as early goal-directed resuscitation, low dose intravenous steroids, strict glucose control, recombinant activated protein C and ventilation according to ARDS- net criteria are critical to survival. However appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy initiated early is pivotal. Empiric therapy should be designed {{with regard to the}} bacterial epidemiology within the unit and the aim should be to optimise outcome while yet attempting to reduce the potential for resistance development. Antibiotic therapy for resistant organisms consists of the carbapenems, including ertapenem for ESBL's, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam and, on occasion, the Gram-negative quinolones, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin. Consideration should be given to the possibility of ‘collateral damage’, where overuse of an antibiotic predisposes to multi-drug resistance. Antibiotics should be limited, where possible, to those organisms that are pathogens and not colonisers and should be discontinued if sepsis is not confirmed or there is rapid resolution of clinical indicators of sepsis. <b>De-escalation</b> <b>strategies</b> should be consistently employed and the duration of therapy should be tailored to clinical response. Continuation beyond 8 days is generally detrimental in terms of the potential for superinfection with resistant organisms. Failure of response necessitates, initially, a re-evaluation of source control and obsessive culturing of likely sites of sepsis prior to random antibiotic changes...|$|R
40|$|Interpersonal style, a key {{component}} of personality and personality disorder, has emerged as an important characteristic that is relevant to aggressive behavior by patients in psychiatric hospitals. However, studies examining the relationship between interpersonal style and aggression have thus far only been conducted with patients with personality disorder and/or mild and stable symptoms of mental illness. This study explored the relative importance of patients' interpersonal style, psychiatric symptoms, and perceptions of staff coercion on aggression and self-harm during acute psychiatric hospitalization. One hundred and fifty-two patients (M = 38. 32 years, SD = 12. 06; 56. 8 % males and 43. 2 % females) admitted for short-term assessment and treatment to the acute units of a civil and a forensic psychiatric hospital were administered the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Impact Message Inventory, and MacArthur Admission Experience Survey. Participants' files were reviewed and nursing staff were interviewed {{at the end of each}} patient's hospital stay to determine whether participants had self-harmed or acted aggressively towards others. Initial univariate analyses showed that thought disorder and dominant and hostile-dominant interpersonal styles predicted aggression. Using multiple regression and controlling for gender and age, only a hostile-dominant interpersonal style predicted aggression (&# 0946; =. 258, p <. 05). No factors were significantly related to self-harm. These results suggest that measures of interpersonal style are sensitive to those aspects of interpersonal functioning that are critical to patient's responses to the demands of psychiatric in-patient treatment. Procedures to assess risk and engage and manage potentially aggressive patients, including limit-setting styles and <b>de-escalation</b> <b>strategies,</b> should take into account the interpersonal style of patients and the interpersonal behavior of staff...|$|R
40|$|De-{{escalation}} and escalation therapeutic {{strategies are}} commonly employed by clinicians {{on the basis}} of susceptibility results and patient response. Since no in vitro or in vivo data are currently available to support one strategy over the other for daptomycin, we attempted to evaluate the effects of dose escalation and de-escalation on daptomycin activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates using an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model with simulated endocardial vegetations. Three clinical MRSA isolates, including one heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA) isolate and one vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) isolate, were exposed to daptomycin at 10 or 6 mg/kg of body weight/day for 8 days using a starting inoculum of ∼ 109 CFU/g of vegetations, with dose escalation and de-escalation initiated on the fourth day. Daptomycin MIC values ranged from 0. 5 to 1 μg/ml. In the PK/PD model, high-dose daptomycin (10 mg/kg/day) and de-escalation simulation (10 to 6 mg/kg/day) appeared to be the most efficient regimens against the three tested isolates, exhibiting the fastest bactericidal activity (4 to 8 h) compared to that of the standard regimen of 6 mg/kg/day and the escalation therapy of 6 to 10 mg/kg/day. The differences in the numbers of CFU/g observed between dose escalation and de-escalation were significant for the hVISA strain, with the de-escalation simulation exhibiting a better killing effect than the escalation simulation (P < 0. 024). Although our results need to be carefully considered, the use of high-dose daptomycin up front demonstrated the most efficient activity against the tested isolates. Different therapeutic scenarios including isolates with higher MICs and prolonged drug exposures are warranted to better understand the outcomes of escalation and <b>de-escalation</b> <b>strategies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Enhancing {{quality of}} life for people with {{dementia}} is identified in Healthy People 2020 as a public health priority. In Idaho, the proportion of individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is projected to increase by 81 % - 127 % between 2000 and 2025. Policies designed to address needs of this population must be based on an understanding of system wide impacts of disease. The purpose of this exploratory {{study was to examine the}} impact of behavioral crises related to dementia on first responders. For the purpose of this study, “first responders” were defined as individuals employed by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Mobile Crisis Unit in Regions 1, 3, and 4, Ada County Paramedics/EMS, and social workers employed in health care settings in the Treasure Valley. A mixed methods design was used with information gathered from incident reports from the Ada County Paramedics and focus groups and interviews with key informants. Ada County Paramedics/EMS receives approximately 22, 000 calls annually with 924 of calls related to behavioral crisis involving individuals with ADRD. Most calls were from assisted living facilities (n= 401), home (n= 290), or skilled nursing facilities (n= 181). The majority (80 %) of calls resulted in transport to a hospital emergency department (ED); none of the calls required use of lights or siren. Annual costs of calls to EMS and ED were estimated to be $ 457, 380 and $ 905, 020, respectively.

At a Sydney hospital, an Aggression Response Team (ART) comprising clinical and security staff can be alerted when a staff member has safety concerns. Our aims were to describe the patient population referred for ART calls, reasons for and interventions during ART calls, and complications following them. Methods: Patients 65 years and older referred for ART calls in the emergency department or wards during 2014 were identified using the Incident Information Management System database and medical records were reviewed. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Results: Of 43 elderly patients with ART calls, 30 had repeat ART calls. Thirty-one patients (72 %) had underlying dementia, and 22 (51 %) were agitated {{at the time of}} admission. The main reasons for ART calls were wandering and physical aggression. Pharmacological sedation was used in 88 % of the ART calls, with a range of psychotropics, doses, and routes of administration, including intravenous (19 %) and, most commonly, midazolam (53 %). Complications were documented in 14 % of cases where sedation was used. Conclusion: We observed a high frequency of pharmacological sedation among the severely agitated elderly, with significant variance in the choice and dose of sedation and a high rate of complications arising from sedation, which may be an underestimate given the lack of post-sedation monitoring.

40|$|Introduction: An {{online survey}} was {{conducted}} to characterize current infection management practices in Italian intensive care units (ICUs), including the antibacterial and antifungal drug regimens prescribed for various types of infections. Methods: During February and March 2011, all 450 ICUs in public hospitals in Italy were invited {{to take part in}} an online survey. The questionnaire focused on ICU characteristics, methods used to prevent, diagnose, and treat infections, and antimicrobials prescribing policies. The frequency of each reported practice was calculated {{as a percentage of the}} total number of units answering the question. The overall response rate to the questionnaire was 38. 8 % (175 of the 450 ICUs contacted) with homogeneous distribution across the country and in terms of unit type. Results: Eighty-eight percent of the responding facilities performed periodical surveillance cultures on all patients. In 71 % of patients, cultures were also collected on admission. Endotracheal/bronchial aspirates were the most frequently cultured specimens at both time points. Two-thirds of the responding units had never performed screening cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Around 67 % of the ICUs reported the use of antimicrobial <b>de-escalation</b> <b>strategies</b> during the treatment phase. In general, the use of empirical antimicrobial drug regimens was appropriate. Although the rationale for the choice was not always clearly documented, the use of a combination therapy was preferred over antibiotic monotherapy. The preferred first-line agents for invasive candidiasis were fluconazole and an echinocandin (64 % and 25 %, respectively). Two-thirds of the ICUs monitored vancomycin serum levels and administered it by continuous infusion in 86 % of cases. For certain antibiotics, reported doses were too low to ensure effective treatment of severe infections in critically ill patients; conversely, inappropriately high doses were administered for certain antifungal drugs. Conclusions: Although infection control policies and management practices are generally appropriate in Italian ICUs, certain aspects, such as the extensive use of multidrug empirical regimens and the inappropriate antimicrobial dosing, deserve careful management and closer investigatio...|$|R
40|$|Background: HER 2 -targeted therapy plus {{chemotherapy}} {{is standard}} treatment in advanced HER 2 + breast cancer. Trastuzumab alone followed by addition of chemotherapy at disease progression versus upfront combination therapy {{has not been}} elucidated. Patients and methodsOne-hundred-seventy-five patients with measurable/evaluable HER 2 + advanced disease without previous HER 2 -directed therapy were randomized to trastuzumab alone followed, at disease progression, by the combination with chemotherapy (Arm A) or upfront trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (Arm B). Chemotherapy could be stopped after ≥ 6 cycles in responding patients, trastuzumab was continued until progression. The primary endpoint of this superiority trial was time to progression (TTP) on combined trastuzumabchemotherapy (Combination-TTP) in both arms. Secondary endpoints included response rate, TTP, overall survival, {{quality of life and}} toxicity. ResultsCombination-TTP was longer than expected in both arms, 12. 2 months in Arm A and 10. 3 months in Arm B and not significantly different (hazard ratio [HR] 0. 7; 95 % CI 0. 5 - 1. 1; P = 0. 1). Overall survival was also not significantly different (HR 0. 9; 95 % CI 0. 6 - 1. 5; P= 0. 55). In Arm A, the median TTP before introduction of chemotherapy was 3. 7 months (95 % CI 2. 3 - 5. 4), yet at two years 6 % of patients were still on trastuzumab alone. Patients without visceral disease had a Combination-TTP of 21. 8 months in arm A, compared with 10. 1 months in arm B (unplanned analysis HR 2. 1, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 4. 2, p= 0. 03). Patients with visceral disease showed no difference. Toxicity was chemotherapy-related. ConclusionThe outcome of patients receiving sequential trastuzumab-chemotherapy or upfront combination was similar. We failed to demonstrate superiority of the sequential approach. These results nevertheless suggest chemotherapy and its toxicity can be deferred, especially in patients with indolent, non-visceral disease. Despite a larger non-inferiority confirmatory study would be needed, these findings represent an additional proof of concept that <b>de-escalation</b> <b>strategies</b> can be discussed in individual patients...|$|R
