Lyell begins {{by noting that}} Lamarck gives no examples {{at all of the}} development of any entirely new function ("the substitution of some entirely new sense, faculty, or organ") but only proves that the [...] "dimensions and strength" [...] of some parts can be increased or decreased. Lyell says that with this [...] "disregard to the strict rules of induction" [...] Lamarck [...] "resorts to fictions". Lyell goes on, assuming <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>argument</b> that Lamarck was right about the creation of new organs, that Lamarck's theory would mean that instead of the nature and form of an animal giving rise to its behaviour, its behaviour would determine ...|$|E

2500|$|... "A Defense of Abortion" [...] {{is a moral}} {{philosophy}} paper by Judith Jarvis Thomson first published in 1971. Granting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>argument</b> that the fetus {{has a right to}} life, Thomson uses thought experiments to argue that the fetus's right to life does not trump the pregnant woman's right to control her own body and its life-support functions, and that induced abortion is therefore not morally impermissible. Her argument has many critics {{on both sides of the}} abortion debate, yet continues to receive defense. [...] Thomson's imaginative examples and controversial conclusions have made [...] "A Defense of Abortion" [...] perhaps [...] "the most widely reprinted essay in all of contemporary philosophy".|$|E
2500|$|In his simple model, Marx straightforwardly equated – <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>argument</b> – {{the total}} cost-price {{of the new}} output with the total {{production}} capital advanced, abstracting from many intervening variables such as capital depreciation and turnovers. Marx furthermore assumed, that {{at the point where}} a new output had been produced, its cost-price (a sum of money-capital representing materials costs, wage costs and operating costs) was a given, unchangeable datum, and he considered that price-value discrepancies of inputs bought were irrelevant to his analysis, since it was the value of this new output (and not the value of capital advanced) that was being related to a general price level and a general profitability level in the markets where the output was sold.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{orthodox}} classical revolutionary Marxism, profits {{can only}} arise from surplus labor, and therefore, {{it is argued}} that the direct source of all capitalist profits is the exploitation of wage labor. This principle is often called the [...] "Fundamental Marxist Theorem" [...] by mathematical Marxists: a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of positive profits is that surplus value is positive. It is an interpretation which certainly makes sense {{from the point of view}} of Capital, Volume I where Marx assumed, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sake</b> <b>of</b> <b>argument</b> and for the sake of simplicity, that the prices at which the inputs and outputs of capitalist production are traded are equal to their value. In Capital, Volume I, Marx aimed to show, that even if all commodities were fairly traded on the basis of equal exchange, exploitation could nevertheless occur within capitalist production, and that if more value did not come out of production than went into it, it would be impossible to explain economic growth. The reason was simply that workers together could produce much more value than they needed themselves to live. That was, according to Marx, exactly the reason why the owners of capital hired those workers.|$|E
