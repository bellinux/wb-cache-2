40|$|As web {{applications}} evolves, their structure {{may become}} more and more complex. Thus, systematic approaches/methods for web application testing are needed. Existing methods take into consideration only those actions/events the user is prompted by the application itself, such as the selection of a <b>hypertextual</b> <b>link</b> or the submission of the data contained in a form. However, these methods do not consider also actions/events provided by the browser, such as the usage of backward and forward buttons, usage that in some cases may produce navigation inconsistencies...|$|E

This question addresses the particular relation that may {{exist between the}} discursive doma ins of film and hypertext {{in terms of a}} possible affinity between the c inematic edit and the <b>hypertextual</b> <b>link,</b> with a view to reimagining the genealogy char has been imposed upon hypertext as a reading and writing practice. It is hoped that along the way a productive recasting of the relation between c inema theory (of one sort or another) and hypertext can occur, and that chis will provide a possible methodology for a hypertext writing practice that is yet to be invented...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} random Web crawl model. A Web crawl is a (biased and partial) {{image of the}} Web. This paper deals with the {{hyperlink}} structure, i. e. a Web crawl is a graph, whose vertices are the pages and whose edges are the <b>hypertextual</b> <b>links.</b> Of course a Web crawl has a very special structure; we recall some known results about it. We then propose a model generating similar structures. Our model simply simulates a crawling, i. e. builds and crawls the graph at the same time. The graphs generated have lot of known properties of Web crawls. Our model is simpler than most random Web graph models, but captures the same properties. Notice that it models the crawling process instead of the page writing process of Web graph models...|$|R
40|$|The essay {{describes}} {{the use of}} George P. Landow's hypertext, The Dickens Web, in an advanced undergraduate literature class and analyzes its practical and theoretical implications. Hypertext is shown to encourage active student engagement, especially with contextual material; to lead to more focused research topics; and to facilitate student collaboration. Some of Landow's claims about he ease with which this occurs, however, are questioned. The difficulty of teaching students how to follow and construct conceptual <b>hypertextual</b> <b>links</b> is examined, and the instructor's role in relation to student contributions tothe Web is presented as much more problematic than Landow allows. George P. Landow is arguably academe's most enthusi-astic literary proponent of hypertext and hypermedia. In a series of books and articles he has both expli-cated hypertext's theoretical dimensions and extolled its pedagogical potential. As teaching tools, hypertext and hypermedia create astudent-centered environment in which students become active participants in the construction ofknowledge. Two hypertext"webs " that Landow has developed to exploit his potential in hi...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:	This paper {{studies the}} Spanish {{translations}} of the Italian word "tondo", that enters the Spanish {{language as a}} loan of the Italian architectural jargon. However, in Italian "tondo" is also used {{in the language of}} painting, as examined in the famous work of Miguel Angel Tondo Doni. The study of the term "tondo" exemplifies the methodology used in the interuniversity project Lessico dei Beni Culturali (LBC) of the Dipartimento di Lingue, Letterature e Studi Multiculturali of the University of Florence, whose purpose is to create monolingual and bilingual related dictionaries through <b>hypertextual</b> <b>links</b> in order to help translators which have art as subject matter to understand them and to choose the appropriate terms in the target language according to the context and to the varied typologies of discourse of the tourist guides, Museum web pages or exhibition catalogues. For each word studied, a source file is written in Italian and in every project language (German, English, Chinese, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Russian) from both a diachronic and a synchronic perspective, on the basis of specialized texts and dictionaries. The two perspectives are necessary to understand the concepts underlying the denominations in the source language, which is generally characterized by a high degree of semantic variation...|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{websites}} do {{not only}} have to catch the attention of the web surfer, who in the end can also become a potential customer, they are also engaged in the crucial task of guiding the reader through the complex maze of semiotic systems which constitutes a web page. Successful sites are those giving the reader assistance {{to be able to find}} the relevant information he or she is seeking. Although we assume that this navigation aid is not exclusively verbal, the aim of thispaper is to analyse some of the linguistic means by which this navigation is assisted and, more particularly, to explore the presence of textual metadiscourse. After giving a definition of the concept of metadiscourse, we explore the insights that can be gained from the field of usability, within the area of Computer-Human Interaction, which will help us to detect more clearly metadiscursive devices present in commercial websites. Then we categorize the different typesof textual metadiscourse and try to find some distinctive features of their presence in digital metadiscourse. Finally, we extend the classification to a group of devices which is restricted to digital discourse, <b>hypertextual</b> <b>links</b> or nodes. In so far as they help readers to navigate through digital documents, links play an outstanding role in commercial websites and can be classified according to the metadiscoursive function they carry out...|$|R
40|$|Use of the World Wide Web in {{academic}} libraries has grown exponentially since the mid- 1990 s {{and the introduction}} of easy-to-use browser software such as Mosaic and Netscape. In academic settings, librarians, faculty, and enterprising computer science or engineering students {{were among the first to}} recognize and to make use of the potential of this new publishing medium. Early pioneers saw the Web as a unique space in which to organize through <b>hypertextual</b> <b>links</b> various Internet resources. Besides organizing existing material, new information sources could easily be created, mounted on a server, and accessed by others. A solid Latino presence was quickly established on the Web in the form of librarian Richard Chabnin 2 ̆ 7 s scholarly CLNet, then at UCLA, and in the irrepressible Ego Web, constructed by Felipe Campos 207 at the University of Texas, Austin. 1 It is odd to look back at that time-not that long ago-and recall the marvel and excitement of waiting for Mosaic to load the CLNet home page onscreen. Since those early days, numerous other Latino Web resources and hypertext lists have been developed, but in many ways, these two pioneering sites still represent the opposite poles ofWeb site developmentthose sites developed by subject and content specialists, and those developed by amateur enthusiasts. For Latino resources, there is value in both approaches...|$|R
40|$|Mention {{indicators}} {{have frequently}} {{been used in}} Webometric studies because they provide {{a powerful tool for}} determining the degree of visibility and impact of web resources. Among mention indicators, <b>hypertextual</b> <b>links</b> were a central part of many studies until Yahoo discontinued the linkdomain command in 2011. Selective links constitute a variant of external links where both the source and target of the link can be selected. This paper intends to study the influence of social platforms (measured through the number of selective external links) on academic environments, in order to ascertain both the percentage that they constitute and whether some of them can be used as substitutes of total external links. For this purpose, 141 URLs belonging to 76 Spanish universities were compiled in 2010 (before Yahoo! stopped their link services), and the number of links from 13 selected social platforms to these universities were calculated. Results confirm a good correlation between total external links and links that come from social platforms, with the exception of some applications (such as Digg and Technorati). For those universities with a higher number of total external links, the high correlation is only maintained on Delicious and Wikipedia, which can be utilized as substitutes of total external links in the context analyzed. Notwithstanding, the global percentage of links from social platforms constitute {{only a small fraction of}} total links, although a positive trend is detected, especially in services such as Twitter, Youtube, and Facebook...|$|R
5000|$|Elfland Catacombs {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} examples of hypertext fiction [...] It was published by Winterhearth company in 1981, several years before Michael Joyce's Afternoon, a story (which is generally thought to be [...] "the first hypertext fiction"). Author Alan Lance Andersen created Elfland Catacombs as a children's fantasy adventure, using the Commodore BASIC computer language. The plot involved the reader visiting an aunt in the border country of Scotland and becoming lost after crossing into Elfland {{with the help of an}} elf named Jennings. Numerous plot paths led to different endings — some happy and others not quite so pleasant. Unlike the many computer game style adventures of the period, this was a true electronic storybook with <b>hypertextual</b> <b>links.</b> Paul Jordan Hollander later converted it from the obsolete Commodore Basic into HTML files. Whatever its literary or technological merits may have been, [...] "Elfland Catacombs" [...] had little or no influence on the development of hypertext fiction. It was distributed on 5" [...] floppy disk in Central Iowa; indeed, it appears to have been almost entirely forgotten outside of Iowa. It is not mentioned in Bolter and Joyce's seminal Hypertext 87 essay on [...] "Hypertext and Creative Writing", nor in Ted Nelson's _Literary Machines_, George P. Landow's _Hypertext: The Convergence of Contemporary Literary Criticism and Technology_, nor in J. Yellowlees' Douglas 1991 doctoral dissertaion on hypertext fiction [...] It has never been cited in the Proceedings of the ACM Hypertext Conference. In contrast, Joyce's Afternoon, a story has been the subject of numerous reviews, essays, studies, and dissertations.|$|R
40|$|While the {{digitization}} {{of books}} offers great values by facilitating access, the careful {{design of the}} access-software can greatly enhance {{the value of a}} digital library. The access-software of many digital libraries just mimics the behavior of printed editions. Using the new features that the Web 2. 0 (collaboration, AJAX, DHTML, dynamic web-pages, javascript etc.) and the multimedia-based characteristics of <b>hypertextual</b> <b>linking</b> offers, the access-software can be enhanced to a full-fledged research tool that goes way beyond just displaying digitized pages of text. Within the research project "Incunabula Basilea: Late-medieval doctrine as image and text reading", an interdisciplinary research project by the imaging & media lab and the Department of Art History of the University of Basel, such a enhanced web-application will be developed (An incunabulum is a book, single sheet, or image that was printed - not handwritten - before the year 1501 AD). The web-application will implement an expert's Wiki-concept which allows to interconnect books, pages, parts of pages, images and image-regions with rich, commented links. When populated, this web of links allows an in-depth analysis the relationship between the different works represented in the database. In our case, this will be exemplified by the works of Sebastian Brant (1457 - 1521), a humanist and satirist from Basel/Strassburg who published 1494 AD an allegory called "Das Narrenshiff" (the fools ship). This work was very influential and incorporated many engravings by Albrecht Duerrer. Within the framework of our web-application, experts worldwide will have the possibility to link pages or areas of pages to other works, pages, page-areas or images, available either in- or externally, in a intuitive manner using a GUI and comment these links. The general user will have the possibility to follow these commented links and perform network analysis in order to find non-obvious connections between the different works...|$|R
40|$|The hypertextual {{edition of}} Informatio status Marchie anconitane means to offer, through an {{organized}} network of links, a better possibility {{to read and}} use the documentary text. The Informatio is {{a report on the}} political conditions of the Marca anconitana drawn up in June 1341 by a Papal legate on the order of Pope Benedetto XII. In order to draw up the report, the Papal legate carried out a research in several centres of the Marca and consulted about 60 people. Therefore, the text is essentially formed by a series of evidences with information and opinions about the government of the Papal monarchy in the area. The evidences are all based on the same inquisitorial articles proposed by the legate. In the witnesses and in the people mentioned in the evidences it is possible to identify the protagonists of the historical scene of the Marca {{during the first half of}} the 14 th century. It comes from this last aspect the idea that an hypertextual edition could offer a precious opportunity to read in a more effective way a text that both in the structure and in its contents can be defìned as 'circular'. The editions means to establish a constant relation among the textual aspects, the historical fact and the interpretation. For this reason it is accompanied by a traditional essay that wants to reproduce a political geography of Marca during the fìrst half of the 14 th century and that especially means to study the systems the people involved in the research used to express the awareness oft he political situation of their time. In order to offer the possibility to have a synchronical reading of the documentary text with the contextual historical facts, three types of <b>hypertextual</b> <b>links</b> have been realized. The fìrst type is about the people mentioned in the document and it refers to more than 30 prosopographic cards. The second type is about the places where the research is carried out and the ones mentioned in the document and it connects the link to two thematic and geographical maps. One of them uses a simple animation. The third type is about the political vocabulary and it offers some cards of hystorical and interpretative analysis of the key words the evidences revolve around. The hypertext is completed by a general bibliography...|$|R
40|$|Hypermedia {{applications}} {{tend to use}} simple representations for navigation: most commonly, nodes {{are organized}} within an unconstrained graph, and users are presented with embedded links or lists of links. Recently, new data structures have emerged which may serve as alternative models for both the organization, and presentation, of <b>hypertextual</b> nodes and <b>links.</b> In this paper, we consider zzstructures, mSpaces, and polyarchies {{from the perspective of}} graph theory, and compare these models formally. The novel aspects of this work include: providing a sound, graph-theoretic analysis of zzstructures; the identi cation of a new class of polyarchies associated with mSpaces; and the comparison and classi- cation of these and other structures within a taxonomy. The taxonomy that results from our comparison allows us to consider, rst, what the distinct characteristics of each model are at a fundamental level, and second, what model or attributes of a model may be most appropriate for the design goals of a given hypermedia application.
