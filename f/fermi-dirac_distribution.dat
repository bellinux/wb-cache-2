The two distributions differ because multiple bosons can occupy the same quantum state, while multiple fermions cannot.

2500|$|There is also {{an older}} approach, based on a seminal paper by Nordheim in 1928, that formulates the problem {{differently}} and then uses first Kp and then εn (or a related quantity) as the variables of integration: {{this is known as}} [...] "integrating via the normal-energy distribution". This approach continues to be used by some authors. Although it has some advantages, particularly when discussing resonance phenomena, it requires integration of the <b>Fermi–Dirac</b> <b>distribution</b> function in the first stage of integration: for non-free-electron-like electronic band-structures this can lead to very complex and error-prone mathematics (as in the work of Stratton on semiconductors).

2500|$|The first form can {{be termed}} a density-of-states based entropy. The <b>Fermi–Dirac</b> <b>distribution</b> implies that each eigenstate of a system, , is {{occupied}} {{with a certain}} probability, [...] As the entropy is given by a sum over the probabilities of occupation of those states, there is an entropy associated with the occupation of the various electronic states. In most molecular systems, the energy spacing between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital is usually large, and thus the probabilities associated with the occupation of the excited states are small. Therefore, the electronic entropy in molecular systems can safely be neglected. Electronic entropy is thus most relevant for the thermodynamics of condensed phases, where the density of states at the Fermi level can be quite large, and the electronic entropy can thus contribute substantially to thermodynamic behavior. A second form of electronic entropy {{can be attributed to}} the configurational entropy associated with localized electrons and holes.FePO4 ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we show {{two kinds}} of {{entangled}} many body systems with special statistic properties. Firstly, an entangled fermions system with a pairwise entanglement between every two particles in the lowest energy energy level obeys the fractional statistics. As a check, for particle number N= 2, N= 3 and N= 4, considering that any two fermions in the lowest Landau level are entangled in a proper way, the Laughlin wave function can be derived. The results reveals the explicit entanglement pattern of the Laughlin states. Secondly, we noticed that both Bose-Einstein statistics and <b>Fermi-Dirac</b> <b>distributions</b> are derived from computing the partial function of a free quantum many body system in a certain ensemble without considering entanglement. We extend the computation of the partial function to an entangled quantum many body system without interaction, in this system we assume that every particle in energy level ϵ_i is entangled with a particle in the energy level ϵ_i+ 1 (i= 1, 3, 5, [...] .) and also every particle in energy level ϵ_i+ 1 is entangled with a particle in the energy level ϵ_i (i= 1, 3, 5, [...] .), which indicates that the two energy level have {{the same number of}} particles.
