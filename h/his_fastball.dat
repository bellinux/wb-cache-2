5|$|Bautista throws three pitches: a fastball, a curveball, and a changeup. <b>His</b> <b>fastball</b> {{travels in}} the high 90mph range. His curve can break down sharply, and he learned the changeup from Pedro Martínez. Wildness had {{been a problem for}} Bautista {{throughout}} his career. He has trouble controlling <b>his</b> <b>fastball</b> and walks a great deal of hitters, which has often contributed to his departure from teams.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt {{had three}} {{different}} kinds of pitches: a sinking fastball (which is rare for a lefty), a curveball, and a split. <b>His</b> <b>fastball</b> travelled in the low nineties, and while his curveball was not fast, it had late breaking action and {{got a lot of}} swing-throughs. Affeldt induced groundballs at a high rate with his sinking fastball and could also get the strikeout when the situation called for it.|$|E
5|$|Lieber threw three pitches: a fastball, a slider, and a changeup. The slider was {{the pitch}} Lieber {{often used to}} get outs and was most {{successful}} against right-handed batters. The changeup darted away from batters. Lieber was not a hard thrower (<b>his</b> <b>fastball</b> was in the low 90mph range); he relied on controlling his pitches to have success.|$|E
50|$|With a three-quarter {{right-handed}} side throw, <b>his</b> <b>fastballs</b> register up to 151 km/h on {{the radar}} gun. And while he can deliver a slider and occasional change-up, he relied mostly on <b>his</b> <b>fastballs</b> during <b>his</b> career in the industrial leagues.|$|R
50|$|Doyle's fastball {{does not}} have great velocity. As a result, he throws <b>his</b> two-seam <b>fastball</b> more often than <b>his</b> four-seam <b>fastball.</b> He also has a curveball, slider, and changeup. Doyle relies on control of his pitches.|$|R
50|$|Villarreal throws three pitches: a four-seam and two-seam fastball that tops out {{at about}} 100 mph, and a slider {{in the upper}} 80s. Villarreal likes {{to get ahead of}} hitters with <b>his</b> <b>fastballs</b> and then use his slider to put them away.|$|R
5|$|Mota {{has three}} {{different}} kinds of pitches: a fastball, a slider, and a circle changeup. The slider is the pitch he usually uses to get outs. Wildness {{has been a problem}} for him, though, and <b>his</b> <b>fastball</b> is easy to hit when thrown over the plate. In the past, he has thrown a splitter and a curveball.|$|E
5|$|By early 2011, Hughes's {{velocity}} on <b>his</b> <b>fastball</b> {{was down}} several mph; John Harper of the New York Daily News speculated that Hughes's overuse of the cutter was to blame, not a dead arm. Hughes {{continued to use}} the cutter into {{the start of the}} 2012 season; he posted a 7.88 ERA in April, throwing the cutter about 12% of the time in this span. In early May, Hughes dropped the cutter from his repertoire, using it only 1.2% of the time {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, as a sophomore, Strasburg was {{converted}} to a full-time starting pitcher. He went 8–3 with a 1.58 ERA and 134 strikeouts in 98⅓ innings. Four of his thirteen starts in 2008 were complete games, two of which were shutouts. On April 11 of that year, he struck out a Mountain West Conference record 23 batters in a game versus the University of Utah. He also gained eight miles per hour on <b>his</b> <b>fastball,</b> regularly working in the upper 90s and touching 100mph.|$|E
25|$|During that offseason, <b>his</b> <b>fastballs</b> {{first began}} to {{regularly}} sit around 87mph (140km/h). After pitching his school to the championship of the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament (Spring Koshien), Matsuzaka set his aim on the 1998 Summer Koshien and eventually led his school to the championship.|$|R
50|$|Kuo {{was born}} in Tainan City, Taiwan. Originally a shortstop, he started to pitch {{in high school and}} {{immediately}} became well known for <b>his</b> high quality <b>fastball</b> and slider. In the 1983 Chinese Taipei versus South Korea match in Asian Baseball Championship, Kuo did not allow a run to score during 17 consecutive innings, while <b>his</b> <b>fastballs</b> clocked up to 154 km/h (96 mph). He finally won the game and helped Chinese Taipei qualify for the 1984 Summer Olympics.|$|R
50|$|Igawa is {{also known}} for his unique follow-through, in which he throws his left leg {{into the air and}} return his {{pitching}} arm to a high position. Since he does not do this with his off-speed pitches as often as <b>his</b> <b>fastballs,</b> it might become easier for batters to distinguish whether a pitch is off-speed or not.|$|R
5|$|Looking {{to build}} on the success of his 2014 season, Hughes went into the 2015 season as the Twins ace. Hughes had lost {{velocity}} in <b>his</b> <b>fastball,</b> dropping from 93MPH to 92MPH. His 2015 season was marred with inconsistency and injury as he only started 25 times while appearing 2 times out of the bullpen. Despite going 11-9, his ERA was 4.40 and he served up 29 home runs in only 155.1 innings.|$|E
5|$|To aid his {{recovery}} from Tommy John surgery, Fernández {{cut back on}} the use of <b>his</b> <b>fastball</b> during spring training in 2016 and began working on his secondary pitches. Appearing as a pinch hitter in the 12th inning against the Atlanta Braves on July 1, Fernández doubled in two runs to put the Marlins ahead 7–5, which ended up being the final score. He became just the second pitcher in Marlins history to produce a game-winning hit, following Dennis Cook on August 1, 1997. Fernández appeared in the 2016 MLB All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|Beckett grew up idolizing fellow Texans Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens. As a youth, he starred on Little League All-Star teams. He later {{attended}} Spring High School in Spring, Texas. He {{had trouble}} with grades and {{not paying attention to}} his coach during his freshman year. His coach was so frustrated with him he threw him off the team. He went through a growth spurt before his sophomore year and added speed to <b>his</b> <b>fastball.</b> He also raised his GPA and was able {{to get back on the}} team, where he had a 9–3 record with a 1.18 earned run average (ERA) as a sophomore, tossing three no-hitters.|$|E
50|$|Stroman's {{repertoire}} includes six pitches: <b>his</b> four-seam <b>fastball</b> and two-seam fastball average 93 mph and 92 mph respectively. His off-speed pitches {{include a}} curveball at 82 mph, a changeup at 85 mph, a cutter at 90 mph, and a slider at 85 mph. He has relied more on <b>his</b> two-seam <b>fastball</b> (about 41-44%) since the 2015 season.|$|R
5000|$|Robertson's best {{pitch is}} <b>his</b> four-seam <b>fastball,</b> {{followed}} by a [...] "plus" [...] slider and major-league quality change-up.|$|R
50|$|As of June 23, 2016, Peavy has the 12th lowest career WHIP {{of active}} Major Leaguer. Peavy's two-seam fastball acts {{primarily}} as a sinker and induces many ground balls. This can allow Peavy to induce many double plays when runners are on base. Peavy likes to run <b>his</b> <b>fastballs</b> in on lefties and make the pitch break back into the zone, similar to a power version of Greg Maddux's technique.|$|R
5|$|On April 21, 2015, Davis {{pitched a}} perfect eighth inning in {{the losing side}} of a blowout against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, {{retiring}} all 3 batters he faced, all on ground balls, using only 9 pitches. Davis in high school was 23–0 with a 1.85 ERA and was the Arizona High School Pitcher of the Year, and in college he had a 2.25 ERA as a pitcher. Against the Angels he threw <b>his</b> <b>fastball</b> as high as 88 miles per hour, threw a slider in the high 70s, and threw a cutter. It {{was the first time}} the A’s had a position player pitch since Frank Menechino in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The year 1956 was {{not very}} {{different}} from 1955 for Koufax. Despite the blazing speed of <b>his</b> <b>fastball,</b> Koufax continued to struggle with his control. He saw little work, pitching only 58.7 innings with a 4.91 ERA, 29 walks and 30 strikeouts. When Koufax allowed baserunners, he was rarely permitted to finish the inning. Teammate Joe Pignatano said that, as soon as Koufax threw a couple of balls in a row, Alston would signal for a replacement to start warming up in the bullpen. Jackie Robinson, in his final season, clashed with Alston on Koufax's usage. Robinson saw that Koufax was talented and had flashes of brilliance, and objected to Koufax being benched {{for weeks at a}} time.|$|E
5|$|The next year, Taylor pitched for the Double-A Albany-Colonie Yankees, {{where the}} Yankees {{planned to have}} Taylor work on his curveball, as they already felt that <b>his</b> <b>fastball</b> {{was good enough for}} the major leagues. Entering the season, he was named baseball's second-best {{prospect}} behind Chipper Jones. That year, Taylor had a 137 record, a 3.48 ERA, and 150 strikeouts in 163 innings, and also led the Eastern League with 102 walks. In 1994, he was expected to pitch for the Triple-A Columbus Clippers of the International League, and start for the Yankees to begin the 1995 season at the latest, dependent on how he would have performed in spring training. After the season ended, the Yankees wanted Taylor to take part in an instructional league to work on his fundamentals. Taylor declined to attend the camp, and instead chose to return to his home in North Carolina.|$|E
50|$|Listed at 6 ft and 205 lb, Timlin threw and batted right-handed. Timlin {{was known}} for <b>his</b> 93 mph <b>fastball.</b> <b>His</b> sliders and sinkers had a {{downward}} break, inducing {{a significant number of}} ground balls.|$|R
50|$|Parnell, in {{his short}} major league career, has already {{developed}} {{a reputation for being}} a flamethrower. <b>His</b> <b>fastballs</b> consistently touch the high-90s, sometimes eclipsing 100 MPH. On August 18, 2010, in a game against the Houston Astros, Parnell hit 102.5 MPH on the radar gun, the fastest pitch in the Major Leagues in 2010 up to that point. Cincinnati Reds rookie Aroldis Chapman set the new mark on August 31, 2010 at 103.9 MPH.|$|R
50|$|A {{native of}} Ibaraki, Ishizaki started playing {{baseball}} {{in grade school}} and continued all the way until he entered Sanwa High School. His school {{made it to the}} 3rd round of the prefectural tournament, but failed to make it to Koshien. During that time, <b>his</b> <b>fastballs</b> already sparked the interest of some scouts as it reached the 145 km/h levels, but in the end, none of the 12 NPB teams drafted him when he graduated high school.|$|R
5|$|Capel {{enrolled}} at the University of Texas in 1981, but did not play baseball, as stretched ligaments in his elbow forced him to miss his freshman season. Capel pitched sidearmed {{for the remainder of}} his collegiate career to compensate for a loss in the velocity of <b>his</b> <b>fastball.</b> In 1982, he was named to the All-Southwest Conference team and pitched to a 9–0 win–loss record with a 3.68 ERA, as the Longhorns finished 59–6. His 1982 winning percentage of 1.000 ties him with 10 others for the best single-season winning percentage in Longhorns history (with a minimum of nine decisions). At the 1982 College World Series, Texas defeated the Oklahoma State Cowboys and the Stanford Cardinal, but losses to the Miami Hurricanes and the Wichita State Shockers eliminated them from play per the tournament's double-elimination format. Capel played on the United States team in the 1982 Amateur World Series overseen by the International Baseball Federation. Starting against Australia, he pitched a 14–4 complete game victory, as the match ended after seven innings per the championship's ten-run rule. The United States eventually placed third in the competition.|$|E
25|$|Before the 2007 season, Baseball America ranked Chamberlain as the 4th-best {{prospect}} in the pitching-rich Yankee organization, and the 75th-best prospect in Major League Baseball, {{and ranked}} <b>his</b> <b>fastball</b> {{as the best}} in the Yankee farm system.|$|E
25|$|In November 2012, Kazmir {{signed with}} Gigantes de Carolina of the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League. While he posted a 4.37 ERA, {{he struck out}} 27 batters in 23 innings and <b>his</b> <b>fastball</b> {{velocity}} {{was reported to be}} back in the 94–95 MPH range.|$|E
2500|$|During that time, {{he built}} a {{reputation}} as a strong armed hurler who was able to challenge hitters with <b>his</b> live <b>fastball.</b> <b>His</b> repertoire of pitches also included a sinker, slider, curveball, and a deceptive changeup. Total records are not known at this time, but McDuffie probably amassed nearly 200 wins along the way in the many baseball circuits in which he played.|$|R
50|$|Haren threw a 89 to 92 mph four-seam fastball, a 89 to 92 mph two-seam fastball, a sharp 84 to 86 mph split-finger fastball, and a 76 to 79 mph spike curve. Haren {{had also}} added and relied heavily upon a 85 to 87 mph cut fastball, which he added in 2008 and had {{credited}} with rejuvenating his career. The cut fastball made {{up more than}} half of his pitch selection to right-handed hitters, with <b>his</b> <b>fastballs</b> and occasional split-finger fastball filling up most of the rest. Against lefties, Haren mixed all of his pitches but used <b>his</b> two-seam <b>fastball</b> the most. <b>His</b> curveball was a change-of-pace pitch, and not a main weapon; he didn't throw it much to right-handers or in two-strike counts. By contrast, he threw about half of his splitters with two strikes.|$|R
50|$|Though he {{has come}} to use his respectable {{repertoire}} of offspeed pitches more often in recent years, he is best known for <b>his</b> four-seam <b>fastball.</b>|$|R
25|$|Fields {{struggled}} with <b>his</b> <b>fastball</b> velocity {{in spring training}} in 2017 and was optioned to the Triple-A Oklahoma City Dodgers to begin the season. However, he {{was added to the}} active roster a few days later when Rich Hill was placed on the disabled list.|$|E
25|$|Maddux {{relied on}} his command, composure, and guile to outwit hitters. Though <b>his</b> <b>fastball</b> touched 93mph {{in his early}} years, his {{velocity}} steadily declined throughout his career, and was never his principal focus as a pitcher. By {{the end of his}} career, <b>his</b> <b>fastball</b> averaged less than 86mph. Maddux was also noted for the late movement on his sinker (two-seam fastball), which, combined with his control, made him known as an excellent groundball pitcher. While Maddux was not known for his strikeout totals, his strikeout totals have often been undersold because strikeout rate has often been measured per nine innings, rather than per batter faced. Maddux alternated his two-seam fastball with an excellent circle changeup. Though these served as his primary pitches, he also threw a four-seam fastball, a cutter, a curveball, a slider, and a splitter.|$|E
25|$|Chamberlain threw a four-seam fastball {{that early}} in his career was {{regularly}} in the mid-to-upper 90s, topping out at 101mph. After his arm surgery, <b>his</b> <b>fastball</b> was in the 93-94mph range, topping out around 97-98. He also threw a slider anywhere from 82 to 88mph, a curveball at 78–81mph, and an occasional changeup at 83–85mph.|$|E
50|$|Eveland {{throws a}} four-seam fastball, slider, changeup, and curveball. As of 2014, he began {{throwing}} more sliders and substituted <b>his</b> four-seam <b>fastball</b> with a two-seam fastball.|$|R
50|$|Maroth {{was not an}} overpowering pitcher, rarely {{touching}} 88 MPH on <b>his</b> two-seam <b>fastball.</b> He also {{threw an}} 80 MPH cutter with a curveball and a changeup.|$|R
50|$|Rondon relies {{primarily}} on <b>his</b> four-seam <b>fastball</b> (96 mph), slider (85 mph), and also mixing in a sinker (96 mph). He also rarely throws a changeup (90 mph).|$|R
