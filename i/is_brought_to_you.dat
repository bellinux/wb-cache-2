60|$|How I {{did learn}} to hate those little dishes and their greasy contents! At a London eating-house things {{are often not}} very nice, but your meat is put on a plate and comes before you in an edible shape. At these hotels it <b>is</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in horrid little oval dishes, and swims in grease; gravy is not an {{institution}} in American hotels, but grease has taken its place. It is palpable, undisguised grease, floating in rivers--not grease caused by accidental bad cookery, but grease on purpose. A beef-steak is not a beef-steak unless {{a quarter of a}} pound of butter be added to it. Those horrid little dishes! If one thinks of it, how could they have been made to contain Christian food? Every article in that long list is liable to the call of any number of guests for four hours. Under such circumstances how can food be made eatable? Your roast mutton <b>is</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> raw; if you object to that, you are supplied with meat that has been four times brought before the public. At hotels on the Continent of Europe different dinners are cooked at different hours; but here the same dinner is kept always going. The house breakfast is maintained on a similar footing. Huge boilers of tea and coffee are stewed down and kept hot. To me those meals were odious. It is of course open to any one to have separate dinners and separate breakfasts in his own rooms; but by this little is gained and much is lost. He or she who is so exclusive pays twice over for such meals--as they are charged as extras on the bill--and, after all, receives the advantage of no exclusive cooking. Particles from the public dinners are brought to the private room, and the same odious little dishes make their appearance.|$|E
6000|$|But Mr Reddypalm {{was a man}} of humble desires, whose ambitions soared {{no higher}} than this--that his little bills should be duly settled. It is {{wonderful}} what love an innkeeper has for his bill in its entirety. An account, with a respectable total of five or six pounds, <b>is</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and you complain but of one article; that fire in the bedroom was never lighted; or that second glass of brandy and water was never called for. You desire to have the shilling expunged, and all your host's pleasure in the whole transaction is destroyed. Oh! my friends, pay for the brandy and water, though you never drank it; suffer the fire to pass, though it never warmed you. Why make a good man miserable for such a trifle? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And look up, Victorine; look up, dearest. I {{would have}} you {{prepared}} for the worst. Listen to me now calmly, love, and then I need not harrow you with these thoughts again. It may be God's pleasure that I should outlive this war; but as, with His will, I am determined that I will never lay down my sword till the soldiers of the Republic are driven from the province, it is most improbable that I should do so. You must teach yourself, Victorine, to look for my death, as an event certain to occur, which any day may bring forth; and when the heavy news <b>is</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> bear it as a Christian woman should bear the afflictions of this, world. I do not ask you not to weep for me, for that would be putting too violent a constraint upon your nature, but do not weep over much. Above all, Victorine, do not allow your sorrow to paralyse your actions. You will have to act then, not only for yourself, but for your child--for my daughter; and if you then {{give way to the}} violence of sorrow, who shall think and care for her?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Whoever has {{introduced}} these simple forms of religions among these poor savages, has evidently understood their characters and capacities, and effected a great melioration of their manners. Of this we speak not merely from {{the testimony of}} Captain Bonneville, but likewise from that of Mr. Wyeth, who passed some months in a travelling camp of the Flatheads. [...] "During the time I have been with them," [...] says he, [...] "I have never known an instance of theft among them: the least thing, even to a bead or pin, <b>is</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> if found; and often, {{things that have been}} thrown away. Neither have I known any quarrelling, nor lying. This absence of all quarrelling the more surprised me, when I came to see the various occasions that would have given rise to it among the whites: the crowding together of from twelve to eighteen hundred horses, which have to be driven into camp at night, to be picketed, to be packed in the morning; the gathering of fuel in places where it is extremely scanty. All this, however, is done without confusion or disturbance.|$|E
