The song was produced by Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco with vocal editing done by Emily Wright. While being interviewed by MTV, Foreman explained the song's inspiration: [...] "The song is about a girl you really like, and the story line of <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> first kiss with a girl to exploring further parts of the relationship." [...] While composing the song, Foreman and Motte decided {{that they needed to}} add a female to the song. Kesha, who had worked with Blanco and Luke, was asked to participate in the song and later came into the studio to contribute her lines.|$|E
500|$|In 1998 Nolan {{directed}} his first feature, which he personally funded and filmed with friends. Following depicts an unemployed young writer (Jeremy Theobald) who trails strangers through London, hoping they will provide material {{for his first}} novel, but is drawn into a criminal underworld when he fails to keep his distance. The film was inspired by Nolan's experience of living in London and having his flat burgled: [...] "There is an interesting connection between a stranger <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>your</b> possessions {{and the concept of}} following people at random through a crowd – both take you beyond the boundaries of ordinary social relations". Following was made on a modest budget of £3,000, and was shot on weekends {{over the course of a}} year. To conserve film stock, each scene in the film was rehearsed extensively to ensure that the first or second take could be used in the final edit. Co-produced with Emma Thomas and Jeremy Theobald, Nolan wrote, photographed and edited the film himself. Following won several awards during its festival run and was well received by critics; The New Yorker wrote that it [...] "echoed Hitchcock classics", but was [...] "leaner and meaner". Janet Maslin of The New York Times was impressed with its [...] "spare look" [...] and agile hand-held camerawork, [...] "As a result, the actors convincingly carry off the before, during and after modes that the film eventually, and artfully, weaves together." [...] On 11 December 2012, it was released on DVD and Blu-ray as part of the Criterion Collection.|$|E

5000|$|... "Home" [...] is an autobiographical song {{describing}} {{life in the}} Jackson {{family and}} the closeness once shared among Jackson and her siblings. A press release describes the song as being [...] "written with affection about her childhood memories {{and based on the}} premise that no matter where you are or what you are <b>going</b> <b>through</b> in <b>your</b> life, you can always go Home." [...] It is notable for a bursting refrain reminiscent of the achingly climactic verse heard in Simon and Garfunkel's signature tune [...] "Homeward Bound." [...] The lyrics hint at Jackson's exile from the family in the early 1990s when she was under the control of abusive manager Jack Gordon. Jackson expresses remorse over the [...] "many years that we let pass" [...] having been [...] "parted by the fame we grew to only know." [...] The song alludes also to La Toya's affectionate pet name for Michael, [...] "Joker." ...|$|R

Although in initial interviews she refused to reveal the title or concept, she said the album was personal to her. [...] "You can't help but put not only your kids into it, but to put anything you are <b>going</b> <b>through</b> in <b>your</b> music", she said. [...] "he {{only thing you can}} really sing or write is stuff that you know. The more music you make and the more that you get into it and the more you write, the more you realize that's all you can write." [...] In October 2009, People magazine revealed that Lopez's album was going to be called Love?. She would tell KIIS FM's DJ Skee that she had chosen to call her album Love? because love was something that still confused her. [...] "Love is the most confusing thing in the world, that's why the album is called Love with a question mark." [...] Lopez told The Advocates Brandon Voss that she also took into account the gay community and how they might feel towards the album. She said all her previous albums had a universal appeal and the LGBT community had played a part in the success of her music in the past, e.g. [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] (1999).|$|R

6000|$|We have at last {{authentic}} {{news from}} the interior. A letter has arrived from the prisoners, dated Dec. 15th (I can hardly understand how, at the Shoho rate of travelling, it can have come so fast), in which they report that the King of Shoa, who was besieging Magdala, and upon whose assistance Colonel Merewether had built much, has retired from before the place, {{and that it is}} now open to Theodore. This is certainly bad news. Not that I have ever put the smallest trust in the assistance of any of these kinglings. On the contrary, I think that the policy which has been hitherto pursued with respect to the natives has been a mistake. We should have never asked for alliance or friendship. We are perfectly strong enough to go on by ourselves, and were we not it is certain that we could place no reliance upon any professions of friendship. Why, then, make the natives think we are weak by asking for allies? Say firmly to each king, “We are <b>going</b> on <b>through</b> <b>your</b> country to fetch the prisoners beyond. We are perfectly strong enough to do this, and anything beside which may be necessary. We go through and return without making any stay. In your country are many kings and many rivals. We need no assistance, and we know that if we enter into alliance with one chief we gain the enmity of another by so doing. We wish not, therefore, to enter into any alliance whatever. We are friends passing <b>through</b> <b>your</b> country. We require stores, cattle, &c., and we mean to have them; but we pay for everything we require, and that at prices which the imagination of the herd-and flock-owner of Abyssinia never before conceived even in his wildest dreams.” ...|$|R

[...] Consequence of Sound, in a 2015 top 10 of Blink-182's best songs, ranked [...] "Dammit" [...] at number one, commenting, [...] "The best songwriters don't capture what you're <b>going</b> <b>through</b> individually in <b>your</b> life – they capture the things that are common to all humanity, and there's something about [...] "Dammit"'s chorus, something about its opening C, D, E riff that sounds universal." [...] Complex in 2012 examined the song through the lens of its inclusion in Can't Hardly Wait (1998), calling it, [...] "one of the most iconic songs of the 90s – those three, unmistakable guitar chords, the two voices trading in verse (one sneering punk, the other, a throaty few octaves lower), and a soaring punk chorus." [...] At Billboard, it is described as a [...] "jump-around pop punk song".|$|R

Speaking about the inspiration behind the track Jessica described it as, [...] "... that elated, euphoric feeling of love at first sight...

She had been working on the album during pregnancy, {{but it was not until}} the birth of her twins, Max and Emme, that she was able to focus on the project.

[...] At the time of the interview, two of the album's songs had leaked. The first, titled [...] "(What Is) Love?", was written by Wynter Gordon and co-written and produced by Emile Dernst II (D'Mile). After expressing dismay at the song's leak, its writer (Wynter Gordon) spoke of why the song was very personal to her: [...] " [...] not knowing what love is ...I felt like so many woman have that same story. No fathers, families, abusive boyfriends and husbands..no parental support, they feel alone [...]. I've had my few relationships and have yet to feel love [...]" [...] Jean Baptist produced a 'part-two' for the song, which was mentioned at one of the album pre-release parties, attended by Rap-Up magazine, however the second part of the song was omitted from the track listing. The original version of the song, under the title [...] "What Is Love", was included on the soundtrack to the 2010 film, The Back-up Plan, starring Lopez.|$|R
