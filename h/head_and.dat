5|$|A stylized {{flower of}} a Hippeastrum {{cultivar}} (under its common name of amaryllis) is used internationally {{as a symbol}} for organizations associated with Huntington's disease, a genetic degenerative disease of the nervous system. The widely used logo represents a double image of a <b>head</b> <b>and</b> shoulders as the flower of a growing and vibrant plant. The reduced size of the inner <b>head</b> <b>and</b> shoulders image symbolizes the diminution in a person caused by Huntington's disease. The leaves represent the protection, purpose, growth {{and development of the}} Huntington's community worldwide in its search for a cure and treatment.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the DNA {{differences}} between head lice and body lice provide corroborating evidence that humans used clothing between 80,000 and 170,000 years ago, before leaving Africa. Human <b>head</b> <b>and</b> body lice occupy distinct ecological zones: head lice live and {{feed on the}} scalp, while body lice live on clothing and feed on the body. Because body lice require clothing to survive, the divergence of <b>head</b> <b>and</b> body lice from their common ancestor provides {{an estimate of the}} date of introduction of clothing in human evolutionary history.|$|E

5|$|Against All Odds {{official}} {{began with}} a standard match between Elix Skipper and Petey Williams, who was accompanied by Coach D'Amore. The match ended when Skipper performed a move in which he holds his opponent upside-down and around his back. He grabs their <b>head</b> <b>and</b> falls to a seated position to caused their <b>head</b> <b>and</b> neck to be forced into the mat, a move he dubbed the Sudden Death. Skipper followed by covering Williams for the pinfall.|$|E

Between the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> the thorax is a tufted scale called the pronotum. On either side is a shield-like scale called a scapula. In the Noctuoidea, the metathorax is modified {{with a pair of}} tympanal organs.|$|E

5|$|Cockroaches are {{generalized}} insects, {{with few}} special adaptations, {{and may be}} among the most primitive living neopteran insects. They have a relatively small <b>head</b> <b>and</b> a broad, flattened body, and most species are reddish-brown to dark brown. They have large compound eyes, two ocelli, and long, flexible antennae. The mouthparts are {{on the underside of the}} <b>head</b> <b>and</b> include generalized chewing mandibles, salivary glands and various touch and taste receptors.|$|E

5|$|In the holotype specimen, a female, the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{body length}} was 310mm (12.2in), the tail length was 210mm (8.3in), the {{hindfoot}} length was 66.8mm (2.63in), the ear length was 17.5mm (0.69in), {{and the body}} mass was 675g (24oz). In another specimen, a male which was captured and released, the <b>head</b> <b>and</b> body length was about 330mm (13in), the tail length was about 175mm (6.9in), and the body mass was 600g (21oz). Based on these limited data, S.durrelli may be slightly smaller than the brown-tailed mongoose.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} common {{correlations}} between sentence-level word order and phrase-level constituent order. For example, SOV languages generally put modifiers before <b>heads</b> <b>and</b> use postpositions. VSO languages tend to place modifiers after their <b>heads,</b> <b>and</b> use prepositions. For SVO languages, either order is common.|$|R
