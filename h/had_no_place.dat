5|$|After Morocco's {{independence}} in 1956, {{a strong emphasis}} was laid on the country's Arab identity, and a national Arabic language educational system was instituted, in which Berber languages, including Middle Atlas Tamazight, <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place.</b> However, in 1994 the government responded to Berber demands for recognition by decreeing that Berber should be taught and establishing television broadcasts in three Berber languages, including Central Atlas Tamazight. For the promotion of Tamazight and other Berber languages and cultures, the government created the Royal Institute of Amazigh Culture (IRCAM) in 2001.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the Supreme Commander in the Southwest Pacific Area, General Douglas MacArthur, {{requested}} a Naval officer for his General Headquarters (GHQ) to replace Captain Herbert J. Ray, an {{officer who had}} escaped from the Philippines with him in 1942. Ray had been appointed to command the battleship , and Tarbuck was chosen to replace him. En route to Australia, Tarbuck met with Admiral Chester Nimitz, who told him {{in no uncertain terms}} that anti-Army and anti-MacArthur sentiments <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> in his command. As it was, Tarbuck became a loyal supporter of MacArthur.|$|E
5|$|Nickel, {{formerly}} {{used in the}} cent, now <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> in American coinage. This was unsatisfactory to Wharton, {{who sought}} its return. Although Pollock {{made no mention of}} further nickel coinage in his 1864 annual report, Wharton in April of that year published a pamphlet proposing that all non-precious metal coinage be composed of 75% copper and 25% nickel. The copper-nickel cents had contained only 12% nickel, and even so had been difficult for the Mint to strike due to the hardness of the metal, the use of which damaged equipment and quickly broke dies. An alloy of 25% nickel would be even more difficult to coin. Wharton argued that the tough alloy would be difficult to counterfeit.|$|E

5|$|Political and {{religious}} differences between old Missourians and newly-arriving Mormon settlers provoked {{tensions between the}} two groups, much as they had years earlier in Jackson County. By this time, Smith's experiences with mob violence led him to believe that his faith's survival required greater militancy against anti-Mormons. Around June 1838, recent convert Sampson Avard formed a covert organization called the Danites to intimidate Mormon dissenters and oppose anti-Mormon militia units. Though {{it is unclear how}} much Smith knew of the Danites' activities, he clearly approved of those of which he did know. After Rigdon delivered a sermon that implied dissenters <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> in the Mormon community, the Danites forcibly expelled them from the county.|$|E
5|$|The {{roughness}} of {{this version}} succeeded {{in a way}} the recorded version on 'Emotions' could never manage. In the sterile atmosphere of a studio, where perfection, technology, and overdubbing were the rules, spontaneity <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place.</b> On the stage, it was valued, and this performance had it. Everyone pushed everyone just a little further, to create something wonderful, and judging by the response, the audience realized it, as did Mariah when the song was finished. It was a rare moment, one that true performers strive for and don't find often enough to satisfy themselves.|$|E
5|$|After Jutland, Deutschland and {{her three}} {{surviving}} sisters returned to picket duty {{at the mouth of}} the Elbe. They were also occasionally transferred for guard duty in the Baltic. The experience at Jutland demonstrated that pre-dreadnoughts <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> in a naval battle with dreadnoughts, and they were thus left behind when the High Seas Fleet sortied again on 18 August. In July, KzS Rudolf Bartels replaced Meurer as the ship's captain; he held the position for just a month, before he was in turn replaced by Deutschlands final commander, KzS Reinhold Schmidt. In late 1916, the ships of the II Squadron were removed from the High Seas Fleet. From 22 December 1916 to 16 January 1917, Deutschland lay idle in the Bay of Kiel. On 24 January, the ship was taken to Hamburg where she went into the dry-dock for maintenance; this work lasted until 4 April. During this period in the shipyard, Deutschland had her forwardmost pair of 8.8cm guns in the aft superstructure removed and two 8.8cm guns in anti-aircraft mountings were installed.|$|E

5|$|Diplomatic efforts {{between the}} Netherlands and the Republic {{continued}} throughout 1948 and 1949. Political pressures, {{both domestic and}} international, hindered Dutch attempts to decide upon objectives. Similarly, Republican leaders faced great difficulty in persuading their people to accept diplomatic concessions. By July 1948 negotiations were in deadlock and the Netherlands pushed unilaterally towards Van Mook’s federal Indonesia concept. The new federal states of South Sumatra and East Java were created, although neither had a viable support base. The Netherlands set up the Bijeenkomst voor Federaal Overleg (BFO) (or Federal Consultative Assembly), a body comprising {{the leadership of the}} federal states, and charged with the formation of a United States of Indonesia and an interim government by the end of 1948. The Dutch plans, however, <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> for the Republic unless it accepted a minor role already defined for it. Later plans included Java and Sumatra but dropped all mention of the Republic. The main sticking point in the negotiations was the balance of power between the Netherlands High Representative and the Republican forces.|$|E
25|$|In 1764, the confreres petitioned royal {{authority}} {{to build a}} tomb, which was a typical of the period, since the space <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> to bury their dead. The tomb was located the eastern corner {{of the church and}} Misericórdia Velha.|$|E
25|$|Under the Belgian administration, Muslims in Rwanda were to {{some extent}} marginalized. Since Muslims <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> in the Catholic church, which {{maintained}} great influence over the state, Muslims were often excluded from education and important jobs in the government. As a result, Muslim employment was largely confined to engaging in petty trade, and taking up jobs as drivers.|$|E

25|$|The {{founders of}} Communism {{believed}} monogamy oppressed women and <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> in communist society. However, the Communist revolution in China changed these ideas as the communist revolutionaries in China viewed monogamy {{as a means}} of giving women and men equal rights in marriage. The newly formed Communist government established monogamy as the only legal form of marriage.|$|E
25|$|An early {{casualty}} of change was the Bombay Quadrangular tournament, {{which had been}} a focal point of Indian cricket for over 50 years. The new India <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> for teams based on ethnic origin. As a result, the Ranji Trophy came into its own as the national championship. The last-ever Bombay Pentangular, as it had become, was won by the Hindus in 1945–46.|$|E

25|$|WFM members {{walked out}} of the ore {{processing}} mills at Telluride on 1 September 1903, for a reduction in the workday from 12 hours to 8. The mill shutdowns caused a shutdown of most of the mines which <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> to send their ore to be processed. The ore mill for the Tom Boy mine tried to reopen with a nonunion workforce, but the WFM struck the Tom Boy mine, and posted picketers armed with pistols and rifles around the Tom Boy, preventing strikebreakers from entering.|$|E
25|$|Makart's {{painting}} The Entry of Charles V into Antwerp {{caused some}} controversy, because Charles V was depicted arriving in a procession surrounded by nude virgins; the offense was the mistaken {{idea that the}} nudes <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> in the modern scene. In the United States, the painting fell under the proscription of Anthony Comstock, which secured Makart's fame there. The American public desired at once to see what Comstock was persecuting, so they could tell whether he was acting correctly or in error.|$|E
25|$|For all its success, the Balloon Corps {{was never}} fully {{appreciated}} {{by the military}} community. They were still regarded as carnival showmen. Others had little respect for their break-neck operation. The only ones who found any value in them were the generals whose jobs and reputations were on the line. Lower-ranking administrators looked with disdain on this band of civilians who, as they perceived them, <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> in the military. Furthermore, none of the corps ever received a military commission, leaving them facing the dangers of being captured and treated as spies, summarily punishable by death.|$|E

25|$|This {{system of}} non-residence led {{also to the}} {{institution}} of vicars choral, each canon having his own vicar, who sat in his stall in his absence, and when the canon was present, in the stall immediately below, on the second form. The vicars <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> or vote in chapter, and, though irremovable except for offences, were the servants of their absent canons whose stalls they occupied, and whose duties they performed. Outside Britain they were often called demi-prebendaries. As time went on the vicars were themselves often incorporated {{as a kind of}} lesser chapter, or college, {{under the supervision of the}} dean and chapter.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{text of the}} Samkhya school, the Samkhya Karika, {{was written}} by Ishvara Krishna {{in the fourth century}} CE, by which time it was already a dominant Hindu school. The origins of the school are much older and are lost in legend. The school was both dualistic and atheistic. They believed in a dual existence of Prakriti ("nature") and Purusha ("spirit") and <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> for an Ishvara ("God") in its system, arguing that the existence of Ishvara cannot be proved and hence cannot be admitted to exist. The school dominated Hindu philosophy in its day, but declined after the tenth century, although commentaries were still being written as late as the sixteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Olmsted also {{designed}} the Summer House, the open-air brick building that sits {{just north of}} the Capitol. Three arches open into the hexagonal structure, which encloses a fountain and twenty-two brick chairs. A fourth wall holds a small window that looks onto an artificial grotto. Built between 1879 and 1881, the Summer House was intended to answer complaints that visitors to the Capitol <b>had</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> to sit and no place to obtain water for their horses and themselves. Modern drinking fountains have since replaced Olmsted's fountain for the latter purpose. Olmsted intended to build a second, matching Summer House on the southern side of the Capitol, but congressional objections led to the project's cancellation.|$|E
