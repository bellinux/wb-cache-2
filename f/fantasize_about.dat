A 2004 study by Pillsworth, Hasselton and Buss contradicted this, finding greater in-pair sexual attraction during this phase and no increase in attraction to extra-pair men.|$|E

However, Abagnale praised the idea. [...] "Even though I didn't see my dad again, every night after living a brilliant day and meeting many women, and making much money, I'd come back alone to a hotel room and I would just think of {{my mom and dad}} and <b>fantasize</b> <b>about</b> getting them back together again, and cry.

As a child, series creator Matt Groening and his friends would <b>fantasize</b> <b>about</b> an ultra violent cartoon and how much fun {{it would be to}} work on a show like that. The names [...] "Itchy" [...] and [...] "Scratchy" [...] were inspired by [...] "Pixie and Dixie," [...] who were mice on the cartoon show Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks. The comic strip Squeak the Mouse is also considered as an apparent inspiration for the characters. The show is also based on Herman and Katnip, a show that, according to director David Silverman, [...] "is hilarious because it's just bad." [...] As a child, Groening really liked the 1961 Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians, {{and it was one of}} the reasons to why he got into cartooning. In the film, the puppies watch television, and the idea that it is possible to have a cartoon within a cartoon thrilled Groening. From that idea he got the inspiration for The Itchy & Scratchy Show.|$|E
500|$|Maximilien Aue is {{a former}} officer of the SD, {{security}} and intelligence service of the SS; the book is written {{in the form of}} his memoirs. His mother was French (from Alsace), while his father, who left his mother and disappeared from their life in 1921, was German. Aue's mother remarried a Frenchman, Aristide Moreau, which Maximilien highly disapproved of. After a childhood in Germany and an adolescence in France, where he attends Sciences-Po, he later returns to Germany to study at the University of Berlin and the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. It is also during this period when he joins the SS, eventually rising to the rank of Obersturmbannführer. Aue is a cultured, highly educated, classical music-loving intellectual. He speaks many languages fluently – German, French, Ancient Greek and Latin – and holds a doctorate in law. Despite his French heritage and upbringing, he is, like his father, an ardent German nationalist. Even after the war, he is unrepentant of the crimes he committed in the name of National Socialism, [...] "believing that it was my duty and {{that it had to be}} done, disagreeable or unpleasant as it may have been." [...] He is extremely attracted to his twin sister Una, which led to an incestuous relationship with her when they were children, but ended when they entered puberty.

2500|$|The art design crew {{included}} background artist Peter Chan and cartoonist Scott Campbell. Voice actor Richard Steven Horvitz, {{best known}} for his portrayal of Zim in the cult favorite animated series Invader Zim, provides the voice of Raz, the game's protagonist. Initially the team tried to bring in children to provide the voices for the main cast, similar to Peanuts cartoons, but struggled with their lack of acting experience. Schafer had selected Horvitz based on his audition tapes and ability to provide a wide range of vocal intonations on the spot, providing them with numerous takes to work with. Raz was originally conceived as an ostrich suffering from mental imbalance and multiple personalities. Tim Schafer killed the idea because he strongly believes in games being [...] "wish fulfillments," [...] guessing that not many people <b>fantasize</b> <b>about</b> being an insane ostrich.|$|E

2500|$|The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition (DSM-5) has a {{significantly}} larger diagnostic features section for pedophilia {{than the previous}} DSM version, the DSM-IV-TR, and states, [...] "The diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder are intended to apply both to individuals who freely disclose this paraphilia and to individuals who deny any sexual attraction to prepubertal children (generally age 13 years or younger), despite substantial objective evidence to the contrary." [...] Like the DSM-IV-TR, the manual outlines specific criteria {{for use in the}} diagnosis of this disorder. These include the presence of sexually arousing fantasies, behaviors or urges that involve some kind of sexual activity with a prepubescent child (with the diagnostic criteria for the disorder extending the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13) for six months or more, or that the subject has acted on these urges or suffers from distress as a result of having these feelings. The criteria also indicate that the subject should be 16 or older and that the child or children they <b>fantasize</b> <b>about</b> are at least five years younger than them, though ongoing sexual relationships between a 12- to 13-year-old and a late adolescent are advised to be excluded. A diagnosis is further specified by the sex of the children the person is attracted to, if the impulses or acts are limited to incest, and if the attraction is [...] "exclusive" [...] or [...] "nonexclusive".|$|E
