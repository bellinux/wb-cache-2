The water distribution system includes over [...] of canal and with [...] of pipeline. The number of canal and pipeline branches number roughly over a hundred. Imported water and a long growing season allow two crop cycles each year, and the Imperial Valley is {{a major source of}} winter fruits and vegetables, cotton, and grain for U.S. and international markets. Alfalfa is another major crop produced in the Imperial Valley.

He said the weapon could only have exploded after an external event like a fire.

He also said Kursk was designed with two autonomous, independent control systems that would have detected a rise in temperature while the torpedo was stored on the racks. The sub was equipped with a special <b>drain</b> <b>system</b> that could rapidly drain hydrogen peroxide fuel from a torpedo into the sea. If a temperature rise was detected in the torpedo tube, the torpedo would have automatically been ejected into the sea. In addition, any fire in the torpedo compartment would have triggered a powerful fire-extinguishing system that would have dumped [...] "tons of water" [...] on the fire.|$|E

40|$|Urban {{stormwater}} runoff {{is traditionally}} defined as {{that portion of}} precipitation which drains from city surfaces exposed to precipitation and flows via natural or man-made drainage systems into receiving waters. But, urban stormwater runoff also includes discharges from many other anthropogenic activities/sources, which {{find their way into}} storm drainage systems. The importance of inappropriate discharges into storm <b>drain</b> <b>systems</b> stems from their significant impacts on receiving water quality. Initial studies by Pitt, et al. (1993) and Lalor (1994) reviewed various methodologies to investigate illicit discharges into storm <b>drain</b> <b>systems.</b> The Center for Watershed Protection (CWP) and the University of Alabama are currently conducting a technical assessment of techniques and methods for identifying and correcting illicit and inappropriate discharges geare...|$|R

50|$|Contaminated {{stormwater}} washed off parking lots, {{roads and}} highways, and lawns (often containing fertilizers and pesticides) is called urban runoff. This runoff is often {{classified as a}} type of NPS pollution. Some people may also consider it a point source because many times it is channeled into municipal storm <b>drain</b> <b>systems</b> and discharged through pipes to nearby surface waters. However, not all urban runoff flows through storm <b>drain</b> <b>systems</b> before entering water bodies. Some may flow directly into water bodies, especially in developing and suburban areas. Also, unlike other types of point sources, such as industrial discharges, sewage treatment plants and other operations, pollution in urban runoff cannot be attributed to one activity or even group of activities. Therefore, because it is not caused by an easily identified and regulated activity, urban runoff pollution sources are also often treated as true non-point sources as municipalities work to abate them.|$|R
