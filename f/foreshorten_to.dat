25|$|Historically, {{the constellations}} can be simply {{divided into two}} regions; namely the {{northern}} and southern sky, whose origins are distinctly different.

Evidence of these constellations have survived in the form of star charts, whose oldest representation appears on the statue known as the Farnese Atlas, which has been suggested {{to be based on the}} star catalogue of the Greek astronomer, Hipparchus. Southern hemisphere constellations are more modern inventions, which were created as new constellations, or become substitutes for some ancient constellation. e.g. Argo Navis. Some southern constellations were to become obsolete or had extended names that became <b>foreshortened</b> <b>to</b> more usable forms e.g. Musca Australis became simply Musca.|$|R

5000|$|Delacroix’s Death of Sardanapalus was {{controversial}} and polarizing at its {{exhibition at the}} Paris Salon of 1828 for one significant reason: {{it was not a}} Neoclassical painting. Delacroix’s main figural subject was Sardanapalus, a king willing to destroy all of his possessions, including people and luxurious goods, in a funerary pyre of gore and excess. This man was not a hero, like the Horatii in Jacques-Louis David’s painting. Delacroix’s Sardanapalus was the antithesis of neoclassical traditions, which favored subdued colors, rigid space, and an overall moral subject matter. He also used <b>foreshortening</b> <b>to</b> tilt the death scene directly into the space of the audience, {{a far cry from the}} subdued order of traditional academic paintings. Dorothy Bussy quotes one critic of the work as calling the painting [...] "the fanaticism of ugliness" [...] when it appeared in the Salon in 1828.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} a classification based tree detection method for autonomous navigation of forest vehicles in forest environment. Fusion of color, and texture cues {{has been used}} to segment the image into tree trunk and background objects. The segmentation of images into tree trunk and background objects is a challenging task due to high variations of illumination, effect of different color shades, non-homogeneous bark texture, shadows and <b>foreshortening.</b> <b>To</b> accomplish this, the approach has been to find the best combinations of color, and texture descriptors, and classification techniques. An additional task has been to estimate the distance between forest vehicle and the base of segmented trees using monocular vision. A simple heuristic distance measurement method is proposed that is based on pixel height and a reference width. The performance of various color and texture operators, and accuracy of classifiers has been evaluated using cross validation techniques...|$|R
40|$|Many {{low level}} visual {{computation}} {{problems such as}} focus, stereo, optical flow, etc. can be formulated as problems of extracting one or more parameters of a nonstationary transformation between two images. Because of the non-stationary nature, finite-width windows are widely used in various algorithms to extract spatially local information from images. While the choice of window width has a very profound impact {{on the quality of}} results of algorithms, there has been no quantitative way to measure or eliminate the negative effects of finite-width windows. To address this problem, We introduce two sets of filters, "moment" filters and "hypergeometric" filters. Due to their recursive properties, these filters allow the effects of finite-width windows and <b>foreshortening</b> <b>to</b> be explicitly analyzed and eliminated. We develop one paradigm to solve general one-parameter extraction problems using moment filters, and another one to solve general multiple parameter extraction problem using hyperge [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{theories}} of distance perception—ie, the angular expansion hypothesis (Durgin and Li, 2011 Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics 73 1856 – 1870) and the intrinsic bias hypothesis (Ooi et al, 2006 Perception 35 605 – 624) —are compared. Both theories attribute exocentric distance <b>foreshortening</b> <b>to</b> an exaggeration in perceived slant, but their fundamental geometrical assumptions are very different. The intrinsic bias hypothesis assumes a constant bias in perceived geographical slant {{of the ground}} plane and predicts both perceived egocentric and exocentric distances are increasingly compressed. In contrast, the angular expansion hypothesis assumes exaggerations in perceived gaze angle and perceived optical slant. Because the bias functions of the two angular variables are different, it allows the angular expansion hypothesis to distinguish two types of distance foreshortening—the linear compression in perceived egocentric distance and the nonlinear compression in perceived exocentric distance. While the intrinsic bias is proposed only for explaining distance biases, the angular expansion hypothesis provides accounts for {{a broader range of}} spatial biases...|$|R
