5000|$|Hikone Mizuya-dansu: Although mizuya (kitchen chests) both of {{a single}} section and chest on chest {{configuration}} have been crafted to fit into or adjacent to home kitchen alcoves {{since at least the}} mid Edo Period, the mizuya produced in the town of Hikone on Lake Biwa in Shiga Prefecture deserve particular note. Though copied from Nagoya to Kyoto, the Hikone design, as a uniting of house storage needs and traditional architecture based upon the shaku measurement as standardized in 1891 is to be praised. Using mortise and tenon construction with Hinoki for primary framing, craftsmen cleverly lightened the visual mass of the case by using kijiro nuri (translucent lacquered) finishing for the door and <b>drawer</b> <b>face</b> woods. For the hardware, copper rather than iron was preferred.|$|E

5000|$|The primary {{technique}} starts by cutting the main {{shape of the}} box. Then a 1/8" [...] to 1/4" [...] piece of wood is cut off what is to become the back. The drawer shape is cut within the main shape, which involves cutting through the main body, and the body must be glued back together. Once the drawer shape is cut, the usual technique is to remove 1/8" [...] to 1/4" [...] of material from both {{the front and rear}} of the drawer shape to be used as faces. The remaining stock is then reduced or hollowed out to produce a drawer or cavity. The front and rear <b>drawer</b> <b>faces</b> are glued back to the remaining hollowed drawer stock, and the back that was cut off is glued to the main body. A handle can be added {{to the front of the}} drawer if desired.|$|R
5000|$|Sakai Choba-dansu: Though land-locked now for centuries, Sakai {{is still}} {{thought of as}} the [...] "port town" [...] for the city of Osaka. The {{merchant}} chest design associated with Sakai successfully diffused throughout Japan. Highest quality Sakai Choba are constructed of [...] "unfinished" [...] Hinoki for <b>drawer</b> and door <b>face</b> woods with Sugi for the case. Compartment proportionality, though intricate, is most always visually pleasing.|$|R
5000|$|Seven {{years after}} {{attending}} an exhibition in Durham, Kilbourn considered creating a visual memoir of his experiences, [...] "starting as a pom-pom {{boy on the}} compressed air coal-cutting machines in 1917, going on to be a putter-lad, a coal <b>face</b> <b>drawer,</b> a salvage drawer and a wasteman." [...] During development of his project, [...] "the memories were directed into detailed narrative." [...] 'My Life as a Pitman' became an exhibition in 1977 and was considered as a [...] "North Country counterpart to the colourful rural Chinese scenes." ...|$|R
5000|$|... " ....We ascended {{in an open}} iron-work {{elevator}} to an upper floor and I was let into 3-A. A living room had tall old windows overlooking Jermyn Street. Dark antique furniture: A sideboard, a desk, a chest of <b>drawers,</b> a sofa <b>facing</b> the fireplace, two low easy chairs, tall mirrors above the fire and the sideboard. He used a wooden match to light the gas under artificial logs.A hall led to a bedroom in which space had been found for two single beds, a bedside table between them, an armoire, a chest, a small vanity table and another gas fireplace. In the bathroom was enthroned the largest bathtub I had ever seen, even in the movies. The fixtures were not modern; the water closet had an overhead tank with a pull-chain. [...] "This is larger than I expected," [...] I said. [...] "How many rooms {{do you have in}} all?" [...] "Sixteen."....For 25 years I was to come here to Jermyn Street time and again. Now I can never return. Some obscene architectural extrusion will rise upon the sacred land, some eyesore of retail and condos and trendy dining. Piece by piece, this is how a city dies. How many cities can spare a hotel built in 1685, the year James II took the crown?I will barely be able to bring myself to return Jermyn Street, which is, shop for shop, the finest street in London. When I approach it again I will have to enter from Piccadilly by walking down through the Piccadilly Arcade and not from Lower Regent Street. I can still attend a lunchtime concert at St. James, or call in at Turnbull & Asser the haberdashers, Paxton and Whitfield the cheese mongers, Wilton's the restaurant, and Waterstone's the book store...but I cannot and will not ever again walk past 22 Jermyn Street. The address itself will be dead. [...] " [...] - American film critic Roger Ebert on 22 Jermyn Street.|$|R
5000|$|Cabinet {{frames and}} doors may be {{fashioned}} from solid wood (typically {{a species of}} hardwood), medium density fiberboard (MDF), particle board, plywood, or a combination, and may include lamination or a surface coating over these core materials. A floating panel in a door can be hardwood-veneer plywood captured within a solid wood or MDF frame. Solid wood and MDF can be edge-shaped, e.g., to round or pattern the edges of doors, <b>drawer</b> fronts, or <b>face</b> frames. Particle board, once manufactured, cannot be edge-shaped suitably. Plywood cannot be shaped without revealing its veneer core, often considered unsightly, though edge-shaped furniture-grade plywood with thin plies 1/16 in is considered attractive for limited uses. MDF, once shaped, can be coated conformally with flexible veneers such as thermofoil or can be painted. It can also be covered with wood veneer or high-pressure laminate {{but only if the}} edge profile is square or approximately so (to within the veneer thickness). Today many cabinet doors and drawer fronts utilize an MDF core. Doors and drawer fronts may also be fashioned of particle board surfaced with high-pressure laminate. Natural wood offers its subtle combination of color, grain, pore pattern, variable absorption and smoothness of finish, and variation with viewing angle and lighting condition. The appearance of natural wood can only be achieved with solid wood components (wherever edges are shaped) or possibly veneer (where they are not); as already pointed out, the two approaches can be combined in a single cabinet. Various transparent grain-revealing finishes including shellac, lacquer, varnish, or polyurethane have been devised. A built-up finish may optionally utilize diverse pigments, dyes, bleaches, glazes, or wood fillers that may highlight contrasting colorants. Finishes can be applied by brush or spray and may comprise many separately applied layers. Accordingly, finishes formulated by differing manufacturers do not, in general, exactly match. Distressing the wood cabinets is another finish application and is often done in conjunction with glazes, stains, paints or dyes. This process consists of adding manufactured imperfections to cabinet doors to give the wood cabinets an aged, distressed, old-world rustic appearance. Common techniques include creating wormholes, rasping, dings and dents and sanding through the wood and layers of finish unevenly.|$|R
