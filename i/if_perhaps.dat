5|$|When Marseille {{returned}} to his unit he asked his friends Franzisket, Clade and Schröer, whether they had heard {{what was happening to}} Jews and <b>if</b> <b>perhaps</b> something was underway {{that they did not know}} about. Franszisket recalled that he had heard Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East but no more. Marseille recounted how he had attempted to ask questions about Jews who had vanished from his neighbourhood, including the family doctor that had delivered him at birth. Regardless of his hero status, when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him, his enquiries were either met with awkward silences, or people changed the subject or even turned away. Franzisket noticed a change in Marseille's attitude toward his nation's cause. He never spoke of this with his comrades again.|$|E
25|$|During the Great Sejm Suchorzewski was {{at first}} a {{supporter}} of the Patriotic Party; in particular he supported the enlargement of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's army. In 1789 he published a brochure on the cities and law (Basics of urban laws - Zasady praw miejskich). However, he eventually switched sides and joined the Hetman Party opposed to the reforms. Around 18 January 1791 he criticized the recently premiered The Return of the Deputy (Powrót posła) comedy of Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz for its political content; his critique was not well received and he was ridiculed for it, losing prestige. Despite his opposition of many reforms, he nonetheless played a major, <b>if</b> <b>perhaps</b> not necessarily intentional, role in the passage of the Free Royal Cities Act in April 1791, as his rather unexpected involvement in the discussion boosted the supporters of the act and eased its passing. For that, the king rewarded him with the Order of Saint Stanislaus.|$|E

500|$|The seven-track live {{record was}} {{recorded}} {{in front of a}} room full of people in New York City in the autumn of 1984. It has been rumored that the crowd noise was added in a studio rather than recorded on stage. Joel McIver, author of The Bloody Reign of Slayer, asked Live Undead producer/engineer Bill Metoyer, who had worked on the album in Los Angeles. Metoyer responded: [...] "I don't know if I should tell you ! Isn't that one of those great industry secrets? Let's just say that when you're doing a live record, you want live sound — even <b>if</b> <b>perhaps</b> the microphones didn't pick up the audience properly." ...|$|E

[...] I think it is simply {{that it is so}} likable. [...] So new, so fresh, and so unassuming, even in its pretensions." [...] John J. O'Connor of The Wall Street Journal said the show was [...] "exuberantly defiant and the production explodes into every nook and cranny of the Biltmore Theater". Richard Watts Jr. of the New York Post wrote that [...] "it has a surprising <b>if</b> <b>perhaps</b> unintentional charm, its high spirits are contagious, and its young zestfulness makes it difficult to resist." ...|$|E

500|$|The emperor {{employed}} {{several men}} {{who claimed to}} be able to produce elixirs of immortality or who could communicate with spiritual beings. [...] Shaoweng, the court mystic who preceded Luan Da and had studied under the same teacher, performed a ritual that was exposed to be a fraud. [...] Embarrassed that he had been tricked, the emperor ordered Shaoweng's execution and kept quiet about the affair. Shaoweng purportedly died from consuming horse liver, which was thought to be poisonous at the time. Later, Emperor Wu reconsidered Shaoweng's fraud, wondering <b>if</b> <b>perhaps</b> some of his mystical arts had been genuine. The emperor realized that his chance for immortality might have passed with Shaoweng's execution, and began to search for a new mystic.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Rita {{has been well}} received by critics, who praised Benz’s portrayal. Eric Goldman of IGN has said, “Dexter does a solid job of developing {{the roles of the}} supporting cast, with Rita, Deb, Doakes and LaGuerta all getting a good amount of development”. [...] He added, “There were a couple of forced moments in [...] "Popping Cherry", most notably the drug dealer who came to Rita's house, in broad daylight, demanding money for her ex-husband's debts; it was all a bit over the top and cliché. On the other hand, it was interesting to note Dexter's inaction in that scene, making one wonder <b>if</b> <b>perhaps</b> he fears that any public display of physical defense, even for Rita, might result in him going too far and revealing what he is." [...] Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post has said, [...] "Rita always felt like the light in that dark show", and [...] "In the beginning Rita was the vessel through which the audience could love Dexter." [...] UGO.com placed Rita Bennett 7th on a list of [...] "Top 11 Girlfriends on TV". Zap2it created a poll entitled [...] "Best Mom" [...] as part of their [...] "Greatest TV Characters" [...] series of polls; Rita was voted 12th on a list of 14 characters.|$|E

2500|$|Reading {{the report}} of Tamar in [...] "She sat in the gate of Enaim," [...] Rabbi Alexander taught that Tamar went {{and sat at the}} {{entrance}} of the place of Abraham, the place to which all eyes ( [...] , einaim) look. Alternatively, Rav Hanin said in the name of Rav that there is a place called Enaim, and it is the same place mentioned in [...] when it speaks of [...] "Tappuah and Enam." [...] Alternatively, Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani taught that the place is called Enaim because Tamar gave eyes ( [...] , einaim) to her words; that is, Tamar gave convincing replies to Judah's questions. When Judah solicited her, he asked her if she was a Gentile, and she replied that she was a convert. When Judah asked her if she was a married woman, she replied that she was unmarried. When Judah asked her <b>if</b> <b>perhaps</b> her father had accepted marriage proposals on her behalf betrothals (making her forbidden to Judah), she replied that she was an orphan. When Judah asked her <b>if</b> <b>perhaps</b> she was ritually unclean (because she was a menstruant, or niddah, and thus forbidden to Judah), she replied that she was clean..|$|E

2500|$|In {{defining}} Morrison’s {{texts as}} African-American literature, critics {{have become more}} attentive to historical and social context and to the way Morrison’s fiction engages with specific places and moments in time. As Jennings observes, many of Morrison’s novels are set in isolated black communities where African practices and belief systems are not marginalized by a dominant white culture but rather remain active, <b>if</b> <b>perhaps</b> subconscious, forces shaping the community. Matus comments that Morrison’s later novels [...] "have been even more thoroughly focused on specific historical moments"; [...] "through their engagement {{with the history of}} slavery and early twentieth-century Harlem, [...] have imagined and memorialized aspects of black history that have been forgotten or inadequately remembered".|$|E

USA Today described Boam as [...] "low-key", and The New York Times called him [...] "a polite, soft-spoken family man {{without a trace of}} the frenzied energy of his films." [...] Film critic Christopher Hicks said that Boam could be unusually candid, but that [...] "Boam is simply Boam [...] a reclusive writer rather than a celebrity worried about his image.

2500|$|Stanford {{spent much}} of 1972 {{traveling}} through the South and New England with Broughton, a communications teacher and filmmaker. Together, the two interviewed and filmed poets/writers Richard Eberhart, Malcolm Cowley, and John Crowe Ransom. (These interviews appear in The Writer’s Mind: Interviews With American Authors, a three-volume set.) Broughton tutored Stanford in {{the technical aspects of}} camera work, and the poet developed an interest in filmmaking. Moreover, he briefly lived in New York City, <b>if</b> <b>perhaps</b> for merely a few weeks, but only, he would later write, [...] "to go to the movies." [...] Returning to Arkansas from New York, he moved to the old spa town of Eureka Springs and took a room in the New Orleans Hotel.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1770s, {{smallpox}} (variola major) eradicated {{at least}} 30 {{percent of the}} indigenous population on the Northwest coast of North America, including many Squamish.
