Nicholas Whyte of the website Northern Ireland Access Research Knowledge (ARK) wrote, [...] "For general information about political parties in Northern Ireland since 1922, the whole of Ireland 1801–1922, England, Scotland, and Wales, <b>I</b> <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> get hold of Politico's Guide to the History of British Political Parties by David Boothroyd available from Politico's." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 28, 2009, the Liberals {{agreed to}} support the Conservative budget with an amendment, ending the {{possibility}} of the coalition, so Layton said [...] "Today we have learned that you can't trust Mr. Ignatieff to oppose Mr. Harper. If you oppose Mr. Harper and you want a new government, <b>I</b> <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> support the NDP." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{coming to}} office, Prescott pursued an {{integrated}} public transport policy. On 6 June 1997, he said: [...] "I will have failed if {{in five years}} time there are not...far fewer journeys by car. It's a tall order but <b>I</b> <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> hold me to it." [...] However, by June 2002, car traffic was up by 7%. This prompted Friends of the Earth's Tony Bosworth to say [...] "By its own test, Government transport policy has failed".|$|E

"Don't you {{remember}} that, in Rome, <b>you</b> wished <b>to</b> break your engagement, and that <b>I</b> <b>urged</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> respect it, though {{it seemed to}} hang by so slender a thread? I wished <b>you</b> <b>to</b> see what would come of it? If I am not mistaken, <b>you</b> are reconciled <b>to</b> it." ...|$|R
2500|$|President Obama {{endorsed}} Cohen on April 5, 2012, saying “Congressman Steve Cohen {{has worked}} with me on jobs bills, health care, and other issues of importance to the middle class. He also never fails to pitch me on the city of Memphis, whether it’s Booker T. Washington High School, Memphis basketball, or barbecue. <b>I</b> <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> vote for Steve Cohen, a tireless advocate for the 9th District". [...] In the general election, Cohen trounced Republican businessman George Flinn with 75 percent of the vote.|$|E
2500|$|... "Spotted Tail, {{you are a}} {{remarkable}} man. [...] You are such an able man {{that you are the}} principal chief of these thousands of your people. But Spotted Tail, you cannot read or write. You claim that the government has tricked your people and placed the lines of your reservation a long way inside of where it was agreed that they should be. [...] You signed that paper, knowing only what the interpreter told you it said. If anything happened when the paper was being made up that changed its order, if you had been educated and could read and write, you could have known about it and refused to put your name on it. Do you intend to let your children remain in the same condition of ignorance in which you have lived, which will compel them always to meet the whiter man at a great disadvantage through an interpreter, as you have to do? [...] As your friend, Spotted Tail, <b>I</b> <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> send your children with me to this Carlisle School and I will do everything I can to advance them in intelligence and industry in order that they may come back and help you." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{established}} and successful songwriters Flanders and Swann {{were invited to}} lecture on their craft at Dartington International Summer School [...] in 1956. Flanders found that his spoken introductions were as well received by the audience as the songs themselves. He and Swann decided to give a show along similar lines in London. They took the New Lindsey Theatre for a limited three-week run; the New Lindsey, holding about 150 people, was situated outside the London West End theatre district. The show opened on 31 December 1956. The press notices were good, the box-office did excellent business, and the pair were offered a West End transfer. Swann recalled in 1977, [...] "We turned it down unanimously. It seemed to spell the end of Michael's radio career (he had by that time done at least a thousand broadcasts) {{and the end of}} Swann as composer." [...] After each had spent two or three sleepless nights worrying, they reconsidered; the show transferred to the Fortune Theatre in Covent Garden on 24 January 1957, where, according to The Times, [...] "it took the audience by storm". The critic J. C. Trewin wrote, [...] "I feel that even [...] Gilbert might have applauded the intricate neatness of their numbers. … <b>I</b> <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> hear Mr Flanders as he explains the precise derivation of 'Greensleeves'." [...] The show ran for 808 performances at the Fortune, until 2 May 1959.|$|E

Then <b>I</b> <b>urged</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go, and now I feel I ought not to urge. To be generous in my way costs one nothing. I shall not venture on the rocks; I send you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean," [...] he said, {{returning}} his friend's anxious {{look with}} {{one that was}} inspiring in its unshakable confidence, [...] "I mean that on Monday last, the night before your wedding--when <b>I</b> <b>urged</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> obtain Yvonne de Kernogan's consent to an immediate marriage--I had followed Martin-Roget to a place called [...] "The Bottom Inn" [...] on Goblin Combe--a place well known to every smuggler in the county." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I hate you, Hokosa, and yet {{can strike}} you only through my tongue and your mad love for me. I am fast in your power, but thus at least I {{can make you}} feel {{something}} of my own pain. Hark! I hear that woman at the gate. Will you give her back the basket, or will you not? Whatever <b>you</b> may choose <b>to</b> do, do not say in after days that <b>I</b> <b>urged</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> the deed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} your grief, Don Antonio," [...] he said. [...] "Believe me, I feel for you--so much that <b>I</b> <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> set {{an end to}} the captivity of those dear ones who are innocent, who are suffering for your sake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jimmy gravely; [...] "I {{am afraid}} you must choose to-night. You {{know how much}} I want you, but I have sense enough to {{recognize}} that I may bring trouble on both of us if <b>I</b> <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do what you might afterward regret." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am hardly {{in danger}} of doing that. It is because I {{remember}} it that <b>I</b> <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> change your estate with all dispatch; and cease to be the Marquise de Condillac. That same Marquise has a heavy score against her. Let her evade payment by this metamorphosis. I have opened for you, madame, a door through which you may escape." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mercy, {{how you do}} abuse your fine profession! I'm sure <b>I</b> never <b>urged</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> adopt it!" [...] Mrs. Rooth cried, in real bewilderment, to her daughter.|$|R
6000|$|Again Eliza fixed a musing {{look upon}} her. [...] "I reckon {{if the truth}} was known your aunt Celia was nigher to being your mother than I ever was. They always said you was all Wetherford, and I reckon they were right. I always liked men better than babies. So long as I had your father, you didn't count--now that's the God's truth. And I didn't intend that you should ever come back here. <b>I</b> <b>urged</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> stay--you know that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If it is <b>I</b> would <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{call the}} case against George {{at the same time}} as that against Bob, for I know, beyond a doubt, that he will be proven not guilty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The other Council Members are {{on their}} way. They have already been {{notified}} and are coming {{as quickly as they}} can. Again <b>I</b> <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go back down." [...] The leady surveyed the three human beings. [...] "There is no way you can meet the conditions up here. Even we survive with some trouble, ourselves. How can you expect to do it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tut, tut, Mr. Philander," [...] he chided. [...] "How often must <b>I</b> <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> seek that {{absolute}} {{concentration of}} your mental faculties which alone may permit {{you to bring}} to bear the highest powers of intellectuality upon the momentous problems which naturally fall to the lot of great minds? And now I find you guilty of a most flagrant breach of courtesy in interrupting my learned discourse {{to call attention to}} a mere quadruped of the genus FELIS. As I was saying, Mr.--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, <b>I</b> <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> come, {{because there}} is health for Molly to be found on these sunny slopes of this grand Backbone of America. That is my strongest point. If that does not move you, nothing else will! One glance from the windows of my wooden house--this Eagle's Nest on the Rocky Mountain Slopes--would be {{sufficient}} to begin the work of convalescence. Woods, dells, knolls, hills, plains, prairies, lakes, streams--with the blue mountains in the far, far distance. Oh! if I were a poet, what a flight I would make into the realms of--of--well, you understand me! I have no time for more. The big-bearded postboy is growing impatient. Only this much will I add,--do, do come, if you love me. My kindest love to you all. May God guide you in this matter.--Your affectionate son, JIM.|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy's laugh was scornful. [...] "My uncles {{control my}} fortune {{for a year}} or two; that's all. However, if <b>you</b> hesitate, <b>I</b> won't <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> marry me yet. If <b>you</b> engage <b>to</b> do so when I get my inheritance, I'll be satisfied." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know well}} who I am, and what I am, and that I love you. You say I {{will not help}} you; but your heart knows the contrary. It is you who will not help me; for you will not {{tell me what you}} want. You see--or you could see, if you took the pains to look--how I have waited here all night to be ready at your service. I only asked information; <b>I</b> only <b>urged</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> consider; and <b>I</b> still <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> think better of your fancies. But if your mind is made up, so be it; I will beg no longer; I will give you my orders; and I will not allow--not allow <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go hence alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And don't be angry," [...] added Petroff, in {{a gentle}} tone, as he {{tightened}} his belt, [...] "if <b>I</b> again <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> keep the locket always in remembrance. You're not likely ever to forget the auburn hair, but you may, lad, you may, for there is no perfection in this world, and soldiering is a dangerous life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I'm running on. I want to know, Stephen, why you've {{got nothing}} to say about all this. It must have been staring you in the face ever since I spent my very {{considerable}} superfluous energies in wrecking your career. Because you know I wrecked it, Stephen. I knew I was wrecking it and I wrecked it. I knew exactly what I was doing all the time. I had meant to be so fine a thing for you, a mothering friend, to have that dear consecutive kindly mind of yours steadying mine, to have seen you grow to power over men, me helping, me admiring. It was to have been so fine. So fine! Didn't <b>I</b> <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> marry Rachel, make you talk of her. Don't you remember that? And one day when I saw you thinking of Rachel, saw a kind of pride in your eyes!--suddenly I couldn't stand it. I went to my room after you had gone and thought of you and her until I wanted to scream. I couldn't bear it. It was intolerable. I was violent to my toilet things. I broke a hand-glass. Your dignified, selfish, self-controlled Mary smashed a silver hand-mirror. I never told you that. You know what followed. I pounced on you and took you. Wasn't I--a soft and scented hawk? Was either of us better than some creature of instinct that does what it does because it must? It was like a gust of madness--and I cared, I found, no more for your career than I cared for any other little thing, for honor, for Rachel, for Justin, that stood between us....|$|E
6000|$|You fancy {{that you}} care to know this: so little do you care that, probably, at this moment {{many of you are}} displeased with me for talking of the matter! You came to hear about the Art of this world, not about the Life of the next, and you are {{provoked}} with me for talking of what you can hear any Sunday in church. But do not be afraid. I will tell you something before you go about pictures, and carvings, and pottery, and what else you would like better to hear of than the other world. Nay, perhaps you say, [...] "We want you to talk of pictures and pottery, because we are sure that you know something of them, and you know nothing of the other world." [...] Well-- I don't. That is quite true. But the very strangeness and mystery of which <b>I</b> <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> take notice, is in this--that I do not;--nor you either. Can you answer a single bold question unflinchingly about that other world?--Are you sure there is a heaven? Sure there is a hell? Sure that men are dropping before your faces through the pavements of these streets into eternal fire, or sure that they are not? Sure that at your own death {{you are going to be}} delivered from all sorrow, to be endowed with all virtue, to be gifted with all felicity, and raised into perpetual companionship with a King, compared to whom the kings of the earth are as grass-hoppers, and the nations as the dust of His feet? Are you sure of this? or, if not sure, do any of us so much as care to make it sure? and, if not, how can anything that we do be right--how can anything we think be wise? what honour can there be in the arts that amuse us, or what profit in the possessions that please? ...|$|E

"If {{she leaves}} the house at once," [...] the doctor replied, [...] "she may escape the infamy of being charged with an attempt at murder by poison; and, in her absence, I can answer for Philip's life. <b>I</b> don't <b>urge</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> warn her, because {{that might be a}} {{dangerous}} thing to do.
