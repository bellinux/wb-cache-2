5|$|National {{consistency}} of governance. In 1978 the Northern Territory achieved self-government. The ACT {{was the only}} other mainland territory, with a population greater than that of the Northern Territory that was growing faster, so it was suggested that if self-government was appropriate for the Northern Territory, then <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> appropriate for the ACT.|$|E

Reviewing the body, Kay {{realizes that}} the shark that killed him is the first shark's mother, and that <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> inside the park. She is able to {{convince}} Calvin about this newest development when the shark herself {{shows up at the}} window of the underwater cafe. Flushed out from her refuge inside a filtration pipe, the shark begins to wreak havoc on the park, injures a water skier, and causes a leak that nearly drowns everyone in the underwater tunnel. FitzRoyce and his assistant, Jack, go down to the filtration pipe in an attempt to lure the shark back in as a trap. FitzRoyce leads the shark into the pipe, but is then attacked and killed.|$|E
5|$|The ICSID {{does not}} conduct {{arbitration}} or conciliation proceedings itself, but offers institutional and procedural support to conciliation commissions, tribunals, and other committees which conduct such matters. The center has {{two sets of}} rules that determine how cases will be initiated and conducted, either under the ICSID's Convention, Regulations and Rules or the ICSID's Additional Facility Rules. To be processed {{in accordance with the}} ICSID Convention, a legal dispute has to exist between one of the center's contracting member states and a national of another contracting member state. <b>It</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> of a legal nature and relate directly to an investment. A case can be processed under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules if one of the parties to the dispute is either not a contracting member state or a national of a contracting member state. However, most cases are arbitrated under the ICSID Convention. Recourse to ICSID conciliation and arbitration is entirely voluntary. However, once the parties have consented to arbitration under the ICSID Convention, neither party can unilaterally withdraw its consent.|$|E

50|$|Protestants do however, {{approve of}} {{masturbation}} unlike Roman Catholics, {{due to the}} lack of a Biblical injunction against the act.

This produces many instances of nodes in network A that depend on multiple coupled nodes in network B. Failure propagation between networks follows the same rule for both one-to-one and many-to-one mappings: for each network node to operate, all of the nodes upon which <b>it</b> depends <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> operational.|$|R

25|$|The {{method of}} {{infinite}} descent {{was one of}} Pierre de Fermat's favorites. This method of proof can assume several slightly different forms.

Using mathematical induction (implicitly) with the inductive hypothesis being that the statement is false for all natural numbers {{less than or equal}} to m, one may conclude that the statement cannot be true for any natural number n.|$|E
25|$|This {{description}} has {{similarities to}} the older account by Adam of Bremen but the differences are interesting. Adam assigns control of the weather and produce of the fields to Thor but Snorri says that Freyr rules over those areas. Snorri also omits any explicitly sexual references in Freyr's description. Those discrepancies can be explained in several ways. It {{is possible that the}} Norse gods did not have exactly the same roles in Icelandic and Swedish paganism but <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> remembered that Adam and Snorri were writing with different goals in mind. Either Snorri or Adam may also have had distorted information.|$|E

It found that, although certain employees are not recognised as such {{for the purposes of}} the LRA, the constitutional right to fair labour practices is nevertheless applicable to them, and that the common-law contract of employment now includes protection against constructive dismissal. The employee had a contractual right not to be dismissed. It was also held that, for a successful claim based on constructive dismissal, the employer must not only be responsible for the circumstances which induce the employee to resign; <b>it</b> <b>must</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> to blame for those circumstances.|$|E
