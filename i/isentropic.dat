25|$|NOTE: The <b>isentropic</b> {{assumptions}} are only applicable with ideal cycles. Real world cycles have inherent losses due to inefficient compressors and turbines. The real world system are not truly <b>isentropic</b> but are rather idealized as <b>isentropic</b> for calculation purposes.|$|E
25|$|An {{adiabatic}} {{storage system}} does {{away with the}} intercooling during the compression process, and simply allows the gas to heat up during compression, and likewise to cool down during expansion. This is attractive, since the energy losses associated with the heat transfer are avoided, but {{the downside is that}} the storage vessel must be insulated against heat loss. It should also be mentioned that real compressors and turbines are not <b>isentropic,</b> but instead have an <b>isentropic</b> efficiency of around 85%, with the result that round-trip storage efficiency for adiabatic systems is also considerably less than perfect.|$|E
25|$|If the {{expansion}} process is reversible, {{meaning that the}} gas is in thermodynamic equilibrium at all times, it is called an <b>isentropic</b> expansion. In this scenario, the gas does positive work during {{the expansion}}, and its temperature decreases.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} achieve a near {{thermodynamic}} reversible process so {{that most of the}} energy is saved in the system and can be retrieved, and losses are kept negligible, a near reversible isothermal process or an <b>isentropic</b> process is desired.|$|E
25|$|Across the {{expansion}} fan, the flow accelerates (velocity increases) and the Mach number increases, while the static pressure, temperature and density decrease. Since {{the process is}} <b>isentropic,</b> the stagnation properties (e.g. total pressure and total temperature) remain constant across the fan.|$|E
25|$|A Pumped Heat Electricity Storage {{system uses}} a highly {{reversible}} heat engine/heat pump to pump heat between two storage vessels, heating one and cooling the other. The UK-based engineering company <b>Isentropic</b> that is developing the system claims a potential electricity-in to electricity-out round-trip efficiency of 72–80%.|$|E
25|$|An {{adiabatic}} process {{is one where}} there is no heat transfer between the fluid and the surroundings: the system is insulated against heat transfer. If the process is furthermore internally reversible (smooth, slow and frictionless, to the ideal limit) then it will additionally be <b>isentropic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Taking {{into account}} the {{established}} assumptions, in a system where the downstream properties are becoming subsonic: the upstream and downstream flow properties of the fluid are considered <b>isentropic.</b> Since {{the total amount of}} energy within the system is constant, the stagnation enthalpy remains constant over both regions. Though, entropy is increasing; this must be accounted for by a drop in stagnation pressure of the downstream fluid.|$|E
25|$|Goddard {{described}} extensive {{experiments with}} solid-fuel rocket engines burning high grade nitrocellulose smokeless powder. A critical breakthrough {{was the use}} of the steam turbine nozzle invented by the Swedish inventor Gustaf de Laval. The de Laval nozzle allows the most efficient (<b>isentropic)</b> conversion of the energy of hot gases into forward motion. By means of this nozzle, Goddard increased the efficiency of his rocket engines from 2 percent to 64 percent and obtained supersonic exhaust velocities of over Mach 7.|$|E
25|$|The next {{feature to}} be {{discussed}} is the oval shaped curves representing islands of constant efficiency. In this figure we see 11 contours ranging from 56% efficiency (decimal 0.56) to 76% efficiency (decimal 0.76). General standard practice is to interpret these efficiencies as <b>isentropic</b> rather than polytropic. The inclusion of efficiency islands effectively generates a 3-dimensional topology to this 2-dimensional map. With inlet density specified, it provides a further ability to calculate aerodynamic power. Lines of constant power {{could just as easily}} be substituted.|$|E
25|$|Energy storage systems {{often use}} large {{underground}} caverns. This {{is the preferred}} system design, due to the very large volume, and thus the large quantity of energy that can be stored with only a small pressure change. The cavern space can be easily insulated, compressed adiabatically with little temperature change (approaching a reversible isothermal system) and heat loss (approaching an <b>isentropic</b> system). This advantage is {{in addition to the}} low cost of constructing the gas storage system, using the underground walls to assist in containing the pressure.|$|E
25|$|The ideal Otto and Diesel cycles are {{not totally}} {{reversible}} because they involve heat transfer through a finite temperature difference during the irreversible isothermal heat-addition and heat-rejection processes. The irreversibility renders the thermal efficiency of these cycles {{less than that}} of a Carnot engine operating within the same limits of temperature. Another cycle that features isothermal heat-addition and heat-rejection processes is the Stirling cycle, which is an altered version of the Carnot cycle in which the two <b>isentropic</b> processes featured in the Carnot cycle are replaced by two constant-volume regeneration processes.|$|E
25|$|The {{shock wave}} {{is one of}} several {{different}} ways in which a gas in a supersonic flow can be compressed. Some other methods are <b>isentropic</b> compressions, including Prandtl-Meyer compressions. The method of compression of a gas results in different temperatures and densities for a given pressure ratio which can be analytically calculated for a non-reacting gas. A shock wave compression results in a loss of total pressure, meaning that it is a less efficient method of compressing gases for some purposes, for instance in the intake of a scramjet. The appearance of pressure-drag on supersonic aircraft is mostly due to the effect of shock compression on the flow.|$|E
25|$|Supersonic {{pressure}} recovery is {{addressed by the}} number of shock waves that are generated by the intake, the greater the number the higher the {{pressure recovery}}. Supersonic flow is compressed or slowed by changes in direction. The Concorde intake front ramps changed the flow direction causing oblique external shocks and <b>isentropic</b> compression in the supersonic flow. The TSR-2 had used a half-cone translating centre-body to change the direction. Subsonic pressure recovery is addressed by removal of the boundary layer (at the ramp bleed slot) and suitable shaping of the subsonic diffuser leading to the engine. The high pressure recovery for the Concorde intake at cruise gave an intake pressure ratio of 7.3:1.|$|E
500|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone's {{primary energy}} source is heat from the evaporation {{of water from the}} ocean surface, which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when the warm moist air rises and cools to saturation. The energetics of the system may be idealized as an atmospheric Carnot heat engine. First, inflowing air near the surface acquires heat primarily via evaporation of water (i.e. latent heat) at the temperature of the warm ocean surface (during evaporation, the ocean cools and the air warms). Second, the warmed air rises and cools within the eyewall while conserving total heat content (latent heat is simply converted to sensible heat during condensation). Third, air outflows and loses heat via infrared radiation to space at the temperature of the cold tropopause. Finally, air subsides and warms at {{the outer edge of the}} storm while conserving total heat content. [...] The first and third legs are nearly isothermal, while the second and fourth legs are nearly <b>isentropic.</b> This in-up-out-down overturning flow is known as the secondary circulation. [...] The Carnot perspective provides an upper bound on the maximum wind speed that a storm can attain.|$|E

One common way of cooling the gas during compression is to use cooling jackets around the casing of the compressor.|$|E
2500|$|The Fanno flow {{model is}} often used {{in the design and}} {{analysis}} of nozzles. [...] In a nozzle, the converging or diverging area is modeled with <b>isentropic</b> flow, while the constant area section afterwards is modeled with Fanno flow. [...] For given upstream conditions at point 1 as shown in Figures 3 and 4, calculations can be made to determine the nozzle exit Mach number and the location of a normal shock in the constant area duct. [...] Point 2 labels the nozzle throat, where M= 1 if the flow is choked. [...] Point 3 labels the end of the nozzle where the flow transitions from <b>isentropic</b> to Fanno. [...] With a high enough initial pressure, supersonic flow can be maintained through the constant area duct, similar to the desired performance of a blowdown-type supersonic wind tunnel. [...] However, these figures show the shock wave before it has moved entirely through the duct. [...] If a shock wave is present, the flow transitions from the supersonic portion of the Fanno line to the subsonic portion before continuing towards M= 1. [...] The movement in Figure 4 is always from the left to the right in order to satisfy the second law of thermodynamics.|$|E
2500|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{is an example}} of a non-equilibrium system. Atmospheric thermodynamics describes the effect of buoyant forces that cause the rise of less dense (warmer) air, the descent of more dense air, and the transformation of water from liquid to vapor (evaporation) and its condensation. Those dynamics are modified by the force of the pressure gradient and that motion is modified by the Coriolis force. [...] The tools used include the law of energy conservation, the ideal gas law, specific heat capacities, the assumption of <b>isentropic</b> processes (in which entropy is a constant), and moist adiabatic processes (during which no energy is transferred as heat). Most of tropospheric gases are treated as ideal gases and water vapor, with its ability to change phase from vapor, to liquid, to solid, and back is considered as one of the most important trace components of air.|$|E
2500|$|While {{illustrating}} a gas turbine's Brayton cycle, Figure 5.1 [...] includes example {{plots of}} [...] pressure-specific volume and temperature-entropy. These types of plots are fundamental to understanding centrifugal compressor performance at one operating point. Studying these two plots further {{we see that}} the pressure rises between the compressor inlet (station 1) and compressor exit (station 2). [...] At the same time, {{it is easy to see}} that the specific volume decreases or similarly the density increases. Studying the temperature-entropy plot we see the temperature increase with increasing entropy (loss). If we assume dry air, and ideal gas equation of state and an <b>isentropic</b> process, we have enough information to define the pressure ratio and efficiency for this one point. Unfortunately, we are missing several other key pieces of information if we wish to apply the centrifugal compressor to another application.|$|E
2500|$|The turbine {{efficiency}} of the gas Tesla turbine {{is estimated to be}} above 60, reaching a maximum of 95 percent [...] Keep in mind that {{turbine efficiency}} is different from the cycle {{efficiency of the}} engine using the turbine. Axial turbines which operate today in steam plants or jet engines have efficiencies of about 60–70% (Siemens Turbines Data). This is different from the cycle efficiencies of the plant or engine which are between approximately 25% and 42%, and are limited by any irreversibilities to be below the Carnot cycle efficiency. Tesla claimed that a steam version of his device would achieve around 95 percent efficiency. Actual tests of a Tesla steam turbine at the Westinghouse works showed a steam rate of 38 pounds per horsepower-hour, corresponding to a turbine efficiency in the range of 20%, while contemporary steam turbines could often achieve turbine efficiencies of well over 50%. The thermodynamic efficiency is a measure of how well it performs compared to an <b>isentropic</b> case. It is the ratio of the ideal to the actual work input/output. Turbine efficiency is defined as the ratio of the ideal change in enthalpy to the real enthalpy for the same change in pressure.|$|E
2500|$|Bernoulli's {{equation}} is sometimes valid for {{the flow of}} gases: provided {{that there is no}} transfer of kinetic or potential energy from the gas flow to the compression or expansion of the gas. [...] If both the gas pressure and volume change simultaneously, then work will be done on or by the gas. [...] In this case, Bernoulli's equation – in its incompressible flow form – cannot be assumed to be valid. [...] However, if the gas process is entirely isobaric, or isochoric, then no work is done on or by the gas, (so the simple energy balance is not upset). [...] According to the gas law, an isobaric or isochoric process is ordinarily the only way to ensure constant density in a gas. [...] Also the gas density will be proportional to the ratio of pressure and absolute temperature, however this ratio will vary upon compression or expansion, no matter what non-zero quantity of heat is added or removed. [...] The only exception is if the net heat transfer is zero, as in a complete thermodynamic cycle, or in an individual <b>isentropic</b> (frictionless adiabatic) process, and even then this reversible process must be reversed, to restore the gas to the original pressure and specific volume, and thus density. [...] Only then is the original, unmodified Bernoulli equation applicable. [...] In this case the equation can be used if the flow speed of the gas is sufficiently below the speed of sound, such that the variation in density of the gas (due to this effect) along each streamline can be ignored. [...] Adiabatic flow at less than Mach 0.3 is generally considered to be slow enough.|$|E
50|$|In fluid mechanics, a homentropic flow has {{uniform and}} {{constant}} entropy. It distinguishes itself from an <b>isentropic</b> or particle <b>isentropic</b> flow, where the entropy level of each fluid particle {{does not change}} with time, but may vary from particle to particle. This means that a homentropic flow is necessarily <b>isentropic,</b> but an <b>isentropic</b> flow need not be homentropic.|$|E
