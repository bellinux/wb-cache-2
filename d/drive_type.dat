25|$|AutoRun {{will work}} with network drives (the DRIVE_REMOTE <b>drive</b> <b>type)</b> that are mapped to a drive letter. AutoRun will also work with floppy drives that are {{provided}} with autorun-compatible drivers.|$|E
25|$|AutoRun consults Windows Registry {{values to}} decide whether to {{initiate}} actions for any particular drive or <b>drive</b> <b>type.</b> These values can be changed using several methods, one of which is using Group Policy.|$|E
25|$|AutoRun {{functionality}} {{has been}} used as a malware vector for some time. Prior to Windows Vista, the default action with a CD-ROM <b>drive</b> <b>type</b> was to follow any autorun.inf file instructions without prompts or warnings. This makes rogue CD-ROMs one possible infection vector.|$|E
50|$|ExpanDrive 3 was {{released}} on May 14, 2013 with a new user-interface and support for more <b>drive</b> <b>types</b> such as Dropbox, OpenStack, Rackspace and WebDAV.|$|R
2500|$|Failure {{rates of}} drives sold as [...] "enterprise" [...] and [...] "consumer" [...] are [...] "very much similar", {{although}} these <b>drive</b> <b>types</b> are customized for their different operating environments.|$|R
25|$|The default Registry {{settings}} on Windows versions {{prior to}} Windows XP (See NoDriveTypeAutoRun), disable Remote and Removable drives from AutoRun initiation, leaving Fixed and CDROM <b>drive</b> <b>types</b> active by default.|$|R
25|$|On Windows {{versions}} {{prior to}} Windows XP, an autorun.inf file on any <b>drive</b> <b>type</b> will be read and its instructions followed. The AutoRun task, if specified, is executed immediately without user interaction. This includes DRIVE_REMOVABLE, DRIVE_FIXED and DRIVE_REMOTE drive types.|$|E
25|$|The AutoRun layer {{initially}} consults Windows Registry {{values to}} decides whether to initiate actions for any particular drive or <b>drive</b> <b>type.</b> If AutoRun {{has been disabled}} for the newly discovered volume, then the process halts at that point, effectively disabling AutoPlay for that volume.|$|E
25|$|Versions of DOS before 3.2 totally or {{partially}} {{relied on}} the media descriptor byte in the BPB or the FAT ID byte in cluster 0 of the first FAT {{in order to determine}} FAT12 diskette formats even if a BPB is present. Depending on the FAT ID found and the <b>drive</b> <b>type</b> detected they default to use one of the following BPB prototypes instead of using the values actually stored in the BPB.|$|E
25|$|The classifications of {{rotary screw}} {{compressors}} vary based on stages, cooling methods, and <b>drive</b> <b>types</b> among others. Rotary screw compressors are commercially produced in Oil Flooded, Water Flooded and Dry type.|$|R
25|$|The default Registry {{settings}} add Removable {{drives to}} those that initiated AutoRun. In Windows XP and higher, except Windows Server 2003, only the Unknown and Remote <b>drive</b> <b>types</b> are not active for AutoRun.|$|R
2500|$|Once {{the policy}} is Enabled it can be set to [...] "All drives" [...] or [...] "CD-ROM drives". The latter setting adds CD-ROM drives to the {{existing}} list of disabled <b>drive</b> <b>types</b> as described above.|$|R
2500|$|Checks {{to see if}} AutoRun {{has been}} {{disabled}} through the Registry. If AutoRun is disabled for that drive or <b>drive</b> <b>type,</b> Explorer does not proceed further. There have been bugs in this area.|$|E
50|$|A current <b>drive</b> <b>type</b> {{availability}} list {{is maintained}} here.|$|E
5000|$|... is a [...] special. While {{investigating}} {{reports of}} counterfeit Televi-Kun magazines, Shinnosukes finds himself outmatched by a Roidmude that replicates his Kamen Rider <b>Drive</b> <b>Type</b> Speed form and overpowers him. To counter the fraud Kamen Rider, Shinnosuke has the Speed Shift Car remodeled {{to fight back}} as Kamen Rider <b>Drive</b> <b>Type</b> High Speed.|$|E
30|$|Service Storage Capabilities: CSPs do {{not offer}} the same storage capabilities. For instance, the <b>drive</b> <b>types</b> can be different. The storage process could be local or {{external}} and both has pros and cons on the performance.|$|R
50|$|Third-party DOS systems added {{features}} such as double-sided drives, subdirectories, and <b>drive</b> <b>types</b> such as 1.2 MB and 8-inch. Well-known 3rd party Atari DOS products include SmartDOS (distributed with the Rana disk drive), TopDos, MyDos and SpartaDOS.|$|R
25|$|This setting {{cannot be}} used to enable AutoRun on drives on which it is {{disabled}} by default or disable AutoRun for drives not listed. To disable or enable any particular <b>drives</b> or <b>drive</b> <b>types,</b> the Registry must be edited manually.|$|R
5000|$|... "UNLIMITED DRIVE" [...] is {{the theme}} for Kamen Rider <b>Drive</b> <b>Type</b> Tridoron.|$|E

5000|$|... "Don't {{lose your}} mind" [...] {{is the theme}} for Kamen Rider <b>Drive</b> <b>Type</b> Speed.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} {{automated}} tiered storage in a hardware storage array is a feature called Data Progression from Compellent Technologies. Data Progression has {{the capability to}} transparently move blocks of data between different <b>drive</b> <b>types</b> and RAID groups such as RAID 10 and RAID 5. The blocks {{are part of the}} [...] "same virtual volume even as they span different RAID groups and <b>drive</b> <b>types.</b> Compellent can do this because they keep metadata about every block -- which allows them to keep track of each block and its associations.". Another strong example of SAN based tiering is DotHill's Autonomous Tiered Storage which moves data between tiers of storage within the SAN disk array with decisions made every few seconds".|$|R
25|$|AutoRun may be {{suppressed}} {{on particular}} <b>drives</b> and <b>drive</b> <b>types</b> {{by using the}} methods described in the Group Policy section. However, the Group Policy Editor is not available on Home versions of Windows XP and does not provide any fine-grained drive selection facilities.|$|R
50|$|NewDos/80 {{had many}} options for specifying {{specific}} low-level disk configurations. Settings such as diskette formats, disk <b>drive</b> <b>types,</b> track geometry and controllers could be configured using the PDRIVE command. In version 2.1, Apparat added support for hard disk drives via an external bus adapter.|$|R
5000|$|On any <b>drive</b> <b>type,</b> the autorun.inf is read, parsed and {{instructions}} followed immediately and silently.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s and 1960s diesel {{locomotives}} of the 'connecting rod' with jackshaft <b>drive</b> <b>type</b> were built {{and sold to}} numerous private companies to replace steam locomotives.|$|E
50|$|A second <b>drive</b> <b>type,</b> the squiggle motor, uses {{piezoelectric}} elements bonded orthogonally to a nut. Their ultrasonic vibrations rotate {{a central}} lead screw. This {{is a direct}} drive mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|Drives do {{not support}} all {{attribute}} codes (sometimes abbreviated as [...] "ID", for [...] "identifier", in tables). Some codes are specific to particular <b>drive</b> <b>types</b> (magnetic platter, flash, SSD). Drives may use different codes for the same parameter, e.g., see codes 193 and 225.|$|R
5000|$|For all <b>drive</b> <b>types,</b> except DRIVE_CDROM, {{the only}} keys {{available}} in the &#91;autorun&#93; section are [...] and [...] Any other keys in this section will be ignored. Thus only CD and DVD media types can specify an AutoRun task or affect double-click and right-click behaviour.|$|R
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of AutoPlay in Windows XP, the final stage action (stage 7 above) for some <b>drive</b> <b>types</b> changed from executing an application to invoking AutoPlay. From Windows Vista, the AutoPlay system is integrated into every aspect of media handling {{and there is no}} automatic execution of the AutoRun task.|$|R
50|$|AutoRun {{will work}} with network drives (the DRIVE_REMOTE <b>drive</b> <b>type)</b> that are mapped to a drive letter. AutoRun will also work with floppy drives that are {{provided}} with autorun-compatible drivers.|$|E
5000|$|NO. 60: Japan's First 16mm Film Projector. Hand drive projector, {{study from}} {{imported}} model, made in 1927, and motor <b>drive</b> <b>type</b> developed in 1930 by Elmo company limited. - Aichi Prefecture ...|$|E
5000|$|The AutoRun task is {{no longer}} {{automatically}} and silently executed on any <b>drive</b> <b>type.</b> All volumes are handled by AutoPlay which, by default, will present an appropriate dialog to the user.|$|E
50|$|Floppy disk {{controllers}} {{still need}} to deal with precompensation, but since there have never been more than five or six common floppy <b>drive</b> <b>types</b> in use on PCs, all of which need the same kind of precompensation, there was never a need for a BIOS setting concerning precompensation on floppy disk drives.|$|R
40|$|Vortex flow in <b>driven</b> <b>type</b> II superconductors shows strong {{memory and}} history {{dependent}} effects. Here, we study a schematic microscopic model of driven vortices {{to propose a}} scenario for a broad set of these kind of phenomena ranging from ``rejuvenation'' and ``stiffening'' of the system response, to ``memory'' and ``irreversibility'' in I-V characteristics...|$|R
50|$|Throughout the 19th century, {{the most}} {{commonly}} used forms of screw head (that is, <b>drive</b> <b>types)</b> were simple internal-wrenching straight slots and external-wrenching squares and hexagons. These were easy to machine and served most applications adequately. Rybczynski describes a flurry of patents for alternative <b>drive</b> <b>types</b> in the 1860s through 1890s, but explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. In 1908, Canadian P. L. Robertson was the first to make the internal-wrenching square socket drive a practical reality by developing just the right design (slight taper angles and overall proportions) to allow the head to be stamped easily but successfully, with the metal cold forming as desired rather than being sheared or displaced in unwanted ways. Practical manufacture of the internal-wrenching hexagon drive (hex socket) shortly followed in 1911.|$|R
