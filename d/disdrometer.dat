While JuXPol and KiXPol were continuously observing the central HOPE area near Forschungszentrum Jülich at a close distance, BoXPol observed the area from a distance of about 48. 5  km. MRRs were deployed in the central HOPE area and one MRR close to BoXPol in Bonn, Germany. Seven <b>disdrometers</b> and three rain gauges providing point precipitation observations were deployed at five locations within a 5  km [*]×[*]  5  km region, while three other <b>disdrometers</b> were collocated with the MRR in Bonn.

The DSDs at the four sites are influenced by both oceanic and continental systems, and majority of the data matched the maritime-like DSD that was reported in a previous study. Continental-like DSDs were somewhat dominant at PT and KT. Regional {{variability of}} DSD is closely related to the variability of topography, mesoscale convective system propagation and horizontal scale of landmass.

The {{evolution of the}} storm occurred within the C-band radar coverage and moreover, several minutes prior to touch down, the storm passed over a site where several <b>disdrometers</b> including two 2 D video <b>disdrometers</b> (2 DVD) had been installed. One of the 2 DVDs is a low profile unit {{and the other is}} a new next generation compact unit currently undergoing performance evaluation. Analyses of the radar data indicate that the main region of precipitation should be treated as a "big-drop" regime case. Even the measured differential reflectivity values (i. e. without attenuation correction) were as high as 6 - 7 dB within regions of high reflectivity. Standard attenuation-correction methods using differential propagation phase have been "fine tuned" to be applicable to the "big drop" regime. The corrected reflectivity and differential reflectivity data are combined with the co-polar correlation coefficient and specific differential phase to determine the mass-weighted mean diameter, Dm, and the width of the mass spectrum, (sigma) M, as well as the intercept parameter, Nw. Significant areas of high Dm (3 - 4 mm) were retrieved within the main precipitation areas of the tornadic storm. The "big drop" regime assumption is substantiated by the two sets of 2 DVD measurements. The Dm values calculated from 1 -minute drop size distributions reached nearly 4 mm, whilst the maximum drop diameters were over 6 mm. The fall velocity measurements from the 2 DVD indicate almost all hydrometeors to be fully melted at ground level.

For this purpose collocated pairs of data were merged {{within a certain}} temporal and spatial threshold into single events, according to the satellites' overpass, the observation and the forecast times. HOAPS detects the frequency of precipitation well, while ERA-Interim strongly overestimates it, especially in the tropics and subtropics. Although precipitation rates are difficult to compare because along-track point measurements are collocated with areal estimates and the numbers of available data are limited, we find that HOAPS underestimates precipitation rates, while ERA-Interim's Atlantic-wide average precipitation rate is close to measurements. However, regionally averaged over latitudinal belts, there are deviations between the observed mean precipitation rates and ERA-Interim. The most obvious ERA-Interim feature is an overestimation of precipitation {{in the area of}} the intertropical convergence zone and the southern sub-tropics over the Atlantic Ocean. For a limited number of snow measurements by optical <b>disdrometers</b> it can be concluded that both HOAPS and ERA-Interim are suitable to detect the occurrence of solid precipitation...|$|R

To measure solid precipitation a geometrical model was developed to determine the mean crosssectional area of snow crystals for different predefined shapes and sizes. It serves to develop an algorithm, which relates the mean cross sectional area of snow crystals to their maximum dimension, liquid water content, and terminal velocity.

These freely available precipitation measurements could be of great value for improving current weather prediction, particularly in developing countries where other data is scarce. A key parameter to derive rainfall intensities is the drop size distribution (DSD). Data of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission provides amongst others the DSD and rainfall intensity, but it is unknown how well the device can convert the DSD to rain intensity. Therefore the main goal {{of this study is}} validating the GPM measurement results, by using ground based <b>disdrometers.</b> The <b>disdrometers</b> were located in De Bilt (The Netherlands), Yangon and Bago (Myanmar). In the Netherlands an industrial standard Thies LPM was used, whereas in Myanmar innovative Delft-disdrometers were tested. DSD’s obtained from the Thies LPM showed a decreasing peak for increasing rainfall intensities, which corresponds to DSD theory. In most cases the DSD’s of the Thies LPM and GPM were comparable with an average R 2 of 0. 9. On the other hand, the rainfall intensities for these two datasets were not comparable with a relative error varying between 49 and 3314 %. The very limited joint occurrence of satellite flyover and rain events caused insufficient data for validation in Myanmar.

The uncertainty in such relations highly affects the uncertainty precipitation and attenuation estimates. A commonly used method to derive such relationships is to apply regression methods to precipitation measurements and radar observables simulated from datasets of drop size distributions (DSD) using microphysical and electromagnetic assumptions.

Tipping bucket rain gauges which are {{the most commonly used}} devices simply provide the temporal evolution of cumulated rainfall depth (through the time of each tip usually corresponding to 0. 2 mm). <b>Disdrometers,</b> whose operational use is increasing, provide access to much more quantitative information such as the distribution of drops according to their size and velocity. Nevertheless the quantification of the uncertainty associated with these devices is still an open question. In this paper, the outputs of three collocated optical <b>disdrometers</b> recently installed {{on the roof of the}} Ecole des Ponts ParisTech are compared. A Campbell Scientific PWS 100 and two OTT Parsivel installed perpendicularly are deployed. An interesting point of the experimental set up is that the two devices do not rely the same process; indeed the PWS 100 computes the size and terminal fall velocity of each drop passing through the sampling area from the scattered light whereas the Parsivel ones do it from the occluded light. In a first step the raw measured size/velocity matrix (the data is binned) as well as the integrated values such as drop size distribution or its most common moments (rain rate, radar reflectivity) are analyzed for various types of events. Secondly all the moments are analyzed and not only at the maximum resolution but across scales in the framework of Universal Multifractals. They have been extensively used to characterize and simulate geophysical fields extremely variable over wide range of scales such as rainfall.

All methods improved the accuracy of rainfall estimation, except for one case where drop size distributions were not observed, as the precipitation system did not pass through the <b>disdrometer</b> location. The use of these bias correction methods reduced the RMSE {{by as much as}} 50  %. Overall, the most accurate rainfall estimates were obtained using the overlapping area method to correct radar reflectivity...|$|E
40|$|A unique microphysical {{structure}} of rainfall is observed by the surface laser optical Particle Size and Velocity (Parsivel) <b>disdrometers</b> on 25 April 2011 during Midlatitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC 3 E). According to the systematic differences in rainfall rate and bulk effective droplet radius, the sampling {{data can be}} divided into two groups; the rainfall mostly from the deep convective clouds has relatively high rainfall rate and large bulk effective droplet radius, whereas the reverse is true for the rainfall from the shallow wrm clouds. The Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with spectral bin microphysics (WRF-SBM) successfully reproduces the two distinct modes in the observed rainfall microphysical structure. The results show that the up-to-date model can demonstrate how the cloud physics and the weather condition on the day are involved in forming the unique rainfall characteristic...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAs {{part of the}} African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) field campaign, rain Drop Size Distribution (DSD) {{measurements}} were carried out in Benin, in the Sudanese climatic zone, with optical <b>disdrometers,</b> over 3 rainy seasons. The observed DSDs are well modelled by a gamma distribution, with {{the value of the}} shape parameter (μ) close to 5. The average normalized intercept parameter (N 0 *) is close to 103 mm− 1 m− 3. After classification of the convective and stratiform spectra, it is shown that for a given rain rate the proportion of the bigger drops is higher in the stratiform spectra, consistent with the observed occurrences of ‘N 0 jumps' within the squall lines. Specific reflectivity-rain rate (Z-R) relationships were derived for the whole data set, for the squall lines and for the convective and stratiform regions...|$|R
50|$|The project {{included}} DOW6, DOW7, Rapid-Scan DOW, SMART-RADARs, NOXP, UMASS-X, UMASS-W, and CIRPAS {{for their}} mobile radar contingent. The Doppler on Wheels were {{supplied by the}} Center for Severe Weather Research, and the SMART-Radars from the University of Oklahoma (OU). National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) supplied the NOXP radar, {{as well as several}} other radar units from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and Texas Tech University (TTU). NSSL and CSWR supplied mobile mesonets. Mobile radiosonde launching vehicles are provided by NSSL, NCAR, and the State University of New York at Oswego (SUNY Oswego). There were quite a few other deployable state of the art instrumentation, such as Sticknets from TTU, tornado PODS from CSWR, and four <b>disdrometers</b> from University of Colorado CU, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).|$|R
