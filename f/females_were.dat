5|$|In nature, it was {{observed}} that males would venture away from the nest in order to attract females. The males would press their gastral sterna against a perch and rub their mandibular against it. This is used to attract females, and <b>females</b> <b>were</b> observed to visit these branches and sample the scents. Interestingly, it was also found that on some occasions, males were attracted to other male scents.|$|E
50|$|According to {{government}} data, {{a total of}} 636,245 (268,080 male and 368,165 <b>female)</b> students <b>were</b> enrolled in higher education in 2006.

5|$|While poorly documented, {{chemical}} communication {{is believed to}} be important to the group. Anal secretions are produced in the hindgut, and released along the posterior setae as predator deterrents In Australia, aggregations of male common blossom thrips have been observed on the petals of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis and Gossypium hirsutum; <b>females</b> <b>were</b> attracted to these groups so {{it seems likely that the}} males were producing pheromones.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of condors grew, {{attention}} {{began to focus on}} releasing some back into the wild. In 1988, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive Andean condors into the wild in California. Only <b>females</b> <b>were</b> released, to eliminate the possibility of accidentally introducing a South American species into the United States. The experiment was a success, and all the Andean condors were recaptured and re-released in South America. California condors were released in 1991 and 1992 in California, and again in 1996 in Arizona near the Grand Canyon. Though the birth rate remains low in the wild, their numbers are increasing steadily through regular releases of captive-reared adolescents.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{discovered}} the holotype female from an M. vindex nest on 23 March 1955 northwest from Wagin at Badjanning Rocks, Western Australia. The specimen is currently {{housed in the}} Western Australian Museum in Perth. Two dealated paratype <b>females</b> <b>were</b> also collected with the holotype, looking very similar to each other except for the mandibles and colouration. The mandibular dentition varies among the three, {{and one of the}} paratypes is darker than the holotype. In 1991, a published journal reviewing the species groups assigned M. inquilina to the M. cephalotes species group. However, entomologists placed it in the M. gulosa species group one month after placing it in the M. cephalotes species group.|$|E
50|$|Normal <b>females</b> <b>are</b> always of {{genotype}} Dw/-, while dwarf <b>females</b> <b>are</b> always of genotype dw/-, because <b>female</b> <b>is</b> the heterogametic sex {{having only}} one Z chromosome.

On the other hand, normal males may be either homozygous Dw/Dw or heterozygous Dw/dw, but dwarf males are always homozygous dw/dw.|$|R
50|$|Male {{individuals}} are often {{found to be}} more active and agile whereas <b>females</b> <b>are</b> physically more powerful. One of the outcomes of these morphological variations is that only males and very young <b>females</b> <b>are</b> able to fly. Adult <b>females</b> <b>are</b> generally too large and heavy for their wings to enable a take-off.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} of the <b>female</b> <b>is</b> 26-40 mm. The <b>female</b> <b>is</b> {{similar to}} the male, but usually with much less prominently streaked forewings with red color.|$|R
5|$|During {{this time}} the Jewish Resistance Movement was formed, {{comprising}} several pre-existing Jewish groups. In 1921, the part-time Haganah was formed and trained as a national army. Most Jewish males and some <b>females</b> <b>were</b> required to join. After the Second World War, it obtained numerous surplus weapons to equip its members. The Haganah gave priority to increasing the Jewish population by bringing immigrants into the country from Europe. It always attempted to give prior notice of an attack so that any security service personnel in the area could be evacuated.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the capture of all the wild individuals of the California condor, in 1988 the US Fish and Wildlife Service began a reintroduction experiment involving the release of captive Andean condors into the wild in California.

The experiment was a success, and all the Andean condors were recaptured and re-released in South America before the reintroduction of the California condors took place.|$|E
5|$|Not all mating {{takes place}} at the lek, since only a {{minority}} of the males attend an active lek. As alternative strategies, males can also directly pursue females ("following") or wait for them as they approached good feeding sites ("intercepting"). Males switched between the three tactics, being more likely to attend a lek when the copulation rate the previous day was high or when fewer <b>females</b> <b>were</b> available after nesting had started. Lekking rates were low in cold weather early in the season when off-lek males spent most of their time feeding.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycle}} of D.sayi begins with copulation, which {{normally}} takes place shortly after the female has moulted, while her exoskeleton is still soft. Spawning occurs within hours or days of copulation, and the eggs are brooded on the female's pleopods (swimmerets) until {{they are ready to}} hatch. Females have been found carrying eggs from April to October; in a study of crabs caught at Gloucester Point, Virginia in 1978, <b>females</b> <b>were</b> observed to carry between 686 and 14,735 eggs. The number of eggs increases with carapace width according to a power law; extrapolation of the power law suggests that the largest D.sayi females are capable of carrying over 32,000 eggs each.|$|E
5|$|A typical P. exclamans worker {{will live}} somewhere between 14â€“16 days. The oldest wasp to be {{observed}} in a natural colony was 102 days old. Queens typically live 6 times longer than the workers. There has been some variation observed with the life expectancy of P. exclamans. This has typically been attributed to the colony of origin. It also {{must be noted that}} while there is variation between colonies, there typically is less variation between the original nest and the satellite nest. Variation inside a single colony may also occur {{because of the presence of}} different castes. Foragers, those who frequently travel outside the nest, lead a riskier life and tend to have lower life expectancy than those who stay in the nest. Though, it was observed that colonies with high foraging rates also had higher reproductive rates to compensate for the lower life expectancy. Another interesting aspect that was observed in one nest was that an increase in female population led to lower longevity. This was because the <b>females</b> <b>were</b> more focused on competing to become the next queen than foraging and fulfilling their roles.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the free}} {{population}} 23.4% {{of males and}} 13.4% of <b>females</b> <b>were</b> considered literate. Men represented 52% (5,123,869) of the total population.

The residents in the combined northeast and southeast regions comprised 87.2% of the nation's population. The second national census was held in 1890 when the Brazilian republic {{was only a few}} months old. Its results showed that the population had grown to 14,333,915 inhabitants since the 1872 census.|$|E
50|$|When females {{continually}} {{move and}} are not spatially stable, males pursue a mate defense strategy. When the <b>females</b> <b>are</b> clumped, four types of polygyny occur. (Adapted from Dr. Susan Alberts)When <b>females</b> <b>are</b> spatially stable in and around a resource, males pursue a resource defense strategy and polygyny occurs when the <b>females</b> <b>are</b> clumped and the offspring require little to no parental care (ex. yellow-bellied marmots, orange-rumped honeyguides).|$|R

5|$|As {{is common}} in {{frontier}} societies, the Southern Rhodesian settler community was mostly male: {{at the time of}} the First World War, white <b>females</b> <b>were</b> outnumbered by males almost two to one. Because white women were so marriageable and cheap black labour was easily available to handle domestic duties, most female settlers did not work and spent most of their days supervising the household and family. The average white woman in the colony continued to live this kind of life during the war, in marked contrast to her British counterpart, who in many cases went to replace the male factory workers and farm labourers who went to war. In Rhodesia little of this sort occurred: there were no munitions factories, and the idea of women working down the country's mines was not considered practical. Some white farmers' wives took over management of the land in their husbands' absence, but this was quite unusual.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other insects, P.exclamans use sexual pheromones to attract members of the {{opposite}} sex. Researchers have attempted to determine the exact role that sexual pheromones play in sexual attraction in paper wasps. They set up a wind tunnel where males and <b>females</b> <b>were</b> exposed to a sexual pheromone wick that was isolated from males and females. These pheromones were taken by hexane extracts from wholes bodies and thoraces of unmated females. The male extracts {{were taken from the}} ectal mandibular and seventh sternal glands. It was found that the opposite sex was attracted upwind of the scent and the results were intensified when a fan was turned on. The range of the scent was found to be around 2 metres.|$|E
5|$|Historian Ruth Brandon in {{an article}} for the New Scientist noted that William Huggins, Serjeant Cox, Crooke's wife and daughter, his {{laboratory}} assistant, and a Mrs Humphrey were all present during the Crookes experiments with Home.

5|$|In 2009, a Spanish {{research}} vessel {{conducted a study}} of the cephalopod population off the coast of Mozambique. The study found populations of V. togata across the entire study area, which ran most of the coast of Mozambique, with especially high concentrations at the very southern end of the Mozambiquan coast, in the waters near the city of Maputo. The study performed trawls in four depth groups, 200â€“400, 400â€“500, 500â€“600, and 600â€“700 meters below sea level. While V. togata was found in all four depth ranges, they were most abundant between 400 and 600 meters below sea level. The study also noted that males were most common in the shallower two groups, while <b>females</b> <b>were</b> more common in the deeper two groups.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} subject matter, {{the story of}} Joan of Arc was not well known outside of a legend. A history dealing with Joan written by Clement L'Averdy was written in 1790 but it was {{probably}} unknown to Southey. This would serve as the major historical source of information on her until Jules Quicherat's history published during the mid-19th century. Of non-historical works, Voltaire's La Pucelle was well known but the work attacks Joan. Joan's reputation was polemical, and Joan would later {{be turned into a}} French hero with Napoleon's encouragement. Friedrich Schiller would also deal with the legend the same way in Die Jungfrau von Orleans. In terms of works relying on the general idea of a warrior woman, many such figures exited in epics: Virgil and Camilla, Tasso has Clorinda, and Spenser had Britomart. However, such <b>females</b> <b>were</b> not the central figure as a woman was unique to Southey at the time.|$|E
5|$|N. lasiopterus is understudied {{due to its}} rarity; {{very little}} is known of its mating habits, {{reproductive}} pattern, life cycle and sex ratio. N. lasiopterus, as a Nyctalus species, has an outstanding capability for migration which can possibly result in considerable seasonal changes in sex ratio. The studies in North-East Hungary indicates that the sex-ratio differs greatly depending on the location. Males were exceedingly dominant in Greece and the Czech Republic while <b>females</b> <b>were</b> dominant in NE Germany, the Moscow-region, Voronezh, and NE Hungary. This sexual segregation is due to difference in sex-specific thermoregulatory and energetic requirements. The females are dominant in warmer locations because it is optimal for fetal development and milk production. On the other hand, males are dominant in cooler locations because of lower energetic demands. These results verified that N. lasiopterus have nursing colonies located in Hungary.|$|E
