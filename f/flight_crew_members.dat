50|$|Neither <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> {{conformed}} to the instructions about <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> responsibilities during a visual approach, as {{published in the}} COM. This resulted in their being unable to assure the safety of flight at low level while manoeuvring the aircraft in proximity with terrain in conditions of reduced visibility. Neither <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> {{conformed to}} the instructions about <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> coordination, as also outlined in the COM. Had they more carefully planned the second approach, and closely cooperated with each other, they may have achieved a safe approach and landing. Their disregard of the published procedures bypassed the safety criteria and inbuilt risk treatments {{in the design of}} those procedures.|$|R

25|$|On STS-61-C, Bolden piloted Space Shuttle Columbia. During {{the six-day}} <b>flight,</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> {{deployed}} the SATCOM Ku band satellite, and conducted experiments in astrophysics and materials processing. The mission launched from Kennedy Space Center on January 12, 1986, orbited the Earth 96 times, {{and ended with}} a successful night landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California on January 18, 1986.|$|E
25|$|The {{hull of the}} Type H was, {{like that}} of its predecessors, a single step design. A pair of flat {{bottomed}} floats, mounted below the outer interplane struts, stabilized the aircraft on the water. Two <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> were accommodated side-by-side and a front gunner sat separately in the nose. The rounded, finless rudder mounted above the high tailplane distinguished the Type H from earlier FBA flying boats, which had angular vertical tails.|$|E

25|$|Cockpit {{procedures}} were also changed. Hierarchical relations among crew members were played down. More emphasis {{was placed on}} team decision-making by mutual agreement. Less experienced <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> were encouraged to challenge their captains when they believed something was not correct, and captains were instructed to listen to their crew and evaluate all decisions in light of crew concerns. This concept was later expanded into what is known today as crew resource management (CRM), training in which is now mandatory for all airline pilots.|$|E
25|$|One issue {{treated as}} {{secondary}} at the inquiry was the {{presence in the}} flight deck observer's seat of Captain Collins. The Lane report recommended greater caution in allowing off-duty <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> to occupy flight deck seats, and aired speculation that Collins might have been distracting his colleagues. The report noted that Collins' body {{was found to be}} holding a can of aerosol air freshener in its right hand. Sources close to the events of the time suggest that Collins played an altogether more positive role by attempting to lower the leading-edge devices in the final seconds of the flight; Eric Pritchard, a Trident captain who happened to be the first airman at the accident site, recalled that a fireman had stated that Collins was lying across the centre pedestal and noted himself that his earphones had fallen into the right-hand-side footwell of the flight deck, diagonally across from the observer's seat, as might be expected if he had attempted to intervene as a last resort.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a direct}} result of the accident, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration created a Takeoff and Landing Performance Assessment Aviation Rule-making Committee. (i.e. TALPA ARC). In 2016, based on the {{recommendations}} of TALPA ARC, the FAA implemented new [...] "Runway Condition Code" [...] method for the communication of runway conditions from airport management to <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members.</b>|$|E
2500|$|US {{regulations}} require {{at least}} two <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> {{to be in the}} cockpit at all times for safety reasons, {{to be able to help}} in any [...] medical or other emergency, including intervening if a crew member would try to crash the plane. Following the deliberate crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 on March 24, 2015, some European and Canadian airlines adopted a two-in-cockpit policy as did all Australian airlines for aircraft with fifty or more passenger seats.|$|E

2500|$|The Antonov An-12 {{belonging}} to the Soviet Air Force that {{was involved in the}} accident (callsign 08525) was part of a formation of four aircraft demonstrating tactical flight maneuvers to the Minister of Defense, Andrei Grechko. [...] Two of the aircraft were transporting equipment; the other two, including the one involved in the crash, was carrying paratroopers of the 7th Guards Mountain Air Assault Division. Five <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> and 91 paratroopers were aboard the aircraft, all of whom perished in the crash. [...] The cockpit crew consisted of the following pilots: Major Alexei Ryabtsev, Junior lieutenant Vladimir Priplov, and Captain Nikolai Mikhailovich Maslyuk.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 May 1977, New York Airways' {{commercial}} S-61-L, N619PA, {{suffered a}} static rollover onto its starboard {{side at the}} heliport {{on top of the}} Pan Am Building while boarding passengers. The accident killed four boarding passengers and one woman on the street. 17 additional passengers and the three <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> <b>members</b> were uninjured. The landing gear collapse was a result of metal fatigue in the helicopter's main landing gear shock-absorbing strut assembly, which caused the helicopter to tip over without warning. The accident resulted in the permanent closure of the Pan Am Building heliport. [...] As the heliport was closed, the wreckage was removed by disassembling it and taking the assemblies down to street level using the building's freight elevators. The airframe was taken to Cape Town, South Africa, where it was rebuilt, certified and returned to service as the first S61 used in the Ship-Service Role off the shores of the Western Cape by the company [...] "Court Helicopter" [...] which was later amalgamated with CHC.|$|E

500|$|The cockpit was {{severely}} damaged in the impact. It struck {{an oak tree}} which penetrated the area occupied by Klotz and Moyano. All the seats occupied by the <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> were found outside the cockpit. Neither of the pilots' seats had shoulder straps as were required by United States domestic passenger flights. At least one <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> <b>member</b> was airlifted to Nassau County Medical Center. The NTSB report states {{that all of the}} <b>flight</b> <b>crew</b> [...] "died from blunt force head and upper torso trauma." [...] Five flight attendants also died from blunt force trauma to the limbs, abdomen, chest, and head.|$|R
