5|$|Phase 2: Khalid divided his mobile guard {{into two}} {{divisions}} and attacked the flanks of the Byzantine left center, while the infantry of the Muslim right center attacked from front. Under this three-pronged flanking manoeuvre, the Byzantines <b>fell</b> <b>back.</b> Meanwhile, the Muslim right wing renewed its offense with its infantry attacking {{from the front}} and the cavalry reserve attacking the northern flank of the Byzantine left wing. As the Byzantine left center retreated under three-pronged attacks of Khalid, the Byzantine left wing, having been exposed at its southern flank, also <b>fell</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
5|$|Qanatir led two {{armies of}} Slavs against the Muslim right wing and right centre with some {{assistance}} from the Armenians and Christian Arabs led by Jabalah. The Muslim right wing and right center again <b>fell</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{defeated}} consular armies <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> to Rome {{to regroup}} while Spartacus' followers moved northward. The consuls again engaged Spartacus {{somewhere in the}} Picenum region, and once again were defeated.|$|E

5|$|After {{holding off}} the initial attacks by the Byzantines, the Muslim right wing <b>fell</b> <b>back,</b> {{followed}} by the right center. They were again {{said to have been}} met by their own womenfolk who abused and shamed them. The corps, however, managed to reorganize some distance from the camp and held their ground preparing for a counterattack.|$|E
5|$|At {{the edge}} of town, the 55th Regiment {{received}} orders from Mawhood to fall back and join the 40th Regiment in town. The 40th had taken up a position just outside town, {{on the north side}} of a ravine. The 55th formed up to the left of the 40th. The 55th sent a platoon to flank the oncoming Americans, but it was cut to pieces. When Sullivan sent several regiments to scale the ravine, they <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> to a breastwork. After making a brief stand, the British <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> again, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Alexander Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them blast away at the building. Then some Americans rushed the front door, broke it down, and the British put a white flag outside one of the windows. Exactly 194 British soldiers walked out of the building and laid down their arms.|$|E
5|$|Crucially, the Prussians did not {{retreat to}} the east, along their own lines of communication. Instead, they, too, <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> northwards—parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within {{supporting}} distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on Bülow's IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of Wavre.|$|E

5|$|Golubac {{was held}} by the Habsburg Monarchy between 1688 and 1690 and 1718 and 1739. Serb rebels {{controlled}} it during Kočina Krajina in 1788–91, and again from 1804–13, during the First Serbian Uprising. Afterwards, it <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> under Ottoman control until 1867 when it, along with Kalemegdan and other towns in Serbia, was given to Knez Mihailo of Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton won the race, having {{overtaken}} Rosberg at the start, who <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> to fourth, but recovered {{to finish}} second. Rosberg's {{deficit in the}} Drivers' Championship therefore increased to 48 points. Sebastian Vettel finished third for Ferrari. This was the first race in which all cars were classified as finishers since the 2011 European Grand Prix, {{and would not be}} replicated again until the 2016 Chinese Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|On February 15, NASA {{scientists}} {{identified the}} crater formed by Deep Impact in images from Stardust.

50|$|In August 2011, {{the mall}} {{embarked}} {{on its first}} attempt at en bloc sales, slated {{to be completed in}} mid-2012. But the $445 million deal <b>fell</b> through. <b>Back</b> then, the apportioned value to each owner was an average of $2,000 to $2,800 per square foot.|$|R
5|$|The Austrians <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> into Alessandria, {{having lost}} {{about half the}} forces they had committed. The Austrians had lost heavily in the 12 hours of fighting: 15 colours, 40 guns, almost 8,000 taken prisoner, and 6,500 dead or wounded. French {{casualties}} (killed and wounded) were {{on the order of}} 4,700 and 900 missing or captured, but they retained the battlefield and the strategic initiative. Desaix's body was found among the slain.|$|E
5|$|The {{survivors}} of Marsyas <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> to a sacred grove of Zeus at Labraunda and deliberated whether {{to surrender to}} the Persians or to flee Asia altogether. However, while deliberating, {{they were joined by}} a Milesian army, and with these reinforcements resolved instead to carry on fighting. The Persians then attacked the army at Labraunda, and inflicted an even heavier defeat, with the Milesians suffering particularly bad casualties.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the race, Rosberg's lead in the Drivers' Championship over Hamilton was reduced to a single point (168 to 167 points), with Räikkönen {{following}} in third with 106 points. Sebastian Vettel <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> to fifth with 98 points, two points behind Daniel Ricciardo. In the Constructors' standings, Mercedes extended its lead over Ferrari to 131 points, while Red Bull closed in on Ferrari and was only six points behind.|$|E

60|$|A {{few minutes}} later the bamboos forming {{the wall of the}} six houses where a bustle had been {{observed}} fell outward, the lashings having been cut by a swarm of Malays, who, as soon as the last <b>fell,</b> ran <b>back,</b> showing eight brass cannon.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of this {{influence}} plus their academic training from Rimsky-Korsakov, especially in the cases of Anton Arensky and Glazunov, these composers combined the best compositional techniques of The Five and Tchaikovsky in their music. Often, however, composers in this group <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> on two sources—musical clichés and mannerisms handed down from The Five, and academic compositional techniques learned at the Conservatory. Also, the eclecticism about which Rimsky-Korsakov wrote tended to overpower originality in many works, including those of Glazunov. Nevertheless, the Belyayev circle continued to influence the development of Russian music well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|As {{previously}} planned, {{most of the}} Texians <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> to {{the barracks}} and the chapel. Holes had been carved in the walls to allow the Texians to fire. Unable to reach the barracks, Texians stationed along the west wall headed west for the San Antonio River. When the cavalry charged, the Texians took cover and began firing from a ditch. Sesma was forced to send reinforcements, and the Texians were eventually killed. Sesma reported that this skirmish involved 50Texians, but Edmondson believes that number was inflated.|$|E
5|$|As {{the militia}} <b>fell</b> <b>back,</b> {{the three men}} who had set out in search of their horses {{returned}} and they too {{were killed by the}} Native American forces. The natives continued to assault the barn and cabin; their attacks did not cease and during the battle about 25 horses were killed. Finally, the native forces withdrew, leaving nine of their own dead behind. The June 25 battle was the last of the Black Hawk War on Illinois soil. Dement's company lost five men with another three were wounded, many horses were killed as well.|$|E
60|$|The {{chairman}} {{took a sip}} of water, and resumed. Almost all in {{the last}} six rows were now on their feet, and amid a hubbub of murmurs the chairman held out to the secretary the slips of his speech, and <b>fell</b> heavily <b>back</b> into his chair.|$|R
60|$|A brief silence {{followed}} the assassin's cowardly act. White with terror, now, Bu-lot <b>fell</b> slowly <b>back</b> toward the doorway at his rear, when suddenly angry warriors leaped with drawn knives to prevent his escape and to avenge their king. But Mo-sar now took his stand beside his son.|$|R

5|$|Boston College {{began its}} second {{possession}} of the fourth quarter knowing it had to score a touchdown to tie the game. Quarterback Matt Ryan had his best success of the day, connecting on sevenof tenpasses during the drive and picking up 58yards. All of the Eagles' yardage on the drive came through the air, and with 2:25 remaining, the Eagles found themselves at the Virginia Tech 14-yard line. Facing a fourth down and needing fouryards for a first down, Matt Ryan <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> to attempt a pass. The throw was intercepted by Virginia Tech's Vince Hall.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{it became}} obvious, even to Ney, that cavalry alone were {{achieving}} little. Belatedly, he organised a combined-arms attack, using Bachelu's division and Tissot's regiment of Foy's division from Reille's II Corps (about 6,500infantrymen) plus those French cavalry that remained {{in a fit}} state to fight. This assault was directed along much the same route as the previous heavy cavalry attacks (between Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte). It was halted by a charge of the Household Brigade cavalry led by Uxbridge. The British cavalry were unable, however, to break the French infantry, and <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> with losses from musketry fire.|$|E
5|$|Fleury <b>fell</b> <b>back</b> to 33goals in 1991–92 as the Flames {{missed the}} playoffs. That season, {{he made his}} second All-Star Game appearance, {{recording}} a goal for the Campbell Conference. Fleury finished with over 100points {{for the second time}} in his career in 1992–93 to lead the team in scoring, and set a franchise record by going +9 in a 13–1 victory over the San Jose Sharks on February 10, 1993, in which he scored six points.|$|E
