25|$|Cavite, {{which had}} been home {{to most of the}} Spanish fleet in the Philippines, {{suffered}} from unhealthy living conditions and was vulnerable in time of war and bad weather because of its shallow water and lack of shelter. Because of these, a military expedition was sent to Subic Bay in 1868 with orders to survey the bay to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> would be a suitable site for a naval yard. The Spanish explored the entire bay and concluded that it had much promise and thus reported their findings to Cavite. This report was not well-accepted in Manila as the Spanish command was reluctant to move to the provincial isolation of Subic. Finally, in 1884, a Royal Decree declared Subic Bay as a naval port.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{reported}} crimes in which the perpetrators cited Grand Theft Auto IV as their primary influence. On 27 June 2008, six teenagers were arrested after participating in a crime spree in New Hyde Park, New York. The teenagers mugged a man, knocking his teeth out, attempted to hijack a car, and smashed a passing van with a bat. According to the Nassau County Police, the teenagers claimed that they were inspired by Grand Theft Auto IV. On 4 August 2008, BBC Newsbeat reported that an 18-year-old student had been arrested in Bangkok, Thailand for the murder of a taxi driver after attempting to hijack the vehicle. Bangkok police captain Veerarit Pipatanasak stated that the student [...] "wanted to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game". Grand Theft Auto IV was subsequently banned in Thailand as a result. On 24 August 2013, Sky News reported that a 90-year-old woman was killed in Slaughter, Louisiana when an eight-year-old boy grabbed a handgun and shot her in the head after playing Grand Theft Auto IV.|$|E

40|$|Alfonso Vagnone S. J. (1566 – 1640) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prolific}} humanistic writers in Chinese of late Ming China. His pedagogic treatise 《Tongyou Jiaoyu 童幼教育 (On the Education of Children) 》 (published around 1632) is the result of over a decade of work, and deals with various matters of child education from two perspectives (teaching and learning). The book is thought to be “the oldest proof of Sino-Western exchange in the field of pedagogy” and is aimed at introducing notions of Western learning and philosophy to the Chinese readers. This paper intends to shed light on the way Vagnone introduced the concept of friendship in the ninth chapter of the second volume,《Jiaoyou 交友 (Friendship)  》of his treatise 《Tongyou Jiaoyu 童幼教育》.

The garden of the house is full of strange thorny bushes and vines, which neither of the merchant nor his three daughters can identify. Beauty asks in the town and discovers that they are the roses the cottage are called after and begins to tend them, because she loves gardening and she remembers the smell of her mother's rose perfume. Roses are very rare because only great magic or great love can grow them. The roses bloom under Beauty's care, and the sisters sells wreaths of them in the town. After some time, the merchant hears word that one of his ships might have made it back and journeys to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>it's</b> true.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>it's</b> {{feasible}} to use on/off solenoid valves and pneumatic actuators to operate heavy duty manual transmissions. The shift and select operations in the transmission will be position controlled to reduce wear and tear. The on/off solenoid valves are more complicated to control than proportional valves, but are cheaper, smaller and more robust. Production cost is a crucial factor {{in all parts of}} automotive industry. This lead to limiting sensory inputs to only a position sensor for each of the two actuators. The gear change dynamics of a heavy duty transmission with the added pneumatics was modeled in MATLAB-Simulink. This enabled the development of a gain scheduled controller for the system. The pneumatics and control system was then implemented in a test rig consisting of a transmission driven by an electric motor, and the results were compared to those of the simulations. The results show that full gear changes with both shift and select actuation can be done in under 350 ms, and that the model replicates the dynamics in a realistic manner. It was found that one should implement RPM-matching in the system. This would lead to less wear and tear on the transmission, lower shift times and higher consistency in shift times. These results show that the use of on/off solenoid valves are a feasible choice of control method for the system. </p...|$|R

40|$|With the {{continuously}} increasing {{amount of}} online information, {{there is a}} pressing need to structure this information. Text classification (TC) is a technique which classifies textual information into a predefined set of categories. This thesis describes a case study on classifying news articles on two different datasets collected by the business-to-business news publisher ASDMedia. The goal is to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>it's</b> possible to use a machine learning (ML) approach to TC to construct a classification system {{that can be used}} in a semi-automatic setting. Two main challenges of the cases are that news articles are potentially labeled with multiple categories (multi-label) and the dataset is very imbalanced. For analytical purposes, we restrict ourselves to ML algorithms that generate humanly interpretable models, namely decision trees. We applied state-of-the-art techniques to solve the above mentioned challenges and conduct various experiments. Our focus is on 1) Finding the best feature representation of news articles and 2) Trying out techniques to exploit structures within the class labels; namely classifier chains (CC) and hierarchical top-down classification (HTC). By using the optimized feature representation and by applying the CC technique we managed to improve the results substantially for both datasets from a default setup. The best settings reached a Micro-F 1 value of. 625 and. 752 for both ASDMedia datasets. We can conclude that our constructed classification system is suited to be part of a semi-automated system. However, advisable is to collect more data for the minority categories. Although HTC looked promising and saves a lot of CPU-time, the actual performance was considerably lower than not using it...|$|R

Curs: 2014 / 2015 Throughout {{this essay}} I intend {{to analyze the}} current {{knowledge}} that the positive psychology has provided to the organizations field. In the last years, the concern about the employees’ well-being has increased. The concern to reduce the degree of the psychosocial risks that can provoke a reduction of the performance in the employees and work satisfaction has also increased. For this reason, more and more companies act of a quickly and proactively to avoid this kind of problems or to reduce the possibilities that the employees can feel stressed, less involved, engaged, creative, innovative or they don’t want responsibilities. We can {{find a lot of}} companies that become healthy organizations where there’s a concern about their employees’ and the company’s ‘health’ to avoid to this kind of risks can happen. So, one of the main goals of this work, will be investigate if the HERO Model 1 can be a solution to fight against the presence of the psychosocial risks in the organizations.

We have chosen to examine two fields of work in the same organization to be able to see possible similarities and dissimilarities that occur in the same organization. In our studies at B –level we examined the use of critical reflection, using social workers that just gotten their degree and that were out working on their first job. In our study we discovered that because of the culture in the organization it’s easier to accommodate the already existing ways of working, than to “go your own way”. This conclusion led us toward to examine more professional experienced social workers to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>it’s</b> easier to be more flexible to the culture of the organization if you’re more experienced and dare to question the organizations way of action. Our research method is based on qualitative interviews using six experienced social workers from two different fields of social work. The result from our interviews are analysed and related to relevant theories. The final conclusion of our study is that the two examined fields of social work, knows the importance of reflecting over their way of work. Unfortunately the social workers often have too much work, and little time, to reflect over both things that gone well and things that gone not so well in their contacts with clients. We found that it’s easier to find time to be reflecting if problems occur...|$|R
