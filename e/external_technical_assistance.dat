40|$|Summary. — To {{what extent}} can <b>external</b> <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> develop the {{capacity}} of counterparts, whether in government or in local nongovernmental organizations (LNGOs) in an aid-dependent economy? Cambodia’s experience since 1993 suggests that most projects {{in such a situation}} are donor-driven in their identification, design and implementation, to the detriment of capacity development. Connected with this is the chronic underfunding of government in such an economy, which hinders implementation of projects and threatens post-project financial sustainability. Unless donors develop a coherent strategy (rather than competitive, project-related salary supplementa-tion) to deal with this situation, the record of technical assistance in developing capacity will continue to be disappointing, and an escape from aid dependence will be postponed. 200...|$|E

This reform process is actively supported by senior management and {{is led by the}} SADC Executive Secretary. A key driver for the reform has been the new Secretariat Institutional Reforms Co-Coordinating Committee (SIRCC, established in 2010), an innovation of the Executive Secretary, to progress and co-ordinate the reforms by engaging all key stakeholders in the process, maximising synergy and impact. To support the SIRCC, and to maximise engagement and interaction between the Secretariat’s technical staff and <b>external</b> <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> funded by the EU and Germany through GIZ, a number of Technical Working Groups (TWGs) were established. The TWGs have proved highly effective in integrating technical advice and guidance, at the same time building increased and sustainable capacity and skills within the Secretariat. Nuts and bolts An institutional assessment was undertaken in 2010 which defined the ‘roadmap ’ to be followed for SADC to secure compliance with the international benchmarks in accounting, audit, internal controls, and procurement. The extent of the work which needed to be undertaken by the Secretariat to meet these requirements required an intensive, all out, approach, supported by <b>external</b> <b>technical</b> <b>assistance,</b> to build in-house capacity and to achieve early institutional compliance. As a new oversight committee, the SIRCC was identified as the best means to monitor the achievement of reform and compliance.

While it is well-recognized that the growth of small firms is vital to economic growth in the United States and that some form of <b>external</b> <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> is needed to sustain this growth, only minor attention to models or theories of technical assistance have been investigated and validated. Small firms face many barriers to competitiveness that include a wide range of needs from lack of information, to inability to implement new technology, to scarcity of resources. Among these numerous challenges, the one offering the greatest opportunity for leverage and growth is the deployment of new technology, where new technology is broadly defined to not only include machines and software, but enlightened methods for management of the enterprise. The results of the review indicate that while technical assistance efforts remain uncoordinated generally, considerable evidence suggests that regional infrastructures are supporting the increase of such outreach efforts. An examination of the approaches used in technical assistance indicates a number of salient features of performance technology, especially a systems approach to implementing new technology.

Implementation of these projects led to the conclusion that an integrated river improvement master plan was needed to mitigate the flooding problem. As a result, the present project was set up to prepare such a plan for the Rewa river, a plan that could serve as an example for the other major rivers in Fiji. Using field surveys and data capture, combined with rainfall time series, a number of possible flood mitigation scenarios were examined by means of a mathematical computer simulation model. Application of cost-benefit analyses, combined with socio- economic parameters, let to the selection of a short-list of efficient flood-mitigation measures.

The observed trade collapse in 1991 was exacerbated by deep domestic recession and political unrest in the region. To alleviate the costs of transition and to preserve existing trade links in Eastern Europe, the idea of a Central European Payments Union has been put forward, modelled on the successful archetype of the European Payments Union. But the present situation in Eastern Europe is different in many important respects from that of Western Europe in the late 1940 s. Moreover, the observed trade decline is to a large extent a `natural' outcome of the elimination of the preferential and highly distortionary trading system of the CMEA.

RESULTS: Before 1999,anon-governmental TB control programme was established in several districts in parallel with the government TB programme, and showed optimistic results. <b>External</b> donor funds, <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> and local control strategies were key components. In 1999, conflict led to complete disruption of both programmes. In 2000, a National Tuberculosis Control Programme (NTP) was established from the non-governmental programme in collaboration with other partners. The smear-positive TB case notification rate of 108 per 100000 population is the highest in the region and reflects high population coverage. The cure rate of 81 % is close to reaching the WHO target. CONCLUSION: High-quality TB control has been introduced in conflict-affected East Timor. Further research is needed to examine Timorese approaches to inform other, similar settings...|$|R

Import growth has been robust {{on account of the}} economic recovery but the impact on the current account has been partially offset by increased tourism receipts. The efforts to reform the tax system and strengthen social security are necessary to place Dominica’s public finances over the long term on a firmer footing.

40|$|This 2003 Article IV Consultation {{highlights}} {{that economic}} performance of The Gambia deteriorated substantially in 2002 – 03. A {{collapse of the}} groundnut harvest in 2002 led to a contraction of real GDP by 3 percent while also affecting export revenues in 2003. At the same time, poor execution of monetary and fiscal policy, reflecting serious deficiencies in governance, caused the exchange rate to depreciate and inflation to surge. In 2003, the fiscal deficit is estimated to have declined to 6. 0 percent of GDP, compared with a budget target of 4. 5 percent.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{undertake}} a programme for designing, developing and evaluating improved agricultural equipment at the national level, the Government decided to concentrate all related activities at a single location. The purpose of this project was therefore {{to assist in the}} establishment of the Agricultural Implements Research and Improvement Centre (AIRIC) at Nazareth. As a result of the project's activities, the workshop facilities of the AIRIC, and the capabilities of the national staff are now adequate to support programmes for designing, developing and testing hand tools and implements, as well as relatively simple power equipmentThe improved agricultural tools, implements and machines developed in the AIRIC had yet to reach extension workers, manufacturers and farmers because of the absence of institutional linkages between the AIRIC and extension and manufacturing organizations, and the lack of well-defined procedures for the transfer of technology developed in the AIRIC to user organizations. Agreement had been reached in principle for a second phase of assistance, and it was recommended that, during that period, priority be given to the establishment of an institutional network {{in the form of a}} coordinating committee. The committee should be responsible for coordinating all activities relating to the design, development, evaluation, prototype production, extension and manufacture of improved agricultural equipment in Ethiopia. In this context, it was recommended that on-farm evaluation of prototypes be carried out in pilot areas, each representative of a major agroclimatic zone of the countryIn the absence of a national strategy for agricultural mechanization, the AIRIC programme to date has been based on a short-term rather than a long-term perspective. It was recommended that such a long-term strategy be prepared, consistent with the national agricultural policy, and that the Government consider seeking <b>external</b> <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> for this purpose. The AIRIC's medium-term and long-term research and development programme should then be formulated within the framework of the strateg...|$|E
40|$|Many public {{programs}} and operations by multilateral organisations include <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> to the direct {{beneficiaries of the}} program in addition to pure financing. However, there is no substantial body of studies that calculates the additional impact; in the sense of exclusively attributable to, of <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> on the outcome of interest of the program. We propose the use of multi-treatment impact evaluation method -propensity score combined with exact matching for dosage and double difference- for estimating <b>technical</b> <b>assistance’s</b> impact.
