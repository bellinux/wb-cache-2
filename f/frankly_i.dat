5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite <b>frankly</b> <b>I</b> would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E

And, <b>frankly,</b> <b>I</b> went {{through a couple of}} experiences that left me pretty disgusted with it all, and I was thinking the time had passed. I was just sitting at home reading magazines and looking out the window — a couple of projects I had had just fallen apart — when I got a call from Sly, who had sent me a script.|$|E
500|$|Rangel {{is known}} for his blunt {{speaking}} and candor, which are rarely meant to be taken personally. [...] This tendency has grown as he has gotten older and less bothered by what others think of him. [...] When asked how he would like to be remembered, he said, [...] "Well, as Rhett Butler once said in Gone With the Wind, if I'm gone, quite <b>frankly,</b> <b>I</b> don't give a damn." [...] In any case, he has fairly often made controversial remarks.|$|E

500|$|Following her marriage, Kajol {{moved in}} with Devgan and his parents at the latter's ancestral house in Juhu. While media members speculated about a lack of {{compatibility}} between her in-laws and her, Kajol clarified that they were [...] "like parents to me" [...] and encouraged her to continue working in films. Tabloids have often romantically linked Devgan with other Bollywood actresses, and have reported about an imminent divorce. Refuting the rumours, Kajol stated, [...] "I don't believe in those rumours because I know the way this industry functions. [...] You cannot continue a marriage without the basic trust. <b>Frankly,</b> <b>I</b> don't care for such talk." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} criticised {{for the use}} of some [...] "sexist dialogues" [...] in the first half which were playing to a certain [...] "new generation" [...] audience. Sowmya Rajendran of Sify criticised the same and stated about one of such scenes in the film, [...] "it is such banter, which we often dismiss with a laugh, that helps {{perpetuate}} rape culture." [...] When asked about this, the director replied, [...] "I firmly believe such conversations are part of our lives. I don't want to elaborate, but it also throws an insight into each character featured in the sequences. Yes, <b>frankly,</b> <b>I</b> was a bit worried how the family audience would react to those scenes. But then I read out that part of the script to a select group of women and they nodded their heads in approval." ...|$|E
500|$|Keith DeCandido for Tor.com {{said that}} second season {{was the one}} on which {{the rest of the}} series was based, with {{characters}} taking long-term roles such as Geordi La Forge as Chief Engineer and Worf at the Tactical station. DeCandido said that the addition of Goldberg as Guinan was [...] "delightful", but that Diana Muldaur as Dr. Pulaski [...] "didn't entirely work as a character". In his view, the episodes during season two were varied in quality. He gave [...] "Q Who" [...] ten out of ten, while he gave [...] "Shades of Grey" [...] a zero. It {{was the first time he}} awarded the top score to an episode; none of the first season had qualified. He gave the season an overall mark of seven out of ten and said that [...] "Far too many people say that TNG didn't come into its own until the third season, and <b>frankly,</b> <b>I</b> think that that estimation comes a year too late." ...|$|E

500|$|Fearnet critic Alyse Wax wrote [...] "This episode made {{my brain}} hurt. [...] And I {{mean that in}} the nicest way possible. They were {{throwing}} a lot of weird shit at us. It was great because I feel like we are finally getting answers, like we will finally get some closure, and just maybe {{get rid of the}} Red universe stiffs. This episode was so ridiculously dense I am sure I missed some of the deeper scientific facts. I got the gist of it, though, and <b>frankly,</b> <b>I</b> much prefer these jam-packed episodes. I like when the puzzle pieces start falling into place. It's calming." [...] SFScope's Sarah Stegall believed the episode [...] "start out interestingly enough", but unlike other reviewers, she was very critical of the First People mythology, stating [...] "This is where my disbelief not only stopped being suspended, it got up {{and walked out of the}} room... I still don't like the premise of the evolution of an entire hominid species that left not one single solitary fossil behind. It's more like fantasy than science fiction." [...] Stegall praised Torv's acting as she plays [...] "two people very subtly, very convincingly", and concluded her review by commenting she will continue to watch the series because she trusts the writers will [...] "supply us with plausible answers from time to time", but is [...] "losing some respect for it".|$|E
500|$|Sportswriters {{and fans}} have {{frequently}} called for Henderson to be {{inducted into the}} Hockey Hall of Fame on the strength of his performance. [...] Commentator and former NHL coach Don Cherry argued that Henderson's status as hero of the [...] "greatest series in hockey history" [...] was enough to qualify him. [...] Henderson himself does not believe he belongs: [...] "So many Canadians get upset that I’m not in the Hall of Fame, and I tell them all the time if I was on the committee, I wouldn’t vote for me. Quite <b>frankly,</b> <b>I</b> didn’t have a Hall of Fame career." [...] Henderson has been honoured by Canada's Sports Hall of Fame on two occasions: he was first inducted as an individual in 1995, and again ten years later along with his 1972 teammates. The Summit Series team has also been honoured with a star on Canada's Walk of Fame. Henderson has been inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame (1997), the IIHF Hall of Fame (2013) and has been honoured by Hockey Canada with the Order of Hockey in Canada as part of its 2013 class. He was named a Member of the Order of Canada in December 2012 in recognition of [...] "his engagement in support of a range of social and charitable causes" [...] along with his achievements on the ice. In 2014, he was named to the Order of Ontario.|$|E

2500|$|Baldwin's {{vice presidential}} run, and Peroutka's {{withdrawal}} from the national Constitution Party, led to active 2006 speculation that Baldwin would seek the presidential nomination in 2008. Baldwin responded in October that [...] "I have learned to never say never, but I {{have no desire to}} run. [...] would require several 'miraculous' signs of reassurance that, <b>frankly,</b> <b>I</b> cannot see happening. However, I am always open to God's will."

I wish people wouldn't be very big for five minutes and rotten for twenty years. Just keep your 'big' and keep your 'rotten' and get out of my life, because, quite <b>frankly,</b> <b>I</b> would rather have gone to a children's home and be with a lot of other kids being treated the same.

So, {{a lot depends on}} Japan, <b>frankly...</b> <b>I</b> think if it does well enough here we'll be in good shape for that." [...] Although producer Deborah Forte had, in March 2008, expressed optimism that the sequels would be made, by October 2008, the two planned sequels were officially placed on hold, according to New Line Cinema, because of financial concerns during the global recession. Sam Elliott, however, stated, [...] "The Catholic Church ... lambasted them, and I think it scared New Line off." ...|$|E

2500|$|Graffiti is {{the most}} {{controversial}} of hip hop's elements, {{as a number of}} the most notable graffiti pioneers say that they do not consider graffiti to be an element of hip hop, including Lady Pink, Seen, Blade, Fargo, Cholly Rock, Fuzz One, and Coco 144. Lady Pink says, [...] "I don’t think graffiti is hip hop. <b>Frankly</b> <b>I</b> grew up with disco music. There's a long background of graffiti as an entity unto itself," [...] and Fargo says, [...] "There is no correlation between hip hop and graffiti, one {{has nothing to do with}} the other."

2500|$|But after 1986, {{whenever}} the controversy involving Grammy Award for Best New Artist arose, Houston's ineligibility for that category was often mentioned. Those were the cases {{with the past}} winners such as 1988's Jody Watley and 1999's Lauryn Hill, established their [...] "public identities" [...] through their work with Shalamar and the Fugees respectively. When Shelby Lynne received the trophy in 2001, {{more than a decade}} after charting several singles on the country charts, so did it. Richard Marx, ruled ineligible for nomination as Best New Artist in 1988, stuck it to the NARAS about their inconsistency, on the feature article about him of Orange Coast magazine, stating as follows: [...] " [...] But so did Whitney Houston for the same reason. And <b>frankly,</b> <b>I</b> don't {{have a lot of respect}} for N.A.R.A.S., the Grammy people's ruling system, because it's so inconsistent. They deemed me and Whitney Houston ineligible, and yet they nominated Jody Watley, who made records with Shalamar." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lütjens was, however, {{encouraged}} by his commander-in-chief to proceed and he eventually decided that an operation should begin {{as soon as}} possible to prevent the enemy's gaining any respite. He accepted that the current situation meant that German capital ships must be present in the Atlantic. Though Raeder insisted on the operation, he advised Lütjens to act thoughtfully and carefully without taking too high a risk. Raeder did, however, admonish his subordinate to one end: if he were brought to battle despite his best efforts, it should be conducted with full force, to the end. He gave Lütjens full freedom of action, since only he {{was in a position to}} judge the immediate situation while at sea. Raeder later wrote, [...] "It does Lütjens great credit that he did not hesitate to express this view to me so <b>frankly.</b> <b>I</b> then sought to convince him of the cogency of my arguments....Although Lütjens was perhaps not entirely convinced by my views, our discussion ended in complete understanding." ...|$|E
