2500|$|In {{his closing}} remarks, Reagan asked viewers: [...] "Are you better off now {{than you were}} four years ago? Is it easier {{for you to go}} and buy things in the stores than it was four years ago? Is there more or less {{unemployment}} in the country than there was four years ago? Is America as respected throughout the world as it was? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> our security is as safe, that we're as strong as we were four years ago? And if you answer all of those questions 'yes', why then, I think your choice is very obvious as to whom you will vote for. If you don't agree, if you don't think that this course that we've been on {{for the last four years}} is what you would like to see us follow for the next four, then I could suggest another choice that you have." ...|$|E

There appears such a concurrence in the views, such a deference to the suggestions and wishes, and such an acquiescence in the prejudices of Grattan and the Ponsonbys that there seems to me no other way of rescuing you and English government from the annihilation which is impending over it. ...the inordinate desire of George Ponsonby [...] <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the government of Ireland is really in your hands? ...

6000|$|Now, my friends, to {{make the}} matter simpler, I will take you at your words, {{for the sake of}} argument. Suppose you do avoid sin from the fear of hell, does that make what you do RIGHT? Does that make YOU right? Does that make your heart right? It is a great blessing to a man's neighbours, certainly, if he is kept from doing wrong any how-- by the fear of hell, or fear of jail, or fear of shame, or fear of ghosts if you like, or any other cowardly and foolish motive--a great blessing to a man's neighbours: but no blessing, that I can see, to the man himself. He is just the same; his heart is not changed; his heart is no more right in the sight of God, or in the sight of any man of common sense either, than it would be if he did the wrong thing, which he loves and dare not <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> yourselves about other people.

30|$|Thirdly, {{we control}} for the worker ability by relying on the two proxy {{variables}} reported by the ESS interviewer when answering the questions, “Overall, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the respondent understood the questions?” (ESS 2008 c, p. 75) and “Did the respondent ask for clarification on any questions?” (ESS 2008 c, p. 74). The answers were originally coded into five categories: never, almost never, now and then, often, or very often. We recoded each of these variables into a dummy variable: ability 1 equals one if the respondent understood the questions very often or often and zero otherwise; ability 2 equals one if the respondent never or almost never required clarifications on the questions and zero otherwise.|$|R
