50|$|The main {{fields of}} {{application}} include the automation of breweries (see brewery) and/or fermenting and storage cellars. Also a complete automation {{of all the}} production areas of a brewery (e.g. at Warsteiner Beer and Brewery) - from raw material <b>intake</b> <b>to</b> <b>filling</b> - can be realised with the brewmaxx process control systems. The “small” control system, brewmaxx compact, has been available for individual production areas, e.g. ancillary plants, water treatment, filter or CO2 plants as well as small and medium-sized breweries, {{since the middle of}} 2010.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{researchers}} have mentioned the storage effect {{in urban areas}} with transportation corridors created by cut and <b>fill.</b> <b>Culverted</b> <b>fills</b> may be converted to impoundments if the culverts become blocked by debris, and flow may be diverted along streets. [...] Several studies have looked into the flow patterns and redistribution in streets during storm events and the implication on flood modelling.|$|R

50|$|Initially, the {{two main}} toll roads over the Sierras that were {{improved}} and developed were the Henness Pass Route from Nevada City, California to Virginia City, Nevada and the Placerville Route, (also called Johnsonss Cutoff and the Tahoe Wagon Road) from Placerville, California to Lake Tahoe and over the Carson range to Virginia City. The Placerville route {{would be the first}} route that could be kept at least partially open even in winter. The Henness Pass route was partially built by a $25,000 grant from Marysville and Nevada City. The Placerville route was somewhat shorter at about 100 mi and had the additional advantage that freight could be shipped to Folsom, California about 23 mi out of Sacramento on the Sacramento Valley Railroad—built in 1856. This freight could then be transferred onto wagons that had good roads to Placerville and later clear to Virginia City. In their heyday from about 1861-1866, these roads had major improvements made at many thousands of dollars per road and paid the salaries of a small army of employees that worked on building and maintaining different sections of the road and the service centers located roughly every ten miles. A typical wage then was from $1.00 to $2.00/day for laborers, teamsters etc., with higher wages when men were scarce. The miners in Virginia City were paid the very high wage of $4.00/day. A team could be hired for a few dollars/day. The storm-induced and spring runoff gullies and ruts in the roads would have <b>to</b> be <b>filled</b> in, <b>culverts</b> installed, streams and canyons bridged, gravel hauled in <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> the soft spots in the road, rough spots evened out and road cuts made in the side hills to get around the hills. The only tools available to build and maintain roads then were hand tools: picks, shovels, crow bars, hoes, axes, wheelbarrows, hand saws, etc. used with a lot of human sweat. This was aided by judicious use of black powder to eliminate really bad spots. The only power available was human, ox or mule pulled plows, wagons and mule powered dump carts. The railroads would be built with essentially the same tools. Every spring, extensive repairs costing additional thousands would be needed to repair the ravages of winter and the gully washing spring thaws.|$|R
