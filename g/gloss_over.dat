5|$|In their {{histories}} of Somerset County Cricket Club, Peter Roebuck and David Foot mostly <b>gloss</b> <b>over</b> the season; Roebuck includes a scorecard, but provides only two paragraphs of prose, while Foot only mentions {{the loss of}} first-class cricket.|$|E
5|$|In {{distinguishing}} {{the police}} characters from other television detectives, Simon {{makes the point}} that even the best police of The Wire are motivated not by a desire to protect and serve, but by the intellectual vanity of believing they are smarter than the criminals they are chasing. However, while many of the police do exhibit altruistic qualities, many officers portrayed on the show are incompetent, brutal, self-aggrandizing, or hamstrung by bureaucracy and politics. The criminals are not always motivated by profit or a desire to harm others; many are trapped in their existence and all have human qualities. Even so, The Wire does not minimize or <b>gloss</b> <b>over</b> the horrific effects of their actions.|$|E
5|$|Æthelwig's {{relationship}} with Wulfstan, when Wulfstan was {{acting as the}} abbot's diocesan bishop, {{appears to have been}} tense, for on the only recorded visitation by Wulfstan to Evesham during Æthelwig's abbacy, Æthelwig was not there. Although in legal matters Wulfstan and Æthelwig were in conflict, personally, Æthelwig is said to have regarded Wulfstan as a father figure, and as the abbot's confessor. The fact that the Evesham's house chronicle appears to have been reworked after 1100 to <b>gloss</b> <b>over</b> embarrassing incidents of the abbots submitting to the bishops of Worcester makes evaluation of Æthelwig's relations with his episcopal superiors more difficult.|$|E

25|$|Confusingly, the {{indirect}} drive approach {{was not made}} widely public until 1993. Documents from the Nova era published in general science magazines and similar materials either <b>gloss</b> <b>over</b> the issue, or imply that Nova was using the direct drive approach, lacking the hohlraum.|$|E
25|$|The {{reality is}} that even though most {{organizational}} work processes are largely designed around documentation, much remains unrecorded, especially that to do with decision-making. The record often reflects the desire to <b>gloss</b> <b>over</b> disagreements and serious questions, or the desire to sell or excuse.|$|E
25|$|One {{issue with}} trials is what {{to use as}} a placebo {{treatment}} group or non-treatment control group. Often this is patients on a waiting list, or people receiving some kind of regular non-specific contact or support. One issue {{is the best way to}} match the use of inert tablets or sham treatments in placebo-controlled studies in pharmaceutical trials. Several interpretations and differing assumptions and language remain. Another issue is the attempt to standardize and manualize therapies and link them to specific symptoms of diagnostic categories, making them more amenable to research. Some report that this may reduce efficacy or <b>gloss</b> <b>over</b> individual needs. Finagy and Roth's opinion is that the benefits of the evidence-based approach outweighs the difficulties.|$|E

500|$|Literary critic Walter Ben Michaels found Spiegelman's racial {{divisions}} [...] "counterfactual". [...] Spiegelman depicts Europeans {{as different}} animal species based on Nazi conceptions of race, but all Americans, {{both black and}} white, as dogs—with {{the exception of the}} Jews, who remain unassimilated mice. [...] To Michaels, Maus seems to <b>gloss</b> <b>over</b> the racial inequality that has plagued the history of the U.S.|$|E
500|$|His primary focus, however, is on Shakespeare's dramatisation of [...] "the {{arguments}} {{for and against}} aristocracy or democracy, on the privileges of the few and the claims of many". Shakespeare shows the weaknesses of both the nobles and the people, but, thought Hazlitt, he was biased somewhat in favour of the nobility, leading him to <b>gloss</b> <b>over</b> their defects more so {{than those of the}} common people.|$|E
500|$|PopMatters {{journalist}} J.C. Maçek III wrote [...] "For {{fans who}} bought the toys, watched the cartoon and read the comics during the ‘80s and now have like-aged {{children of their own}} (all of which I did and do), might I suggest proceeding to watch this fun film with your kids, but compromise so that you can leave the commentary track on. The film will remain a treat for the eyes, but you can more easily <b>gloss</b> <b>over</b> those parts that will make you apologize to your brain." ...|$|E

500|$|On the Parliamentarian side, an {{official}} source was published {{a month after}} the battle; due to the circumstances of its publication and the high Parliamentarian morale after Newbury, it made no attempt to <b>gloss</b> <b>over</b> errors and was designed to [...] "explain to a lay readership what had happened on the battlefield". A more narrow view was taken by Sergeant Henry Foster, who fought with the London Trained Band in their attempt to prevent the Royalists splitting Essex's army. The diary of Walter Yonge of Colyton also contains two reports written for the House of Commons by Essex's generals, including Stapleton, although the originals have been lost.|$|E
500|$|About Amalric's son Baldwin IV, however, [...] "there was no ambiguity". Baldwin {{was nothing}} but heroic {{in the face of}} his {{debilitating}} leprosy, and he led military campaigns against Saladin even while still underaged; William tends to <b>gloss</b> <b>over</b> campaigns where Baldwin was not actually in charge, preferring to direct his praise towards the afflicted king rather than subordinate commanders. William's history can be seen as an apologia, a literary defense, for the kingdom, and more specifically for Baldwin's rule. By the 1170s and 1180s, western Europeans were reluctant to support the kingdom, partly because it was far away and there were more pressing concerns in Europe, but also because leprosy was usually considered divine punishment.|$|E
500|$|The archives, it {{has been}} claimed, gave Richard the names and details of all of Philip's spies and agents in the duchy of Aquitane, as well as Angevin deserters to the French. And at least one {{contemporary}} chronicler, {{it has been}} said, [...] "dwelt lovingly" [...] on the French king's humiliation, whilst, possibly in retaliation, Philip sacked the town of Évreux, which was a possession of Philip's erstwhile ally, John, {{as well as local}} churches. French chroniclers however, and perhaps less surprisingly, tended to <b>gloss</b> <b>over</b> Philip's rout at Fréteval; one covered it in a single sentence. This was not unusual; small skirmishes like Fréteval were often recorded by chroniclers whose side won and ignored by those who lost.|$|E
5000|$|The series also <b>glosses</b> <b>over</b> {{competitions}} {{that were}} not on the Grand Prix or national qualifying competitions. Liang, for example, began her season at the Nebelhorn Trophy, not Skate America.|$|R

500|$|Many critics {{felt that}} the special effects overshadowed other {{elements}} of the film. Canby stated that the film [...] "owes more to [...] than it does to the director, the writers or even the producer". Livingston felt that Trumbull and Dykstra's work on the film was not as impressive as on Star Wars and Close Encounters due to the limited amount of production time. Godfrey called the effects [...] "stunning", but conceded that they threatened to overpower the story two-thirds of the way into the film. Kroll, Martin, and Arnold agreed that the effects were not able to carry the film or <b>gloss</b> <b>over</b> its other deficiencies; [...] "I'm not sure that Trumbull & Co. have succeeded in pulling the philosophic chestnuts of Roddenberry and his co-writers out of the fire," [...] Arnold wrote.|$|E
500|$|A Thousand Splendid Suns {{received}} significant {{praise from}} reviewers, with Publishers Weekly calling it [...] "a powerful, harrowing depiction of Afghanistan" [...] and USA Today describing the prose as [...] "achingly beautiful". Lisa See of The New York Times attributed the book's success to Hosseini [...] " [...] {{the power of}} emotion as few other popular writers do". Natasha Walter from The Guardian wrote, [...] "Hosseini is skilled at telling {{a certain kind of}} story, in which events that may seem unbearable - violence, misery and abuse - are made readable. He doesn't <b>gloss</b> <b>over</b> the horrors his characters live through, but something about his direct, explanatory style and the sense that you are moving towards a redemptive ending makes the whole narrative, for all its tragedies, slip down rather easily." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{its debut}} in the United States, The Seattle Times Melanie McFarland {{wondered}} whether the series would do well, writing: [...] "soft-pedaling through the issues might work for today's family of viewers, but what's gentle enough for Mom and Dad's peace of mind might {{not be enough to}} hook Junior or the original Degrassi's older fans". The issues that the characters experience have often been commented on in the media. It has been noted that the series never attempts to hide from depicting honest accounts of the trials and tribulations that real teenagers may often experience. Sarah Liss from CBC News said that despite often being corny and soap opera-y, Degrassi: The Next Generation tackles issues that other genre series prefer to <b>gloss</b> <b>over,</b> and was part of her essential viewing. She named the series one of [...] "the [...] most important television shows of the 2000s", and was the only children's series, and the only Canadian television series, to appear on the list, which included Mad Men, Lost, the CSI franchise, and Sex and the City.|$|E
6000|$|... p. 107, l. 13. The Cavalier <b>glosses</b> <b>over</b> {{the fact}} that Gustavus Adolphus really retreated from his camp at Nuremberg, being {{practically}} starved out, as Wallenstein refused {{to come to an}} engagement.|$|R

500|$|Jabbari Weekes of Exclaim! said, [...] "A {{majority}} of My Name Is My Names sounds are wrapped in minimalistic saran wrap that allows Pusha T's cold delivery to flourish, with more abstract drug references than a paranoid dealer over a tapped phone line." [...] Reed Jackson, writing for XXL, stated, [...] "Certain songs, like the trap house anthem [...] "No Regrets" [...] or the early-2000s-sounding [...] "Let Me Love You," [...] are entertaining, but don’t have the inventiveness or {{excitement of the}} album’s other tracks. With MNIMN standing at a lean 12 songs, these missteps are hard to <b>gloss</b> <b>over.</b> Regardless, Pusha T accomplishes a lot here, crafting a record that is big in concept but is still rooted in the longstanding hip-hop tradition that lyricism is king." [...] Brandon Soderberg of Spin said, [...] "Don't tell King Push, but My Name Is My Name bears a weird resemblance to Drake's Nothing Was the Same: Here is another deeply considered collection of top-shelf beats and uncompromising-though-still-pop-enough raps that justifies the fairly awful personalities driving it, which, depending on your tolerance for wounded narcissism and a complete lack of insight, is either fascinating or frustrating." ...|$|E
500|$|Bridges' view of [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] {{was taken}} up by H. W. Garrod in his 1926 {{analysis}} of Keats's poems. As Albert Gerard would argue later in 1944, Garrod believed that the problem within Keats's poem was his emphasis on the rhythm and the language instead of the main ideas of the poem. When describing the fourth stanza of the poem, Maurice Ridley, in 1933, claimed, [...] "And so comes the stanza, with that remarkable piece of imagination at the end which feels the light as blown by the breezes, one of those characteristic sudden flashes with which Keats fires the most ordinary material." [...] He later declared of the seventh stanza: [...] "And now for the great stanza in which the imagination is fanned to yet whiter heat, the stanza that would, I suppose, by common consent be taken, along with Kubla Khan, as offering us the distilled sorceries of 'Romanticism'". He concluded on the stanza that [...] "I {{do not believe that}} any reader who has watched Keats at work on the more exquisitely finished of the stanzas in The Eve of St. Agnes, and seen this craftsman slowly elaborating and refining, will ever believe that this perfect stanza was achieved with the easy fluency with which, in the draft we have, it was obviously written down." [...] In 1936, F. R. Leavis wrote, [...] "One remembers the poem both as recording, and as being for the reader, an indulgence." [...] Following Leavis, Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren, in a 1938 essay, saw the poem as [...] "a very rich poem. It contains some complications which we must not <b>gloss</b> <b>over</b> if we are to appreciate the depth and significance of the issues engaged." [...] Brooks would later argue in The Well-Wrought Urn (1947) that the poem was thematically unified while contradicting many of the negative criticisms lodged against the poem.|$|E
2500|$|With {{regard to}} his own writing, Diaz has said: [...] "There {{are two types of}} writers: those who write for other writers, and those who write for readers," [...] and that he prefers to keep his readers in mind when writing, as they'll be more likely to <b>gloss</b> <b>over</b> his {{mistakes}} and act as willing participants in a story, rather than actively looking to criticize his writing.|$|E
