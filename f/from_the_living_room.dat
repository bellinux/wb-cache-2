25|$|Parker {{made his}} last public {{appearances}} in 1994. By this point, {{he was a}} sick man who could barely leave his own house. On January 20, 1997, Parker's wife heard a crashing sound <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> and when she heard no response to her calls, she went in to find him slumped over in his chair. He had suffered a stroke.|$|E
25|$|Master {{craftsman}} Elias Concepcion {{has been}} credited with {{the execution of the}} interior finishes. His handling of the ornamental elements ranges from the curvilinear and stylized floral motifs present in the stained glass of the double doors, to the rectilinear wood screen—reminiscent of the arts and craft movement– dividing the foyer <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> As with the exterior, the interior is a mixture of distinct stylistic elements. The vestibule's repousse sheet metal ornamentation reflects the roccoco treatment of the exterior, at once maintaining an image of opulence and refinement for the visitor while creating a transitional device for the predominantly planar interior surfaces. Many highstyle interiors of the beginning of the 20th century in the Ponce and Yauco region have been attributed to Elias Concepcion due to his sophisticated integration and subtle resolution of an eclectic vocabulary.|$|E
50|$|The {{interiors}} {{were finished}} smooth with plaster and were rarely painted. Over time {{changes were made}} to the housing units; Querns, braziers and mortars appeared in the floors. Recesses in walls were also put to good use as cupboards. The kitchen was separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> and <b>the</b> upper levels were used for granaries and/or workshops.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a large}} caravanserai {{towards the}} west of the site. Soft clay stones and burnt clay bricks have been used in its construction.

25|$|The {{interior}} {{of the house was}} much smaller than the year before. The living room was brought back inside the house, with two glass doors separating it from the main floor area. On Launch Night, McCall said the room will change colour depending on what mood the housemates were in, however the walls only changed colour on eviction nights. The bedroom was across <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> and featured a waterbed, the bathroom was accessed through the bedroom, and featured a bath, shower and also a toilet. The kitchen was small and beside the door leading to the garden. In the garden, which was much larger than the house, was a barbecue, a pool, a seating area and a bridge titled The Bridge to Nowhere which led to another seating area. The interior stairs remained closed off once again, and had a yellow and black theme.|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 25, 1910. The film had a wide national release, known advertising theaters include those in Nebraska, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Indiana, Montana, and Oklahoma, The New York Dramatic Mirror was neutral to slightly praising the production. The reviewer stated, [...] "It is a discursive narrative, not bound by laws of cause and effect, although it does not contradict them. It is amusing to see the rapidity with which a motion picture hero goes West. He throws a toothbrush and his pajamas into a suitcase, takes his hat over his arm, and breaks the news to his father before stepping <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> out into the street. The special point of this film is the aviation exhibition, which is well handled. The hero is a very jocose gentleman, who smiles broadly with and without provocation. Other parts are adequately filled." [...] The Moving Picture World spared three roughly three sentences surrounding {{the focus of the}} plot, [...] "A love story built up around the invention of a new type of aeroplane. The machine flies and the inventor gets the girl of his choice. The picture has, therefore, a pleasant ending." ...|$|E

25|$|Freed from {{smoke and}} dirt, <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> thus began {{to serve as}} an area for social {{functions}} and increasingly became a showcase for the owner's wealth. In the upper classes, cooking and the kitchen were the domain of the servants, and the kitchen was set apart <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms,</b> sometimes even far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dining room. Poorer homes often did not have a separate kitchen yet; they kept the one-room arrangement where all activities took place, or at the most had the kitchen in the entrance hall.|$|R
50|$|In June 2008, {{after several}} months of writing and pre-production, Garth and Miller {{traveled}} to Eugene, OR, met with sound engineer Mike “Lazer” Lavin, and the band entered Gung-Ho Studio. Gung-Ho provided the duo with access to high-end studio equipment, vintage instruments, and a change of environment <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> and storage sheds. Garth would later recall, “Most of the record was recorded in Eugene, Oregon, to have that rainy influence” which helped give the album a “more psychedelic-y” sound.|$|R
2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire on the back porch. She {{thought she was going}} to be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom near the front of the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. She heard the killer coming through the kitchen window, so she turned around and ran through the dining room, through the bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then into the living room and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|E

The booth's inward-facing seat is the inner side of the mezzanine's parapet. In Wright's drawings, the outer face of the mezzanine's parapet has planters with greenery visible <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> These would freshen the air, and green complements the red and brown of Wright's materials. Plants here would even be visible outside, through the large windows, and would unify the garden outside with the garden inside.|$|R
50|$|Another {{feature of}} the Uthland-Frisian houses is the stable door or Klöntür. This door is divided horizontally, so that the upper half can be opened independently, for example, in order to {{ventilate}} the room. The closed lower half prevents the small animals, that were often kept around <b>the</b> house, <b>from</b> entering <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> half-open door is ideal for chatting to neighbours, an activity known in Sylt Frisian as Klöön (Low German Klönen); hence {{the name of this}} type of door.|$|R

50|$|The mansion was renovated {{and updated}} from 1991 through 2013, with {{priority}} in preserving its artistic, material, workmanship integrity, while upgrading and modernizing its infrastructure.

25|$|Integration {{with the}} setting extends even to small details. For example, where glass meets stone walls no metal frame is used; rather, {{the glass and}} its {{horizontal}} dividers were run into a caulked recess in the stonework so that the stone walls appear uninterrupted by glazing. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> cantilevered <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> a stairway leads directly down to the stream below, and in a connecting space which connects the main house with the guest and servant level, a natural spring drips water inside, which is then channeled back out. Bedrooms are small, some with low ceilings to encourage people outward toward the open social areas, decks, and outdoors.|$|R
50|$|The {{property}} {{never had}} a floor plan. The house {{is in the form}} of a one story bungalow. Toward the sea, the building presents a long unbroken front, <b>from</b> which <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and dining room look out upon the great expanse of shaded lawn to the Pacific. On the north side, toward the mountains and the entrance road, a wing turns back at one end, enclosing, in the terrace angle with a long, low-pitched roof. This north side, being not over a couple of hundred feet <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rear roadway, is sheltered and screened. To the south, however, the great oaks are the only growth that breaks the great sweep of lawn between the thickly planted border lines. The dining room features view windows.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> Ellwood House <b>living</b> <b>room</b> did {{not exist}} until Perry Ellwood's 1911 remodeling. <b>The</b> {{original}} <b>living</b> <b>room</b> space was laid out as two rooms with pocket doors joining them. In <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> a wall between the sitting room was removed which created a large, open space to which a vaulted ceiling was added. Perry Ellwood's <b>living</b> <b>room</b> was designed to function with the newly added sunroom and south terrace as one large living and entertaining space. The terrace can be accessed through French doors <b>from</b> both <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and sunroom. <b>The</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> was designed to reflect English country houses c. 1650, during the Stuart period. The room was designed by Roy Terwilliger, an interior designer with Marshall Field & Company in Chicago and May Ellwood's cousin. <b>The</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> features a [...] "pargework" [...] ceiling constructed of molded plaster and designed with a geometric theme. The large, Caen stone [...] fireplace was carved in Chicago in 1911. The sunroom was designed in the late 19th century and early 20th century Arts and Crafts style causing it to stand {{in stark contrast to}} <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> room was originally furnished with Mission style furniture to complement the oak woodwork.|$|R
