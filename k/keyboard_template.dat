50|$|Although Timex Computer Corporation {{folded in}} February 1984, the {{independent}} Portuguese division continued {{to sell the}} machine in Portugal as the Timex Computer 2068, and Poland until 1989, as the Unipolbrit Komputer 2086. Although the Portuguese-made TC2068 was also sold in Poland, only the UK2086 was actually made there.Timex of Portugal sold 2 versions of TC2068: the Silver TC2068 version came with a ZX Spectrum emulator cartridge and a black TC2068 version sold with TimeWord word processing cartridge plus the Timex RS232 Interface to use TimeWord with a RS232 printer. Strangely the black version came with a silver <b>keyboard</b> <b>template</b> with TimeWord commands {{to be used with}} the program. It can be removed because it is not glued to the black <b>keyboard</b> <b>template.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Like its mid-1980s competitor, MultiMate, WordPerfect used {{almost every}} {{possible}} combination of function keys with Ctrl, Alt, and Shift modifiers. This was {{in contrast to}} early versions of WordStar, which used only Ctrl, in conjunction with traditional typing keys. (CP/M, WordStar's original platform, {{did not support the}} Alt key.) Many people still know and use the function key combinations from the DOS version, which were originally designed for Data General Dasher VDUs that supported two groups of five plain, shift, control, and control shift function keys. This was translated to the layout of the 1981 IBM PC keyboard, with two columns of function keys at the left end of the keyboard, but worked even better with the 1984 PC AT keyboard with three groups of four function keys {{across the top of the}} keyboard. With the 1981 PC keyboard, the Tab key and the related F4 (Indent) functions were adjacent. This plethora of keystroke possibilities, combined with the developers' wish to keep the user interface free of [...] "clutter" [...] such as on-screen menus, made it necessary for most users to use a <b>keyboard</b> <b>template</b> showing each function. WordPerfect used F3 instead of F1 for Help, F1 instead of Esc for Cancel, and Esc for Repeat (though a configuration option in later versions allowed these functions to be rotated to locations that later became more standard).|$|E
40|$|A {{keyboard}} {{has many}} function keys and each function key can have multiple functions when used with control, shift and alt keys, {{it is difficult}} for a user to remember the functionality of the function keys. We need a mechanism to indicate the operations assigned to each function key for different software programs. A <b>keyboard</b> guide or <b>template</b> is used for this purpose. This article illustrates 10 inventions on keyboard key guide and function key templates selected from US patent database. Various mechanisms of <b>keyboard</b> <b>templates</b> have been proposed, including static, dynamic, manual, mechanical, onscreen display and others.

50|$|IBM PCjr, late 1984: Published by IBM in {{hard plastic}} case. The <b>keyboard</b> overlay <b>template</b> is {{replaced}} with a small strip for use with the non-chiclet replacement keyboard. Not compatible with Tandy 1000 machines with more than 128K of memory.|$|R
2500|$|The next studio album, World Machine, was {{released}} in 1985. By this time, the band had moved on from their original pure jazz-funk sound towards a much more mainstream pop/R'n'B sound, with King's bass and Lindup and Badarou's chugging <b>keyboards</b> serving as <b>templates</b> for pop songs such as [...] "Something About You" [...] and [...] "Leaving Me Now", which were both UK Top 20 hits (Top 40 hits in the Netherlands).|$|R
