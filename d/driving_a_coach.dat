2500|$|In August 1852, Gage {{was invited}} to Chile {{to work as a}} long-distance stagecoach driver there, [...] "caring for horses, and often <b>driving</b> <b>a</b> <b>coach</b> heavily laden and drawn by six horses" [...] on the ValparaisoSantiago route. After his health began to fail in mid-1859, he left Chile for San Francisco, {{arriving}} (in his mother's words) [...] "in a feeble condition, having failed very much since he left New Hampshire... Had many ill turns while in Valparaiso, especially during the last year, and suffered much from hardship and exposure." [...] In San Francisco he recovered under the care of his mother and sister, who had relocated there from New Hampshire around the time he went to Chile. Then, [...] "anxious to work", he found employment with a farmer in Santa Clara.|$|E
60|$|You may talk vaguely about <b>driving</b> <b>a</b> <b>coach</b> and six up a {{good old}} flight of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the balustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a {{locomotive}} hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.|$|E
6000|$|The Heckman home, {{which the}} campers called [...] "the Castle," [...] or [...] "The Manor House," [...] a long, two-story {{building}} of stone which {{stood on the}} southern end of the Bluff, overlooked what had once been Black Hawk's Happy Hunting Ground. It was not in any sense a château, but it pleased Wallace Heckman's artist-tenants to call it so, and by contrast with their cook-house it did, indeed, possess something like grandeur. Furthermore [...] "the Lord of the Manor" [...] added to the majesty of his position by owning and <b>driving</b> <b>a</b> <b>coach</b> (this was before the day of the automobile), and at times those of his tenants most highly in favor, were invited to a seat on this stately vehicle.|$|E

50|$|In 1866 shepherd, Cornelius O’Brien {{discovered}} a gold bearing quartz outcrop. Within weeks, large parties of miners from the Lambing Flats and Forbes diggings arrived.

A few months later, Grenfell was proclaimed on January 1, 1867 after Gold Commissioner, John Granville Grenfell, who was wounded by bushrangers near Narromine on December 7, 1866. John Granville Grenfell was <b>driving</b> <b>a</b> <b>coach</b> at the time and refused to stop when bushrangers called him to. He was shot twice in the groin and died 24 hours later. Between 1867 and 1869 over 40,000 ounces of gold were produced each year on the Grenfell goldfields and were the richest gold fields in NSW during this time.|$|E
50|$|A buggy whip is a horsewhip {{with a long}} stiff {{shaft and}} a {{relatively}} short lash used for driving a horse harnessed to a buggy or other small open carriage. A coachwhip, usually provided with a long lash, is used in <b>driving</b> <b>a</b> <b>coach</b> with horses in front of other horses. Though similar whips are still manufactured for limited purposes, the buggy whip industry as a discernible economic entity ceased to exist {{with the introduction of}} the automobile, and is cited in economics and marketing as an example of an industry ceasing to exist because its market niche, and the need for its product, disappears. In discussing market regulation, it is often held that the economy would be disadvantaged as a whole if the automobile had been banned to protect the buggy-whip industry.|$|E

A lot of footage of these touring-years can be seen on the home video the band released in Summer 2000. Pyogenesis started a three-day fan-travel along with the release of the home video, where 50 dedicated fans and the band members were <b>driving</b> in <b>a</b> <b>coach</b> from spot to spot, such as a visit of the editorial office of the Visions Magazine, a concert in an abandoned mining pit or the recording of a TV show with the band.|$|R

5000|$|The {{business}} of a coachman (or coachee, formerly coacher) was {{to drive a}} coach. He was also called a [...] or jarvie, especially in Ireland; Jarvey was a nickname for Jarvis. If he drove dangerously fast or recklessly he was a jehu (from Jehu, king of Israel, who was noted for his furious attacks in a chariot (2 Kings 9:20), or a Phaeton (from Greek Phaethon, son of Helios, who attempted to drive the chariot of the sun but managed to set the earth on fire). A postilion or postillion sometimes rode as a guide on the near horse of a pair or {{of one of the}} pairs attached to a coach, especially when there was no coachman. A guard on a horse-drawn coach was called a shooter.Traveling by coach, or pleasure driving in a coach, as in a tally-ho, was called coaching. In <b>driving</b> <b>a</b> <b>coach,</b> the coachman used a coachwhip, usually provided with a long lash. Experienced coachmen never used the lash on their horses. They used the whip to flick the ear of the leader to give them the office to move on, or cracked it next to their heads to request increased speed. Coachmen and coach passengers might have worn a box coat, a heavy overcoat with or without shoulder capes, used by coachmen riding on the box seat exposed to all kinds of weather. A hammercloth, ornamented and often fringed, sometimes hung over the coachman's seat, especially on a ceremonial coach.|$|E

6000|$|Charles {{prepared}} manifestoes for the Press, and was urged, from England, {{to include}} certain arranged words in them, {{to be taken}} as a sign that he was actually landed. These words, of course, were to be kept a dead secret. The English Jacobites had no intention of appearing in arms to aid a French invading force, if Charles was not in the midst of it. Alexander Murray wrote suggestions for Charles's Declaration. He was to be very strong on the Habeas Corpus Act, and Murray ruefully recalled his own long imprisonment by order of the House of Commons. He wished also to repudiate the National Debt, but Charles must not propose this. 'A free Parliament' must take the burden of the deed. 'The landed interest can't be made easy by any other method than by paying that prodigious load by a sponge.' In a Dutch caricature of 'Perkin's Triumph' (1745), Charles is represented <b>driving</b> in <b>a</b> <b>coach</b> over the bodies of holders of Consols. It is difficult now to believe that Repudiation was the chief aim of the honest squires who toasted 'the King over the Water.' ...|$|R
50|$|With the {{delivery}} of the DB Class 614 in the early 1970s the Saale Valley Railway received its first modern railway vehicles during the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) era.

After a short time when old railbuses visited the line, the modern diesel multiple units of DBAG Class 642 became their successors.|$|R

He will not talk to me about <b>driving</b> <b>a</b> mail <b>coach</b> like that foolish baronet, nor tell me the price of all his wines like your uncle." [...] Nor would Ferdinand Lopez do so, thought Emily to herself. [...] "But in all such matters, my dear, the great thing is like to like.

Happerton was the best, but what had he to say for himself? I've always thought that there was very little wit wanted to make a fortune in the City." [...] In this frame of mind Mr. Wharton went off to bed, but not a word more was spoken about Ferdinand Lopez.|$|R
50|$|Growing up in a naval family, Foust {{spent several}} years {{as a child in}} Scotland, where he {{discovered}} rally racing and learned to drive on the country roads near his home.

He spent his summers at the track, trading seat time in racecars for mechanic work and driver coaching jobs. After college, he began working as <b>an</b> ice <b>driving</b> <b>coach,</b> <b>an</b> instructor at automotive marketing events and competing in anything he could, including rally and drifting. He made the transition to professional racing in 2003, and soon moved to California to begin stunt driving for Hollywood films.

6000|$|A terrific {{multitude}} of plans {{of what he}} might do and in particular of what he might buy, came crowding into his brain, {{and he did not}} so much fall asleep as pass into a disorder of dreams in which he was <b>driving</b> <b>a</b> four-horse Tip-Top <b>coach</b> down Sandgate Hill ("I shall have to be precious careful"), wearing innumerable suits of clothes, and through some terrible accident wearing them all wrong. Consequently he was being laughed at. The coach vanished {{in the interest of the}} costume. He was wearing golfing suits and a silk hat.
