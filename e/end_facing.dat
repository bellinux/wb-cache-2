40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{research}} and master the effect of surface topography on average film thickness between the <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> for mechanical seals, average film thickness fractal model between the <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> for mechanical seal was established using fractal parameters charactering surface topography characteristics, based on contact fractal model of the <b>end</b> <b>face</b> for mechanical seal, and solving micro-void volume. Effect of surface topography fractal parameters on average film thickness between the <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> for B 104 a- 70 mechanical seal was analyzed by theoretical calculation. The results showed that fractal dimension D and characteristic length scale G of the <b>end</b> <b>face</b> had a great influence on the average film thickness h 0, and h 0 decreased with the increased of D or decreased of G; h 0 decreased rapidly with the increased of D or with the decreased of G when the <b>end</b> <b>face</b> was coarser, however, it decreased slowly with the increased of D or with the decreased of G when the <b>end</b> <b>face</b> was smoother. In normal working parameters and surface topography fractal parameters range, average film thickness between <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> was {{in the range of}} 0. 27 ~ 1. 7 µm. Studying on the effect of the change of surface topography on average film thickness has an important significance on the predicting of operating characteristics of <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> during actual operating and the design of <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> for contact mechanical seal...|$|R

This fort was named San Andres in honour of Mendoza's colleague, the Cardinal Margrave Andrew of Burgau. Maurice exerted himself to hinder the progress of Fort San Andres with a bombardment; the Spanish though constructed two bastions towards the Waal, two towards the Maas, and a fifth inland, with connecting curtains with the rivers serving as a ditch. Maurice planted guns on the opposite bank, and there was a heavy cannonade, but for many days the two armies were comparatively inactive.|$|E
25|$|The West 5th Street Depot {{was located}} at the {{northwest}} corner of West 5th Street and Surf Avenue in Coney Island, Brooklyn, adjacent to the Brighton Beach neighborhood, and across from the current New York Aquarium, as well as near the former Luna Park amusement park. It was originally the site of a railroad and trolley terminal called the Culver Depot, built by the Prospect Park and Coney Island Railroad, operators of the Culver surface line along present-day McDonald Avenue in 1875. This depot was built on Surf Avenue between West 5th Street and West 8th Street, serving surface railroad and later Brighton and Culver elevated trains, as well as streetcars. The terminal also served the streetcar lines of the competing Coney Island and Brooklyn Railroad, including its Smith Street Line. A second adjacent facility on West 5th Street, also known as the Smith Street Trolley Depot, was built by the Coney Island and Brooklyn Railroad in 1912 exclusively for streetcars. Both streetcar companies as well as the Culver and Brighton lines would become part of the BRT by middle of the decade. By 1920, all elevated trains were moved west to the BRT's West End Depot, and the original Culver terminal was razed in 1923, with all streetcar service going to the West 5th Street Depot. As a streetcar facility, it featured a concrete storage garage at its north end, and a two-floor passenger terminal building at its south <b>end</b> <b>facing</b> Surf Avenue, with seven track loops {{in the center of the}} complex for terminating streetcars. The passenger concourse featured a restaurant, and a carousel which would later be moved to Manhattan to become the Central Park Carousel. The depot would be absorbed into municipal operations during unification in 1940.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Mechanical seal <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> are {{separated}} by a thin fluid film. The thickness of this film must be optimized so as to preventing the serious friction of two <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> and minimizing the fluid leakage. The micro scope condition monitoring of <b>end</b> <b>face</b> is of importance to ensure mechanical seals run normally. A method for measuring the film thickness of <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> and detecting the friction of <b>end</b> <b>faces</b> of mechanical seal has been presented in this paper. Eddy current sensors embedded in the stationary ring of mechanical seals are used to directly measure {{the thickness of the}} liquid-lubricated film. The Eddy current signal is decomposed by empirical mode decomposition into a series of intrinsic mode function. The information reflecting the film thickness is obtained by eliminating the false intrinsic mode function components. Acoustic emission sensor placed on the lateral of stationary ring i...|$|R

The slow process of passing a constitutional amendment ensured that the Reactionary Party would control the government at least until 1842, when Araújo Lima's term as regent would <b>end.</b> <b>Facing</b> fierce resistance from Liberals—the Chamber sessions had become embroiled in heated, often chaotic, debates—Honório Hermeto withdrew his proposal.

2500|$|Engineers {{often use}} dyes in water or smoke in air {{in order to}} see streaklines, from which pathlines can be calculated. Streaklines are {{identical}} to streamlines for steady flow. Further, dye can be used to create timelines. The patterns guide their design modifications, aiming to reduce the drag. This task is known as streamlining, and the resulting design is referred to as being streamlined. Streamlined objects and organisms, like steam locomotives, streamliners, cars and dolphins are often aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The Streamline Moderne style, an 1930s and 1940s offshoot of Art Deco, brought flowing lines to architecture and design of the era. [...] The canonical example of a streamlined shape is a chicken egg with the blunt <b>end</b> <b>facing</b> forwards. [...] This shows clearly that the curvature of the front surface can be much steeper than the back of the object.
