25|$|CD-4 LPs contain two sub-carriers, one in {{the left}} <b>groove</b> <b>wall</b> and {{one in the}} right <b>groove</b> <b>wall.</b> These sub-carriers use special FM-PM-SSBFM (Frequency Modulation-Phase Modulation-Single Sideband Frequency Modulation) and have signal {{frequencies}} that extend to 45kHz. CD-4 sub-carriers could be played with any type stylus as long as the pickup cartridge had CD-4 frequency response. The recommended stylus for CD-4 as well as regular stereo records was a line contact or Shibata type.|$|E
2500|$|In this system, each of two stereo {{channels}} {{is carried}} independently by a separate <b>groove</b> <b>wall,</b> each wall face moving at 45 {{degrees to the}} plane of the record surface (hence the system's name) in correspondence with the signal level of that channel. By convention, the inner wall carries the left-hand channel and the outer wall carries the right-hand channel. [...] While the stylus only moves horizontally when reproducing a monophonic disk recording, on stereo records the stylus moves vertically as well as horizontally. During playback, the movement of a single stylus tracking the groove is sensed independently, e.g., by two coils, each mounted diagonally opposite the relevant <b>groove</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
2500|$|An off-center {{stamping}} {{will apply}} a slow 0.56Hz modulation to the playback, affecting pitch {{due to the}} modulating speed that the groove runs under the stylus. The effect becomes gradually more acute during playback as the stylus moves closer {{to the center of}} the record. It also affects tonality because the stylus is pressed alternately against one <b>groove</b> <b>wall</b> and then the other, making the frequency response change in each channel. This problem is often called [...] "wow", though turntable and motor problems can also cause pitch-only [...] "wow".|$|E
25|$|Another {{problem with}} shellac {{was that the}} size of the disks tended to be larger because it was limited to 80–100 <b>groove</b> <b>walls</b> per inch before the risk of groove {{collapse}} became too high, whereas vinyl could have up to 260 <b>groove</b> <b>walls</b> per inch.|$|R

2500|$|Thin, closely spaced {{spiral grooves}} {{that allow for}} {{increased}} playing time on a rpm microgroove LP lead to a tinny pre-echo warning of upcoming loud sounds. The cutting stylus unavoidably transfers some of the subsequent groove wall's impulse signal into the previous <b>groove</b> <b>wall.</b> It is discernible by some listeners throughout certain recordings, but a quiet passage followed by a loud sound will allow anyone to hear a faint pre-echo of the loud sound occurring 1.8 seconds ahead of time. This problem can also appear as [...] "post"-echo, with a tinny ghost of the sound arriving 1.8 seconds after its main impulse.|$|E
2500|$|The LP is delicate. Any {{accidental}} {{fumbling with}} the stylus or dropping {{of the record}} onto a sharp corner can scratch the record permanently, creating a series of [...] "ticks" [...] and [...] "pops" [...] heard at each subsequent playback. Heavier accidents can cause the stylus {{to break through the}} <b>groove</b> <b>wall</b> as it plays, creating a permanent skip that will cause the stylus to either skip ahead to the next groove or skip back to the previous groove. A skip going to the previous groove is called a broken record; the same section of 1.8 seconds of LP (1.3s of 45rpm) music will repeat over and over until the stylus is lifted off the record. It is also possible to put a slight pressure on the headshell causing the stylus to stay in the desired groove, without having a playback break. This requires some skill, but is of great use when, for instance, digitizing a recording, as no information is skipped.|$|E
2500|$|The Boyd {{ranch house}} is a two-story {{rectangular}} structure measuring 26 by [...] [...] The main entrance is on the south side. [...] It is a wood-frame structure with a gable roof and brick chimney. [...] The original batten board siding was covered by shingles in 1914. [...] The structure was originally built on a post and sill foundation; however, it was placed on a concrete slab when it was relocated in 1979. [...] The first floor includes a living room and a bedroom from the building’s original construction plus a kitchen, a bathroom, and a side porch which were added in 1914. [...] The interior board walls are covered with painted paper. [...] Fir planks are used for flooring. [...] Windows and doors are simple and have no molding. [...] There are two bedrooms upstairs. [...] Both rooms have tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>wall</b> paneling. [...] In the 1930s, a front porch was added next to the kitchen. [...] In the 1950s, the kitchen was remodeled and the main picture window {{in the living room}} enlarged. [...] The original cooking stove, piano, and many other Boyd family furnishing remain in the house.|$|E
50|$|In any {{multi-layer}} spooling application it {{is important}} that when the rope is first installed on the drum, it is done so under tension to avoid any slack on inner layers that can be crushed or nicked against the <b>groove</b> <b>walls</b> by outer layers.|$|R

5000|$|Two {{researchers}} at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Drs. Vitaliy Fadeyev and Carl Haber have {{been experimenting with}} an audio restoration method which involves taking a very high definition digital photographic image of the vintage recording medium. They use a precision optical metrology system (designed to scan silicon detectors) to form {{an image of the}} groove on a 78 rpm record. After processing the digital file, they have an audio stream that represents the variations in the <b>groove</b> <b>walls,</b> allowing them to 'play' the record virtually without using a phonograph stylus. 2D images can be made more quickly and have proved worthy of further investigation on 78 rpm discs cut laterally. A 3D method is possible, though it takes much longer for the photographic survey of the recording and it requires much more storage space for the larger digital file. 3D methods are required for non-flat media such as [...] "hill-and-dale" [...] recordings (an early vertical cutting method by Pathé), Edison cylinders and Dictabelt rolls. 3D imaging is required for stereo phonograph records in order to capture the full detail of both inner and outer <b>groove</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{floorplan}} {{consists of}} rooms opening off a central hallway with archways and a central domed skylight {{with a light}} shaft above. Internally, the building has cedar panelled doors with fanlights, architraves and skirtings, rendered masonry walls, plaster ceilings with decorative roses and timber floors with floor coverings. All principal rooms have fireplaces, of which only the front two rooms operate and have marble surrounds. The northwest room has been refitted as the kitchen. The west addition has single-skin tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R
50|$|Along {{with this}} audio, a {{separate}} 30 kHz carrier was recorded on each <b>groove</b> <b>wall.</b> The carrier {{on each side}} carried the difference signal for that side. This was the information that enabled a combined signal to be resolved into two separate signals.For the left carrier it would be left front minus left back, and for the right carrier {{it would be the}} right front minus the right back.|$|E
50|$|Internally {{at ground}} floor level the {{original}} tongue and <b>groove</b> <b>wall</b> boarding has been covered with plasterboard. Ceilings {{at this level}} have been clad in plaster board in the front section and the original exposed timber truss and tongue and groove boarded ceilings remain in the rear section. The original staircase {{to the first floor}} has been retained and the ceiling at this level is an exposed truss system with timber tongue and groove boarding.|$|E
50|$|The {{direct metal}} {{mastering}} technology addresses the lacquer mastering technology's issue of pre-echoes during record play, caused by the cutting stylus unintentionally transferring some of the subsequent groove wall's impulse signal into the previous <b>groove</b> <b>wall.</b> In particular, a quiet passage followed by a loud sound often clearly revealed a faint pre-echo of the loud sound occurring 1.8 seconds ahead of time (the duration of one revolution at 33 rpm). This problem could also appear as post-echo, 1.8 seconds after a peak in volume.|$|E
40|$|Forced {{convective}} heat transfer of turbulent flow in a two-dimensional channel mounted triangular and trapezoidal obstacles in upper wall and bottom wall arranged with periodic grooves is numerically studied. Continuity, momentum and energy equations are discretized with second order upwind method {{is applied to}} solve the equations. (RNG) k-ε model is implemented to predict the thermo-hydraulic performance of the flow. A thick of 3 mm made up by aluminum is implemented for channel walls that the bottom and upper walls are heated with a uniform heat flux.

50|$|Beveled {{retaining}} rings feature a 15° beveled or angled edge. This angle allows the ring to wedge itself between the groove and the retained part until {{it can go}} no farther, effectively “locking” everything in place. Think of placing a cork in a bottle. The cork is forced into the opening until it is wedged as far into the opening as possible. The same thing happens when a beveled retaining ring is installed into an application. The ring is wedging itself into place between the <b>groove</b> <b>wall</b> and the retained part, resulting in what {{is referred to as}} rigid end-play take-up.|$|E

5000|$|In 1926, {{an attempt}} at {{reviving}} interest in Edison records was made by introducing a long-playing Diamond Disc which still rotated at 80 rpm but tripled the standard groove pitch to 450 threads per inch by using an ultra-fine groove, achieving a playing time of 24 minutes per 10-inch disc (12 on each side) and 40 minutes per 12-inch disc (these were the only 12-inch Diamond Discs ever sold to the public). A special reproducer and modified feed screw mechanism were required to play them. There were problems with skipping, <b>groove</b> <b>wall</b> breakdown, and overall low volume (about 40% of that of the regular Diamond Discs). Only 14 different [...] "Edison Long Play" [...] discs were issued before they were discontinued.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantages}} of DMM (hard surface material) over acetate lacquer cutting (soft surface material) are both sonic and practical: {{because of the}} rigidity of the master disc medium, no <b>groove</b> <b>wall</b> bounce-back effects take place after the cutting has been completed. This preserves the original modulation details in the groove walls much better, especially those involved with sudden fast attacks (transients). The improved transient response, {{as well as the}} more linear phase response of DMM improve the overall stability and depth-of-field in the stereo image. In addition, disturbing adjacent groove print-through sounds (groove echoes) are reduced in DMM. Also, {{there is no need to}} rush the finalized master disc directly into a refrigerator for groove preservation, as in conventional lacquer disc cutting, before processing the master disc to produce matrices for the pressing of the records.|$|E
