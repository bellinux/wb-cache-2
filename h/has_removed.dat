5|$|According to Angharad Llwyd (a 19th-century {{historian}} of Anglesey), the first church on {{this site was}} reportedly established in about 616. No part of any 7th century building survives, and restoration over the years <b>has</b> <b>removed</b> much historical evidence for the church's development.|$|E

5|$|The fern {{thrives in}} thin {{serpentine}} soils on sunny, disturbed habitats such as roadcuts and talus slopes, in dunite and other ultramafic rocks. Anthropogenic disturbance <b>has</b> <b>removed</b> thicker soils and increased sun exposure {{in many of}} these sites; for instance, many of the Quebec stations are in asbestos mines, both abandoned and active. In more natural habitats, frost weathering and erosion may promote rock fall and maintain suitable habitat.|$|E
5|$|Craven and Jedburgh escape Northmoor {{but both}} are dying from {{radiation}} poisoning. Jedburgh makes for the Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland, which is hosting a NATO conference on directed energy weapons. Also {{present at the}} conference is Grogan who announces that the British government has approved the purchase of IIF and speaks with cold passion of harnessing {{the power of the}} atom to conquer the galaxy. The audience of military and civilian officials applauds but Jedburgh in U.S. uniform takes the dais to denounce nuclear proliferation and a vainglorious crusade amongst the stars. He finishes by bringing together two bars of plutonium he <b>has</b> <b>removed</b> from Northmoor, causing a criticality accident and irradiating himself and the nearby Grogan.|$|E
5|$|Graham {{travels to}} the first crime scene in Birmingham, Alabama, where he is {{contacted}} by Crawford, who tells him of Lounds' tabloid story on the case. Crawford also patches Graham through to Frederick Chilton, Lecktor's warden, who has found a note in Lecktor's personal effects. Reading it, they realize {{it is from the}} Tooth Fairy, expressing admiration for Lecktorâ€”and an interest in Graham. Crawford brings Graham to the FBI Academy at Quantico, where a missing section of the note is analyzed to determine what Lecktor <b>has</b> <b>removed.</b> It is found to be an instruction to communicate through the personals section of the National Tattler, Lounds' newspaper.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, the runways, parking ramp and other {{features}} of Tamiami Airport were still visible on campus and clearly discernible in aerial photos. Construction <b>has</b> <b>removed</b> all of these features, and only the University Tower remains as a memory of the university's past. University Park is a lush, heavily vegetated campus, with many lakes and a 15-acre nature preserve, {{as well as a}} palm arboretum and has over 90 buildings. As of late 2009, current construction at University Park includes the Nursing and Health Sciences Building, the School of International and Public Affairs Building, and a fifth parking garage.|$|E
5|$|World War II {{prompted}} {{major changes}} in Southern Rhodesia's financial and military policy, and accelerated the process of industrialisation. The territory's participation in the EATS brought about major economic and infrastructural developments {{and led to the}} post-war immigration of many former airmen, contributing to the growth of the white population to over double its pre-war size by 1951. The war remained prominent in the national consciousness for decades afterwards. Since the country's reconstitution as Zimbabwe in 1980, the modern government <b>has</b> <b>removed</b> many references to the World Wars, such as memorial monuments and plaques, from public view, regarding them as unwelcome vestiges of white minority rule and colonialism. Southern Rhodesia's dead of the war today have no official commemoration, either in Zimbabwe or overseas.|$|E
5|$|The John Day River, which {{passes through}} the Sheep Rock Unit, is the longest undammed {{tributary}} of the Columbia River, although two Columbia River dams below the John Day River mouth impede migratory fish travel to some degree. Chinook salmon and steelhead pass through the monument {{on their way to}} and from upstream spawning beds and the Pacific Ocean. Species observed at the Sheep Rock Unit also include those able to tolerate warm summer river temperatures: bridgelip suckers, northern pikeminnow, redside shiners, and smallmouth bass. From October through June, when the water is cooler, Columbia River redband trout and sculpin are among species that move downriver through the park. The Park Service <b>has</b> <b>removed</b> or replaced irrigation diversions along the river or Rock Creek that formerly impeded fish movement, and it is restoring riparian vegetation such as black cottonwood trees that shade the water in summer and provide habitat for aquatic insects.|$|E

5|$|The exact {{systematic}} {{placement of}} the king vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear. Though both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and Old World vultures evolved from different ancestors {{in different parts of}} the world. Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The South American Classification Committee <b>has</b> <b>removed</b> the New World vultures from Ciconiiformes and instead placed them in Incertae sedis, but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible. Like other New World vultures, the king vulture has a diploid chromosome number of 80.|$|E

5|$|The territory's {{contributions}} {{during the}} First World War {{became a major}} entry in many histories of the colony, and {{a great source of}} pride for the white community, as well as for some black Rhodesians. It played a part in the UK government's decision to grant self-government in 1923, and remained prominent in the national consciousness for decades. When the colonial government unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965, it deliberately did so on Armistice Day, 11 November, and signed the proclamation at 11:00 local time. Since the territory's reconstitution and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, the modern government <b>has</b> <b>removed</b> many references to the war, such as memorial monuments and plaques, from public view, regarding them as unwelcome vestiges of white minority rule and colonialism. The Zimbabwean cultural memory has largely forgotten the First World War; the country's war dead today have no official commemoration, either there or overseas.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{receives}} a short call from Duncan {{just as the}} FBI agents track Duncanâ€™s location. Veronica goes into an abandoned apartment, where she meets Duncan. It {{turns out that the}} set of events that seemed to point towards Duncan having stolen the baby were a scam so that Veronica and Duncan could successfully smuggle Duncan and the baby to Mexico together. Sheriff Lamb learns this fact just as Keith finds diapers in the apartment. A reporter contacts Wallace. Sheriff Lamb goes down to Mexico and asks around for Duncan Kane. Keith confronts Veronica about her actions regarding the baby, angry that she used him and tells her he'll never be able to fully trust her again. The FBI agents search Veronicaâ€™s apartment, but Keith <b>has</b> <b>removed</b> the diapers and continues to claim he doesn't know anything. Weevil learns that Felix was dating Molly Fitzpatrick. Sheriff Lamb continues his search before finding his trunk unloaded. Duncan, disguised as a hitchhiker, gets picked up by Vinnie Van Lowe and Astrid (Celesteâ€™s assistant), and they drive off into the distance.|$|E

5|$|US2 enters Michigan from Wisconsin for {{the first}} time north of {{downtown}} Hurley, Wisconsin, and Ironwood, Michigan, over the state line that runs along the Montreal River. The highway crosses the river into Gogebic County and passes a welcome center on the way into a commercial district north of downtown. Running along Cloverland Drive, US2 meets its only business route in Michigan at Douglas Boulevard. The business route was previously a full loop that ran west through downtown Ironwood and crossed the border into Hurley and back to the main highway. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation <b>has</b> <b>removed</b> the signage on their side of the border, which reduced the loop to a business spur that ends at the state line. US2 continues eastward through UP woodlands to the city of Bessemer. While bypassing the community of Ramsay, the highway crosses a branch of the Black River. The roadway enters Wakefield {{on the south side of}} Sunday Lake, meeting Mâ€‘28 at a stoplight in town. As the US Highway leaves Wakefield, it turns southeasterly through the Ottawa National Forest, crossing Jackson Creek and two branches of the Presque Isle River. US2 and Mâ€‘64 merge and run concurrently over the second branch of the Presque Isle in the community of Marenisco. This concurrency has the lowest traffic volume along the entire length of the highway within the state; in 2010 the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) recorded a daily average usage along the stretch of 770vehicles, compared to the overall average of 5,188vehicles for the highway. At the end of the concurrency, Mâ€‘64 turns northerly to run along Lake Gogebic.|$|E
