5|$|Marine {{research}} at Dalhousie {{has become a}} large focus of the university, {{with many of the}} university's faculty members involved in some form of marine research. Notably, Dalhousie is the headquarters of the Ocean Tracking Network, a research effort using implanted acoustic transmitters to study fish migration patterns. Dalhousie houses a number of marine research pools, a wet laboratory, and a benthic flume, which are collectively known as the Aquatron laboratory. Dalhousie is one of the founding members of the Halifax Marine Research Institute, founded on 2 June 2011. The institute, which is a partnership between a number of private industries, government, and post-secondary institutions, was designed to help increase the scale, quality, <b>internationalization</b> and impact of marine research in the region. In 2011, the university, along with WWF-Canada, created the Conservation Legacy For Oceans, which aimed at providing scholarships, funding, curriculum development, and work placements for students and academics dedicated to marine research, law, management, and policy making.|$|E

25|$|With the {{emigration}} {{went along}} the <b>internationalization</b> of Logical Empiricism. Many {{former members of}} the Vienna Circle and the Berlin Circle emigrated to the English-speaking world where they had an immense influence on the development of philosophy of science. The unity of science movement for the construction of an International Encyclopedia of Unified Science, promoted mainly by Neurath, Carnap, and Morris, is symptomatic of the <b>internationalization</b> of Logical Empiricism, organizing numerous international conferences and the publication of the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science.|$|E

25|$|The <b>internationalization</b> of the Chinese economy {{continues}} to affect the standardized economic forecast officially launched in China by the Purchasing Managers Index in 2005. By 2009, China became the sole Asian nation to have a GDP (PPP) above the $10-trillion mark (along with the United States and the European Union). By the end of 2015, China became the world's first ever nation to have a GDP (PPP) above the $20-trillion mark, doubling its overall output in the fastest time possible (six years). As China's economy grows, so does China's Renminbi, which undergoes the process needed for its <b>internationalization.</b> China initiated {{the founding of the}} Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in 2015.|$|E

25|$|Another {{aspect of}} the <b>internationalization</b> of banking has been the {{emergence}} of international banking consortia.

Multinational banks can and do make huge international transfers of capital not only for investment purposes but also for hedging and speculating against exchange rate fluctuations.|$|E

25|$|The pontificate of Paul VI {{continued}} {{the opening and}} <b>internationalization</b> of the Church started under Pius XII. He implemented the reforms of John XXIII and Vatican II. Yet, unlike these popes, Paul VI faced criticism throughout his papacy from both traditionalists and liberals for steering a middle course during Vatican II and during the implementation of its reforms thereafter. He expressed a desire for peace during the Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|Following the <b>Internationalization</b> of the renminbi, on 30 November 2015, the IMF {{voted to}} {{designate}} the renminbi {{as one of}} several main world currencies, thus including it in the basket of special drawing rights. The RMB became the first emerging market currency {{to be included in}} the IMF’s SDR basket on 1 October 2016. The other main world currencies are the United States dollar, euro, British pound, and Japanese yen.|$|E
25|$|With that decision, <b>internationalization</b> {{of the war}} was avoided, {{though it}} was desired by the Venezuelan {{president}} Cipriano Castro (who recognized Uribe Uribe as President of Colombia). Conservative troops commanded by Marroquín managed to reduce Venezuelan aid to the Liberals (July 29), who at this time were suffering defeats by the Conservative General Juan B. Tovar. General Uribe saw that the Liberals {{would not be able to}} defeat the Conservatives, and therefore was inclined to surrender, albeit with certain conditions.|$|E
25|$|Given the {{increased}} <b>internationalization</b> of cuisines and food supply, foie gras is increasingly found in hot preparations {{not only in}} the United States, but in France and elsewhere. Duck foie gras ("foie gras de canard") has slightly lower fat content and is generally more suitable in texture to cooking at high temperature than is goose foie gras ("foie gras d'oie"), but chefs have been able to cook goose foie gras employing similar techniques developed for duck, albeit with more care.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s and 1970s Woodstock {{began to}} rethink its composition, purpose, and {{philosophy}} as an institution. The school consciously shifted its conception {{from that of}} a missionary school to a school consisting of an international student body, staff, and curriculum, with a strong Indian cultural component. This change to a truly international school was led by Robert Alter, Principal from 1968 to 1978. With the increasing <b>internationalization</b> of the student body, an English as a Second Language (ESL) program was established in 1978.|$|E
25|$|UVA {{experienced}} significant triumphs of both {{academia and}} athletics in 2015 as Science found its faculty to have discovered {{two of the}} world's top ten scientific breakthroughs that year, and the athletics department was awarded the Capital One Cup for fielding the nation's top overall men's sports program. In the same year, Charlottesville (largely because of UVA founders and funders) was named the No. 1 fastest growing U.S. metropolitan area for venture capital, and UVA won the 2015 Paul Simon Award for Comprehensive <b>Internationalization</b> {{on the basis of}} its global citizen initiatives.|$|E
25|$|The <b>internationalization</b> of the Russian Mafia {{along with}} the Sicilian Mafia, the Camorra, the Triads and the Yakuza played {{a vital role in}} the {{development}} of transnational crime involving Russia. From 1991 to 1992, the number of both officially reported crimes and the overall crime rate increased by 27%. By the early 1990s, theft, burglary, and other property crimes accounted for nearly two-thirds of all crime in the country. There was a rapid growth of violent crime, including homicides. However, since the beginning of the 2000s, crime in Russia has taken a sharp decline.|$|E
25|$|After the <b>internationalization</b> of the Armenian Question, and the Treaty of Berlin that {{followed}} in 1878, {{the idea of}} a self-governing Armenian nation became a possibility. Thus, census records of the Armenian population became important. The first record of the General Population Administration under sultan Abdul Hamid was half the figure in 1881–82. The Ottoman Empire lost Batumi, Kars and Ardahan in 1877–78. The Armenian population statistics for those regions would have influenced the losses of Armenian population but can not account for the other million or more Armenians that are missing in the records of 1881–82 under the reign of Hamid.|$|E
25|$|Today, many {{commonly}} encountered Taiwanese proper names (places and people) {{are written}} in Wade–Giles (a historic semi-official system), Chinese postal romanization (the system most used by Western academics until the <b>internationalization</b> of Hanyu Pinyin in the 1980s), or Gwoyeu Romatzyh (a system that records tones without tone marks). After a long debate, Hanyu Pinyin, the official romanization system used in the People's Republic of China, was planned to be the nationwide standard in Taiwan for 2009. While the national government and many provinces and cities adopted Hanyu Pinyin, several cities continue to use Tongyong pinyin. Examples being, Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second most populous city, and Taichung.|$|E
