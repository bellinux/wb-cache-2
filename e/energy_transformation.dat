25|$|In {{many cases}} the flow leaving {{centrifugal}} impeller is near the speed of sound. The flow then typically flows through a stationary compressor causing it to decelerate. These stationary compressors are actually static guide vanes where <b>energy</b> <b>transformation</b> takes place. As described in Bernoulli's principle, this reduction in velocity causes the pressure to rise leading to a compressed fluid.|$|E
25|$|Work can be {{extracted}} also from bodies colder than the surroundings. When {{the flow of}} energy is coming into the body, work is performed by this energy obtained from the large reservoir, the surrounding. A quantitative treatment {{of the notion of}} energy quality rests on the definition of energy. According to the standard definition, Energy {{is a measure of the}} ability to do work. Work can involve the movement of a mass by a force that results from a transformation of energy. If there is an <b>energy</b> <b>transformation,</b> the second principle of energy flow transformations says that this process must involve the dissipation of some energy as heat. Measuring the amount of heat released is one way of quantifying the energy, or ability to do work and apply a force over a distance.|$|E

2500|$|Entropy {{has often}} been loosely {{associated}} {{with the amount of}} [...] or disorder, or of chaos, in a thermodynamic system. The traditional qualitative description of entropy is that it refers to changes in the status quo of the system and is a measure of [...] "molecular disorder" [...] and the amount of wasted energy in a dynamical <b>energy</b> <b>transformation</b> from one state or form to another. In this direction, several recent authors have derived exact entropy formulas to account for and measure disorder and order in atomic and molecular assemblies. One of the simpler entropy order/disorder formulas is that derived in 1984 by thermodynamic physicist Peter Landsberg, based on a combination of thermodynamics and information theory arguments. He argues that when constraints operate on a system, such that it is prevented from entering one or more of its possible or permitted states, as contrasted with its forbidden states, the measure of the total amount of [...] "disorder" [...] in the system is given by: ...|$|E

40|$|Energetics of the {{observed}} and simulated global circulation are evaluated in the zonal spectral domain for the special observing periods of FGGE. The study utilizes GLA analyses of FGGE observational data and parallel simulation experiments. There are noticeable differences in <b>energy</b> <b>transformations</b> between the observation and simulation during SOP- 1. These include the baroclinic conversion C(n) by the zonal mean motion and short-wave disturbances, and the nonlinear wave-wave interaction L(n) at the long and short waves. The <b>energy</b> <b>transformations</b> of the short-wave disturbances are much more intense in the simulated circulation than in the observation. However, good agreement is noted in the conversion and dissipation of kinetic energy in the large- and cyclone-wave range n = 1 - 10.

At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements.

From this view, in contrast with that outlined by Ohta, energy quality is upgraded in the multistage trophic conversions of ecological systems.
