5|$|Amazon {{lost three}} in the battle and six in her wreck, with 15 wounded, while Indefatigable did not lose a single man killed, {{suffering}} only 18wounded. The discrepancy in losses during the action is likely due to the extreme difficulty the French crew had in aiming their guns given their ship's instability <b>in</b> <b>heavy</b> seas.|$|E
5|$|By February 1916, all of {{the lower}} casemates for her six-inch guns had been plated over and six {{of them had been}} remounted on the upper deck so they could be used <b>in</b> <b>heavy</b> weather. Several twelve-pounders had to be removed {{to make room for the}} six-inch guns.|$|E

5|$|Embroidery styles for smock-frocks {{varied by}} region, {{and a number}} of motifs became {{traditional}} for various occupations: wheel-shapes for carters and wagoners, sheep and crooks for shepherds, and so on.

25|$|The 112 and 114 are {{conventional}} layout monoplanes {{with the}} main wing set low and a mid-mounted horizontal stabilizer. This places the stabilizer outside the prop wash, and results <b>in</b> <b>heavier</b> handling at lower speeds.|$|R
5|$|In Rugrats, {{the root}} of Jewish themes stem from Boris and Minka Kropotkin, the Russian Jewish {{maternal}} grandparents of infant Tommy Pickles.

Tommy and the Pickles family therefore partake in several Jewish activities throughout the series, particularly through holidays.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>heavy</b> rain, Baker {{took off}} and began to level off at 600 feet. A {{quarter of a mile}} into the flight, the engine failed. The plane was {{generally}} easy to crash-land if necessary, something he had done previously at the cost of a few broken ribs.|$|E

5|$|November 16, 1994- Tropical Storm Gordon makes {{landfall}} near Fort Myers. The storm drops {{heavy rainfall}} across the southern {{portion of the}} state, including over 16inches (406mm) in Broward County. The rainfall results <b>in</b> <b>heavy</b> agricultural damage, and throughout the state Gordon causes 8casualties and around $400million in damage (1994USD, $582million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|October 7, 2005- Tropical Storm Tammy {{contributes}} to the Northeast U.S. flooding of October 2005, which results <b>in</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall of up to 5.3inches (134mm) in Lincoln. The rainfall causes drainage problems and crop damage.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to essential oils obtained by steam distillation, oleoresins abound <b>in</b> <b>heavier,</b> less volatile and lipophilic compounds, such as resins, waxes, fats and fatty oils.
