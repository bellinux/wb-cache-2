2500|$|Another issue {{can arise}} {{in regard to}} the capital-labor ratio in the global population. Freeman (2010) holds that the new {{entrants}} to the global workforce since the 1980s brought little capital with them, either because they were poor or because the capital they had was of little economic value. He estimates that the entry of China, India and the Eastern Bloc <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>global</b> <b>economy</b> cut the global capital-labor ratio to around 55–60% of what it otherwise would have been. The capital-labor ratio, according to Freeman, is a critical determinant of the wages paid to workers and of the returns to capital. The more capital each worker has, the higher will be their productivity and pay. Even considering the high savings rate of new entrants—he cites World Bank estimates that China has a savings rate of 40% of GDP—he estimates it would take 30 or so years for the world to re-attain the capital-labor ratio among the countries that had previously made up the global economy. [...] This, along with the effects of the Great Recession, could mean that downward pressure on wages and compensation, particularly in more advanced economies, will continue for the foreseeable future.|$|E
