40|$|Resistance spreads {{rapidly in}} {{pathogen}} or pest populations exposed to biocides, such as fungicides and antibiotics, {{and in many}} cases new biocides are in short supply. How can resistance be reversed in order to prolong the effectiveness of available treatments? Some key parameters affecting <b>reversion</b> <b>of</b> resistance are well known, such as the fitness cost of resistance. However, the population biological processes that actually cause resistance to persist or decline remain poorly characterized, and consequently our ability to manage <b>reversion</b> <b>of</b> resistance is limited. Where do susceptible genotypes that replace resistant lineages come from? What is the epidemiological scale <b>of</b> <b>reversion?</b> What information do we need to predict the mechanisms or likelihood <b>of</b> <b>reversion?</b> Here, we define some of the population biological processes that can drive reversion, using examples {{from a wide range of}} taxa and biocides. These processes differ primarily in the origin of revertant genotypes, but also in their sensitivity to factors such as coselection and compensatory evolution that can alter the rate <b>of</b> <b>reversion,</b> and the likelihood that resistance will re-emerge upon re-exposure to biocides. We therefore argue that discriminating among different types <b>of</b> <b>reversion</b> allows for better prediction of where resistance is most likely to persist...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} {{the implications of}} menu cost models for the rate <b>of</b> <b>reversion</b> to purchasing power parity. Recent menu cost models (Ball and Mankiw, 1994) imply that higher inflation is correlated with more rapid price adjustment. This means that reversion to PPP may be more rapid, the greater the rate of inflation. In order to test this proposition, PPI-deflated real exchange rates are examined {{to see if the}} rate <b>of</b> <b>reversion</b> to PPP is a function of inflation. Another implication, due to both Delgado (1991) and Greenwald and Stiglitz (1989), is that higher exchange rate volatility is associated with slower rates <b>of</b> <b>reversion.</b> I find that both of these propositions hold in panel data, although the second proposition is less robust...|$|R

The dataset included 90 patients with RC and genotypic data from virus samples collected at 0 (baseline), 2 and 4 months of STI. Rapid shift towards wild-type RC was observed during the first 2 months of STI. Median RC increased from 47. 5 % at baseline to 86. 0 % at 2 months and to 97. 5 % at 4 months. Between baseline and 2 months of STI, T 215 F had the fastest rate <b>of</b> <b>reversion</b> (41 %) and the <b>reversion</b> <b>of</b> E 44 D and T 69 D was associated with the largest changes in RC. Among the most prevalent RT mutations, M 184 V had the fastest rate <b>of</b> <b>reversion</b> from baseline to 2 months (40 %), and its reversion was associated with the largest increase in RC. Most rates <b>of</b> <b>reversion</b> increased between 2 months and 4 months, but the change in RC was more limited as it was already close to 100 %.

We {{have shown that}} HSPGs present at the plasma membrane are expressed in myoblasts and are downregulated during muscle differentiation. An exception is glypican- 1, which is present throughout the myogenic process. Myoblasts that do not express glypican- 1 exhibit defective differentiation, {{with an increase in}} the receptor binding of FGF- 2, concomitant with increased signaling. Glypican- 1 -deficient myoblasts show decreased expression of myogenin, the master gene that controls myogenesis, myosin, and the myoblast fusion <b>index.</b> <b>Reversion</b> <b>of</b> these defects was induced by expression of rat glypican- 1. Glypican- 1 is the only HSPG localized in lipid raft domains in myoblasts, resulting in the sequestration of FGF- 2 away from FGF- 2 receptors (FGFRs) located in nonraft domains. A chimeric glypican- 1, containing syndecan- 1 transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, is located in nonraft domains interacting with FGFR-IV- and enhanced FGF- 2 -dependent signaling. Thus, glypican- 1 acts as a positive regulator of muscle differentiation by sequestering FGF- 2 in lipid rafts and preventing its binding and dependent signaling.
