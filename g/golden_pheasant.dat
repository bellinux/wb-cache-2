500|$|In a hybrid, any {{trait that}} falls outside {{the range of}} parental {{variation}} (and is thus not simply intermediate between its parents) is considered heterotic. Positive heterosis produces more robust hybrids, they might be stronger or bigger; while the term negative heterosis refers to weaker or smaller hybrids. Heterosis is common in both animal and plant hybrids. For example, hybrids between a lion and a tigress ("ligers") are much larger than {{either of the two}} progenitors, while [...] "tigons" [...] (lioness Ã— tiger) are smaller. Similarly, the hybrids between the common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) and domestic fowl (Gallus gallus) are larger than either of their parents, as are those produced between the common pheasant and hen <b>golden</b> <b>pheasant</b> (Chrysolophus pictus). Spurs are absent in hybrids of the former type, although present in both parents.|$|E

500|$|The {{division}} was first activated in December 1917 in World War I, and based at Fort Ord, California {{for most of}} its history. Although elements of the division saw brief active service in World War I, it is best known for its participation in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II where it took heavy casualties engaging the Imperial Japanese Army in the Aleutian Islands, Leyte, and Okinawa. Following the Japanese surrender in 1945, the {{division was}} stationed in Japan and South Korea, and with the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 {{was one of the first}} units in action. It took part in the Inchon Landings and the advance north until Chinese forces counter-attacked and almost overwhelmed the scattered division. The 7th later would fight in the Battle of Pork Chop Hill and the Battle of Old Baldy. From 1953 to 1971, the 7th Infantry Division defended the Korean Demilitarized Zone. Its main garrison was Camp Casey, South Korea. During these occupation duties, the division saw a complete reorganization in compliance with the Reorganization Objective Army Divisions plan. The division's former headquarters company grew into the 1st Brigade, 7th Infantry Division while the 13th Infantry Brigade was reactivated as the 2nd Brigade, 7th Infantry Division. The 14th Infantry Brigade was reactivated as the 3rd Brigade, 7th Infantry Division. In 1965 the division received its distinctive unit insignia, which alluded to its history during the Korean War. On 2 April 1971, the division returned to the United States and was inactivated at Fort Lewis, Washington. In October 1974 the 7th reactivated at its former garrison, Fort Ord. [...] In the late 1980s, it briefly saw action overseas in Operation <b>Golden</b> <b>Pheasant</b> in Honduras and Operation Just Cause in Panama. In the early 1990s, it provided domestic support to the civil authorities in Operation Green Sweep and during the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. In 1994, the division was inactivated at Ft. Ord and Ft Ord was closed, as per BRAC rulings. Reactivated in 1999 at Ft Carson, Colorado, where the division's final role was as a training and evaluation unit for Army National Guard brigades, which it undertook until its inactivation in 2006.|$|E

2500|$|Character {{designer}} David Krentz, {{who also}} worked on Disney Animation's Dinosaur (2000), designed about [...] {{for the film}} and worked with 5-6 palaeontologists. The characters were based on creatures found at fossil sites in Alaska and in Canada. Krentz initially designed the creatures in pencil then modeled them with the software ZBrush to send to animators. In addition, palaeontologists provided Animal Logic with technical drawings of dinosaur skeletons so animators could construct the skeletons virtually. The animators collaborated with the palaeontologists to validate the basic movements of the computer-animated dinosaurs. Software was used to overlay muscle to fit the movements. Animal Logic adapted the software Quill, which they used to animate penguin feathers in their work on Happy Feet (2006), into new software called RepTile to animate dinosaur skin and scales. It also added feathers for some dinosaurs, including the Troodons and the Hesperonychus. The color palette and feather pattern of a <b>golden</b> <b>pheasant</b> {{was used for the}} appearance of the Hesperonychus. The natural history unit archives were used to create a [...] "behaviour matrix" [...] that matched dinosaurs' anatomically correct gestures to their moods. Animal Logic ultimately created [...] shots for the film, which director Cook said was a low number for an animated film.|$|E
