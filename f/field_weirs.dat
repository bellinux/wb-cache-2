40|$|Accurate {{estimation}} of discharge capacity and local hydrodynamics are essential when designing hydraulic structures. Instead {{of the application}} of conventionally used empirical relationships, this study introduces a 3 D numerical modeling technique which is capable to adequately predict both the discharge-upstream water level relationship and the flow <b>field</b> around <b>weirs.</b> The numerical model, REEF 3 D, is validated for different hydrodynamic conditions (free-flow and submerged flow) against laboratory data performed for an ogee type weir. Simulated water surface elevations compared with experimental data together with the modeled flow <b>field</b> around the <b>weir</b> suggest that even the complex modular, transition and non-modular submerged cases can be reproduced by the numerical tool. The study proves that the herein applied numerical solver {{can be a good}} alternative of laboratory models for flow analysis at complex hydrodynamic conditions, especially where spatially strongly varying free surface characterizes the flow...|$|R
5|$|McKay initiates an anti-Replicator {{field to}} protect them from the Asurans, but Oberoth (David Ogden Stiers) discovers this and sends a wave to {{override}} the <b>field.</b> <b>Weir</b> leaves McKay, confronts Oberoth and uses his power to freeze all the Asurans, even tricking him into believing that he has captured the team, all to buy Sheppard enough time to upload the programme. However, Weir struggles to keep Asurans frozen, and when Sheppard finds her just as she loses control, she orders him to leave her behind as the Asurans unfreeze and capture her. The team escapes without Weir, but end up trapped as they lack the power to make it to hyperspace. They are unexpectedly assisted by the Apollo, who have found Atlantis with Colonel Carter's (Amanda Tapping) help. The Apollo lays down covering fire long enough for the team to land in the fighter bay and carries them back to Atlantis. However, the Apollo is unable to lock onto Doctor Weir and beam her aboard. Now fully powered, Sheppard sends the city to M35-117, a back-up planet, and makes a rough landing onto its ocean. Whilst the team mourns the loss of Weir, McKay regains contact with Stargate Command. Dr. Zelenka (David Nykl) announces that the Asurans have begun their attack against the Wraith, meaning Weir's sacrifice was not in vain. Carter tells Sheppard that they will miss Weir, though Sheppard vows to find her again.|$|R

2500|$|Carey was a {{respected}} {{official in the}} NFL for his thorough pre-game preparation, professional demeanor, and fair play. In a poll conducted by ESPN in 2008, Carey tied with referee Ed Hochuli for most [...] "best referee" [...] votes among NFL head coaches. He had also ejected the most {{players in the league}} among current referees, as of 2002, including incidents involving Sean Taylor and Terrell Suggs. In his nineteenth year as referee with the 2013 NFL season, Carey's officiating crew consisted of umpire Chad Brown, head linesman Mark Baltz, line judge Tim Podraza, <b>field</b> judge Mike <b>Weir,</b> side judge Doug Rosenbaum and back judge Kirk Dornan.|$|R
5000|$|Wildcatter George McCamey's Baker No. 1 in September 1925 {{opened up}} the McCamey Oil Field, {{established}} the town of McCamey and brought the subsequent oil boom to Upton County. [...] The Yates Oil Field in Crockett and Pecos counties resulted in a financial boon for the town of Rankin, which served as a supply and service center. The resulting financial windfall benefitted infrastructure in Rankin. In 1946, Mike Benedum began wildcatting in Upton County and opened up what would {{become known as the}} Benedum Oil <b>Field.</b> [...] The <b>Weir</b> No. 1 gushed in 1961 and enabled Upton County to continue as an outstanding Texas production area.|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} {{study the effects of}} bendway weirs on bank stability and the mean velocity field in a 90 ° live-bed channel bend. Previous (physical rather than numerical) research has largely been restricted either to fixed-bed experiments or to specific field applications. In this study, nine different experimental cases with and without weirs, but limited to the same flow depth, bend radius of curvature to top width ratio (3. 33), and uniform bed sediment (median diameter, 0. 024 in.), were examined. Three different weir configurations, differing primarily in crest height (50 %, 80 %, and 100 % of the flow depth), were considered; the other characteristics of the bendway <b>weir</b> <b>field</b> were based on FHWA HEC- 23 guidelines. Most {{experiments were}} conducted with the same discharge for various durations up to 48 hours, but the effect of a higher discharge was studied in limited experiments. ^ At selected cross-sections, bed elevations were measured with an acoustic sensor, and mean point velocities were obtained with a side-looking Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter. Comparisons of bed elevations {{at the end of an}} experiment with those at the beginning or with those of the baseline experiment show that the upper regions of the outer bank remain susceptible to bank erosion. Even for the longer duration experiments, equilibrium in the sense of stable banks was not necessarily achieved. In contrast to the mean velocity field in the absence of weirs, where the largest velocities in the downstream half of the channel were typically found near the free surface region of the outer bank, the velocity <b>field</b> with the <b>weirs</b> present exhibited extensive low-velocity regions near the outer bank and peak velocities in the main channel near the weir toes. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{identification}} and mapping {{of land use}} conflicts in a given area constitute important information for environmental management and {{can be obtained from}} different perspectives. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the conflicts of land use of the watershed Mato Dark, located in Palmeira, SC, using geoprocessing techniques. For analysis physiographic panchromatic aerial photographs were used, interpreted in esterescópio and converted to digital format via the flatbed scanner, identified according to methodology Botero (1977). Based on physiographic map was generated map of land use suitability, fitness classes whose use was determined through use of the Fitness Rating Methodology for Use of State Lands of Santa Catarina. For the mapping of the use and occupation of land was used Quick Bird satellite image, the classes of land use were mapped in ArcGIS software: annual crop, forest, <b>field,</b> reforestation; <b>weir.</b> The suitability maps and use and occupation of land constituted different information layers and overlapping of these plans, generated map of land use conflicts in the study area. The predominant physiographic unit in the area was the colluvial erosional slope, with ability to use the land for predominant class 2 slope and susceptibility to erosion. There were no conflicts of use in the area, only the presence of underutilized areas and restriction, requiring soil management practices. Pages: 207 - 21...|$|R
40|$|Broad-crested side weirs {{have been}} the subject of {{numerous}} hydraulic studies; however, the flow <b>field</b> at the <b>weir</b> crest and in front of the weir in the approach channel still has not been fully described. Also, the discharge coefficient of broad-crested side weirs, whether slightly inclined towards the stream or lateral, still has yet to be clearly determined. Experimental research was carried out to describe the flow characteristics at low Froude numbers in the approach flow channel for various combinations of in- and overflow discharges. Three side weir types with different oblique angles were studied. Their flow characteristics and discharge coefficients were analyzed and assessed based on the results obtained from extensive measurements performed on a hydraulic model. The empirical relation between the angle of side weir obliqueness, Froude numbers in the up- and downstream channels, and the coefficient of obliqueness was derived...|$|R
40|$|A {{description}} is given of {{the installation of}} prefabricated, timber, flat-vee weirs to measure the discharge rates in the principal runoff streams from waste rock dumps at the abandoned mine site at Rum Jungle, Northern Territory. Details are presented of the tapping point, stilling well, stilling well/tapping point connection and the technique used to measure gauge height. The relationship between discharge rate and gauge head for the weir structure installed is discussed. The high gradient and high silt load of the run-off streams have led to silt deposition behind the weirs. Information is given on the silt levels and their effect of the discharge/gauge head relationship. The total error on the discharge from uncertainties in stream bed depth, uncertainties in the discharge coefficient and uncertainties in the measured gauge height, {{is estimated to be}} less that 10 % in the range 5 x 10 - 2 m 3 s- 1 to 0. 9 m 3 s- 1, the upper rate being just greater than the maximum discharge rate observed. The error on the total discharge in an event, a parameter of interest in estimating runoff coefficients and total pollution loads, was in general less than this. The weirs have proved robust under <b>field</b> conditions; the <b>weir</b> on White's runoff channel is still in use five years after installation in October 1075, and that on the Intermediate runoff channel, in use three years after installation in November 1977...|$|R
