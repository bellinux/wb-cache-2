40|$|Abstract—Vector {{quantization}} (VQ) is {{a powerful}} method for lossy compression. VQ exploits the statistical redundancy between the samples of sources such as image and speech to reduce the bit rate, this cannot be achieved by the scalar quantization. In VQ, increasing the vector dimensions improves performance but this leads to delay and complexity with encoder. This limitation of VQ can overcome by incorporating memory, one such scheme is finite state vector quantization (FSVQ). In FSVQ partial information of the current block {{can be obtained from}} the previously coded blocks. It uses the next state function to determine the next state based on the present state and output codevactor. This paper presents Matlab simulation results for VQ performance measurements, one for fix vector dimension and variable codebook size and another for <b>fix</b> <b>codebook</b> size and variable vector dimensions for speech and image.

40|$|Abstract — The full {{diversity}} gain {{provided by a}} multi-antenna channel {{can be achieved by}} transmit beamforming and receive combining. This requires the knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter which is difficult to obtain in practice. Quantized beamforming where <b>fixed</b> <b>codebooks</b> known at both the transmitter and the receiver are used to quantize the CSI has been proposed to solve this problem. Most recent works focus attention on limited feedback codebook design for the uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channel. Such designs are sub-optimal when used in correlated channels. In this paper, we propose systematic codebook design for correlated channels when channel statistical information is known at the transmitter. This design is motivated by studying the performance of pure statistical beamforming in correlated channels and is implemented by maps that can rotate and scale spherical caps on the Grassmannian manifold. Based on this study, we show that even statistical beamforming is near-optimal if the transmitter covariance matrix is ill-conditioned and receiver covariance matrix is well-conditioned. This leads to a partitioning of the transmit and receive covariance spaces based on their conditioning with variable feedback requirements to achieve an operational performance level in the different partitions. When channel statistics are difficult to obtain at the transmitter, we propose a universal codebook design (also implemented by the rotation-scaling maps) that is robust to channel statistics. Numerical studies show that even few bits of feedback, when applied with our designs, lead to near perfect CSI performance in a variety of correlated channel conditions.

Our method provides a systematic way for constructing codebooks where codewords are not uniformly distributed, and thus some codewords are more protected than the others.

Section 2 introduces conventional MU-MIMO transmission model and analyzes the problem of low rate <b>fixed</b> <b>codebook</b> feedback scheme.

30|$|Channel {{feedback}} for multi-user (MU)-multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{has been}} widely studied and some results have been got with random vector quantization scheme. However, while the low rate <b>fixed</b> <b>codebook</b> feedbacks are adopted, the performance of zero forcing (ZF) MU-MIMO will decrease as the unpredictable inter-user interference is introduced because of quantized channel state information (CSI). To decrease inter-user interference in low rate <b>fixed</b> <b>codebook</b> feedback, an enhanced user selection switch (USS) feedback scheme for ZF MU-MIMO is proposed in this article. In USS feedback, the extra USS information is added after quantized CSI and received signal-to-noise ratio feedback. The USS information indicates inter-user interference {{and it can be}} used in user selection procedure to avoid large inter-user interference. Simulation results show that the proposed USS feedback scheme is efficient to solve the problems of unpredictable inter-user interference in conventional feedback scheme with low rate codebook in ZF MU-MIMO.|$|E

These two issues are examined on both toy and real world problems of regression and time series prediction.

40|$|Abstract-In an {{uncorrelated}} Rayleigh fading channel, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamforming-combining {{systems can}} attain full diversity and significant array gain using channel knowledge at the transmitter. In {{the absence of}} channel knowledge at the transmitter, a beamforming vector can be quantized at the receiver using a <b>fixed</b> pre-determined <b>codebook</b> of beamforming vectors and the codeword index {{can be sent to}} the transmitter. Designing optimal codebooks (that maximize expected SNR) is an open problem and vector quantization (VQ) and Grassmannian Line Packings (GLP) have been proposed as possible solutions. In this paper, a mutual information based codebook design criterion is introduced and equiangular frames (EF) are proposed as beamforming codebooks satisfying this criterion. Besides providing a systematic way to design codebooks, EFs result in higher receive signal-to-noise ratio compared to codebooks designed using VQ or GLP.

These methods include using extended cost horizon in the <b>fixed</b> <b>codebook</b> search process, as well as joint optimization and delayed decision coding of the adaptive and <b>fixed</b> <b>codebook</b> parameters. Based on our simulations for the IS- 641 speech coder, substantial improvements in terms of objective performance are achieved especially by using delayed decision coding, while the subjective improvements are more marginal. This paper also presents the justification for efficient coding methods based on the distribution of adaptive and algebraic codebook indices in the modified IS- 641 coders, as well as demonstrates the performance improvements achieved by using a shaped lattice structure and adaptive pulse positioning to encode the adaptive and algebraic codebook indices. While the simulations were made using the IS- 641 speech coder or a modified version of it, the results and observations can be generalized to most ACELP and CELP coders.

The resulting optimal beamforming codebook obtained by utilizing a vector quantization (VQ) approach depends on the channel covariance matrix.

RA combines the flexibility and robustness needed for reliable communications with the user terminal under a limited feedback constraint. It responds to two important observations.

40|$|Abstract—Color {{descriptors}} {{are among}} the most important features used in image analysis and retrieval. Due to its compact representation and low complexity, direct histogram comparison is a commonly used technique for measuring the color similarity. However, it has many serious drawbacks, including a high degree of dependency on color codebook design, sensitivity to quantization boundaries, and inefficiency in representing images with few dominant colors. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for color matching that models behavior of the human visual system in capturing color appearance of an image. We first develop a new method for color codebook design in the space. The method is well suited for creating small <b>fixed</b> color <b>codebooks</b> for image analysis, matching, and retrieval. Then we introduce a statistical technique to extract perceptually relevant colors. We also propose a new color distance measure that is based on the optimal mapping between two sets of color components representing two images.
