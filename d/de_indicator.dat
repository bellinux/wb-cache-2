This was concluded from a study on 138 indicators, {{carried out by the}} Centre for Public Health Forecasting at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) on commission of the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine whether data sources would provide usable information on the indicators that the Ministry will use for their products as policy documents. In the study, information from data sources was evaluated using three criteria: representativeness, validity and continuity. Depending on the extent to which the information from the data source satisfied the criteria, conclusions could be drawn on whether the data source gives usable or unusable information on the indicator. For about two-thirds of the 138 indicators, data sources were found to provide usable information about the indicators. Problems of continuity pose the most common threat to usability of the information: the information might come from a onetime source, or the continuation of the data source is not guaranteed or the information is not consistently measured over time. Investment by the Ministry would seem to be necessary to ensure usable information on the indicators. Investering in de continuiteit van databronnen is essentieel om bruikbare informatie te verkrijgen en te behouden over indicatoren op het gebied van preventie. Dit blijkt uit een studie over 138 indicatoren die gebruikt zullen worden in producten van het Ministerie van Volksgezondheid, Welzijn en Sport, zoals beleidsnota's. In opdracht van het ministerie heeft het centrum voor Volksgezondheid Toekomst Verkenningen van het Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu (RIVM) getoetst of databronnen bruikbare informatie leveren over deze indicatoren. Hiertoe is informatie uit databronnen beoordeeld op drie criteria: representativiteit, validiteit en continuiteit. Op grond van deze criteria is geconcludeerd of de databron al dan niet bruikbare informatie geeft over <b>de</b> <b>indicator.</b> Voor ongeveer tweederde van de 138 indicatoren bestaat een databron die bruikbare informatie geeft over een indicator. De bruikbaarheid van de informatie komt het vaakst in het geding door problemen met de continuiteit: de informatie komt uit een eenmalige bron, de voortgang van de bron is niet gewaarborgd of de informatie is niet consistent gemeten over de tijd. Investering in de continuiteit door het ministerie lijkt nodig te zijn om bruikbare informatie over de indicatoren te garanderen...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In recent decades, {{financial}} liberalization {{has been}} one of the most important strategies for Asian countries to promote growth. However, debate emerges following several financial crises on whether liberalizing financial markets and allowing for free access to international capital markets, would benefit or impede economic development. The objective of this study is to examine the impact of financial openness on select seventeen Asian economies and answer the three questions: 1. Is there any linkage between financial openness and economic growth for these seventeen Asian countries? 2. Does any of the financial openness pose positive or negative effects? 3. If no direct impact revealed, can financial openness still have growth effect under certain fundamental or institutional conditions? Our main findings are as follows: 1. By employing both de jure and <b>de</b> facto <b>indicators</b> of financial openness, our empirical results indicate that the <b>de</b> facto <b>indicators</b> are associated with growth of Asian economies but <b>de</b> jure <b>indicator</b> does not show statistically significant impact on growth across three methodologies. 2. Furthermore, these growth effects vary among the <b>de</b> facto <b>indicators.</b> According to our empirical results, out of the four de facto financial openness measurements, only one of them, foreign direct investment inflows, influences growth positively whereas three other measures, including foreign direct investment outflows, portfolio investment inflows and outflows exert negative impact on growth. In terms of the view that the growth effect of the financial openness depends on macroeconomic foundations or institutional conditions of an economy, our findings do not support this view due to the estimation results are not robust across five financial openness proxies...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Using the person-oriented approach, we {{determined}} {{the relationships between}} four indicators (restraint and eating, shape, and weight concerns) of disordered eating (DE), {{as measured by the}} self-reported Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), to identify typical DE patterns. We then related these patterns to clinical EDE-Q cut-off scores and emotion dysregulation, depression, self-esteem, and two categories of DE behaviors (≥ 2 or ≤ 1 "yes" responses on the SCOFF questionnaire). METHOD: Typical patterns of DE were identified in a community sample of 1, 265 Swedish adolescents (Mage [*]=[*] 16. 19, SD[*]=[*] 1. 21; age range 13. 5 - 19 years) using a cluster analysis. Separate analyses were performed for girls (n[*]=[*] 689) and boys (n[*]=[*] 576). RESULTS: The cluster analysis yielded a six-cluster solution for each gender. Four of the six clusters for girls and five for boys showed scores above the clinical cut-off on {{at least one of the}} four <b>DE</b> <b>indicators.</b> For girls, the two clusters that scored above the clinical cut-offs on all four <b>DE</b> <b>indicators</b> reported severe psychological problems, including high scores on emotion dysregulation and depression and low scores on self-esteem. In contrast, for boys, although two clusters reported above the clinical cut-off on all four indicators, only the cluster with exceedingly high scores on shape and weight concerns reported high emotion dysregulation and depression, and extremely low self-esteem. Furthermore, significantly more girls and boys in the most problematic DE clusters reported ≥ 2 "yes" responses on the SCOFF questionnaire (as opposed to ≤ 1 response), indicating clear signs of DE and severe psychological difficulties. CONCLUSION: We suspect that the various problematic DE patterns will require different paths back to a healthy diet. However, more research is needed to determine the developmental trajectories of these DE patterns and ensure more precise clinical cut-off scores, especially for boys. Comprehensive understanding of DE patterns might be of use to healthcare professionals for detecting DE before it develops into an eating disorder.

40|$|The {{question}} whether global financial integration is beneficial for everyone remains highly disputed. It is often assumed that financial globalization involves threshold effects, where integration is worthwhile only when certain preconditions are met. However, {{it has also}} been noted that financial account liberalization also brings about considerable additional indirect benefits. These indirect benefits are often the same as the preconditions, such that there exists a complex two-way relationship between financial globalization and the preconditions/additional benefits. Such a relationship can lead to financial globalization traps, where some economies are trapped at a low level stable equilibrium, while others enjoy ever increasing financial integration. In this paper, we use <b>de</b> facto <b>indicators</b> of international financial integration to investigate if the dynamics of financial integration exhibit signs of such thresholds and traps. We present a parametric way of estimating these important parameters, based on recently developed sample splitting and threshold estimation methods.

40|$|It is the {{starting}} point of this chapter that there is no accepted methodology to measure the formal and de facto independence of independent regulatory authorities, even if some {{progress has been made in}} this field, and that empirical research on the subject, consequently, is scarce and very fragmented. To the extent that they exist at all, studies tend to concentrate on measuring formal independence, since specific legal provisions can be identified and assessed much more easily than the de facto expression of independence. This chapter will introduce the different approaches to measuring formal and de facto independence that have been proposed and critically reflect their potential and limitations, especially for comparative research. Two aspects specific to the audiovisual media sector are particularly relevant in this respect: 1. the objective of regulation in the media sector to guarantee media freedoms and 2. the specific and sometimes sensitive relationship between the media sector and the public authorities (i. e. the media as ‘fourth state power’). Subsequently, this chapter introduces a ranking tool which has been developed specifically to measure the risk of influence by external players, rather than one to measure the level of independence of the regulators themselves. This enables a more objective method for ranking the indicators.

Sticky cards indicated a trend that field margins with hedgerows support a higher ratio of natural enemies to pests compared with weedy borders. Hedgerow plant species hosted different relative densiti es of a generally overlapping insect community, and the timing and intensity of bloom only explained a small proportion of the variation in insect abundance at plant species and among hedgerows, with the exception of Orius spp. on Achillea millefolium L. and Baccharis pilularis <b>De</b> Candolle. <b>Indicator</b> Species Analysis showed an affinity of parasitic wasps, especially in the super-family Chalcidoidea, for B. pilularis {{whether or not it was}} in flower.

(2015) study skill mismatches by concepts from employing descriptive statistics and comparing the distributional characteristics of requirements and attainments using both vacancy data (EURES) and data of jobholders from the WageIndicator web-survey. They find that mismatches can be identified for about one fourth of the examined occupations on the demand side and one third on the supply side.|$|R
40|$|Damage {{models are}} capable of {{representing}} crack initiation and mimicking crack propagation within a continuum framework. Thus, in principle, they do not describe crack openings. In durability analyses of concrete structures however, transfer properties are a key issue controlled by crack propagation and crack opening. We extend here a one dimensional approach for estimating a crack opening from a continuum based fi nite element calculation to two dimensional cases. The technique operates {{in the case of}} mode I cracking described in a continuum setting by a nonlocal isotropic damage model. We used the global tracking method to compute the idealized crack location as a post treatment procedure. The orig inal one dimensional problem devised in Dufour et al. [4] is recovered as pro fi les of deformation orthog onal to the idealized crack direction are computed. An estimate of the crack opening and an error indicator are computed by comparing fi nite element deformation pro fi les and theoretical pro fi les corresponding to a displacement discontinuity. Two estimates have been considered: In the strong approach, the maxima of the pro fi les are assumed to be equal; in the weak approach, the integrals of each pro fi le are set equal. Two dimensional numerical calculations show that the weak estimates perform better than do the strong ones. Error <b>indicators,</b> <b>de</b> fi ned as the distance between the numerical and theoretical pro fi les, are less than a few percentages. In the case of a three point bending, test results are in good agreement with experimental data, with an error lower than 10 % for widely opened crack (> 40 m m) Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
