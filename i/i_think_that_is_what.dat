Al-Qaeda is a way of working... but this has the hallmark of that approach... al-Qaeda clearly has the ability to provide training... to provide expertise... and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> has occurred here." ...|$|E

She explained, [...] "It {{was something very}} raw, and to be honest, something that I was slightly embarrassed to put up because of the quality but I did anyways, for any of our listeners who would care to hear something not hot off the production belt, but something more organic and 'home made.' It made me feel better to share my feelings with people who could connect, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> happened with many." ...|$|E

[...] "The StarMedia idea of Pan Latin Americanism, an idea with deep {{historical}} roots, was a profound turning point for Latinos across the world." [...] But {{in the spring of}} 2000, StarMedia suffered what the book calls [...] "the near-complete collapse of the Internet economy." [...] By his own calculation, Mr. Espuelas' StarMedia holdings at one point had a value of nearly $500 million, but he never sold a single share. [...] "I lived a full cycle", he tells Hispanic Business. [...] "It was the best business and personal experience I could have had at this point in my life. [...] " ...|$|E

Managing director Mark Price has said that this offer has made Waitrose the second largest provider of coffee in the UK, calling it a [...] "phenomenal" [...] response that showed schemes offering loyalty points to be meaningless. He told The Daily Telegraph: [...] "Giving free coffee or free newspapers is disruptive to the market, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> customers want, I don't think they want a point. I mean, what is a point? I think it's meaningless. It doesn't have the richness, it doesn't have the affinity you can gauge if you engage with your customers in a different way. It is about what do consumers value today, not what did they value historically. So green shield stamps, or points, were a response to what happened post-war [...] [...] [...] I just don't think {{that is where the}} world is now." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Anne slowly, [...] "that I {{really have}} learned to look upon each little {{hindrance}} as a jest and each great one as the foreshadowing of victory. Summing up, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> Redmond has given me." ...|$|E
60|$|SMITH. [With passion, {{pointing}} to the next room.] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> comes of questioning! Why can't you leave the universe alone and let it mean what it likes? Why shouldn't the thunder be Jupiter? More men have made themselves silly by wondering what the devil it was if it wasn't Jupiter.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> no slouch of a compliment--kind of a dim {{religious}} light about it. I {{enjoy that}} sort of thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it {{is indeed}} wonderful," [...] she agreed. [...] "Not all fairies know that sort of magic, but some fairies can do magic that fills me with astonishment. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> makes us modest and unassuming--the fact that our magic arts are divided, some being given each of us. I'm glad I don't know everything, Dorothy, and that there still are things in both nature and in wit for me to marvel at." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then came a sudden, awful silence, as she recollected her audience, and blushed crimson {{with the}} misery of perceiving where her random shaft had struck, nor did either of us know what to say; but to our {{surprise}} it was Clarence who first spoke to relieve the desperate embarrassment. 'Is forgiven quite the right word, when the offence was not personal?

Well, if you let me stay with you, I don't think you will hear any {{complaints}} from me. Charlie Ward, Paddy, and the rest of you, I want you to understand that from this out I am one of yourselves. I'll live as you live and do as you do.|$|E

6000|$|MRS. COADE (undoubtedly hopeful). We mustn't be too sure, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> it. (Primly.) What <b>is</b> {{it exactly}} <b>that</b> you want, Mr. Coade? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{a record}} performance. Of {{course you are}} all looking forward to your first skirmish; I can assure you we are." ...|$|R
60|$|Every child passes {{into this}} secret stage; it closes in from its first frankness; it carries off the growing jewel of its {{consciousness}} {{to hide from}} all mankind.... I think I can see why this should be so, but I cannot tell why in so many cases no jewel is given back again at last, alight, ripened, wonderful, glowing with the deep fires of experience. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> ought to happen; it is what does happen now with true poets and true artists. Someday I {{think it will be}} the life of all normal human souls. But usually {{it does not seem to}} happen at all. Children pass out of a stage--open, beautiful, exquisitely simple--into silences and discretions beneath an imposed and artificial life. And they are lost. Out of the finished, careful, watchful, restrained and limited man or woman, no child emerges again....|$|E

Jennings thinks I had a sun-stroke. I don't know, but my head was so bad, {{whenever}} I moved, that I thought only Jennings would ever have come to tell you about it. Jennings looked after me as if I had been his own son; and there was David too, as kind {{as if he had been}} Richard himself--always sitting by, to bathe my forehead, or, when I was a little better, to talk to me, and ask me questions about his Christian teaching. You must not think of him like a savage, for he is my friend, and a far more perfect gentleman than I ever saw any one, but you, papa, holding the command over his people so easily and courteously, and then coming to me with little easy first questions about the Belief, and such things, like what we used to ask mamma. He liked nothing so well as for me to tell him about King David; and we had learned a good deal of each other's languages by that time. The notion of his heart--like Cocksmoor to Ethel--is to get a real English mission, and have all his people Christians. Ethel talked of good kings being Davids to their line; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> he will be, if he lives; but those islanders have been dying off since Europeans came among them." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Several of {{the central}} bankers {{involved}} had said repeatedly they {{had no intention of}} selling any of their gold, but they had been saying that as individuals—and no-one had taken any notice. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> Mr. Duisenberg meant when he said they were making this statement to clarify their intentions." ...|$|E
