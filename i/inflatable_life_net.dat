40|$|This paper proposescompatibility as an additionalvariable or {{factor that}} {{contributes}} to lifesaving performance of life jackets. In order to support the proposal, a model and seven hypotheses were developed based on previous literatures and accidents reports. The hypotheses are compatibility of life jackets with CPV contributes to the lifesaving performance of a life jacket (H 1); Inherently buoyant life jackets are not compatible to don inside the fully enclosed spaces of CPV (H 2); Inherently buoyant life jackets are compatible to don in open spaces of CPV (H 3), Inherently buoyant life jackets are compatible to don inside the partially enclosed spaces of CPV (H 4), <b>Inflatable</b> <b>life</b> jackets are compatible to don inside the fully enclosed space of CPV (H 5),: <b>Inflatable</b> <b>life</b> jackets are compatible to don in open space of CPV (H 6); and <b>Inflatable</b> <b>life</b> jackets are compatible to don inside the partially enclosed spaces of CPV (H 7). Verification of the hypotheses and model was based on opinion fromthree groups of maritime professional. The opinionswere gathered by a survey questionnaire, and the response was using a five-point Likert Scale. The development of the survey questionnaires were according to standards of IMO. The performed analyses were descriptive analysis, variance analysis, exploratory factor analysis and correlation analysis. Based on the result, the proposed model and hypotheses were supported...|$|R

50|$|On August 19, 1902, the New York City Fire Department {{conducted}} {{its first}} real-life rescue with the Browder <b>life</b> <b>net.</b> During rescue operations at a tenement fire that killed five people, a baby was {{dropped from a}} fourth-floor fire escape into a <b>life</b> <b>net,</b> and survived uninjured. On November 10, 1904, three people were saved when they jumped into a <b>life</b> <b>net</b> during a fire in New York City. Three other people died {{on the top floor}} of the building. In Anchorage, Alaska, in 1957, a woman dropped her three-year-old daughter into a <b>life</b> <b>net,</b> and the girl was uninjured; the mother suffered a broken back after jumping into the net.|$|R
50|$|On May 17, 2011, {{the ship}} {{sustained}} considerable damage to several lifeboats when a fuel loading barge {{collided with the}} side of the ship while in the port of St Petersburg, Russia. After inspection by authorities, it was determined the ship still had enough passenger space in an emergency using <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> rafts, and the ship continued on her planned itinerary.|$|R
50|$|The Coast Guard {{discovered}} {{numerous other}} violations: No fire doors were closed during the blaze. Lifejackets were not stored in every cabin. The ship did not carry three <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> rafts, {{which it was}} required to have by law. There was only one radio operator on board, while the law required two. Passengers had also never been informed of evacuation procedures.|$|R
50|$|In June 2015 Beach {{announced}} {{the development of}} the Lifeshirt, an <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> jacket-type device designed to achieve a Level 50 performance rating established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

50|$|Firefighters {{believed}} that the practical height limit for successful use of <b>life</b> <b>nets</b> was about six stories, although in a 1930 Chicago fire, three people survived jumps from an eighth story into a <b>life</b> <b>net.</b> One suffered a skull fracture, {{and the other two}} had minor injuries.|$|R
5000|$|In 1958, a fire {{department}} official in Eugene, Oregon expressed reservations, {{saying that the}} term [...] "life net" [...] was misleading, {{and that they should}} be used only as a last resort. [...] As late as 1961, though, the Chicago Fire Department still emphasized the <b>life</b> <b>net</b> in its training programs. [...] However, the modern aerial apparatus (a type of aerial work platform) often known as a ladder truck has made the <b>life</b> <b>net</b> obsolete, as this ladder equipment makes it possible for firefighters to carry out rescues more safely, at greater heights and with smaller crews. Adams has concluded that the <b>life</b> <b>net</b> was no longer mentioned after 1983, and writes that they are not discussed in current training manuals for firefighters. [...] Many examples of <b>life</b> <b>nets</b> are on display in firefighting historical museums.|$|R
25|$|Second Officer MacIsaac took {{command of}} the after part of the ship. He got a covered <b>inflatable</b> <b>life</b> raft {{launched}} and ordered Third Officer Meurig Caffery and two other men into it. Teti cast a line to the raft, towed it to safety and transferred {{two of the men}} to another pilot boat. Third Officer Caffery asked Santagata to let him remain aboard Teti to help with the rescue. Caffery looked to be in good condition so Santagata agreed.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Life</b> <b>nets</b> often {{failed to}} save people, and {{sometimes}} firefighters themselves were injured or killed by falling bodies. According to researcher and writer Cecil Adams, [...] "Leapers sometimes struck {{something on the}} way down, landed on a fireman, or missed entirely." [...] In November 1910, a fire swept through a factory in Newark, New Jersey, killing 25 people. Among them were four girls who held onto each other when they jumped into a <b>life</b> <b>net.</b> They tore the net apart and were killed. [...] In the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire on March 25, 1911, girls jumped into <b>life</b> <b>nets</b> from the ninth floor with their arms intertwined and the impact ripped the canvas and tore the springs from the frame, resulting in their deaths. [...] In all, 146 garment workers were killed in that fire. During the Hotel Polen fire in Amsterdam on May 9, 1977, firefighters could not successfully deploy a <b>life</b> <b>net</b> in a narrow, congested alley. When a <b>life</b> <b>net</b> was deployed in a more open area, some hotel guests threw their luggage into the net, and were then injured when they jumped. Others were injured {{when they hit the}} rim of the net. In all, 33 people died in that fire.|$|R
