The low-risk group consisted of the remaining patients. Surgical staging in the high-risk group included pelvic lymphadenectomy with para-aortic lymphadenectomy in selected cases.

Patients with nodal metastases (group C, n = 10) received postoperative irradiation.

Patients and Methods: Three year retrospective analysis of 32 laryngectomized patients with 107 periprosthetic leakage events (PLEs). Custom-made silicone washers (outer diameter 18 mm, inner diameter 7. 5 mm, thickness 0. 5 mm) were placed behind the tracheal flange either in combination with prosthesis replacement or later. Results: There was immediate resolution of periprosthetic leakage in 88 PLEs (median, 38 d; mean, 53 d; range, 8 - 330 d) and in 6 PLEs with the washer still in situ at the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> (median, 75; mean, 97 d; range, 38 - 240 d).

In 29 of 32 (91 %) patients, the washer resolved the problem at least in one PLE successfully. Twelve of 32 patients, including all 3 with washer failures, also required other interventions to ultimately solve the problem.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three thousand ten patients with operable node-positive breast cancer {{were randomly assigned to}} receive adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy with or without docetaxel. Patients who presented human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2) -overexpressing tumors were secondary randomly assigned to either a sequential regimen of trastuzumab (6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) for 1 year or observation. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: Overall 528 patients were randomly assigned between trastuzumab (n = 260) and observation (n = 268) arm. Of the 234 patients (90 %) who received at least one administration of trastuzumab, 196 (84 %) received at least 6 months of treatment, and 41 (18 %) discontinued treatment due to cardiac events (any grade). At the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis</b> (October 2007), 129 DFS events were recorded.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{attempted}} {{to determine the}} effect of unreported on estimates of pacemaker reliability. Background. The reliability of pacemakers is usualty reported with reference to implant registration data and returned product without censoring when follow-up data are missing. Methods. We studied 73 patients (mean [±SD] age 77 ± 8 years) undergoing implantation of a ventricular-inhibited (VVI) pacemaker who were subsequently found to be at increased risk of experiencing premature pacemaker failure. Survival curves for patients and pacemakers were constructed by the Kaplan-Meier method with appropriate censoring at the time of unrelated death or elective explantation of a normal device. To examine the effect of unreported loss of follow-up data, patient mortality was then ignored, and follow-up for pacemakers without known failure was assumed to continue to the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>analysis.</b> Results. There were 13 device failures, with a median pacemaker survival time of 37 months. Twenty-three patients died, all of causes unrelated to the pacemaker system; median patient survival time was only 44 months. Ignoring this attrition inflated follow-up time from 122 to 188 patient-years and reduced the apparent pacemaker failures at 30 months by almost half, from 37 % to only 20 %. Modeling the process shows that when the patient mortality rate is more than half the pacemaker failure rate, ignoring censoring inflates the device survival estimate by ≥ 10 % from the median survival onward. Conclusions. When medical device survival curves are generated by implant registration data and returned product analysis, they should be adjusted for unreported loss of follow-up...|$|E
