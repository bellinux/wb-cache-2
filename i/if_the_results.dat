5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} design of fault-tolerant computer systems, particularly via lockstep systems performing the same operation in parallel. This provides redundancy in case one component should fail, and also allows automatic error detection and error correction <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> differ. These methods can be used to help prevent single event upsets caused by transient errors. Although additional measures may be required in embedded or specialized systems, this method can provide a cost effective approach to achieve n-modular redundancy in commercial off-the-shelf systems.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} {{influenza}} viruses affect people, called Type A, Type B, and Type C. Usually, {{the virus is}} spread through the air from coughs or sneezes. This is believed to occur mostly over relatively short distances. It can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the mouth or eyes. A person may be infectious to others both {{before and during the}} time they are showing symptoms. The infection may be confirmed by testing the throat, sputum, or nose for the virus. A number of rapid tests are available; however, people may still have the infection <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> are negative. A type of polymerase chain reaction that detects the virus's RNA is more accurate.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{conditional}} <b>IF</b> statement {{can receive}} {{up to three}} line numbers as parameters (Arithmetic <b>IF).</b> <b>The</b> program branches to <b>the</b> first linenumber <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of <b>the</b> expression in parentheses is less than zero, to <b>the</b> second <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> is zero and to <b>the</b> third <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> is above zero.|$|R

5|$|On the {{political}} level, Duhalde's presidency was {{strongly influenced by}} his feud with Menem. Menem wanted to run for a new term as president in the 2003 election, and Duhalde wanted to prevent it. To this purpose, he sought other candidates that may have defeated him. Some of these potential candidates were Carlos Reutemann, José Manuel de la Sota, Mauricio Macri, Adolfo Rodríguez Saá, Felipe Solá and Roberto Lavagna, but none of those negotiations bore fruit. The scandal {{over the death of}} the piqueteros Maximiliano Kosteki and Manuel Santillán in the Avellaneda massacre forced Duhalde to rush the elections by six months. As a result, he chose Néstor Kirchner, governor of Santa Cruz Province, despite his reservations. Kirchner was fifth in the presidential polls, and was mostly unknown by the public. Duhalde speculated that, although Menem had a large number of willing voters to begin with, he was also very unpopular. Thus, Menem might have won the elections but <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> called for a ballotage, most of the population would rally under any candidate with a chance to defeat him.|$|E

25|$|The {{alternative}} rounding modes {{are also}} useful in diagnosing numerical instability: <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of a subroutine vary substantially between rounding to + and − infinity {{then it is}} likely numerically unstable and affected by round-off error.|$|E
50|$|Summarizing, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of {{a binary}} {{addition}} contains a non-decimal low digit or causes the half-carry flag to be set, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> must be corrected by adding 06 to it; <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> contains a non-decimal high digit, <b>the</b> <b>result</b> must be further corrected by adding 60 {{to produce the}} correct final BCD value.|$|R

25|$|There is a {{high-temperature}} materials lab at ORNL {{that permits}} researchers from universities, private companies {{and other government}} initiatives to use their facilities.

A separate lab, the Shared Equipment User Facility, {{is one of three}} DOE sponsored facilities with nano-scale microscopy and tomography facilities.|$|E
25|$|Most, {{but not all}} {{individual}} studies {{support the}} superiority of the lipase. In one large study, there were no patients with pancreatitis who had an elevated amylase with a normal lipase. Another study found that the amylase could add diagnostic value to the lipase, but only <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of the two tests were combined with a discriminant function equation.|$|E
25|$|Piaget {{recognized}} that psychometric tests had its limitations, as {{children were not}} able to provide the researcher with their deepest thoughts and inner intellect. It was also difficult to know <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of child examination reflected what children believed or if it is just a pretend situation. For example, {{it is very difficult to}} know with certainty if a child who has a conversation with a toy believes the toy is alive or if the child is just pretending.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{assume a}} machine where a set parity flag {{indicates}} even parity. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of <b>the</b> last operation were 26 (11010 in binary), the parity flag would be 0 since {{the number of}} set bits is odd.

25|$|Diehl {{worked with}} Castle {{behind the scenes}} to move {{legislation}} forward despite the Treasury's opposition to the program. However, the Treasury suggested to Castle that the department should conduct a study to determine the feasibility of the program. With Diehl's advice, Castle accepted the Treasury's offer, and the agreement was codified in the United States Commemorative Coin Act of 1996. The act also authorized the secretary to proceed with the 50 States Quarters program without further congressional action <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of the feasibility study were favorable.|$|E
25|$|A {{gene probe}} for rpoB is {{available}} in some countries and this serves as a useful marker for MDR-TB, because isolated RMP resistance is rare (except when patients {{have a history of}} being treated with rifampicin alone). <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of a gene probe (rpoB) are known to be positive, then it is reasonable to omit RMP and to use SHEZ+MXF+cycloserine. The reason for maintaining the patient on INH despite the suspicion of MDR-TB is that INH is so potent in treating TB that it is foolish to omit it until there is microbiological proof that it is ineffective.|$|E
25|$|In humans, {{there is}} a {{seasonal}} variation in aggression associated with changes in testosterone. For example, in some primate species, such as rhesus monkeys and baboons, females {{are more likely to}} engage in fights around the time of ovulation as well as right before menstruation. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> were the same in humans as they are in rhesus monkeys and baboons, then the increase in aggressive behaviors during ovulation is explained by the decline in estrogen levels. This makes normal testosterone levels more effective. Castrated mice and rats exhibit lower levels of aggression. Males castrated as neonates exhibit low levels of aggression even when given testosterone throughout their development.|$|E

25|$|Feeney {{first came}} to {{national}} prominence in 2000, shortly after his election as Speaker, when he led efforts to certify the state's Republican presidential electors {{even though it was}} still unclear whether George W. Bush or Al Gore had won the state's electoral votes. Feeney and his colleagues claimed that Florida's electoral votes were in imminent danger of being removed from consideration <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of the popular vote in the state could not be determined with legal certainty. While Article 2 of the United States Constitution places this power in the legislature, many Democrats insisted that recounts needed to be completed, and that by doing so, a clear legal victor would emerge.|$|E
25|$|Consider an {{experiment}} {{that can produce}} a number of outcomes. The set of all outcomes is called the sample space of the experiment. The power set of the sample space (or equivalently, the event space) is formed by considering all different collections of possible results. For example, rolling an honest die produces one of six possible results. One collection of possible results corresponds to getting an odd number. Thus, the subset {1,3,5} {{is an element of}} the power set of the sample space of die rolls. These collections are called events. In this case, {1,3,5} is the event that the die falls on some odd number. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> that actually occur fall in a given event, that event is said to have occurred.|$|E
25|$|Gerry Canavan {{argues that}} Wild Seed {{challenges}} conventional fantasies of race by having Doro’s eugenics project supersede that of Europe’s by millennia. In this “alternate history,” “America itself--now {{transformed into a}} blip between the secret history of Doro's experiments and the brutal aftermath of their horrible success--becomes retold here as an African story, in an Africanist recentering of history {{that serves as a}} strongly anti-colonialist provocation, even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> are mostly anti-utopian.” Still, while Doro’s eugenic project turns out a “superpowered blackness” that negates notions of white supremacy, his exploitation of his people as mere genetic experiments echoes the breeding methods of New World slave owners, thus replicating the actual history of racial slavery practiced by the Western world.|$|E
