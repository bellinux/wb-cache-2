During peak hours (weekdays from opening until 9:30a.m. and 3â€“7p.m.), <b>fares</b> (effective 2014) range from $2.25 to $6.00, depending on distance traveled. At all other times, <b>fares</b> range from $2.00 to $3.85 based on distance traveled. Discounted <b>fares</b> are available for school children, the disabled, and the elderly.

5|$|<b>Fares</b> on Swift are {{equivalent}} to Community Transit's local service <b>fares,</b> {{divided into three}} groups: adult at $2.25, youth at $1.50, and reduced at $1.00. Adult fare is charged for passengers {{between the ages of}} 19 and 64, youth fare is charged for passengers between the ages of 6 and 18, and the reduced fare is charged for passengers over the age of 65, or those with disabilities or Medicare card holders. At the time of Swift's launch in 2009, adult <b>fares</b> were set at $1.50; since then, <b>fares</b> have since increased to the present $2.25 for adults effective July 1, 2015.|$|E

5000|$|Potential for {{a higher}} <b>fare</b> charge if a user forgets to touch off: the final cost of a trip, after which the user has not touched off (deliberately or accidentally), may be higher than the best <b>fare.</b> For {{regional}} town buses the default <b>fare</b> may {{be as much as}} a two-zone <b>fare.</b> The default <b>fare</b> for Melbourne Metropolitan Train trips is a '2 Hour Zone 1+2' <b>fare,</b> unless touching on a tram which results in a '2 Hour Zone 1' <b>fare.</b>|$|R

5|$|Although {{operated}} by private companies, the system's fare structure is {{regulated by the}} Public Transport Council (PTC), to which the operators submit requests for changes in <b>fares.</b> <b>Fares</b> are kept affordable by pegging them approximately to distance-related bus <b>fares,</b> thus encouraging commuters to use the network and reduce heavy reliance on the bus system. Fare increases {{over the past few}} years have caused public concern, the latest one having taken effect from 1 October 2008. There were similar expressions of disapproval over the slightly higher <b>fares</b> charged on SBS Transit's North East Line, a disparity that SBS Transit justified by citing higher costs of operation and maintenance on a completely underground line, as well as lower patronage.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the rail}} {{operators}} are government-assisted, profit-based corporations, <b>fares</b> on the MRT system are pitched {{to at least}} break-even level. The operators collect these <b>fares</b> by selling electronic data-storing tickets, the prices of which are calculated based on {{the distance between the}} start and destination stations. These prices increase in fixed stages for standard non-discounted travel. <b>Fares</b> are calculated in increments based on approximate distances between stations, in contrast to the use of fare zones in other subway systems, such as the London Underground.|$|E

Major findings include: (1) a wide variation in the <b>fare</b> collection systems and equipment, caused primarily by historical precedence; (2) the reliability of AFC equipment used at BART and WMATA discouraged other properties from considering use of similar equipment; (3) existing equipment may not meet the <b>fare</b> collection needs of properties in the near future; (4) the cost of <b>fare</b> collection operation and maintenance is high; and (5) the relatively small market in <b>fare</b> collection equipment discourages new product development by suppliers. Recommendations for <b>fare</b> collection R&D programs include development of new hardware to meet rail transit needs, study of impacts of alternate <b>fare</b> policies increased communication among policymakers, and consensus on <b>fare</b> policy issues...|$|R

5|$|In {{its last}} two years of operation, wartime rises in costs made the fixed fare {{structure}} untenable, and between July 1939 and January 1941 there were five slight adjustments to the <b>fares.</b> The live passenger rates rose to 7s5d in first class and 2s6d in third class, with equivalent changes to the <b>fares</b> for coffins. These <b>fares</b> remained far cheaper than the equivalent <b>fares</b> from Waterloo to Brookwood for both living and dead passengers on the Southern Railway (SR), which had absorbed the LSWR in the 1923 restructuring of Britain's railways. The fare structure of January 1941 remained in use following the April 1941 suspension of London Necropolis Railway services, for the occasional funerals conducted by the LNC using the SR's platforms at Waterloo station, but the SR only allowed mourners attending funerals to use these cheap <b>fares</b> and not those visiting the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The Greater London Labour Manifesto for the 1981 elections, {{although}} written under McIntosh's leadership, {{had been}} {{determined by a}} special conference of the London Labour Party in October 1980 in which Livingstone's speech had been decisive on transport policy. The manifesto focused on job creation schemes and cutting London Transport <b>fares,</b> and it was to these issues that Livingstone's administration turned. One primary manifesto focus had been a pledge known as <b>Fares</b> Fair, which focused on reducing London Underground <b>fares</b> and freezing them at that lower rate. Based on a fare freeze implemented by the South Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council in 1975, it was widely {{considered to be a}} moderate and mainstream policy by Labour, which it was hoped would get more Londoners using public transport, thereby reducing congestion. In October 1981, the GLC implemented their policy, cutting London Transport <b>fares</b> by 32%; to fund the move, the GLC planned to increase the London rates.|$|E
5|$|The LNC {{continued}} to lobby the SR and its 1948 successor British Railways until the 1950s {{on the matter}} of cheap <b>fares</b> for visitors to the cemetery, but were unable to come to any agreement. In 1957 the Southern Region of British Railways considered allowing the LNC to sell discounted <b>fares</b> of 7s6d (compared to the standard rate of 9s4d) for day return tickets from London to Brookwood. By this time most visitors to the cemetery were travelling by road. The LNC felt that the relatively minor difference between the <b>fares</b> would not be sufficient to attract visitors back to the railway, and the proposal was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|<b>Fares</b> for Metro {{light rail}} service {{are the same}} as those for most Metro Transit bus {{services}} and include unlimited transfers to other light rail and bus routes within 2.5 hours from the time a fare is paid. Two exceptions exist for Metro light rail services: <b>fares</b> within (but not between) downtown zones are less expensive than regular <b>fares</b> but may not be transferred; and there is no cost to ride between terminals 1 and 2 at the Minneapolisâ€“Saint Paul International Airport (MSP). Many stations connect with rail or bus routes. The Target Field station provides a connection to the Northstar commuter rail line, while the Mall of America station allows for transfers to the Metro Red Line bus rapid transit service. The A Line bus rapid transit line connects with the 46th Street Blue Line station and the Snelling Avenue Green Line stop. Two Metro light rail stations â€“ 28th Avenue and Fort Snelling â€“ have designated park and ride lots.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fares</b> on Community Transit buses {{are priced}} into three groups: adult, youth, and reduced.

Up to two children under 5 ride free with a chaperone paying full or reduced fare for themselves. <b>Fares</b> also change based on service level, with local service within Snohomish County costing the least and commuter service to Seattle being more expensive; commuter service from southern Snohomish County and Everett is also less costly compared to commuter service from northern and eastern Snohomish County.

50|$|The <b>Fare</b> Adjustment Mechanism is {{a system}} {{regulating}} the <b>fare</b> increment of public utilities, including the Mass Transit Railway Corporation Limited (MTR). Under the Mechanism, adjustment of MTR <b>fare</b> {{no longer need to}} be approved by the Legislative Council nor the Executive Council. The MTR has no autonomy in its <b>fare</b> setting, and the <b>fare</b> has to be set in accordance with a fixed formula. Originally, the Mechanism aims to limit the soaring MTR <b>fare</b> increment by a transparent formulaic approach. However, Hong Kong has recorded continuous inflation in recent years, the MTR <b>fare</b> has then kept rising since 2010. Such phenomenon was greatly criticised by the general public.|$|R
