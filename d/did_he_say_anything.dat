6000|$|... 'To the Chevalier,' {{said the}} Colonel; 'it {{is a good}} {{travelling}} name, and which we may both freely use. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> more?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, yes, I dare say! We {{all know}} that. He means {{to give you}} some present worth having, I hope. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> that looked like it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Things of {{that kind}} make an {{impression}} on a new-comer," [...] Sylvia languidly remarked. [...] "One gets used to them after a while. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> else?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I see! That {{come after}} dinner, when our Navigator threw 'is cap down an' danced on it. Danby was quartermaster. They 'ad a tea-party on the bridge. It {{was the old}} man's contribution. <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about the leadsmen?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{see that}} it is a job at all," [...] said Mrs. Trevelyan. [...] "Somebody is wanted, and nobody can know more of the service than papa does. But as the other man is a lord, I suppose papa must give way. <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about mamma, Nora?" ...|$|R
5|$|Epaminondas was {{considered}} the greatest warrior-statesmen of ancient Thebes by many, including the Roman historian Diodorus Siculus. Diodorus does not have <b>anything</b> to <b>say</b> about the sexual orientation of Epaminondas or the Sacred Band, nor <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about the following account, again from Plutarch (Amatorius 17). According to Plutarch's dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had two male lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus, the latter died with him at Mantineia in battle. They were buried together, something usually reserved for {{a husband and wife}} in Greek society.|$|R
6000|$|A little ashamed, {{she blushed}} instead of speaking, {{and waited for}} Richard {{to come up and}} begin. Neither <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> and they paused till, the silence {{disturbing}} her, she ventured a [...] "Well, papa!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You poor dear," [...] said Edith sympathetically, {{beginning}} {{a search for}} the cologne. [...] "Lie down on the bed and I'll bathe your poor head. Did you have a good time at Harbour Hill? And how did you leave Sid? <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about coming up?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not talking}} about my hating him, or loving him. If he's honest to you, I'll neither say nor do {{anything}} to cross him. But if he does mane to marry you, it's time he did it; that's all. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to father about it?" ...|$|E
60|$|Mavering {{thought of}} blueberries, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not <b>say</b> <b>anything.</b>|$|R
60|$|Alec looked down, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not <b>say</b> <b>anything.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not move.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not <b>say</b> <b>anything.</b> She was quivering with indignation and with contempt.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am terrified," [...] she said. [...] "Monsieur {{must come}} to my apartments one afternoon, where we can talk without fear. There is one more question, though," [...] she {{continued}} rapidly. [...] "Louis looked often at us. Tell me, <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to you about Monsieur Bartot and myself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is {{just what}} she is, a pretty, nay, a {{beautiful}} soul, full of tenderness and forgiveness and affection and humility, only I doubt whether there is any force or resolution to hold her own. You smile! Well, perhaps the less of that she has the better she may get on with him. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about her?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He had a {{favourite}} sister,' said my aunt, 'a good creature, {{and very}} kind to him. But she did what they all do--took a husband. And HE did what they all do--made her wretched. It had such an effect upon the mind of Mr. Dick (that's not madness, I hope!) that, combined with his fear of his brother, and his sense of his unkindness, it threw him into a fever. That was before he came to me, but the recollection of it is oppressive to him even now. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to you about King Charles the First, child?' ...|$|E
60|$|Again <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not <b>say</b> <b>anything.</b> <b>He</b> only frowned. And it was {{an angry}} frown. I waited. Nothing more came.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right," [...] Stella agreed. [...] "Don't run any risks. We shall {{come across}} one another now and then, {{especially}} since my father seems determined to throw open his doors {{once more to}} the usual mob. By the by, <b>does</b> <b>he</b> ever <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about me?" ...|$|R
60|$|When {{this set}} in the Snow-man set off. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not complain, and those are bad signs.|$|R
60|$|In {{half a day}} I got the two topmasts {{aboard and}} the shears rigged and guyed as before. And that night I slept on board and on deck beside my work. Maud, who refused to stay alone ashore, slept in the forecastle. Wolf Larsen had sat about, {{listening}} to my repairing the windlass and talking with Maud and me upon indifferent subjects. No reference was made on either side {{to the destruction of}} the shears; nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> further about my leaving his ship alone. But still I had feared him, blind and helpless and listening, always listening, and I never let his strong arms get within reach of me while I worked.|$|E
60|$|The {{dinner was}} very pleasant, {{but the judge}} talked for the whole party. Madeline hardly spoke at all, nor did Lady Staveley say much. Felix managed {{to put in a}} few words occasionally, as it always becomes a good {{listener}} to do, but the brunt of the battle lay with the host. One thing Felix observed painfully,--that not a word was spoken about Lady Mason or Orley Farm. When he had been last there the judge had spoken of it openly before the whole party, expressing his opinion that she was a woman much injured; but now neither <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> nor did Lady Staveley. He would probably not have observed this had not a feeling crept upon him during the last fortnight, that that thorough conviction which men had felt as to her innocence was giving way. While the ladies were there, however, he did not himself allude to the subject.|$|E
6000|$|Our bore {{is great}} in secret information. He happens to know {{many things that}} nobody else knows. He can {{generally}} tell you where the split is in the Ministry; he knows {{a great deal about}} the Queen; and has little anecdotes to relate of the royal nursery. He gives you the judge's private opinion of Sludge the murderer, and his thoughts when he tried him. He happens to know what such a man got by such a transaction, and it was fifteen thousand five hundred pounds, and his income is twelve thousand a year. Our bore is also great in mystery. He believes, with an exasperating appearance of profound meaning, that you saw Parkins last Sunday? - Yes, you did. - <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> particular? - No, nothing particular. - Our bore is surprised at that. - Why? - Nothing. Only he understood that Parkins had come to tell you something. - What about? - Well! our bore is not at liberty to mention what about. But, he believes you will hear that from Parkins himself, soon, and he hopes it may not surprise you as it did him. Perhaps, however, you never heard about Parkins's wife's sister? - No. - Ah! says our bore, that explains it! ...|$|E
5000|$|Fired: Martin Moloney - Caroline {{felt that}} Martin {{did not want}} it bad enough. Martin also oversaw the {{spelling}} mistake and <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not <b>say</b> <b>anything.</b>|$|R
60|$|Dr. Mulbridge {{instantly}} sobered, {{and even}} turned a little pale, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not <b>say</b> <b>anything.</b> <b>He</b> remained {{looking at her}} as if she had suddenly changed from a piquant mystery to a terrible dilemma.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, {{there is}} Mr. Singleton, father,' Dorothy exclaimed in surprise, as her eye fell upon {{him as she}} went down the gangway. 'Why, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about coming over when we said good-bye to him last night.' ...|$|R
60|$|Nobble was {{not very}} nice. Over and beside his {{professional}} success, {{there was not much}} in his present life which endeared itself to John Caldigate. But the acquisition of gold is a difficult thing to leave. There is a curse about it, or a blessing,--it is hard to decide which,--that makes it almost impossible for a man to tear himself away from its pursuit when it is coming in freely. And the absolute gold,--not the money, not the balance at one's banker's, not the plentiful so much per annum,--but the absolute metal clinging about the palm of one's hands like small gravel, or welded together in a lump too heavy to be lifted, has a peculiar charm of its own. I have heard of a man who, having his pocket full of diamonds, declared, as he let them run through his fingers, that human bliss could not go beyond that sensation. John Caldigate did not shoe his horse with gold; but he liked to feel that he had enough gold by him to shoe a whole team. He could not return home quite as yet. His affairs were too complicated to be left quite at a moment's notice. If, as he hoped, he should find himself able to leave the colony within four years of the day on which he had begun work, and could then do so with an adequate fortune, he believed that he should have done better than any other Englishman who had set himself to the task of gold-finding. In none of his letters <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> special about Hester Bolton; but his inquiries about the family generally were so frequent as to make his father wonder why such questions should be asked. The squire himself, who was living hardly a dozen miles from Mr. Bolton's house, did not see the old banker above once a quarter perhaps and the ladies of the family certainly not oftener than once a year. Very little was said in answer to any of John's inquiries. 'Mr. and Mrs. and Miss Bolton are, I believe, quite well.' So much was declared in one of the old squire's letters; and even that little served to make known that at any rate, so far, no tidings as to marriage on the part of Hester had reached the ear of her father's old friend. Perhaps this was all that John Caldigate wanted to learn.|$|E
50|$|During the disembarkation, Shafter sent forward Fifth Corps' Cavalry Division under Joseph Wheeler to reconnoiter {{the road}} to Santiago de Cuba. In a {{complete}} disregard of orders, Wheeler brought on a fight which escalated into the Battle of Las Guasimas. Shafter apparently did not realize the battle was even underway nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to Wheeler about it afterward.|$|E
50|$|Zabulon/Zavulon - A Grand Dark Mage {{and head}} of the Moscow Day Watch. His age matches Gesar's. During the events of the New Watch, when Anton was {{experiencing}} the thoughts of Erasmus Darwin, it was discovered that Zavulon was Erasmus' teacher, and that he had educated him well, not only in magic usage of the Others, but a historical and philosophical one. It's also discovered, once the goblet that contained the prophecy was broken, that Zavulon didn't give up on Erasmus when the Tiger gave chase, but tried to fight him, and, once that was proven to be futile, pleaded for mercy. The Tiger departed since Erasmus had yelled out the prophecy into an oak tree. Zavulon's Twilight form is known to be a hairy, demonic humanoid, larger than usual. He had known of the Tiger during the first encounter with him, but he did not share the information with Anton. It's possible that Gesar knew who they were dealing with but neither <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> about it. Zavulon sees the Tiger as a giant, gross demon.|$|E
5000|$|By pure coincidence, {{they once}} vacationed in Guam {{at the same}} time. When Matsumoto saw Hamada, he avoided him. When later asked by Hamada why <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> <b>he</b> replied {{that it would have}} been [...] "too awkward".|$|R
60|$|As I did {{not care}} to connect my future with fire, this idea did not strike me very forcibly, but it struck Phineas Colwell. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to me, but after I had gone {{he went to the}} well-drivers.|$|R
6000|$|Dave had {{his doubts}} about doing any [...] "bronco-busting" [...] {{on his own}} account, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to Roger and Phil about it. He was not afraid, but he knew Jessie would be greatly worried if he {{attempted}} anything dangerous.|$|R
60|$|Wesley laughed good-humouredly, {{as if at}} a child. His {{heart was}} {{suddenly}} set on going west, and {{he was sure he}} could soon bring Theodosia around. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> more about it just then. Wesley thought he knew how to manage women.|$|R
6000|$|... "What shall I {{say to him}} if <b>he</b> <b>does</b> ask me that question? He {{has called}} me by my name two or three times, and spoken to me as though {{he wanted me to}} like him. If <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to me like that, what shall I answer?" ...|$|R
60|$|When Adam {{got home}} after his walk, he found Sir Nathaniel {{just going to}} bed. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> to him then of what had happened, but {{contented}} himself with arranging that they would walk together in the early morning, as he had much to say that would require serious attention.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If father didn't mean anything,' blubbered {{the injured}} Grinder, 'why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> go and <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> mother? Nobody thinks half so bad {{of me as}} my own father does. What a unnatural thing! I wish somebody'd take and chop my head off. Father wouldn't mind doing it, I believe, and I'd much rather <b>he</b> <b>did</b> that than t'other.' ...|$|R
60|$|One of {{the clerks}} looked up. He {{was thin and}} tall, with a small face. His way of looking was alert. Then he glanced round {{to the other end}} of the room, where was a glass office. And then he came forward. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> but leaned in a gentle, inquiring fashion towards Mrs. Morel.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not <b>say</b> <b>anything,</b> but {{picked up his}} sticks. Then, however, having first made sure that the dog was being held by the Kafirs, he turned, his face {{streaming}} with blood, his one eye blazing with fury, and, shaking both his clenched fists at poor Bessie, broke into a scream of cursing.|$|R
