40|$|The {{control of}} input-to-output mappings, or <b>gain</b> <b>control,</b> {{is one of}} the main {{strategies}} used by neural networks for the processing and gating of information. Using a spiking neural network model, we studied the <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> induced by a form of inhibitory feedforward circuitry — also known as ’open-loop feedback’ —, which has been experimentally observed in a cerebellum-like structure in weakly electric fish. We found, both analytically and numerically, that this network displays three different regimes of gain control: subtractive, divisive, and non-monotonic. Subtractive <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> was obtained when noise is very low in the network. Also, it was possible to change from divisive to non-monotonic <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> by simply modulating the strength of the feedforward inhibition, which may be achieved via long-term synaptic plasticity. The particular case of divisive <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> has been previously observed in vivo in weakly electric fish. These <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> regimes were robust to the presence of temporal delays in the inhibitory feedforward pathway, which were found to linearize the input-to-output mappings (or f-I curves) via a novel variability-increasing mechanism. Our findings highlight the feedforward-induced <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> analyzed here as a highly versatile mechanism of information gating in the brain...|$|R

The original capital was in the principality of Anegondi on the northern banks of the Tungabhadra River in today's Karnataka.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Psychology, Washington State UniversityThe motion aftereffect (MAE) is {{a visual}} {{illusion}} {{that occurs when}} an individual observes a moving (adapting) pattern {{for a period of}} time followed immediately by the viewing of a physically stationary (test) pattern which appears to move in the opposite direction. A variation of the MAE, called storage, temporally separates the adapting pattern and test pattern with an unrelated visual stimulus, leaving a residual MAE. The dominant explanation is <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> theory (van De Grind, Lankheet, & Tao, 2003; van De Grind, van Der Smagt, & Verstraten, 2004; Verstraten, Fredericksen, Grüsser, & van De Grind, 1994), which posits that the residual MAE is the result of <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms normalizing the motion sensing cells in the visual system. One method for testing this <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> explanation of the MAE is to employ a diverted-attention manipulation during adaptation, which results in a reduced MAE duration and is generally described as interacting with the <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms. This project employed diverted-attention manipulations during MAE storage to test the <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> explanation of MAE storage. The results supported the <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> explanation of the MAE as it pertains to motion adaptation but failed to support the <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> explanation of MAE storage as it exists in the literature. A modification of the <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> explanation of MAE storage that invokes the concept of interference can explain our results.

40|$|The {{achievable}} rate {{of digital}} communications systems can strongly {{depend on the}} analog-to-digital conversion at the receiver. It is hence important to adjust the <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> at the receiver {{in such a way}} that the performance degradation due to the analog-to-digital conversion is as small as possible. This paper studies the concept of an optimal <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> to maximize the achievable rate of single-carrier systems that employ analog-to-digital conversion with uniform quantization. Transmission of complex-valued symbols is considered, and a phase offset between transmitter and receiver is taken into account. The optimal <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> derives from the average mutual information between the transmitted symbols and quantized received samples. Allowing for a small tolerance of the achievable rate, it is possible to adequately adjust the <b>gain</b> <b>control</b> even with limited accuracy.

In the early 1050s Earl Siward turned against the Scottish ruler Mac Bethad mac Findlaích ("Macbeth"). Despite the death of his son Osbjorn, Siward defeated Mac Bethad in battle in 1054. More than half a millennium later the Scotland adventure earned him a place in William Shakespeare's Macbeth.
