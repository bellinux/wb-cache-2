5|$|Upon {{the sudden}} {{popularity}} of the Terrible Towel, Pittsburgh-area department stores sold out all gold and black <b>hand</b> <b>towels.</b> Because the <b>hand</b> <b>towels</b> were often sold as a set, with matching bath towels, stores were left with un-even sets. In the fall of 1978, Bernard Pollock, divisional marketing manager of Gimbel's Department Store {{came up with the}} idea of putting a Terrible <b>Towel</b> logo on <b>hand</b> <b>towels</b> and sold the idea to Cope. The first Terrible Towels hit the marketplace on December 20, 1978 at $6 apiece. Gimbel's could not stock them fast enough. Gimbel's has since gone out of business. The original version of The Terrible Towel was manufactured by Fieldcrest and distributed by St. Mary's Inc. of New York and was available in two colors: Gold and Black. The current manufacturer of the Towel is Little Earth Productions, Inc. of Pittsburgh, who took over from McArthur Towel & Sports Co. of Baraboo, Wisconsin in 2013.

50|$|Preventative action {{revolves}} around personal hygiene and the cleanliness {{of the living}} quarters.

Under ideal conditions, bed covers, sleeping garments, and <b>hand</b> <b>towels</b> should be changed daily. Simple laundering of clothes and linen disinfects them. Children should wear gloves while asleep, and the bedroom floor should be kept clean. Food should be covered to limit contamination with dust-borne parasite eggs. Household detergents have {{little effect on the}} viability of pinworm eggs, and cleaning the bathroom with a damp cloth moistened with an antibacterial agent or bleach will merely spread the still-viable eggs. Similarly, shaking clothes and bed linen will detach and spread the eggs.|$|R

When Jake finds Collier, he departs the building, causing Bernardo to chase after him, but causing the police to follow them.|$|R
