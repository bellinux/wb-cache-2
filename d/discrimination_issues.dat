25|$|The {{benefits}} of the referendum began to flow to Aboriginal people in 1972. On 26 January 1972, Aboriginal peoples erected the Aboriginal Tent Embassy on the lawns of the Federal Parliament building in Canberra to express their frustration {{at the lack of}} progress on land rights and racial <b>discrimination</b> <b>issues.</b> This became a major confrontation that raised Aboriginal affairs high on the political agenda in the federal election later that year. One week after gaining office, the Whitlam Government (1972–1975) established a Royal Commission into land rights for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory under Justice Woodward. Its principal recommendations, delivered in May 1974, were: that Aboriginal people should have inalienable title to reserve lands; that regional Land Councils should be established; to establish a fund to purchase land with which Aboriginal people had a traditional connection, or that would provide economic or other benefits; prospecting and mineral exploration on Aboriginal land should only occur with their consent or that of the Federal Government if the national interest required it; entry onto Aboriginal land should require a permit issued by the regional Land Council. The recommendations were framed in terms to enable application outside the Northern Territory. The Federal Government agreed to implement the principal recommendations and in 1975 the House of Representatives passed the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill and the Aboriginal Land (Northern Territory) Bill but the Senate had not considered them by the time parliament was dissolved in 1975.|$|E

It was feared that the male members of the crew would argue and fight over the women.

30|$|The core {{objective}} for {{the remote}} sensing target localization and tracking is to generate target state estimates using measurements processed by the sensors, {{such as the}} radar [1 – 3]. The measurements can originate from targets or from clutter and lead to both true tracks (following the targets) and false tracks (following the clutter) existing in the surveillance area. Therefore, false track discrimination [4], involving true track confirmation and false track termination, is crucial for tracking algorithms. The probability of target existence (PTE) was first introduced in [4] as a soft decision {{of the existence of}} a target, which can be used to alleviate the false track <b>discrimination</b> <b>issue.</b>|$|R
