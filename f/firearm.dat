5000|$|Differentiation between Unrestricted and Restricted <b>Firearms</b> {{categories}} {{is done in}} the <b>Firearms</b> (Restricted <b>Firearms</b> and Ammunition) Order 2008 [...] and the <b>Firearms</b> (Restricted <b>Firearms</b> and Ammunition) (Amendment) Order 2009. The {{differentiation between}} Unrestricted and Restricted <b>firearms</b> was done by creating a list of unrestricted <b>firearms</b> and deeming all other <b>firearms</b> to be restricted. This has led to some legislative oversights of note; for example, crossbows are legally restricted <b>firearms</b> in Ireland because {{at the time of the}} drafting of these Orders, nobody remembered to add them to the list of unrestricted <b>firearms</b> (crossbows were added to the category of <b>firearms</b> in Irish law with the 1990 <b>firearms</b> act, other forms of bow are not legally <b>firearms</b> in Ireland). Also, the majority of paintball markers are legally classified as Short Restricted <b>Firearms</b> in Ireland and as such cannot be legally licensed following the 2009 <b>firearms</b> act (and strictly speaking, significant jail sentences and fines could result from a prosecution).|$|R

5000|$|Gun {{legislation}} in Canada is largely about licensing and registration. Handgun registration became law in 1934, and automatic <b>firearms</b> registration was added in 1951. In 1969, laws classified <b>firearms</b> as [...] "non-restricted", [...] "restricted" [...] and [...] "prohibited". Starting in 1979, individuals {{who wished to}} acquire <b>firearms</b> were required to obtain a <b>firearms</b> acquisition certificate ('FAC') from their local police agency. From 1995-2012, all <b>firearms</b> owners were required to possess a <b>firearms</b> licence (either a 'PAL', 'POL', 'FAC', or a 'minors licence') and all <b>firearms</b> were required to be registered. In April 2012, the requirement to register non-restricted <b>firearms</b> was dropped in every province and territory, except for Quebec; the requirement for all <b>firearms</b> owners to possess a valid <b>firearms</b> licence remains law. In 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled against Quebec, thus the non-restricted registry records were destroyed in their entirety.|$|R
