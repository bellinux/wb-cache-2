In this paper, we analyzed the non-linear differential equation to determine the geodesic curves on ruled surfaces which is obtained by a strictly connected spacelike straight 3 line moving with <b>Frenet’s</b> <b>frame</b> along a timelike curve in IR 1. When we assume that curvature and torsion of base curve and components with respect to <b>Frenet’s</b> <b>frame</b> of spacelike straight-line are constants, for special integration constants, we show that the resulting non-linear differential equation can be integrated exactly.

50|$|Given {{the image}} of a {{parametric}} curve, one can define several different parametrizations of the parametric curve. Differential geometry aims to describe the properties of parametric curves that are invariant under certain re-parametrizations. We thus have to define a suitable equivalence relation on the set of all parametric curves. The differential-geometric properties of a parametric curve (e.g., its length, its <b>Frenet</b> <b>frame</b> and its generalized curvature) are invariant under re-parametrization and therefore properties of the equivalence class itself. The equivalence classes are called -curves and are central objects studied in the differential geometry of curves.|$|E
