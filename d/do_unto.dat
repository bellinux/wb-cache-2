500|$|LaVey {{rejects the}} idea of prayer, instead urging Satanists {{to take action to}} fix a {{situation}} instead of asking for a solution. The seven deadly sins are advocated, on the basis that they all lead to personal pleasure. He says that Satanism is a form of [...] "controlled selfishness", in the sense that doing something to help another will in turn make one happy. The Golden Rule is again mentioned, and LaVey suggests altering it from [...] "Do unto others as you would have them <b>do</b> <b>unto</b> you" [...] to [...] "Do unto others as they <b>do</b> <b>unto</b> you" [...] so that if someone is treated poorly, he or she can respond viciously. The Book of Lucifer also contains a list of [...] "The Four Crown Princes of Hell" [...] (Satan, Lucifer, Belial, and Leviathan) and of seventy-seven [...] "Infernal Names", representations of Satan from various cultures and religions. They are the names that, according to LaVey, are most useful in Satanic rituals.|$|E

2500|$|In 1688, {{five years}} after its founding, Germantown became {{the birthplace of the}} anti-slavery {{movement}} in America. Pastorius, Gerret Hendericks, Derick Updegraeff and Abraham Updengraef gathered at Thones Kunders's house and wrote a two-page condemnation of slavery and sent it to the governing bodies of their Quaker church, the Society of Friends. The petition was mainly based upon the Bible's Golden Rule, [...] "Do unto others as you would have them <b>do</b> <b>unto</b> you." [...] Though the Quaker establishment took no immediate action, the 1688 Germantown Quaker Petition Against Slavery was a clear and forceful argument against slavery and initiated the process of banning slavery in the Society of Friends (1776) and Pennsylvania (1780).|$|E

Granholm responded that she did not think her response was controversial and said that many people of faith were serving in state government.|$|E
2500|$|Once a {{high school}} program was established, {{it became obvious that}} {{athletics}} would not only be important, but also would be a venue in which the school would be viewed by many others outside the school. A Christian philosophy of athletics was written to guide the athletic development of students and to reflect Christian values on the playing field and in the stands. CHA's philosophy of athletics is as follows: Since we are ambassadors for Jesus Christ, let us conduct ourselves in word and action just as Christ would conduct himself. Therefore, all that we do, we will do with a total release of our mental and physical abilities and our emotional energies towards our performance, having in mind that Christ is our only audience. Concerning our attitude towards players and fans of the opposing team, we will strive [...] "to love our neighbor as ourselves" [...] and [...] "do unto them as we would have them <b>do</b> <b>unto</b> us." ...|$|E
2500|$|All major {{religions}} accept {{organ donation}} {{in at least}} some form on either utilitarian grounds (i.e., because of its life-saving capabilities) or deontological grounds (e.g., the right of an individual believer to make his or her own decision). Most religions, among them the Roman Catholic Church, support organ donation {{on the grounds that it}} constitutes an act of charity and provides a means of saving a life, consequently Pope Francis is an organ donor. One religious group, The Jesus Christians, became known as [...] "The Kidney Cult" [...] because more than half its members had donated their kidneys altruistically. Jesus Christians claim altruistic kidney donation is a great way to [...] "Do unto others what they would want you to <b>do</b> <b>unto</b> them." [...] Some religions impose certain restrictions on the types of organs that may be donated and/or on the means by which organs may be harvested and/or transplanted. For example, Jehovah's Witnesses require that organs be drained of any blood due to their interpretation of the Hebrew Bible/Christian Old Testament as prohibiting blood transfusion, and Muslims require that the donor have provided written consent in advance. A few groups disfavor organ transplantation or donation; notably, these include Shinto and those who follow the customs of the Gypsies.|$|E
