Existing approaches aim at engineering good user experience to make applications more enjoyable and pleasurable. Especially in business applications, employees need to be motivated to perform their tasks, in order to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Negative user experience lowers user acceptance and decreases motivation. A study was conducted to identify factors that can cause negative user experience.

40|$|M. A. Dwarfism is {{a medical}} {{condition}} of disproportionate short stature and occurs in about one in every 25 000 children born worldwide (Scott, 1996). There are more than 200 types of dwarfism (Wikipedia, 2006), of which {{the most common form}} of dwarfism is Achondroplasia occurring in about 80 % of all dwarfs (Little People’s Research Fund, 2006). Dwarfism is plagued by negative stereotyping and stigmatisation. There is a paucity of existing research on dwarfism, and in particular it’s associated psychological aspects. Existing literature is largely focused on parents’ reactions towards their dwarf child but it is possible that the negative attention dwarfs receive when in public can directly affect a dwarf’s close relationships, in particular, those with their siblings. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore the experiences of non-dwarf siblings growing up with a dwarf sibling. A sibling relationship is an emotional bond or transaction existing between two brothers, two sisters or between a brother and a sister. This relationship can have both positive and <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> (Bank & Kahn, 1982) and these can be more profound with the presence of a sibling with a disability (Ferrari & Sussman, 1987). Previous studies of sibling relationships with a disability have <b>found</b> various <b>negative</b> <b>aspects,</b> for example, feelings of isolation, resentment, anger and guilt, as well as an increase of stress in the family (Carpenter, 1997). However, research also suggested positive aspects, including an acceptance of diversity and an appreciation for life and psychological growth (Connors & Stalker, 2003). Therefore, it was thought to be possible that these <b>negative</b> and positive <b>aspects</b> may also hold true for a sibling relationship in which one member is a dwarf...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{with early}} entry light sawing of Portland cement {{concrete}} (PCC) contraction joints began in Iowa in 1989. Since that time, changes in early sawing equipment have occurred {{as well as}} changes in specifications for sawing. The option to use early sawing for transverse contraction joints was specified in 1992. A problem happening occasionally with early sawing was the break out {{of some of the}} concrete around the end of the joint as the saw blade approached the edge of the slab. To prevent this, it was proposed that the sawing would terminate approximately 1 / 2 " to 3 / 4 " before the edge of the slab, creating a "short joint". This procedure would also leave a concrete "dam" to prevent the run-out and waste of the hot liquid joint sealant onto the shoulder. It would also eliminate the need for the labor and material for applying a duct tape dam at the open ends of each sawed joint to stop hot liquid sealant run-out Agreements were made with the contractor to apply the "short joint" technique for 1 day of paving. The evaluation and results are compared with an adjoining control section. The research <b>found</b> no <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> from sawing the "short joint". Three specific findings were noted. They are the following: 1) No joint end "blow-out" spalls of concrete occurred. 2) The need for the duct tape dam to stop liquid sealant overflow was eliminated. 3) Joint end corner spalls appear to be caused mainly by construction shouldering operations equipment. The "short joint" sawing technique can be routinely applied to early entry sawed transverse contraction joints with expectations of only positive results...|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis "bullying at apprentice training schoolsq {{is becoming more}} and more discussed these days. One of the main reasons of this trend is the constant media attention regarding the given topic. Cases of bullying and aggression are very often presented not only on television and in newspaper but also on the Internet. What is considered highly alarming is the fact that the age of aggressively behaving young people and children is continually dropping. I think that, as in the majority of interpersonal problems, the origin of this conduct is to be <b>found</b> in <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> of family upbringing. In my experience, most of the bullies grew up in families that were either incomplete or dysfunctional. The outcome of these findings is the content of the bachelor thesis here presented. In the theoretical part, I focus on the exact definition of bullying, aggressor and victim, on the specificities in children and youth, as well as on the definition of the family unit and its function. In the practical part, it was my goal to asses the extent of bullying at the Apprentice School in Třešť and to inquire into the connection between this kind of behavior and family upbringing. The research in the practical part was conducted through quantitative questionnaires for the students of the school and semi-standardized interviews with the teachers and staff. As an illustration, at the end of the practical part a case of one of the students at the Apprentice School in Třešť is presented. The research has revealed that the most important condition for a harmonic development of the child is an appropriate upbringing in his/her family without unnecessary punishments and without pathological symptoms in the functioning of the family...|$|R

This article presents the first systematic investigation of multidimensional perfectionism {{in the domain of}} sexuality exploring the unique relationships that different forms of sexual perfectionism show with positive and <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> of sexuality. A sample of 272 university students (52 male, 220 female) completed measures of four forms of sexual perfectionism: self-oriented, partner-oriented, partner-prescribed, and socially prescribed. In addition, they completed measures of sexual esteem, sexual self-efficacy, sexual optimism, sex life satisfaction (capturing positive aspects of sexuality) and sexual problem self-blame, sexual anxiety, sexual depression, and negative sexual perfectionism cognitions during sex (capturing <b>negative</b> <b>aspects).</b> Results showed unique patterns of relationships for the four forms of sexual perfectionism, suggesting that partner-prescribed and socially prescribed sexual perfectionism are maladaptive forms of sexual perfectionism associated with <b>negative</b> <b>aspects</b> of sexuality whereas self-oriented and partner-oriented sexual perfectionism emerged as ambivalent forms associated with positive and <b>negative</b> <b>aspects...</b>|$|R
