5|$|When {{the player}} {{encounters}} a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen where the Pokémon fight. During battle, the player may fight, use an item, switch the active Pokémon, or flee (the last {{is not an}} option in battles against trainers). Pokémon have hit points (HP), which is displayed during combat; when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and cannot battle unless taken to a Pokémon Center or healed or revived with a Pokémon skill or item. If the player's Pokémon defeats the opposing Pokémon (causes it to faint), it receives experience points. After accumulating enough experience points, it will level up; most Pokémon evolve into a new species of Pokémon when they reach a certain level, or when certain conditions are met (commonly, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> Pokémon statistically 'likes' its trainer).|$|E

25|$|Standard proverbs are {{essentially}} defined phrases, well-known to many people, as e. g. Don't bite {{the hand that}} feeds you. When this sequence slightly changed ("Don't bite the hand that looks dirty") it becomes an anti-proverb.

25|$|Cases, {{especially}} bottleneck cases, will stretch upon firing. <b>How</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> {{case will}} stretch depends upon load pressure, cartridge design, chamber size, functional cartridge headspace (usually {{the most important}} factor), and other variables. Periodically cases need to be trimmed {{to bring them back}} into proper specifications. Most reloading manuals list both a trim size and a max length. Long cases can create a safety hazard through improper headspace and possible increased pressure.|$|E

His financial legacy was severely limited under Greek law, which dictated <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> non-Greek surviving spouse could inherit. After two years of legal wrangling, Kennedy eventually accepted a settlement of $26million from Christina Onassis—Aristotle's daughter and sole heir— and waived all other claims to the Onassis estate.|$|E
25|$|Other {{researchers}} {{describe the}} nature connectedness construct in a simpler manner. For instance, nature connectedness {{can be thought}} of as a love of nature (also referred to as emotional affinity toward nature). Similarly, nature connectedness can be defined as <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> person believes they are the same as nature (more specifically, a person's connectivity with nature) or it {{can be thought of}} as simply feeling emotionally connected with nature. Nature connectedness (as a construct) is also known as nature relatedness, connectivity with nature, emotional affinity toward nature, or inclusion of nature in self.|$|E
25|$|Balancing robots {{generally}} use a gyroscope {{to detect}} <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> robot is falling and then drive the wheels proportionally {{in the same}} direction, to counterbalance the fall at hundreds of times per second, based on the dynamics of an inverted pendulum. Many different balancing robots have been designed. While the Segway is not commonly {{thought of as a}} robot, it {{can be thought of as}} a component of a robot, when used as such Segway refer to them as RMP (Robotic Mobility Platform). An example of this use has been as NASA's Robonaut that has been mounted on a Segway.|$|E

25|$|Gelfand is {{considered}} a pioneering researcher {{on the concept of}} tightness-looseness. She is credited with defining the tightness-looseness classification system, which assesses <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> culture adheres to social norms and tolerates deviance. Tight cultures are more restrictive, with stricter disciplinary measures for norm violations while loose cultures have weaker social norms and a higher tolerance for deviant behavior. Gelfand found that a history of threats, such as natural disasters, high population density, or vulnerability to infectious diseases, is associated with greater tightness. Her research has shown that tightness allows cultures to coordinate more effectively to survive threats.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{counting}} each day represents spiritual preparation and anticipation for the giving of the Torah which {{was given by}} God on Mount Sinai {{at the beginning of}} the month of Sivan, around the same time as the holiday of Shavuot. The Sefer HaChinuch (published anonymously in 13th century Spain) states that the Hebrew people were only freed from Egypt at Passover in order to receive the Torah at Sinai, an event which is now celebrated on Shavuot, and to fulfill its laws. Thus the Counting of the Omer demonstrates <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> Hebrew desires to accept the Torah in his own life.|$|E

As of April 1, 2009, The USBC now regulates the chemical surface roughness of all bowling balls manufactured for certified ten-pin bowling. This specification is a direct result from the ball motion study, as the surface roughness of the coverstock of a bowling ball was the number one variable (out of 18) that affected the strength (<b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> ball hooks) of a bowling ball. The radius of gyration specification has also been tightened and went into effect in 2010.

25|$|Globalization {{can benefit}} people with non-communicable {{diseases}} such as heart problems or mental health problems. Global trade and rules set forth by the World Trade Organization can actually benefit the health of people by making their incomes higher, allowing them to afford better health care. While {{it has to be}} admitted making many non-communicable diseases more likely as well. Also the national income of a country, mostly obtained by trading on the global market, is important because it dictates <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> government spends on health care for its citizens. It also has to be acknowledged that an expansion in the definition of disease often accompanies development, so the net effect is not clearly beneficial due to this and other effects of increased affluence. Metabolic syndrome is one obvious example. Although poorer countries have not yet experienced this and are still suffering from diseases listed above.|$|E
25|$|Medicare Part A {{provides}} {{payments for}} in-patient hospital, hospice, and skilled nursing services, excluding those {{of physicians and}} surgeons. Part B provides payments to physicians and surgeons in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, {{as well as for}} medically-necessary outpatient hospital services such as ER, laboratory, X-rays and diagnostic tests, certain preventative medical services, and certain durable medical equipment and supplies. Part C health plans, including Medicare Advantage plans, not only cover the same medical services as Parts A and B but also typically include an annual physical exam and vision and/or dental coverage of some sort not covered under Original Medicare. Less often, hearing and wellness benefits not found in Original Medicare are included in a Medicare Advantage plan. The most important difference between a Part C health plan and FFS Original Medicare is that all Part C plans, including capitated-fee Medicare Advantage plans, include a limit on <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> beneficiary will have to spend annually out of pocket; that amount is unlimited in Original Medicare.|$|E
25|$|In 1890, the {{election}} of {{several members of the}} labor-friendly Tennessee Farmers' Alliance among them Governor John P. Buchanan to the state government emboldened miners in the Coal Creek Valley to make several demands. One of the key demands was payment in cash rather than company scrip, which could either be used only at company-owned stores with marked up prices or redeemed for cash at a percentage of its value. Miners also demanded they be allowed to use their own checkweighmen the specialists who weighed the coal and determined <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> particular miner had earned instead of checkweighmen hired by the company. Since state laws already barred scrip payment and company-hired checkweighmen, most mine owners accepted the demands, though they {{were in the midst of}} an economic downturn. However, the Tennessee Coal Mining Company (TCMC), which operated a mine near Briceville, rejected the demands, and on April 1, 1891, shut down operations. Two months later, the company demanded its miners sign an iron-clad contract before returning to work. The miners refused.|$|E
