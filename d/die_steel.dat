The temperature fields of 3 Cr 2 Mo plastic <b>die</b> <b>steel</b> with the thickness 120 mm were calculated and analyzed under two quenching processes.

40|$|Soldering is {{a unique}} casting defect {{associated}} with die casting or metal mold casting of aluminum alloys. It occurs when molten aluminum sticks or solders {{the surface of the}} <b>die</b> <b>steel</b> and remains there after the ejection of the casting, causing a surface defect and dimensional inaccuracy of the castings and increased machine downtime. Soldering occurs easily when a bare <b>die</b> <b>steel</b> mold is used for die casting of aluminum alloys. When molten aluminum comes in contact with the <b>die</b> <b>steel</b> at a temperature higher than a critical temperature, the iron and aluminum atoms diffuse into each other, forming a series of intermetallic phases and a liquid aluminum-rich fcc phase. This liquid phase exists between intermetallic phases. On cooling, the liquid fcc phase solidifies on the intermetallic phases and grows into the casting, resulting in soldering. The critical temperature is the eutectic temperature near the aluminum corner of the phase diagram. If the die is protected using a nonreactive ceramic coating, soldering starts at locations where local coating failure occurs. Molten aluminum comes into contact with <b>die</b> <b>steel</b> through the coating failure locations and eats into the steel matrix, forming small pits. As these small pits grow, the coating is gradually removed and soldering becomes more severe. Details of die soldering step on a bare steel die and on a coated die material are discussed...|$|E
