5|$|The scheme {{presented}} in the table {{is known as the}} impedance analogy. Circuit diagrams produced using this analogy match the <b>electrical</b> <b>impedance</b> of the mechanical system seen by the electrical circuit, making it intuitive from an electrical engineering standpoint. There is also the mobility analogy, in which force corresponds to current and velocity corresponds to voltage. This has equally valid results but requires using the reciprocals of the electrical counterparts listed above. Hence, M → C, S → 1/L, D → G where G is electrical conductance, the inverse of resistance. Equivalent circuits produced by this scheme are similar, but are the dual impedance forms whereby series elements become parallel, capacitors become inductors, and so on. Circuit diagrams using the mobility analogy more closely match the mechanical arrangement of the circuit, making it more intuitive from a mechanical engineering standpoint. In addition to their application to electromechanical systems, these analogies are widely used to aid analysis in acoustics.|$|E

25|$|Suppression {{capacitors}} {{are effective}} interference reduction components because their <b>electrical</b> <b>impedance</b> decreases with increasing frequency, {{so that at}} higher frequencies they short circuit electrical noise and transients between the lines, or to ground.

25|$|A third wire, {{called the}} bond (or earth) wire, is often {{connected}} between non-current-carrying metal enclosures and earth ground. This conductor provides protection from electric shock due to accidental contact of circuit conductors with the metal chassis of portable appliances and tools. Bonding all non-current-carrying metal parts into one complete system ensures {{there is always}} a low <b>electrical</b> <b>impedance</b> path to ground sufficient to carry any fault current {{for as long as it}} takes for the system to clear the fault. This low impedance path allows the maximum amount of fault current, causing the overcurrent protection device (breakers, fuses) to trip or burn out as quickly as possible, bringing the electrical system to a safe state. All bond wires are bonded to ground at the main service panel, as is the neutral/identified conductor if present.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{impedance}} and {{neural response}} telemetry measurements through stimulation and recording of electrical signals can facilitate device fitting and parameter adjustments, especially in young children. However, the detailed configuration of <b>electrical</b> <b>impedances</b> and current distributions around the electrode array is unknown {{and has not}} been able to be determined using standard impedance telemetry measures. We therefore attempted to improve the impedance measurement procedure by applying a more detailed model of <b>electrical</b> <b>impedances</b> of stimulation and recording electrodes within the cochlea and by developing more sophisticated measurement protocols to identify the model parameters in a given implant subject. In particular, the modiolar currents, the portion of the currents assumed to be responsible for activating the neural elements, are determined and evaluated. Their predictive value for device fitting parameters is being investigated and first results have been obtained by a series of postoperative and intraoperative measurements, which will allow us to estimate changes of the modiolar current distributions over the first weeks after implantation. This approach is mainly based on a published patent, and makes use of the Nucleus Matlab Toolbox and the Nucleus Implant Communicator (NIC) software.

Measurement of the mucosal {{integrity is}} complex and time-consuming. <b>Electrical</b> tissue <b>impedance</b> spectroscopy (ETIS) is a device that measures impedance of tissue in vivo during endoscopy. In this study, we aimed to validate ETIS {{as a measure of}} esophageal mucosal integrity. <b>Electrical</b> tissue <b>impedance</b> spectroscopy measurements were performed during upper endoscopy in 12 GERD patients and 11 healthy controls after cessation of proton pump inhibition.

50|$|Usually {{analysis}} of a three-phase system is simplified by assuming balanced loading of all three phases. Steady-state operation is assumed, with no transient changes in power flow or voltage due to load or generation changes. The system frequency is also assumed to be constant. A further simplification {{is to use the}} per-unit system to represent all voltages, power flows, and impedances, scaling the actual target system values to some convenient base. A system one-line diagram is the basis to build a mathematical model of the generators, loads, buses, and transmission lines of the system, and their <b>electrical</b> <b>impedances</b> and ratings.|$|R
25|$|A driver with {{a higher}} maximum power rating cannot {{necessarily}} be driven to louder levels than a lower-rated one, since sensitivity and power handling are largely independent properties. In the examples that follow, assume (for simplicity) that the drivers being compared have the same <b>electrical</b> <b>impedance,</b> are operated at the same frequency within both driver's respective pass bands, and that power compression and distortion are low. For the first example, a speaker 3dB more sensitive than another produces double the sound power (is 3dB louder) for the same power input. Thus, a 100W driver ("A") rated at 92dB for 1W @ 1m sensitivity puts out twice as much acoustic power as a 200W driver ("B") rated at 89dB for 1W @ 1m when both are driven with 100W of input power. In this particular example, when driven at 100W, speaker A produces the same SPL, or loudness as speaker B would produce with 200W input. Thus, a 3dB increase in sensitivity of the speaker means that it needs half the amplifier power to achieve a given SPL. This translates into a smaller, less complex power amplifier—and often, to reduced overall system cost.|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for determining electrical percolation thresholds in carbon nanotube (CNT) networks when CNT lengths vary randomly. The random distribution in CNT lengths, commonly observed in practical processing and dispersion, was confirmed {{to be of}} the Weibull type. Nanocomposites consisting of both single- and multi-walled CNTs dispersed in reactive ethylene terpolymer were synthesized and the projected theoretical CNT volume concentrations required for electrical percolation were shown to closely correspond to the experimentally determined values. A metric for quantifying the degree of dispersion of nanostructures in polymers, based on information theory, is also suggested. The uniform dispersion of nanoparticles in polymer-based composites enhances material properties such as structural reinforcement, electromagnetic interference shielding, etc. The proposed measure of dispersion uses a quadrat- based sampling algorithm and the average Kullback-Leibler divergence is used to correlate randomness to the dispersion. This allows a quantitative comparison of cross -sectional images of nanostructure networks with different degrees of dispersion in a polymer. Finally, the complex <b>electrical</b> <b>impedances</b> of the nanocomposites were evaluated at different CNT aspect ratios and volume fractions in the 80 MHz - 500 MHz frequency range.
