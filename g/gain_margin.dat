25|$|When the {{open-loop}} gain has several poles, {{rather than the}} single pole of the above example, feedback can result in complex poles (real and imaginary parts). In a two-pole case, the result is peaking in the frequency response of the feedback amplifier near its corner frequency and ringing and overshoot in its step response. In the case {{of more than two}} poles, the feedback amplifier can become unstable and oscillate. See the discussion of <b>gain</b> <b>margin</b> and phase margin. For a complete discussion, see Sansen.|$|E

50|$|Usually system {{performance}} {{is described as}} robustness to instability (phase and <b>gain</b> <b>margins),</b> rejection to input and output noise disturbances and reference tracking.

40|$|In Part I of this paper, [1], we have {{developed}} a novel L 1 adaptive control architecture that enables fast adaptation and leads to uniformly bounded transient and asymptotic tracking for system’s both signals, input and output, simultaneously.

2500|$|Next, {{the choice}} of pole ratio τ1/τ2 {{is related to the}} phase margin of the {{feedback}} amplifier. where the gain flips sign, and this never happens in a two-pole system. If we know f180 for the amplifier at hand, the <b>gain</b> <b>margin</b> can be found approximately, but f180 then depends on the third and higher pole positions, as does the <b>gain</b> <b>margin,</b> unlike the estimate of phase margin, which is a two-pole estimate. [...] The procedure outlined in the Bode plot article is followed. Figure 5 is the Bode gain plot for the two-pole amplifier in the range of frequencies up to the second pole position. The assumption behind Figure 5 is that the frequency f0dB lies between the lowest pole at f1=1/(2πτ1) and the second pole at f2=1/(2πτ2). As indicated in Figure 5, this condition is satisfied for values ofα≥1.|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{function}} is to determine loop dynamics, also called stability. [...] This is how the loop responds to disturbances, such as changes in the reference frequency, changes of the feedback divider, or at startup. [...] Common considerations are the range over which the loop can achieve lock (pull-in range, lock range or capture range), how fast the loop achieves lock (lock time, lock-up time or settling time) and damping behavior. [...] Depending on the application, this may require {{one or more of}} the following: a simple proportion (gain or attenuation), an integral (low pass filter) and/or derivative (high pass filter). [...] Loop parameters commonly examined for this are the loop's <b>gain</b> <b>margin</b> and phase margin. [...] Common concepts in control theory including the PID controller are used to design this function.|$|E

5000|$|One {{measure of}} {{proximity}} to instability is the <b>gain</b> <b>margin.</b> The Bode phase plot locates the frequency where {{the phase of}} βAOL reaches &minus;180°, denoted here as frequency f180.
