5000|$|One {{method for}} {{analyzing}} <b>human</b> <b>reliability</b> is a straightforward extension of probabilistic risk assessment (PRA): {{in the same}} way that equipment can fail in a power plant, so can a human operator commit errors. In both cases, an analysis (functional decomposition for equipment and task analysis for humans) would articulate a level of detail for which failure or error probabilities can be assigned. This basic idea is behind the Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction (THERP). THERP is intended to generate human error probabilities that would be incorporated into a PRA. The Accident Sequence Evaluation Program (ASEP) <b>human</b> <b>reliability</b> procedure is a simplified form of THERP; an associated computational tool is Simplified Human Error Analysis Code (SHEAN). [...] More recently, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has published the Standardized Plant Analysis Risk - <b>Human</b> <b>Reliability</b> Analysis (SPAR-H) method to take account of the potential for human error.|$|E
