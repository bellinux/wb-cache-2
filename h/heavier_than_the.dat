5|$|From {{the pound}} {{down to the}} scruple, the English apothecaries' system was {{a subset of the}} Roman weight system except that the troy pound and its subdivisions were {{slightly}} <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Roman pound and its subdivisions. Similar systems were used all over Europe, but with considerable local variation described below under Variants.|$|E
5|$|The J75 {{engine was}} {{slightly}} <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> PS-13, and therefore required ballast {{to be placed}} in the nose to return the centre of gravity to the correct position. In addition, the Astra fire-control system was not ready, and it too, was replaced by ballast. The otherwise unused weapons bay was loaded with test equipment.|$|E
5|$|The smooth coat type of {{the breed}} closely resembles the Pražský Krysařík breed of the Czech Republic. The Pražský on average {{is a little}} shorter on leg and a little <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Russian Toy.|$|E

50|$|The {{game was}} more combat <b>heavy</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> {{previous}} releases {{in the series}} and there was less time spent in exploration mode. While {{the tone of the}} release was epic in scale, ultimately leading to an encounter with the dark goddess Takhisis, the game was marred by significant bugs.|$|R
50|$|Version 6 (2011): This is more bulky and <b>heavy</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> last 5 versions, mainly due to {{the fact}} it can move its arms. It wasn't {{received}} very well by buyers due to it not being very interactive. It also cannot cry real tears unlike the last 4 versions.|$|R
5|$|Two-seat trainer version. Armament {{reduced to}} a single 20mm gun and the oil cooler was {{relocated}} underneath the engine cowling. Fitted with a radio compass and gun camera. Considerably <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> fighter at , but it retained the flying characteristics of the single-seat aircraft. 584 built, the last two delivered in 1947.|$|E
5|$|During the Late Pleistocene, {{the more}} southerly {{occurring}} dire wolf (Canis dirus) {{had the same}} shape and proportions as the Yukon wolf, but the dire wolf subspecies C.dirusguildayi is estimated to have weighed on average , and the subspecies C.dirusdirus on average , with some specimens being larger. The dire wolf was <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Beringian wolf and possessed a more robust skull and dentition.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the modern}} (English, American and Imperial) troy ounces are roughly 1.5% <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> late Paris ounce, the exact {{historical}} {{relations between the}} original marc de Troyes, the French poids de marc, the Flemish trooisch pond and the English troy pound are unclear. It is known, however, that the numerical relation between the English and French troy ounces was exactly 64:63 in the 14th century.|$|E
50|$|There are, however, {{varieties}} {{of the traditional}} rye bread with wheat and whole grain added to make it less dense, but also called rúgbrauð. These varieties {{tend to be less}} <b>heavy</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> traditional straight rye variety and more similar to the modern Danish rugbrød or German pumpernickel.|$|R

5000|$|There are two {{versions}} of the album, with minor and major differences in three songs. The shorter version of [...] "Wild" [...] is more rock-based and <b>heavy</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> original. The shorter version of [...] "Violet" [...] contains no dialogue within the singing. Track lengths of both versions are given for each song affected. [...] "Killer" [...] is a re-recorded version of the UK number one single by Adamski, which also features Seal on vocals.|$|R
5|$|The Iron Duke-class {{ships were}} 622feet 9inches (189.9metres) long overall, {{and had a}} beam of 90ft (27.4m) and a draught of 29ft (8.8m). This was an {{increase}} of 25ft (7.7m) in length and 1ft (.3m) in width over the preceding King George V-class ships. The Iron Dukes displaced 25,000long tons (25,400tonnes). This was some 2,000tons (2,032tonnes) <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> preceding King George Vs, and was primarily due {{to the increase in}} calibre of the secondary battery.|$|E
5|$|Silver half dimes {{had been}} struck {{from the early days}} of the United States Mint in the late 18th century. Those {{disappeared}} from circulation, along with most other coins, in the economic turmoil of the Civil War. In 1864, the Mint successfully introduced low-denomination coins, whose intrinsic worth did not approach their face value. Industrialist Joseph Wharton advocated coins containing nickel—a metal in which he had significant financial interests. When the Mint proposed a copper-nickel five-cent piece, Congress required that the coin be <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Mint had suggested, allowing Wharton to sell more of the metal to the government.|$|E
5|$|The American forces {{reported}} 57 killed, 37 wounded, 17 {{missing and}} 6 captured, {{for a total}} of 117 casualties from the 19th and 29th Infantry Regiments. This number was far lighter than casualties for other unit actions of similar size so far in the war. North Korean casualties are unknown but believed to be far <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> American force. Actions in the Notch, as well as attacks on the region {{for the next few days}} are known to have largely destroyed the North Korean 6th Division, and over 50 percent of its force became casualties in the fighting.|$|E

5|$|The USMARC study {{indicated}} that Limousins were significantly the slowest of all breeds to achieve market end points of two measures of marbling score (70 to 160 days longer than the British breeds, and 65 to 70 days longer than the other continental European breeds) while feed conversion efficiency based on live weight gain was marginally poorer (12% less than the British breeds and comparable with the other continental European breeds). When feed conversion efficiency is adjusted to weight of saleable meat divided by feed consumed, Limousin feed conversion efficiency then exceeds both British and continental European breeds by 10–25%. The USMARC study also indicated that Limousins were very significantly the slowest of all breeds to achieve market specifications of three measures of rib eye fat (300 to 400 days longer than the British breeds, and 170 to 220 days longer than the other continental European breeds) while feed conversion efficiency based on live weight gain was poorer (25–30% less than the British breeds and 12–16% less than the other continental European breeds). When corrected to saleable meat divided by feed consumed, feed conversion efficiency was similar or marginally better for Limousins. At these end points, Limousins finished at markedly heavier live weights (up to 490kg <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> British breeds, and 190kg <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> other continental European breeds).|$|E
5|$|The close {{relationship}} between the katipo and redback is shown when mating, The male redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipo can not mate with the female redback as the male katipo is <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> male redback and when it approaches the web it triggers a predatory response in the female leading to the katipo being eaten before mating occurs. There is evidence of interbreeding between katipo and redbacks in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Adult non-breeding plumage is {{brownish}} {{with a dark}} {{neck and}} head marked with dark grey-brown. The eyes are surrounded with white, and the eyelids are pale. The bill is mostly pale grey, with a dark culmen and tip, but in early spring the tip may turn whitish. The underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are also whitish. The foreneck is whitish, usually forming wedge-shaped notch in dark neck-sides, and may sometimes reveal a shadowy trace of the neck ring or a pale collar. It has dark brownish grey upperparts with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders and some wing coverts spotted with white, which are usually concealed while swimming. The male and the female have similar appearances, although they exhibit sexual dimorphism in their physical dimensions with the male larger and significantly <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> female.|$|E

5|$|The LRDG {{vehicles}} were mainly two wheel drive, chosen {{because they were}} lighter and used less fuel than four wheel drive. They were stripped of all non-essentials, including doors, windscreens and roofs. They were fitted with a bigger radiator, a condenser system, built up leaf springs for the harsh terrain, wide, low pressure desert tyres, sand mats and channels, plus map containers and a sun compass devised by Bagnold. Wireless trucks had special compartments built into the bodywork to house wireless equipment. Initially the LRDG patrols were equipped with one Canadian Military Pattern (CMP) Ford 15 cwt F15 truck for the commander, {{while the rest of}} the patrol used up to 10 Chevrolet 30 cwt wide-body (WB) trucks. From March 1941 the 30 cwt Chevrolets were replaced by the CMP Ford 30 cwt F30, although in some ways this was a retrograde step; because they were four wheel drive and <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Chevrolets, they used twice as much fuel, which in turn reduced the range of a patrol. From March 1942 the Fords were progressively replaced by 200 Canadian Chevrolet 1533 X2 30 cwts, which had been specially ordered for the LRDG. From July 1942 Willys Jeeps began to be issued for the patrol commander and patrol sergeant.|$|E
5|$|The Danubian {{emperors}} {{were especially}} {{concerned with the}} depopulation of the border provinces due to plague and barbarian invasions during the Crisis. The problem was especially acute in their own Danubian home provinces, where much arable land {{had fallen out of}} cultivation through lack of manpower. The depopulation was thus a serious threat to army recruitment and supply. In response, the Danubian Junta pursued an aggressive policy of resettling defeated barbarian tribesmen on imperial territory on a massive scale. Aurelian moved a large number of Carpi to Pannonia in 272. (In addition, by 275 he evacuated the province of Dacia, removing the entire provincial population to Moesia, an act largely motivated by the same problem). His successor Probus is recorded as transferring 100,000 Bastarnae to Moesia in 279/80 and later equivalent numbers of Gepids, Goths and Sarmatians. Diocletian continued the policy, transferring in 297 huge numbers of Bastarnae, Sarmatians and Carpi (the entire latter tribe, according to Victor). Although the precise terms under which these people were settled in the empire are unknown (and may have varied), the common feature was the grant of land in return for an obligation of military service much <b>heavier</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> normal conscription quota. The policy had the triple benefit, from the Roman government's point of view, of weakening the hostile tribe, repopulating the plague-ravaged frontier provinces (and bringing their abandoned fields back into cultivation) and providing a pool of first-rate recruits for the army. But it could also be popular with the barbarian prisoners, who were often delighted by the prospect of a land grant within the empire. In the 4th century, such communities were known as laeti.|$|E

5|$|Down on the Upside is {{the fifth}} studio album by the American rock band Soundgarden, {{released}} on May 21, 1996, through A Records. It is the band's third album with bassist Ben Shepherd. Following a worldwide tour in support of its previous album, Superunknown (1994), Soundgarden commenced work on a new album. Self-produced by the band, the music on the album was notably less <b>heavy</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> group's preceding albums and featured the band experimenting with other sounds.|$|R
