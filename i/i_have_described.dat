5|$|I am vexed and {{surprised}} at your not thinking {{the situation of}} Maria sufficiently important, and can only account for this want of – shall I say it? delicacy of feeling, by recollecting {{that you are a}} man – For my part I cannot suppose any situation more distressing than for a woman of sensibility with an improving mind to be bound, to such a man as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>described,</b> for life – obliged to renounce all the humanizing affections, and to avoid cultivating her taste lest her perception of grace, and refinement of sentiment should sharpen to agony the pangs of disappointment.|$|E
25|$|The actual {{existence}} of far-reaching type-differences, of which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>described</b> eight groups in , has {{enabled me to}} conceive the two controversial theories of neurosis as manifestations of a type-antagonism. This discovery brought with it the need {{to rise above the}} opposition and to create a theory which would do justice not merely to one or the other side, but to both equally (Jung, 1966: pars. 65-66).|$|E
25|$|On Jefferson's {{isolated}} mountaintop, sex {{took place}} {{as part of}} a hierarchy that everyone involved understood. Jefferson, and those of his class, did not share our current understanding of sexual morality. Sally Hemings was his servant, and had little power. She was dependent economically, though this does not mean her feelings were irrelevant. But it does mean that he had extraordinary power, and she very little, and so, as his concubine, she had probably replicated her mother's relationship with Jefferson's father-in-law; for she was, in fact, Jefferson's late wife's half-sister, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>described</b> the Hemings family as a parallel, subordinate family to the all-white Jeffersons.|$|E

If {{you try to}} steal again the eye will see, an' then the torture <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>describe</b> will be yours. I am Wampus. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> spoke." ...|$|R
500|$|The comet brightened rapidly, {{and within}} days {{had become an}} {{exceptionally}} bright object. Her Majesty's Astronomer at the Cape, David Gill, reported watching the comet rise {{a few minutes before}} the Sun on 18 September, and described it as [...] "The nucleus was then undoubtedly single, and certainly rather under than over 4″ in diameter; in fact, as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>described</b> it, it resembled very much a star of the 1st magnitude seen by daylight.

2500|$|George Bush, {{speaking}} in October 2002, said that [...] "The stated {{policy of the}} United States is regime change. ... However, if Saddam were to meet all {{the conditions of the}} United Nations, the conditions that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>described</b> very clearly in terms that everybody can understand, that in itself will signal the regime has changed". Citing reports from certain intelligence sources, Bush stated on 6 March 2003 that he believed that Saddam was not complying with UN Resolution 1441.|$|E
2500|$|He {{had never}} been to Ireland before, and met and stayed with Lord Hillsborough, who he {{believed}} was especially attentive. Franklin noted of him that [...] "all the plausible behaviour <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>described</b> is meant only, by patting and stroking the horse, to make him more patient, while the reins are drawn tighter, and the spurs set deeper into his sides." [...] In Dublin, Franklin was invited to sit with the members of the Irish Parliament rather than in the gallery. He was the first American to receive this honor. While touring Ireland, he was moved by the level of poverty he saw. Ireland's economy was affected by the same trade regulations and laws of Britain that governed America. Franklin feared that America could suffer the same effects should Britain's [...] "colonial exploitation" [...] continue.|$|E

6000|$|... "And was she not his sister?" [...] asked Eustace Bright. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{thought of}} it sooner, <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> <b>described</b> her as a maiden lady, who kept a pet owl!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>has</b> {{never been}} <b>I</b> who <b>have</b> <b>described</b> my entertainments," [...] he {{reminded}} her. [...] "They {{have been called}} everything--orgies, debauches--everything you can think of. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never ventured myself to describe them." ...|$|R
2500|$|.....think of the {{following}} use of language: I send someone shopping. I give him a slip marked 'five red apples'. He takes the slip to the shopkeeper, who opens the drawer marked 'apples', then he looks up the word 'red' in a table and finds a colour sample opposite it; then he says the series of cardinal numbers—I assume that he knows them by heart—up to the word 'five' and for each number he takes an apple of the same colour as the sample out of the drawer.—It is in this and similar ways that one operates with words—"But how does he know where and how he is to look up the word 'red' and what he is {{to do with the}} word 'five'?" [...] Well, I assume that he acts as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>described.</b> Explanations come to an end somewhere.—But what is {{the meaning of the word}} 'five'? No such thing was in question here, only how the word 'five' is used.|$|E

60|$|I {{send you}} many cordial {{thanks for your}} note, and the very curious drawing {{accompanying}} it. I ought to tell you, perhaps, that the opium smoking <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>described,</b> I saw (exactly as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>described</b> it, penny ink-bottle and all) down in Shadwell this last autumn. A couple of the Inspectors of Lodging-Houses knew the woman and took me to her as I was making a round with them to see for myself the working of Lord Shaftesbury's Bill.|$|E
60|$|The {{reader will}} now ask, {{naturally}} enough, {{how such a}} heap of beds as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>described</b> can take the shape of mountains like Snowdon.|$|E
60|$|The mystery was too great--great {{enough to}} throw off its balance {{the mind of a}} young man who had {{witnessed}} such a fearsome scene as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>described.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'By {{this time}} Miss H. had laid aside her book, and came forward quite startled, {{and told me}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{accurately}} <b>described</b> a scene on a race-course in Scotland which she had witnessed just a week or two before--a scene that had very often been in her thoughts, but, as we were strangers to each other, she had never mentioned. She also said <b>I</b> <b>had</b> exactly <b>described</b> her own feelings at the time, and had brought it all back in a most vivid manner.|$|R
60|$|I shall now {{provide the}} proof that David {{believed}} {{it all to}} be as true as true. It was told me by Oliver, who had it from our hero himself. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>described</b> to them how the savages had tattooed David's father, and Oliver informed me that one night shortly afterward David was discovered softly lifting the blankets off his father's legs {{to have a look}} at the birds and reptiles etched thereon.|$|R

60|$|I do {{not mean}} to dwell with particularity on the details of my experience. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>described</b> these two cases at length, because they had definite, clearly {{traceable}} results in my after-lot.|$|E
6000|$|I sent [...] "The Corn Husking" [...] to the New American Magazine, {{and almost}} by return mail the editor, William Wyckoff, wrote an inspiring {{letter to the}} effect that the life <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>described</b> was {{familiar}} to him, and that it had never been treated in this way. [...] "I shall be very glad to read anything you have written or may write, and I suggest that you follow up this article by others of the same nature." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{novel is}} set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago.
