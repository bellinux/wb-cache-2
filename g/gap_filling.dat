[...] Yeast lacking Pol4 {{are unable}} to join 3' {{overhangs}} that require <b>gap</b> <b>filling,</b> but remain proficient for <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> at 5' overhangs. [...] This is because the primer terminus used to initiate DNA synthesis is less stable at 3' overhangs, necessitating a specialized NHEJ polymerase.|$|E

After studying {{the effects of}} various processes in STI (Shallow Trench Isolation) module with SAC OX free scheme on GOI, {{it was found that}} the dominant process that could degrade GOI was the STI HDP (High Density Plasma) <b>gap</b> <b>fill</b> process. STI HDP <b>gap</b> <b>fill</b> process could cause Si damage on AA corners, also named as AA clipping, which will result in irregular corners and hence a thinner gate oxide formation at imperfect AA corners. This was observed by a TEM (transmission electron microscopy) study. In SAC OX free scheme, the exposed AA Si corners that were damaged during the HDP process did not get consumed and repaired while they would have gotten in the scheme with SAC OX and hence degraded GOI. By optimizing the STI <b>gap</b> <b>fill</b> processes and hardware configuration, the AA clipping can be greatly reduced and GOI can be improved to the required level...|$|R

40|$|Copper {{chemical}} vapor deposition using liquid coinjection of the Cu(I) precursor (hfac) Cu(TMVS) {{along with}} TMVS has been demonstrated. The coinjection of TMVS with (hfac) Cu(TMVS) stabilizes the Cu precursor until it enters the reaction chamber, allowing for better control of the deposition and faster deposition rates. Using this technique, we have grown films with as-deposited resistivities of 1. 86 {plus_minus} 0. 04 {mu}{Omega}-cm, independent of film thickness. Deposition rates of well over 100 nm/min are possible. Good step coverage and <b>gap</b> <b>fill</b> down to 0. 6 {mu}m lines is demonstrated, with <b>gap</b> <b>fill</b> being limited by the large Cu grain sizes in these films...|$|R

Dep-etch-dep approach would help to extend the <b>gap</b> <b>fill</b> application of HARP process. But in FinFET STI or PMD with RMG integration where “V ” shape profile is difficult to be realized due to their unique integration flows, a FCVD process is needed to fulfill the gap-fill requirement. Excellent FCVD gap-fill has been demonstrated in high AR ratio FinFET STI and PMD even with straight vertical or reentrant profile. Some integration challenges like poor wet resistance and FCVD induced structured bending are addressed...|$|R

For a univariate time series, the SSA <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> procedure utilizes temporal correlations to fill in the missing points. For a multivariate data set, <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> by M-SSA takes advantage of both spatial and temporal correlations. In either case: (i) estimates of missing data points are produced iteratively, and are then used to compute a self-consistent lag-covariance matrix [...] and its EOFs and (ii) cross-validation is used to optimize the window width [...] and the number of leading SSA modes to fill the gaps with the iteratively estimated [...] "signal," [...] while the noise is discarded.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis article revives the {{discussion}} over measurements of validity in criterion referenced (CR) tests. It presents how {{the principles of}} Classical Testing Theory (CTT), normally associated with norm-referenced tests, were applied to the Business English achievement tests at the University of Economics, Prague, Czech Republic. Firstly, measures of validity in criterion-referenced tests, test purpose, and test specifications are discussed. Next, a 10 -item vocabulary <b>gap</b> <b>fill</b> subtest is subjected to a detailed analysis {{through the use of}} facility and discrimination indices. Key and distractor analyses of each item are then performed. The insights gained from such analyses are examined in relation to the cyclical test design process of constant review of items so that a high level of standardization is achieved. This paper thus provides teachers with simple tools to build valid language <b>gap</b> <b>fill</b> tests which reflect the criteria of accurate and equitable testing...|$|R

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, the <b>gap</b> <b>filling</b> process in Broca’s {{patients}} was significantly impaired.

The researchers argue, based on these results, that neurological damage to the left anterior cortex implicates this region in resolving gap-filling operations during sentence comprehension.|$|E
