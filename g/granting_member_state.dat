40|$|Almost {{exactly a}} decade ago, the Court of Justice {{delivered}} its first judgments on golden shares <b>granting</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> special rights in privatized companies. Since then, the Court {{has dealt with}} the problem of golden shares at regular intervals. However, in spite of the growing body of case law, clear principles to determine when special rights of public shareholders constitute a restriction on the free movement of capital have not yet emerged. The case law of the Court of Justice develops on an ad hoc basis, and the Court seems to be guided by a general conviction that State involvement in private enterprises should be confined, rather than by discernible legal principles. This article seeks to rationalize the golden shares case law and assess the delimiting criteria proposed by the Court. In order to examine the case law in a structured way, the article draws a distinction between two types of State intervention in the control of companies: "regulatory acts" and "shareholder acts"...|$|R
40|$|The 2003 {{reforms of}} the Common Agricultural Policy of the Euro-pean Union allowed for {{discretionary}} implementation among <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> Discretion was allowed {{with respect to the}} timing and the degree of decoupling of policy support. Differences among <b>member</b> <b>states</b> were particularly apparent in the European beef and veal sector. Using weekly data from 2003 to 2009, we assess the consequences of different national implementation strategies of the reforms on market integration for young calves, which are intensively traded in the European Union. Time series properties are analyzed with a range unit-root test after which a multivariate cointegration model is estimated. We find that the calf markets in Germany, France, the Netherlands and Spain are integrated and tightly interrelated as evidenced by both short and long-run price transmis-sion. We also find strong statistical support for the hypothesis that decoupling reduced calf price levels. Additionally, we ascertain that the outbreak of the Blue Tongue disease induced a structural change in parts of the EU calf market.

40|$|The Article {{explores the}} mini-body of {{antitrust}} provisions {{to be found}} within TRIPs. It advocates a general-principles based and systematic interpretative approach of these provisions {{with a view to}} finding in them an antidote to the ratcheting up of IP protection otherwise encouraged by TRIPs. In this framework, it is argued that member countries retain considerable flexibility to incorporate pro-competitive inputs and to give appropriate consideration to non-intellectual property interests in adopting legislation at the intersection of antitrust and IP. The Article further develops criteria to assess the TRIPs-compatibility both of antitrust intervention and of generalized, ex ante legislative measures intended to fine-tune the design of IP regimes to adequately take into account the interests of current users and future generations of innovators. Five case studies are presented discussing technology transfer, local working requirements in patent laws, refusal to deal in IP, essential facilities doctrine and software patents, with a view to testing the hypothesis {{in the light of the}} first reports by WTO panels in intellectual property cases. In this perspective, it turns out that, while consideration of TRIPs antitrust provision does not provide a complete remedy to IP overprotection, still it may make a significant contribution towards <b>granting</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> fluidity in designing their IP regimes...|$|R

50|$|The {{investigation}} was originally opened by the European Commissioner for Competition {{on behalf of}} the European Commission in June 2014. The Ireland case was opened in conjunction with two other similar cases; involving Starbucks (Netherlands) and Fiat (Luxembourg). The commissioner noted concerns that it believed discretion in transfer pricing rules had been used in the case of Apple to grant a selective advantage to the company. They believed that this violated Article 107(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Article 107(1) states that aid <b>granted</b> by <b>member</b> <b>states</b> cannot threaten to distort competition. In particular they are addressing the Irish tax rulings from 1991 and 2007 by the Irish Office of the Revenue Commissioner.

The Commission claims the pricing arrangement between Apple and Ireland was not supported by an economic assessment and was in part supported by employment considerations.|$|R
30|$|<b>Member</b> <b>States</b> were {{initially}} slow to adopt CO 2 -based fiscal measures. In 2002, only the UK and the Netherlands had adopted measures to align car taxes along CO 2 emissions.

A further increase of dieselization beyond the ‘natural cap’ provided by the average composition of raw oil (about 40 %) could however fuel anti-diesel initiatives and become problematic for the automobile industry[98]. ACEA's negative stance towards Member States' adoption of CO 2 -based car taxation was thus tempered.
