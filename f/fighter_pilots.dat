5|$|On 5 June 1984, two Saudi Arabian <b>fighter</b> <b>pilots</b> {{shot down}} two Iranian F-4 fighters. The Royal Saudi Air Force pilots were flying American-built F-15s and fired air-to-air {{missiles}} {{to bring down}} the Iranian planes. The Saudi <b>fighter</b> <b>pilots</b> had KC-135 aerial tanker planes and Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS surveillance planes assist in the encounter. The aerial fight occurred in Saudi airspace over the Gulf near the Saudi island Al Arabiyah, about 60 miles northeast of Jubail.|$|E

5|$|During the Korean War, USAF <b>fighter</b> <b>pilots</b> were outclassed by MiG-equipped Soviet pilots. Lockheed engineers, led by Kelly Johnson, {{designed}} and submitted a novel design to the Air Force, notable for its sleekness, particularly its thin wings and missile-shaped fuselage, {{as well as}} a novel pilot ejection system.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fighter</b> <b>pilots</b> {{received}} no instrument training until very {{late in the}} war, after the training course had already been curtailed because of fuel shortages {{and the need to}} produce pilots more quickly to replace losses. Galland also did not make sure all-weather flying was incorporated into pilot training, which was of decisive importance in an effective air defence force.|$|E
5|$|The Hellcats and Fireflies {{were first}} to attack, and strafed {{anti-aircraft}} positions {{as well as}} the destroyer Z33 and small patrol craft Vp 6307. The patrol craft was forced aground and later declared a total loss. Due to the thick smoke, the <b>fighter</b> <b>pilots</b> were only able to locate targets by aiming at the sources of tracer gunfire.|$|E

50|$|Captain Moak served {{nine years}} a United States Marine Corps <b>fighter</b> <b>pilot</b> flying F-4s and F-18s. He later transitioned to the Naval Air Reserve Forces (1988-2001) {{to finish his}} {{military}} career as a U.S. Navy <b>fighter</b> <b>pilot</b> flying F-18s.|$|R
5|$|A flying ace or fighter ace is a {{military}} aviator credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft during aerial combat (The Germans traditionally set the threshold at 10 victories.). During World War II, hundreds of German Luftwaffe <b>fighter</b> <b>pilots</b> achieved this feat flying contemporary piston engine fighter aircraft. However, only 28 pilots are credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft while flying a jet-powered aircraft.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the attack, Diệm ordered that all VNAF {{aircraft}} be grounded, and all aerial combat missions suspended while his security officials investigated <b>fighter</b> <b>pilots</b> for any possible anti-regime tendencies. This was achieved by placing tanks on the runway at Bien Hoa Air Base. Without assistance from accompanying fighter craft, the U.S. deemed it too risky for American helicopters to operate in the jungles against the communists.|$|E
5|$|In 1981 Nordmann {{attended}} an aviation symposium of the International Order of Characters (IOC) held in Stamford, Connecticut.

5|$|No. 6 Squadron {{was formed}} at Parkhouse, England, on 15 June 1917 as a flying {{training}} {{unit of the}} Australian Flying Corps (AFC). The unit was initially designated No.30 (Australian Training) Squadron, Royal Flying Corps and its role was to train <b>fighter</b> <b>pilots</b> for service with No.2 Squadron of the AFC (which was designated No.68 (Australian) Squadron RFC at the time) on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{designated}} the TB-7, the aircraft was renamed the Pe-8 after its primary designer, Vladimir Petlyakov, {{died in a}} plane crash in 1942. Supply problems complicated the aircraft's production and the Pe-8s also had engine problems. As Soviet morale boosters, they were also high-value targets for the Luftwaffe's <b>fighter</b> <b>pilots.</b> The loss rate of these aircraft, whether from mechanical failure, friendly fire, or combat, doubled between 1942 and 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds {{is based}} on the {{enactment}} Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 613 of 28 September 1941 to reward those servicemen who had already been awarded the Oak Leaves with Swords to the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Ultimately, it would be awarded to twenty-seven German soldiers, sailors and airmen, ranging from young <b>fighter</b> <b>pilots</b> to field marshals. Two recipients were members of the U-boat arm.|$|E

5|$|The giraffe {{has also}} been used for some {{scientific}} experiments and discoveries. Scientists {{have looked at the}} properties of giraffe skin when developing suits for astronauts and <b>fighter</b> <b>pilots</b> because the people in these professions are in danger of passing out if blood rushes to their legs. Computer scientists have modeled the coat patterns of several subspecies using reaction–diffusion mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|A-10s were {{initially}} an unwelcome addition {{to many in}} the Air Force. Most pilots switching to the A-10 {{did not want to}} because <b>fighter</b> <b>pilots</b> traditionally favored speed and appearance. In 1987, many A-10s were shifted to the forward air control (FAC) role and redesignated OA-10. In the FAC role, the OA-10 is typically equipped with up to six pods of 2.75inch (70mm) Hydra rockets, usually with smoke or white phosphorus warheads used for target marking. OA-10s are physically unchanged and remain fully combat capable despite the redesignation.|$|E
5|$|Braham had {{destroyed}} 12 enemy aircraft with one probable and four damaged {{and was one}} of the most successful RAF night <b>fighter</b> <b>pilots.</b> In recognition of his experience he was then given command of No. 141 Squadron RAF at RAF Ford on 23 December 1942 as a 22-year-old wing commander. With him went his AI operator Gregory, now a flying officer with the DFC and Distinguished Flying Medal. Three weeks later, on 20 January 1943, Braham claimed a Do 217.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} seven years {{following}} 1988, when the CF-18 was being delivered, the squadron ran six-month full-squadron courses from which the graduating pilots formed new CF-18 squadrons. Following this initial cadre of courses, No.410 Squadron trained CF-18 pilots {{at a rate of}} approximately 50 per year. In 1992, with the closure of three squadrons in Germany, this was reduced to 25. With the recent reduction in size of the remaining operational squadrons, No.410 Squadron now trains approximately 20 <b>fighter</b> <b>pilots</b> annually.|$|E
5|$|Hartmann, a pre-war glider pilot, {{joined the}} Luftwaffe in 1940 and {{completed}} his fighter pilot training in 1942. He was posted to Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG52) on the Eastern Front and {{was fortunate to}} be placed {{under the supervision of}} some of the Luftwaffes most experienced <b>fighter</b> <b>pilots.</b> Under their guidance, Hartmann steadily developed his tactics, which earned him the coveted Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds on 25 August 1944 for claiming 301 aerial victories. At the time of its presentation to Hartmann, this was Germany's highest military decoration.|$|E
