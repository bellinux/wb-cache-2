40|$|Aim. Periodontal remodellng {{produced}} during dental orthodontic treatment represents {{a series of}} biologicallyactive substances, part of them playing some role in the initiation and propagation of inflammatory processes. The present study aims at demonstrating the MMP 8, MMP 9 and TIMP 1 levels intervening in tissular periodontal remodeling {{produced during}} orthodontic treatments, accompanied by gingival overgrowth, as a reaction of the marginal periodontium to mechanical stress. Materials and Method. Selected for the study were 21 patients – 13 females and 8 males – with ages between 13 and 32 years (17. 6 ± 1. 3 years) affected with dento-maxillary anomalies, who received orthodontic treatment with <b>fixed</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Sampling from the gingival fluid was performed 6 times, namely: 1 hour prior to {{the application of the}} orthodontic apparatus, 4 hours after its application, again after 8 and 24 hours and then 1 and, respectively, 2 weeks later. If gingival hypertrophy was installed (HTG), the hypertrophic gingiva was removed, and an immuno-histo-chemical examination was made. The patient was weekly monitorized in the first 6 weeks – during the initial orthodontic treatment, then monthly, samples being taken over from the gingival sulcus on each visit made in the first 6 weeks. Results. MMP- 9 immuno-marking was positive both at corione level and in the deep structures of the covering epithelium. The positive cells at MMP- 9 evidenced different intensities at the level of each structure forming the gingival mucous membrane. In four of the cases under analysis, disorganization of the normal layering/stratification of the epithelium was evidenced, along with the presence of numerous red cells in the chorione of the mucous membrane. In such cases, immuno-marking to MMP 8 showed a normal intensity, even if few positive cells, dispersed among the extravasated red cells could be observed. Immunologically, MMP 8 and MMP 9 obey the same pattern, registering maximum values in the first 8 hours after the application of the orthodontic device, after which they begin to decrease, returning to the baseline in the first 2 weeks, for the cases having not developed HTG, while continuing to increase in those demonstrating HTG. The TIMP 1 levels in GCF are more strongly correlated with those of MMP 8 and not with those of MMP 9. Conclusions. MMP 8, MMP 9 and TIMP 1 evolution in various time moments of the orthodontic treatment evidences their involvement in the occurrence of HTG...|$|E

Field-reversed {{configurations}} (FRCs) {{sustained by}} rotating magnetic fields (RMFs) with spatial highharmonic components {{have been studied}} in the metal flux conserver of the FRC injection experiment (<b>FIX)</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The high-harmonic RMF method has some unique features; (1) field lines of the RMF do not penetrate or cross the vessel wall, (2) selective penetration/exclusion of the fundamental/high harmonic RMF component {{will result in a}} generation of effective magnetic pressure near the separatrix, which helps to keep the separatrix away from the vessel wall, (3) strong azimuthal non-uniformity of the RMF will bring about the n = 4 deformation of the core FRC plasma, which will suppress the destructive modes caused by the rotation of the plasma column. The RMF with spatial high-harmonic components will provide quasi-steady current drive of high-beta FRC plasmas without destructive n = 2 rotational mode and will be helpful in reducing the particle loss and thermal load when applied to the fusion core plasma. 1...|$|R

Aim of research – to study state of the oral fluid and buccal epithelium cells (BEC) {{in the course of}} a complex orthodontic treatment of children with thyroid gland diseases. In 79 children with a diffuse nontoxic goiter (DNG) of the I-III degrees, stability of oral fluid pH (ΔpH), rate of mobile nuclei of BEC, ratio of electrophoretic displacement range of nuclei and plasmolemms was estimated. Estimation of corresponding parameters in the initial state, in 1, 3, 6 and 8 months after fixation of the <b>fixed</b> orthodontic <b>apparatus</b> was carried out. Children of the basic group according to pathology degree in addition received a prophylactic complex including preparations: “Vitrum Perfomens", "Teraflex", "Kalcicor", «Potassium iodide», «Echinacea compositum C», "Lizodent", "Osteobios". Ap¬plication of the prophylactic complex in orthodontic treatment of children with DNG prevented growth of ΔрН after fixation of brackets. Throughout all time of supervision it promoted reduction of this rate which slightly exceeded average rate for the given age of children in 8 months. Application of this prophylactic complex already in 1 month after fixation of brackets has raised quantity of mobile BEC nuclei by 44 % and by 1, 64 times has increased the relation of ranges of plasmolemms and nuclei displacement. In 8 months of supervision percent of mobile nuclei BEC and the relation of Apl/Aya in the basic group was by 2 times more, than in a comparison group, approaching to average rate. Сhildren with thyroid gland diseases need active treatment-and-prophylactic measures at stages of active apparatus treatment.

The steel thus obtained showed the propertie extremely suitable for dental use, having the following mechaniccal values. Hv(0. 5) = 500,_ = 170 kgmm^ 2,_ε = 5 ～ 7 % The corrosion reistance was exarnined by immersing in the four standard reaqents HCl, Na_ 2 S, C_ 3 H_ 6 O_ 3,NaCl, at 37 C. A slight change was observed in its color and weight in cases of hydrochloric acid and sodiurn chloride, but no appreciable changes were found even in its 60 days adaptation in oral cavity.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} growth light intensity on the photosynthetic apparatus of pea (Pisum sativum) thylakoid membranes. Plants were grown either in a growth chamber at light intensities that ranged from 8 to 1050 microeinsteins per square meter per second, or outside under natural sunlight. In thylakoid membranes we determined: the amounts of active and inactive photosystem II, photosystem I, cytochrome b/f, and high potential cytochrome b 559, the rate of uncoupled electron transport, and the ratio of chlorophyll a to b. In leaves we determined: the amounts of the photosynthetic components per leaf area, the fresh weight per leaf area, the rate of electron transport, and the light compensation point. To minimize factors other than growth light intensity that may alter the photosynthetic apparatus, we focused on peas grown above the light compensation point (20 - 40 microeinsteins per square meter per second), and harvested only the unshaded leaves {{at the top of}} the plant. The maximum difference in the concentrations of the photosynthetic components was about 30 % in thylakoids isolated from plants grown over a 10 -fold range in light intensity, 100 to 1050 microeinsteins per square meter per second. Plants grown under natural sunlight were virtually indistinguishable from plants grown in growth chambers at the higher light intensities. On a leaf area basis, over the same growth light regime, the maximum difference in the concentration of the photosynthetic components was also about 30 %. For peas grown at 1050 microeinsteins per square meter per second we found the concentrations of active photosystem II, photosystem I, and cytochrome b/f were about 2. 1 millimoles per mol chlorophyll. There were an additional 20 to 33 % of photosystem II complexes that were inactive. Over 90 % of the heme-containing cytochrome f detected in the thylakoid membranes was active in linear electron transport. Based on these data, we do not find convincing evidence that the stoichiometries of the electron transport components in the thylakoid membrane, the size of the light-harvesting system serving the reaction centers, or the concentration of the photosynthetic components per leaf area, are regulated in response to different growth light intensities. The concept that emerges from this work is of a relatively <b>fixed</b> photosynthetic <b>apparatus</b> in thylakoid membranes of peas grown above the light compensation point...|$|R
