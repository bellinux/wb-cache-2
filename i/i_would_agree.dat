In January 2010, at the House Republican annual retreat, Obama called Ryan's budget proposal a [...] "serious proposal" [...] finding both points of agreement and disagreement, saying [...] "some ideas in there ... that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> with, {{but there are some}} ideas that we should have a healthy debate about because I don't agree with them". Chief Actuary of Medicare Rick Foster compared Ryan's [...] "Roadmap" [...] with the 2010 healthcare reform in congressional hearings, stating that while both had [...] "some potential" [...] to make healthcare prices [...] "more sustainable," [...] he was more [...] "confident" [...] in Ryan's plan. Economist and columnist Paul Krugman criticized Ryan's plan as making overly optimistic assumptions and proposing tax cuts for the wealthy. Krugman also called the plan a [...] "fraud" [...] saying it relied on severe cuts in domestic discretionary spending and [...] "dismantling Medicare as we know it" [...] by suggesting the voucher system, which he noted was similar to a failed attempt at reform in 1995. In contrast, columnist Ramesh Ponnuru, writing in the National Review, argued that Ryan's plan would lead to less debt than current budgets. Economist Ted Gayer wrote that [...] "Ryan's vision of broad-based tax reform, which essentially would shift us toward a consumption tax ... makes a useful contribution to this debate." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2005, ADL National Director Abraham Foxman {{called it}} hypocritical for hip-hop {{producer}} Russell Simmons to lead an ad campaign against anti-Semitism while also, according to Foxman's view, defending or excusing Louis Farrakhan's anti-Semitic statements. Later that year the ADL urged prominent black leaders including Simmons to reconsider {{their support for}} Farrakhan and Malik Zulu Shabazz organizing the Millions More Movement and to [...] "stand up" [...] against black anti-Semitism. Simmons, responding to ADL Director Abraham Foxman, said, [...] "simply put, you are misguided, arrogant, and very disrespectful of African Americans, and most importantly, your statements will unintentionally or intentionally lead to a negative impression of Jews {{in the minds of}} millions of African Americans". [...] Foxman replied, [...] "If there were a Jewish event which was led by an out-and-out racist, I would expect Black leaders to say to me that ADL should {{have nothing to do with}} it. And <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> with them, rather than condemn them for their action." ...|$|E

2500|$|Metropolitan John Zizioulas, while {{maintaining}} the explicit Orthodox position of the Father as the single origin and source of the Holy Spirit, declared that [...] shows positive signs of reconciliation. Zizioulas states: [...] "Closely related {{to the question of}} the single cause is the problem of the exact meaning of the Son's involvement in the procession of the Spirit. Gregory of Nyssa explicitly admits a 'mediating' role of the Son in the procession of the Spirit from the Father. Is this role to be expressed with the help of the preposition [...] (through) the Son (...) , as Maximus and other Patristic sources seem to suggest?" [...] Zizioulas continues: [...] "The Vatican statement notes that this is 'the basis that must serve for the continuation of the current theological dialogue between Catholic and Orthodox'. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> with this, adding that the discussion should take place in the light of the 'single cause' principle to which I have just referred."

2500|$|Rivette's {{early years}} in Paris were impoverished and {{he was known to}} live ascetically on minimal resources; Chabrol said that he was very thin and hardly ate, {{comparing}} his smile to that of the Cheshire Cat. Gruault described Rivette as [...] "slight, dark-haired and had very lively dark eyes in an emaciated visage of a waxy pallor…add to that a forced, nervous smile of someone who has to make constant efforts to win acceptance by a society that he seemed to regard as irremediably hostile." [...] His opinions were highly regarded among his peers and according to Douchet, [...] " [...] was the great talker. He was the group's secret soul, the occult thinker, a bit of a censor." [...] Godard said, [...] "I might like a film very much, but if Rivette said 'It's no good' then <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> with him ... it was as though he had a privileged access to cinematographic truth." [...] Truffaut considered Rivette his best friend, and they were frequently seen at screenings. Truffaut said that in the 1950s, Rivette was {{the only member of the}} group already capable of directing a feature film.|$|E
2500|$|Who is {{homosexual}}? My {{answer is}} that a homosexual is somebody who is abnormal because the normal person was created to be attracted to the opposite sex ... to procreate and perpetuate the human race. ... y bishop of North Ankole, Rt. Rev. Muhanguzi ... asked the following question: ... How can God contradict himself by saying in the Book of Genesis that Adam {{should be given a}} wife, Eve, and then also create homosexuals? ... However, now that I have been forced to concentrate my mind on this issue by the actions {{of a small group of}} our MPs led by the Rt. Hon. Kadaga, I can see the fallacy of Bishop Muhanguzi's position. ... Do Albinos create themselves? No. Simply, nature goes wrong in a minority of cases. ... The question at the core of the debate of the homosexuals is: [...] "What do we do with an abnormal person? Do we kill him/her? Do we imprison him/her? Or do we contain him/her?" ... Apart from the people who are born abnormal, it seems there is a larger group of those that become homosexual for mercenary reasons - they get recruited on account of financial inducements. ... How about the women lesbians? Apart from the ones who are born abnormal and the ones that may become lesbian for mercenary reasons, there may be those that go into that practice because of sexual starvation when they fail to get married. Women are normally more [...] than men.... In the past, this imbalance could have been addressed by polygamy. ... The groups that can be rescued ... are those who are homosexual or lesbian for mercenary reasons or on account of ... failure to get legal partners. The rescue for these mercenary deviants is, first and foremost, economic - rapidly industrialize Uganda, modernize agriculture, etc. ... In addition ... we should legislate harshly against those people with money, from within and without, who take advantange of the desperation of our youth to lure them into these abnormal and deviant behaviors. I would support a life sentence.... On this one <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> with the Bill passed by Parliament. The unanswered question, however, is: What do you do with the really abnormal people? ... Only the other day, I saw on television that Dr. Allan Turing, the genius mathematician that cracked the German Enigma code for the anti-Hitler alliance ... was a homosexual. This man ... enabled them to win the war. Yet, the British chemically castrated him in 1952, where-upon he committed suicide, apparently. Were the British correct in handling that issue like that? The British no longer think so. Only the other day, the Queen had to apologize to this ... person ... much more useful to society than the millions of sexually normal people. ... he challenge is how to correctly handle the sexually abnormal on the one hand and those who use money or any other influence to recruit sexually normal people into this abnormal and disgusting behaviour. When we meet in the NRM caucus, we shall, I am sure, find a scientifically correct position.|$|E
5000|$|Fiori {{explained}} in an interview: [...] "One day in Corsica, when I went to Bastia, Jean-Jacques Goldman {{asked me if}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> possibly <b>agree</b> to sing with him. Then, in the Restonica, we met a young girl absolutely unknown named Christine, {{and the idea of}} a trio became imperative." [...] He also noted that the song is sad.|$|R

6000|$|... "Agree! No! It's {{the most}} absurd {{proposal}} that was ever made. You {{might as well}} ask me whether <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> that you should go to heaven. Go to heaven if you can, I should say. I have not the slightest objection. But it's nothing to me." ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{not long}} after our former discourse, when he {{repeated}} what he had insinuated before, namely, that he had yet a design to lay before me, which, if <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> to his proposals, would more than balance all accounts between us. I told him I could not reasonably deny him anything; and except one thing, which I hoped and believed he would not think of, I should think myself very ungrateful if I did not do everything for him that lay in my power.|$|E
60|$|I smiled, {{and told}} him he and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> upon that; for he did not yet know what favours I had to ask of him, and what expense I should put him to; that I had a great design in my view, which I was to crave his {{assistance}} in, and which I had not yet communicated to him, in which he might perhaps find that he would pay dear enough for all the little presents I had made him; and, in the meantime, to make himself easy as to the three negro men, I gave him my word that he should pay for them, only not yet.|$|E
60|$|Our next {{consideration}} was to {{get away}} from this cursed place, and whither to go. When my opinion came to be asked, I told them I would leave that all to them, and I told them I had rather they would let me go into the woods to get them some provisions, than consult with me, for <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> to whatever they did; but they would not agree to that, for they would not consent that any of us should go into the woods alone; for though we had yet seen no lions or tigers in the woods, we were assured there were many in the island, besides other creatures as dangerous, and perhaps worse, as we afterwards found by our own experience.|$|E
6000|$|Elizabeth-Jane {{thought and}} thought of these words [...] "kept me alive," [...] as they slowly retraced {{their way to the}} town, and at length guessed their meaning.

6000|$|Not long ago, when Mr. Beam took {{occasion}} {{to tell me}} that he [...] loved me and asked me to marry him,--I remember now that it [...] was on the very day that Mr. Petter's horse behaved so badly [...] and, unfortunately for you, tipped you out of the tail end [...] of the little cart, and made it necessary for you to give up [...] both it and Mr. Tippengray to me,--he (Mr. Beam) was so good [...] as to say that if <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> to be his wife and still [...] wished the instructive companionship of Mr. Tippengray, he [...] would take that gentleman into his family as a tutor. Now [...] this, as you will readily acknowledge, my dear Miss Rose, [...] was very good in Mr. Beam, and in return I wish you to say [...] to him, both from Mr. Tippengray and from me, that if there [...] should ever be any position in our gift which he is capable [...] of filling, {{all he has to do}} is to ask for it.|$|E
60|$|This is the arresting and {{dominant}} {{fact about}} modern social discussion; that the quarrel {{is not merely}} about the difficulties, but about the aim. We agree about the evil; {{it is about the}} good that we should tear each other's eyes out. We all admit that a lazy aristocracy is a bad thing. We should not by any means all admit that an active aristocracy would be a good thing. We all feel angry with an irreligious priesthood; but some of us would go mad with disgust at a really religious one. Everyone is indignant if our army is weak, including the people who would be even more indignant if it were strong. The social case is exactly the opposite of the medical case. We do not disagree, like doctors, about the precise nature of the illness, while agreeing about the nature of health. On the contrary, we all agree that England is unhealthy, but half of us would not look at her in what the other half would call blooming health. Public abuses are so prominent and pestilent that they sweep all generous people into a sort of fictitious unanimity. We forget that, while we agree about the abuses of things, we should differ very much about the uses of them. Mr. Cadbury and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>agree</b> about the bad public house. It would be precisely in front of the good public-house that our painful personal fracas would occur.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2005, Santorum {{expressed}} {{misgivings about}} the death penalty in light of wrongly convicted individuals who were sentenced to death. He went on to say, [...] "I agree with the Pope that in the civilized world ... the application of the death penalty should be limited. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> definitely <b>agree</b> with that. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> certainly suggest there probably should be some further limits on what we use it for."
