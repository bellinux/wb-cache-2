For decades, there has been significant disagreement between traditionalists and innovators regarding which ingredients should {{and should not be}} included in a salade niçoise. According to traditionalists, it excludes cooked vegetables. The salad may include raw red peppers, shallots, artichoke hearts and other seasonal raw vegetables. Raw green beans harvested in the spring, when they are still young and crisp, may be included. However, cooked <b>green</b> <b>beans</b> <b>and</b> potatoes are commonly served in variations of salade niçoise that are popular around the world.|$|E

40|$|Growth and Yield of Same Crop by Cropping System and Fertilization of N, P, K in in Tsunami Affected LandABSTRACT. The aim {{of study}} is know {{the effect of}} some {{cropping}} system and N, P, K fertilizer {{as well as the}} interaction of both factors to improve growth <b>and</b> yield maize, <b>green</b> <b>bean,</b> <b>and</b> groundnut. The experimental design was Completely Block Randomized Design with two factors and two replications. The first factor was cropping system: Those were maize monoculture, <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> monoculture, groundnut monoculture, maize-green <b>bean</b> intercropping, <b>and</b> maize-ground nut intercropping. Then the second factor was level of N, P, K fertilizer: Those were control, low dose (90 kg ha- 1 N, 35 kg ha- 1 P 2 O 5, 20 kg ha- 1 K 2 O) and high dose (180 kg ha- 1 N, 70 kg ha- 1 P 2 O 5, 40 kg ha- 1 K 2 O). The observation was done for growth and production of maize, <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> ground nut. The research result showed that, cropping system did not have significant different on the height of maize plant at 15, 30, and 45 days after planting (DAP). Application of fertilizer had significant different on maize plant at 30 and 45 DAP and did not have significant different of maize plant at 15 DAP. Furthermore, cropping system and fertilizer application did not have significant different on the height of <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> groundnut at 15 DAP, but cropping system and fertilizer application have very significant different on height of <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> groundnut at 30 and 45 DAP, as well as interaction between cropping system and application fertilizer on height of <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> groundnut at 30 and 45 DAP. Furthermore, cropping system did not have significant different on cornhusk-maize yield, and application of fertilizer have very significant different on cornhusk-maize yield. Cropping system and application of fertilizer have significant different on yield <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> groundnut as well as interaction between cropping system and application of fertilizer on yield <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> groundnut...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{sun drying}} {{characteristics}} of <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> okra were investigated. Drying experiments {{were conducted in}} Iskenderun-Hatay, Turkey. The drying study showed that the times taken for drying of <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> okra from the initial moisture contents of 89. 5 % and 88. 7 % (w. b.) to final moisture content of around 15 ± 0. 5 % (w. b.) were 60 and 100 h in open sun drying, respectively. The constant rate period is absent in drying curves. The drying process {{took place in the}} falling rate period. The drying data were fitted to thirteen thin-layer drying models. The performance of these models was investigated by comparing the determination of coefficient (R 2), reduced chi-square ( 2) and root mean square error (RMSE) between the observed and predicted moisture ratios.

25|$|Breakfast usually {{consists}} of pancakes, cereal, fruit, and coffee, while lunch {{may take the}} form of a smörgåsbord. The main meal of the day for most Icelanders is dinner, which usually involves fish or lamb as the main course. Seafood is central to most Icelandic cooking, particularly cod and haddock but also salmon, herring, and halibut. It is often prepared in a wide variety of ways, either smoked, pickled, boiled, or dried. Lamb is by far the most common meat, and it tends to be either smoke-cured (known as hangikjöt) or salt-preserved (saltkjöt). Many older dishes make use of every part of the sheep, such as slátur, which {{consists of}} offal (internal organs and entrails) minced together with blood and served in sheep stomach.

500|$|The Solomon Islands skink is {{represented}} in {{both public and private}} collections. [...] The Philadelphia Zoo has bred these skinks over multiple generations for the past 40 years. [...] The keeping of the Solomon Islands skink in captivity is not without its challenges: as it is a large arboreal tropical animal. [...] It requires a large arboreal enclosure, with [...] a constant temperature between 75-80 degrees Fahrenheit, with heat being provided from above as well as below, allowing the skink to bask in the heat from above as it would during dusk, while providing a radiant heat from below to aid digestion. [...] The dynamics of the skink's circulus means that not all groups do well when new animals are introduced. [...] Despite successful breeding programs, their somewhat unusual nature of single births and slow growth has made these programs challenging. [...] A well-cared for monkey-tailed skink can live twenty-five to thirty years. [...] A well-balanced diet consisting primarily [...] of kale, <b>green</b> <b>beans,</b> <b>and</b> cooked sweet potato, supplemented with slices of peeled kiwi fruit, apple, and papaya, as well as access to a large shallow, clean water source aid in increasing longevity. [...] Bathing them in shallow lukewarm water during the beginning of the monthly shed, greatly reduces the stress inherent in shedding, as well as speeds the process.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobium bacteria effects on leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentration and root characteristics of <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> maize under intercropping, experiment {{was carried out}} in the research field of College of Agriculture, Payame Noor University of Azna, Lorestan, Iran. In experiment, sandy loam soil with pH 7. 3 and EC 0. 49 dS m - 1 was used. The treatments comprised three cropping systems (sole cropping of <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> <b>and</b> maize, and intercropping), and four inoculations (control, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, rhizobium and mix of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobium). The results showed that inoculation with rhizobium improved length, diameter, volume <b>and</b> area of <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> root. The highest of <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> N, P concentration and root dry mass were observed in sole culture of <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Moreover, root length, diameter, volume and area of maize increased by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and total concentration of N and P enhanced with use of rhizobium in sole cropping. Although the usage of Rhizobium and AMF can be affected on increasing the root growth and nutrient uptake of crops, application of bacterium and fungi combination at the same time would not be suitable. Overall, intercropping of maize with <b>green</b> <b>bean</b> caused to increase of leaf N and P concentrations and root growth of maize. </p...|$|R
