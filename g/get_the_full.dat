25|$|Each team plays {{each other}} team twice, once {{at home and}} once away making a total of 26 matches. Games start out as 50 over matches but if rain affects play they {{can be reduced to}} a minimum of 20 overs. The method for working out reduced targets is to take 3/4 of the first innings run rate off the first innings score for every over that is lost in the second innings. One over is lost for every 7 minutes in the first innings and every 3½ minutes in the second innings. The second innings can be less than 20 overs as long as there were more than 20 overs bowled in the first innings and the team batting second believe they can chase the full total posted in the first innings or the team bowling second believe they can bowl their opponents out in the {{allocated}} overs. If the team batting second <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> total then they win. If the team bowling second bowl out the team batting second then they win. If neither team does this then it is a No Result. For example, Lowerhouse scored 124–7 off their allocated 31 overs. Nelson opted to chase 125 for victory off 12 overs. They ended up on 82–7 so neither team won and it was a no result. 10 points are awarded for a win, 7 points for a tie, 3 points for a no result and 2 points for bowling the opposition out. Up to 5 bonus points are then awarded to the team who lost. If the team that lost bowled second they get 1-point for 5 wickets, 2 for 6 wickets, 3 for 7 wickets, 4 for 8 wickets and 5 for 9 wickets. If they batted second they get 1-point for being within 50 runs, 2 points for being within 40 runs, 3 points for being within 30 runs, 4 points for being within 20 runs and 5 points for being within 10 runs. 1 point is deducted for slow over rate in an innings of more than 40 overs. One over is expected to be bowled in 3¾ minutes. One bowler may bowl up to 17 overs while no other bowlers may bowl more than 14 overs.|$|E

Becky Cunningham of GamesRadar {{was fascinated by the}} game's setting and the questions it posed about morality and memory, finding the story worth experiencing. Alexa Ray Corriea, writing for GameSpot, generally enjoyed the story despite noting the main plot becoming complicated quickly, but stated that the ending introduced too many new story elements for comfort. Michael Damiani of GameTrailers found the overall story enjoyable, but gaps in story and character development, along with the need to replay the game to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> story, [...] " [...] you full of questions and doubt from beginning to end." [...] Eurogamer's Chris Schilling was similarly critical of the need to understand terms unfamiliar to series newcomers. He also disliked the length of cutscenes, and the jarring change from grim imagery to lighter subjects like chocobo breeding. Tom Sykes of Official Xbox Magazine said that the setting and story's superficial similarities to the later Harry Potter books improved the story after the confusing opening. Game Informers Matt Miller stated that the story started strongly, but was made less enjoyable when it began focusing on the game's overarching narrative and said the abundance of characters had a negative impact on their characterization. RPGFan's Stephen Meyerink, despite saying the game had [...] "goofy faces and silly moments", found the story and themes engaging. Samuel Roberts of PC Gamer was less positive, feeling that the story and characters reminded him too much of poor-quality anime series.|$|E
500|$|The one reel drama, {{approximately}} 1000 feet long, {{was released}} on July 26, 1910. The release of the film fell on the same date of Vitagraph's Uncle Tom's Cabin. Vitagraph had previously released multi-reel works, but a three reel drama was considered a bold innovation by The New York Dramatic Mirror. The Mirror article stated the multi-reel release was risky because Pathé's two reel adaptation of Drink was not followed by other two reel releases. The sudden competition prompted Thanhouser to advertise against Vitagraph's production in The Moving Picture World by declaring the three reel film as being overly drawn out and that audiences could <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>full</b> story in a single reel from Thanhouser. Edward Wagenknecht, author of The Movies in the Age of Innocence, refers to Thanhouser advertising against a two reel version with, [...] "You can see {{the whole thing in}} one reel - why buy two?" [...] This is actually an erroneous reference to the three reel Vitagraph version by Edwin Thanhouser that was published in The Moving Picture World on March 10, 1917. [...] H. Philip Bolton, author of Women Writers Dramatized: A Calendar of Performances from Narrative Works Published in English to 1900, would identify the Thanhouser and Vitagraph release, but is unable to identify and attribute the directorial and casting credits to the productions. A third 1910 adaptation, also named Uncle Tom's Cabin, release by Pathé is cited in The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film. According to Bowers, most Thanhouser posters of this era were of one-sheet size, but an additional six-sheet format poster was created for Uncle Tom's Cabin. The film likely had a wide national release, but specific identification of the Thanhouser film is muddied by the prevalence of Vitagraph's production and stage plays. Two advertisements in Indiana and Kansas specifically note that the film to be shown will be the Thanhouser production.|$|E
