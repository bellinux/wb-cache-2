5|$|Battle of Kamdesh, a 2009 battle 20 {{miles from}} Wanat, the bloodiest battle for U.S. forces since the Battle of Wanat. An assault by 300 Taliban fighters {{resulted}} in eight Americans killed and 22 wounded, and prompt withdrawal <b>from</b> <b>nearly</b> destroyed base.|$|E
5|$|A {{fluxgate}} gradiometer {{survey in}} July 2009 investigated standing stones {{in the garden}} of the Druids Arms public house known as The Cove, which showed that the stones date <b>from</b> <b>nearly</b> a thousand years before the stone circles. The conclusion from the study was that these upright stones are likely to have been the portals or façade of a chambered tomb.|$|E
5|$|September 3–8, 1915 – A Category 3 {{hurricane}} meanders {{around the}} islands for several days, {{during which time}} gale-force winds blow <b>from</b> <b>nearly</b> all directions. Heavy rains cause many roofs to leak, and overall damage is extensive. Enormous waves from the hurricane wreck many boats; one cargo ship in particular, the SS Pollockshields, is driven aground on a reef off Elbow Beach. The captain drowns while attempting to procure a life jacket for a crew member, but all other men are eventually rescued.|$|E

5|$|The {{concentration}} of magnesium {{in the waters}} of Buffalo Creek ranges <b>from</b> <b>nearly</b> 0 to almost 15 milligrams per liter. The concentration is close to 0 for the first third of the creek's course, but then rises to two or three milligrams per liter. The magnesium concentration reaches its peak around halfway between the source and the mouth, then steadily declines to slightly under ten milligrams per liter at the mouth. However, one of Buffalo Creek's tributaries has a magnesium {{concentration of}} nearly 35 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{announced}} in summer of 1984, but was delayed several times for over a year. Before its announcement, Swords and Sorcery had been in development <b>from</b> <b>nearly</b> two years prior to 1985. PSS explained the delays as due to game's complexity that required a lot programming man-hours. The game was PSS's biggest launch to date. Upon release, Swords and Sorcery came with t-shirts, badges and posters.|$|E

The non-sex chromosomes (autosomes) are mostly acrocentric, having a long and a short arm, or telocentric, having only one arm, but there are also three large metacentric pairs, which have two major arms, and a small metacentric pair. The Y chromosome is metacentric and the X chromosome is variable, ranging <b>from</b> <b>nearly</b> metacentric to acrocentric in five specimens studied.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the American and Philippines governments officially {{recognized}} some of {{the units}} and individuals who had fought against the Japanese, which led to benefits for the veterans but not all claims were upheld.

These beneficiaries are only available to the guerrillas and veterans who have served for the Commonwealth, and doesn't include the brigand groups of the Huks and the Moros.

5|$|As Vandygriff and his {{men began}} pulling back from the mountain, North Korean fire was falling in the platoon area <b>from</b> <b>nearly</b> all directions. The squad leaders started {{to break up the}} weapons that the platoon could not take out with them. At this time they {{discovered}} Brown was dead. Vandygriff told his troops not to remove the identification tags from the dead they would be leaving behind, as the tags would be the only means of identification later. Vandygriff put his platoon in a V formation and led them off the hill by the same trail they had ascended, picking up four wounded men on the way down.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2003, Craig Venter, {{leader of}} the privately funded {{parallel}} of the Human Genome Project, has led the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition (GOS), circumnavigating the globe and collecting metagenomic samples throughout the journey. All of these samples are sequenced using shotgun sequencing, in hopes that new genomes (and therefore new organisms) would be identified. The pilot project, conducted in the Sargasso Sea, found DNA <b>from</b> <b>nearly</b> 2000 different species, including 148 types of bacteria never before seen. Venter has circumnavigated the globe and thoroughly explored the West Coast of the United States, and completed a two-year expedition to explore the Baltic, Mediterranean and Black Seas. Analysis of the metagenomic data collected during this journey revealed two groups of organisms, one composed of taxa adapted to environmental conditions of 'feast or famine', and a second composed of relatively fewer but more abundantly and widely distributed taxa primarily composed of plankton.|$|E
5|$|By 1857 the Perpetual Emigration Fund was exhausted; {{almost all}} of the {{handcart}} emigrants that year and in subsequent years had to pay their own way. With the increased cost, the number of handcart emigrants dropped <b>from</b> <b>nearly</b> 2,000 in 1856 to about 480 in 1857. Nevertheless, in 1857 two companies made the trek, both arriving in Salt Lake City by September 13. Perhaps the most notable incident was when a captain of the U.S. Army's Utah Expedition, on its way to Utah to confront Young and the Mormons, donated an ox to the hungry emigrants.|$|E

5|$|Finally, {{with the}} end of the two mathematicians' cryptologic work at the close of World War II, the Cipher Bureau ceased to exist. <b>From</b> <b>nearly</b> its {{inception}} in 1931 until war's end in 1945, the Bureau, sometimes incorporated into aggregates under cryptonyms (PC Bruno and Cadix), had been essentially the same agency, with most of the same core personnel, carrying out much the same tasks; now it was extinguished. Neither Rejewski nor Zygalski would work again as cryptologists. In late 1946 Rejewski returned to his family in a devastated and politically altered Poland, to live there another 33 years until his death in February 1980. Zygalski would remain in England until his death in August 1978.|$|E
5|$|He {{was elected}} the 33rd {{governor}} of Oregon in 1986, serving a single term. He faced significant challenges, particularly a rising anti-tax movement (leading to Measure 5 in 1990) and {{a doubling of}} the state's prison population. He worked across party lines to reduce regulation and to repair the state's infrastructure. During his term, Oregon emerged <b>from</b> <b>nearly</b> eight years of recession. His reforms to the State Accident Insurance Fund (SAIF), a state-chartered worker's compensation insurance company were heralded at the time, but drew strong criticism in later years.|$|E
5|$|On May 21–22, 1893, a Congress {{was held}} in Palermo {{attended}} by 500 delegates <b>from</b> <b>nearly</b> 90 leagues and socialist circles.

5|$|Radyr Weir {{was built}} in 1774 to divert water into a leat to the Melingriffith Tin Plate Works. The weir is the third {{obstacle}} to migratory salmon and sea trout — the others being Llandaff Weir and Blackweir, both of which also have fish passes. Since the early 1980s, the salmon and sea trout stocks in the Taff have been recovering <b>from</b> <b>nearly</b> 200 years of industrial pollution and exploitation. In 1993 the National Rivers Authority monitored over 500 salmon and 700 sea trout returning to the river to spawn.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{measurements}} of Vega at 193μm showed a lower than expected flux for the hypothesized particles, {{suggesting that they}} must instead be {{on the order of}} 100μm or less. To maintain this amount of dust in orbit around Vega, a continual source of replenishment would be required. A proposed mechanism for maintaining the dust was a disk of coalesced bodies that {{were in the process of}} collapsing to form a planet. Models fitted to the dust distribution around Vega indicate that it is a 120AU-radius circular disk viewed <b>from</b> <b>nearly</b> pole-on. In addition, there is a hole in the center of the disk with a radius of no less than 80AU.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{began with}} a major air strike involving more than 200 aircraft against three airbases, Hawk SAM batteries, three command centers, artillery positions and several radar stations, employing MiG-21s, MiG-17s, and Su-7s. This was in concert with artillery strikes starting at 14:05 <b>from</b> <b>nearly</b> 2,000 pieces against the Bar-Lev line, and against armor concentration areas and artillery positions, using field guns, howitzers, mortars, tank guns, B-10 and B-11 recoilless rifles. The self-propelled 152 mm howitzers and 130 mm field guns were assigned counter-battery fire missions against Israeli artillery. The 53-minute-long fire preparation, {{one of the largest}} in history, was divided into four barrages. The first, fifteen minutes long, was aimed at enemy targets on the eastern bank up to a depth of 1.5kilometers. An estimated 10,500 shells were fired against Israeli targets in the first minute alone.|$|E
