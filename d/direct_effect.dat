This query is often rephrased as: Does X have a <b>direct</b> causal <b>effect</b> on Y not through M? <b>Direct</b> <b>effects</b> have been formally defined in three different ways: the controlled <b>direct</b> <b>effects</b> (CDE), the natural <b>direct</b> <b>effects</b> (i. e. pure and total direct effects- PDE and TDE), and the principal stratum <b>direct</b> <b>effects</b> (PSDE).

5|$|Thomas Paine's {{pamphlet}} Common Sense {{was published}} in January 1776, just as it became clear in the colonies that the king was not inclined {{to act as a}} conciliator. Paine had only recently arrived in the colonies from England, and he argued in favor of colonial independence, advocating republicanism as an alternative to monarchy and hereditary rule. Common Sense introduced no new ideas and probably had little <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> on Congress's thinking about independence; its importance was in stimulating public debate on a topic that few had previously dared to openly discuss. Public support for separation from Great Britain steadily increased after the publication of Paine's enormously popular pamphlet.|$|E
5|$|The Second Symphony, and Livre pour orchestre and the Cello Concerto which followed, were {{composed}} during a particularly traumatic period in Lutosławski's life. His {{mother died in}} 1967, and in 1967–70 {{there was a great}} deal of unrest in Poland. This sprang first from the suppression of the theatre production Dziady, which sparked a summer of protests; later, in 1968, the use of Polish troops to suppress the liberal reforms in Czechoslovakia's Prague Spring, and the Gdańsk Shipyards strike of 1970—which led to a violent clampdown by the authorities, both caused significant political and social tension in Poland. Lutosławski did not support the Soviet regime, and these events have been postulated as reasons for the increase in antagonistic effects in his work, particularly the Cello Concerto of 1968–70 for Rostropovich and the Royal Philharmonic Society. Indeed, Rostropovich's own opposition to the Soviet regime in Russia was just coming to a head (he shortly afterwards declared his support for the dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn). Lutosławski himself did not hold the view that such influences had a <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> on his music, although he acknowledged that they impinged on his creative world to some degree. In any case, the Cello Concerto was a great success, earning both Lutosławski and Rostropovich accolades. At the work's première with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, Arthur Bliss presented Rostropovich with the Royal Philharmonic Society's gold medal.|$|E

5|$|The {{prospect}} of developing such large tourist accommodations has encountered concerns from both APSARA and the ICC, claiming that previous tourism {{developments in the}} area have neglected construction regulations and more of these projects {{have the potential to}} damage landscape features. Also, the large scale of these projects have begun to threaten the quality of the nearby town's water, sewage, and electricity systems. It has been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand for quality accommodations in the area, such as the development of a large highway, has had a <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> on the underground water table, subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at Angkor Wat. Locals of Siem Reap have also voiced concern that the charm and atmosphere of their town have been compromised in order to entertain tourism. Since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like Angkor Tourist City, the local officials continue to discuss how to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{any other}} element, helium will remain liquid down to {{absolute}} zero at normal pressures. This is a <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> of quantum mechanics: specifically, {{the zero point}} energy {{of the system is}} too high to allow freezing. Solid helium requires a temperature of 1–1.5K (about −272°C or −457°F) at about 25 bar (2.5MPa) of pressure. It is often hard to distinguish solid from liquid helium since the refractive index of the two phases are nearly the same. The solid has a sharp melting point and has a crystalline structure, but it is highly compressible; applying pressure in a laboratory can decrease its volume by more than 30%. With a bulk modulus of about 27 MPa it is ~100 times more compressible than water. Solid helium has a density of 0.214±0.006g/cm3 at 1.15K and 66atm; the projected density at 0K and 25 bar (2.5 MPa) is 0.187±0.009g/cm3. At higher temperatures, helium will solidify with sufficient pressure. At room temperature, this requires about 114,000 atm.|$|E

25|$|Over time ECJ {{developed}} two essential {{rules on}} which the legal order rests: <b>direct</b> <b>effect</b> and primacy.

Three WRF-Chem model simulations were performed for the forest fire case for a baseline without any aerosol feedback on meteorology, a simulation with aerosol <b>direct</b> <b>effects</b> only and a simulation including both <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>effects.</b> For the dust case study, eight WRF-Chem and one WRF-CMAQ simulations were selected from the set of simulations conducted in the framework of AQMEII. Of these two simulations considered no feedbacks, two included <b>direct</b> <b>effects</b> only and five simulations included both <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>effects.</b> The results from both episodes demonstrate that it is important to include the meteorology and chemistry interactions in online-coupled models. Model evaluations using routine observations collected in AQMEII phase- 2 and observations from a station in Moscow show that for the fire case the simulation including only aerosol <b>direct</b> <b>effects</b> has better performance than the simulations with no aerosol feedbacks or including both <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>effects.</b> The normalized mean biases are significantly reduced by 10 – 20 % for PM 10 when including aerosol <b>direct</b> <b>effects.</b> The analysis for the dust case confirms that models perform better when including aerosol <b>direct</b> <b>effects,</b> but worse when including both aerosol <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>effects,</b> which suggests that the representation of aerosol indirect effects needs to be improved in the model...|$|R
