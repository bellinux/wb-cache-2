Together {{the formations of}} the Grand Staircase record nearly 2000 million years of the Earth's history. Bryce Canyon's formations are the youngest known units in the Grand Staircase. Younger rock units, if they <b>ever</b> <b>existed,</b> have been removed by erosion.|$|E
5|$|Along with Democrats John Stuart Williams, William Lindsay, and J. Proctor Knott, and Republican Robert Boyd, McCreary was {{nominated}} for a U.S. Senate seat in 1878. Democrats were divided by sectionalism and initially unable to unite behind one of their four candidates. After more than a week of caucusing among Democratic legislators, the nominations of McCreary, Knott, and Lindsay were withdrawn, and Williams was elected over Boyd. Historian Hambleton Tapp opined that the withdrawals were likely a part of some kind of deal among legislators, although the details of the deal, if it <b>ever</b> <b>existed,</b> were not made public.|$|E
5|$|Scientists will {{probably}} never be certain {{of the largest and}} smallest dinosaurs to have <b>ever</b> <b>existed.</b> This is because only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork.|$|E
50|$|One {{objection}} is {{that the}} possibility of your existing at all depends on how many humans will <b>ever</b> <b>exist</b> (N).

5|$|The family records, many {{of which}} were {{translated}} and published in the , reveal the personality of the man who figures prominently in the history of colonization as the founder of the only successful patroonship that <b>ever</b> <b>existed</b> in New Netherland. But beyond the fact that he managed this patroonship and that he was a merchant and director of the West India Company, practically nothing was known until the organization and translation of the family records in the early 1900s (decade).|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} a diverse and complex {{geologic}} history. Since its formation, {{the area that}} comprises the park has experienced at least four major periods of extensive volcanism, three or four periods of major sedimentation, and several intervals of major tectonic deformation where the crust has been reshaped. Two periods of glaciation (a series of ice ages) have also had effects on the area, although no glaciers <b>ever</b> <b>existed</b> in the ranges now in the park.|$|E
5|$|All {{medical records}} and documents, {{including}} Poe's death certificate, have been lost, if they <b>ever</b> <b>existed.</b> The precise cause of Poe's death is disputed, but many theories exist. Many biographers {{have addressed the}} issue and reached different conclusions, ranging from Jeffrey Meyers' assertion that it was hypoglycemia to John Evangelist Walsh's conspiratorial murder plot theory. It has also been suggested that Poe's death might have resulted from suicide related to depression. In 1848, he nearly died from an overdose of laudanum, readily available as a tranquilizer and pain killer. Though it is unclear {{if this was a}} true suicide attempt or just a miscalculation on Poe's part, it did not lead to Poe's death a year later.|$|E

5|$|And so matters stood {{until the}} massive PAVN/NLF Tet Offensive of early 1968. Although a {{tactical}} victory for American and South Vietnamese forces, Tet became a political disaster. The American public (who had been reassured by President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Pentagon that the communists were incapable of launching any such actions) were {{stunned by the}} size and ferocity of the offensive. The {{light at the end}} of the tunnel had been extinguished, if it had <b>ever</b> <b>existed</b> at all. The president, in an attempt to nudge Hanoi to the negotiating table, decreed an end to bombing operations in North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel, effectively ending Rolling Thunder on 11 November 1968.|$|E
5|$|Morrow {{opened his}} {{practice}} in Lexington. He established his reputation {{in one of}} his first casesthe trial of William Moseby, a black man accused of murder. Moseby's first trial had ended in a hung jury, but because the evidence against him included a confession (which he later recanted), most observers believed he would be convicted in his second trial. Unable to find a defense lawyer for Moseby, the judge in the case turned to Morrow, who as a young lawyer was eager for work. Morrow proved that his client's testimony had been extorted; he had been told that a lynch mob waited outside the jail for him, but no such mob had <b>ever</b> <b>existed.</b> Morrow further showed that other testimony against his client was false. Moseby was acquitted September 21, 1902.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent erosion lasting 300million years {{stripped}} much of {{the exposed}} sediments and the mountains away. This reduced the very high mountains to small hills a few tens to hundreds of feet (tens of meters) high. Geologist John Wesley Powell called this major gap in the geologic record, which is also seen {{in other parts of}} the world, the Great Unconformity. Other sediments may have been added but, if they <b>ever</b> <b>existed,</b> were completely removed by erosion. Such gaps in the geologic record are called unconformities by geologists. The Great Unconformity is one of the best examples of an exposed nonconformity, which is a type of unconformity that has bedded rock units above igneous or metamorphic rocks.|$|E

5|$|The Altoona & Wopsononock {{initially}} owned two engines. #1 was a National 2-6-0, and #2 a Baldwin 4-4-0, both {{of which}} were purchased used from the Pittsburgh and Western Railroad. In 1892, the Altoona, Clearfield & Northern bought #3, a Baldwin 4-6-0. However, due to the depleted state of the railroad's finances, it was unable to pay for #3. Samuel Langdon forestalled legal proceedings by having the locomotive transferred to his United Collieries Co., which paid Baldwin in coal. Nothing is known of #4, if it <b>ever</b> <b>existed.</b> The Altoona & Beech Creek bought #5 and #6, both Baldwin 2-6-0s, in 1901, while still under Pittsburg, Johnstown, Ebensburg & Eastern control. After the PJE lost its lease on the railroad, litigation ensued over the ownership of #3; by the time the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania declared in favor of the A in 1903, United Collieries had sold it to the Surry, Sussex and Southampton Railroad. #5 and #6 were sold to the Ohio River and Western Railroad and the Tacajo Sugar Company, respectively, when the railroad was converted to standard gauge in 1916.|$|E
5|$|The story {{continues}} {{with the arrival}} of several more Christian princes and their armies. Radiaro and Calafia issue a challenge to two Christian warriors to engage them in single combat for the purpose of deciding the battle. King Amadis and his son Esplandi치n accept the challenge. The black-skinned warrior woman chosen as messenger tells Calafia that Esplandi치n is the most handsome and elegant man that has <b>ever</b> <b>existed.</b> Calafia determines that she must see the man herself before engaging him in combat. She stays awake all night wondering whether to wear royal robes or warrior's armor. Deciding in favor of a thick golden toga embroidered with jewels, topped by a golden hood, she rode to meet her enemies, escorted by 2,000 women warriors. After being seated among the Christian kings, she immediately recognized Esplandi치n from his great beauty, {{and fell in love with}} him. She tells him she will meet him on the field of battle and, if they should live, that she wishes to speak further with him. Esplandi치n considers Calafia an infidel, an abomination of the rightfully subservient position of woman in relation to man, and he makes no response.|$|E
5|$|Vidya goes to meet Damji, {{followed}} by Rana and Khan. Damji cuts the meeting short when Vidya expresses her {{doubt that he}} will be able to return her husband in exchange for the sensitive file, and he attempts to leave. Vidya tries to stop him, and in the ensuing struggle Damji draws a gun on her. Vidya disarms him using the prosthetic belly she has been using to fake her pregnancy and promptly stabbing him in the neck with her hair stick, before shooting him with his own gun. She flees into the crowd before the police arrive, leaving a thank you note for Rana and a pen drive containing data from Sridhar's computer, which leads to Bhaskaran's arrest. Rana concludes that no Vidya or Arnab Bagchi <b>ever</b> <b>existed,</b> and that Vidya had been using the police and the IB to achieve her own ends.|$|E
50|$|This {{objection}} to the Doomsday Argument (DA), originally by Dennis Dieks (1992), developed by Bartha & Hitchcock (1999), and expanded by Ken Olum (2001), is {{that the possibility of}} you existing at all depends on how many humans will <b>ever</b> <b>exist</b> (N). If N is big, then the chance of you existing is higher than if only a few humans will <b>ever</b> <b>exist.</b> Since you do indeed exist, this is evidence that N is high. The argument is sometimes expressed in an alternative way by having the posterior marginal distribution of n based on N without explicitly invoking a non-zero chance of existing. The Bayesian inference mathematics are identical.|$|R
50|$|The Doomsday {{argument}} (DA) {{does not}} say that humanity cannot or will not exist indefinitely. It does not put any upper limit {{on the number of}} humans that will <b>ever</b> <b>exist,</b> nor provide a date for when humanity will become extinct.|$|R

5|$|The {{student body}} of Queen's is {{represented}} by two students' unions, the Alma Mater Society (AMS) for all undergraduate students and the Society of Graduate and Professional Students for graduate and professional students. The AMS of Queen's University is the oldest undergraduate student government in Canada. The AMS recognizes more than 200 student clubs and organizations. All accredited extracurricular organizations at Queen's fall {{under the jurisdiction of}} either the AMS, or the Society of Graduate and Professional Students. The organizations and clubs accredited at Queen's cover a wide range of interests including academics, culture, religion, social issues, and recreation. The oldest accredited club at Queen's is the Queen's Debating Union, which was formed in 1843 as the Dialectic Society. The Dialectic Society served as a form of student government, until the AMS was formed from the dialectic society in 1858. The Queen's Bands is a student marching band founded in 1905, which claims to be the largest and oldest student marching band in Canada. Fraternities and sororities have been banned at the university, since a ruling made by the AMS in 1933. The ruling was passed in response to the formation of two fraternities in the 1920s. No accredited sororities have <b>ever</b> <b>existed</b> at Queen's.|$|E
5|$|The trip to Lorraine in 1564 was a {{set back}} for his health but he soon {{recovered}} and embarked on his greatest project yet, a project which would extend far beyond his cartographic interests. The first element was the Chronologia, {{a list of all}} significant events {{since the beginning of the}} world compiled from his literal reading of the bible and no less than 123 other authors of genealogies and histories of every empire that had <b>ever</b> <b>existed.</b> Mercator was the first to link historical dates of solar and lunar eclipses to Julian dates calculated mathematically from his knowledge of the motions of the sun, moon and Earth. He then fixed the dates of other events in Babylonian, Greek, Hebrew and Roman calendars relative to the eclipses that they recorded. The time origin was fixed from the genealogies of the Bible as 3965 years before the birth of Christ. This huge volume (400 pages) was greeted with acclaim by scholars throughout Europe and Mercator himself considered it to be his greatest achievement up to that time. On the other hand, the Catholic Church placed the work on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (List of Prohibited Books) because Mercator included the deeds of Martin Luther. Had he published such a work in Louvain he would again be laying himself open to charges of heresy.|$|E
