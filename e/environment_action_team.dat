The PEAT inspection team {{is made up of}} NHS staff including nurses, doctors and service managers and public and patient representatives.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this study}} is to examine 15 NHS acute trusts in England that {{achieved}} high scores at all their hospitals in the first four national Patient Environment audits. No common external explanations were discernible. This paper seeks to examine whether the facilities managers responsible for the Patient Environment displayed a consistent leadership style. Design/methodology/approach – Overall, six of the 15 trusts gave permission for the research to take place and a series of unstructured interviews and observations were arranged with 22 facilities managers in these trusts. Responses were transcribed and categorised through multiple iteration. Findings – The research found common leadership and managerial behaviours, many of which could be identified from other literature. The research also identified managers deliberately devoting energy and time to creating networks of conversations. This creation of networks through managing conversation is behaviour less evident in mainstream leadership literature or in the current Department of Health and NHS leadership models. Practical implications – The findings of this study offer managers (particularly those in FM and managers across NHS) a unique insight into the potential impact of leaders giving an opportunity to re-model thinking on management and leadership and the related managerial development opportunities. It provides the leverage to move facilities management from the role of a commodity or support service, to a position as a true enabler of business. Originality/value – Original research is presented in a previously under-examined area. The paper illuminates how facilities management within trusts achieving high Patient <b>Environment</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Team</b> (PEAT) scores is led. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} and evaluate the process of implementing an elementary school-based <b>action</b> <b>team</b> dedicated to increasing physical activity and healthy living opportunities for students. To facilitate this intervention, Epstein and colleagues' (2002) partnership framework, coupled with action research principles, was used to create partnerships between the school, home, and community. The results suggest that an <b>action</b> <b>team</b> based on Epstein and colleagues' guidelines may be suitable for creating opportunities for healthy and active living in an elementary school setting. In particular, families, students, teachers, and administration believed that the <b>action</b> <b>team</b> initiatives added to the school environment, school spirit, and value of the family as an essential component in the school. Likewise, the <b>action</b> <b>team</b> members felt that the health and wellness committee they represented was a valued component in the school culture that could be further developed and improved on in future years...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to focus on job‐related skill {{heterogeneity}} and <b>action</b> <b>team</b> performance by considering that team members may differ in the levels of their job‐related skill, as well as in the way their job‐related skill is spread over the different dimensions of the task. Design/methodology/approach Data were used from 30 National Basketball Association (NBA) teams collected over 21 seasons (1986 / 1987 through 2006 / 2007). The total number of team‐seasons analyzed was 584. Findings A positive relationship was found between job‐skill level heterogeneity and <b>action</b> <b>team</b> performance that declines as average job‐skill level in the <b>team</b> grows. Furthermore, <b>action</b> <b>teams</b> showed poorer performance when their members with a low job‐related skill level have a high specialization. Practical implications From the practical perspective, it is of special interest to an <b>action</b> <b>team</b> manager to know that job‐related skill heterogeneity has a positive influence on team performance – mainly when the average job‐related skill level in the team is low – and that highly specialized members may have a negative influence on <b>action</b> <b>team</b> performance. Originality/value The results contribute to the team literature by focusing on <b>action</b> <b>teams.</b> This kind of team has not received attention despite their increasing importance within organizations. Additionally, using sports teams as a sample offers the possibility of gathering a large amount of objective job‐related skill data as well as the possibility of testing hypotheses in a relatively controlled environment, but with real actions instead of experimental actions. </p...|$|R
