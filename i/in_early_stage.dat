5|$|Changes {{in the way}} {{research}} ethics was visualised in {{the wake}} of the Nuremberg Trials (1946), led to an atmosphere of protectionism of groups deemed to be vulnerable that was often legislated or regulated. This resulted in the relative underrepresentation of women in clinical trials. The position of women in research was further compromised in 1977, when in response to the tragedies resulting from thalidomide and diethylstilbestrol (DES), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibited women of child bearing years from participation <b>in</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> clinical trials. In practice this ban was often applied very widely to exclude all women. Women, at least those in the child bearing years, were also deemed unsuitable research subjects due to their fluctuating hormonal levels during the menstrual cycle. However, research has demonstrated significant biological differences between the sexes in rates of susceptibility, symptoms and response to treatment in many major areas of health, including heart disease and some cancers. These exclusions pose a threat to the application of evidence-based medicine to women, and compromise to care offered to both women and men.|$|E

2500|$|Radiation {{therapy is}} {{commonly}} used in prostate cancer treatment. It may be used instead of surgery or after surgery <b>in</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> prostate cancer (adjuvant radiotherapy). Radiation treatments also can be combined with hormonal therapy for intermediate risk disease, when surgery or radiation therapy alone {{is less likely to}} cure the cancer. Some radiation oncologists combine external beam radiation and brachytherapy for intermediate to high-risk situations. Radiation therapy is often used in conjunction with hormone therapy for high-risk patients. Others use a [...] "triple modality" [...] combination of external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, and hormonal therapy. [...] In advanced stages of prostate cancer, radiation is used to treat painful bone metastases or reduce spinal cord compression.|$|E
2500|$|A {{blood test}} for a marker {{molecule}} called CA-125 {{is useful in}} differential diagnosis and in follow up of the disease, but it by itself has not {{been shown to be}} an effective method to screen for early-stage ovarian cancer due to its unacceptable low sensitivity and specificity. CA-125 levels in premenopausal people over 200 U/mL may indicate ovarian cancer, as may any elevation in CA-125 above 35 U/mL in post-menopausal people. CA-125 levels are not accurate <b>in</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> ovarian cancer, as fully half of stage I ovarian cancer patients have a normal CA-125 level. CA-125 may also be elevated in benign (non-cancerous) conditions, including endometriosis, pregnancy, uterine fibroids, menstruation, ovarian cysts, systemic lupus erythematosus, liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, pelvic inflammatory disease, and leiomyoma. [...] HE4 is another candidate for ovarian cancer testing, though it has not been extensively tested. Other tumor markers for ovarian cancer include CA19-9, CA72-4, CA15-3, immunosuppressive acidic protein, haptoglobin-alpha, OVX1, mesothelin, lysophosphatidic acid, osteopontin, and fibroblast growth factor 23.|$|E
2500|$|Some RCTs {{are fully}} or partly {{funded by the}} health care {{industry}} (e.g., the pharmaceutical industry) as opposed to government, nonprofit, or other sources. A systematic review published in 2003 found four 1986-2002 articles comparing industry-sponsored and nonindustry-sponsored RCTs, and in all the articles there was a correlation of industry sponsorship and positive study outcome. A 2004 study of 1999-2001 RCTs published in leading medical and surgical journals determined that industry-funded RCTs [...] "are more likely to be associated with statistically significant pro-industry findings." [...] These results have been mirrored in trials in surgery, where although industry funding did not affect the rate of trial discontinuation it was however associated with a lower odds of publication for completed trials [...] One possible reason for the pro-industry results in industry-funded published RCTs is publication bias. [...] Other authors have cited the differing goals of academic and industry sponsored research as contributing to the difference. Commercial sponsors may be more focused on performing trials of drugs that have already shown promise <b>in</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> trials, and on replicating previous positive results to fulfill regulatory requirements for drug approval.|$|E

2500|$|These {{improvements}} in surgical techniques have allowed many tumours to be resected (removed) [...] by transoral (through the mouth) surgical approaches (TOS), using transoral endoscopic {{head and neck}} surgery (HNS). Consequently surgery became used more, increasing to 35% of cases by 2012. This approach has proven safety, efficacy and tolerability, and includes two main minimally invasive techniques, transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and transoral laser microsurgery (TLM). No direct comparisons of these two techniques have been conducted, and clinical trials in head and neck cancer such as ECOG 3311 allow either. They are associated with substantial postoperative morbidity, depending on extent of resection but compared to older techniques have shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, less pain, and less need for gastrostomy or tracheostomy, and less long term effects, which are minimal {{in the absence of}} postoperative radiation (RT), or chemoradiation (CRT). TORS has the practical advantage that angled telescopes and rotating robotic surgical arms provide better line of sight. Outcomes of minimally invasive procedures also compare favourably with more invasive ones. <b>In</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> disease, including involvement of neck nodes, TORS produces a 2-year survival of 80–90%. TLM similarly, is reported to have a five-year survival of 78% and local control rates of 85–97%. In addition to early disease, minimally invasive surgery has been used in advanced cases, with up to 90% local control and disease specific survival. Postoperative swallowing was excellent in 87%, but long term dysphagia was associated with larger (T4) cancers, especially if involving the base of the tongue.|$|E
