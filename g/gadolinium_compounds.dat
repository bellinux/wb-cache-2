In this article, we demonstrate sensitivity to both high energy gamma-rays and neutrons with a water Cerenkov based detector.

Sensitivity to neutrons is enhanced by the addition of a <b>gadolinium</b> <b>compound</b> to the water in low concentrations.

50|$|The {{gadolinium}} ion, Gd3+, has the f7 electronic configuration, {{with all}} spins parallel. Compounds of the Gd3+ ion {{are the most}} suitable {{for use as a}} contrast agent for MRI scans. The magnetic moments of <b>gadolinium</b> <b>compounds</b> are larger than those of any transition metal ion. Gadolinium ispreferred to other lanthanide ions, some of which have larger effective moments, due to its having a non-degenerate electronic ground state. For many years the nature of oxyhemoglobin, Hb-O2, was highly controversial. It was found experimentally to be diamagnetic. Deoxy-hemoglobin is generally accepted to be a complex of iron in the +2 oxidation state, that is a d6 system with a high-spin magnetic moment near to the spin-only value of 4.9 μB. It was proposed that the iron is oxidized and the oxygen reduced to superoxide.|$|E
50|$|There {{also has}} been {{interest}} in the possible use of gadolinium-157 (157Gd) as a capture agent for NCT for the following reasons: First, and foremost, has been its very high neutron capture cross section of 254,000 barns. Second, <b>gadolinium</b> <b>compounds,</b> such as Gd-DTPA (gadopentetate dimeglumine Magnevist®), have been used routinely as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain tumors and have shown high uptake by brain tumor cells in tissue culture (in vitro). Third, gamma rays and internal conversion and Auger electrons are products of the 157Gd (n,γ)158Gd capture reaction (157Gd + nth (0.025eV) → 158Gd → 158Gd + γ + 7.94 MeV). Although the gamma rays have long pathlengths, orders of magnitude greater depths of penetration compared with the other radiations, the other radiation products (internal conversion and Auger electrons) have pathlengths of approximately one cell diameter and can directly damage DNA. Therefore, it would be highly advantageous {{for the production of}} DNA damage if the 157Gd were localized within the cell nucleus. However, the possibility of incorporating gadolinium into biologically active molecules is very limited and {{only a small number of}} potential delivery agents for Gd NCT have been studied. Relatively few studies with Gd have been carried out in experimental animals compared to the large number with boron containing compounds (Table 1), which have been synthesized and evaluated in experimental animals (in vivo). Although in vitro activity has been demonstrated using the Gd-containing MRI contrast agent Magnevist® as the Gd delivery agent, there are very few studies demonstrating the efficacy of Gd NCT in experimental animal tumor models, and Gd NCT has to date never been used clinically (i.e., in humans).|$|E

40|$|Through the {{introduction}} of newly invented high-performance gradient systems to MRI, which enable for echoplanar imaging (EPI), also magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has gained an entirely new field of applications and techniques. Ultrafast imaging techniques in MRA allow the investigation of larger vascular areas within a single breathhold-period. Artifacts like motion induced signal misregistrations, dephasing or saturation of the vascular signal are minimized by extremely short echo times. The technique thus requires the intravenous application of a contrast media bolus, usually a <b>gadolinium</b> <b>compound,</b> which is in standard clinical use. Coordination of the bolus injection and {{the timing of the}} data acquisition is crucial for optimal results. The first pass evaluation of the contrast media resembles CTA to a certain extend. Due to the fast measurement and the high contrast in contrast-enhanced MRA (CE-MRA) new applications and indications are developed like MRA of the pulmonary vessels. The paper offers considerations and trials for optimization of thoracical CE-MRA. Besides parameter constellation also bolus-optimization is described with respect to the dedicated anatomical premises. Investigations on volunteers and on patients build a basis for suggestions on optimized CE-MRA procedures. To date, a final estimation of the clinical value of the new technique cannot be given since ongoing improvements change the optimal protocol frequently and the potential of further developments is high...|$|R

(For present naming purposes the aqua ligand is treated as distinct from the unligated water, which we call water of hydration.) We describe here the preparation, by wet chemistry means, of the stoichiometric dihydrate, [Gd(Hcitr) (H 20) 2]n· 2 nH 20, whose basic building block in the crystal is a two-dimensional polymer of the complex. The anhydrous form, also a two-dimensional polymer, is preparad from the dihydrate at 77 'C (several hours) in a single-crystal to single-crystal transformation.

40|$|International audience—Plastic {{scintillator}} loading with gadolinium-rich organometallic complexes shows a {{high potential}} for the deployment of efficient and cost-effective neutron detectors. Due to the low-energy photon and electron signature of thermal neutron capture by Gd- 155 and Gd- 157, alternative treatment to pulse-shape discrimination has to be proposed in order to display a count rate.

40|$|The {{thioredoxin}} (Trx) {{system is}} a major antioxidant system integral to maintaining the intracellular redox state. It contains Trx, a redox active protein, which regulates the activity of various enzymes including those that function to counteract oxidative stress within the cell. Trx can also scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) and directly inhibits pro-apoptotic proteins such as apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK 1). The oxidized form of Trx is reduced by thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). The cytoplasm and mitochondria contain equivalent Trx systems and inhibition of either system can lead to activation of apoptotic signaling pathways. There {{are a number of}} inhibitors with chemotherapy applications that target either Trx or TrxR to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is effective against many cancer cells and functions by up-regulating an endogenous inhibitor of Trx.

The europium and terbium containing compounds both exhibit luminescence of the referring trivalent lanthanide ions, giving a red luminescence for Eu 3 + {{and a green}} luminescence for Tb 3 + triggered by an efficient antenna effect of the 4, 4 '-bipyridine linkers. Mixing of different lanthanides in one MOF structure was undertaken to investigate the potential of this MOF system for colour tuning of the luminescence. Based on the <b>gadolinium</b> containing <b>compound,</b> co-doping with different amounts of europium and terbium proves successful and yields solid solutions of the formula 2 ∞[Gd 2 -x-yEuxTbyCl 6 (bipy) 3]* 2 bipy (1 – 8), 0 ≤x, y≤ 0. 5. The series of MOFs exhibits the opportunity of tuning the emission colour in-between green and red. Depending on the atomic ratio Gd:Eu:Tb, the yellow region was covered {{for the first time}} for an oxygen/carboxylate-free MOF system. In addition to a ligand to metal energy transfer (LMET) from the lowest ligand-centered triplet state of 4, 4 '-bipyridine, a metal to metal energy transfer (MMET) between 4 f-levels from Tb 3 + to Eu 3 + is as well vital for the emission colour. However, no involvement of Gd 3 + in energy transfers is observed rendering it a suitable host lattice ion and connectivity centre for diluting the other two rare earth ions in the solid state. The materials retain their luminescence during activation of the MOFs for microporosity. ...|$|R
