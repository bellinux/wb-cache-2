50|$|<b>Drying</b> <b>drum,</b> {{also named}} drum dryer, is a machine for drying process, which people call drum drying. It’s a special kiln that usually co-works with burning system, like coal burner or oil burner. The heat goes through its inner cylinder, {{dehydrating}} the material inside. The materials {{can be added}} in and withdrawn during the drying process, so it can work continuously.|$|E
50|$|Drum drying is {{a method}} used for drying out liquids from raw {{materials}} with <b>drying</b> <b>drum.</b> In the drum-drying process, pureed raw ingredients are dried at relatively low temperatures over rotating, high-capacity drums that produce sheets of drum-dried product. This product is milled to a finished flake or powder form. Modern drum drying techniques results in dried ingredients which reconstitute immediately and retain much of their original flavor, color and nutritional value.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, {{textiles}} were dried outdoors {{with the}} wind and the sun enhancing the drying process. Tumble dryers offer a fast and convenient way of drying textiles independent of weather conditions. Tumble dryers, however, consume large amounts of electrical energy. Over 4 million tumble dryers are sold each year in Europe and a considerable amount of energy is used for drying of clothes. Increasing energy costs and the awareness about environmental problems related to a large energy use has increased the demand for dryers with better energy efficiency. The aim with this thesis is to show how to improve the energy efficiency of domestic tumble dryers. Two types of tumble dryers are available on the market today: the open cycle dryer and the closed cycle dryer. In the open cycle dryer room air is heated and led into the <b>drying</b> <b>drum.</b> The exhaust air leaves the dryer and is often evacuated outside the building. In the closed cycle dryer an internal airflow is recirculated inside the dryer. When the hot air has passed through the <b>drying</b> <b>drum</b> it is led through a heat exchanger where the water vapour is condensed before the air is heated again and led to the drum. The heat exchanger is cooled with room air. Drying at low temperature has been shown to reduce the specific energy use for an open cycle tumble dryer. In Paper I a correlation between the specific energy use, the drying time and the heat supply was established for a specific load by using the exhaust air temperature. It was shown that the total drying time and specific energy use could be predicted from data during the first hour of the process. This result indicated a possibility to create a control system that makes it possible for the user to choose between low energy use or short drying time. The focus of Paper II is to reduce the energy use for a closed cycle tumble dryer. Energy and mass balances were established in order to determine feasible improvements. Energy and mass flows in the dryer indicated that reducing leakage from the internal system of the dryer gave the largest reduction of specific energy use. Insulation of the back cover of the dryer and opening the internal system during the falling drying rate period also gave positive results on the energy use. In total a feasible reduction of the energy use of approximately 17 % was calculated...|$|E
40|$|The short {{drying time}} and low product {{temperature}} makes it suitable for drying such heat-sensitive materials as herbs and vegetables. The {{purpose of this}} work {{was to develop a}} small-scale dryer for herbs and vegetables. A prototype rotary dryer combining infrared radiation with a so-called heat pump drying method was applied in drying experiments for several herbs and vegetables. The drying experiments were performed under actual crop production conditions. The drying curves for leaves of birch (Betula spp.), rosebay willowherb (Epilobium angustifolium) and dandelion (Taraxacum spp.) as well as slices of red beet (Beta vulgaris) and carrot (Daucus carota) are presented. During the drying operation, temperature and humidity of the drying air were recorded, as well as the energy consumed in drying. The quality parameters measured were water content, colour and rehydration ratio. In the present rotary dryer design, intermittent irradiation and mixing of the product enable to avoid overheating, which is particularly important for maintaining product quality. In this dryer design the <b>drying</b> <b>drum</b> slowly rotates and simultaneously mixes the product. The infrared heaters are attached to a panel, allowing the product to receive infrared radiation periodically...|$|E

40|$|The {{sewage sludge}} from {{wastewater}} treatment plant is a potential source of infectious organism. The number and type of pathogens in sludge depends on various factors namely, the wastewater source, the type of treatment plant, and other environmental {{factors such as the}} biological medium offered by the sewage sludge. The principal sludge- borne diseases are presented followed by discussion on biological aspect of growth and occurrence. The overall objective of this work is to estimate kinetic reduction of pathogen population in sludge during different thermal-drying process including: the agitated conductive <b>drying,</b> <b>drum</b> drying, solar drying, and fry-drying. The temperature curves were reported from literature except frying data which were determined in experiment. In order to apply the temperature inﬂuence on pathogens population, kinetic parameters for the thermal inactivation (D, z-values) were chosen from literature. Values of concentrations of each pathogen were also extracted from scientiﬁc review of pathogens in bio-solids. This study conducted to resolve the survival kinetic of Hepatitis A viruses. The result showed that a concentration of 7 × 104 cfu/ 100 ml initially present in the sewage sludge is signiﬁcantly reduced during the heat drying processes except the solar plant. The sewage sludge is completely disinfected when heated for 20 min, 10 min, and 10 s, respectively, during the agitated conductive process, vacuum fry-drying, and drum drying process. ...|$|E
40|$|Paper drying is {{the most}} {{energy-intensive}} and temperature-critical aspect of papermaking. It is estimated that about 67 % of the total energy required in papermaking is used to dry paper. The conventional drying method uses a series of steam-heated metal cylinders that are required to meet ASME codes for pressure vessels, which limits the steam pressure to about 160 psig. Consequently, the shell temperature and the drying capacity are also limited. Gas Technology Institute together with Boise Paper Solutions, Groupe Laparrier and Verreault (GL&V) USA Inc., Flynn Burner Corporation and with funding support from the U. S. Department of Energy, U. S. natural gas industry, and Gas Research Institute is developing a high efficiency gas-fired paper dryer based {{on a combination of}} a ribbon burner and advanced heat transfer enhancement technique. The Gas-Fired Paper Dryer (GFPD) is a high-efficiency alternative to conventional steam-heated drying drums that typically operate at surface temperatures in the 300 ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂºF range. The new approach was evaluated in laboratory and pilot-scale testing at the Western Michigan University Paper Pilot Plant. Drum surface temperatures of more than 400 ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂºF were reached with linerboard (basis weight 126 lb/ 3000 ft 2) production and resulted in a 4 - 5 times increase in drying rate over a conventional steam-heated <b>drying</b> <b>drum.</b> Successful GFPD development and commercialization will provide large energy savings to the paper industry and increase paper production rates from dryer-limited (space- or steam-limited) paper machines by an estimated 10 to 20 %, resulting in significant capital costs savings for both retrofits and new capacity...|$|E

40|$|Mycotoxin {{producing}} fungi {{are natural}} contaminants of cereals and their toxins are harmful to humans and animals. Ochratoxin A (OTA) {{is among the}} most important. Heat treatment by <b>drum</b> <b>drying</b> does not eliminate already formed mycotoxins but the technique can reduce the number of viable fungi on the grain. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish a drying regime that kills fungal propagules on rye without reducing its quality for baking. Special attention was paid to some important mycotoxin producing species. As drying temperatures and retention time in the drum are essential, the <b>drum</b> <b>drier</b> must be equipped with an effective control unit. Two different control systems were tested. The results showed that fungi colonising the grain can be much more efficiently and precisely reduced by controlling the maximum grain temperature (MGT) than the fixed constant drying air temperature (FAT). <b>Drum</b> <b>drying</b> very efficiently reduced the fungal propagules colonising the grain, including the mycotoxin producing Penicillium verrucosum, Fusarium avenaceum, F. culmorum, F. poae, F. sporotrichioides and F. tricinctum. Both temperature and retention time in the drum affected survival rate of the fungi. Using MGT, a retention time of 10. 5 min and a temperature of 64 ºC killed 99 % of the yeast propagules and 98 % of the filamentous fungi. Moisture contents were reduced to about 12 %. A similar drying regime in a supplementary trial reduced the number of P. verrucosum contaminated kernels from more than 70 % to 12 % but confirmed that <b>drum</b> <b>drying</b> did not destroy already formed OTA. The combination of a high drying capacity and a short but efficient heat treatment was obtained by <b>drum</b> <b>drying</b> as opposed to on-floor, batch and ordinary continuous flow drying, and it reduced the risk of mould deterioration to almost zero when the grain was properly stored afterwards. At the same time a high quality for baking was maintained. The highest baking quality in rye was obtained at grain temperatures of about 62 °C and only at grain temperatures above 70 °C visual quality changes were detected...|$|R
