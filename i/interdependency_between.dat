In the CRU-TIAL 3 project the <b>interdependencies</b> <b>between</b> the electricity infrastruc-ture (EI) and the information infrastructure (II) responsible for its con-trol, maintenance and management have been thoroughly studied; more-over countermeasures to substantially reduce the risk to interrupt the service have been developed in the project. The possible interdependen-cies have been investigated by means of model at different abstraction levels. In this paper, we present high level models describing the various <b>interdependencies</b> <b>between</b> the EI and the II infrastructures, then we il-lustrate on a simple scenario how these models can be detailed to allow the evaluation of some measures of dependability. ...|$|R

40|$|Analyzing machine {{investment}} opportunities from a systems perspective {{requires an understanding}} of <b>interdependencies</b> <b>between</b> machine investment and utilization decisions. Machine investment decisions involve determining the number of machines to purchase and their types. Machine utilization decisions involve determining part allocations and production cycles. <b>Interdependencies</b> <b>between</b> these decisions result in trade-offs between investment and operating costs. This paper develops an analytical approach for studying machine {{investment opportunities}} in a broad systems context. It begins {{with a discussion of}} the <b>interdependencies</b> <b>between</b> investment and utilization decisions. The focus of this research and a review of existing literature related to machine investment decisions are then discussed. Next a mathematical model that quantifies these interdependencies is formulated. The paper ends with a simple example that demonstrates the usefulness of the model and highlights the importance of using a systems approach. The main contribution of this work is the simultaneous consideration of trade-offs between machine investment and utilization decisions. facilities/equipment planning, production inventory, operating characteristics, machine investment, cost/benefit analysis...|$|R

50|$|With {{regard to}} {{knowledge}} systems Wagner theorizes {{that people have}} access to others’ representational systems to enable concerted interaction even and particularly in cases of conflict. Hence, he suggested {{the existence of a}} system of holomorphic representations that encompass not only an individual’s or a group’s representation of an issue but also bits and pieces of the adversary’s view of the world. Ragini Sen and Wolfgang Wagner show how in violent conflict this <b>interdependency</b> <b>between</b> representations of opposed groups can take the form of „hetero-reference“, where one group’s representation in fact depends on the existence of the opponent group’s ideology or religion.|$|E

The term coordination refers to the ways of managing <b>interdependencies</b> <b>between</b> activities, which involve different entities working together toward a mutually defined goal [26]. Its other terms, i.e., cooperation, integration, and collaboration, also deal with the management of <b>interdependencies</b> <b>between</b> activities; however, in the context of supply chain, these alternative terms could be considered {{as an integral part of}} supply chain coordination [6].|$|R
30|$|The main {{theoretical}} premise for ecosystem {{research is}} the simultaneous presence of complementarities and <b>interdependencies</b> <b>between</b> actors. Complementarities between actors stem {{from the fact that}} the functions performed by their respective offers help to create or enhance the user value proposition. <b>Interdependencies</b> <b>between</b> actors stem {{from the fact that the}}ir offers are connected within a system-level architecture. While complementarities represent an economic relationship between offers in terms of the potential for value creation, interdependencies represent a structural relationship between offers in terms of how they are connected for the value to be created and how a change in one offer may affect the contribution of other offers towards value creation.|$|R
50|$|Apelin {{receptor}} {{is expressed}} in several cell types of the gastro-intestinal tract : stomach enterochromaffine-like cells; unknown cells of endocrine pancreas, colon epithelial cells.In stomach, activation of receptors on enterochromaffine-like cells by apelin secreted by parietal cells can inhibit histamine release by enterochromaffine-like cells, which in turn decreases acid secretion by parietal cells. In pancreas, apelin inhibits the insulin secretion induced by glucose. This inhibition reveals the functional <b>interdependency</b> <b>between</b> apelin signalling and insulin signalling observed at the adipocyte level where insulin stimulate apelin production. Recently, receptor expression was also detected in skeletic muscle cells. Its activation is involved in glucose uptake and participates in the control of glucose blood levels glycemia.|$|E
50|$|In their scriptural searches, many brethren came to {{the view}} that <b>interdependency</b> <b>between</b> churches is taught in the New Testament. Provincial and wider groupings of churches are {{mentioned}} in Galatians 1:2 and 1 Peter 1:1. Paul taught the same doctrine throughout all the churches (1 Cor. 1:2; 7:17). As to their principle of government, it was understood from Acts 15 that cohesion among the local churches of God was maintained by a united elderhood. Thus the churches collectively were one house; the house of God. All this answers to the Old Testament which provided in practice for the consultation of city elders in judgement (Deut. 19:12), and in type provided for the linking of tabernacle curtains, so that the tabernacle was one (Ex. 26:6).|$|E
50|$|Social {{psychologists have}} {{suggested}} that sexism may be inherently different from other forms of ambivalent prejudice, in that there is <b>interdependency</b> <b>between</b> {{women and men in}} social structures. A central argument to the theory of ambivalent sexism is {{the idea that there is}} a complicated balance of power between men and women, such that men have structural power and women have dyadic power (stemming from dependence between two people). Dyadic power reflects the notion that men depend on women to fulfill certain goals, such as heterosexual intimacy and childbearing. Glick and Fiske assert that men's dependence on women is what fuels benevolently sexist attitudes, leading to idolization and the placing of women on a pedestal. In other words, power relationships between men and women foster an ambivalent form of bias towards women.|$|E
