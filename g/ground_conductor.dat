40|$|Results of {{research}} on distribution of electric potentials on the earth surface in the territory with a <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> are analyzed. It is shown that potential over {{the center of a}} square <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> can be higher than that over the electrode. It is suggested to estimate the limit size of the cell of a complex net <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> depending on the depth of its laying. It is found that a two-level design of the <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> reduces touch voltage. Novelty of the results consists in application of a mathematical model to investigating electric characteristics of a two-level <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> versus its laying depth...|$|R
25|$|A {{lightning}} protection installation on a watercraft comprises a lightning protector {{mounted on the}} top of a mast or superstructure, and a <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> in contact with the water. Electrical conductors attach to the protector and run down to the conductor. For a vessel with a conducting (iron or steel) hull, the <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> is the hull. For a vessel with a non-conducting hull, the <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> may be retractable, attached to the hull, or attached to a centerboard.|$|R

25|$|Printed circuit boardsâ€”metal {{conductive}} {{areas in}} different layers of a multi-layer {{printed circuit board}} {{can act as a}} highly stable capacitor. It is common industry practice to fill unused areas of one PCB layer with the <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> and another layer with the power conductor, forming a large distributed capacitor between the layers.|$|E
25|$|Generally every AC {{power line}} {{transformer}} {{acts as an}} isolation transformer, and every step up or down {{has the potential to}} form an isolated circuit. However, this isolation would prevent failed devices from blowing fuses when shorted to their <b>ground</b> <b>conductor.</b> The isolation that could be created by each transformer is defeated by always having one leg of the transformers grounded, {{on both sides of the}} input and output transformer coils. Power lines also typically ground one specific wire at every pole, to ensure current equalization from pole to pole if a short to ground is occurring.|$|E
2500|$|These {{conductors}} are {{bonded to}} earth either through the metal {{structure of a}} pole or tower, or by additional ground electrodes installed at regular intervals along the line. As a general rule, overhead power lines with voltages below 50 kV {{do not have a}} [...] "static" [...] conductor, but most lines carrying more than 50 kV do. The <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> cable may also support fibre optic cables for data transmission.|$|E
25|$|Permanently {{installed}} electrical equipment, unless {{not required}} to, have permanently connected <b>grounding</b> <b>conductors.</b> Portable electrical devices with metal cases may have them connected to earth ground by a pin on the attachment plug (see Domestic AC power plugs and sockets).

2500|$|UF-B {{cable is}} [...] "underground feeder" [...] cable, which {{regardless}} of wire gauge {{has a solid}} waterproof grey sheath completely surrounding and filling {{the space between the}} conductors, which still have their individual colors. [...] Other types of armored or metallic cable (types AC and MC) have an aluminum casing that may be used as a <b>ground</b> <b>conductor,</b> for which {{it is not necessary to}} calculate an equivalent wire gauge.|$|E
2500|$|Electrical {{circuits}} may {{be connected}} to ground (earth) for several reasons. [...] In mains powered equipment, exposed metal parts are connected to ground to prevent user contact with dangerous voltage when electrical insulation fails. [...] In electrical power distribution systems, a protective <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> {{is an essential part}} of the safety earthing system. [...] Connection to ground also limits the build-up of static electricity when handling flammable products or electrostatic-sensitive devices. In some telegraph and power transmission circuits, the earth itself can be used as one conductor of the circuit, saving the cost of installing a separate return conductor (see single-wire earth return).|$|E
2500|$|Ideally, the {{underground}} {{part of the}} assembly should reside {{in an area of}} high ground conductivity. If {{the underground}} cable is able to resist corrosion well, it can be covered in salt to improve its electrical connection with the ground. While the electrical resistance of the lightning conductor between the air terminal and the Earth is of significant concern, the inductive reactance of the conductor could be more important. For this reason, the down conductor route is kept short, and any curves have a large radius. If these measures are not taken, lightning current may arc over a resistive or reactive obstruction that it encounters in the conductor. At the very least, the arc current will damage the lightning conductor and can easily find another conductive path, such as building wiring or plumbing, and cause fires or other disasters. Grounding systems without low resistivity to the ground can still be effective in protecting a structure from lightning damage. When ground soil has poor conductivity, is very shallow, or non-existent, a grounding system can be augmented by adding ground rods, counterpoise (ground ring) conductor, cable radials projecting away from the building, or a concrete building's reinforcing bars can be used for a <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> (Ufer ground). These additions, while still not reducing the resistance of the system in some instances, will allow the [...] of the lightning into the earth without damage to the structure.|$|E
50|$|FMC {{may be used}} as an {{equipment}} <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> if specific provisions are met regarding the trade size and length of FMC used, depending on the amperage of the circuits contained in the conduit. In general, {{an equipment}} <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> must be pulled through the FMC with an ampacity suitable to carry the fault current likely imposed on the largest circuit contained within the FMC.|$|R
50|$|Some {{types of}} metal conduit may {{also serve as}} a useful bonding <b>conductor</b> for <b>grounding</b> (earthing), but wiring {{regulations}} may also dictate workmanship standards or supplemental means of grounding for certain types. While metal conduit may sometimes be used as a <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor,</b> the circuit length is limited. For example, a long run of conduit as <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> may have too high an electrical resistance, and not allow proper operation of overcurrent devices on a fault.|$|R
50|$|It is {{very often}} assumed that these colors are {{dictated}} by the National Electric Code (NEC), however they are not. The NEC only requires that green must only {{be used for the}} equipment <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> (NEC Article 250.119) and only white or grey for the neutral (<b>grounded)</b> <b>conductor</b> (NEC Article 200.6). These colors may not be used for any other purpose, nor may their purpose use a different color. No other colors are specified by the NEC for general power distribution.|$|R
50|$|If a <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> is also needed, it must {{be added}} {{in a way that}} will not {{interfere}} with the star-quad geometry. It should also be added in a geometric configuration that exposes the <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> to equal interference from all four star-quad conductors. The most common solution is to wrap the star quad with a cylindrical <b>ground</b> <b>conductor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Any {{line that}} has a {{different}} impedance of the return path may be considered an unbalanced line. However, unbalanced lines usually consist of a conductor that is considered the signal line and another conductor that is grounded, or is ground itself. The <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> often {{takes the form of}} a ground plane or the screen of a cable. The <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> may be, and often is, common to multiple independent circuits. For this reason the <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> may be referred to as common.|$|E

50|$|The ground {{electrode}} in Finland is situated near Rantala. From there an overhead electrode line on wooden poles runs first in Northeast, than in Northern direction until Ruokalho, where it meets the overhead line with two high voltage conductors. From Ruokalho to Rauma static inverter plant the electrode line is fixed {{on a small}} crossbar above the high voltage conductors of Fenno-Skan and serves as <b>ground</b> <b>conductor.</b> In opposite to a normal <b>ground</b> <b>conductor</b> it is mounted on insulators equipped with surge arrestors.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are special}} {{provisions}} in the NEC for so-called technical equipment, mainly professional grade audio and video equipment supplied by so-called [...] "balanced" [...] 120 volt circuits. The center tap of a transformer is connected to ground, and the equipment is supplied by two line wires each 60 volts to ground (and 120 volts between line conductors). The center tap is not distributed to the equipment and no neutral conductor is used. These cases generally use a <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> which is separated from the safety <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> specifically {{for the purposes of}} noise and [...] "hum" [...] reduction.|$|R

50|$|As {{the neutral}} point of an {{electrical}} supply system is often connected to earth ground, ground and neutral are closely related. Under certain conditions, a conductor used {{to connect to}} a system neutral is also used for grounding (earthing) of equipment and structures. Current carried on a <b>grounding</b> <b>conductor</b> can result in objectionable or dangerous voltages appearing on equipment enclosures, so the installation of <b>grounding</b> <b>conductors</b> and neutral conductors is carefully defined in electrical regulations. Where a neutral conductor is used also to connect equipment enclosures to earth, {{care must be taken}} that the neutral conductor never rises to a high voltage with respect to local ground.|$|R
