50|$|<b>Guide</b> <b>wires</b> are {{an example}} of an {{application}} for biomedical coatings. <b>Guide</b> <b>wires</b> are used in coronary angioplasty to correct the effects of coronary artery disease, a disease that allows plaque build up {{on the walls of the}} arteries. The <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> is threaded up through the femoral artery to the obstruction. The <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> <b>guides</b> the balloon catheter to the obstruction where the catheter is inflated to press the plaque against the arterial walls. <b>Guide</b> <b>wires</b> are commonly made from stainless steel or Nitinol and require polymer coatings as a surface modification to reduce friction in the arteries. The coating of the <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> can affect the trackability, or the ability of the wire to move through the artery without kinking, the tactile feel, or the ability of the doctor to feel the <b>guide</b> <b>wire's</b> movements, and the thrombogenicity of the wire.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{experienced}} {{a rare and}} serious case of fractured hydrophilic <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> necessitating surgical intervention during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for a tortuous and calcified stenosis in the proximal right coronary artery. An 85 -year-old female presented to our hospital and was diagnosed as having unstable angina. A 0. 014 in. hydrophilic <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> (HI-TORQUE WHISPER MS Guide Wire™, Abbott Vascular, Abbott Park, IL, USA) was fractured during PCI trying to pass a microcatheter Corsair™ (ASAHI INTEC, Seto, Japan). During the procedure to retrieve the retained <b>guide</b> <b>wire,</b> the distal segment of the fractured <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> penetrated the atherosclerotic coronary wall and ascending aorta unexpectedly. The surgical procedure could be performed successfully by extracting the fractured <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> segments and stopping the bleeding. The edge of a hydrophilic <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> that is fractured by friction between the microcatheter and <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> is extremely sharp and can perforate both the atherosclerotic coronary vessel wall and aortic wall. Caution should be exercised when using such a device in combination with a polymer-jacketed wire at an acute angulated and calcified lesion. <Learning objective: <b>Guide</b> <b>wires</b> {{are the most common}} devices for interventional cardiologists. <b>Guide</b> <b>wire</b> fracture is a rare complication, but cardiologists should be well informed about it.

A two-step procedure is utilized to track the <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> in subsequent frames. First a rough estimate of the displacement is obtained using a template matching procedure.

40|$|Performing {{minimally}} invasive vascular interventions requires proper training, as a <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> {{needs to be}} manipulated, by the tail, under fluoroscopic guidance.

30|$|Recent {{developments}} in fracture fixation, incorporating locking screws {{to improve the}} biomechanical construct, have been introduced to implants for internal fixation in proximal femoral osteotomy [9, 10, 11]. A second significant innovation was {{the development of a}} one-piece cannulated blade plate, which can be inserted over a <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> [12]. The <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> is inserted in the desired position in the proximal femur. The seating chisel is passed over the <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> to cut the track for the blade plate, which is also inserted over the <b>guide</b> <b>wire.</b> This differs from classical PFO with AO blade plate fixation, in which a <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> is inserted in the proximal femur and the insertion of the seating chisel and implant is referenced from the position and direction of this wire, but not passed directly over the <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> [7, 8]. The cannulated blade plate concept was described by Grant and colleagues in 1990 but has only become widely available commercially in recent years [12, 13]. In 2013, Poul and colleagues reported more precise correction of proximal femoral deformities in a study in which the Cannulated Paediatric Osteotomy System (CAPOS) was compared to the conventional angled blade plate (Synthes) [13].|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: Most central venous {{catheters}} {{are placed}} using Seldinger <b>guide</b> <b>wires.</b> EN ISO 11070 is the guideline for testing <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> flexing performance and tensile strength, {{and we can}} safely assume that <b>guide</b> <b>wires</b> in use meet these requirements. Unfortunately, EN ISO 11070 guidelines {{do not reflect the}} clinical requirements and we continue to see mechanical failures and their associated complications. Material and Methods: This in vitro study was performed in an accredited laboratory. With regard to flexing, we: (1) Established the minimum flexing performance needed to meet clinical requirements, (2) developed flexing performance tests which mimic clinical requirement, and (3) evaluated the mechanical properties of various <b>guide</b> <b>wires</b> relative to these requirements. With regard to tensile strength, we used the testing method prescribed in ISO 11070, but did not end the test at 5 Newton (N). We continued until the <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> was damaged, or we reached maximum tractive force. We then did a wire-to-wire comparison. We examined two basic wire constructions, monofil and core and coil. Results: Tensile strength: All wires tested, except one, met EN ISO 11070 requirements for 5 N tensile strength. The mean of the wire types tested ranged from 15. 06 N to 257. 76 N. Flexing performance: None of the wires kinked. The monofil had no evidence of bending. Two core/coil wires displayed minor bending (angle 1. 5 °). All other wires displayed bending angles between 22. 5 ° and 43. 0 °. Conclusion: We recommend that: (1) Clinicians use <b>guide</b> <b>wires</b> with high-end mechanical properties, (2) EN ISO 11070 incorporate our flexing test into their testing method, raise the flexing requirement to kink-proof, (3) and raise the tensile strength requirement to a minimum of 30 N, and (3) all manufacturers and suppliers be required to display mechanical properties of all <b>guide</b> <b>wire,</b> and <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> kits sold...|$|R

METHODS: In vivo microcatheterizations of brachiocephalic arteries were performed in two swine using the 0. 014 -inch Doppler <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> and a commonly used microcatheter. A standardized, bench-top method of evaluating basic mechanical properties of micro-guide wires was also {{used to compare the}} 0. 014 -inch Doppler <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> with a commonly used micro-guide wire. RESULTS: The 0. 014 -inch Doppler <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> had similar steerability, tractability, torque control, and distal tip flexibility to the commonly used micro-guide wire in the in vivo simulations. Frequent micro-guide wire exchanges were possible without loss of superselective positioning of the microcatheter.

30|$|Patients were {{positioned}} supine on a radiolucent operating table. After routine preparation, {{the affected}} limb was draped to allow {{free movement of}} the hip. Under the image intensifier, the hip was examined and positioned, usually rotated internally, to show the maximum profile of the femoral neck. Through a 2 -cm incision, a <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> was introduced to enter the lateral and proximal aspect of the femur just distal to the greater trochanteric growth plate. The <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> was passed across the inferomedial half of the proximal femoral physis. Care was taken to avoid advancing the <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> into the hip joint. The length of screw was measured off the <b>guide</b> <b>wire,</b> {{with the expectation that}} the screw should be slightly proud on the lateral aspect of the femur. The screw was then passed carefully over the <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> into the femoral head. At the stage where the screw advances on the threads of the <b>guide</b> <b>wire,</b> additional caution was exercised to avoid inadvertently advancing the wire into and across the hip. The screw was advanced until the tip of the screw reached the subchondral bone, and the position was confirmed with the image intensifier. In this series an 8 -mm Stryker ASNIS (Stryker Orthopaedics, Mahwah, NJ, USA) or a 7.3 -mm Synthes cannulated screw (Synthes, Oberdorf, Switzerland) was used. Fully threaded screws were preferred to facilitate potential screw removal later, but partially threaded screws were used when fully threaded screws were unavailable.|$|R
