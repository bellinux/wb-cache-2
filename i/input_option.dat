40|$|This master thesis aims {{to provide}} a new <b>input</b> <b>option</b> for instant {{messaging}} (IM) on mobile devices. To make this possible we developed Amigo. Amigo is a mobile instant messaging client for handheld computers that allows handwriting as well as free-form images to be sent between people. This thesis describes the design,implementation and evaluation of Amigo. Our main issue was to examine whether uninterpreted handwriting can be a suitable input method for instant messaging on handheld devices. Our second purpose was to investigate how such an application is used. Recent {{years there has been}} a growing interest in the area of instant messaging. The emerging mobile market has resulted in IM software recently becoming available for mobile devices. The input options for text entry on most handheld computers today are virtual keyboards or the use of handwritten text that is interpretable by a character recognizer. However, these input methods are both slow and error prone. Since IM is human-to-human communication and the IM client only is the transferring medium, the computer need not interpret the text in the messages. When adapting IM to mobile devices with a pen-based interface it is possible to use uninterpreted handwriting as <b>input</b> <b>option,</b> since {{it is not necessary to}} translate the input into text. To evaluate Amigo we conducted a study at a local university, where 20 students used Amigo for two weeks. Our main findings are that uninterpreted handwriting functions well as input method for mobile instant messaging, and also introduces new ways for people to interact using instant messaging. These are mixed text/image sessions, collaborative drawing and instant gaming. uninterpreted handwriting, digital ink...|$|E

Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and advanced signal analysis techniques, we were able to non-invasively reconstruct oscillations of distributed neural networks in the high-gamma frequency band (60 â 150 [*]Hz). The time course of the observed neural activity suggested that two-alternative forced choice tasks are processed in four overlapping stages: processing of sensory <b>input,</b> <b>option</b> evaluation, intention formation, and action execution. Visual areas are activated first, and show recurring activations throughout the entire decision process. The temporo-occipital junction and the intraparietal sulcus are active during evaluation of external values of the options, 250 â 500 [*]ms after stimulus presentation. Simultaneously, personal preference is mediated by cortical midline structures. Subsequently, the posterior parietal and superior occipital cortices appear to encode intention, with different subregions being responsible for different types of choice. The cerebellum and inferior parietal cortex are recruited for internal generation of decisions and actions, when all options have the same value. Action execution was accompanied by activation peaks in the contralateral motor cortex. These results suggest that high-gamma oscillations as recorded by MEG allow a reliable reconstruction of decision processes with excellent spatiotemporal resolution...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from October 4, 2016 - April 4, 2017 In the residential sector, wood is the predominant construction material. In the commercial sector and in midârise construction, the use of wood is limited because of a multitude of reasons, including building code restrictions, the perception of wood as a structural material, fire code requirements, and lack of knowledge and experience. Wood, being a natural, renewable material that sequesters carbon, is a natural fit for newer construction with enhanced sustainability goals. Moreover, wood can be recycled, sourced locally, and requires less energy intensive manufacturing and processing as compared to other conventional building products. Given the perceived environmental benefits of wood, {{it is imperative that}} a case is examined for wood to be included more extensively in the midârise and commercial sectors. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate and identify the environmental utility (avoided emissions) of using wood in place of steel and concrete in the commercial construction and renovation sectors in Oregon. The study used comparative cradleâtoâgrave, lifeâcycle assessment, with the help of the Athena Impact Estimator for Buildings. First, six case studies that represent different building functionalities, material systems, and construction techniques were modeled via the user interface <b>input</b> <b>option,</b> and the results were evaluated for global warming potential (GWP) and impacts on energy sources, such as fossil fuel consumption, when structural materials are substituted using wood.

Bills of materials (BOM) for both wood redesigns and the asâbuilt design were used as an input in the software and subsequently analyzed.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} popularity of cloud computing technologies, the expectations towards cloud providers increase {{not only in}} terms of functionality, cost, and service delivery speed, but also for the security of the customersâ data that is stored remotely. Cloud providers can be certified for their compliance with established industry standards for data security; however, there is minimal research published on how to design internal processes to achieve this goal. The objective of this thesis is to address this gap by providing a framework that can be used by cloud providers to create a process for monitoring customer data backups. The area of backup and restore is an important part of data security, as it ensures data integrity and availability. In order to address the research objective, the Design Science methodology is combined with the software development lifecycle so that a specific software-based instantiation of the framework can be designed, implemented and evaluated. The first outcome of the research is a set of 36 requirements for the software tool that are collected by interviewing business experts who work for SAP, a cloud provider and the partner of this research. It was found that the most important aspect of monitoring backups is to create a flexible <b>input</b> <b>option</b> for adding new system types. An intermediate outcome of the research is a method of discovering interconnections between requirements by using post-it notes that are placed on a whiteboard so that they can be positioned in relation to each other by drawing arrows and lines between them. The second major outcome is the software tool that is developed based on the findings from the requirements and is assessed for utility by a sample of users. The aspect of flexibility is addressed by basing the data collection on a search query that can be configured according to the usersâ specifications. By generalising the workings of the software tool, a framework is developed as the final outcome that is independent from the underlying technical base. It consists of four stages (system analysis, solution design and development, process operation, and communication) that should enable an implementing company to create a reliable backup monitoring process...|$|E
40|$|The MILDOS Computer Code {{estimates}} impacts from radioactive {{emissions from}} uranium milling facilities. These impacts {{are presented as}} dose commitments to individuals and the regional population within an 80 km radius of the facility. Only airborne releases of radioactive materials are considered: releases to surface water and to groundwater are not addressed in MILDOS. This code is multi-purposed {{and can be used}} to evaluate population doses for NEPA assessments, maximum individual doses for predictive 40 CFR 190 compliance evaluations, or maximum offsite air concentrations for predictive evaluations of 10 CFR 20 compliance. Emissions of radioactive materials from fixed point source locations and from area sources are modeled using a sector-averaged Gaussian plume dispersion model, which utilizes user-provided wind frequency data. Mechanisms such as deposition of particulates, resuspension. radioactive decay and ingrowth of daughter radionuclides are included in the transport model. Annual average air concentrations are computed, from which subsequent impacts to humans through various pathways are computed. Ground surface concentrations are estimated from deposition buildup and ingrowth of radioactive daughters. The surface concentrations are modified by radioactive decay, weathering and other environmental processes. The MILDOS Computer Code allows the user to vary the emission sources as a step function of time by adjustinq the emission rates. which includes shutting them off completely. Thus the results of a computer run can be made to reflect changing processes throughout the facility&#x 27;s operational lifetime. The pathways considered for individual dose commitments and for population impacts are: â¢ Inhalation â¢ External exposure from ground concentrations â¢ External exposure from cloud immersion â¢ Ingestioo of vegetables â¢ Ingestion of meat â¢ Ingestion of milk â¢ Dose commitments are calculated using dose conversion factors, which are ultimately based on recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). These factors are fixed internally in the code, and {{are not part of the}} <b>input</b> <b>option.</b> Dose commitments which are available from the code are as follows: â¢ Individual dose commitments for use in predictive 40 CFR 190 compliance evaluations (Radon and short-lived daughters are excluded) â¢ Total individual dose commitments (impacts from all available radionuclides are considered) â¢ Annual population dose commitments (regional, extraregional, total and cummulative). This model is primarily designed for uranium mill facilities, and should not be used for operations with different radionuclides or processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{extension}} to LWRs {{of the use}} of Deep-Burn coated particle fuel envisaged for HTRs has been investigated. TRISO coated fuel particles are used in Fully-Ceramic Microencapsulated (FCM) fuel within a SiC matrix rather than the graphite of HTRs. TRISO particles are well characterized for uranium-fueled HTRs. However, operating conditions of LWRs are different from those of HTRs (temperature, neutron energy spectrum, fast fluence levels, power density). Furthermore, the time scales of transient core behavior during accidents are usually much shorter and thus more severe in LWRs. The PASTA code was updated for analysis of stresses in coated particle FCM fuel. The code extensions enable the automatic use of neutronic data (burnup, fast fluence as a function of irradiation time) obtained using the DRAGON neutronics code. An <b>input</b> <b>option</b> for automatic evaluation of temperature rise during anticipated transients was also added. A new thermal model for FCM was incorporated into the code; so-were updated correlations (for pyrocarbon coating layers) suitable to estimating dimensional changes at the high fluence levels attained in LWR DB fuel. Analyses of the FCM fuel using the updated PASTA code under nominal and accident conditions show: (1) Stress levels in SiC-coatings are low for low fission gas release (FGR) fractions of several percent, as based on data of fission gas diffusion in UO{sub 2 } kernels. However, the high burnup level of LWR-DB fuel implies that the FGR fraction {{is more likely to be}} in the range of 50 - 100 %, similar to Inert Matrix Fuels (IMFs). For this range the predicted stresses and failure fractions of the SiC coating are high for the reference particle design (500 {micro}mm kernel diameter, 100 {micro}mm buffer, 35 {micro}mm IPyC, 35 {micro}mm SiC, 40 {micro}mm OPyC). A conservative case, assuming 100 % FGR, 900 K fuel temperature and 705 MWd/kg (77 % FIMA) fuel burnup, results in a 8. 0 x 10 {sup - 2 } failure probability. For a 'best-estimate' FGR fraction of 50 % and a more modest burnup target level of 500 MWd/kg,the failure probability drops below 2. 0 x 10 {sup - 5 }, the typical performance of TRISO fuel made under the German HTR research program. An optimization study on particle design shows improved performance if the buffer size is increased from 100 to 120 {micro}mm while reducing the OPyC layer. The presence of the latter layer does not provide much benefit at high burnup levels (and fast fluence levels). Normally the shrinkage of the OPyC would result in a beneficial compressive force on the SiC coating. However, at high fluence levels the shrinkage is expected to turn into swelling, resulting in the opposite effect. However, this situation is different when the SiC-matrix, in which the particles are embedded, is also considered: the OPyC swelling can result in a beneficial compressive force on the SiC coating since outward displacement of the OPyC outer surface is inhibited by the presence of the also-swelling SiC matrix. Taking some credit for this effect by adopting a 5 {micro}mm SiC-matrix layer, the optimized particle (100 {micro}mm buffer and 10 {micro}mm OPyC), gives a failure probability of 1. 9 x 10 {sup - 4 } for conservative conditions. During a LOCA transient, assuming core re-flood in 30 seconds, the temperature of the coated particle can be expected to be about 200 K higher than nominal temperature (900 K). For this event the particle failure fraction for a conservative case is 1. 0 x 10 {sup - 2 }, for the optimized particle design. For a FGR-fraction of 50 % this value reduces to 6. 4 x 10 {sup - 4 }...|$|E
