500|$|After Victoria's {{divorce from}} Ernst, Grand Duke Kirill, whom Victoria {{had seen on}} all her {{subsequent}} visits to Russia, was discouraged by his parents from {{trying to keep a}} close relationship with her. Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna told Kirill to keep Victoria as his mistress and marry someone else. A few months later, war broke out between Russia and Japan. As {{a senior member of the}} navy, Kirill was sent on active service to the front in the Russo-Japanese War. His ship was blown up by a Japanese mine while entering Port Arthur and he was one of the few survivors. Sent home to recover, the Tsar finally allowed him permission to leave Russia and he left for Coburg to be with Victoria. The narrow escape from death had hardened Kirill's determination to marry Victoria. [...] "To those over whom the shadow of death has passed, life has a new meaning," [...] Kirill wrote in his memoirs. [...] "It is like daylight. And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> within visible reach of fulfillment of the dream of my life. Nothing would cheat me of it now. I had gone through much. Now, at last, the future lay radiant before me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 1644, Cooper {{resigned}} {{all of his}} posts {{under the}} king, and travelled to Hurst Castle, {{the headquarters of the}} Parliamentarians. Called before the Committee of Both Kingdoms, on 6 March 1644, he explained that he believed that Charles <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> being influenced by Roman Catholic influences (Catholics were increasingly prominent at Charles' court, and he had recently signed a truce with Irish Catholic rebels) and that he believed Charles had no intention of [...] "promoting or preserving... the Protestant religion and the liberties of the kingdom" [...] and that he therefore believed the parliamentary cause was just, and he offered to take the Solemn League and Covenant.|$|E

Yet the German Army Manual states clearly that no German soldier can be tried unless he is clearly of sound mind and body, in a condition {{to hear the evidence}} against him. I looked up the passage again, to make sure, and consulted with my fellow judges...In my opinion and that of my fellow officers, Hermann Fegelein was in no condition to stand trial, or for that matter to even stand. I closed the proceedings...So I turned Fegelein over to [...] General Rattenhuber and his security squad. I never saw the man again." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, {{after two}} albums and an EP, Samhain was signed {{to a major}} label by Rubin {{and the name of}} the band was changed to Danzig to allow the band to retain its name in the event of line-up changes. Danzig {{discussed}} the reasoning behind the name change: “Rick [...] convinced me it was the way to go, and would also provide me with a lot more artistic freedom. After all, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> in charge of where we were going musically, so if I didn't want to do something, it was a lot easier to say so." [...] Danzig's intention at the time was for each album he recorded to consist of a different recording line-up, allowing him to keep working with different musicians. The original band consisted of guitarist John Christ, bassist Eerie Von, and former Circle Jerks–DOA–Black Flag drummer Chuck Biscuits.|$|E

2500|$|In 1995, {{following}} a spell {{in a drug}} rehab clinic, which first alerted the public to her drug problem, Westbrook was reintroduced into EastEnders by executive producer Corinne Hollingworth. She has commented, [...] "the call from the producers couldn't {{have come at a}} more opportune moment for me. The soap was suffering from poor ratings and so they decided, as they normally do, to bring some familiar faces back onto the Square. The producers were aware of my addiction by now [...] but they had also read that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> clean [...] once I assured them that I was well [...] they invited me back for another year." [...] The character's [...] "dramatic" [...] return to EastEnders aired on 25 July 1995 and began when her screen brothers traced Sam to Spain and she ended up in bed with [...] "bad boy" [...] David Wicks (Michael French). Several cast changes had occurred since Westbrook had last been in the soap, including a recast of her screen mother Peggy, who was now played by Barbara Windsor. As well as her former friends, Westbrook has revealed that she became particularly close to Windsor, who she says [...] "instantly took me under her wing", and Martine McCutcheon, who played Tiffany Raymond.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 March 1932, Puyi {{made his}} {{ceremonial}} entry into Changchun, sharing his car with Zheng who was beaming with joy, Amakasu whose expression was stern as usual, and Wanrong, who looked miserable. Puyi remembered about {{his first time}} in Changchun: [...] "I saw Japanese gendarmes, and rows of people, wearing all sots of clothes; some were in Chinese jackets and gowns, some were in Western suits and some in traditional Japanese dress, {{and they were all}} holding small flags in their hands. I was thrilled and reflected that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>now</b> seeing the scene that I missed at the harbor. As I walked past them Hsi Hsia [...] pointed out a line of dragon flags between the Japanese ones and said that the men holding them were all Manchu [...] "bannermen" [...] who had been waiting for me to come for twenty years. These words brought tears to my eyes, and I was more strongly convinced than ever that my future was very hopeful". Puyi also noted he was [...] "too preoccupied with my hopes and hates" [...] to realize the [...] "cold comfort that the Changchun citizens, silent from terror and hatred, were giving me". Puyi's friend, the British journalist Woodhead, who covered his arrival in Manchuria, wrote [...] "outside official circles, I met no Chinese who felt any enthusiasm for the new regime", and that the city of Harbin was being terrorized by Chinese and Russian gangsters working for the Japanese, making Harbin [...] "lawless... even its main street unsafe after dark". In an interview with Woodhead, Puyi stated he planned to govern Manchukuo “in the Confucian spirit” and he was “perfectly happy” with his new position. An Italian journalist from the Corriere della Sera newspaper wrote: “I was unable to interview this pale, tired prince who doesn’t’ like to talk, who is always plunged in his meditations and who maybe regrets his life as a simple, studious citizen. He has a fixed stare behind his black-framed glasses. When we were introduced, he responded with a friendly nod. But his smile lasted only a second. We could only await the word of the Master of Ceremonies to give us permission to bow ourselves out. A Japanese colonel, our guide, showed us the triumphal arches, the electric light decorations and endless flags. But all this, say the shopkeepers is [...] "made in Osaka"”.|$|E
