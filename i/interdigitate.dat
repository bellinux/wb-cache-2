Skin from a biopsy will show clubbed epidermal projections that <b>interdigitate</b> with dermis on microscopy. Epidermal thickening is another characteristic histologic finding of psoriasis lesions. The stratum granulosum layer of the epidermis is often missing or significantly decreased in psoriatic lesions; the skin cells from the most superficial layer of skin are also abnormal as they never fully mature. Unlike their mature counterparts, these superficial cells keep their nucleus. Inflammatory infiltrates can typically be visualized on microscopy when examining skin tissue or joint tissue affected by psoriasis. Epidermal skin tissue affected by psoriatic inflammation often has many CD8+ T cells while a predominance of CD4+ T cells makes up the inflammatory infiltrates of the dermal layer of skin and the joints.|$|E

2500|$|The {{skeleton}} of Dallasaurus turneri, described by Bell and Polcyn (2005), has {{a mixture of}} features present in the skeletons of derived mosasaurs and in the skeletons of mosasaurid ancestors, such as aigialosaurids. Dallasaurus retains facultatively terrestrial limbs similar in their structure to the limbs of aigialosaurids and terrestrial squamates (plesiopedal limb condition), unlike derived mosasaurids, which evolved paddle-like limbs (hydropedal limb condition). However, the {{skeleton of}} Dallasaurus simultaneously had several characters that linked it with derived members of the subfamily Mosasaurinae; the authors of its description listed [...] "invasion of the parietal by medial tongues from the frontal, teeth with smooth medial enamel surface, high coronoid buttress on surangular, <b>interdigitate</b> anterior scapulo-coracoid suture, humeral postglenoid process, elongate atlas synapophysis, sharp anterodorsal ridge on synapophyses, vertically oriented vertebral condyles, elongate posterior thoracic vertebrae, and fused haemal arches" [...] as the characters uniting Dallasaurus with Mosasaurinae. The phylogenetic analysis conducted by Bell and Polcyn indicated that hydropedal mosasaurids did not form a clade that wouldn't also include plesiopedal taxa, such as Dallasaurus, Yaguarasaurus, Russellosaurus, Tethysaurus, Haasiasaurus and Komensaurus (in 2005 only informally known as [...] "Trieste aigialosaur"); the analysis indicated that hydropedal limb condition evolved independently in three different groups of mosasaurs (Halisaurinae, Mosasaurinae and the group containing the subfamilies Tylosaurinae and Plioplatecarpinae). The result of this phylogenetic study was subsequently mostly confirmed by the analyses conducted by Caldwell and Palci (2007) and Leblanc, Caldwell and Bardet (2012); the analysis conducted by Makádi, Caldwell and Ősi (2012) indicated that hydropedal limb condition evolved independently in two groups of mosasaurs (in Mosasaurinae and in the clade containing Halisaurinae, Tylosaurinae and Plioplatecarpinae). Conrad et al. (2011), on the other hand, recovered hydropedal mosasaurs forming a clade that excluded their plesiopedal relatives.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} for the ethanol-induced aggregation/fusion of uniform-sized small liposomes comprised of dipalmitoyl (DPPC) or egg yolk (eggPC) phosphatidylcholines was studied by measuring the average size using a photon correlation spectroscopy, by observing directly {{the states in the}} liposomal solutions using freeze-fracture electron microscopy and by attempting resonance energy transfer using fluorophore-labeled phospholipids. Abrupt increases in the apparent size of DPPC liposomes were observed in the presence of above 44 mg/ml ethanol, where microscopically plateau membranes form <b>interdigitated</b> structure, in which the acyl chains fully interpenetrate the hydrocarbon chains of the apposing monolayer. On the contrary, in the eggPC liposome, where the membranes cannot form <b>interdigitated</b> structures even in the presence of high concentration of ethanol, such intense aggregation and fusion were not observed, suggesting their intimate relation to the <b>interdigitated</b> structure formation. The formation of <b>interdigitated</b> structures in the adhering region leads to an increase in the interfacial area and an exposure of hydrophobic acyl chain terminal on the surface area, and enhances hydrophobic interactions between two <b>interdigitated</b> bilayers. Thus, the resultant <b>interdigitated</b> structure makes the aggregated state stable and partially initiates the bilayer mixing between the two apposed membranes, leading to fusion...|$|R

30|$|The {{incorporation}} of microfluidics with biosensing has the following advantages: multiplex assay and simultaneous {{separation of the}} targeted biomolecules for detection during the flow, for enhanced signal to noise ratio. However, it has the limitation due to the shear effect caused by the microfluidic flow on the antibodies immobilized on the sensing platform. In the current study, sensitivity variation due to microfluidic flow was established by detecting CA- 125 antigens in biofluid using gold <b>interdigitated</b> electrodes. At static drop condition, the signal response of antigen–antibody conjugation in gold nanoparticle-coated <b>interdigitated</b> electrodes is approximately 2.8 times than in plain <b>interdigitated</b> electrodes. At 20  kHz frequency, the signal response of plain <b>interdigitated</b> electrodes during antigen–antibody conjugation has increased from 260.80 to 736.33 pF when the gold nano particles are coated on the plain <b>interdigitated</b> electrodes. At microfluidic flow condition, the signal response of antigen–antibody conjugation in gold nanoparticle-coated <b>interdigitated</b> electrodes is 2.5 times than in plain <b>interdigitated</b> electrodes. At 20  kHz frequency, the signal response of plain <b>interdigitated</b> electrodes during antigen–antibody conjugation has increased from 205.85 to 518.48 pF when the gold nano particles are coated on the plain <b>interdigitated</b> electrodes. Based on the measured results, the following conclusions can be made. (1) The functionality of the individual layers in the sensing platform is validated with the measured change in capacitance. (2) The gold nanoparticle coated <b>interdigitated</b> electrode has higher sensitivity than the plain <b>interdigitated</b> electrode during the CA- 125 antigen antibody interaction. (3) The capacitive sensing signal response increased proportionally {{with the increase in}} concentration of the antigens during the antigen–antibody conjugation. (4) The effect of shear on the sensing signal response is evident given the lower capacitive signal during antigen–antibody conjugation in the microfluidic flow condition as compared to the static drop condition. The observed effect of shear stress in the microfluidic flow condition during the antigen–antibody conjugation can be mitigated by incorporating the following design changes in the sensing platform and microchannel. (i) The sensing platform with nano well-structure immobilized the antibody into each well, can reduce the shear effect during the microfluidic flow. (ii) The surface treatment to the microchannel for controlling the hydrophilicity of channel reduce the shear caused by the microfluidic flow significantly and thus the effect of the shear on sensing platform can be controlled. Though our focus was on isothermal microfluidic devices, the future work on evaluating the influence of thermal conditions on the sensing signal response in the microfluidic platform would provide additional information regarding the stability of the bioconjugation chemistries in thermocycling microfluidic biosensing applications.|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} {{of a number of}} spin labels in several lipid bilayers, shown by X-ray diffraction to be <b>interdigitated,</b> has been compared in order to evaluate the ability of the spin label technique to detect and diagnose the structure of lipid bilayers. The main difference between <b>interdigitated</b> and non-interdigitated gel phase bilayers which can be exploited for determination of their structure using spin labels, is that the former have a much less steep fluidity gradient. Thus long chain spin labels with the nitroxide group near the terminal methyl of the chain, such as 16 -doxylstearic acid, its methyl ester, or a phosphatidylglycerol spin label containing 16 -doxylstearic acid (PG-SL), are more motionally restricted and/or ordered in the <b>interdigitated</b> bilayer than in the non-interdigitated bilayer. This difference is large enough to be of diagnostic value for all three spin labels in the <b>interdigitated</b> bilayers of dihexadecylphosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/ethanol, and 1, 3 -dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. However, it is not large enough to be of diagnostic value at low temperatures. Use of probes with the nitroxide group closer to the apolar/polar interface reveals that these latter <b>interdigitated</b> bilayers are more disordered or less closely packed. As the temperature is increased, however, the motion of the PG-SL does not increase as much in these <b>interdigitated</b> bilayers as in non-interdigitated bilayers. The difference in the motion and/or order of PG-SL between <b>interdigitated</b> and non-interdigitated bilayers is large enough at higher temperatures to be of value in diagnosing the structure of the bilayers. Thus by choice of a suitable spin label and a suitable temperature, this technique should prove useful for detection and diagnosis of lipid bilayer structure with a good degree of reliability. Caution must, of course be exercised, as with any spectroscopic technique. Spin labels will also be invaluable for more detailed studies of known <b>interdigitated</b> bilayers, which would be time- and material-consuming, if carried out using X-ray diffraction solely...|$|R
