40|$|Chitosan is a {{biopolymer}} with immense structural {{advantage for}} chemical and mechanical modifications to generate novel properties, functions and applications. This work depicts new pyridinedicarboxylicacid (PDC) crosslinked chitosan-metal ion films as veritable material for cyanide ion removal from aqueous solution. The PDC-crosslinked chitosan-metal films (PDC-Chit–Ni(II) and PDC-Chit–Fe(III)) were formed by complexing PDC-crosslinked chitosan film with anhydrous nickel(II) and iron(III) chloride salts respectively. The PDC-Chit and its metal films were characterized employing various analytical and spectroscopic techniques. The FT-IR, UV–vis and the XRD results confirm {{the presence of}} the metal ions in the metal coordinated PDC-crosslinked chitosan film. The surface morphological difference of PDC-Chit-Ni(II) film before and after <b>decyanidation</b> was explored with scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, the quantitative amount of nickel(II) and iron(III) present in the complex were determined using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer as 32. 3 and 37. 2 μg/g respectively which portends the biopolymer film as a good complexing agent. Removal of cyanide from aqueous solution with PDC-Chit, PDC-Chit–Ni(II) and PDC-Chit–Fe(III) films was studied with batch equilibrium experiments. At equilibrium, <b>decyanidation</b> capacity (DC) followed the order PDC-Chit-Ni (II) ≈ PDC-Chit-Fe(III) > PDC-Chit. PDC-Chit-Ni(II) film gave 100 % CN− removal within 40 min <b>decyanidation</b> owing to favorable coordination geometry...|$|E

This result revealed {{the investigation of}} intermediate product and the probably metabolic pathway by ZJUTB 06 - 99 in acrylonitrile wastewater. According {{to the analysis of}} GC–MS, the supposed degradation pathway of acrylonitrile by strain ZJUTB 06 - 99 was shown above. The processes could be deduced that acrylonitrile was hydrolyzed to acrylic acid and NH 3 with the breakdown of –CN bond, indicated that the strain ZJUTB 06 - 99 has better effect on <b>decyanidation</b> to reduce the toxicity of acrylonitrile in wastewater. Figure  5 showed the degradation kinetic equation at acrylonitrile initial concentration of 200  mg/L. Analyzed by Origin 8.0, the degradation kinetics equation in acrylonitrile wastewater by ZJUTB 06 - 99 was lnC[*]=[*]−[*] 0.1784 t[*]+[*] 5.3349, and the degradation rate was 0.1784  h− 1. The result demonstrated that biodegradation reaction fit with the first-order kinetics.|$|E

Then, it was used in simulated acrylonitrile wastewater to investigate its possibility of <b>decyanidation</b> and denitrification. The possible biodegradation pathway of acrylonitrile and kinetics equation were discussed, separately. Furthermore, the biodegradation effects of acrylonitrile wastewater and their influencing factors were also exhibited. Finally, it was revealed the disadvantages of biodegradation with this strain and discovered the possible enhanced method to degrade acrylonitrile in wastewater, which was contributed to further exploration of practical application in acrylonitrile wastewater.|$|E
30|$|Acrylonitrile (C 3 H 3 N) {{widely used}} in {{chemical}} raw materials has biological toxicity with –CN bond, so it {{is the key to}} removal of cyanide from acrylonitrile wastewater. In our previous research and investigation, a strain was identified as Arthrobacter nitroguajacolicus named ZJUTB 06 - 99 and was proved to be capable of degrading acrylonitrile. In this paper, the strain ZJUTB 06 - 99 was domesticated with acrylonitrile-containing medium and its <b>decyanidation</b> and denitrification in simulated acrylonitrile wastewater were studied. The intermediate product of acrylonitrile in degradation process was identified through gas chromatography–mass spectrometer, as well as the biodegradation pathway of acrylonitrile in wastewater was deduced tentatively. The kinetics equation of biodegradation of acrylonitrile was lnC[*]=[*]−[*] 0.1784 t[*]+[*] 5.3349, with the degradation half-life of acrylonitrile in wastewater by 3.885  h. The results of this study showed that the optimum levels of temperature, pH and bacteria concentration to attain the maximum biodegradation were obtained as 30  °C, 6 and 100  g/L, respectively. The disadvantages of the biodegradation with this strain and its possible enhanced method to degrade acrylonitrile in wastewater were also discussed.|$|E
