40|$|The {{derivative}} action recently {{has emerged as}} a promising weapon to combat corporate wrongdoing even in countries that are traditionally not litigious. However the viability of such litigation as a tool is uncertain both from a theoretical and practical perspective. At one extreme of the {{derivative action}} debate, its close linkage with good shareholder protection and securities market development is stressed. As a result, transplanting the <b>derivation</b> <b>action</b> (and shareholder litigation in general) is recommended to improve shareholder protection which in its turn helps to foster the securities market. At the other extreme, more litigation is ill-advised since it contains costs which in some cases might exceed its potential benefits or even circumvent its policy objectives. Even though more litigation theoretically might bring more justice to oppressed shareholders in transition economy as Vietnam, in the sense that their rights might be better guaranteed, this justice ultimately depends on the practical institutional environment. If the legal infrastructure of a country does not support a heavy reliance on the court, enforcement through litigation might become a dormant weapon that shareholders cannot use to achieve the justice they aspire to. By using derivative action which has been more and more imported by Asian countries as an example of shareholder litigation, this article will examine the viability of a more litigious enforcement in Vietnam, and come with the conclusion of how desirable the derivative action is in the case of transition economies as Vietnam...|$|E
40|$|Derivative {{actions were}} a {{protection}} mechanism which allows shareholders to sue managers of companies and/or majority shareholders {{when they had}} opportunistic behaviours. The mechanism was introduced in Vietnam in 2010 by a sub-legislation.

Nature of derivative actions - a mechanism originated in common law countries - differs from other forms of shareholders litigation in Vietnam. This difference, unfortunately, is not in accordance with temporary civil procedures in Vietnam. Therefore, the article aims to discuss the different nature of this mechanism, give suggestions to improve current rules of <b>derivation</b> <b>actions,</b> and highlight the need to revise relevant rules for the effective functioning of that mechanism...|$|R

30|$|European countries, and {{especially}} Germany, are currently very much affected by human migration flows, in particular refugee flows. At present, the major drivers of migration are economic factors and armed conflicts. Although the refugees are seeking {{first and foremost}} temporary refuge, they may also wish {{to make a new}} home for themselves. European countries have long been confronted with the task of integrating migrants. 1 However, because of the somewhat unexpected extent of the current flows, the integration task is a challenge for most countries. Researchers have already developed several assumptions and models of how the integration process takes place. However, the empirical underpinning of these assumptions is based mostly on a small number of observed cases. This is due to several reasons, for example problems in reaching the migrant population and gaining their cooperation. Reaching more members of this population allows for more reliable verification of assumptions and more accurate <b>derivation</b> of <b>action</b> plans. Therefore, we need to improve the share of migrants in large-scale population surveys and thus enable policymakers to answer the integration questions that Europe is dealing with today.

40|$|AbstractWe {{propose a}} novel {{semantics}} for logic programs with negation by viewing {{the application of}} a clause in a <b>derivation</b> as an <b>action</b> in the situation calculus. Program clauses are then identified with situation calculus effect axioms as they are understood in axiomatic theories of actions. We then solve the frame problem for these effect axioms using a recent approach of Reiter [21], and identify the resulting collection of axioms with the semantics of the original logic problem. An interesting consequence of this approach is that the logic programming negation-as-failure operator inherits its nonmonotonicity from the nonmonotonicity associated with the frame problem. One advantage of our proposal is that like Clark's completion semantics, ours is also formulated explicitly in classical logic. To illustrate the usefulness of our semantics, we prove sufficient conditions for two logic programs to be equivalent, and use this to verify the correctness of the well-known unfolding program transformation operator. We also discuss applications of this framework to formalizing search control operators in logic programming...|$|R

40|$|Fluid {{dynamics}} is {{the universal}} theory of low-energy excitations around equilibrium states, governing {{the physics of}} long-lived modes associated with conserved charges. Historically, fluid dynamics has been formulated {{at the level of}} equations of motion, in terms of a local fluid velocity and thermodynamic quantities. In this thesis, we describe a new formulation of fluid dynamics in terms of a path integral, which systematically encodes the effects of thermal and quantum fluctuations. In our formulation, the dynamical degrees of freedom are Stuckelberg-type fields associated to the conserved quantities, which are subject to natural symmetry considerations, and the time evolution of the path integral is along the closed-time contour. Our formulation recovers the standard hydrodynamics, including the expected constraints from thermodynamics and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, as well as an additional non-linear generalization of the Onsager relations. We demonstrate an emergent supersymmetry in the "classical statistical" limit of our theory. For the non-linear fluid, the formalism is encoded in a non-trivial differential geometric structure, with a non vanishing torsion tensor required to recover the correct physics of the most general fluid.

40|$|One may {{write the}} Maxwell {{equations}} {{in terms of}} two gauge potentials, one electric and one magnetic, by demanding that their field strengths should be dual to each other. This requirement is the condition of twisted self-duality. It can be extended to p-forms in spacetime of D dimensions, and it survives {{the introduction of a}} variety of couplings among forms of different rank, and also to spinor and scalar fields, which emerge naturally from supergravity. In this paper we provide a systematic <b>derivation</b> of the <b>action</b> principle, whose equations of motion are the condition of twisted self-duality. The derivation starts from the standard Maxwell action, extended to include the aforementioned couplings, and proceeds via the Hamiltonian formalism through the resolution of Gauss' law. In the pure Maxwell case we recover in this way an action that had been postulated by other authors, through an ansatz based on an action given earlier by us for untwisted self-duality. Those authors also extended their ansatz to include Chern-Simons couplings. In that case, we find a different result. The derivation from the standard extended Maxwell action implies of course that the theory is Lorentz-invariant and can be locally coupled to gravity. Nevertherless we include a direct compact Hamiltonian proof of these properties, which is based on the surface-deformation algebra. The symmetry in the dependence of the action on the electric and magnetic variables is manifest, since they appear as canonical conjugates. Spacetime covariance, although present, is not manifest.

40|$|We review {{various ways}} {{to express the}} {{partition}} function of the single-band Hubard model as a path integral. The emphasis is made on the <b>derivation</b> of the <b>action</b> in the integrand of the path integral and the results obtained from this approach are discussed only briefly.   Since the single-band Hubbard model is a pure fermionic model on the lattice and its Hamiltonian is a polynomial in creation and annihilation fermionic operators, {{with the help of}} the fermionic coherent states of holomorphic representions the partition function of the model can be straightforwardly expressed as a path integral with respect to Grassmann fields. Then the question arises how to calculate this path integral specially in the most interesting case of the strong coupling, which is described by the term quartic in the fermion fields.   The standard way to get rid of this quartic term is to use so-called Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation by introducing auxilary boson field (this procedure is usually called bosonization). Since there are several equivalent forms of the interaction term in the single-band Hubbard model the bosonization procedure is not unique.   In the first section of the article we discuss two types of bosoniztions one with two real scalar fields (charge and spin fields) and another with a real vector field.   The second section is devoted to a spin-rotation-invariant bosonization procedure invented by Schulz and Weng, Ting and Lee, where an arbitary quantization axis is introduced at each point in space and time and an integration over all possible orientations enters the path integral measure. Spin rotation invariant formulation is necessary to study e. g. spiral magnetization.   In the third section we present the contstruction of a path integral for the partition function when the single-band Hubbard Hamiltonian is written in terms of the Hubbard operators, which are elements of the doubly graded semi-simple algebra. In this case one should use generalized coherent states for superalgebra in order to get a path integral formulation. We follow the procedure proposed recently by T ngler and Kopp, to investigate the case of strong coupling...|$|R
