40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} social phenomenon of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Recent high profile scandals {{have raised the}} profile of Corporate Social Responsibility {{and as a result}} organisations now spend significant time and resources attempting to manage it. The importance of CSR is well evidenced in this research however what CSR actually is and what constitutes successful CSR is a much more difficult question for employees to answer. Even the term CSR is problematic and lacks agreed definition. This thesis shows that this leads to uncertainty and it examines the ways that organisational members interpret the subject, so that it means something to employees and stakeholders, and it further demonstrates the factors underpinning a successful programme. Clear gaps exist in the perceptions of senior management, line managers and front line employees as to what CSR means or what its benefits might be, indeed some question if the subject is an area that organisations should be involved in at all. The only thing that there seems any agreement over is that Corporate Social Irresponsibility is probably bad for the organisation, bad for society and bad for the stakeholders. This thesis contributes to the sociology of knowledge in a number of interrelated ways, and it is the nexus of these interrelationships that develops the distinctive contribution. The thesis examines the way that a number of organisations operationalize the construct of CSR to create shared value for the communities that they serve. It analyses the evolution of the definitions in use by the organisations and how employees create a shared understanding of the value that is added by CSR. Importantly the research provides a framework for understanding the impact the CSR can have within an organisation and provides a management tool to categorize CSR activities and then allows managers to identify ways of using CSR in a more strategic way. The thesis employs a case study approach to three organisations that are constituted in different ways and are of different sizes. These organisations have been chosen as they reflect the differing structures that represent the full range of incorporated businesses {{with the exception of the}} niche area of <b>incorporated</b> <b>partnerships.</b> All three believe that values are an important element of their business model and organisational culture. It considers the impact of structure and constitution, and investigates the different approaches of a large local Cooperative, a specialist hybrid Co-operative and the standard investor owned firm (IOF) model of CSR. It draws conclusions as to similarities and differences between the models and identifies core drivers of success in CSR for the organisations, as interpreted by employees. The approach follows the method outlined in Hingley (2010) and Stake (1995) and can be seen as typical cases of this type (Yin 2003). The use of multiple cases give a richness of detail by allowing input from the widest cross section of staff by interviewing over 150 staff of varying positions and from the widest possible ranges of business units and regions until saturation of categories was reached. The cases are built using Grounded Theory (GT) – a method that gives a significantly more validity to the process than a simple case approach and mitigates many of the weaknesses identified in the Case Study method. For example the topic of sense making is an important element of the thesis as is the process of symbolic interactionism. These require a depth of analysis and rigour in their investigation that GT gives but that case study is unlikely to uncover Unlike much research in this field that examines the reputational benefit of CSR the thesis examines the definition of CSR viewed from an organisational perspective. It adds to the body of knowledge regarding ways that employees make sense of the construct and their perceptions of benefits of CSR. It examines the impact of structure and constitution of organisations and contributes to our understanding of how this impacts on the behaviours and culture of organisations – a central tenet of CSR. The importance of alignment between espoused and enacted values is demonstrated as is the role of leadership in creating the conditions for a culture that ensures values are the key driver of CSR. The research examines the factors perceived by staff to impact the credibility of CSR and makes a methodological contribution by using Grounded Theory to build case studies by applying the rigorous coding processes to the development of the frameworks that the cases are based on. Finally the research makes a significant practitioner contribution by introducing the CSR matrix – the tool by which managers can categorise their activities and identify the organisational capabilities that can be leveraged to create shared value...|$|E

50|$|The initial {{plan of the}} Caesars World/Riverboat Development <b>Incorporated</b> <b>partnership</b> was for {{the complex}} to cost $228 million, but by early 1998 the {{projected}} cost was raised to $275 million. They chose a site near Bridgeport, Indiana, an unincorporated town located immediately on the Harrison County side of the Harrison County/Floyd County border; the site is fifteen miles (24 km) southwest of Louisville, Kentucky (Kentucky's largest metropolis), and was selected after performing a study to determine the nearest accessible location (to the city) that would permit a riverboat casino to operate legally. Louisville officials attempted to delay the construction of Caesars Indiana, who wanted to protect the gambling revenue of Churchill Downs and other Kentucky horse racing interests. Environmental groups lodged similar complaints due to concerns regarding the potential negative impact of the proposed development on local air quality, waterways, and wildlife. The Caesars World/Riverboat Development <b>Incorporated</b> <b>partnership</b> had already spent $11 million on making necessary improvements to use the newly acquired property. A preliminary study by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in February 1998 determined that further environmental studies, which would have delayed {{the building of the}} necessary facilities for Caesars Indiana, were not necessary. However, the United States Army Corps of Engineers did caution the Caesars World/Riverboat Development <b>Incorporated</b> <b>partnership</b> to carefully consider the number of trees to be cleared and the impact on runoff water.|$|R

40|$|An <b>incorporated</b> limited <b>partnership</b> is defined, rather unhelpfully, in the Partnership Acts as "an <b>incorporated</b> limited <b>partnership</b> {{formed in}} {{accordance}} with [the Act]". 1 It might be better defined by reference to limited partnerships generally. A limited partnership is an association of persons carrying on business as partners where the liability {{of at least one}} of them is limited and the funds and business are managed by one or more general partners for the benefit of all of the partners collectively. 2 <b>Incorporated</b> limited <b>partnerships</b> could then be defined in those terms, but with the additional feature of incorporation, meaning that they also have a corporate identity, a separate legal personality and perpetual succession. Unlike limited liability companies though, they do not confer limited liability on all of their members; only the limited partners are protected. The general partners remain liable, without limit, for the debts and obligations of the <b>partnership.</b> <b>Incorporated</b> limited <b>partnerships</b> are currently available in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. 3 New Zealand has announced that it also intends to introduce a similar body with the same features and to make it available for similar purposes...|$|R

Like limited partnerships, they are comprised of at least one limited partner and at least one general partner. Limited partners {{are defined as}} persons or partnerships (including an external partnership) admitted and designated as a limited partner in the <b>incorporated</b> limited <b>partnership</b> {{in accordance with the}} partnership agreement. They are partners who contribute to the capital of the partnership but who do not take part in its management, who cannot bind the firm and whose liability to contribute to the debts or obligations of the partnership, or of a general partner, is generally limited to their agreed contribution of capital or property...|$|R

40|$|Open {{innovation}} in entrepreneurships already ﬁnds its acceptance {{at all levels}} of the business industry for adding value to the business. The value could be in the form of economic gain or enhancement of knowledge leading to a sustained ﬁnancial base. Open innovation adopts various strategies to accom- plish the task for enhancing the value gain. Varying by size, nature, pattern, or characteristics of the ﬁrm various strategies are being adopted by enterprises. Though largely known to be familiar in corporate business houses, in recent years open innovation is also becoming increasingly familiar in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the trend is rapidly increasing. However despite the potency of open innovation strategies, most of the enterprises are yet to ﬁnd a sustained business model, especially for the SMEs working at the periphery of that value chain. This forms the basis of the current study. This chapter is trying to formulate a business model <b>incorporating</b> <b>partnership</b> approach from academia, research houses, intermediaries, and other stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|The Venture Capital Act 2002 (Cth) {{was enacted}} to remove tax impediments to venture capital {{investment}} in Australia.

The passage of that legislation caused members of the venture capital industry to review the state of Australian limited partnership law and to make recommendations for its reform.

This article focuses upon the industry critique of the existing legislation, reform proposals, legislative outcomes {{and their impact on}} the broader field of partnership law, while placing limited partnership within a broader historical perspective.

40|$|Objectives: To better {{understand}} the applicability of knowledge management (KM) in public health (PH) as a strategy to improve planning and decision making. Design and Sample: The study {{was designed as a}} narrative inquiry; a form of storytelling research. Qualitative data were collected through interviews designed to gain participants stories about planning processes. Twenty-four participants from six PH Units in Ontario, Canada. Measures: We performed a secondary analysis to {{better understand}} the use of KM strategies, techniques, and approaches. Findings were compared to a preliminary KM framework supporting knowledge processes within a dynamic, interactive context. Results: Analysis showed that while KM strategies are supported informally, it is most often done in an ad hoc manner. Participants acknowledged a gap in their knowledge sharing practices. Conclusion: PH professionals are ready to apply KM in PH as an approach to facilitate planning and decision making. The proposed KM framework <b>incorporates</b> <b>partnerships</b> to adapt to the realities of PH context. Consideration of KM strategies can improve information organization, partnerships and decision making, as well as contribute to current PH reforms aimed at strengthening the health care system.
