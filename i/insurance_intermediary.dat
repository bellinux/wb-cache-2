5000|$|Case E-04/09 Inconsult {{dealt with}} the {{criteria}} an website had to comply with {{in order to be}} considered a “durable medium”, according to Article 2(12) of Directive 2002/92/EC on insurance mediation. The Court noted that for the purposes of consumer protection, the Directive sets out certain minimum obligations relating to the information which insurance intermediaries must provide to their customers {{and the manner in which}} this is done. By requiring this information to be submitted either on paper or any other durable medium, the Directive facilitates the subsequent verification of the information which an intermediary has provided to his customer. The Court held that a website can constitute a durable medium under Article 2(12) of the Directive, provided that several criteria are met. First, the website must enable the customer to store the information in question. Secondly, the website must enable the customer to store the information in a way which makes it accessible for a period of time adequate to the purposes of the information, that is, for as long as it is relevant for the customer in order to protect his interests stemming from his relations with the <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediary.</b> This might cover the time during which contractual negotiations were conducted even if not resulting in the conclusion of an insurance contract, the period during which an insurance contract is in force and, to the extent necessary e.g. for seeking redress, the period after such a contract has lapsed. Thirdly, the website must allow for the unchanged reproduction of information stored. In this respect, the Court held that the information must be stored in a way that makes it impossible for the <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediary</b> to change it unilaterally. It is for the <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediary</b> to ensure that the methods of electronic communication he employs permit this kind of reproduction. Finally, the Court held that for an website to qualify as a durable medium it is irrelevant whether the customer has expressly consented to the provision of information through the internet.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{a sample}} of 946 German <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediaries,</b> the factors that {{affect the quality of}} the {{information}} services provided by them are studied using OLS-estimations. Applying a search theoretical approach, we analyze the impact of supply and demand side variables on service quality. Besides, the working of signaling devices (like reputation, advertising or certificates) to reduce asymmetric information with respect to the service quality of <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediaries</b> is examined. The results obtained support the main hypotheses derived from industrial organization theories as to the poor working of quality competition under incomplete and asymmetric information on the side of consumers. Thus, public policy should concentrate on increasing transparency about intermediaries' (in-) dependence from insurance companies and improve consumers' financial literacy to raise the overall quality of the information services provided by <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediaries.</b> Performance of <b>Insurance</b> Distribution Systems, Information Quality...|$|R

However, competing <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediaries</b> provide heterogeneous services, which {{are difficult to}} assess by incompletely informed consumers.

The present paper uses a sample of 927 <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediaries</b> in Germany. By performing OLS estimations we test the impact of the different distribution channels, but also of other factors relating to the information processing activities on intermediaries’ service quality. Depending on the proxies used for service quality, we find mixed evidence for the “product quality” hypothesis according to which independent intermediaries provide better service quality than exclusive agents. We find that service quality depends also to a large extent on the information gathering and processing activities of the individual intermediaries. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} nature of the online competition between two types of online intermediaries, namely, online brokers and online agents. By exploring the price levels and price dispersion of premiums paid for term life insurance product, price data of online brokers and online agents are carefully compared. The investigation was conducted by a context and literature review, research objectives and methodology, data and result analysis, research limitations and significance. The data was collected from a price comparison website named moneysupermarket. com. In this dissertation, the author presented a detailed literature review about the popularity and significance of the Internet and e-commerce, theories about search costs and lowered prices which are related directly to the e-commerce, development and changes of the insurance distribution channel, functions of the intermediaries in the insurance market and the relationship between the Internet and online insurance transactions. By using the prices displayed on moneysupermarket. com, the author collected comparable price data from both online brokers and online agents. Through three regression analyses by SPSS, mean values and standard deviation values of the two groups were compared. The results showed {{the nature of}} the online competitions in different <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediary</b> markets. The competition among online brokers who sell insurance products at an average lower price seems to be more intensive than the competition among online agents who sell homogeneous insurance products at an average higher price. Possible explanations for the differences were then brought forward. At last, this dissertation concludes with the limitations and achievements throughout the dissertation time and pointed out some reasonable directions for future studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{insurance}} industry discharges {{a critical role}} in the Australian economy and is {{a significant part of the}} Australian financial services market. The industry relies upon intermediaries, the principal types being brokers and agents, to promote, arrange and distribute their products and services in the market. The pivotal role that they play in this context and sensitivities associated with the consumer oriented products, such as house and contents insurance, has ensured close regulatory attention. Of particular importance was the passage of the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 (Cth), a comprehensive attempt to address the responsibilities of intermediaries as well as particular problem areas associated with the handling of money. However, with the introduction of financial services and market reform early in the new millennium this <b>insurance</b> <b>intermediary</b> specific regulatory approach was abandoned in favour of a market-wide strategy; that is, market reform was based upon across-the-board licensing, disclosure, conduct and fairness standards, and all financial products and services are now regulated at a generic level under Ch 7 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). This article briefly explores the categories of insurance intermediaries and the relevant distinctions between them but focuses mainly upon the regulatory context in which they operate. This context transcends a strictly legal framework as the regulatory body, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), has sought to inform and guide the market through Policy Statements and Regulatory Guides. The usefulness of these guides as an adjunct to the legislation in explaining the scope and operation of regulatory framework is examined. In addition, the article looks at the self-regulatory and dispute resolution practices in this area and their impact. In conclusion an assessment of this across-the-board regulatory regime is advanced...|$|E
