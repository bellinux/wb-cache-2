60|$|It {{was when}} a solid shot struck {{the corner of}} the cabin near to the ridge-pole, just above where Abel Hunt lay, and plowed its way through the solid logs, tearing them aside as a child might shatter a lot of <b>jackstraws,</b> that I {{believed}} we were soon to meet our death. Hunt must have been of the same opinion, for he begged like a cur, when Pierre and I went up shortly afterward, for us to keep the gag from his mouth, declaring that we were striving to compass his death by leaving him in such a place.|$|E

40|$|Kaidun is breccia of {{disparate}} enstatite and carbonaceous chondrite clasts, {{and continues to}} provide real surprises. Many Daidun clasts have been intensely altered by an aqueous fluid, {{as evidenced by the}} widespread occurrence of ferromagnesian phyllosilicates and presence of carbonate- and phyllosilicate-filled veins.

50|$|The orebody {{itself is}} {{composed}} of 2 to 6 metres of massive nickeliferous sulfides, usually banded and foliated pentlandite-pyrrhotite-pyrite. Dodecahedral pyrite crystals to 20 cm are formed within the massive sulfide zones. The massive zone is overlain by a matrix ore zone composed of the above sulfide assemblage and coarse <b>jackstraw</b> textured bladed olivine, now retrogressed to black serpentinite. This is in turn overlain by stringy-beef textured recrystallised disseminated ore zones containing retrogressed metamorphic olivine and distinctive bladed anthophyllite.|$|R
2500|$|Net-textured sulfides [...] (Canada) or matrix sulfides (Australia) are {{composed}} of 30-50% sulfide interstitial to olivine (typically serpentinized), which have been interpreted to have formed by static gravitational segregation, dynamic flow segregation, or capillary infiltration. This texture is well preserved in many areas (e.g., Alexo, Ontario; Kambalda, Western Australia; Raglan, New Quebec), but in high-grade metamorphic areas it has been replaced <b>jackstraw</b> texture, composed of bladed to acicular metamorphic olivines, which superficially resembles spinifex textured olivines, within a matrix of Fe-Ni-Cu sulfides.|$|R

Once you've started to remove a jackstraw, you can't change your mind and decide to remove another. If, at any time, you wish to use your fingers instead of the hook, you may do so.|$|E
50|$|On November 18, 1717, Westborough was {{incorporated}} as the hundredth town in Massachusetts, populated by twenty-seven families, including Thomas Rice who had represented Marlborough in the Great and General Court. Soon large farms were carved out, mills built along the Assabet River and <b>Jackstraw</b> Brook, and taverns flourished. Westborough's first minister, Reverend Ebenezer Parkman, shepherded the growing town of colonists {{through the years}} toward independence from Great Britain. Forty-six minutemen from Westborough fought under Captain Edmund Brigham in the Revolutionary War.|$|R

They inform him that a massive military mobilization has happened to locate the crashed plane and that it carried something very important. The government, having refused to divulge anything, had tried to contact Mason's station. Finding the station to be non-responding, they have requested the expedition chief, Captain Hillcrest, to investigate.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) is an {{important}} tree species in the western United States {{and there has been}} much concern about its persistence. In this thesis, I report on aspen in a portion of its range that has not been previously evaluated: the eastern and western slopes of the Central Oregon Cascades and the Willamette Valley. My primary research objectives {{for each of the three}} landscapes were to: (1) assess aspen overstory recruitment across time; (2) assess the condition of aspen sprouts; (3) identify environmental and biological stressors to the aspen overstory and understory; and (4) test the aspen overstory, recent recruitment, and sprouts for correlations to ungulate herbivory and conifer encroachment. In addition, on the eastern slope of the Cascades, I tested the efficacy of piles of coarse woody debris (CWD) or <b>jackstraw</b> as an herbivore deterrent. On the east side of the Cascade Mountains, aspen stands were small (â‰¤ 0. 6 ha) and found in a dense conifer matrix. Small stands are expected to recruit overstory across time and expand with disturbance events. Aspen stands on the east side showed a steady decline in overstory recruitment that coincided with increase in conifer encroachment and ungulate herbivory. Aspen stands with conifer mortality attributable to mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), and subsequent release of overstory competition and formation of <b>jackstraw,</b> recruited overstory trees at expected levels.

5000|$|Extensive {{stands of}} [...] "ghost forest" [...] and <b>jackstrawed</b> trees are still {{conspicuous}} throughout Sierra Nevada. Annual monitoring of lodgepole needle miner density began in 1966, and 28 permanent plots are scattered {{north of the}} Cathedral Range. The current outbreak began in 1973 and has been sweeping around {{the south side of}} the Cathedral Range, arriving at Sunrise High Sierra Camp in 2001. The Ghost Forest which was evident at the crest between Tenaya Lake and Tuolumne Meadows in the late 1970s was noticeably reforested by 2000. Lodgepole needle miner defoliation currently extends over approximately 40,000 acre, with nearly 10,000 acre of low to high mortality each year.|$|R
50|$|The Buffalo Bill Gun was {{the most}} popular toy the company had {{produced}} to date. Appearing in 1884, it was immediately sold out and the Company could not keep up with the re-orders. Company space was enlarged for this high demand of Buffalo Bill Guns, yet the production could still barely keep up with the demand. The expansion of the factory allowed the Company to produce other products {{that would not have been}} possible before expansion, such as the lawn game Enchantment, Pitch-a-Ring, Ring Toss, or <b>Jackstraws.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{pieces in}} a jackstraw set are often thematically related to {{farmyard}} tools, such as ladders, rakes, shovels, and hoes. There are typically around 45 pieces {{in a set}} and made of wood, plastic, bone, or ivory. In addition to the <b>jackstraws</b> themselves, the game typically includes a helper piece with a hooked edge to help people grasp and manipulate pieces. Each piece in the game also has a point value, with more challenging pieces being worth more points {{at the end of}} the game.|$|E
5000|$|Pick-up sticks or pick-a-stick {{is a game}} of {{physical}} and mental skill in which a bundle of [...] "sticks", between 8 and 20 centimeters long, are dropped as a loose bunch onto a table top, jumbling into a random pile. Each player in turn tries to remove a stick from the pile without disturbing any of the others. The game has several versions such as <b>Jackstraws</b> (or Jack Straws), Spellicans, and Spillikins, and appears {{in a line of}} a nursery rhyme: [...] "...five, six, pick-up sticks!" ...|$|E

He had the {{opportunity}} to play this instrument at the tenth Biennial event of Paris in 1977 at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris. This electroacoustic lyre consists of 18 strings and at least two micro-sensors for each of the strings. By 2010, he had successfully designed four harmonic lyres, 3 glass guitars of PMMA and carbon fiber neck, [...] "water drums" [...] for John Cage's creation with the [...] " [...] percussions of Strasbourg" [...] (1989), as well as various other original instruments which include musical wind mills, wind chimes, kalimbÃ©, musical <b>jackstraw</b> in bamboo for children, musical boomerangs,an acoustic game of bowls, and so on.|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, Eliza Rickman {{announced}} {{that she would be}} releasing her second full-length LP, entitled Footnotes for the Spring. Since the recording and release of O, You Sinners, Rickman had undergone a great deal of stress and anxiety, resulting in health and neurological issues, from perpetually living on the road, as well as being in an abusive relationship, and misogyny from venue managers and audience members. Footnotes for the Spring was originally intended to be about the [...] American South, but owing to her experiences over the previous few years, the albumâ€™s content came to reflect more her life experiences. Footnotes for the Spring was primarily recorded and arranged by Jason Webley in his studio in Everett, Washington, though much of the piano material was recorded at The <b>Jackstraw</b> Cultural Center in Seattle. The album was officially released on October 20th, 2015.|$|R
50|$|Mason {{decides to}} go on with the journey since any attempt to return will induce the murderers to act. He keeps this new {{development}} to himself and <b>Jackstraw.</b> Hillcrest sets out after the group but soon finds that the petrol he picked up at the station has been tampered with. Sugar has been added to the petrol causing the sugar to melt and stick to the engine parts leading him to get bogged down. A solution is found to this when one of the passengers, a chemist, suggests that the petrol be mixed with water and the top layer of the resultant mixture be siphoned off. Almost at the same time, the government also relents and informs Mason through Hillcrest that the military courier carried a top secret missile guidance mechanism disguised as a tape recorder. Mason realizes that one of the passengers picked up such a device at the crash site. This precipitates the murderers into action and they take over the group.|$|R
