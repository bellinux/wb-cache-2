They first investigated the possibilities that the sounds were due to equipment malfunction, geophysical phenomena, or even part of a Soviet Union scheme for detecting enemy submarines. Eventually, biologists demonstrated that the sounds were the vocalizations of fin whales.|$|E

Szwarc was contacted one night and told that his island was drifting towards Cuba. Real hammerhead sharks circled the teen actors during the filming of one shot.

5|$|As Neerja boards Pan Am 73, it is {{revealed}} that the Abu Nidal organization, a Libyan-sponsored terrorist group, plans to hijack the plane in Karachi. The plane takes off from Mumbai's Sahar International Airport and lands in Karachi, where the four Abu Nidal terrorists, disguised as security officers escorting a Libyan diplomat, hijack the plane. Neerja quickly alerts the cockpit, and the three American pilots escape through the overhead hatch, fleeing to the terminal under fire from the hijackers. The American pilots had {{just enough time to}} escape, as the hijackers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the cockpit of a Boeing 747 is located upstairs.|$|E

5|$|In September 1969, Cheyenne {{prototype}} #10 (s/n 66-8835) underwent {{wind tunnel}} testing at NASA Ames Research Center, {{to research the}} half-P hop and drag issues. The engineers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the fixed mounts used to secure the aircraft in the wind tunnel would not allow the helicopter to move relative to the rotor, {{as it did in}} flight. As a result, there was no natural damping of the rotor pitching motion. The remote controllers' lack of sensory feedback from helicopter compounded the situation. During high speed testing to replicate the half-P hop vibration, the rotor oscillations quickly accelerated out of control and struck the tail boom, resulting in the destructive breakup of the helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Minton <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> Frank {{was also}} {{president}} of the University of Wisconsin, and soon suffered retaliation {{for the way he}} had treated Frank. Frank went on NBC radio stations around the country and lambasted Minton for his rudeness. He made lengthy arguments accusing Minton of attempting to violate the Bill of Rights. Minton was outraged, but the arguments had an effect among voters in Indiana. In 1938, he sought funding to launch a massive nationwide investigation of media conglomerates for proof of Republican interference in the press. Democratic Senator Edward R. Burke led an effort to defeat the measure and privately accused Minton of damaging the Democrats' cause, which led Minton to leave the Lobby Investigation Committee.|$|E
5|$|One {{thousand}} {{years before the}} events in the game, on a floating continent hovering high above the surface of an unnamed planet, a technologically advanced civilization sought to harness the power of the four elemental crystals of light. They <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> they could not control such fundamental forces of nature. This power of light would have consumed the world itself had the light crystals not had their natural counterparts: the four dark elemental crystals. Disturbed by the sudden interruption of the careful balance between light and dark, four warriors were granted the power of the dark crystals to recapture the power of the light crystals. These so-called Dark Warriors succeeded in their quest, and restored harmony to the world. But their victory came too late to save the doomed civilization, whose culture was reduced to ruin, though their floating continent remained. On that continent, the circle of Gulgans, a race of blind soothsayers and fortune-tellers, predicted that these events will ultimately repeat.|$|E

5|$|Raven Forward Air Controllers at Lima Site 20A, {{being the}} nearest {{available}} American support, were {{awakened by a}} radio call about 04:00. They flew in the dark to Lima Strip 36 at Na Khang to position themselves at the airstrip closest to LS85. The Ravens took up station over LS85 at dawn. At 05:15 Sullivan, from the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane, decided to evacuate Lima Site 85 and he gave a signal to U.S. pilots at Udorn to begin the operation, which was due to start at 07:15. However, Sullivan <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> U.S. technicians were no longer {{in control of their}} TSQ-81 equipment. Starting around 06:00, Pao's Hmong soldiers launched a counterattack against North Vietnamese positions at the communication center, which was guarded by Cells 1 and 2, but their attacks were repelled and the North Vietnamese held their positions. With the final Hmong counterattack on the communication site was defeated at 06:25, Cell 2 was ordered to support Cells 3 and 5 in their fight at the main TACAN installation. By 06:35, the North Vietnamese fully controlled the TACAN site. At the airstrip, Cell 4 was encircled by an estimated two Hmong platoons, but Chom and his unit were able to fight their way out by taking full advantage of rough terrain which favored them. Later, Cell 4 linked up with other units at the TACAN site.|$|E

25|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} a heretic once asked Rabbi Akiva {{who created the}} world. Rabbi Akiva {{answered}} that God had. The heretic demanded that Rabbi Akiva give him clear proof. Rabbi Akiva {{asked him what he}} was wearing. The heretic said that it was a garment. Rabbi Akiva asked him who made it. The heretic replied that a weaver had. Rabbi Akiva demanded that the heretic give him proof. The heretic asked Rabbi Akiva whether he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> a garment is made by a weaver. Rabbi Akiva replied by asking the heretic whether he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the world was made by God. When the heretic had left, Rabbi Akiva's disciples asked him to explain his proof. Rabbi Akiva replied that just as a house implies a builder, a dress implies a weaver, and a door implies a carpenter, so the world proclaims the God who created it.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Monmouth on 28 June 1778, Charles Lee led the 5,000-man American {{advance guard}} to attack Sir Henry Clinton's British army.

Consequently, he mishandled his troops on the field. Washington arrived with the army's main body to find Lee's advance guard in full retreat {{in the face of}} Clinton's counterattack. He quickly set up a holding position and rode back to organize the main line of defense.|$|E

Chopin was already ill with incipient tuberculosis (or, as has recently been suggested, cystic fibrosis) {{at the beginning of}} their relationship, and spending a winter in Majorcaâ€”where Sand and Chopin <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> winter was a time of rain and cold, and where they could not get proper lodgingsâ€”exacerbated his symptoms.

25|$|While in Paris, Rorimer had an auspicious {{encounter}} with Rose Valland, {{an art historian}} and employee of the Galerie Nationale du Jeu de Paume.

25|$|Two Confederate blunders aided Rosecrans. Breckinridge, on {{the east}} side of the river, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> Crittenden's early morning attack had been withdrawn. He refused to send two brigades as {{reinforcements}} across the river to aid the main attack on the left. When Bragg ordered him to attack to his frontâ€”so that some use could be made of his corpsâ€”Breckinridge moved forward and was embarrassed to find out that there were no Union troops opposing him. At about that time, Bragg received a false report that a strong Union force was moving south along the Lebanon Turnpike in his direction. He canceled his orders that Breckinridge send reinforcements across the river, which diluted the effectiveness of the main attack.|$|E
25|$|On 3 February, Napoleon's army reached Troyes after {{completely}} {{breaking contact}} with the Allies the previous day. On 4 February, Schwarzenberg wrote his colleague BlÃ¼cher that he was moving farther south in order to turn Napoleon's right flank. The next day, Russian General Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly ordered Alexander Nikitich Seslavin's scouting force from Schwarzenberg's right flank to the left flank without notifying BlÃ¼cher. Since the Prussian field marshal {{did not have a}} liaison officer with Seslavin's force he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> no one was watching for French forces in the space on his left flank.

Under heavy pressure, the New Yorkers were forced back to occupy a traversing trench that Greene had engineered facing south. They essentially held their ground and protected the flank, but they lost almost a third of their men in doing so.
