25|$|The breast is {{susceptible}} to numerous benign and malignant conditions. The most frequent benign conditions are puerperal mastitis, fibrocystic breast changes and mastalgia. Lactation unrelated to pregnancy can occur as <b>galactorrhea</b> (spontaneous milk flow) from the adverse effects of drugs (e.g. antipsychotic medications), extreme physical stress, or endocrine disorders. In a newborn infant, the capability of lactation {{is a consequence of}} the mother's circulating hormones (prolactin, oxytocin, etc.) in his or her blood stream, which were introduced by the shared circulatory system of the placenta.|$|E
25|$|A {{doctor will}} test for {{prolactin}} blood levels {{in women with}} unexplained milk secretion (<b>galactorrhea)</b> or irregular menses or infertility, and in men with impaired sexual function and, in rare cases, milk secretion. If prolactin is high, a doctor will test thyroid function and ask first about other conditions and medications known to raise prolactin secretion. The doctor will also request a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), {{which is the most}} sensitive test for detecting pituitary tumors and determining their size. MRI scans may be repeated periodically to assess tumor progression and the effects of therapy. Computed Tomography (CT scan) also gives an image of the pituitary, but it is less sensitive than the MRI.|$|E
2500|$|Unintended {{milk flow}} (<b>galactorrhea)</b> is often caused by nipple {{stimulation}} {{and it is}} possible to reach normal milk production exclusively by suckling on the breast. [...] Nipple stimulation of any sort is noted in reducing the incidence of breast cancer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Galactorrhea</b> is {{reported}} to occur in 5-32% of women. Much {{of the difference in}} reported incidence can be attributed to different definitions of <b>galactorrhea.</b> Although frequently benign, it may be caused by serious underlying conditions and should be properly investigated. <b>Galactorrhea</b> also occurs in males, newborn infants and adolescents of both sexes.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms of <b>galactorrhea</b> hyper{{prolactin}}emia {{include a}} high blood prolactin level, abnormal milk {{production in the}} breast, <b>galactorrhea,</b> menstrual abnormalities, reduced libido, reduced fertility, puberty problems, and headaches.|$|E
50|$|<b>Galactorrhea</b> {{is also a}} {{side effect}} {{associated}} with the use of the second-generation H2 receptor antagonist cimetidine (Tagamet). <b>Galactorrhea</b> can also be caused by antipsychotics that cause hyperprolactinemia by blocking dopamine receptors responsible for control of prolactin release. Of these, risperidone is the most notorious for causing this complication. Case reports suggest proton-pump inhibitors have been shown to cause <b>galactorrhea.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Galactorrhea</b> {{can take}} place {{as a result of}} dysregulation of certain hormones. Hormonal causes most {{frequently}} associated with <b>galactorrhea</b> are hyperprolactinemia and thyroid conditions with elevated levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). No obvious cause is found in about 50% of cases.|$|E

50|$|<b>Galactorrhea</b> hyperprolactinemia is {{increased}} blood prolactin levels associated with <b>galactorrhea</b> (abnormal milk secretion). It {{may be caused}} by such things as certain medications, pituitary disorders and thyroid disorders. The condition can occur in males as well as females. Relatively common etiologies include prolactinoma, medication effect, kidney failure, granulomatous diseases of the pituitary gland, and disorders which interfere with the hypothalamic inhibition of prolactin release. Ectopic (non-pituitary) production of prolactin may also occur. <b>Galactorrhea</b> hyperprolactinemia is listed as a “rare disease” by the Office of Rare Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. This means that it affects less than 200,000 people in the United States population.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Galactorrhea</b> (also spelled galactorrhoea) ( [...] + [...] ) or lactorrhea ( [...] + [...] ) is the {{spontaneous}} flow of milk from the breast, unassociated with childbirth or nursing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Galactorrhea</b> is milk {{production}} unrelated to nursing. It {{can occur in}} males and females of many mammal species as result of hormonal imbalances such as hyperprolactinaemia.|$|E
50|$|Rare {{accounts}} of male lactation (as distinct from <b>galactorrhea)</b> exist in historical medical and anthropological literature, although the phenomenon {{has not been}} confirmed by more recent literature.|$|E

50|$|The {{phenomenon}} of successful human male breastfeeding has been credibly observed in several cases. However, {{the cases are}} not sufficiently documented to allow distinguishing of possible pathologic <b>galactorrhea.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pituitary tumors {{occur in}} 15 to 42% of MEN 1 patients. From 25 to 90% are prolactinomas. About 25% of {{pituitary}} tumors secrete growth hormone or growth hormone and prolactin. Excess prolactin may cause <b>galactorrhea</b> (see Pituitary Disorders: <b>Galactorrhea),</b> and excess growth hormone causes acromegaly clinically indistinguishable from sporadically occurring acromegaly. About 3% of tumors secrete ACTH, producing Cushing's disease. Most {{of the remainder}} are nonfunctional. Local tumor expansion may cause visual disturbance, headache, and hypopituitarism. Pituitary tumors in MEN 1 patients appear to be larger and behave more aggressively than sporadic pituitary tumors.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{are some of the}} possible medical causes of <b>galactorrhea</b> hyperprolactinemia that are listed by the Diseases Database: pregnancy, breastfeeding, sexual intercourse, shingles, prolactin secreting pituitary tumor, along with many others.|$|E
50|$|Lactation {{requires}} {{the presence of}} prolactin, and the evaluation of <b>galactorrhea</b> includes eliciting a history for various medications or foods (methyldopa, opioids, antipsychotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, as well as licorice) and for behavioral causes (stress, and breast and chest wall stimulation), as well as evaluation for pregnancy, pituitary adenomas (with overproduction of prolactin or compression of the pituitary stalk), and hypothyroidism. Adenomas of the anterior pituitary are most often prolactinomas. Overproduction of prolactin leads to cessation of menstrual periods and infertility, which may be a diagnostic clue. <b>Galactorrhea</b> may also be caused by hormonal imbalances owing to birth control pills.|$|E
50|$|Due to D2 {{receptor}} blockade, domperidone causes hyperprolactinemia. Hyperprolactinemia can {{suppress the}} secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, in turn suppressing the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and resulting in hypogonadism (low sex hormone (e.g., testosterone, estradiol) levels). As such, male patients may experience low libido, erectile dysfunction, and impaired spermatogenesis. Also {{in accordance with}} hyperprolactinemia, 10-15% of female patients {{have been reported to}} experience mammoplasia (breast enlargement), mastodynia (breast pain/tenderness), <b>galactorrhea</b> (inappropriate or excessive milk production/secretion), and amenorrhea (cessation of menstrual cycles) with domperidone treatment. Gynecomastia has been reported in males treated with domperidone, and <b>galactorrhea</b> could occur in males as well.|$|E
5000|$|Gynecological: {{changes in}} vaginal bleeding, dysmenorrhea, {{increase}} in size of uterine leiomyomata, vaginitis including vaginal candidiasis, changes in cervical secretion and cervical ectropion, ovarian cancer, endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial cancer, nipple discharge, <b>galactorrhea,</b> fibrocystic breast changes and breast cancer.|$|E
50|$|The term male {{lactation}} is {{not used}} in human medicine. It {{has been used in}} popular literature, such as Louise Erdrich's The Antelope Wife, to describe the phenomenon of male <b>galactorrhea</b> which is a well documented condition in humans.|$|E
50|$|Unintended {{milk flow}} (<b>galactorrhea)</b> is often caused by nipple {{stimulation}} {{and it is}} possible to reach normal milk production exclusively by suckling on the breast. Nipple stimulation of any sort is noted in reducing the incidence of breast cancer.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{side-effects}} of itopride include {{mild to moderate}} abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Some other side effects that may occur include: rash, giddiness, exhaustion, back or chest pain, increased salivation, constipation, headache, sleeping disorders, dizziness, <b>galactorrhea,</b> and gynecomastia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Galactorrhea</b> is {{generally}} considered a symptom which may indicate a more serious problem. Collection of a thorough medical history, including pregnancies, surgeries, and consumption of drugs and medications {{is a first step}} in diagnosing the cause of <b>galactorrhea.</b> A physical examination, along with a breast examination, will usually be conducted. Blood and urine samples may be taken to determine levels of various hormones in the body, including prolactin and compounds related to thyroid function. A mammogram (an X-ray of the breast) or an ultrasound scan (using high frequency sound waves) might be used to determine if there are any tumors or cysts present in the breasts themselves. If a tumor of the pituitary gland is suspected, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan can locate tumors or abnormalities in tissues.|$|E
50|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (ADRs) {{associated with}} metoclopramide therapy include restlessness (akathisia), and focal dystonia. Infrequent ADRs include hypertension, hypotension, hyperprolactinaemia leading to <b>galactorrhea,</b> constipation, depression, headache, and extrapyramidal effects such as oculogyric crisis. Rare but serious ADRs associated with metoclopramide therapy include agranulocytosis, supraventricular tachycardia, hyperaldosteronism, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, akathisia and tardive dyskinesia.|$|E
50|$|Prolactin is a {{peptide hormone}} {{produced}} by the anterior pituitary gland that is primarily associated with lactation and plays {{a vital role in}} breast development during pregnancy. Hyperprolactinaemia may cause <b>galactorrhea</b> (production and spontaneous flow of breast milk) and disruptions in the normal menstrual period in women and hypogonadism, infertility and erectile dysfunction in men.|$|E
50|$|Rarely (≥0.01% to <0.1%) {{reported}} {{adverse reaction}} includes excitation, headache, paresthesia {{especially in elderly}} patients, restlessness, sweating, sleep disturbances, edema, <b>galactorrhea,</b> urine blockage, nausea and vomiting, collapse conditions, stimulation conducting disturbances, intensification of present heart insufficiency, blood profile changes particularly leukopenia, confusion, delirium, stomach complaints, taste disturbance, and paralytic ileus especially with sudden discontinuation of a longer-term high-dose therapy.|$|E
