40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} instabilities of thin liquid films up to entrainment of drops. Four types of instabilities have been classified {{depending on the}} type of structure and process on the liquid film surface: two-dimensional slow waves, two-dimensional fast waves, three-dimensional waves, solitary waves and entrainment of drops from the film surface. This thesis analyzes the physical principles of instabilities and deals with the mathematical formulation of the problem. Shear and pressure forces acting on the surface of the liquid film are identified as the cause of instabilities. Mathematical models for predicting instabilities are demonstrated using approaches based on solving the Orr-Sommerfeld equation and the equations of motion in integral form. Models of shear and pressure forces acting on the surface of the film and selected models of film thickness are presented. The work is focused on the prediction of the initiation of two-dimensional waves using the integral approach. Shear stress and pressure forces acting on the liquid film surface have been modeled using the simulation of air flow over a solid surface. Finally, criteria for <b>drop</b> <b>entrainment</b> are presented with their dependence on air velocity and film thickness...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis aims to investigate experimentally and theoretically the transition from stratified to non-stratified horizontal oil-water flows and to improve {{the understanding of the}} dual continuous pattern, where both phases retain their continuity at {{the top and bottom of}} the pipe respectively but there is dispersion of one phase into the other. Two experimental facilities were used in this study; a 38 mm ID stainless steel test section in a pilot scale flow facility and a 14 mm ID acrylic test section in a small flow facility running with water and oil (5. 5 mPa s viscosity and 828 kg/m 3 density) as test fluids. A high speed video camera was employed to examine wave characteristics and flow development, capture mechanism of drop formation and determine the onset conditions of <b>drop</b> <b>entrainment</b> and the dual continuous pattern in both facilities. In the 38 mm ID test section, a conductivity probe was also used to investigate wave structures before and at the onset of entrainment. A high frequency impedance probe was used to find the phase distribution of the oil-water flow while the local drop velocity and chord length distributions were measured using a dual impedance probe. In the 14 mm ID test section, the influence of adding polymer in horizontal oil-water flows was also investigated. While the flow pattern map developed by Lovick and Angeli (2004 a) was used for the 38 mm ID test section, a new flow pattern map was constructed for the 14 mm ID pipe. Dual continuous flow was found to occur for a smaller range of superficial velocities in the small test section compared to the large one. Visual observations from the two test sections revealed that no drops are formed when interfacial waves are absent. In addition annular flow with oil flowing at the core was observed in both pipes for low oil velocities and relatively high water velocities. The results from the high speed pictures and the conductivity probe showed that the amplitudes of the waves are increased as the superficial velocities of the two phases increase and as a result the required superficial water velocity,Usw,for the onset of entrainment decreases as the superficial oil velocity, Uso, increases. The model suggested by Trallero (1995) for the transition from stratified to non-stratified flow failed to predict the experimental results. Moreover, the high speed video images and the conductivity probe results showed that the amplitudes of the waves found at 2 m from the inlet are smaller than those observed at 7 m. When drops and the onset of entrainment were observed at 7 m from the inlet, these were not observed at 2 m from the inlet, which means that all drops forming downstream the pipe resulted from the waves. In the large pipe, the presence of a bend after the inlet section (T junction) resulted in larger drops than when no bend was present (Y junction). The high speed images also revealed that drops formed as a result of the relative movement between the oil and water phases. The faster phase will undercut the other one until a drop is detached from the wave crest. The entrained fractions during dual continuous flow, or the fraction of one phase dispersed into the continuum of the other were calculated from the phase distribution data obtained with both inlet configurations (T junction and bend and Y -junction). The entrained fraction of water in oil (Ew/o) increased as the input water flow rates increased at constant superficial oil velocity. Similarly, the entrained fraction of oil in water (Eo/w) increased as the oil flow rates increased at a constant water superficial velocity. Moreover, the entrained fractions when the bend was used were higher than those obtained without it. From the chord length measurements in dual continuous flow, chord length and drop concentration were found to decrease with increasing distance from the interface while the number density of large drops decreased as Usw increased at each Uso. Also, oil drops were in general larger than water drops. Drop velocity measurements also revealed that water drops were faster than the velocity of the upper layer while oil drops could be either slower or faster than the velocity of the lower layer. The results showed that average chord length L 32 was almost constant for the oil drops while it tended to decrease for the water drops as the respective layer velocity increased. In the 14 mm ID pipe, the addition of a polymer in the oil-water flow had a significant effect on the flow patterns and pressure drop. The transition from stratified to nonstratified patterns was clearly delayed and the pressure drop was found to decrease after adding the polymer. The wavy interface in the stratified, dual continuous and annular flows was damped when polymer was present. The interfacial and water wall shear stress were also found to decrease after the addition of the polymer. Theoretically a model was developed based on Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability to predict whether waves in stratified wavy flow with certain amplitudes and lengths are stable or not. The model compared well with the Viscous KH correlation developed by Trallero (1995) and with some experimental results. The model was extended to predict the onset velocities of entrainment by including an empirical wave amplitude and length. The prediction agreed well with the experimental onset velocities from a number of studies. Based on a balance between drag force and surface tension on the crests of the waves, another equation was developed to predict the critical wave amplitude and length required for drop formation. This equation was used together with the stability equation to define three regions in a wave amplitude against length graph. These are; stable wave region; unstable wave region, where waves are unstable but drops may not form because waves need to grow more before drops can detach; <b>drop</b> <b>entrainment</b> region. The model agreed well with the experimental results. Finally, an entrainment model to predict the fraction of one phase entrained into the other during dual continuous flow, that was based on a balance between rate of <b>drop</b> <b>entrainment</b> and rate of drop deposition. The model was modified with experimental data from the current study and was then validated against data from literature. The comparison was reasonable in many cases.

40|$|Abstract. Distillation {{column of}} special {{materials}} having high viscosity or containing solid particles, etc in chemical and petrochemical process is studied in this paper. Packed-column {{does not fit}} into this situation and even in a plate column, because of high flow resistance on the plate; it will cause some problems, such as blocking, flooding and shutting down. Here the hydrodynamic performance of flow-guided fixed valve trays (FFVT) is introduced and its hydrodynamic performance has been experimentally studied. With flow-guided holes and trapezoid fixed valves to transfer momentum of the gas bursting forth in a horizontal way to the liquid, the flow on the FFVT is well-proportioned and stable. The hydrodynamic data have been correlated and equations have been obtained for the pressure <b>drop,</b> the <b>entrainment</b> and the gas velocity at weeping point, {{which can be used}} for the design of FFVT...|$|R
40|$|New {{experimental}} data was obtained for pressure <b>drop</b> and <b>entrainment</b> for annular up-flow in a vertical pipe. The 9. 5 mm. pipe has an L/D ratio of 440 to insure fully developed annular flow. The pressure ranged from 140 kPa to 660 kPa. Therefore the density ratio was varied {{by a factor}} of four approximately. This allows the investigation of the effect of pressure on the interfacial shear models. Gas superficial velocities between 25 and 126 m/s were tested. This extends the range of previous data to higher gas velocities. The data were compared with well known models for interfacial shear that represent the state of the art. Good results were obtained when the model by Asali, Hanratty and Andreussi was modified for the effect of pressure. Furthermore an equivalent model was obtained based on the mixing length theory for rough pipes. It correlates the equivalent roughness to the film thickness...|$|R
40|$|The flow-guided sieve-valve tray(FGS-VT) {{with high}} {{efficiency}} {{was designed to}} overcome the shortcoming of low operating flexibility of the flow-guided sieve tray. Its dimensions and geometry, as well as structure characteristics, were presented. The hydrodynamics and mass transfer performance, including dry-plate pressure drop, wet plate-pressure <b>drop,</b> weeping, <b>entrainment</b> and tray efficiency, of two types of FGS-VTs (FGS-VTs with 14 and 8 valves, respectively) and one flow-guided sieve tray were tested in an air-water-oxygen cold model experiment with a 0. 6 m diameter plexiglass column. The results demonstrate that FGS-VT with 14 valves works better than FGS-VT with 8 valves, and {{in comparison with the}} flow-guided sieve tray, the flow-guided sieve-valve tray with 14 valves has higher tray efficiency, bigger operating flexibility, and lower wet-plate pressure drop (when all the valves are opened fully). Additionally, two typical applications to separate the mixture with high viscosity, solid, powder, easy-to-foam or easy self-polymerization components proved the unique advantages of FGS-VT...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{detailed}} {{study on the}} spray local flow and flame structure has been performed by means of PIV and laser-sheet LIF techniques under Diesel spray conditions. Operating conditions were based on Engine Combustion Network recommendations. A consistent comparison of inert and reacting axial velocity fields has produced quantitative information {{on the effect of}} heat release on the local flow. Local axial velocity has been shown to increase 50 to 60 % compared to the inert case, while the combustion-induced radial expansion of the spray has been quantified in terms of a 0. 9 to 2. 1 mm radius increase. As a result, the <b>drop</b> in <b>entrainment</b> rate has been quantified around 25 % compared to the inert case. Streamline analysis also hints at a reduced entrainment under reacting conditions. A 1 D spray model under reacting condition has been used, which confirms the modifications obtained in the main flow metrics when moving from inert to reacting conditions. When comparing the flow evolution with the flame structure, little effect of chemical activity on the spray flow upstream the lift-off length has been evidenced, in spite of the presence of formaldehyde in such regions. Only downstream of the lift-off length, as defined by OH LIF, has a strong change in flow pattern been observed as a result of combustion-induced heat release...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Solvent {{extraction}} is now finding {{applications in}} {{a broader range of}} fields than the past. Many of these applications require process equipment with shorter contact times, and in some cases {{to the point where the}} traditional equilibrium stage approach is not a good model for predicting performance. In addition, feed streams are becoming lower in concentration of the solute. This means greater feed to solvent flow ra-tios are being used and so loss of organics as entrainment in the feed is more of a concern both economi-cally and environmentally. These trends mean that a greater emphasis is being placed on the kinetics of ex-traction and stripping in models to predict performance and on formation and coalescence of <b>drops</b> to con-trol <b>entrainment.</b> This paper reviews recent advances in the tools for investigating kinetics and coalescence in solvent extraction processes and some of the insights that are being uncovered in these fundamental processes in solvent extraction technology.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} physical properties (interfacial tension, the viscosity of the dispersed and continuous phase, density difference, and solubility), and process conditions (flow rate, phase ratio, and temperature) on the <b>drop</b> size and <b>entrainment</b> in a static-mixer settler setup. Two extraction systems were investigated, that is, caprolactam–toluene–water and ethylbenzene (EB) -a-methyl benzyl alcohol (MBA) –water/NaOH (pH = 12). Depending on the system, the entrainment increased {{by a factor of}} 5 – 7, because of a change in the physical properties induced by changing the concentration of caprolactam and MBA. Different entrainment trends were observed for the two systems with phase ratio and temperature. The differences are explained by the drop break-up mechanisms reported in literature. The phase ratio effect resulted from on one hand turbulent attenuation and increased coalescence, {{and on the other hand}} increased shear and hindered settling at high phase ratios. The temperature influence was determined by its counteracting effects on the interfacial tension and the viscosities of continuous and dispersed phase...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} program {{was carried out}} at the University of Illinois in which develops a scientific approach to gas-liquid flows that explains their macroscopic behavior in terms of small scale interactions. For simplicity, fully-developed flows in horizontal and near-horizontal pipes. The difficulty in dealing with these flows is that the phases can assume a variety of configurations. The specific goal {{was to develop a}} scientific understanding of transitions from one flow regime to another and a quantitative understanding of how the phases distribute for a give regime. These basic understandings are used to predict macroscopic quantities of interest, such as frictional pressure <b>drop,</b> liquid hold-up, <b>entrainment</b> in annular flow and frequency of slugging in slug flows. A number of scientific issues are addressed. Examples are the rate of atomization of a liquid film, the rate of deposition of drops, the behavior of particles in a turbulent field, the generation and growth of interfacial waves. The use of drag-reducing polymers that change macroscopic behavior by changing small scale interactions was explored...|$|R
40|$|In this work, a regenerable sorbent for Hg {{retention}} {{based on}} carbon supported Au nanoparticles {{has been developed}} and tested. Honeycomb structures were chosen {{in order to avoid}} pressure <b>drop</b> and particle <b>entrainment</b> in a fixed bed. Carbon-based supports were selected in order to easily modify the surface chemistry to favour the Au dispersion. Results of Hg retention and regeneration were obtained in a bench scale experimental installation working at high space velocities (for sorbent, 53, 000 h− 1; for active phase, 2. 6 × 108 h− 1), 120 °C for retention temperature and Hg inlet concentration of 23 ppbv. Gold nanoparticles were shown to be the active phase for mercury capture through an amalgamating mechanism. The mercury captured by the spent sorbent can be easily released to be disposed or reused. Mercury evolution from spent sorbents was followed by TPD experiments showing that the sorbent can be regenerated at temperatures as low as 220 °C.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{application}} of electric field enhanced coalescence for entrainment reduction in a static-mixer settler setup for a caprolactam-toluene-water and an ethylbenzene (EB) -a -methyl benzyl alcohol (MBA) -water systems. The mixing of the organic and aqueous phase was done in a static-mixer and an AC/DC electric field was applied directly {{at the end of}} the static-mixer. The <b>drop</b> size and <b>entrainment</b> were measured at different flowrates, with and without the electric field, at a field strength of 0. 4 kV/cm and 1 kV/cm, and at frequencies ranging from 3 to 100 Hz. Significant drops coalescence was observed which resulted in 4 – 5 times less entrainment. The AC field was more efficient than the DC field and an optimum frequency of 3 – 10 Hz was obtained. Additionally, the role of phase ratio and temperature was examined. For the caprolactam system, the entrainment reduction efficiency increased up to a phase ratio of 10 % v/v and decreased again at 20 % v/v. For the MBA-EB-water system, the efficiency did not change much between a phase ratio of 5 % v/v and 10 % v/v but decreased at a phase ratio of 20 % v/v. Furthermore, entrainment decreased at high temperature for the MBA-EB-water system. However, it increased for the caprolactam-toluene-water system...|$|R
40|$|Cloud {{water samples}} {{were taken in}} September/October 2010 at Mt. Schmücke in a rural, forested area in Germany during the Lagrange-type Hill Cap Cloud Thuringia 2010 (HCCT- 2010) cloud experiment. Besides bulk {{collector}}s, a three-stage and a five-stage collector were applied and samples were analysed for inorganic ions (SO 42 −,NO 3 −, NH 4 +, Cl−, Na+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, K+), H 2 O 2 (aq), S(IV), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Campaign volume-weighted mean concentrations were 191, 142, and 39 µmol L− 1 for ammonium, nitrate, and sulfate respectively, between 4 and 27 µmol L− 1 for minor ions, 5. 4 µmol L− 1 for H 2 O 2 (aq), 1. 9 µmol L− 1 for S(IV), and 3. 9 mgC L− 1 for DOC. The concentrations compare well to more recent European cloud water data from similar sites. On a mass basis, organic material (as DOC × 1. 8) contributed 20 – 40 % (event means) to total solute concentrations and {{was found to have}} non-negligible impact on cloud water acidity. Relative standard deviations of major ions were 60 – 66 % for solute concentrations and 52 – 80 % for cloud water loadings (CWLs). The similar variability of solute concentrations and CWLs together with the results of back-trajectory analysis and principal component analysis, suggests that concentrations in incoming air masses (i. e. air mass history), rather than cloud liquid water content (LWC), were the main factor controlling bulk solute concentrations for the cloud studied. Droplet effective radius was found to be a somewhat better predictor for cloud water total ionic content (TIC) than LWC, even though no single explanatory variable can fully describe TIC (or solute concentration) variations in a simple functional relation due to the complex processes involved. Bulk concentrations typically agreed within a factor of 2 with co-located measurements of residual particle concentrations sampled by a counterflow virtual impactor (CVI) and analysed by an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS), with the deviations being mainly caused by systematic differences and limitations of the approaches (such as outgassing of dissolved gases during residual particle sampling). Scavenging efficiencies (SEs) of aerosol constituents were 0. 56 – 0. 94, 0. 79 – 0. 99, 0. 71 – 98, and 0. 67 – 0. 92 for SO 42 −, NO 3 −, NH 4 +, and DOC respectively when calculated as event means with in-cloud data only. SEs estimated using data from an upwind site were substantially different in many cases, revealing the impact of gas-phase uptake (for volatile constituents) and mass losses across Mt. Schmücke likely due to physical processes such as droplet scavenging by trees and/or <b>entrainment.</b> <b>Drop</b> size-resolved cloud water concentrations of major ions SO 42 −, NO 3 −, and NH 4 + revealed two main profiles: decreasing concentrations with increasing droplet size and “U” shapes. In contrast, profiles of typical coarse particle mode minor ions were often increasing with increasing drop size, highlighting the importance of a species' particle concentration size distribution for the development of size-resolved solute concentration patterns. Concentration differences between droplet size classes were typically < 2 for major ions from the three-stage collector and somewhat more pronounced from the five-stage collector, while they were much larger for minor ions. Due to a better separation of droplet populations, the five-stage collector was capable of resolving some features of solute size dependencies not seen in the three-stage data, especially sharp concentration increases (up to a factor of 5 – 10) in the smallest droplets for many solutes...|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} is concerned primarily with air-water flow in a horizontal 0. 032 m ID tube, {{and the influence}} of a 90 ° horizontal bend on the flow characteristics. Visualisation studies using high speed still photography and cine film, and <b>entrainment</b> and <b>drop</b> size measurements were conducted before and after the bend. Entrained mass fluxes were determined from film flow measurements carried out using the film removal technique, while the drop size distributions were measured with a laser diffraction technique. During these measurements the pressure in the test section was held between 1. 0 - 1. 4 bar, and at ambient temperature. Prior to the horizontal flow study, drop size and film flow rates were measured for vertical air-water flow in a 0. 01026 m ID tube. This extended the work of Jepson (1992) who reported the effect of gas density and surface tension on film flow rate, drop size and deposition mass transfer coefficient. Modifications to the equipment described by Jepson (1992) allowed an extension of the measurements to higher flow conditions. The visualisation study was taken across flow conditions that include stratified, annular and pseudo-slug flow regimes. Still photographs show the presence of air bubbles entrained in the liquid film, and the creation of liquid drops at the crest of roll waves. Drops were seen to be entrained from the liquid film by both bag break-up and ligament break-up mechanisms. At the bend, the phenomenon of film inversion was seen to occur. Also, a secondary flow existing in the gas phase at the bend can be responsible for a swirl movement observed in the liquid film, in which at {{the upper part of the}} tube the liquid was pulled from the outer wall of the bend to the top of the tube in an anti-clockwise, cork screwing fashion. In the lower half, the liquid film was drawn from the outer wall towards the bottom of the tube in a clockwise motion. From the cine films, information on drop velocity was also extracted. This showed the axial drop velocity to be constant over the time frame of analysis. No significant correlation was found between the drop size and the axial <b>drop</b> velocity. The <b>entrainment</b> results in the horizontal tube showed that for stratified/annular conditions the entrained liquid mass flux increases with liquid flow rate (for a fixed gas flow rate), and in some instances plateau conditions were reached. However, for the pseudo-slug regime the level of entrainment falls considerably. For the whole range of flow conditions studied, the entrained liquid mass flux increases with superficial gas velocity, except for GL = 10 kg/m 2 s where the amount of entrainment is constant. The reduction in entrained liquid mass flux after the bend above certain flow conditions, is caused by drops depositing on the outside wall of the bend. For the flow conditions under study, the Sauter mean diameter varies between 60 - 110 um. Gas velocity has a strong influence on drop size, ie, the higher the gas velocity the smaller the drop size. The effect of liquid flow rate is somewhat more complex. At the lower liquid flow rates, drop size seems to be controlled by the entrainment mechanisms, while at the higher liquid flows drop coalescence has a dominant effect. The influence of the 90 ° bend on the drop size distribution was to increase the diameter of the drops. Both the entrained liquid mass flux and drop size were found to be lower for horizontal annular flow than in vertical flow, for the same flow conditions and tube diameter. The measurements carried out for air-water flow in the vertical 0. 01026 m ID tube, showed the entrained mass flux to increase with both gas and liquid flow rates. For the flow conditions analysed, the Sauter mean diameter varies between 26 - 45 um. Drop size was seen to be influenced by gas and liquid flow rates, following similar trends to those observed during the horizontal study. ...|$|R
