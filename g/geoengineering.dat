The intent of <b>geoengineering</b> {{is to reduce the}} amount of global warming (the observed trend of increased global average temperature (NRC, 2008, p.2)). IPCC (2007b:15) concluded that reliable cost estimates for <b>geoengineering</b> options had not been published. This finding was based on medium agreement in the literature and limited evidence.|$|E

25|$|An {{abrupt stop}} to <b>geoengineering</b> with sulfate {{particle}} injections will make global warming even worse, according to researchers.|$|E
25|$|Injections {{of sulfur}} dioxide in the {{stratosphere}} has been proposed in climate engineering. The cooling effect {{would be similar to}} what has been observed after the large explosive volcano eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991. However this form of <b>geoengineering</b> would have uncertain regional consequences on rainfall patterns, for example in monsoon regions.|$|E
25|$|Aerosol {{particles}} are eventually deposited from the stratosphere onto land and ocean. Depending on {{the volume of}} particles descending, the effects may be significant to ecosystems, or may not be. Modelling of the quantities of aerosols used in likely <b>geoengineering</b> scenarios suggest that effects on terrestrial ecosystems from deposition {{is not likely to}} be significantly harmful.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} policy {{responses}} {{to global warming}} are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (climate change mitigation) and {{to adapt to the}} impacts of global warming (e.g., by building levees in response to sea level rise). Another policy response which has recently received greater attention is <b>geoengineering</b> of the climate system (e.g. injecting aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight away from the Earth's surface).|$|E
25|$|A {{carbon sink}} {{is a natural}} or {{artificial}} reservoir that accumulates and stores some carbon-containing chemical compound for an indefinite period, such as a growing forest. A negative carbon dioxide emission {{on the other hand}} is a permanent removal of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Examples are direct air capture, enhanced weathering technologies such as storing it in geologic formations underground and biochar. These processes are sometimes considered as variations of sinks or mitigation, and sometimes as <b>geoengineering.</b> In combination with other mitigation measures, sinks in combination with negative carbon emissions are considered crucial for meeting the 350 ppm target.|$|E
25|$|Climate engineering, {{commonly}} referred to as <b>geoengineering,</b> also known as climate intervention, There is substantial agreement among scientists that climate engineering cannot substitute for climate change mitigation. Some approaches might be used as accompanying measures to sharp cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. Given that all types of measures for addressing climate change have economic, political, or physical limitations, some climate engineering approaches might eventually be used as part of an ensemble of measures. Research on costs, benefits, and various types of risks of most climate engineering approaches is at an early stage and their understanding needs to improve to judge their adequacy and feasibility.|$|E
25|$|Enhanced {{weathering}} {{refers to}} chemical approach to remove carbon dioxide involving land or ocean based techniques. Examples of land based enhanced weathering techniques are in-situ carbonation of silicates. Ultramafic rock, for example, {{has the potential}} to store thousands of years worth of CO2 emissions according to one estimate. Ocean based techniques involve alkalinity enhancement, such as, grinding, dispersing and dissolving olivine, limestone, silicates, or calcium hydroxide to address ocean acidification and CO2 sequestration. Enhanced weathering is considered as one of the least expensive of <b>geoengineering</b> options. One example of a research project on the feasibility of enhanced weathering is the CarbFix project in Iceland.|$|E
500|$|Some {{scientists}} have suggested using aerosols {{to stave off}} the effects of global warming as an emergency <b>geoengineering</b> measure. In 1974, Mikhail Budyko suggested that if global warming became a problem, the planet could be cooled by burning sulfur in the stratosphere, which would create a haze. [...] An increase in planetary albedo of just 0.5 percent is sufficient to halve the effect of a CO2 doubling.|$|E
500|$|Anthropogenic {{climate change}} has likely exerted a major effect on {{amphibian}} declines. [...] For example, in the Monteverde Cloud Forest, {{a series of}} unusually warm years led to the mass disappearances of the Monteverde Harlequin frog and the Golden Toad. [...] An increased level of cloud cover, a result of <b>geoengineering</b> and global warming, which has warmed the nights and cooled daytime temperatures, has been blamed for facilitating the growth and proliferation of the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (the causative agent of the fungal infection chytridiomycosis).|$|E

2500|$|Creating stratospheric sulfur {{aerosols}} deliberately is {{a proposed}} <b>geoengineering</b> technique {{which offers a}} possible solution {{to some of the}} problems caused by global warming. [...] However, this will not be without side effects [...] and {{it has been suggested that}} the cure may be worse than the disease.|$|E
2500|$|The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) {{assessed}} {{the scientific literature}} on climate engineering (referred to as [...] "geoengineering" [...] in its reports), in which it considered carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation separately. Its Fifth Assessment Report states:Models consistently suggest that SRM would generally reduce climate differences compared to a world with elevated GHG concentrations and no SRM; however, there would also be residual regional differences in climate (e.g., temperature and rainfall) when compared to a climate without elevated GHGs....Models suggest that if SRM methods were realizable they would be effective in countering increasing temperatures, and would be less, but still, effective in countering some other climate changes. SRM would not counter all effects of climate change, and all proposed <b>geoengineering</b> methods also carry risks and side effects. Additional consequences cannot yet be anticipated {{as the level of}} scientific understanding about both SRM and CDR is low. There are also many (political, ethical, and practical) issues involving <b>geoengineering</b> that are {{beyond the scope of this}} report.|$|E
2500|$|The {{chemical}} reactions affecting both {{the formation and}} elimination of sulfur aerosols are not fully understood. [...] It is difficult to estimate accurately, for example, whether the presence of ash and water vapour is important for aerosol formation from volcanic products, and whether high or low atmospheric concentrations of precursor chemicals (such as SO2 and H2S) are optimal for aerosol formation. [...] This uncertainty {{makes it difficult to}} determine a viable approach for <b>geoengineering</b> uses of sulfur aerosol formation.|$|E
2500|$|Aerosols scatter light, {{which affects}} the {{appearance}} of the sky and of sunsets. Changing the concentration of aerosols in the atmosphere can dramatically affect {{the appearance of}} sunsets. A change in sky appearance during 1816, [...] "The Year Without A Summer" [...] (attributed to the eruption of Mount Tambora), was the inspiration for the paintings of J. M. W. Turner. Further volcanic eruptions and <b>geoengineering</b> projects involving sulfur aerosols are likely to affect the appearance of sunsets significantly, and to create a haze in the sky.|$|E
2500|$|... "There are {{alternatives}} to its [...] {{insistence that the}} only appropriate policy response is steep and immediate emissions reductions.... a greenhouse-gas-emissions cap ultimately would constrain energy production. A sensible climate policy would emphasize building resilience into our capacity to adapt to climate changes.... we should consider strategies of adaptation to a changing climate. A rise in the sea level need not {{be the end of}} the world, as the Dutch have taught us." [...] says Steven F. Hayward of American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank. Hayward also advocates the use of [...] "orbiting mirrors to rebalance the amounts of solar radiation different parts of the earth receive"—the space sunshade example of so-called <b>geoengineering</b> for solar radiation management.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2012, {{entrepreneur}} Russ George dispersed [...] of {{iron sulphate}} dust into the Pacific Ocean several hundred {{miles west of}} the islands of Haida Gwaii. The Old Massett Village Council was persuaded to finance this <b>geoengineering</b> project as a salmon enhancement project with $1 million in village funds. The concept was that the formerly iron-deficient waters would produce more phytoplankton that would in turn produce more salmon. George hoped to finance the project by using the carbon sequestration effects of the new plankton as marketable carbon offsets. The project has been plagued by charges of unscientific procedures and recklessness. George contended that 100 tons of iron is negligible compared to what naturally enters the ocean.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1985 report The Effects on the Atmosphere of a Major Nuclear Exchange, the Committee on the Atmospheric Effects of Nuclear Explosions {{argues that}} a [...] "plausible" [...] {{estimate}} {{on the amount of}} stratospheric dust injected following a surface burst of 1 Mt is 0.3 teragrams, of which 8 percent would be in the micrometer range. The potential cooling from soil dust was again looked at in 1992, in a US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report on <b>geoengineering,</b> which estimated that about 1010kg (100 teragrams) of stratospheric injected soil dust with particulate grain dimensions of 0.1 to 1 micrometer would be required to mitigate the warming from a doubling of atmospheric , that is, to produce ~2 ˚C of cooling.|$|E
2500|$|Estimates {{of direct}} costs for climate {{engineering}} implementation vary widely. In general, carbon dioxide removal methods {{are more expensive}} than the solar radiation management ones. In their 2009 report <b>Geoengineering</b> the Climate the Royal Society judged afforestation and stratospheric aerosol injection as the methods with the [...] "highest affordability" [...] (lowest costs). More recently, research into costs of solar radiation management have been published. [...] This suggests that [...] "well designed systems" [...] might be available for costs in the order of a few hundred million to {{tens of billions of dollars}} per year. [...] These are much lower than costs to achieve comprehensive reductions in CO2 emissions. Such costs would be within the budget of most nations, and even some wealthy individuals.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2009 review study, Lenton and Vaughan {{evaluated}} a {{range of}} proposed climate engineering techniques from those that sequester [...] from the atmosphere and decrease longwave radiation trapping, to those that decrease the Earth's receipt of shortwave radiation. In order to permit a comparison of disparate techniques, they used a common evaluation for each technique based on its effect on net radiative forcing. As such, the review examined the scientific plausibility of proposed methods rather than the practical considerations such as engineering feasibility or economic cost. Lenton and Vaughan found that [...] " [...] capture and storage shows the greatest potential, combined with afforestation, reforestation and bio-char production", and noted that [...] "other suggestions that have received considerable media attention, in particular [...] "ocean pipes" [...] appear to be ineffective". They concluded that [...] " [...] <b>geoengineering</b> is best considered as a potential complement to the mitigation of [...] emissions, {{rather than as an}} alternative to it".|$|E
50|$|<b>Geoengineering</b> {{is seen by}} Olivier Sterck as an {{alternative}} to mitigation and adaptation, but by Gernot Wagner as an entirely separate response to climate change. In a literature assessment, Barker et al. (2007) described <b>geoengineering</b> as a type of mitigation policy. IPCC (2007) concluded that <b>geoengineering</b> options, such as ocean fertilization to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, remained largely unproven. It was judged that reliable cost estimates for <b>geoengineering</b> had not yet been published.|$|E

Nevertheless, Cascio advocates that <b>geoengineering</b> be considered seriously as a way of keeping increases in global temperature to a minimum.|$|E
