5000|$|... s, {{also known}} as {{rethreading}} dies, are dies made for cleaning up damaged threads, have no split for resizing and are made from a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>bar</b> so that a wrench or shifter spanner {{can be used to}} turn them. Die nuts cannot be used to cut new threads.|$|E
50|$|The species largely {{feeds on}} {{crustaceans}} and bivalve molluscs that it excavates from the seabed. Other items in its diet include polychaete worms, gastropod molluscs, sea pens and small fish. Instead of having pointed teeth, it has flattened <b>hexagonal</b> <b>bars</b> and plates {{arranged in a}} mosaic pattern on its jaws; with these, it crushes the shells of its prey.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Needle-like apatites {{were formed}} on the pure {{titanium}} plate using a hydrothermal-electrochemical method. The solution of dichloromethane and poly-lactic acid / poly-glycolic acid copolymer (PLGA) was infiltrated to the deposited apatite and dried in air. After hardening of the film, the composite membrane was prepared by delamination from the titanium plate. The deposited needle-like apatites were <b>hexagonal</b> <b>bars</b> 0. 5 ~ 1 ?m in width and about 7 ?m in length. The apatite needles were well {{incorporated in the}} semitransparent copolymer film. The tips of the needles were exposed only on the side that contacted to the substrate...|$|R
40|$|Under severe {{earthquake}} conditions, {{the lack}} of strength and ductility in reinforced concrete beam–column joints with non-seismic details raises serious concerns for overall structural safety. In this study, experimental research {{was carried out in}} order to try and improve the seismic strength and performance of reinforced concrete exterior beam–column joints by applying embedded carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) bars combined with CFRP sheets. CFRP bars have a flat-typed hexagonal cross-section. Specimens of reinforced concrete exterior beam–column joints were manufactured based on a newly developed strengthening method by applying embedded CFRP <b>hexagonal</b> <b>bars</b> combined with externally bonded CFRP sheets, and tested for comparison with the specimen of a conventional reinforced concrete exterior beam–column joint. The newly developed design approach could minimize damage and improve the overall structural performances of beam–column joints under cyclic load reversals...|$|R
50|$|One {{common type}} of wrench is shown on the right. The loop of chain is placed around the filter, and the bar is turned {{anticlockwise}} by hand until the chain wraps itself tightly around the filter. A socket wrench or adjustable spanner is then used to turn the <b>hexagonal</b> <b>bar</b> further in the same direction. This increases {{the tension in the}} chain, which bites into the soft metal casing of the oil filter which helps prevent slippage.|$|E
5000|$|The trapbar deadlift is a {{variation}} of the deadlift using a special <b>hexagonal</b> <b>bar</b> (a trapbar). This allows more clearance for the knees to pass [...] "through" [...] the bar. To perform the trapbar deadlift, one loads the bar, steps inside the hollow portion of the bar, bends down, grasps the handles, stands erect, then lowers the bar to the ground in the exact opposite path. This is very helpful for both the handgrip and the lifter's hips.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] cat's paw or cat's claw is a {{standard}} carpenter's tool, consisting of a round or <b>hexagonal</b> <b>bar</b> that curves at one end to form a pointed, cup-shaped tip with a V-shaped cleft for gripping nailheads. Popular retail outlets currently call these a claw bar {{if it has a}} claw on each end, or a moulding bar if it has a claw on one end and a flat pry bar on the other. It essentially works as a small crowbar. To use the tool the user holds the tool's shank with one hand and drives the claw around a nailhead with a hammer. When the V is firmly seated around the nail's shank, the users pull the bar back to raise the head, then finishes pulling the nail with the hammer's claw. The cat's paw is well designed for demolition work, but because it tears up the wood around the nailhead, it should not be used for finish work.|$|E
40|$|When {{chemicals}} are applied using irrigation systems, there is potential for {{contamination of the}} water source by backflow if the irrigation system shuts off while unattended. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the operating and performance characteristics of new, i. e., unused, chemigation backflow prevention assemblies (CBPAs). Four manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s models were tested in the laboratory. However, two of CBPAs have been modified since the testing was completed. In general, the CBPAs do not meet the standards established for municipal water suppliers and many industries. The backpressures required for the two current models to seal were 0. 0 and 6. 7 kPa (1. 0 psi). Backflow was a function of backpressure for the three check valves that did not seal at zero backpressure. All four valves exhibited a backpressure backflow relationship when artificially fouled with <b>hexagonal</b> <b>bars</b> placed across the valves seat. At the backpressure head of 3. 7 m (12 ft), the low pressure drains on all models intercepted 100...|$|R

5000|$|This {{design project}} was {{designated}} T-34M. It had enhanced armour protection, a three-man <b>hexagonal</b> turret, torsion <b>bar</b> suspension instead of Christie suspension, road wheels with internal shock absorption, increased fuel capacity, and more main gun ammunition (100 rounds instead of 77 in standard T-34). The bow machine gun and driver's hatch switched {{positions on the}} glacis plate. In addition to six smaller wheels, the suspension of the T-34M had four return rollers. The original model V-2 12-cylinder diesel engine developing 500 hp (373 kW) {{was replaced by a}} new 12-cylinder diesel engine which produced [...] It had a new 8-speed transmission system. It was the first tank design to feature transverse engine placement, which made it smaller than a standard T-34 and gave the crew more space.|$|R
5000|$|Most metal {{produced}} by a steel mill or aluminium plant is formed (via rolling or extrusion) into long continuous strips of various size and shape. These strips are cut at regular intervals and allowed to cool, each segment becoming a piece of bar stock. A good analogy is pasta-making, in which lumps of dough are extruded into various cross-sectional shapes; cut into lengths; and then dried in that form. The cross-sectional shapes of pasta vary from simple bar or tube shapes (such as linguine or penne) to more elaborate extrusions (such as rotelle, fiori, or rotini). The {{same is true of}} metal bar stock. The most common shapes are round bar (also called rod), rectangular bar (including square bar, the special case of equal sides), and <b>hexagonal</b> <b>bar</b> (usually called hex bar for short). Tube and pipe are similar, but have hollow centers and are traditionally not called [...] "bar" [...] in industrial usage. (However, a product called hollow bar, essentially tube but with custom-orderable OD and ID and thus custom wall thickness, is marketed for lathe bar work which can benefit from obviation of drilling and rough boring.) Also similar in concept, but not called [...] "bar", are the common structural shapes such as angle stock and channel stock. These are commonly available in steel and aluminum; the names [...] "angle iron" [...] and [...] "channel iron" [...] are still commonly used (informally) even though their literal namesake, wrought iron, has been replaced by steel and aluminum for most uses.|$|E
40|$|Given {{that there}} is a wide range of {{chemical}} compositions of Hanford Tank Waste, we have studied mineral formation and transformation by systematically varying anion composition and OH concentrations of simulated tank solutions in presence and absence of Cs. The feldspathoids and zeolite formed in the presence of Cs were analyzed with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and solid state NMR. The presence of Cs in the simulant solutions did not affect the types of minerals formed in 1 M NaOH solutions until the Cs concentration was greater than 0. 1 M, a concentration that is not likely to occur in the sediment underlying the Hanford tanks. Elemental mapping indicated that incorporated Cs was homogeneously distributed in cancrinite and sodalite. High concentrations of Cs promoted the formation of highly crystalline cancrinite in <b>hexagonal</b> <b>bar</b> shape. The presence of Cs in solutions precluded the influence anions have shown in the non-cesium system. The presence of chloride anion was favorable for the formation of pure sodalite in a non-cesium solution, yet no sodalite has been found in the precipitates formed at high Cs concentration (0. 5 M). Adsorption experiments indicated that Cs could access the internal parts of LTA, cancrinite and sodalite, but the diffusion appeared more difficult than that of Na and K. Cesium exchange in cancrinite and sodalite caused structural disordering of the minerals as reflected by the XRD patterns...|$|E
40|$|X-ray {{transmission}} {{windows for}} the low energy range, especially between 0. 1 keV and 1 keV have been designed and fabricated based on graphenic carbon (GC) with an integrated silicon frame. A <b>hexagonal</b> and a <b>bar</b> grid support structure design have been evaluated. The bar grid design allows to substitute polymer-based windows with the advantages of higher transmission, better rejection of visible light and vacuum operability of the encapsulated silicon drift detectors (SDD). In addition, the high mechanical resilience of graphenic carbon is demonstrated by pressure cycle tests, yielding over 10 million cycles without damage. The data are complemented by bulge tests to determine a Young`s modulus for graphenic carbon of approximately 130 GPa. Additional finite-element simulation and Raman studies reveal that the mechanical stress is not homogeneously distributed, but reaches a maximum near the anchoring points of the free standing graphenic carbon membrane.
