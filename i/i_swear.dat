500|$|Charles B. Harris sees Jake's and Joe's intellectualism as a Freudian obsessional neurosis. [...] To Freud, he writes, {{the source}} of such a {{condition}} lies in [...] "the chronic existence of love and hatred, both directed towards the same person and both of the highest degree of intensity".

500|$|The {{success of}} the {{television}} series The Darling Buds of May (199193) made Zeta-Jones a popular celebrity in Britain, and her personal life has since been chronicled by the media. Her relationships in the early 1990s with the television personality John Leslie, the singer David Essex, and the pop star Mick Hucknall were widely reported by the British press.

500|$|News {{footage of}} then-President Bill Clinton was {{digitally}} altered {{to make it}} appear as if he is speaking about alien contact. This was not the original plan for the film; Zemeckis had initially approached Sidney Poitier to play the president, but the actor turned the role down in favor of The Jackal. Shortly after Poitier's refusal, Zemeckis saw a NASA announcement in August 1996. [...] "Clinton gave his Mars rock speech," [...] the director explained, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>swear</b> to God it was like it was scripted for this movie.

500|$|Jeff {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "cartoon-like, diseased lung cowboy created by crossing the diseased lung pictured on cigarette packs in Australia with the Marlboro Man". Similarly, Rolling Stone Daniel Kreps said Jeff helps to [...] "bridge the gap between the Marlboro Man ... and a 'lung that looks like you're breathing through baked ziti'". Alicia Lu of Bustle wrote: Sure, he may be an anthropomorphic lung that's decaying from being exposed to years of cigarette smoke, which might not be Big Tobacco's first choice for branding, but he's a cowboy. Look at his regal cowboy hat, his spiffy red cowboy boots, and the way that cigarette nonchalantly dangles from his lips – doesn't Jeff remind you of a figure from days of yore? If you squint, <b>I</b> <b>swear</b> you'll see the Marlboro Man.|$|E

500|$|... "Bigger", {{described}} as moderately fast, is a R song with {{a length of}} three minutes and seventeen seconds, with inclinations toward teen pop and dance-pop. According to a review of My World by Jon Caramanica of The New York Times, the song is influenced by new jack swing, {{as well as the}} music of [...] Guy.

It is written in the key of C minor, and Bieber's vocals do not deviate far, only spanning from the low note of C4 to the high note of E5. It features the chord patterns Cm11 and Fm9. The song's lyrics see the protagonist professing to their love interest how they have matured, in lines such as [...] "I was a player when I was little, but I'm bigger." [...] Lyrically, the song also speaks of rebuffing anyone that comes in between his reaching goals, in lines like [...] "And all the haters <b>I</b> <b>swear</b> they look so small from up here..." ...|$|E
