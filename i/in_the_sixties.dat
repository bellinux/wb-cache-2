5|$|I was {{as student}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixties,</b> {{engaged in the}} civil rights movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin.

I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E
