5|$|After Speers' {{retirement}} in 1957, John Middaugh was minister from 1958 to 1968. Middaugh {{was a regular}} panelist for ten years on the weekly television program To Promote Goodwill, an interfaith discussion of social and religious issues produced by WBAL-TV and broadcast worldwide on the Voice of America. He was also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forefront</b> {{of the civil rights}} movement in the early 1960s. Along with William Sloan Coffin and dozens of other clergymen and civil rights activists, Middaugh was arrested in a clash with police at Baltimore's Gwynn Oak Amusement Park in July 1963 over efforts to desegregate the popular attraction.|$|E
5|$|Bold {{experiments}} in cinematic storytelling were sometimes attempted during the classic era: Lady in the Lake, for example, is shot entirely {{from the point}} of view of protagonist Philip Marlowe; the face of star (and director) Robert Montgomery is seen only in mirrors. The Chase (1946) takes oneirism and fatalism as the basis for its fantastical narrative system, redolent of certain horror stories, but with little precedent in the context of a putatively realistic genre. In their different ways, both Sunset Boulevard and D.O.A. are tales told by dead men. Latter-day noir has been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forefront</b> of structural experimentation in popular cinema, as exemplified by such films as Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, and Memento.|$|E

5|$|Hollywood, a {{northern}} district of Los Angeles, California, {{is one of}} the leaders in motion picture production. The world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison's Kinetoscope. The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forefront</b> of sound film's development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.|$|E
5|$|The KRRC Rhodesians were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forefront</b> of the Allied column {{pursuing}} the retreating Axis forces after El Alamein, advancing through Tobruk, Gazala and Benghazi before reaching El Agheila on 24 November 1942. They patrolled around the Axis right flank until being withdrawn to Timimi in December. Tripoli {{fell to the}} Eighth Army on 23 January 1943, and six days later Allied forces reached Tunisia's south-eastern frontier, where Italian and German forces manned the Mareth Line, a series of fortifications built by the French in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The late 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries saw the {{construction}} of a floating harbour, advances in shipbuilding and further industrialisation with the growth of the glass, paper, soap and chemical industries aided by the establishment of Bristol as the terminus of the Great Western Railway by I. K. Brunel. In the early 20th century, Bristol was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forefront</b> of aircraft manufacture and the city had become an important financial centre and high technology hub {{by the beginning of the}} 21st century.|$|E

5|$|For {{extraordinary}} heroism {{while serving}} as a Leader of a Machine-Gun Section, Company C, 1st Battalion, 27th Marines, 5th Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 1945. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation shortly after landing when his company's advance was held up by the concentrated fire of a heavily fortified Japanese blockhouse, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE boldly defied the smashing bombardment of heavy caliber fire to work {{his way around the}} flank and up to a position directly on top of the blockhouse and then, attacking with grenades and demolitions, single handedly destroyed the entire hostile strong point and its defending garrison. Consistently daring and aggressive as he fought his way over the battle-torn beach and up the sloping, gun-studded terraces toward Airfield Number 1, he repeatedly exposed himself to the blasting fury of exploding shells and later in the day coolly proceeded to the aid of a friendly tank which had been trapped in an enemy mine field under intense mortar and artillery barrages, skillfully guiding the heavy vehicle over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite the overwhelming volume of hostile fire. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>forefront</b> of the assault at all times, he pushed forward with dauntless courage and iron determination until, moving upon the edge of the airfield, he fell, instantly killed by a bursting mortar shell. Stouthearted and indomitable, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE, by his intrepid initiative, outstanding skill, and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice {{in the face of the}} fanatic opposition, contributed materially to the advance of his company during the early critical period of the assault, and his unwavering devotion to duty throughout the bitter conflict was an inspiration to his comrades and reflects the highest credit upon Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.|$|E

40|$|<b>In</b> {{advancing}} to <b>the</b> <b>forefront</b> <b>the</b> objective {{of improving the}} planning {{and management of the}} economy of developed socialist society, the Twenty-Fourth Congress of the CPSU emphasized the necessity of applying mathematical methods in this area. Through them it is possible to obtain the most precisely balanced variant of the plan assuring the successful management of the economy, i. e., the best, optimal variant. Accordingly, <b>the</b> central point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> use of economic-mathematical methods must be their application in optimal planning. ...|$|R

30|$|Since a {{seismogram}} at {{the nearby}} Cavalese station (3.7  km from the collapsed tailings dams) had recorded the event, Takahashi used the available data to interpret the large vibrations as collisions of the flowing mass against particular obstacles along its path (Takahashi 1991). On the basis of records of the event, {{it was estimated that}} the whole event, from the flowing into the Stava Creek (Fig.  4, section 1) to the flowing out to the Avisio River, lasted about 425  s, and that velocities of up to 37  m/s were reached. <b>In</b> particular, <b>the</b> <b>forefront</b> arrived at <b>the</b> Romano Bridge (Fig.  4, section 13) about 225  s after it had passed section 1 (Fig.  4).|$|R

We did not, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of Paddy, [...] "tack it {{on after}} more important things," [...] but put it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> very <b>forefront</b> of our petitions. Even skeptical Dan prayed, his skepticism falling {{away from him}} like a discarded garment in this valley of the shadow, which sifts out hearts and tries souls, until we all, grown-up or children, realize our weakness, and, finding that our own puny strength is as a reed shaken <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind, creep back humbly to the God we have vainly dreamed we could do without.|$|R
25|$|Anderson's {{promotion}} of 'free thought' in all subjects, including politics and morality, was controversial {{and brought him}} into constant conflict with the august senate of the university.
