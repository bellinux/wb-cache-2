25|$|Although any {{preservation}} of this knowledge in literary sources from the Middle Ages is unknown, medieval masons and some military engineers maintained an active tradition of using <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> in {{structures such as}} canals, fortresses, harbors, and shipbuilding facilities.|$|E
25|$|Deposits of {{limestone}} and coral were quarried to meet local construction needs. Production {{of limestone}} in 2000 amounted to 1.5 million tons. Clays and shale, sand and gravel, and carbonaceous deposits provided limited yields. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> production totalled 267,659 tons in 2000, up from 106,515 in 1996.|$|E
25|$|Cement {{starts to}} set when mixed with water which causes {{a series of}} {{hydration}} chemical reactions. The constituents slowly hydrate and the mineral hydrates solidify; the interlocking of the hydrates gives cement its strength. Contrary to popular perceptions, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cements</b> do not set by drying out; proper curing requires maintaining the appropriate moisture content during the curing process. If <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cements</b> dry out during curing, the resulting product can be significantly weakened.|$|R

25|$|Cement {{was made}} of {{hydrated}} lime (calcium oxide) mixed with sand and water. The Romans discovered that substituting or supplementing the sand with a pozzolanic additive, such as volcanic ash, would produce a very hard cement, known as hydraulic mortar or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement.</b> They used it widely in structures such as buildings, public baths and aqueducts, ensuring their survival into the modern era.|$|E
25|$|Lime (calcium oxide) {{was used}} on Crete {{and by the}} ancient Greeks. There is {{evidence}} that the Minoans of Crete used crushed potshards as an artificial pozzolan for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement.</b> It is uncertain where it was first discovered that a combination of hydrated non-hydraulic lime and a pozzolan produces a hydraulic mixture (see also: Pozzolanic reaction), but concrete made from such mixtures was used by the Ancient Macedonians and three centuries later on a large scale by Roman engineers.|$|E
25|$|Hydraulic cements (e.g., Portland cement) set {{and become}} {{adhesive}} {{due to a}} chemical reaction between the dry ingredients and water. The chemical reaction results in mineral hydrates that are not very water-soluble and so are quite durable in water and safe from chemical attack. This allows setting in wet condition or underwater and further protects the hardened material from chemical attack. The chemical process for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> found by ancient Romans used volcanic ash (pozzolana) with added lime (calcium oxide).|$|E
25|$|Expansive cements contain, in {{addition}} to Portland clinker, expansive clinkers (usually sulfoaluminate clinkers), and are designed to offset the effects of drying shrinkage that is normally encountered with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cements.</b> This allows large floor slabs (up to 60m square) to be prepared without contraction joints.|$|R
25|$|Calcium {{aluminate}} <b>cements</b> are <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cements</b> made {{primarily from}} limestone and bauxite. The active ingredients are monocalcium aluminate CaAl2O4 (CaO · Al2O3 or CA in Cement chemist notation, CCN) and mayenite Ca12Al14O33 (12 CaO · 7 Al2O3, or C12A7 in CCN). Strength forms by hydration to calcium aluminate hydrates. They are well-adapted {{for use in}} refractory (high-temperature resistant) concretes, e.g. for furnace linings.|$|R

Almost every wall is decorated with hand painted and stenciled art recreating geometric patterns and classic motifs: garlands, pilasters, columns and linear designs to accentuate the corners. All floors are of wooden planks made out of tabloncillo (sideroxylon portoricense), with {{the exception}} of the gallery's floor, which consist of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> tiles, result of an early twentieth century intervention. The ceiling also consists of wooden planks, mostly decorated with hand painted geometric motifs and stenciled designs.|$|E
25|$|In the past, fly ash was {{generally}} {{released into the}} atmosphere, but air pollution control standards now require that it be captured prior to release by fitting pollution control equipment. In the US, fly ash is generally stored at coal power plants or placed in landfills. About 43% is recycled, often used as a pozzolan to produce <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> or hydraulic plaster and a replacement or partial replacement for Portland cement in concrete production. Pozzolans ensure the setting of concrete and plaster and provide concrete with more protection from wet conditions and chemical attack.|$|E
25|$|The Greeks used {{volcanic}} tuff {{from the island}} of Thera as their pozzolan and the Romans used crushed volcanic ash (activated aluminium silicates) with lime. This mixture was able to set under water increasing its resistance. The material was called pozzolana {{from the town of}} Pozzuoli, west of Naples where volcanic ash was extracted. In the absence of pozzolanic ash, the Romans used powdered brick or pottery as a substitute and they may have used crushed tiles for this purpose before discovering natural sources near Rome. The huge dome of the Pantheon in Rome and the massive Baths of Caracalla are examples of ancient structures made from these concretes, many of which are still standing. The vast system of Roman aqueducts also made extensive use of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{quantity}} {{and characteristics of}} the components of amorphous silica – alkali reactions, based on the research carried at the CSIRO Laboratories in Australia and by the author are discussed. Conditions under which the expansion of silica-gel can be reduced to a safe level or even completely eliminated are presented. The emphasis is made on the commercially viable and the most economical means of the safe use of crushed soda-lime glasses (which account for about ninety percent of all manufactured glasses) as an aggregate in structural, durable and dimensionally stable concretes, in which <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cements</b> are used as a binder. With the depletion of good quality natural aggregates from quarries located in the proximity of construction and development sites, the use of recycled materials becomes particularly important in the current climate of global recession. It should be emphasized, however, that the results of these findings may not be universal, and when applied to the specific local conditions (both – glass and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cements)</b> should be verified in the laboratory tests...|$|R

When the surrounding town of Rosendale was created from parts of Hurley, New Paltz and Marbletown on April26, 1844, {{the village was}} referred to by the same name as the town. On December7, 1847, New York passed a law which allowed the municipal incorporation of villages within the state. The Wallkill Valley Railroad was opened to Rosendale in 1871, with the Rosendale trestle across the Rondout Creek completed the following year. James S. McEntee, a former Delaware and Hudson engineer, {{was the only person}} to have seen the opening of both the canal and the trestle. The Rosendale station was the largest depot on the Wallkill Valley rail line. Unlike the other stations on the line, it was designed to have an [...] "L" [...] shape, rather than being rectangular, because the building was [...] "squeezed by the severe slope behind it". In 1888, a pinkeye outbreak killed off many horses in Rosendale and along the canal.|$|E

25|$|Concrete is a {{composite}} material composed of coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement that hardens over time. Most concretes used are lime-based concretes such as Portland cement concrete or concretes made with other <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cements,</b> such as ciment fondu. However, asphalt concrete, which is frequently used for road surfaces, is also a type of concrete, where the cement material is bitumen, and polymer concretes are sometimes used where the cementing material is a polymer.|$|R
50|$|Concrete, and in particular, the {{hydraulic}} mortar {{responsible for its}} cohesion, was a type of structural ceramic whose utility derived largely from its rheological plasticity in the paste state. The setting and hardening of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cements</b> derived from hydration of materials and the subsequent chemical and physical interaction of these hydration products. This differed from the setting of slaked lime mortars, the most common cements of the pre-Roman world. Once set, Roman concrete exhibited little plasticity, although it retained some resistance to tensile stresses.|$|R
40|$|It is {{commonly}} {{believed that the}} ancient Romans {{were the first to}} create and use concrete. This is not true, as we can easily learn from the Latin literature itself. For sure, Romans were able to prepare high-quality <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cements,</b> comparable with the modern Portland cements. In this paper, we will see that the use of concrete is quite older, ranging back to the Homeric times.

2500|$|Herod spent lavish sums on {{his various}} {{building}} projects and generous gifts to other kingdoms, including Rome. His buildings were very large, ambitious projects. Herod {{was responsible for}} the construction of the Temple Mount, a portion of which remains today as the Western Wall. In addition, Herod also used the latest technology in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> and underwater construction to build the harbor at Caesarea. While Herod's zeal for building transformed Judea, his motives were not selfless. Although, he did build fortresses (Masada, Herodium, Alexandrium, Hyrcania, and Machaerus) that he and his family could go to in case of insurrection, all these vast projects were aimed at gaining the support of the Jews and improving his reputation as a leader. [...] While gaining the support for the Jews, Herod also built Sebaste and other pagan cities because he wanted to appeal to the country’s substantial pagan population as well as the Jews. However, in order to fund these expenses, Herod utilized a Hasmonean taxation system that weighed heavily on the Judean people. Despite the economic burden placed by Herod's building projects and gifts, these enterprises also brought employment and opportunities for the people's provision. In some instances, Herod took it upon himself to provide for his people during times of need, such as during a severe famine that occurred in 25 BCE.|$|E
40|$|The article {{provides}} {{information about the}} main directions {{of the use of}} nanotechnogenic slurry waste, i. e. the industrial waste of Samara enterprises in the production of special building materials, namely, heat-resistant binders and concretes on their basis. It is found that nanotechnogenic wastes exert a polyfunctional impact in heat- resistant compositions (binders, mortars, concretes). High – alumina slurries are a plasticizer in heat-resistant composites on <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cements.</b> They are also a major component in the production of high- alumina binders and in the process of synthesizing phosphate binders which make it possible to obtain high-quality heat-resistant composites (mortars, coatings, concretes, impregnations) ...|$|R

In tension, SFRHSC fails {{only after the}} steel fiber breaks or is {{pulled out of the}} cement matrix. A more general and current approach to the mechanics of fiber reinforcing assumes a crack arrest mechanism based on fracture mechanics. In this model, the energy to extend a crack and debond the fibers in the matrix relates to the properties of the composite. The designers may best view SFRHSC as a concrete with increased strain capacity, impact resistance, energy absorption, fatigue endurance and tensile strength...|$|R

60|$|We then bent eastward {{towards the}} Jibál el-Salbah, and {{examined}} the two dwarf valleys which, threading the heights, feed the Wady Dumayghah. That to the south showed us a perfectly familiar formation; conglomerates of water-rolled pebbles in the lower levels, and hills of the normal dark porphyries, with large quartz-seams of many colours trending in every direction. The mouth of the northern gorge was blocked by a vein of finely crystallized carbonate of lime, containing geodes and bunches. The taste is astringent, probably from the alumina; and it is based upon outcrops of a sandy calcaire apparently fit for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement.</b> The only novelty in the vegetation was the Fashak-tree, a creeper like a gigantic constrictor, with sweet yellow wood somewhat resembling liquorice.|$|E
60|$|It {{must have}} been a bright and {{brilliant}} bit of colouring in its best days--hence, possibly, the local tradition that the stone sweats oil. The whole building, from the pavement to the coping, notched to receive the roof-joists, is of alabaster, plain-white and streaked with ruddy, mauve, and dark bands, whose mottling gives the effect of marble. Perhaps in places the gypsum has been subjected to plutonic action; and we thought that the coloured was preferred to the clear for the bases of the columns. The exposed foundations of the eastern and western walls, where the torrent has washed away the northern enceinte, show that, after the fashion of ancient Egypt, sandstone slabs have been laid underground, the calcaire being reserved for the hypaethral part. The admirable <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> is here and there made {{to take the place of}} broken corners, and flaws have been remedied by carefully letting in small cubes of sound stone.

40|$|In {{order to}} produce a quality grout from LLW using <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cements,</b> proper {{conditioning}} of the waste is essential for complete cement curing. Several technologies were investigated as options for conditions. Since the LLW is dilute, removal of all, or most, of the water will significantly reduce the final waste volume. Neutralization of the LLW is also desirable since acidic liquids to not allow cement to cure properly. The nitrate compounds are very soluble and easily leached from solid waste forms; therefore, denitration is desirable.

Two dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD-brushite) <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cements,</b> an apatite <b>hydraulic</b> fiber loaded <b>cement,</b> and a calcium sulfate cement (Plaster of Paris) were implanted in epiphyseal and metaphyseal cylindrical bone defects in sheep. The in vivo study was performed to assess the biocompatibility and bone remodeling of four cement formulations. After time periods of 2, 4, and 6 months, the cement samples were clinically and histologically evaluated. Histomorphometrically, the amount of new bone formation, fibrous tissue, and bone marrow and the area of remaining cement were measured. In all specimens, no signs of inflammation were detectable either macroscopically or microscopically. Cements differed mainly in their resorption time. Calcium sulfate was already completely resorbed at 2 months and showed a variable amount of new bone formation and/or fibrous tissue in the original drill hole over all time periods. The two DCPD cements in contrast were degraded to a large amount at 6 months, whereas the apatite was almost unchanged over all time period...|$|R
50|$|Rosendale cement {{generally}} {{refers to}} a type of natural cement that was produced in and around Rosendale, New York, from argillaceous limestone, but is a term that has had different definitions at different times.

Because of its reputation, Rosendale cement has also been used as both a trade name and as a generic term referring to natural <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cements</b> produced elsewhere.
