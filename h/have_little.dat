5|$|The 2008 {{financial}} crisis and subsequent recession highlighted limitations of existing macroeconomic theories, models, and econometrics.

5|$|Alprazolam is metabolized in the liver, {{mostly by}} the enzyme {{cytochrome}} P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Two major metabolites are produced: 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam, {{as well as}} an inactive benzophenone. The low concentrations and low potencies of 4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam indicate that they <b>have</b> <b>little</b> to no contribution to the effects of alprazolam.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoan larvae {{either have}} large yolks or {{are capable of}} feeding on plankton, and some already have endosymbiotic algae that help to feed them. Since the parents are immobile, these feeding {{capabilities}} extend the larvae's range and avoid overcrowding of sites. Scyphozoan and hydrozoan larvae <b>have</b> <b>little</b> yolk and most lack endosymbiotic algae, and therefore have to settle quickly and metamorphose into polyps. Instead, these species rely on their medusae to extend their ranges.|$|E

As a result, the merchants often turned to force, seizing the ivory, even this proved {{not to be}} economical and the merchant ventures <b>had</b> <b>little</b> success. Christian missionaries also established posts in the region, with the Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Central Africa, covering the region. The missionaries also <b>had</b> <b>little</b> impact on {{the region in the}} early 19th century.|$|R

Faggoting is stretchy and open, and most faggoting stitches {{look the same}} on both sides, making them ideal for garments like lacy scarves or stockings.|$|R
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{sometimes}} prescribed to treat behavioral symptoms of dementia. However, like antidepressants, they <b>have</b> <b>little</b> evidence of effectiveness, although antipsychotics have shown some benefit. Cognitive impairing effects of benzodiazepines that occur {{frequently in the}} elderly can also worsen dementia.|$|E
5|$|Carson and {{the others}} {{involved}} with publication of Silent Spring expected fierce criticism. They were particularly concerned {{about the possibility of}} being sued for libel. Carson was also undergoing radiation therapy to combat her spreading cancer, and expected to <b>have</b> <b>little</b> energy to devote to defending her work and responding to critics. In preparation for the anticipated attacks, Carson and her agent attempted to amass as many prominent supporters as possible before the book's release.|$|E

Some types of seizures may change brain structure, while others appear to <b>have</b> <b>little</b> effect. Gliosis, neuronal loss, and atrophy of specific {{areas of the brain}} are linked to epilepsy but it is unclear if epilepsy causes these changes or if these changes result in epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Germanium is {{not thought}} to be an {{essential}} element for any living organism. Some complex organic germanium compounds are being investigated as possible pharmaceuticals, though none have yet proven successful. Similar to silicon and aluminum, natural germanium compounds tend to be insoluble in water and thus <b>have</b> <b>little</b> oral toxicity. However, synthetic soluble germanium salts are nephrotoxic, and synthetic chemically reactive germanium compounds with halogens and hydrogen are irritants and toxins.|$|E
