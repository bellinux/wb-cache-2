25|$|Oladotun has {{an innate}} {{affinity}} for dance {{and he did}} that a whole lot as a kid, his love for legendary Michael Jackson's and Soul Brothers' James Brown's moves fueled the passion and had him take it much more seriously, and while in the university, he instituted a dance group he called Xtreme, they rocked different events {{on and off the}} university campus, shuttering between pursuit of passion and academic excellence. He became popular on campus as a result. Shortly after school he <b>joined</b> (<b>now</b> P-Square's official choreographer), Nonso Asobe's (a.k.a. Don Flexxx) dance group Ignite and performed in many events. Then in 2006 he featured on popular African act, D'banj's smashing hit, Why Me video as a dancer and on DJ Zeez's, Same Ni video. His dancing career was steady-rising towards peak when busy radio schedules among other activities choked out the time he made out for professional dancing.|$|E

They grasped them suddenly by the throat and held a knife before their eyes, Boldero telling them in a stern whisper that if they uttered a cry they would be stabbed to the heart. Paralysed by the sudden attack they {{did not make the}} slightest struggle, but accompanied their unknown assailants to the forecastle and were there fastened in. <b>Joined</b> <b>now</b> by the Spaniard, Geoffrey and his companion went aft and roused one of the sleepers there with a threat similar to that which had silenced the sailors.|$|E
60|$|When tea was over, Mr. Hurst {{reminded}} {{his sister-in-law}} of the card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy {{did not wish}} for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and {{the silence of the}} whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, <b>joined</b> <b>now</b> and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet.|$|E
60|$|These {{extraordinary}} towns {{were ten}} miles apart, {{a few months}} ago, but were growing so fast that they may possibly be <b>joined</b> <b>now,</b> and getting along under a single mayor. At any rate, within {{five years from now}} there will be at least such a substantial ligament of buildings stretching between them and uniting them that a stranger {{will not be able to}} tell where the one Siamese twin leaves off and the other begins. Combined, they will then number a population of two hundred and fifty thousand, if they continue to grow as they are now growing. Thus, this center of population at the head of Mississippi navigation, will then begin a rivalry as to numbers, with that center of population at the foot of it--New Orleans.|$|E

60|$|<b>Joined</b> <b>now</b> by Cluny, Charles {{moved on}} that old base of Montrose, the Castle of Blair of Atholl, where the exiled duke (commonly called Marquis of Tullibardine) was {{received}} with enthusiasm. In the mid-region between Highland and Lowland, the ladies, Lady Lude and the rest, simply forced their sons, brothers, and lovers into arms. While Charles danced and made friends, and tasted his first pine-apple at Blair, James Mor took the fort of Inversnaid. At Perth (September 4-10) Charles {{was joined by}} the Duke of Perth, the Ogilvys under Lord Ogilvy, some Drummonds under Lord Strathallan, the Oliphants of Gask, and 200 Robertsons of Struan. Lord George Murray, brother of the Duke of Atholl, who had been out in 1715, out in 1719, and later was un reconcilie, came in, and with him came Discord. He had dealt as a friend and ally with Cope at Crieff; his loyalty to either side was thus not unnaturally dubious; he was suspected by Murray of Broughton; envied by Sullivan, a soldier of some experience; and though he was loyal to the last,--the best organiser, and the most daring leader,--Charles never trusted him, and his temper was always crossing that of the Prince.|$|E
60|$|Now, it {{is worth}} {{remarking}} that we--I mean even religious people-- speak {{very little about the}} kingdom of God nowadays. One hears less about it than about any other words, almost, which stand in the New Testament. Both in sermons and in religious books, and in the talk of godly people, one hears the kingdom of God spoken of very seldom. One hears words about the Church, which are very good and true; but very little, if anything, about the kingdom of God, though both St. Paul, and St. John, and the blessed Lord Himself, speak of the two together, as if they could not be parted; as if one could not think of the one without thinking of the other. And we hear words about the gospel, too, some of them very good and true, and others, I am sorry to say, very bad and false: but, true or false, they are not often <b>joined</b> <b>now</b> in men's minds, or mouths, or books, with the kingdom of God. But the New Testament joins them almost always. It says that gospel must be good news. Therefore the gospel must be good news about something. But about what? We hear all manner of answers nowadays; but we hear the right one very seldom. People talk of the gospel as if it only meant the good news that one man can be saved here, and another man can be saved there. And that is good news, certainly. It is good and blessed news to hear that any one poor sinner can be saved from sin, and from the wages of sin. But the holy scriptures, when they talk of the gospel, call it the gospel of the kingdom of God. And I think it best and wisest to call it oftenest, what the holy scripture calls it oftenest, and to try and understand, first of all, what that means, what the good news of the kingdom of God is: and to understand that, we must first understand what the kingdom of God is.|$|E
6000|$|Wherefore he also {{falls on}} upon the Prince's army {{with all his}} deadly force: so the battle was <b>joined.</b> <b>Now</b> who was it that at first Diabolus met with in the fight, but Captain Credence on the one hand, and the Lord Willbewill on the other: now Willbewill's blows were like the blows of a giant, for that man had a strong arm, and he fell in upon the {{election}} doubters, for they were the life-guard of Diabolus, and he kept them in play a good while, cutting and battering shrewdly. Now when Captain Credence saw my lord engaged, he did stoutly fall on, on the other hand, upon the same company also; so they put them to great disorder. Now Captain Good-Hope had engaged the vocation doubters, and they were sturdy men; but the captain was a valiant man: Captain Experience did also send him some aid; so he made the vocation doubters to retreat. The rest of the armies were hotly engaged, and that on every side, and the Diabolonians did fight stoutly. Then did my Lord Secretary command that the slings from the castle should be played; and his men could throw stones at an hair's breadth. But, after a while, those that were made to fly before the captains of the Prince, did begin to rally again, and they came up stoutly upon {{the rear of the}} Prince's army: wherefore the Prince's army began to faint; but, remembering that they should see the face of their Prince by-and-by, they took courage, and a very fierce battle was fought. Then shouted the captains, saying, 'The sword of the Prince Emmanuel, and the shield of Captain Credence!' and with that Diabolus gave back, thinking that more aid had been come. But no Emmanuel as yet appeared. Moreover, the battle did hang in doubt; and they made a little retreat on both sides. Now, in the time of respite, Captain Credence bravely encouraged his men to stand to it; and Diabolus did the like, as well as he could. But Captain Credence made a brave speech to his soldiers, the contents whereof here follow:- ...|$|E
