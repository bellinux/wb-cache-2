40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with measuring impacts of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on farm income distribution of western Germany. Not only the sheer contribution of market price support and direct payments {{as a proportion of}} income is taken into account, but also the impact of support on production incentives. For this purpose, we apply a modelling system consisting of a partial equilibrium model and a programming model. Based on a comparison of Gini coefficients and a decomposition of overall inequality effects we conclude that liberalization of the agricultural sector leads to a more unequal distribution of family farm income in relative terms, whereas a liberalized market provides a more equal situation in absolute terms. Furthermore, we consider the impacts of liberalizing the agricultural market on regional differences in average agricultural income and conclude that in relative terms liberalization increases regional inequality.

40|$|From the Introduction]. The main {{question}} addressed by {{this paper is}} how to reach a more equitable <b>distribution</b> of <b>CAP’s</b> payments pragmatically, politically and economically? Pragmatically, the CAP is a multi-functional policy, which has to combine different goals, i. e. to be more equitable, green and market-oriented. However, these objectives are not always compatible and require trade-offs. Politically, regarding the CAP’s significant share (40 %) of the EU budget and the current public debt crisis, Member States {{are most likely to}} keep their attention on the juste retour calculations rather than the promotion of the European public interest in the EU negotiations. Economically, reaching a more equitable distribution of payments should be achieved without significant disruptive changes that could have serious consequences on {{the costs and benefits of}} the agricultural sector in the EU. Considering these elements, it is already clear that reaching a more equitable <b>distribution</b> of <b>CAP’s</b> payments represents a difficult challenge...|$|R
40|$|The {{departure}} in modelling terms {{from the}} log-normal distribution for option pricing {{has been largely}} driven by empirical observations on skewness. In recent years, the Weibull and generalized beta distributions {{have been used to}} fit the risk-neutral density from option prices. In this article, we also propose the use of the generalized gamma distribution for recovering the risk-neutral density. In terms of complexity, this distribution, having three parameters, falls between the Weibull and generalized beta distributions. New option pricing formulas for European call and put options are derived under the generalized gamma distribution. The empirical evidence based on a set of interest rate derivatives data indicates that this distribution is capable of producing the same type of performance as the Weibull, generalized beta, and Burr 3 distributions. In addition, we analyze the effect of July 2005 bombings in London on interest rate markets under the best fitting distribution. Our results indicate that there was very little impact on the volatility of these markets.

40|$|The {{topographical}} distributions and mobilities of the murine {{histocompatibility antigen}} H- 2 Kk and of concanavalin A (Con A) binding sites {{have been studied}} on a murine lymphoma cell line. The spatial distribution of H- 2 Kk antigens, the average distance between H- 2 Kk antigens and Con A binding sites, and the separation of different determinants on the H- 2 Kk antigen itself were determined by using fluorescence resonance energy-transfer measurements with a dual-laser flow sorter. From the lack of energy transfer between bound monoclonal anti-H- 2 Kk antibodies conjugated with fluorescein (donor) and rhodamine (acceptor), we conclude that the H- 2 Kk antigen exists without appreciable clustering on the cell surface. Substantial energy transfer between appropriately labeled Con A and antibodies bound to the H- 2 Kk antigen shows that the two populations are interspersed. Donor/acceptor pairs of monoclonal antibodies binding to different determinants on the same H- 2 Kk antigen exhibited a degree of energy transfer indicative of a mean separation of 8. 6 nm between the sites. Time-resolved phosphorescence anisotropy measurements with anti-H- 2 Kk antibodies labeled with eosin or erythrosin yielded rotational mobility information for the antigen-antibody complexes on the cell membrane. The rotational correlation time of 10 - 20 µ s and the finite residual anisotropy are compatible with an uniaxial mode of rotation of monomeric antigen around its transmembrane portion and, thus, provide additional evidence for an unclustered <b>distribution.</b> <b>Capping</b> by rabbit anti-mouse IgG immobilized the antigen-antibody complex.

40|$|Abstract Background When {{calculating the}} number of deaths {{attributable}} to alcohol consumption (i. e., {{the number of}} deaths that would not have occurred if everyone was a lifetime abstainer), alcohol consumption is most often modelled using a <b>capped</b> exposure <b>distribution</b> so that the maximum average daily consumption is 150 grams of pure alcohol. However, the effect of <b>capping</b> the exposure <b>distribution</b> on the estimated number of alcohol-attributable deaths has yet to be systematically evaluated. Thus, the aim {{of this article is to}} estimate the number of alcohol-attributable deaths by means of a capped and an uncapped gamma <b>distribution</b> and <b>capped</b> and uncapped relative risk functions using data from the European Union (EU) for 2004. Methods Sex- and disease-specific alcohol relative risks were obtained from the ongoing Global Burden of Disease, Comparative Risk Assessment Study. Adult per capita consumption estimates were obtained from the Global Information System on Alcohol and Health. Data on the prevalence of current drinkers, former drinkers, and lifetime abstainers by sex and age were obtained from various population surveys. Alcohol-attributable deaths were calculated using Alcohol-Attributable Fractions that were calculated using capped (at 150 grams of alcohol) and uncapped alcohol consumption <b>distributions</b> and <b>capped</b> and uncapped relative risk functions. Results Alcohol-attributable mortality in the EU may have been underestimated by 25. 5 % for men and 8. 0 % for women when using the <b>capped</b> alcohol consumption <b>distribution</b> and relative risk functions, amounting to the potential underestimation of over 23, 000 and 1, 100 deaths in 2004 in men and women respectively. Capping of the relative risk functions leads to an estimated 9, 994 and 468 fewer deaths for men and for women respectively when using an uncapped gamma distribution to model alcohol consumption, accounting for slightly less than half of the potential underestimation. Conclusions Although the distribution of drinkers in the population and the exact shape of the relative risk functions at large average daily alcohol consumption levels are not known, the findings of our study stress the importance of conducting further research to focus on exposure and risk in very heavy drinkers. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introducing the HNV farming concept The {{concept of}} “High Nature Value farming ” {{developed}} in the early 1990 s from a growing recognition that the conservation of biodiversity in Europe depends on the continuation of low-intensity farming systems across large areas of countryside (see Beaufoy et al., 1994; Bignal et al., 1994; Bignal & McCracken, 1996; 2000). A fundamental shift in the <b>distribution</b> of <b>CAP</b> funds away from more intensive farming was recommended, {{in order to provide}} support for these beneficial landuses. With the exception of a minority of Member States, this shift has not yet occurred. The idea was that CAP support should be weighted in favour of low-intensity farming systems throughout the EU territory, and that this would provide a robust basis for biodiversity conservation in Europe. Eligibility for support payments would depend on simple criteria applied {{at the level of the}} farm holding, such as livestock density. It was not intended that support payments for low-intensity farming should be provided only in delineated “HNV areas”. Farming intensity and biodiversit...|$|R

The modelling framework is based on the concept of market imperfections and transaction costs.

However, the <b>distribution</b> of <b>CAP</b> rents are affected by the institutional structure. We find an adverse impact on allocation of incomes and welfare that are generated by the integration in Slovakia and in the Czech Republic. The major part of it - between 65 % to 93 % - is transferred to owners of production factors, such as hired labour, landowners and variable capital suppliers, but not as desired to support farmer incomes.

The kinetics of the enzymatically induced pH increase were studied by monitoring pH, calcium concentration and conductivity of the aqueous solutions as a function of time, urease concentration and initial concentrations of calcium and phosphate ions. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy was used to study the process of homogeneous CaP precipitation in solution, whereas CaP deposition on conventional acid-etched titanium and micropatterned polystyrene (PS) surfaces was studied using scanning electron microscopy. The data presented in this study confirm that the substrate–enzyme combination urea–urease offers strong control over the rate of pH increase by varying the concentrations of precursor salts and urease. Formation of biomimetic CaP coatings was shown to proceed via formation of ionic polymeric assemblies of prenucleation complexes. The process of deposition and corresponding coating morphology was strongly dependent on the concentration of calcium, phosphate and urease.

Among these, sleep alterations have recently emerged as potential markers of depression and other psychiatric conditions.

Intriguingly, sleep in children at high risk for depression has only scarcely been evaluated and research on this topic is still at an early stage. For these reasons, the present study was aimed at comparing electrophysiological features and CAP micro-architecture of sleep between a group of twenty children born to mothers with MDD and a group of eleven sex- and age-matched controls.

40|$|A novel {{theoretical}} model of dynamic instability {{of a system}} of linear (1 D) microtubules (MTs) in a bounded domain is introduced for studying the role of a cell edge in vivo and analyzing the effect of competition for a limited amount of tubulin. The model differs from earlier models in that the evolution of MTs is based on the rates of single unit (e. g., a heterodimer per protofilament) transformations, in contrast to postulating effective rates/frequencies of larger-scale changes, extracted, e. g., from the length history plots of MTs. Spontaneous GTP hydrolysis with finite rate after polymerization is assumed, and theoretical estimates of an effective catastrophe frequency as well as other parameters characterizing MT length <b>distributions</b> and <b>cap</b> size are derived. We implement a simple cap model which does not include vectorial hydrolysis. We demonstrate that our theoretical predictions, such as steady state concentration of free tubulin, and parameters of MT length distributions, are in agreement with the numerical simulations. The present model establishes a quantitative link between microscopic parameters governing the dynamics of MTs and macroscopic characteristics of MTs in a closed system. Lastly, we use a computational Monte Carlo model to provide an explanation for non-exponential MT length distributions observed in experiments. In particular, we show that appearance of such non-exponential distributions in the experiments can occur because the true steady state has not been reached, and/or due to the presence of a cell edge.

40|$|The {{rationale}} {{for the present study}} was to develop porous CaP/silk composite scaffolds with a CaP-phase distribution and pore architecture better suited to facilitate osteogenic properties of human bone mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) and in vivo bone formation abilities. This was achieved by first preparing CaP/silk hybrid powders which were then incorporated into silk to obtain uniform CaP/silk composite scaffolds, by means of a freeze-drying method. The composition, microstructure and mechanical properties of the CaP/silk composite scaffolds were ascertained by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a universal mechanical testing machine. BMSCs were cultured in these scaffolds and cell proliferation analyzed by confocal microscopy and MTS assay. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteogenic gene expression were assayed to determine if osteogenic differentiation had taken place.
