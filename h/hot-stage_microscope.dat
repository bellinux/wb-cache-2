40|$|AbstractHot-stage {{microscopy}} (HSM) - {{a technique}} {{widely used in}} material sciences - coupled with commercial image analysis software is proposed as an alternative and simple approach for quantifying the foaming kinetics during the formation of metallic foams by the powder metallurgical (PM) method. The foaming process is performed inside the <b>hot-stage</b> <b>microscope.</b> The sample of small dimensions is continuously monitored by a TV camera and its shape is recorded on a videotape. The captured HSM images are analysed by image-analysis procedures to obtain the expansion curve of the sample from the variation of its projected area. Apart from the expansion curves, this technique also enables observing the thermal events occurring onto the external surface skin of the foams detecting coalescence events that could provoke structural imperfections...|$|E

The processes of lamellar perfection, e. g. lamellar thickening and merging of lamellar fragments, are revealed during the secondary crystallization stage. It is shown that {{the information contained in}} SPM images can be comparable to that of time-resolved small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). In addition, SPM opens the way to examine subtle structural changes that would certainly be overlooked in the global morphological parameters obtained from a simple SAXS correlation function analysis. © 2000 The American Physical Society.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{determining}} {{the criteria for}} defect formation {{during the early stages}} of thermal binder removal within an ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) polymer filled with submicron SiC ceramic powder. The only product of the early stage thermal degradation reaction of EVA within an inert atmosphere is acetic acid. This single component and well characterized organic reaction product has allowed the defect forming criteria to be definitively examined. It will be shown that bloating occurs {{in the early stages of}} binder removal as a result of pressure build-up in the specimen resulting from acetic acid formed from the thermal elimination reaction of EVA. The first part of this paper examines defect formation occurring in the pure polymer within a <b>hot-stage</b> optical <b>microscope.</b> Bubble formation is observed in the pure polymer. Next, bloating occurring in the molded system is examined. The affect of mineral oil on bloating is also discussed as well as the effect that molding pressure has on bloating. It was found that molding pressure effects defect formation. Finally, this paper presents binder removal maps that were developed for specimens up to 8 mm thick. These bloating maps indicate the existence of two primary bloating regimes...|$|R
40|$|Estimates of the {{magnitudes}} of elastic {{stresses and}} elastoplastic stresses and strains {{were made for}} tungsten fiber-reinforced 80 Ni + 20 Cr matrix composites. Heating or cooling between 80 and 2000 F was assumed. The calculated elastic stresses exceeded representative or estimated strengths of constituents. For composites with less than 0. 65 volume fraction of fiber, plastic flow was considered possible, and elastoplastic solutions indicated that stresses would be reduced but with the concomitant occurrence of sufficiently large strain ranges, particularly in the matrix, to pose a possible thermal fatigue problem. Limited experimental studies on tungsten fiber-copper matrix composites heated and cooled {{a number of times}} between 80 and 1600 F in a conventional furnace and then heated from 80 to 1652 F in a <b>hot-stage</b> <b>microscope</b> resulted in matrix microfracture for a 70 volume fraction fiber composite and substantial matrix strain for a 40 volue fraction fiber composite...|$|E
40|$|We studied {{nucleation}} {{and crystal}} growth in two polypropylene samples {{by analyzing the}} number of spherulites, their size, and shape for various treatments in a <b>hot-stage</b> <b>microscope.</b> The consistency of nucleation and growth data were tested by using Q 1 overall crystallization experiments and the Jonhson–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov equation. In isothermal conditions, for temperatures, TC, varying between 1238 and 1388 C, the number of crystallites per unit area {{does not depend on}} crystallization time and temperature. Instead, at small undercoolings (for TC. 1388 C), the total number of nuclei per unit area remains independent of crystallization time, but decreases with increasing temperature. We discuss the implications of this finding for the final microstructure of the crystallized samples. It is noteworthy that the passage between these two nucleation behaviors coincides with the transition from regime III to regime II, observed in the crystal growth kinetic analysis. This remarkable correlation betwee...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} reactions {{involved in the}} corrosion of MgO CaZrO 3 –calcium silicate materials by cement clinker were studied using a <b>hot-stage</b> <b>microscope</b> up to 1600 ◦ C. The phases formed at 1500 ◦ C were characterized by RLOM and SEM–EDS of the crystalline phases conducted near the reaction front and on unreacted refractory area. The general corrosion mechanism of attack on MgO CaZrO 3 –calcium silicate materials involves a mechanism of matter diffusion of the liquid clinker phase through the grain boundaries and pores into the refractory substrate. The liquid phases in the clinker mainly enriched in calcium, iron and aluminium are rapidly diffused and preferentially react with magnesium spinel, calcium zirconate and magnesia, which are the major constituents in the refractory substrates. The dissolution of the CaZrO 3 refractory phase produces the enrichment with zirconium of the liquid phase increasing its viscosity and hindering the liquid phase diffusion...|$|E
40|$|Chromium oxide gel {{material}} was synthesised {{and appeared to}} be X-ray amorphous. The changes {{in the structure of the}} synthetic chromium oxide gel were investigated using hot-stage Raman spectroscopy based upon the results of thermogravimetric analysis. The thermally decomposed product of the synthetic chromium oxide gel in nitrogen atmosphere was confirmed to be crystalline Cr 2 O 3 as determined by the hot-stage Raman spectra. Two bands were observed at 849 and 735 cm- 1 in the Raman spectrum at 25 °C, which were attributed to the symmetric stretching modes of O-CrIII-OH and O-CrIII-O. With temperature increase, the intensity of the band at 849 cm- 1 decreased, while the band at 735 cm- 1 increased. These changes in intensity are attributed to the loss of OH groups and formation of O-CrIII-O units in the structure. A strongly hydrogen bonded water H-O-H bending band was found at 1704 cm- 1 in the Raman spectrum of the chromium oxide gel, however this band shifted to around 1590 cm- 1 due to destruction of the hydrogen bonds upon thermal treatment. Six new Raman bands were observed at 578, 540, 513, 390, 342 and 303 cm- 1 attributed to the thermal decomposed product Cr 2 O 3.

40|$|A {{combination}} of high-resolution thermogravimetric analysis coupled to a gas evolution mass spectrometer {{has been used}} to study the thermal decomposition of metazeunerite {Cu(H 2 O) (4) }(H 2 O) (4) [UO 2) (AsO 4) ](2). Five stages of weight loss are observed at 48, 88, 125, 882 and 913 degreesC. In the first three stages 2, 4 and 2 mol of water are lost. In stages 4 and 5, some As 2 O 5 units are lost and it is probable that reduction of the anhydrous phase Cu[(UO 2) (AsO 4) ](2) occurs. The stages of dehydration were confirmed by the use of evolved water vapour mass spectroscopy. Changes in the structure of metazeunerite were followed by the use of Raman microscopy in conjunction with a thermal stage. Two Raman bands are observed at 818 and 811 cm(- 1) and are assigned to the nu(2) symmetric stretching modes of the UO 2 units. The UO 2 Raman antisymmetric stretching mode was observed at 890 cm(- 1). No AsO 4 stretching vibrations were observed until after two stages of dehydration of the metazeunerite. The AsO 4 nu(4) bending modes show complexity with bands observed at 463, 446, 396 and 380 cm(- 1). Thermal treatment results in the removal of this degeneracy. The nu(2) band of the AsO 4 units is observed at 320 cm(- 1). Raman bands at 275 and 235 cm(- 1) are attributed to the nu(2) bending modes of the (UO 2) 2 (+) units.

During the 1 st century AD, glass and pigments manufacturing industry was active along the Gulf of Naples, Italy, where we sampled four littoral sands. Samples were analyzed with different techniques: chemical analysis was performed by means of X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and mineralogical analyses with X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD) and Raman Spectroscopy. The complete sintering to melting thermal behaviour of the four sands was studied by heating microscopy or <b>hot-stage</b> <b>microscope</b> (HSM) equipped with an high resolution camera capable to collect sample profile during heating. The effect of the grain size on the sintering curves, which were automatically elaborated by specimen profile transformation, was also investigated. Finally, some deductions about the granulometry effect and the presence of alkaline and alkaline-earth oxides on sintering and melting behaviour were drawn. All the four sands were found suitable for highly sintered manufacts rather than glasses, to reach complete amorphous materials the addition of fluxes was necessary...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the flow {{characteristics}} of Indian Blast furnace slag is necessary to study the softening and melting phenomenon in the blast furnace which highly affects the size and position of the cohesive zone. It also affects the operation in the blast furnace, hot metal quality and the consumption of the reductant. In the current work, the flow characteristics of high alumina synthetic slag (Al 2 O 3 25 %) are determined by Leitz-Wetzlar high temperature microscope resembling different Indian blast furnace slag. The C/S ratio was varied from 0. 9 - 1. 2 and MgO was varied from 4 - 10 %. It was observed that the softening, hemispherical and flow temperature increases {{with an increase in}} the C/S ratio. Increase in the MgO content increases both softening and flow temperature. In addition, an effective statistical model is developed through constructing empirical equations by regression analysis method to predict softening temperature (ST), hemispherical temperature (HT) and flow temperature (FT) based on CaO/SiO 2 ratio, MgO and Al 2 O 3 content. Calculated values of ST, HT and FT using this empirical relation based model correspond well with results obtained experimentally from <b>hot-stage</b> <b>microscope.</b> This well validated statistical model based on empirical equations will be useful in predicting the flow characteristics temperature for blast furnace slag...|$|E

The low-temperature monoclinic form is {{best described as}} a nonmerohedral twin with similar to 50 % contributions from its two components. The thermal behavior of the dipeptide crystals was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry experiments. Visual changes in birefringence of the sample during heating and cooling cycles on a <b>hot-stage</b> <b>microscope</b> with polarized light supported the phase transition. Variable-temperature unit cell check measurements from 300 to 100 K showed discontinuity in the volume and cell parameters near the transition temperature, supporting the first-order behavior. A detailed comparison of the room-temperature orthorhombic form with the low-temperature (100 K) monoclinic form revealed that the strong hydrogen-bonding motif is retained in both crystal systems, whereas the non-covalent interactions involving side chains of the dipeptide differ significantly, leading to a small change in molecular conformation in the monoclinic form {{as well as a}} small reorientation of the molecules along the ac plane. A rigid-body thermal motion analysis (translation, libration, screw; correlation of translation and libration) was performed to study the crystal entropy. The reversible nature of the phase transition is probably the result of an interplay between enthalpy and entropy: the low-temperature monoclinic form is enthalpically favored, whereas the room-temperature orthorhombic form is entropically favored...|$|E
40|$|Aluminum-lithium alloys have {{extraordinary}} properties. The {{addition of}} lithium to an aluminum alloy decreases its density, while making large increases in its strength and hardness. The down side {{is that they}} are unstable at higher temperatures, and are subsequently difficult to weld or even manufacture. Martin Marietta, though, developed an aluminum-lithium alloy 2195 that was reported to have exceptional properties and good weldability. Thus, it was chosen as the alloy for the space shuttles super light external tank. Unfortunately, welding 2195 {{has turned out to be}} much more of a challenge than anticipated. Thus, research has been undergone in order to understand the mechanisms that are causing the welding problems. Gas reactions have been observed to be detrimental to weld strength. Water vapor has often been identified as having a significant role in these reactions. Nitrogen, however, has also been shown to have a direct correlation to porosity. These reactions were suspected as being complex and responsible for the two main problems of welding 2195. One, the initial welds of 2195 are much weaker than the parent metal. Second, each subsequent welding pass increases the size and number of cracks and porosity, yielding significant reductions in strength. Consequently, the objective of this research was to characterize the high-temperature reactions of 2195 in order to understand the mechanisms for crack growth and the formation of porosity in welds. In order to accomplish that goal, an optical <b>hot-stage</b> <b>microscope,</b> HSM, was used to observe those reactions as they occurred. Surface reactions of 2195 were observed in a variety of environments, such as air, vacuum, nitrogen and helium. For comparison, some samples of Al- 2219 were also observed. Some of the reacted surfaces were then analyzed on a scanning electron microscope, SEM.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryPaul A. SeibYong Cheng ShiWaxy {{wheat starch}} {{contains}} almost all amylopectin and is relatively new. Currently, advanced lines of hard winter waxy wheats are being bred through genetic elimination of waxy proteins. To realize the full potential of waxy wheat, the wet-milling of waxy wheat flour to produce gluten and waxy wheat starch was investigated. Flours of six advanced lines of waxy hard wheats and two normal hard wheats cultivars, Karl ' 92 and Trego, were fractioned by the dough-washing method. Doughs prepared from the waxy flours {{were found to}} be weaker than those of from normal wheats. All the waxy wheat and normal wheat flours were wet-milled by the dough-washing (Martin) process and the yield and recovery of starch and gluten were compared. One waxy wheat flour, NWX 02 Y 2459, was sticky during the early stages of dough washing, and it gave relatively poor gluten and starch recoveries with low purity. By mixing the dough with 2 % NaCl solution or by adding hemicellulase, the stickiness of the dough subsided during the washing step, and thereby recoveries of the gluten and starch fractions were improved. Waxy wheat starch offers unique functional properties. Waxy wheat starches gelatinize and cook at a relatively low temperature compared to maize starches, and their pastes retrograde more slowly and to a lower extent than waxy maize starch. Pasting curves showed that waxy wheat starch generated a much higher viscosity at a lower temperature, and a lower setback viscosity than normal wheat starch and waxy maize starch. Changes in the morphology of waxy and normal wheat starch granules were determined by using a <b>hot-stage</b> <b>microscope,</b> and those changes were related to their pasting properties. After waxy wheat starch was cross-linked in an aqueous slurry at about 37 % starch solids with 0. 01 % phosphoryl chloride (starch basis), visco-amylograms showed that viscosity breakdown was eliminated and that the cooked paste became non-cohesive (less "stringy"). Increasing levels of phosphoryl chloride at 0. 03 % and 0. 06 % caused a steady decline in the peak and final paste consistencies of cross-linked waxy wheat starch, whereas the consistencies of waxy maize starch proceeded through an optimum. Waxy maize starch cross-linked with 0. 03 % phosphoryl chloride had a higher peak and final consistency at 7 % solids than when cross-linked with 0. 01 % and 0. 06 % phosphoryl chloride...|$|E
