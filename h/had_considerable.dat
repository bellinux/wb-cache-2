5|$|As well as {{providing}} {{power for the}} tram system, the station {{was a source of}} electricity for local homes. The building of a power station brought major environmental improvements to what was a highly polluted area, because electricity represented a much cleaner source of household energy than coal, which was used at the time. Local households gradually switched to the new power source. A partner in the enterprise of the Lemington power station was Sir Matthew White Ridley, who <b>had</b> <b>considerable</b> interests in coal and banking.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{benefits}} of the Project, many CVP operations have <b>had</b> <b>considerable</b> environmental consequences, including a decline in the salmon population of four major California rivers, and the reduction of riparian zones and wetlands. Many historical sites and Native American tribal lands have been flooded by CVP reservoirs. In addition, runoff from intensive irrigation has polluted rivers and groundwater. The Central Valley Project Improvement Act, passed in 1992, intends to alleviate some of the problems associated with the CVP with programs like the Refuge Water Supply Program.|$|E
5|$|Laurence Olivier (1907–1989) was an English actor who, {{along with}} his contemporaries Ralph Richardson and John Gielgud, {{dominated}} the British stage of the mid-20th century.

5|$|An {{independent}} {{company at}} this time had a nominal strength of 20 officers and 275 other ranks. Larger than a conventional infantry company, it was organised into three platoons, each of three sections, each of which contained two subsections. It <b>had</b> <b>considerable</b> firepower. Each subsection had a Bren light machine gun. The gunner's two assistants carried rifles and extra 30-round Bren magazines. A sniper also carried a rifle, as did one man equipped with rifle grenades. The remaining four or five men carried Owen submachine guns. Each platoon also had a section of 2-inch mortars.|$|E

5|$|Anton Meyer is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the BBC medical drama Holby City, played by actor George Irving. He {{appeared in the}} series from its first episode, broadcast on 12 January 1999, until series four, episode 46, broadcast on 20 August 2002. His role in the show is that of consultant cardiothoracic surgeon {{and head of the}} cardiothoracic surgery department at Holby General. Irving <b>had</b> <b>considerable</b> input in creating the character, who was initially envisioned by the series producers as an Iranian surgeon named Hussein. At Irving's suggestion, Meyer became Hungarian, an emigrant to Britain following the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Little of the backstory created for Meyer was ever revealed on-screen, as part of a deliberate bid to present the character as enigmatic, allowing viewers to project their own imagination onto him.|$|E
5|$|As a {{case study}} of disinformation, the authors {{describe}} journalist , whose publication in France was secretly financed by Soviet intelligence. Its contents were biased against the Western world in favor of the Soviet agenda, and <b>had</b> <b>considerable</b> impact on public opinion. In another example, the authors bring forth an analysis of the World Peace Council, which operated as a front organization for Soviet intelligence. They discuss its operations negatively impacting both NATO and the U.S. Shultz and Godson back up their analyses with interviews from two Soviet officials who had defected from their posts in Soviet intelligence, and spoke of disinformation campaigns against Western interests.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, women had a very limited legal status. A married woman had few property rights and could not make a will without her husband's permission, although jurists expected this to be given. Men <b>had</b> <b>considerable</b> latitude in disciplining the women under their authority and although a handful of cases turn up in higher courts, and the kirk session did intervene to protect women from domestic abuse, it was usually only when the abuse began to disturb public order. The criminal courts refused to recognise women as witnesses, or as independent criminals, and responsibly for their actions was assumed to lie with their husbands, fathers and kin. As a result, a married woman could not sell property, sue in court or make contracts without her husband's permission.|$|E

If the agent were able to fulfil the work at a lower cost he could keep the remainder of the money. If unforeseen problems arose and these were reasonable, Brassey would cover these additional costs. He used hundreds of such agents. At the peak of his career, for well over 20 years, Brassey was employing on average some 80,000 people in many countries in four continents.|$|E
5|$|Darwin was a {{prolific}} writer.

While On the Origin of Species dominates perceptions of his work, The Descent of Man and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals <b>had</b> <b>considerable</b> impact, and his books on plants including The Power of Movement in Plants were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms.|$|E

5|$|In {{political}} terms, {{the practical}} benefits were minimal, the dangers considerable. Less than 2% of Scots were professed Catholics who already <b>had</b> <b>considerable</b> freedom {{to practice in}} private, a point made by James himself. The opening of Catholic chapels in Edinburgh allowing public celebration of the Mass led to riots and made private worship more difficult. Attempts to build support by expanding the measures benefitted dissident Presbyterians while undermining his Episcopalian base. When James failed to get Parliament's approval, he confirmed popular prejudice linking Catholicism and arbitrary rule by using the Royal Prerogative to promote Catholics to key government positions.|$|E

The {{first and last}} storms of the season were largely insignificant, although the second, fourth, and fifth storms <b>had</b> <b>considerable</b> effects. Two hurricanes struck the United States: a major hurricane that struck Texas and Louisiana in late September, disrupting the Louisiana Maneuvers, and Hurricane Five, which made two landfalls in Florida, {{the first of which}} was near Miami at Category 2 intensity, inflicting widespread damage. Another major storm—Hurricane Four—traversed the Caribbean before striking the Nicaragua–Honduras border at Category 4 intensity, leaving 47 men dead at sea.|$|E
5|$|James Clark Ross's 1839–43 Antarctic {{expedition}} in HMS Erebus and HMS Terror was {{a full-scale}} Royal Naval enterprise, the principal function {{of which was}} to test current theories on magnetism, {{and to try to}} locate the South Magnetic Pole. The expedition had first been proposed by leading astronomer Sir John Herschel, and was supported by the Royal Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Ross <b>had</b> <b>considerable</b> past experience in magnetic observation and Arctic exploration; in May 1831 he {{had been a member of}} a party that had reached the location of the North Magnetic Pole, and he was an obvious choice as commander.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, it {{was decided}} that the battalion's key positions, {{including}} its officers, non commissioned officers (NCOs) and signallers, would initially be filled largely by New Zealanders of European descent. This decision was met with some consternation, so assurances were made that over time suitable Māori candidates would take over these positions. In this regard, {{it was decided}} that the battalion's first commanding officer would be a regular officer, Major George Dittmer—later promoted to lieutenant colonel in January 1940—and that his second-in-command would be a Reserve officer, Lieutenant Colonel George Bertrand, a part-Māori who would take up the position with the rank of major.

5|$|Now a centre {{for arms}} manufacture, the castle was made more secure, {{with a new}} {{defensive}} ditch, freshly repaired walls and a new chapel. The castle was garrisoned with royal troops during the uprising of Richard Marshal against Henry III in 1233–4, suggesting it <b>had</b> <b>considerable</b> military value at this time. Another indicator of the military importance of the castle and the surrounding forest was the £20 fee each year being paid to the constable of the castle by 1287, {{on a par with}} the much larger castles of Rhuddlan or Nottingham.|$|E
5|$|Rupert is {{probably}} best remembered today {{for his role as}} a Royalist commander during the English Civil War. He <b>had</b> <b>considerable</b> success during the initial years of the war, his drive, determination and experience of European techniques bringing him early victories. As the war progressed, Rupert's youth and lack of maturity in managing his relationships with other Royalist commanders ultimately resulted in his removal from his post and ultimate retirement from the war. Throughout the conflict, however, Rupert also enjoyed a powerful symbolic position: he was an iconic Royalist Cavalier and as such was frequently the subject of both Parliamentarian and Royalist propaganda, an image which has endured over the years.|$|E
