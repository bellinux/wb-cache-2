25|$|Upon {{watching}} {{the tape of}} the beating, LAPD chief of police Daryl Gates said: <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> screen in disbelief. I played the one-minute-50-second tape again. Then again and again, until I had viewed it 25 times. And still I could not believe what I was looking at. To see my officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something I never dreamed I would witness.|$|E
60|$|He held up {{his huge}} paws, and as <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> battered, malformed {{knuckles}} I understood {{the nature of his}} work.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> two men intently. There was {{certainly}} {{nothing of the}} policeman about them. I should never have suspected them of being official personages.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> stockishly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> girl, {{who passed}} with an {{indifferent}} face.|$|R
5000|$|Krizz Kaliko copied {{lyrics of}} the song {{for the first few}} lines of his song [...] "Anxiety," [...] off his debut album Vitiligo by saying, [...] "When Im alone in my room, {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wall/And {{in the back of my}} mind, I hear my conscious call/Telling me I need a gun." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> {{bottom of}} the {{staircase}} <b>I</b> stood and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> worn steps, and Ayesha, turning, saw me.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> man dumbly. His eye was clear, {{his hand}} steady. He {{had none of}} the {{appearance}} of a butler who has had a couple.|$|E
60|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> old fellow, for {{how could}} he know {{of the death of}} this man, but thought it useless to pursue the {{conversation}} further.|$|E
6000|$|I {{grasped the}} axe with shaking hands, [...] <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> grass I trod; For I feared {{to see the}} whole bare heavens [...] Filled with the face of God.|$|E
60|$|The cup {{of coffee}} was arrested half-way to my lips as <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> in amazement <b>at</b> <b>the</b> man's serious face.|$|R
6000|$|This, then, was the {{explanation}} of <b>the</b> stealthy expeditions <b>at</b> night and <b>the</b> light <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window. Sir Henry and <b>I</b> both <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> woman in amazement. Was it possible that this stolidly respectable person was of the same blood {{as one of the}} most notorious criminals in the country? ...|$|R
60|$|I was so {{amazed at}} this sight that I could not speak. <b>I</b> could only <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{place where the}} huge monster had gone down.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fool!" [...] I said, {{and stirred}} the {{crackling}} mass into a featureless heap of black scraps. Then with my chin on my fists and elbows on knees <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{end of my}} labours.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> man, astounded. I {{was deeply}} moved. Well, I mean, wouldn't any chap {{who had been}} going about {{thinking}} that the old feudal spirit was dead and then suddenly found it wasn't have been deeply moved? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{work and}} had not an idea. Then it flashed on me with such suddenness and {{certainty}} that I am convinced {{the answer to the}} riddle was passed to me from her and did not originate in my own mind.|$|E
6000|$|As <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Belfry, <b>I</b> {{think with}} a sort of smile of some of my friends in London who are quite sure of how {{children}} will turn out if you give them what they call [...] "the right environment." [...] It is a troublesome thing, environment, for it sometimes works positively and sometimes negatively, and more often between the two. A beautiful environment may make a child love beauty; it may make him bored with beauty; most likely the two effects will mix and neutralise each other. Most likely, that is, the environment will make hardly any difference <b>at</b> all. In <b>the</b> scientific style of history (which was recently fashionable, and is still conventional) we always had a list of countries that had owed their characteristics to their physical conditions.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him. Surely <b>the</b> war had {{affected}} the little man's brain. He was carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on, and seemed wholly engrossed in the task.|$|R
6000|$|As I stood up, booted {{and ready}} to descend, there came a gentle tap at my door, and, in answer to my [...] "Enter," [...] there stood before me a very dainty and foppish figure. <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> hard <b>at</b> <b>the</b> effeminate face and the long fair locks of my visitor, {{thinking}} that I had become the dupe of my eyes.|$|R
60|$|They {{both went}} out, and <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> steward {{clearing}} the table. There {{was nothing to}} be read on that wretched man's face. But why did he avoid my eyes I asked myself. Then I thought I should like to hear the sound of his voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Eat the cake," [...] I answered. [...] "And why do {{you wish}} to kill us? Be so good as to tell me the truth now, or I shall read it in the magic shield which portrays the inside as well as the out," [...] and lifting the cloth <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> glass.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> distant houses. For {{the first}} time since our {{starvation}} in the crater I thought of earthly food. [...] "Bacon," [...] I whispered, [...] "eggs. Good toast and good coffee.... And how the devil am I going to all this stuff to Lympne?" [...] I wondered where I was. It was an east shore anyhow, and I had seen Europe before I dropped.|$|E
60|$|George had a quick {{rejoinder}} to {{his letter}} of excuse to Haslam, {{so we had}} not his company yesterday, which I was sorry for as there was our old set. I know three witty people all distinct in their excellence--Rice, Reynolds, and Richards. Rice is the wisest, Reynolds the playfullest, Richards the out-o'-the-wayest. The first makes you laugh and think, the second makes you laugh and not think, the third puzzles your head. I admire the first, I enjoy <b>the</b> second, <b>I</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> third. The first is claret, the second ginger-beer, the third crÃªme de Byrapymdrag. The first is inspired by Minerva, the second by Mercury, the third by Harlequin Epigram, Esq. The first is neat in his dress, the second slovenly, the third uncomfortable. The first speaks adagio, the second allegretto, the third both together. The first is Swiftean, the second Tom-Crib-ean, the third Shandean. And yet these three eans are not three eans but one ean.|$|R
60|$|For {{indeed it}} was he, and not Clausel, who stood in the doorway. And to this day I {{do not know if}} Alain or <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him with <b>the</b> blanker bewilderment; though I believe there was a {{significant}} difference in our complexions.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> {{in amazement}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> speaker, {{but even in}} the dim light I {{recognized}} her. This was the human being whose expected presence <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Collingwood mansion was taking me there to spend Christmas.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> slow eddies that circled {{above the}} {{departed}} Maud Mary, {{and the last}} chance of Business Organisations. I felt weary beyond emotion. I thought of my heroics to Beatrice and my uncle, of my prompt [...] "I'LL go," [...] {{and of all the}} ineffectual months I had spent after this headlong decision. I was moved to laughter at myself and fate.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked hard}} at Harry {{as he walked}} in silence at my side; <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> houses we passed; I thought of the cab, the gas lighted hall in the Palace of Aladdin, the pictures, the letter, the oath, the dirk; the mysterious place where all these mysteries had occurred; and then, was almost ready to conclude, that the pale yellow wine had been drugged.|$|E
60|$|The {{eyes on the}} pavement, in the trams, the cabs, at {{the upper}} windows, swept our lines {{back and forth with}} a weighed {{intensity}} of regard which at first seemed altogether new to me, till I recalled just such eyes, a thousand of them, at manoeuvres in the Channel when one crowded battleship drew past its sister at biscuit-toss range. Then <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ground, overborne by those considering eyes.|$|E
60|$|She retired {{into the}} back part of her shop beyond the muslined door and {{returned}} with a tumbler of water. I shook my head. My sight pulsed with my heartbeats. As if congealed into a drop of poison, <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> and <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> blind.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a case of}} life imitating art, Proof {{himself was}} shot and killed on April 11, 2006 after an altercation broke out at a nightclub in Detroit, Michigan. [...] "In the year after he (Proof) died, <b>I</b> would <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ceiling and think about that video (Like Toy Soldiers). Did karma cause that to happen in real life? Did I? You always want to point <b>the</b> finger <b>at</b> {{somebody}} else when something like that happens, you know?" ...|$|R
60|$|Now, so amazed was I that <b>I</b> {{paused to}} <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{officer who was}} young enough {{to make such a}} {{proposal}} to a man of my reputation. He turned his face towards me, and in the moonlight I could make out his questioning glance.|$|R
60|$|There {{were several}} {{padlocked}} dispatch-boxes, and, {{on a shelf}} above, a bundle of folded papers. I took this bundle carefully out {{and laid it on}} the table before me. I was on the point of undoing the red tape with which it was tied, when my fingers became suddenly rigid. <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> packet with wide-open eyes. I felt my breath come short and my brain reeling. The papers were there sure enough, but it was not at them that I was looking. It was the double knot in the pink tape which fascinated me.|$|E
60|$|It {{was great}} news, and the {{possible}} downfall of my enemy perhaps the least of it. It implied swift prosperity for all that district, and while <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> speaker the blood surged to my forehead. Though fate had robbed me of the best, part of what I had toiled, and fought, and suffered for was to come about at last; and the calmness of the others appeared unnatural. Haldane's eyes were keen, but he {{showed no sign of}} unusual interest; Boone's face was merely grim, and I guessed that the man whose heel had been on my neck would fare ill between them.|$|E
60|$|She {{drank the}} water at a draught, with the avidity of raging thirst, and let herself fall on the nearest chair, as if utterly overcome. Her attitude, like certain tones of her voice, had in it {{something}} masculine: the knees apart in the ample wrapper, the clasped hands hanging between them, her body leaning forward, with drooping head. <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> heavy black coil of twisted hair. It was enormous, crowning the bowed head with a crushing and disdained glory. The escaped wisps hung straight down. And suddenly I perceived that the girl was trembling from head to foot, as though that glass of iced water had chilled her to the bone.|$|E
6000|$|Propped on {{my hands}} and knees, fearful that Mrs Bowater might {{interrupt}} me before I was prepared, <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> fixedly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> newspaper. <b>I</b> understood all that it said, yet it was as strange to me {{as if it had been}} written in Hebrew. I had seen, I had known, Mr Crimble. Who, then, was this? My throat drew together as I turned my head a little and managed to inquire, [...] "What is an inquest, Mrs Bowater?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> foot of {{the dais}} {{crouched}} a figure which at first I took {{to be that of}} some dead one also embalmed, perhaps a wife or daughter of the dead Inca who had been set with him in this place. While <b>I</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> it <b>the</b> figure stirred, having heard our footsteps, rose and turned, standing so that the light from the hanging lamp fell full upon it. It was Quilla clad in white and purple with a golden likeness of the Sun blazoned upon her breast! ...|$|R
5000|$|Carlton {{told the}} website Contactmusic.com {{of the first}} time she watched the single's music video, in which she is seen playing the piano while {{traveling}} through a variety of settings: I was in the studio and had just taken a break, when someone ran in the room and said, [...] "You're on MTV!" [...] We put it on and <b>I</b> just <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> screen. After a few minutes, I just covered my eyes and started to laugh. It seemed so surreal. The night after that, I heard the song on the radio for the first time. It was all so unbelievable.|$|R
