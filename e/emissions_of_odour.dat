40|$|Natural {{materials}} of biological origin may deteriorate {{over time and}} affect perceived air quality negatively. As examples of natural products, linoleum, wall paint and floor oil, all materials containing linseed oil, were investigated. Odorous emissions from these materials were compared with emissions from similar conventional synthetic materials containing no linseed oil. The materials were followed {{over a period of}} one year and the odorous emissions were evaluated by a sensory panel that assessed odour intensity and acceptability and by chemical analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbonyl compounds. Materials containing linseed oil affected the perceived air quality more negatively than the selected similar synthetic materials and the odour was persistent over time. The concentration of some odour active VOCs decreased rapidly whereas the concentration for others remained constant over the one-year period. This may explain the persistence of the odour. The materials containing linseed oil did not qualify for the Danish Indoor Climate Label. There is a potential for lowering the <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> active compounds from the investigated materials that contained linseed oil, by systematic use of less odorous linseed oils...|$|E

In order to study odour and ammonia concentrations and emissions at different climatic conditions a small scale poultry house (climate chamber) was equipped with a floor housing system were 356 laying hens were kept. Temperature was set to about 12, 15, 20, and 25 ° C and ventilation rate was set to values between 0. 9 and 5. 3 m 3 h- 1 hen- 1.

40|$|Intensive {{livestock}} production {{is connected with}} a number of environmental effects, including discharges to soils and surface waters and emissions to the atmosphere. In areas with a high livestock density the low availability of nearby arable land, together with the preferred use of chemical fertilizer by arable farmers, results in high off-farm disposal costs for manure. Furthermore, ammonia abatement technologies, such as treatment of exhaust air, are important as ammonia emissions may account up to a quarter of the total nitrogen flux. Firstly, the paper describes and discusses the development of manure treatment in the Netherlands since the 1970 ¿s. Manure treatment processes that result in products that compete with and replace the use of chemical fertilizers can (partly) close the nutrient cycle again. From this point of view aerobic treatment of manure (nitrification/denitrification) can not be considered sustainable as nitrogen is taken out of the cycle at high environmental costs. Secondly, the state-of-the-art of techniques for treatment of exhaust air is presented. Besides ammonia, application of air treatment may also reduce environmental <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> and particulate matter (dust). Both manure treatment and treatment of exhaust air are considered essential for sustainable livestock operations in areas with a high livestock density...|$|E

The digestion process resulted in an increase of the pH (by 8 - 10 %) and the NH 4 +-N (by 6 - 25 %) of the slurry for all three experiments. The dry matter and organic matter content of the slurry was lower in the digested slurry compared to the conventional slurry {{in the first two}} experiments (dry matter: 32 - 61 % lower; organic matter: 36 - 64 % lower). In the third experiment, differences in dry matter content between both slurries were not significant. The application of digested slurry resulted in higher NH 3 emissions (a factor 1. 9 in experiment 1, a factor 1. 5 in experiment 2) compared to conventional slurry during the first two experiments. For experiment 3, {{due to the lack of}} wind during the night of the first day after the application of the slurry it was not possible to calculate accurately the cumulative emission from the plots. The cumulative NH 3 emission was in general high when compared to previous measurements reported in the literature for experiments using shallow injection.

40|$|Compared {{to other}} species of farm animals, pigs are more {{sensitive}} to high environmental temperatures, because they cannot sweat and do not pant so well. Furthermore, fast-growing lean pigs generate more heat than their congeners living in the wild. This, in combination with confined housing, {{makes it difficult for}} these pigs to regulate their heat balance. Heat stressed pigs have low performance, poor welfare, and, by pen fouling, they give higher <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> and ammonia. Above certain critical temperatures (inflection point temperatures) pigs start to adapt their mechanisms of balancing heat loss and heat production. The inflection point temperatures above which the responses change may well differ depending on which animal parameter is studied. Within this thesis, firstly, these critical temperatures were determined for different physiological, behavioral and production parameters.   Secondly, the effect of different cooling systems on these parameters was studied. In order of appearance we found inflection point temperatures for lying on slatted floor, respiration rate, evaporative water, ratio of water to feed intake, total heat production, activity heat production, voluntary feed intake and rectal temperature. These inflection point temperatures were different for the different parameters and show the subsequent strategies the pig follows at increasing temperatures. Relative h umidity had minor effects on physiological parameters. However, a combination of high relative humidity and high temperature showed a detrimental effect on daily gain. The availability of cooling systems, e. g. floor cooling, water bath or sprinklers, had beneficial effects on pigs' performance. It is concluded that high ambient temperatures strongly affect physiology, behaviour and performance of growing pigs. The inflection point temperatures found in this study are good indicators of heat stress. These can be used as set points for cooling systems.

40|$|Since limited studies {{exist on}} the <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>odours</b> from tunnel {{ventilated}} broiler sheds under the Australian climate, this research study aims to determine the key odorants in the headspace of litter at ambient temperature across the poultry production cycle in two seasons (winter and summer) using headspace sampling coupled to TD-GC-MS/O analysis. Dynamic dilution olfactometry analysis was performed on litter odour samples producing odour concentrations ranging from 1421 to 115372 OU/m 3 and from 604 to 104379 OU/m 3 for winter and summer litters with greatest emission encountered from winter caked wet litter that sustained high amount of water and low pH. Analysis of litter odorant composition employing headspace sampling coupled to TD-GC-MS/O provided {{a greater understanding of}} the fate of odorants in the litter during bird growth cycle. The study also showed that characterise odorous volatiles can be correlated with dynamic dilution olfactometry responses. The results revealed that the odorous contributions were ketones, volatile fatty acids, sulfur and nitrogen compounds that were highly offensive substances, which impose significant effect on the odour annoyance from the emissions compared to other chemical functionalities. The assessment of activated carbon, silica gel and zeolite as a potential odour reducing strategy was directly applied to litters. The studies exhibited mixed trends in chemical and sensory responses and selectivity in reducing the volatilisation of odorants attributed to the efficacy of the additive itself, heterogeneous condition of litter particles in contact with the reduction materials and the exposed surface area. Based on the chemical and sensory responses, activated carbon and silica gel exhibited noticeable interactions on excessively wet litter with trial litters appeared remarkably drier and friable than the control and zeolite sets. However, complete elimination <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> or decrease in odour hedonic tone was unachievable mainly due to <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> ammonia from trial sets. Therefore, it is evident that no one product is capable of reducing or removing all volatiles presents in the <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> <b>odours</b> from poultry shed litter.

The link between diet and {{odour emissions}} was studied in two experiments using Ross 308 male meat chickens reared in specially designed chambers in a climate controlled room. In the first experiment, two treatments were compared using three replicates of two birds per chamber. Two wheat-soy based treatment diets were formulated with or without canola seed, an ingredient rich in sulfur amino acids. Treatment 1 (T 1) had 13. 39  MJ/kg ME (as fed) and used 60  g/kg canola seed without corn while Treatment 2 (T 2) contained 12. 90  MJ/kg ME (as fed) and used 150  g/kg corn without canola seed. In the second experiment, birds were assigned to three dietary treatments of five replicates with five birds per replicate (chamber). The basal starter, grower and finisher diets {{in the control group}} (SBM group) contained soybean meal in the range of 227 – 291  g/kg (as fed) as the main protein source. The other treatments (CM and MBM groups) contained either high levels of canola meal (174 – 190  g/kg) or meat meal (74 – 110  g/kg) at the expense of soybean meal. In both experiments, diets were isocaloric, isonitrogenous and contained similar digestible amino acid contents as per 2007 Aviagen Ross 308 guidelines. <b>Emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> were measured using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy.

In the first experiment, T 1 (with canola seed) produced higher concentration of methyl mercaptan (P <  0. 05) and lower diacetyl (P <  0. 01) than T 2. In the second experiment, methyl mercaptan emission was higher in SBM group (P =  0. 01) and total elemental sulfur were higher in SBM and CM groups up to day 24 (P <  0. 01).

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this dissertation work was to optimize the performance of biotrickling filters in reducing <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> and harmful substances from swine facilities. The parameters and operating conditions that have {{significant impact on the}} treatment process were identified through a modelling study. Key odour components were selected to serve as model pollutants, which were identified from linear relationships between the logarithm of odour emission and the logarithm of pollutant emission/odour intensity and from odour indices. The potential model pollutants identified were ammonia, dimethyl sulphide, and p-cresol. 	Different sets of shake-flask experiments were conducted to assess different inocula, to determine the optimum pH, and to estimate the biokinetic parameters for the biodegradation of ammonia and p-cresol. Among the three inocula evaluated, the complex inoculum taken from an existing biotrickling filter showed the best performance in terms of p-cresol and ammonium reduction. The results also showed that the highest p-cresol uptake and reduction rates and NO 3 - production rate were at pH 7. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} biodegradation of p-cresol was better described by the Monod equation (R 2 = 0. 96) with estimated values of 0. 10 h- 1 for µm and 103. 4 mg L- 1 for Ks. The biodegradation of ammonia, on the other hand, was better described by the Haldane equation (R 2 = 0. 72) with estimated values of 0. 17 h- 1 for µm, 11. 9 mg L- 1 for Ks, and 617. 9 mg L- 1 for Ki. Mass balance equations were formulated to describe the processes occurring in the gas, liquid, and biofilm phases of the treatment system. The differential equations were solved using the finite difference numerical analysis method. A one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify parameters that have significant impact on ammonia removal. Calibration and validation results showed good agreement between predicted and measured values; based on the fractional bias (FB) results, the normalized model’s prediction errors were within ± 1 to 7 %.

40|$|The growing {{awareness}} {{of the impact of}} environmental conditions on quality of life has led to the consideration <b>of</b> <b>odours</b> as atmospheric contaminants causing “olfactory pollution”. Odorous compounds do not directly represent a risk to human health; they are rarely dangerous in nature, not necessarily toxic, and generally found at low concentrations. Nevertheless it has been recognized that exposure to odours may cause different negative effects on human beings, ranging from emotional stress to physical symptoms. Consequently, when a system characterized by high <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>odours</b> is located in an urban context, its acceptance by the population is affected by its olfactory impact.

The dumping site is in ownership by the Province of Zuid Holland and operated by de 'Afvalverwerkingsinrichting Derde Merwedehaven' (AVM). The dumping site is situated at {{a short distance from}} residential areas. For this reason strict conditions have been formulated for the operation of the dumping site. In course of time however the amount of biological degradable material, that has been dumped, was much larger than planned, resulting in a higher production <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> and methane than was expected. For this reason a methane extraction system was realised in parts of the dumping site. From the moment the dumping site was put into use there were complaints about an unpleasant smell. The number of complaints showed a very high increase from November 17 th. 1998. This {{was the result of the}} malfunctioning of the methane extraction system as a result of the unusual high amount of precipitation in the autumn of 1998. A second increase in the number of complaints took place in the period starting on January 30 th 1999. In this situation RIVM was asked by the Province of Zuid Holland to answer the following questions: 1. What is the opinion of RIVM about the technical aspects of the methane extraction system 2. What is the opinion of RIVM about the measures taken to reduce the odour emission 3. How does RIVM evaluates the pattern of complaints in the period from November 17 th 1998 till march 31 st 1999. With regard to the methane extraction system the opinion is, that the philosophy and technical realisation from the existing part of the system are good. In the part of the system that has been constructed recently, the distance between the extraction units is possibly to high. From the measures that can be taken to reduce <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> most have been realised. A number of improvements however are suggested. The pattern of complaints shows that the increase in the number of complaints is associated with the occurrence of two special circumstances: the malfunctioning of the methane extraction system in November 1998 and the activities related to the construction of a new part of the methane extraction system, which started in January 1999. There are however structural causes for the annoyance caused by the dumping site also. These are the unfavourable location of the dumping site, the fact that more gas is produced than was anticipated and the relatively high hydrogen sulphide concentration in this gas. For these reasons <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> will take place relatively soon and these emission will relatively quick lead to odour complaints.

Results Our chemical analyses of floral scents show that the Ophrys F 1 hybrids investigated here produce more compounds, significantly different ratios (% <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> compounds in the total blend), as well as new compounds in their floral odour compared to their progenitors. When tested for their attractiveness to the pollinator of each parent orchid species, we found that floral scent extracts of the hybrids triggered less inspecting flights and contacts by the male bees with the scented dummy than those of the parental orchid species. However, a series of additional behavioural bioassays revealed that the novel floral scent of the hybrids was significantly more attractive than either of the two parents to a pollinator species not initially involved in the pollination of any of the parent Ophrys species. Conclusions Collectively, our results illustrate that the process of hybridisation can lead to the generation of evolutionary novelties, and that novel combinations of floral traits can drive pollinator shifts and rapid reproductive isolation in highly specific plant-pollinator interactions. </p...|$|R
5000|$|John Knight (Animal By Products) Ltd., {{based in}} Silvertown, London, was fined {{for the third}} time in three years in October 2012 at Thames Magistrate’s Court. Newham Council {{received}} around 300 formal complaints during 2011 from local residents concerning smells emanating from the factory. The fine of £120,000 plus £66,150 costs is believed to be the largest fine ever obtained by a local authority for an offense of this nature under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The company was found guilty of nine counts of failing to properly prevent <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> offensive <b>odours</b> beyond the factory boundary in breach of its regulatory Environmental Permit. [...] The company were previously fined £75,000 with £75,000 costs in 2011 due to odours emitted from the factory and £10,000 with £10,500 costs in 2009 when a pile of meal was left outside rotting.|$|R
40|$|Ammonia {{emission}} {{from animal}} husbandry {{has to be}} reduced in the Netherlands by 70 % in the year 2005, compared with the emission level in 1980. Moreover, new odour legislation requires measurements <b>of</b> the <b>odour</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> the main conventional and newly developed housing systems. Research was carried out into the <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> ammonia and <b>odour</b> from a naturally ventilated and animal friendly house for pregnant sows. The reducing principle of this house was based on separation of the dunging area by providing a comfortable and spacious lying area with straw bedding. The pens housed 8 sows and provided individual feeding boxes for each of them. The research was carried out during a summer and winter period. The <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> ammonia from the house amounted to 6. 3 (summer period) and to 5. 5 (winter period) kg/year per animal with 5 % correction for under-occupation. The odour emission was 26. 1 OUE /s per animal...|$|R
40|$|Among the {{industrial}} activities that may cause odour nuisance problems, rendering plants represent {{one of the}} most critical sources <b>of</b> smelly gaseous <b>emissions</b> and consequently <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> complaint. In this work, the odour emission factors (OEFs) for the rendering industry are determined based on experimental data obtained by means of dynamic olfactometry. An OEF is a representative value that relates the quantity <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> released to the atmosphere to a given associated activity. The odour emission factors were calculated to be equal to 4. 52 × 108 ouE t− 1 for process air, to 8. 02 × 107 ouE t− 1 for a mixture of process air and ambient air, and to 3. 53 × 103 ouE t− 1 for wastewater treatment tanks. Furthermore, the efficiencies <b>of</b> different <b>odour</b> abatement systems used for the treatment <b>of</b> different gaseous <b>emissions</b> from this kind of facility are evaluated and compared. The abatement efficiencies <b>of</b> the monitored <b>odour</b> reduction systems decrease passing from combustors (efficiencies over 99 %) to biofilters (efficiencies between 73 and 80 %) and scrubbers (efficiencies between 41 and 60 %) ...|$|R
50|$|Geotrichum candidum is {{extremely}} common in soil {{and has been}} isolated from substrates in Canada, United States, Britain, Germany, Austria, India, South Africa, Japan, Brazil and Peru. It is also found as a causal agent in sour rot in citrus fruits— a soft rot associated with the <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> a fruity <b>odour.</b> The fungus {{is also known as}} a post-harvest spoilage agent of muskmelon, squash and cucumber. It plays a role in tomato fruit rot when it is stored at 0-5 C. It is a naturally occurring colonist of certain dairy products particularly cheeses and is sometime used to inoculate wash-rind and bloomy rind cheeses.|$|R
40|$|A newly {{developed}} drying technique was successfully tested on large scale. It could be demonstrated that drying of pulp from sugar beets {{in a closed}} system with fluidised bed and with further use of the generated secondary steam for sugar production saves 85 to 90 pct. of primary energy {{in comparison with the}} existing drying technique which uses direct heating with burners. Emissions are reduced proportionally. In addition <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> dust and <b>odour</b> from the drying process are also decreased drastically due to the closed system of the drying unit.

40|$|The {{concentration}} of sewage at wastewater treatment sites, {{as well as}} the retention and treatment thereof, in facultative and maturation ponds leads to the <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> odorants. Although <b>odour</b> <b>emissions</b> from wastewater sources do not generally cause direct health-related problems, a preliminary study of the existing literature has found that, because odour elicits a physiological response it can cause psychological stress. Furthermore, current legislation defines odours that adversely affect the amenity of an area as environmental nuisance. There is currently a buffer zone around each of the major wastewater treatment sites in the Darwin region. These buffer zones exist to limit development adjacent to wastewater infrastructure sites to reduce the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> complaints. Due to the number, and distribution, of recent complaints from residents living near wastewater treatment sites, but outside the buffer zone, it is unclear whether, or not, the extent of current buffer zones is sufficient to minimise the exposure of the surrounding community to <b>odour.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this thesis is to determine the suitability <b>of</b> current <b>odour</b> buffer zones surrounding wastewater infrastructure in the Darwin region. A combination <b>of</b> three different <b>odour</b> assessment techniques will be used to achieve this. These techniques are: odour dispersion modelling, field olfactometry, and odour complaint mapping. Odour dispersion modelling involved entering meteorological, emission, and terrain data for each site into an odour dispersion model. This was done to develop a probabilistic <b>odour</b> impact assessment <b>of</b> odorants emanating from a defined source. Field olfactometry was undertaken to ground-truth the dispersion model while gaining an empirical understanding <b>of</b> how <b>odour</b> from wastewater treatment sites is affecting the surrounding residents (and generating complaints). Odour complaint mapping is an on-going process involving mapping the location <b>of</b> complaints regarding <b>odour.</b> It was initially used to help to select appropriate testing locations for field olfactometry by examining clusters of complaints...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} four systems for abatement of particulate matter (PM) emission inside full-scaled commercial poultry houses: a fixed oil spraying system (OSF) inside two broiler farms and one laying hen house, an autonomously driving oil spraying vehicle (OSV) in one laying hen house, a negative air ionisation system (NAI) inside two broiler farms, and a positive air ionisation system (PAI) inside two laying hen houses. The systems were evaluated using case-control approaches. At each farm, six 24 -h measurements were scheduled of PM 10, PM 2. 5, ammonia, odour, and carbon dioxide concentrations (the latter for estimation of the ventilation rate and herewith emissions). This paper presents {{the layout of the}} systems, compares their performance in practice with that under experimental conditions, discusses improvement possibilities, reports the baseline <b>emission</b> rates <b>of</b> the poultry houses, and discusses the validity of the case-control approaches. The <b>emission</b> reductions <b>of</b> PM 10 and PM 2. 5 were: 60 % and 53 % for the OSF in broilers (at 12 mL m − 2 d − 1), 21 % and 31 % for the OSF in laying hens (at 15 mL m − 2 d − 1), 32 % and 38 % for the OSV in laying hens (at 30 mL m − 2 d − 1), 49 % and 68 % for the NAI in broilers, and 6 % and zero for the PAI in laying hens. None of the systems significantly reduced the <b>emission</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>odour</b> or ammonia. On the basis <b>of</b> this work, <b>emission</b> reduction factors <b>of</b> the OSF, OSV, and NAI have been adopted in Dutch regulations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Composting is an aerobic {{microbiological}} {{process that is}} facilitated by bacteria and fungi. Composting is also a method to produce fertilizer or soil conditioner. Tightened EU legislation now requires treatment of the continuously growing quantities of organic municipal waste before final disposal. However, some full-scale composting plants experience difficulties with the efficiency of biowaste degradation and with the <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> noxious <b>odours.</b> In this study we examine the bacterial species richness and community structure of an optimally working pilot-scale compost plant, {{as well as a}} full-scale composting plant experiencing typical problems. Bacterial species composition was determined by isolating total DNA followed by amplifying and sequencing the gene encoding the 16 S ribosomal RNA. Results: Over 1500 almost full-length 16 S rRNA gene sequences were analysed and of these, over 500 were present only as singletons. Most of the sequences observed in either {{one or both of the}} composting processes studied here were similar to the bacterial species reported earlier in composts, including bacteria from the phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Deinococcus-Thermus. In addition, a number of previously undetected bacterial phylotypes were observed. Statistical calculations estimated a total bacterial diversity of over 2000 different phylotypes in the studied composts...|$|R
