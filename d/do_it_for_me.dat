500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{gave the}} episode a 7.4 out of 10 rating, writing that he [...] "merely" [...] liked the episode. [...] "It wasn't nearly as fun as I had {{hoped it would}} be. I mean, {{if you were going}} to bring Floyd back and name the episode after him, it would have been nice to give [...] a little spark." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin gave it a C rating, calling it [...] a disappointing episode. In regards to Jason Sudeikis, Rabin commented that he is a [...] "gifted comic actor" [...] but this episode [...] "found him at his hammy, embarrassing worst." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, remarked that the episode [...] "may have been the worst one yet", and said that when Floyd [...] called Liz a [...] "badger", her heart broke into smithereens, [...] "There's mean-funny, and then there's plain old mean. [...] Liz's love life has become the central butt of the joke on 30 Rock... and it's starting to feel like the writers have run out of ways to be funny without being sadistic." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said that [...] "Floyd" [...] was not a great episode, [...] "but it's still pretty good by this season's standards, if a somewhat disappointing use of Floyd's return." [...] He explained that part of the episode's problem was that Liz's relationships not succeeding [...] "has become pretty old hat for the show since we've seen it time and time again", and hoped to see her [...] "find a good man and let the show move onto something else for a while." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel wrote that it [...] "really didn't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I didn't really laugh out loud much, and the cameo from one of my favorite SNL players came off a bit forced." ...|$|E

2500|$|While Ivey {{was gaining}} recognition, {{and was able}} to quit his day job, he was notorious for his {{reluctance}} to attend opening parties, do publicity, or seek out commissions, and for his gruff, workmanlike approach to painting. [...] "Painting is something you have to do all the time," [...] he told arts journalist Regina Hackett in a 1992 interview. [...] "If you don't, it becomes too important, too charged with meaning, and you can't bring yourself to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> it's like tying my shoes in a way." ...|$|E

30|$|Because people <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> Very {{early in}} my career some {{incredibly}} talented, competitive individuals took time out {{of the day and}} helped me along with my business planning, my hiring strategies, my financing plans, when I got myself stuck in a jam they answered my phone calls. They didn’t <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a fee or to sit on my board or to be a paid advisor. They <b>did</b> <b>it</b> because they had something to give back to the community. It’s that simple; someone <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and I just feel like the only way I can thank those individuals… is to give back to those early stage companies.|$|R

2500|$|Yevtushenko {{became one}} of the best known poets of the 1950s and 1960s in the Soviet Union. He was part of the 1960s generation, which {{included}} such writers as Vasili Aksyonov, Andrei Voznesensky, Bella Akhmadulina, Robert Rozhdestvensky, Anatoly Gladilin; as well as actors Andrei Mironov, Aleksandr Zbruyev, Natalya Fateyeva, and many others. During the time, Anna Akhmatova, a number of whose family members suffered under the communist rule, criticised Yevtushenko's aesthetic ideals and his poetics. The late Russian poet Victor Krivulin quotes her saying that [...] "Yevtushenko doesn't rise above an average newspaper satirist's level. Yevtushenko and [...] Andrei Voznesensky's works just don't <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> therefore neither of them exists for me as a poet." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, {{giving it a}} C+. In her recap, she cited that the episode was weak in the delivery, saying [...] " [...] I’ve already complained about how the Merida storylines aren’t <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> {{through no fault of}} the actress playing her, I just don’t think the Brave canon has much to offer as Merlin’s, say." ...|$|R
6000|$|Arthur nodded. [...] "There {{are a few}} {{accounts}} which I must pay," [...] he said. [...] "So I'm {{going to}} ask Plimsoll to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> He's a decent fellow of his sort, you know! Lots of fellows go to him!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The fact is, Mr. Clement, she don't seem to {{care about}} living--that's what scares me. She's just as sweet and lovely as an angel.

500|$|On his {{approach}} to casting, Stallone {{said that he was}} looking for actors who had not experienced recent success in film: [...] "I like using people that had a moment and then maybe have fallen on some hard times and give them another shot. So we’re always looking for actors like Michael Biehn and Michael Paré. I like those kinds of guys.

60|$|My inn {{had once}} been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house, and I dined in a little {{octagonal}} common-room, like a font.
