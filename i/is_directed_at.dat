5|$|In 2000, Ariel {{became an}} {{official}} {{member of the}} newly launched Disney Princess line, an umbrella franchise that includes various Disney princesses under its banner. Ariel {{is one of the}} original 8 characters that were included at the franchise's launch.

5|$|Costly {{signalling}} can {{be applied}} to situations involving physical strain and risk of physical injury or death. Research on physical risk taking is important because information regarding why people, especially young men, take part in high risk activities can help in the development of prevention programs. Reckless driving is a lethal problem among young men in western societies. A male who takes a physical risk is sending the message that he has enough strength and skill to survive extremely dangerous activities. This signal <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> peers and potential mates.|$|E
5|$|Most {{art historians}} {{believe that there}} are a number of {{indicators}} that the panel was the left-hand wing of a dismantled diptych. The frame contains clasps, implying it was once hinged to a second panel. The work seems composed to be symmetrically balanced towards an accompanying right-hand wing: Mary is positioned slightly to the right of centre, while her downward, almost coy glance <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> a space beyond the edge of the panel, suggesting that she is looking at, or in the direction of, a kneeling donor in a right-hand wing. The visible architectural features – with the exception of the niches, the crucifixion and the windows directly behind it, which are at a right angle to the nave and centre front, facing the viewer – are at the left of the panel, facing right.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of outward directedness moods might <b>be</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> either {{the world as a}} whole, a {{changing}} series of objects in the world, or unbound emotion properties projected by people onto things in the world. In {{the case of}} inward directedness moods <b>are</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> the overall state of a person’s body. In the case of hybrid directedness moods <b>are</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> some combination of inward and outward things.|$|R
30|$|Signs {{provided}} by the Ministry of Education, classified as top-down, are written mainly in Hebrew. In a few cases, when the author was an Arab, and the message <b>was</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> an Arab audience, the sign was written in Arabic. Another authority, or top-down actor, is the municipality. Signs {{provided by}} the municipality were bilingual (Arabic-Hebrew). Regarding the school principal as another authority making top-down decisions about many signs inside the school, various patterns were detected: Arabic-only when the message <b>was</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> students; Hebrew-Arabic when the message <b>was</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> visitors as well as students; and sometimes Hebrew-only when it <b>was</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> teachers. The bottom-up signage, written by students, was mainly in Arabic only.|$|R
50|$|Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham was {{met with}} a {{generally}} mixed reception upon release. Praise <b>was</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> the amount of content, the game's humour, and the characters, while criticism <b>was</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> technical issues, poor AI, celebrity cameos, conflicting gameplay aspects, and the game's overall direction.|$|R

25|$|USPSTF {{recommends}} high-intensity behavioral {{counseling for}} all sexually active adolescents and for adults {{at increased risk}} for STIs. Such interactive counseling, which can be resource intensive, <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> a person's risk, the situations in which risk occurs, and the use of personalized goal-setting strategies.|$|E
25|$|In {{those who}} are not palliative the primary {{treatment}} of shortness of breath <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> its underlying cause.

25|$|In Europe, the FP7 {{research}} program has more subsidies for nuclear than for renewable and energy efficiency together; over 70% of this <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> the ITER fusion project. In the US, public research money for nuclear fission declined from 2,179 to 35 million dollars between 1980 and 2000.|$|E
25|$|A laser Doppler {{vibrometer}} (LDV) is a non-contact {{instrument for}} measuring vibration. The laser beam from the LDV <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> {{the surface of}} interest, and the vibration amplitude and frequency are extracted from the Doppler shift of the laser beam frequency due to {{the motion of the}} surface.|$|E
25|$|There is no vaccine. Prevention {{requires}} isolating {{those who}} are infected and decreasing contact with the rats. Efforts include having a cat to hunt vermin, and storing food in sealed containers. Treatment <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> addressing dehydration and improving symptoms. The antiviral medication, ribavirin may be useful when given early. These measures improve outcomes.|$|E

25|$|Usually no causative {{abnormality}} can {{be identified}} and treatment <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> the symptom, rather than a specific mechanism. However, there are known causes of abnormal uterine bleeding {{that need to be}} ruled out. Most common causes based on the nature of bleeding is listed below followed by the rare causes of bleeding (i.e. disorders of coagulation).|$|E
25|$|One common example {{involving}} {{centripetal force}} {{is the case}} in which a body moves with uniform speed along a circular path. The centripetal force <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> right angles to the motion and also along the radius towards the centre of the circular path. The mathematical description was derived in 1659 by the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens.|$|E
25|$|Some {{press reports}} have {{characterized}} this law {{as the first}} piece of legislation in the People's Republic of China to cover an individual's right to own private assets, although this is incorrect, as the right to private property was written into the PRC Constitution in 2003, and the law itself <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> defining all forms of property in the PRC.|$|E

25|$|Treatment <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> the person's symptoms. For dry eyes {{artificial}} tears, {{medications to}} reduce inflammation, punctal plugs, or surgery {{to shut the}} tear ducts, may be tried. For a dry mouth, chewing gum (preferably sugar free), sipping water, or a saliva substitute may be used. In those with joint or muscle pain, ibuprofen may be used. Medications that can cause dryness, such as antihistamines, may also be stopped.|$|E
25|$|This {{book has}} become a {{standard}} textbook in many countries, and is often cited as a reference in research articles. The book was published in 1990 by Academic Press. Its aim is to give an introduction {{to one of the}} most dynamic areas of modern mathematics. It <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> first and second year graduate students intending to specialise in research in operator algebras and at interested researchers from other areas, especially quantum physicists.|$|E
25|$|In all of {{the above}} situations, {{immunity}} <b>is</b> <b>directed</b> <b>at</b> the transplanted organ, sustaining lesions. A cross-reaction test between potential donor cells and recipient serum seeks to detect presence of preformed anti-HLA antibodies in the potential recipient that recognize donor HLA molecules, so as to prevent hyperacute rejection. In normal circumstances, compatibility between HLA-A, -B, and -DR molecules is assessed. The higher the number of incompatibilities, the lower the five-year survival rate. Global databases of donor information enhance the search for compatible donors.|$|E
