6000|$|The {{point is}} that Dr. Munro denies the {{parallelism}} between the Clyde and Portuguese objects. Yet I must hold that stone figurines of women, grotesque <b>heads</b> <b>in</b> <b>stone,</b> cupped stones, stones with cup and duct, stones with rays proceeding from a central point, and perforated stones with linear ornamentation, are rather [...] "parallel," [...] in Portugal and in Clydesdale.|$|R

60|$|So far the Scottish and the Portuguese fakers {{have hit}} on {{parallel}} lines of fraud. Meanwhile I know of no archaeologists except Portuguese archaeologists, who have seen the objects from the dolmen, and of no Portuguese archaeologist who disputes their authenticity. So there the matter rests. {130} The parallelism appears {{to me to be}} noticeable. I do not say that the styles of art are akin, but that the artists, by a common impulse, have produced cupped stones, perforated and inscribed <b>stones,</b> figurines <b>in</b> <b>stone,</b> and grotesque <b>heads</b> <b>in</b> <b>stone.</b>|$|R

6000|$|In Portugalia, a Portuguese archaeological magazine, {{edited by}} Don Ricardo Severe, {{appeared}} {{an article by}} the Rev. Father Jose Brenha on the dolmens of Pouco d'Aguiar. Father Raphael Rodrigues, of that place, asked Father Brenha to excavate {{with him in the}} Christmas holidays of 1894. They published some of their discoveries in magazines, and some of the finds were welcomed by Dr. Leite de Vasconcellos, in his Religioes da Lusitania (vol. i. p. 341). They dug in the remote and not very cultured Transmontane province, and, in one dolmen found objects [...] "the most extraordinary possible," [...] says Father Brenha. {128} There were perforated plaques with alphabetic inscriptions; stones engraved with beasts of certain or of dubious species, very fearfully and wonderfully drawn; there were stone figurines of females, as at Dumbuck; there were stones with cups and lines connecting the cups, (common in many places) and, as at Dumbuck, there were grotesque <b>heads</b> <b>in</b> <b>stone.</b> (See a few examples, figs. 20-24).|$|R

5000|$|The head can be handmade, cast or die struck, {{and it is}} {{made from}} some type of {{precious}} metal, such as gold, silver and platinum. Heads used to prong set a gemstone {{come in a variety}} of sizes and shapes, depending on the shape of the gemstone, the size of the gemstone, or whether or not the gemstone is faceted or cabochon shaped. Common shapes of <b>heads</b> used <b>in</b> <b>stone</b> setting include round, oval, emerald cut, princess cut, marquise cut, pear shaped and trillian cut. V-shaped prongs are recommended for a marquise-cut or pear-shaped stone, while flat prongs are recommended for a flat-cut emerald. [...] A prong setting holds the gem securely while allowing the gem to be struck with more light and from more angles, increasing the brilliance of the gemstone.|$|R
50|$|The {{other main}} focus of the city center is the Museo Regional Tuxteco (Tuxtla Regional Museum). This museum was founded in 1961 to display and {{preserve}} the area’s pre Hispanic and colonial heritage, coming under {{the management of the}} Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia in 1975. The museum building was renovated in the 2010s. The museum building is the former “municipal palace” (city hall) which was constructed in 1880 with an arched portico. Inside there are three main halls. Two of these are dedicated mostly to Olmec pieces, including colossal stone sculptures as well as some Totonac pieces, all from Veracruz. One of the most important pieces is the Hueyapan Head, a 20-ton colossal <b>head</b> <b>in</b> volcanic <b>stone.</b> The third hall is dedicated to pieces related to the area’s colonial history.|$|R

Fortunately, the governor, who was greedy, found a treasure. To avoid meeting the minister, he used another way out. The loyal dog waited to its death.|$|R
50|$|In 1839 {{a section}} of wall 9 ft high and 12 ft long stood about 180 ft to the {{southeast}} of the church.It had large cut stones at its ends, like the angles of a house gable, and a doorway in the center 4.75 ft high measured from ground level as it then was.The doorway was 1.76 ft wide {{at the top and}} 2.17 ft wide at the foot. This seems to have been the west end or gable of an ancient church.Above the doorway there were three human <b>heads</b> sculpted <b>in</b> <b>stone.</b> The middle one was very badly weathered but the other heads still preserved their features.These Romanesque heads may date to the 15th century.This would mean that the earlier building, identified as Saint Luchtighern's oratory, was renovated around this time, when the church was also renovated. The heads are still visible, but have been re-arranged so the central head is now one that is in good condition.|$|R
50|$|In {{the area}} of Amselholz on Lotterberg, close to Amselhof, there is a horse's grave.

The horses buried here, are not, as was thought for a long time, from the Isabellen - a harnessed team of six belonging to the last Hessian Prince-elector, Friedrich Wilhelm I. Nevertheless, there are still two different stories about how the graves came to be.|$|R

5000|$|Morningthorpe has a {{round tower}} rather {{larger than that}} at {{neighbouring}} Long Stratton: the tower appears to bulge out about halfway up, which, according to the article in Round Tower magazine September 2004, may be evidence of an octagonal tower built inside a round one. The article has photographs of repair work done to the tower in 1988 - one shows a corner of an [...] "octagon" [...] inner tower core, not bonded to the outside, while another suggests a bonded, and rounded, core. There are narrow openings in the tower with monolithic <b>heads</b> <b>in</b> worn pale <b>stone,</b> the openings filled with old-looking wooden boards pierced with vertical rows of round holes. Taylor & Taylor, Anglo-Saxon Architecture seek to assign this tower to the later Saxon period (or earlier Norman).|$|R

2500|$|This site yields {{some of the}} {{earliest}} evidence anywhere for the Roman use of water-powered trip hammers to crush ore (Burnham 1997). The ore was probably crushed on the famous Carreg Pumsaint, a block of stone erected many years ago before the Romans had left the site. There are parallels with similar stones at other ancient Roman mines in Europe, and the hollows in the block were formed by a trip hammer probably worked by a water wheel or a [...] "water lever". Such a water-powered hammer would have been moved regularly as each hollow became too deep, so producing the series of overlapping oval hollows in its surfaces. The hammer head must have been of substantial size judging by the width of the hollows shown in the drawing. The stone is the only example so far discovered at the site, but is not unique, and Burnham refers to others of similar shape from Spain. As one side of the stone became worn, it was simply turned to reveal another side, so the block could be re-used several times. When found years after the Romans had left, in the Dark Ages, it gave rise to the legend of the five saints, who left the impression of their <b>heads</b> <b>in</b> the <b>stone</b> after being found asleep by the devil.|$|R

50|$|The {{church is}} {{constructed}} in flint rubble, and contains some freestone and puddingstone. The dressings are in clunch and re-used Roman bricks. The roofs are tiled. The plan {{consists of a}} nave and chancel, with a south porch and a north vestry. At the west end is a wooden belfry and spire, {{both of which are}} weatherboarded. The east window dates from the 19th century and has three lights containing Decorated-style tracery. In the north wall of the chancel are two two-light windows from the 15th century, and between them is a blocked doorway. There are similar windows in the south wall, and a 15th-century doorway. In the north wall of the nave are two 12th-century windows with semicircular heads, and a doorway from the same period. The doorway contains a door with 12th-century scrolled ironwork. In the south wall are three windows in different styles; a 13th-century lancet window, a 14th-century two-light window, and a small window dating from the 12th century. The south porch is weatherboarded and it leads to a 12th-century doorway with a semicircular <b>head</b> and jambs <b>in</b> <b>stone</b> and Roman brick.

50|$|On a short {{vacation}} to escape his now hectic life in New York City, Stone Barrington set his sight on a lovely and romantic getaway {{to the islands}} of St. Marks. His companion, Arrington Carter, all-round superstar was to join him the next day. Three events would ruin Stone's plans for a romantic boat cruise about the islands and leave him in the mist of a life or death trial. One was the New York weather, snowing in every airport available. Next was the saddening and fearsome ambition of his beau, Arrington Carter, high-profile host and interviewer, who decided to track down another must-have editorial. Last was the sweet and gorgeous All-American girl standing trial for murdering her husband, where if convicted meant death, by hanging. Racing to prove the young widow innocent of any wrongdoing pits Stone against a determined protector standing {{on the verge of}} becoming the next Prime Minister of St. Marks. With little time to work the case, leaving the young woman's <b>head</b> <b>in</b> a balance, <b>Stone,</b> once a police officer, now an up-and-coming lawyer, will do what he does best, defend his client with every skill he has to offer. Stone just hopes he didn't lose the new love of his life for his own fearsome and saddening ambition.|$|R
