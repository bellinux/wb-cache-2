50|$|Sir Edward Fitton, 2nd Baronet, of Gawsworth, died in 1643 without issue; he {{had seven}} sisters, but the nearest male Fitton heir was Alexander's father William. In 1641 Edward made a {{settlement}} creating an entail {{in favour of}} William and his male heirs. This was done against the violent protests of Charles Gerard, son of Edward's sister Penelope, who was the nearest <b>heir</b> <b>by</b> <b>blood.</b> After Edward's death the Gerards tried to hold Gawsworth by force; but {{the progress of the}} English Civil War turned in the Fitton family's favour: as a staunch Royalist Gerard's own estates were forfeited and he left England about 1645, leaving the Fittons in possession until the Restoration.|$|E
50|$|The {{story begins}} by {{introducing}} Paks as a headstrong girl of 18, who leaves {{her home in}} Three Firs (fleeing a marriage arranged by her father) to join a mercenary company and through her journeys and hardships comes {{to realize that she}} has been gifted as a paladin, if in a rather non-traditional way. The deed of the story is that she comes to recognize that her first commander, Duke Kieri Phelan, who was given his dukedom because of his military skill, is actually the rightful <b>heir,</b> <b>by</b> <b>blood,</b> of the kingdom of Lyonya. She also convinces the elves, who knew of Kieri's ancestry, but had not told others of it, that he is actually worthy to be king of this kingdom, which includes both elves and humans. Paksenarrion works, fights, and sacrifices herself until she can see Kieri established as Lyonya's king, over the opposition of evil forces, or gods, and evil humans.|$|E

5|$|Raymond died {{in early}} 1197. His widow, Alice, was Leo of Cilicia's niece and heir. Bohemond III sent Alice and her posthumous son, Raymond-Roupen, to Leo, {{implying}} {{that he wanted}} to disinherit his grandson. Leo of Cilicia persuaded the papal legate, Conrad of Wittelsbach, Archbishop of Mainz, to visit Antioch. On the archbishop's demand, Bohemond III declared Raymond-Roupen his heir and ordered the Antiochene noblemen to swear fealty to the boy. Raymond-Roupen was the only son of the first-born son of Bohemond III and thus <b>heir</b> <b>by</b> primogeniture, but Bohemond was Bohemond III's closest male relative and so <b>heir</b> <b>by</b> proximity of <b>blood.</b>|$|R
50|$|Richard II {{held his}} Christmas court at Woodstock Palace in 1389, and the {{seventeen}} year old Pembroke {{took part in}} the Christmas sports, including jousting. While running a course against Sir John Des, he was struck in the groin by his opponent's lance and subsequently died of his injuries. Upon his death, the Earldom of Pembroke and the Barony of Manny became extinct, while the Barony of Hastings passed to his cousin, John Hastings, 6th Baron Hastings, <b>heir</b> <b>by</b> the half <b>blood</b> through his great grandfather. Also the parish of Tunstall, Kent passed to his cousin Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn. His cousins litigated for years regarding property rights, but resolution was delayed during the minority of Edward Hastings, 7th Baron Hastings, brother of the 6th Baron Hastings. When 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn prevailed at law as <b>heir</b> <b>by</b> the whole <b>blood</b> through his paternal grandmother Elizabeth de Hastings, 7th Baron Hastings refused to pay court costs while the case was on appeal (to not create a presumption of acquiescence based on the contemporary rules of evidence) and was imprisoned in chains.|$|R
50|$|The {{title was}} vacant from 1523 to 1544. In 1523, Louise of Savoy, mother of King Francis I of France, {{challenged}} the succession {{to the estate}} of Suzanne, Duchess of Bourbon, who died childless. She claimed the succession as the <b>heir</b> <b>by</b> proximity of <b>blood,</b> as a descendant of the House of Bourbon through her mother. Seeing no hope of prevailing against the king's mother, the Constable of Bourbon went into the service of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. In 1531, the duchy merged into the royal domain for the first time.|$|R

50|$|Wilhelm, Duke of Urach (1864-1928), {{whose father}} was the morganatic son of a Württemberg prince, had the {{distinction}} of being under consideration for the crowns of five realms at different times: that of the Kingdom of Württemberg in the 1890s, as the senior agnate by primogeniture when it became likely that King William II would die without male descendants, leaving as heir Duke Albrecht of Württemberg, a more distantly related, albeit dynastic, royal kinsman; the Principality of Albania in 1913; the Principality of Monaco at turn of the 20th century, as the next <b>heir</b> <b>by</b> proximity of <b>blood</b> following the Hereditary Prince Louis, until the Monaco succession crisis of 1918 was resolved as the First World War ended; the prospective Grand Duchy of Alsace-Lorraine in 1917; and his abortive election by the Taryba as King Mindaugas II of Lithuania in July 1918. In the event, Duke Wilhelm obtained none of these thrones.|$|R
50|$|Peter II and his wife, Anne of France, {{daughter}} of Louis XI, {{had only one}} surviving child, Suzanne. They made her their heir through a concession from Louis XII of France. Anne, knowing that the Bourbon-Montpensier branch, the next senior branch of the Bourbon family, would pursue their claim, married her daughter to Charles, Count of Montpensier. Their marriage thus consolidated the vast possessions of the Bourbon family. The project, however, failed. Suzanne died childless, and the new king's mother, Louise of Savoy, claimed her inheritance, as <b>heir</b> <b>by</b> proximity of <b>blood.</b> Louise offered to marry the Duke of Bourbon to settle the matter amicably. But Louise of Savoy was already 45 years old, so the duke refused her, with insulting language. The king sided with his mother, driving the duke into a conspiracy with the Emperor and the King of England. Once discovered, he was stripped of his titles and possessions in 1523. With his death in 1527, the line of Bourbon-Montpensier became extinct in the male line. The next senior line, of Bourbon-Vendôme, {{was not allowed to}} inherit the forfeited lands.|$|R

5000|$|The fourth Emperor, Claudius, was {{the first}} to assume the name [...] "Caesar" [...] upon accession, without having been adopted by the {{previous}} emperor; however, he was at least a member <b>by</b> <b>blood</b> of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, being the maternal great-nephew of Augustus on his mother's side, the nephew of Tiberius, and the uncle of Caligula. Claudius in turn adopted his stepson and grand-nephew Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, giving him the name [...] "Caesar" [...] in the traditional way; his stepson would rule as the Emperor Nero. The first emperor to assume the position and the name simultaneously without any real claim to either was the usurper Servius Sulpicius Galba, who took the imperial throne under the name [...] "Servius Galba Imperator Caesar" [...] following the death of the last of the Julio-Claudians, Nero, in 68.
