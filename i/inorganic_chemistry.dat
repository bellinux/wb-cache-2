5|$|In <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemistry,</b> {{hydrides}} {{can also}} serve as bridging ligands that link two metal centers in a coordination complex. This function is particularly common in group 13 elements, especially in boranes (boron hydrides) and aluminium complexes, {{as well as in}} clustered carboranes.|$|E

40|$|A Post-Etch-Residue (PER) {{removal process}} for tank and spray tools has been {{developed}} using a new <b>inorganic</b> aqueous based <b>chemistry.</b> The performance of this new type of polymer remover, Inosolv 400 Fotopur®, on process wafers is compared with other <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemistries</b> such as DSP (Dilute Sulphuric acid hydrogen Peroxide) and DSP+, containing traces of HF. Inosolv 400 Fotopur® has improved polymer removal capabilities. Furthermore Inosolv 400 Fotopur ® does not show any attack of the metal or dielectric layers and is inorganic based and thus environmentally friendly...|$|R
5|$|Following {{the death}} in 1934 of a {{professor}} of technical <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemistry</b> at the Norwegian Institute of Technology, Tronstad was appointed his successor on 17 April 1936, effective from 1 May. At the time, {{he was one of}} the youngest professors in Norway. He was a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters, and in early 1940 he became vice president of the Norwegian Chemical Society. During his short scientific career, Tronstad penned about eighty scientific publications, including fourteen on heavy water-related topics.|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) {{compounds}} {{are characteristic}} of the <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemistry</b> of lead. Even strong oxidizing agents like fluorine and chlorine react with lead to give only PbF2 and PbCl2. Lead(II) ions are usually colorless in solution, and partially hydrolyze to form Pb(OH)+ and finally Pb4(OH)4 (in which the hydroxyl ions act as bridging ligands), but are not reducing agents as tin(II) ions are. Techniques for identifying {{the presence of the}} Pb2+ ion in water generally rely on the precipitation of lead(II) chloride using dilute hydrochloric acid. As the chloride salt is somewhat soluble in water, the precipitation of lead(II) sulfide, by bubbling hydrogen sulfide through the solution, is then attempted.|$|E
5|$|Smuts {{thrived in}} this environment. With these new vistas of {{knowledge}} and learning now revealed that he spared no effort in his attempts to master them. His surviving notebooks from this period reveal the range and breadth of his studies: Latin, Greek, German, the Classics, Optical Physics, <b>Inorganic</b> <b>Chemistry</b> and Metallurgy, Organic Chemistry and Agriculture, and Geology - to name but a few. Once again, as had been the case at Riebeek West, this was not merely study {{for the sake of}} exams - as ever, Smuts continued to study avidly outside the confines of the curriculum.|$|E

5|$|Though {{metallic}} sodium has some important uses, the major applications for sodium use compounds; millions {{of tons of}} sodium chloride, hydroxide, and carbonate are produced annually. Sodium chloride is extensively used for anti-icing and de-icing and as a preservative; sodium bicarbonate is mainly used for cooking. Along with potassium, many important medicines have sodium added to improve their bioavailability; though potassium is the better ion in most cases, sodium is chosen for its lower price and atomic weight. Sodium hydride is used as a base for various reactions (such as the aldol reaction) in organic chemistry, and as a reducing agent in <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemistry.</b>|$|E
5|$|The couple {{moved to}} London in 1933 {{but the city}} {{at the time was}} sooty and foggy. This {{affected}} Mary's health, and after treatment at Guy's Hospital she was transferred to Brompton Hospital, where she had a lung removed. After recovering, she moved to Southampton to stay with her parents for two years, with Denning visiting every weekend. By 1935 she had fully recovered, and the couple bought a house in Tylers Green, Cuckfield, called Fair Close. Their son, Robert, was born on 3 August 1938; he later became a Dean at Magdalen College, Oxford, teaching <b>inorganic</b> <b>chemistry.</b> Mary developed gallstones in 1941, and after an initial recovery had a haemorrhage on 21 November, dying the next morning.|$|E

25|$|The {{environmental}} chemistry of some radioactive {{elements such as}} plutonium {{is complicated by the}} fact that solutions of this element can undergo disproportionation and as a result many different oxidation states can coexist at once.
