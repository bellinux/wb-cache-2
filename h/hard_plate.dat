50|$|A 2013 {{discovery}} has elucidated {{the function}} of the bowhead's large palatal retial organ. The bulbous ridge of highly vascularized tissue, the corpus cavernosum maxillaris, extends along the center of the <b>hard</b> <b>plate,</b> forming two large lobes at the rostral palate.

It is hypothesized that this organ provides a mechanism of cooling for the whale (which is normally protected from the cold Arctic waters by 40 cm or more of fat). During physical exertion, the whale must cool itself to prevent hyperthermia (and ultimately brain damage). It is now believed that this organ becomes engorged with blood, causing the whale to open its mouth to allow cold seawater to flow over the organ, thus cooling the blood.|$|E

40|$|Hydrocoryne iemanja sp. nov. {{was found}} in an aquarium, growing on rhodoliths of coralline algae {{collected}} on the southeastern coast of Brazil (20 degrees 40 `S 40 degrees 2 `W). The colonies were reared through maturity in the laboratory. Each colony had up to 7 sessile, long and thin monomorphic zooids, very extensible and flexible, arising from a chitinous, hard dark-brown plate with minute spines. Medusae budded from near the basal part of hydrocaulus, and were released in immature condition, acquiring fully developed interradial gonads 5 - 7 days after release. Asexual reproduction by longitudinal fission was observed on the hydrocaulus of the polyps, both for those in normal condition and those with injuries. Fission started at the oral region, extending aborally, with a new <b>hard</b> <b>plate</b> formed in the basal part of hydrocaulus. When fission reached the new <b>hard</b> <b>plate,</b> the new polyp detached, becoming free and sinking to the bottom, starting a new colony.

This mode of longitudinal fission is distinct from other modes of longitudinal fission, a process known for a few species Of cnidarians. Further studies of this process may {{shed light on the}} understanding of the evolutionary pathways in Cnidaria and animals.

40|$|Purpose: CrN coating, <b>hard</b> chrome <b>plating</b> and {{nitriding}} {{has been}} applied on commonly used thermoset plastic mould steel X 40 CrMoV 5 - 1 (Materials number 1. 2344). The effects of these surface treatments over wear behaviour, impact behaviour, hardness, tensile strength and corrosion behaviour experimentally investigated. Design/methodology/approach: Charpy test, tensile test, hardness measurements, wear tests, salt spray tests conducted over <b>hard</b> chrome <b>plated,</b> nitrided, CrN coated and uncoated X 40 CrMoV 5 - 1 specimens. Coating thickness and diffusion layers examined by Nikon Eclipse LV 150 optical microscope. Findings: Highest micro hardness was observed in CrN coating, which is followed by nitriding and <b>hard</b> chrome <b>plating.</b> In wear tests, highest wear resistance was observed in CrN coating, then nitriding. <b>Hard</b> chrome <b>plated</b> samples were exposed abrasion more than uncoated ones. CrN coating and <b>hard</b> chrome <b>plating</b> didn’t affect the yield and tensile strength of material but increased the modulus of elasticity. It is observed that, nitriding decreased the tensile strength but increased the modulus of elasticity.

In the course of their research, THETA Technologies, Inc. identified that current state-of-the-art in ballistic protection and overall composite reinforcement is a high density extended chain polyethylene (HDECPE) fiber known as SPECTRA{reg_sign}, a product of AlliedSignal Fibers, Petersburg, VA. SPECTRA{reg_sign} is ten times stronger than steel of equal weight. As a non-aramid polyethylene, it offers highly desirable properties in areas of resistance to chemical degradation, virtual neutral buoyancy (0. 97), and increased capacity for composite bonding over competing nylon-based fibers, such as KEVLAR{reg_sign}.
