5|$|In late 1978, Guccione {{shut down}} the {{unprofitable}} magazine. Wintour decided {{to take some time}} off from work. She broke up with Bradshaw and began a relationship with French record producer Michel Esteban, for two years dividing her time with him between Paris and New York. She returned to work in 1980, succeeding Elsa Klensch as <b>fashion</b> <b>editor</b> for a new women's magazine named Savvy. It sought to appeal to career-conscious professional women, who spent their own money, the readers Wintour would later target at Vogue.|$|E

5|$|The Lady's Realm was a British women's {{magazine}} published from 1896 until 1914, possibly until 1915. It primarily targeted upper-class readers {{as well as}} an aspirational middle-class audience, featuring photographs, poems, fiction, {{and columns}} by popular authors such as Marie Corelli, Frances Hodgson Burnett, Jack London, and H.G. Wells. The London Season was regularly covered, with visuals of significant society figures and débutantes appearing. Fashion trends in Paris and London were frequently discussed as well, particularly by its <b>fashion</b> <b>editor</b> Marian Pritchard.|$|E
5|$|Lady's Realm printed an {{assortment}} of Court and society news alongside articles on more daily tasks such as food, homemaking, and methods for female readers to earn money. It covered the London Season, displaying photographs of significant society figures and débutantes. It claimed to feature over 500 illustrations in each volume. Theatre was another regular topic of the magazine's, as was fiction, poetry, and reports on fashion. The Lady's Realms <b>fashion</b> <b>editor</b> Marian Pritchard regularly wrote articles on emerging fashions in London and Paris, and recommended locations where readers could buy them. While still featuring fashion and beauty, it also encouraged careers for women in music, art, business, and millinery. The magazine maintained this blend of topics relatively consistently, though it gradually made {{minor changes to the}} proportion it focused on different topics, for instance later focusing less on the nobility and more on the lives of clergymen and governors general.|$|E

Impressed by her innovative approach, he soon formed a strong working relationship with her, also working on distinctive advertising shoots for clients including Coca-Cola, Guinness and American Express. Lee followed Wintour to New York City in 1975 and continued to collaborate, producing shoots for Viva (where she was now the <b>fashion</b> <b>editor)</b> for clients such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's.

50|$|Stephen Sprouse's initial Day-Glo bright, sixties-inspired, graffiti-printed fashion {{collections}} for men {{and women}} caught the attention of <b>fashion</b> <b>editors,</b> store buyers, and fashionistas, garnering much media coverage. His initial collections (1983-1985) were huge critical hits, sold at only the best stores (his 1983 collections were sold exclusively at Bergdorf Goodman and Henri Bendel in New York City on a small scale). To much surprise in the fashion and retail communities, Sprouse declared bankruptcy in June 1985 (even though his base of influential <b>fashion</b> <b>editors</b> and high-end stores were firmly in place). Sprouse cited production, late deliveries, and financial problems in an interview with Women's Wear Daily shortly after he closed his initial business.|$|R

25|$|Leaving {{behind his}} old {{communist}} comrades, Rushmore also {{separated from his}} leftist wife and daughter. During 1944–45, Rushmore met a new staff writer on the Journal-American—Marjorie Frances McCoy née Everitt, a widow with two young daughters, Jean and Lynn. A strawberry-blonde, beauty contest winner from Charlotte, North Carolina, she would succeed as a Powers model-cover girl and later as an editor at Woman's Day. After {{the death of her}} first husband, she returned to New York City, where at the Journal she would become the <b>fashion</b> <b>editor.</b> In the years to come, her prominence would overshadow Rushmore's shrinking repute, her success a cause of envy that would result in unending domestic friction. But in 1945, Rushmore was still {{at the peak of his}} career. Later that year, after obtaining a Mexican divorce from Ruth Rushmore, he married McCoy in a Bridgeport, Connecticut ceremony. Ruth Rushmore tried to have Howard arrested—her lawyer would later maintain that the Mexican divorce was invalid and that Howard Rushmore was a bigamist.|$|E

50|$|Wardrobe stylists can be paid {{an hourly}} wage {{or by the}} day, called a day rate. Editorial {{assignments}} tend to pay less money, while advertising campaigns, commercials, or spokesperson campaigns tend to pay the most. Some freelance <b>fashion</b> <b>editors,</b> that is, stylists who work exclusively in producing editorial content, may receive a rate per page in a given publication; <b>fashion</b> <b>editors</b> typically negotiate this rate on a yearly basis, during which time the publication will assign {{a certain number of}} project pages to be completed. Stylists may also be paid a flat fee for the length of a project, usually called a buy out. Some stylists can be put on a monthly retainer, in which they are paid a set fee {{for a period of time}} and are on call for the entire time period.|$|R
50|$|After {{ten years}} {{working at a}} private {{architectural}} firm, Siboni decided to launch his own concept restaurant bar, Zinc Bar, in the fashionable 11th arrondissement district of Paris.

500|$|In her new home, {{she became}} a junior <b>fashion</b> <b>editor</b> at Harper's Bazaar in New York City in 1975. Wintour's {{innovative}} shoots led editor Tony Mazzola to fire her after nine months. She was reportedly introduced to Bob Marley by one of Bradshaw's friends, and disappeared {{with him for a}} week; [...] in a 2017 appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden, she said she had never actually met the reggae legend, but certainly would have [...] "hooked up" [...] with him if she had. A few months later, Bradshaw helped her get her first position as a <b>fashion</b> <b>editor,</b> at Viva, a women's adult magazine started by Kathy Keeton, then wife of Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione. She has rarely discussed working there, due to that connection. This was the first job at which she was able to hire a personal assistant, which began her reputation as a demanding and difficult boss.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, {{she became}} <b>fashion</b> <b>editor</b> of New York. There, the fashion spreads and photo shoots {{she had been}} putting together for years finally began attracting attention. Editor Edward Kosner sometimes bent very strict rules for her and let her work on other sections of the magazine. She learned through her work on a cover involving Rachel Ward how effectively celebrity covers sold copies. [...] "Anna saw the celebrity thing coming before everyone else did," [...] Grace Coddington said three decades later. A former colleague arranged {{for an interview with}} Vogue editor Grace Mirabella that ended when Wintour told Mirabella she wanted her job.|$|E
500|$|Astaire also chose and {{provided}} his own clothes. He is widely credited with influencing 20th century male fashion and, according to Forbes male <b>fashion</b> <b>editor,</b> G. Bruce Boyer, the [...] "Isn't It a Lovely Day?" [...] routine: [...] "shows Astaire {{dressed in the}} style he would make famous: soft-shouldered tweed sports jacket, button-down shirt, bold striped tie, easy-cut gray flannels, silk paisley pocket square, and suede shoes. It's an extraordinarily contemporary approach to nonchalant elegance, a look Ralph Lauren {{and a dozen other}} designers still rely on more than six decades later. Astaire introduced a new style of dress that broke step with the spats, celluloid collars, and homburgs worn by aristocratic European-molded father-figure heroes." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{movement}} in China {{to have the}} word banned from most government websites, including the All-China Women's Federation website, was marginally successful. The wording was changed to [...] "old unmarried women", but sheng nu remains a widespread and mainstream idea. The term has also been embraced by some feminists {{with the opening of}} 'sheng nu' social clubs. In an interview with <b>fashion</b> <b>editor</b> Sandra Bao by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, Bao stated that [...] "many modern, single women in China enjoy their independence and feel comfortable holding out for the right man, even as they grow older." [...] She further explained, [...] "We don't want to make compromises because of age or social pressure".|$|E
500|$|As a teenager, Sevigny would {{occasionally}} ditch school in Darien {{and catch the}} train into Manhattan. In 1992, at age 17, she was spotted on an East Village street by Andrea Linett, a <b>fashion</b> <b>editor</b> of Sassy magazine, who was so impressed by her style that she asked her to model for the magazine; she was later made an intern. When recounting the event, Sevigny was ambivalent about it, stating that [...] "the woman at Sassy just liked the hat I was wearing". She later modeled in the magazine {{as well as for}} X-girl, the subsidiary fashion label of the Beastie Boys' [...] "X-Large", designed by Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, which then led to an appearance in the music video for Sonic Youth's [...] "Sugar Kane".|$|E
500|$|The film {{also has}} been {{credited}} with increasing interest in R.J. Cutler's documentary The September Issue, which followed Wintour and other Vogue editors as they prepared the issue for that month of 2007. Writing in The Ringer on the tenth anniversary, Alison Herman observed that [...] "The Devil Wears Prada transformed Wintour's image {{from that of a}} mere public figure into that of a cultural icon." [...] Once known primarily as a <b>fashion</b> <b>editor,</b> she was now [...] "every overlord you'd ever bitched about three drinks deep at happy hour, only to dutifully fetch her coffee the next day." [...] Ultimately, the film had effected a positive change in Wintour's image, Herman argued, [...] "from a tyrant in chinchilla to an idol for the post-Sandberg age." ...|$|E
