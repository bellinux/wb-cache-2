40|$|An {{investigation}} on the plasma-induced field emission (PFE) properties {{of a large}} area carbon nanotube (CNT) cathode on a 2  MeV linear induction accelerator injector is presented. Experimental {{results show that the}} cathode is able to emit intense electron beams. Intense electron beams of 14. 9 – 127. 8 [*][*]A/cm^{ 2 } are obtained from the cathode. The CNT cathode desorbs gases from the CNTs during the PFE process. The fast cathode plasma expansion affects the <b>diode</b> <b>perveance.</b> The amount of outgassing is estimated to be 0. 06 – 0. 49 [*][*]Pa·L, and the ratio of outgassing and electron are roughly calculated to be within the range of 170 – 350 atoms per electron. The effect of the outgassing is analyzed, and the outgassing mass spectrum of the CNT cathode has been studied during the PFE. There is a significant desorption of CO_{ 2 }, N_{ 2 }(CO), and H_{ 2 } gases, which plays an important role during the PFE process. All the experiments demonstrate that the outgassing {{plays an important role in}} the formation of the cathode plasma. Moreover, the characteristic turn-on time of the CNT cathode was measured to be 39  ns...|$|E
