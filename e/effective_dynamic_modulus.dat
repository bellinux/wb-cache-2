40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the design of}} composite materials with simultaneously high stiffness and high damping. We consider layered composite materials with parallel plane layers made of a stiff constituent and a lossy polymer. We analyze the response of these composites to a dynamic load with an arbitrary direction. Using the viscoelastic correspondence principle and linear frequency domain viscoelastic models, we derive an expression for the effective complex modulus of layered composites of infinite size at infinitesimal strains. The dependence of the <b>effective</b> <b>dynamic</b> <b>modulus</b> and loss factor on the geometrical parameters and on the tensile and bulk loss factors of the lossy constituent is analyzed. Moreover we determine {{the magnitude of the}} strains in the lossy constituent and demonstrate that the combination of high stiffness and high damping of these composites is due to the high normal and/or shear strains in the lossy material. We use nonlinear constrained optimization to design layered composites with simultaneously high stiffness and high damping while constraining the strains in the polymer. To determine the range of validity of the linear viscoelastic model, simulations using finite deformations models are compared to the theoretical results. Finally, we compute the effective properties of composites of finite size using finite element methods and determine the minimum size required to approach the formulae derived for composites of infinite size...|$|E

40|$|Moisture {{damage is}} one of the major {{problems}} that can be faced by a pavement during the design life. It can tremendously reduce a pavement 2 ̆ 7 s strength and consequently its life. Moisture sensitivity testing of asphalt mixtures is critical for ensuring performance expectations are met. Moisture susceptibility is most commonly tested using the modified Lottman test. The shift towards mechanistic design calls for the utilization of a more fundamental test to evaluate moisture damage. The evolution of unconfined <b>dynamic</b> <b>modulus</b> and creep (flow number) tests as performance tests for inclusion in the Superpave mix design process make these candidate tests for inclusion in moisture sensitivity testing. The challenge in moisture sensitivity testing is the ability to capture the various mechanisms that cause moisture damage. Previous research has recommended the use of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>modulus</b> test for moisture damage evaluation. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>modulus</b> test results can be used to develop master curves that can be used to predict pavement performance at any temperature and/or frequency. An objective of this study was to identify the appropriate test that can identify whether a mix is moisture susceptible or not. Indirect tensile test, <b>dynamic</b> <b>modulus</b> test and flow number test were investigated to satisfy this objective. Another objective was to use finite element modeling to evaluate the moisture susceptibility and variability of a mixture. In the present study, sixteen field procured mixtures were subjected to five different modes of moisture conditioning: 1. unconditioned without water submersion testing, 2. unconditioned with water submersion testing, 3. moisture saturation with water submersion testing, 4. moisture saturation with freeze/thaw conditioning without water submersion testing, and 5. moisture saturation with freeze/thaw conditioning and with water submersion testing. These samples were tested for flow number. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>modulus</b> tests were performed on both moisture conditioned and unconditioned samples. The results were used to develop mastercurves. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>modulus</b> results were used as input to a finite element model in which stochastic variation of the results were incorporated in the model. The model was validated by the results from the flow number test. The methodology was applied on sixteen projects and the results were compared to the results achieved using the AASHTO T 283 methodology and <b>dynamic</b> <b>modulus</b> test results. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>modulus</b> test results show consistency with AASHTO T 283 in identifying moisture sensitivity of a mixture. This dissertation outlines a method for evaluating hot mix asphalt moisture susceptibility utilizing <b>dynamic</b> <b>modulus</b> testing and is compatible with the proposed performance testing for accompanying Superpave volumetric mix design. The results of the proposed mixture <b>dynamic</b> <b>modulus</b> moisture susceptibility method can also be used in the new M-E PDG for evaluating the moisture susceptibility effects of the tested mixtures. This in part allows for the evaluation of this environmental effect in the M-E PDG. The results show that the <b>dynamic</b> <b>modulus</b> test has good potential to identify the moisture susceptibility of the material provided that it is combined with the field and loading conditions. The flow number test also showed good potential when it was analyzed using the Ohio State model. The data showed consistency but a comparison to field performance is needed to identify whether the results are correlated to field performance or not. The finite element analysis showed that the results 2 ̆ 7 variability increase with moisture conditioning and that moisture conditioned samples are more susceptible to rutting.
