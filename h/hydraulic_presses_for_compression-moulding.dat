30|$|Both {{windmill}} and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pressed</b> oils {{have been}} used in the 19 th century.

40|$|The {{author has}} made an {{analysis}} of several technologies stamping forgings compressor blades from titanium alloy ВT 3 - 1. These technologies use different types of forming equipment: crank hot press, high-speed hammers, screw <b>presses</b> with <b>hydraulic</b> drive (SPHD), as well as isothermal forging <b>hydraulic</b> <b>press.</b> He pointed out the main {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the technology, noting that high-speed punching in the shipbuilding industry of Ukraine is not used for the manufacture of forgings blades. The article contains an economic analysis of the cost of forgings blades, which are made on four technologies: punching and calibration to crank hot press, stamping and calibration to <b>press</b> <b>for</b> isothermal forging, stamping and calibration on SPHD-press, stamping on SPHD-press and calibration to <b>press</b> <b>for</b> isothermal forging. The author has identified the effective use of these technologies. He showed that the use of SPHD-presses and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>presses</b> <b>for</b> isothermal forging reduces the cost of forging on the average 12 % in comparison with the technology at the crank hot stamping press, increases the utilization of metal 1, 3 - 1, 5 times more, reduces power consumption 1, 05 - 3, 0 times less and complexity of manufacturing 1, 8 - 4, 2 times. However SPHD-press increases capital investment in the organization of stamping technology 2, 6 - 5, 3 times more and depreciation 2 - 4 times.
