40|$|Networks {{can be used}} to {{describe}} the interconnections among individuals, which {{play an important role in}} the spread of disease. Although the small-world effect has been found to have a significant impact on <b>epidemics</b> <b>in</b> single networks, the small-world effect on <b>epidemics</b> <b>in</b> interconnected networks has rarely been considered. Here, we study the susceptibleinfected-susceptible (SIS) model of <b>epidemic</b> spreading <b>in</b> a system comprising two interconnected small-world networks. We find that the <b>epidemic</b> threshold <b>in</b> such networks decreases when the rewiring probability of the component small-world networks increases. When the infection rate is low, the rewiring probability affects the global steady-state infection density, whereas when the infection rate is high, the infection density is insensitive to the rewiring probability. Moreover, <b>epidemics</b> <b>in</b> interconnected small-world networks are found to spread at different velocities that depend on the rewiring probability.

5|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, formal {{schooling}} had again become {{a feature of}} the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu <b>epidemic</b> <b>in</b> 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.|$|E

Their management style clashed with Theophilus, when he recovered and returned in February. They denied his play The Harlot's Progress instead putting a play by Ellys. The fighting between the managers coincided with poor attendance {{from both the}} <b>epidemic</b> <b>in</b> London and other theatres attracting audiences with popular operatic performances. Theophilus's play The Mock-Officer failed, which caused Highmore and Ellys to turn further against him. However, his 31 March 1733 The Harlot's Progress, based on William Hogarth's painting of the same name, proved to be very successful and embarrassed the two other managers.|$|E

In 2001, in response to problems within the National AIDS Control Programme established by Banda, Muluzi created the National AIDS Commission. Unlike Banda, who prevented the public from accessing information about the epidemic, Muluzi ensured that information about HIV/AIDS was available {{on the radio and}} television, in newspapers, and on billboards. However, despite Muluzi's efforts, HIV prevalence was already significantly influencing national agricultural productivity during this period, and Malawi experienced an AIDS-related nationwide famine in 2002.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to a typhus <b>epidemic</b> <b>in</b> the women's camp, Mengele cleared one block of 600 Jewish women {{and sent them to}} the gas chamber. The building was then cleaned and disinfected, and the occupants of a neighboring block were bathed, de-loused, and given new clothing before being moved into the clean block. The process was repeated until all the barracks were disinfected. Similar disinfections were used for later epidemics of scarlet fever and other diseases, but with all the sick prisoners being sent to the gas chambers. For his efforts, Mengele was awarded the War Merit Cross (Second Class with Swords) and was promoted in 1944 to First Physician of the Birkenau subcamp.|$|E
5|$|The HIV/AIDS <b>epidemic</b> <b>in</b> Malawi {{has been}} {{characterized}} by drastic declines {{in the number of}} health workers available to provide treatment and care and increasing strain on health services: {{more than half of all}} hospital admissions in Malawi are related to HIV/AIDS. However, Malawi currently faces a significant deficit in human resources: only 159 doctors were practicing in Malawi in 2007. The World Health Organization's Essential Health Package recommends placing at least three health workers at every health facility in the country, but the vast majority of Malawi's health facilities fail to meet this standard.|$|E
5|$|The first {{silkworm}} diseases {{began to}} appear in 1845, creating an epidemic. Among them are pébrine, caused by the microsporidia Nosema bombycis, grasserie, caused by a virus, flacherie, caused by eating infected mulberry leaves or white muscardine disease, caused by the fungus Beauveria bassiana. The epidemic grew to a massive scale, and after having attacked the silkworms, other viruses began to infect the mulberry trees. The chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas, French minister of agriculture, was charged with stopping the <b>epidemic.</b> <b>In</b> face of sericulturers' call for help, he asked Louis Pasteur to study the disease, starting in 1865. For many years, Pasteur thought that pébrine was not a contagious disease. In 1870 he changed his view, and measures were enacted that caused the disease to decline.|$|E

He rarely drank, and he became a devout Episcopalian.|$|E
5|$|After {{ten days}} of balloting in Rome, without any {{candidate}} approaching the requisite two-thirds, the cardinals adjourned until June {{and changed the}} location of the election from Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore to Santa Maria sopra Minerva. After a summer <b>epidemic</b> <b>in</b> the city, and the death of Cholet in August, they dispersed until late September. The non-Roman cardinals went to Rieti (except Caetani, who went to his native Anagni) while the Roman cardinals remained in the city. As balloting continued into the next summer, the disorder in Rome increased dramatically (even by the standards of a sede vacante, during which, based on the biblical example of Barabbas, all prisoners were released). The deaths of newly elected Roman Senators Agapitus Colonna and Ursus Orsini around Easter 1293 further exacerbated the anarchy within the city, which had been marked by the destruction of palaces, the slaying of pilgrims, and the sacking of churches. After the summer of 1293, the cardinals dispersed and agreed to reconvene in Perugia on October 18.|$|E
5|$|Although too old {{to serve}} in the military, Blackburn {{supported}} the Confederate cause during the Civil War. In {{the early days of the}} war, he acted as a civilian agent for the governments of Kentucky and Mississippi. By 1863, he was aiding Confederate blockade runners in Canada. In 1864, he traveled to Bermuda to help combat a yellow fever outbreak that threatened Confederate blockade running operations there. Shortly after the war's end, a Confederate double agent accused him of having carried out a plot to start a yellow fever <b>epidemic</b> <b>in</b> the Northern United States that would have hampered the Union war effort. Blackburn was accused of collecting linens and garments used by yellow fever patients and smuggling them into the Northern states to be sold. The evidence against Blackburn was considerable, although much of it was either circumstantial or provided by witnesses of questionable reputation. Although he was acquitted by a Toronto court, public sentiment was decidedly against him throughout much of the United States. Today, historians still disagree as to the strength of the evidence supporting Blackburn's role in the alleged plot. Any plot of this nature was destined to fail, however; in 1900, Walter Reed discovered that yellow fever is spread by mosquitoes, not by contact.|$|E
