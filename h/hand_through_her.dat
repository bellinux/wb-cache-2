6000|$|He and Noel {{left after}} {{the first part of}} the concert, parting from the other two at the door. He slipped his <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> arm; and, {{following}} out those thoughts of his in the concert-hall, asked: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're a-going {{to make a}} lady of her," [...] he said, {{drawing the}} child's shy face against his gaudy waistcoat, and running his coarse <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> pretty curls; [...] "and she shall marry a jockey when she grows up." ...|$|E

I would jess go quietly with your pore father: 'e knows what's best for you, that 'e do.

6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH, rising, and {{adjusting}} her dress, and then looking about the car, while she passes her <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> lover's arm: [...] "Oh, I do HATE to leave it. Farewell, you dear, kind, good, lovely car! May {{you never have}} another accident!" [...] She kisses her hand to the car, upon which they both look back as they slowly leave it.|$|E
5000|$|Blaming the Flash for his defeat, Thawne {{became obsessed}} with [...] "replacing" [...] Barry Allen and began {{traveling}} {{back in time to}} exact his revenge, using his knowledge of history to his advantage. When Barry's wife, Iris West, rejected Thawne's romantic pursuits, the latter apparently killed her by vibrating his <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> skull. Shortly after Barry had found love again, Thawne returned and threatened to kill Allen's new fiancee, Fiona Webb, on their wedding day. Fearful that history was repeating itself, Allen inadvertently killed Thawne by breaking his neck.|$|E

50|$|For {{the latter}} Luzio lies in wait: he soon detects {{him in a}} {{stealthy}} masker, whose path he bars, and as Friedrich tears himself away {{he is about to}} follow him with shouts and drawn rapier, when by direction of Isabella, concealed among the bushes, he himself is stopped and led astray. Isabella comes forth, rejoicing in the thought of having restored Marianne to her faithless mate at this very moment, and in the possession of what she believes to be the stipulated patent of her brother's pardon; she is on the point of renouncing all further revenge when, breaking open the seal by the light of a torch, she is horrified at discovering an aggravation of the order of execution, which chance and bribery of the gaoler had delivered into <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> wish to defer her brother's knowledge of his ransom.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after this}} event Leif Haraldson dies and Gandalf the Mad is chosen as his successor. Gandalf {{repeatedly}} {{tries to get}} rid of Thorgal, because - as he constantly reminds everyone - Thorgal is an outsider and not of Viking blood. In reality, Gandalf feels threatened because Thorgal is Leif's heir. In the meantime, Thorgal's relationship with Aaricia, Gandalf's daughter, develops and strengthens. While her wishes do not have much influence on her father, she is able to save Thorgal from certain death (by her father's <b>hand)</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> determination and ingenuity.|$|E
50|$|Blaze wears {{a bright}} red headband, red leather jacket and red miniskirt in the first game, a red bra and miniskirt in the sequel, and the silver version of it in third game (red in Japan), along with boots and gloves. Her jump kick {{animation}} was censored in the U.S. version SoR2 to not show her underwear, which surprised the Japanese development team. While Blaze always has brown hair in-game, the SoR main screen, portrait and ending scene show her with black hair. She is the only character that kept her idle move (runs her <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> hair) through the series. SoR stage-boss twin pair Onihime and Yasha, or Mona and Lisa in the English version, are palette swaps of Blaze's sprite set in this game (they look distinctively different in SoR3). Backbone Entertainment's rejected pitch for a reboot of Street of Rage featured an updated look of Blaze based on her earlier appearances.|$|E
50|$|In the aftermath, she {{along with}} her sister, Crystal, Black Bolt, Flint, Gorgon and Swain, are guided by Noh-Varr to the former Kree throne-world of Hala where he has stated they may {{discover}} the origins of Terrigen {{and in so doing}} offer a future to their doomed people, however, things are not well for the former Queen as she runs her <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> powerful hair only to pull a large clump out with it, forcing her to announce to her crew that she is dying. It is soon apparent that Medusa's decision to destroy the Terrigen Cloud is the reason that is afflicting Medusa. She did what she had to in order to save the Mutant race, but in doing so she had doomed the future of her people. Because Medusa had pressed the button, that act had the consequence of gradually draining the life energies from her. Akin to dying of a broken heart, Medusa had acted to end a cultural heritage that had lasted millennia and her body has essentially chosen to end with it. Her only hope now is to find the secrets of the Terrigen and bring a new source of it back to their people, so she too can be revitalized.|$|E

2500|$|Gomez {{revealed}} the artwork {{for the single}} on June 19, 2015. On it, she is seen striking a risqué pose, on a bar stool against a bare wall. The singer sports a natural look in the artwork; barefoot and wearing only an oversized, thin white T-shirt as she runs <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> hair. Jonathan Borge of InStyle opined that the cover art was enough to cause excitement on its own. Eric Diep from Complex said Gomez [...] "slays the cover artwork" [...] and felt it implied her upcoming album would substantiate her maturity as an artist. Idolator's Mike Wass opined that the artwork was a good look for Gomez which manifested maturity, and {{said that it was}} [...] "yet another indication that the next phase of her career will come as something of a shock to long-term fans". Laura Beck of Cosmopolitan called the cover art [...] "insanely sexy" [...] and [...] "gorgeous", and added: [...] "All this lady needs to look amazing is a T-shirt and a stool. Impressive". Wass, Corrine Heller of E! and Amanda Bell of MTV News all commended Gomez's sex appeal in the cover art, while other critics complimented the artwork's beauty and simplicity.|$|R
50|$|Before {{going on}} an {{overseas}} journey, a merchant father asks his three daughters {{what they would}} like him to bring back for them. The eldest asks for a shining tiara, the middle asks for a <b>hand</b> mirror <b>through</b> which <b>her</b> face would always appear young, and the youngest (Nastenka) asks her father to bring her a beautiful scarlet flower like one which she saw in her dreams. Her elder sisters laugh at this simple wish.|$|R
5000|$|In the NOTB simulation, The High met {{and told}} two heroes, Johnny Ray-Gun and speedster Hotfoot, of their {{imprisonment}} {{with support from}} Sgt. Stringer, who then revealed to The High {{that the only way}} to be free from the simulation was for the prisoners to be 'killed' or 'die'. In the real world, Dr. Sin planned on escaping from the bunker; he faked his death by bringing one of the Paladins, Aeronaut, (who bore a strong facial resemblance to the villain) in his place to be killed by Lt. Welles. In the simulation, The High brought Hotfoot and Johnny Ray-Gun to the Paladins' headquarters where he subsequently 'killed' and freed the said team after they were tricked by The Eidolon (for his own amusement) into believing that The High was the [...] "Antichrist" [...] who was responsible for the events of Armageddon. After killing the Paladins and leaving only Hotfoot the alive, The High was contacted by Welles, who stated to him that she would end the lives of everyone inside the simulation as per her orders from the American government. Before 'killing' Hotfoot, The High told him to find Welles as fast as he could once he was awake, while he tried to reason with her. Hotfoot immediately searched through the bunker and finally stopped Welles from initializing the 'kill button' by vibro-phasing his <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> head, inducing brain damage. After this The High then proceeded to destroy the simulation and everyone in it by speeding down into the city from the sky, causing a nuclear explosion.|$|E
40|$|Madame de Staël's {{insistence on}} talking {{politics}} in her daily {{life as well}} as in her writing was partly what caused her banishment by Napoleon, and she continued unreformed on return from exile. From living political life at second <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>her</b> father Jacques Necker and her lover Louis de Narbonne both before and during the Revolution, she moved on to promoting its claims in her salon. Yet although she insisted to the Duke of Wellington that she needed politics in order to live, her attitude towards the propriety of female political engagement varied: at times she declare that women should simply be the guardians of domestic space for the opposite sex, at others that denying women access to the public sphere of activism and engagement was an abuse of human rights. This paradox partly explains the persona of the "homme-femme" she presented in society, and it remained unresolved throughout her life. For all the (disappointed) feminist intimations of the Revolution, however, her imaginitve writing, like the Revolution itself, consistently shows woman's attempts at public self-assertion as doomed.

60|$|He shook <b>hands</b> with <b>her.</b> <b>Through</b> the {{curtains}} {{he watched her}} jump into a four-wheeler that stood at the door. It rolled away. Then he threw himself on his bed and hid {{his face in his}} hands. He felt tears coming to his eyes, and he was angry with himself; he clenched his hands and screwed up his body to prevent them; but he could not; and great painful sobs were forced from him.|$|R
6000|$|These {{children}} of the city, {{where there is no}} place for love-making, for discovering and testing each other's hidden beings, ran off together in the scanted parties of the ambitious poor. Walter was extravagant financially as he was mentally, but he had many debts, some conscience, and a smallness of salary. She was pleased by the smallest diversions, however, and found luxury in a bowl of chop-suey. He took her to an Italian restaurant and pointed out supposititious artists. They had gallery seats for a Maude Adams play, at which she cried and laughed whole-heartedly and held his <b>hand</b> all <b>through.</b> <b>Her</b> first real tea was with him--in Panama one spoke of [...] "ladies' afternoon tea," [...] not of [...] "tea." [...] She was awed by his new walking-stick and the new knowledge of cinnamon toast which he displayed for her. She admired, too, the bored way he swung his stick as they sauntered {{into and out of the}} lobbies of the great hotels.|$|R
50|$|Cut {{to present}} day: {{a girl named}} Maddie goes to a party held by Angela Feld with her friends Lily and Suzanne. She realizes her ex-boyfriend Colin is there, dealing drugs. Also there is Lily's ex-boyfriend Dex and his friend Jason. At the party, Angela prompts {{everyone}} to go wild, as she must make money off the party or {{she will have to}} live on the streets. Lily and Dex eventually reunite, while Suzanne becomes incredibly drunk. Maddie goes to the toilet, only to have a <b>hand</b> grab <b>her</b> <b>through</b> the mirror. They pass it off as an elaborate trick placed by Angela.|$|R
50|$|The video {{starts with}} Emily Haines walking into {{her living room}} and {{inserting}} Metric's Live It Out record into her record player. As soon as the song starts, the screen turns {{black and white and}} <b>hands</b> pull Emily <b>through</b> <b>her</b> carpet. During the first verse, the video interlopes with Emily singing {{on the floor in the}} living room and on a bed. When the first chorus begins, we see Jimmy Shaw playing the guitar covered in blood, while Emily sings. <b>Hands</b> are reaching <b>through</b> the roof and walls, trying to grab her (a reference to the 1965 Roman Polanski film Repulsion). During the second verse, Emily is walking down a hallway, looking around in fear as she continues to sing. We go back to Jimmy Shaw during the second chorus. During the bridge and final chorus, blood begins to leak from a lightbulb, a power socket, a television set, and other appliances (probably a reference to Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead). When the song ends, the screen becomes coloured again, and Emily sighs in relief, apparently just dreaming.|$|R

[...] This he did, and afterward shook <b>hands</b> with <b>her</b> <b>through</b> the carriage window. This was all he saw of her, and the words which have been repeated were all that were spoken. Of her face he had not caught a glimpse.|$|R
50|$|Mark {{enters a}} room and finds a group of Nazi playing cards around a table. They invite the inebriated youth to join them. The others {{disappear}} and Mark plays Russian roulette with Willy by playing a five-hand of cards with him, being forced to put the revolver to his head and pull the trigger three times with a single bullet in it. Mark survives the game and gets his reward: an assignation with a prostitute in a neighboring room. His desire turns to horror when his <b>hands</b> go right <b>through</b> <b>her</b> body and into a bloody pulp. Running out of the room, Mark sees Paul on the stairs and sees him transform into a Nazi too. Mark lunges at Paul in which Mark falls {{down the stairs and}} breaks his neck. The others drag him into the living room where he dies right before their eyes.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Bowen came in. From {{the fact}} that there was no {{greeting}} between her and Mr. Morton, Colville inferred that she was returning to the room after having already been there. She stood a moment, with a little uncertainty, when she had shaken hands with him, and then dropped upon the sofa beyond Effie. The little girl ran one <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> Colville's arm, and the other <b>through</b> <b>her</b> mother's, and gripped them fast. [...] "Now I have got you both," [...] she triumphed, and smiled first into her face, and then into his.|$|R

"It was seldom, indeed," [...] remarked Colonel Starbottle, {{placing his}} fat {{fingers in the}} frill of his shirt front, [...] "that a {{movement}} like this was graced with the actual presence of a lofty, inspiring, yet delicate spirit--a Boadicea--indeed, he might say a Joan of Arc--in the person of their charming hostess, Mrs. Brant. Not only were they favored by her social and hospitable ministration, but by her active and enthusiastic cooperation in the glorious work they had in <b>hand.</b> It was <b>through</b> <b>her</b> correspondence and earnest advocacy {{that they were to}} be favored to-night with the aid and counsel {{of one of the most}} distinguished and powerful men in the Southern district of California, Judge Beeswinger, of Los Angeles. He had not the honor of that gentleman's personal acquaintance; he believed he was not far wrong in saying that this was also the misfortune of every gentleman present; but the name itself was a tower of strength. He would go further, and say that Mrs. Brant herself was personally unacquainted with him, but it was through the fervor, poetry, grace, and genius of her correspondence with that gentleman that they were to have the honor of his presence that very evening. It was understood that advices had been received of his departure, and that he might be expected at Robles at any moment." ...|$|R
