25|$|The {{program has}} been immensely popular. President García {{expanded}} the program, which has been praised by neoliberal reformers for extending coverage to indigenous people and women.

25|$|It is {{possible}} that shorter durations of therapy (e.g., six months) may be sufficient to treat TB meningitis, but no clinical trial <b>has</b> <b>addressed</b> this issue. The CSF of patients with treated TB meningitis is commonly abnormal even at 12 months; the rate of resolution of the abnormality bears no correlation with clinical progress or outcome, and is not an indication for extending or repeating treatment; repeated sampling of CSF by lumbar puncture to monitor treatment progress should therefore not be done.|$|E
25|$|These {{results suggest}} that the four MBTI scales can be {{incorporated}} within the Big Five personality trait constructs, but that the MBTI lacks a measure for emotional stability dimension of the Big Five (though the TDI, discussed above, <b>has</b> <b>addressed</b> that dimension). Emotional stability (or neuroticism) is a predictor of depression and anxiety disorders. These correlations refer to the second letter shown, i.e., the table shows that I and P have negative correlations with extraversion and conscientiousness, respectively, while F and N have positive correlations with agreeableness and openness, respectively.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, {{international}} organizations began {{to admit that}} structural adjustment policies were worsening life for the world's poor. The World Bank changed structural adjustment loans, allowing for social spending to be maintained, and encouraging a slower change to policies such as transfer of subsidies and price rises. In 1999, the World Bank and the IMF introduced the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach to replace structural adjustment loans. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach has been interpreted {{as an extension of}} structural adjustment policies as it continues to reinforce and legitimize global inequities. Neither approach <b>has</b> <b>addressed</b> the inherent flaws within the global economy that contribute to economic and social inequities within developing countries.|$|E
25|$|Stanley Fish has {{expressed}} strong {{reservations about the}} attempt to apply the concept of negative capability to social contexts. He has written in critique of Unger's early work as being unable to chart a route for the idea to pass into reality, which leaves history closed and the individual holding onto the concept while kicking against air. Fish finds the capability Unger invokes in his early works unimaginable and unmanufacturable {{that can only be}} expressed outright in blatant speech, or obliquely in concept. More generally, Fish finds the idea of radical culture as an oppositional ideal in which context is continuously refined or rejected impracticable at best, and impossible at worst. Unger <b>has</b> <b>addressed</b> these criticisms by developing a full theory of historical process in which negative capability is employed.|$|E
