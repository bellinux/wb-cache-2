5|$|In {{the summer}} of 303, {{following}} a series of rebellions in Melitene (Malatya, Turkey) and Syria, a second edict was published, ordering the arrest and imprisonment of all bishops and priests. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>judgment</b> of historian Roger Rees, there was no logical necessity for this second edict; that Diocletian issued one indicates that he was either unaware the first edict was being carried out, or that {{he felt it was}} not working as quickly as he needed it to. Following the publication of the second edict, prisons began to fillthe underdeveloped prison system of the time could not handle the deacons, lectors, priests, bishops, and exorcists forced upon it. Eusebius writes that the edict netted so many priests that ordinary criminals were crowded out, and had to be released.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> of grammaticality of Japanese and English bitransitive {{sentences}} with a differing {{number of}} arguments.

Findings showed no effect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>judgments</b> of Japanese sentences.

25|$|In Lawrence v. Texas (2003), the Court {{struck down}} a Texas statute prohibiting {{homosexual}} sodomy on substantive due process grounds. In Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's opinion concurring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>judgment,</b> however, she argued that by prohibiting only homosexual sodomy, and not heterosexual sodomy as well, Texas's statute did not meet rational-basis review under the Equal Protection Clause; her opinion prominently cited City of Cleburne, and also relied in part on Romer. Notably, O'Connor's opinion did not claim to apply {{a higher level of}} scrutiny than mere rational basis, and the Court has not extended suspect-class status to sexual orientation.|$|E
25|$|Justice White concurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>judgment.</b> He {{believed}} {{that in this}} case, the search and seizure {{was consistent with the}} Fourth Amendment.

He stated that the exclusion of the evidence would have set the criminals free and it would not have served “any constitutional interest in securing compliance with the important requirements of the Fourth Amendment.” Justice White does not believe that the exclusionary rule should be used in any case where law enforcement officials reasonably believe their actions are consistent with the Fourth Amendment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{present study}} used event-related brain {{potentials}} to investigate semantic, phonological and syntactic processes in adult German dyslexic and normal readers {{in a word}} reading task. Pairs of German words were presented one word at a time. Subjects had to perform a semantic judgment task (house – window; are they semantically related?), a rhyme judgment task (house – mouse; do they rhyme?) and a gender judgment task (das – Haus [the – house]; is the gender correct? [in German, house has a neutral gender: das Haus]). Results Normal readers responded faster compared to dyslexic readers in all three tasks. Onset latencies of the N 400 component were delayed in dyslexic readers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rhyme <b>judgment</b> and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gender <b>judgment</b> task, but not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> semantic <b>judgment</b> task. N 400 and the anterior negativity peak amplitudes did not differ between the two groups. However, the N 400 persisted longer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dyslexic group <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rhyme <b>judgment</b> and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> semantic <b>judgment</b> tasks. Conclusion These findings indicate that dyslexics are phonologically impaired (delayed N 400 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rhyme <b>judgment</b> task) but that they also have difficulties in other, non-phonological aspects of reading (longer response times, longer persistence of the N 400). Specifically, semantic and syntactic integration seem to require more effort for dyslexic readers and take longer irrespective of the reading task {{that has to be}} performed. </p...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to limiting {{the size of}} donations to individual candidates and parties, the Federal Election Campaign Act also includes aggregate caps on the total amount that an individual may give to all candidates and parties. In 2012, Shaun McCutcheon, a Republican Party activist, sought to donate more than was allowed by the federal aggregate limit on federal candidates. McCutcheon et al filed suit against the Federal Election Commission (FEC). In 2014, the US Supreme Court reversed a ruling of the DC District Court's dismissal of McCutcheon v. FEC and struck down the aggregate limits. The plurality opinion invalidated only the aggregate contribution limits, not limits on giving to any one candidate or party. The decisive fifth vote for McCutcheon came from Justice Thomas, who concurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>judgment</b> {{on the grounds that}} all contribution limits are unconstitutional.|$|E
25|$|The writ of coram nobis {{does not}} lie to correct any error <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>judgment</b> of the court nor to {{contradict}} or put in issue any fact directly passed upon and affirmed by the judgment itself. If this could be, {{there would be no}} end of litigation. The writ of coram nobis is not intended to authorize any court to review and revise its opinions; but only to enable it to recall some adjudication made while some fact existed which, if before the court, would have prevented the rendition of the judgment; and which without fault or negligence of the party, was not presented to the court. It is not a writ whereby convicts may attack or relitigate just any judgment on a criminal charge merely because the unfortunate person may become displeased with his confinement or with any other result of the judgment under attack.|$|E
25|$|On 13 May 2009, several record {{companies}} again sued Neij, Svartholm, Sunde and also The Pirate Bay's main {{internet service provider}} Black Internet. They required enforcement for ending The Pirate Bay's accessory to copyright infringement that had not stopped despite the court order in April, and in the complaint listed several pages of works being shared {{with the help of}} the site. The suit was joined by several major film companies on 30 July. The Stockholm district court ruled on 21 August that Black Internet must stop making available the specific works mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>judgment,</b> or face a 500,000 SEK fine. The company was notified of the order on 24 August, and they complied with it on the same day by disconnecting The Pirate Bay. Computer Sweden noted that the judgment did not order The Pirate Bay to be disconnected, but the ISP had no other option for stopping the activity on the site. It was the first time in Sweden for an ISP to be forced to stop providing access for a website. A public support fund fronted by the CEO of the ISP was set up to cover the legal fees of an appeal. Pirate Party leader Rickard Falkvinge submitted the case for Parliamentary Ombudsman review, criticising the court's order to make intermediaries responsible for relayed content and to assign active crime prevention tasks to a private party.|$|E

25|$|After an interval, Servetus {{returned}} to Paris to study medicine in 1536. In Paris, his teachers included Sylvius, Fernel and Johann Winter von Andernach, who hailed him with Andrea Vesalius as his most able assistant in dissections. During these years {{he wrote his}} Manuscript of the Complutense, an unpublished compendium of his medical ideas. Servetus taught mathematics and astrology while he studied medicine. He predicted an occultation of Mars by the Moon, and this joined to his teaching generated much envy among the medicine teachers. His teaching classes were suspended by the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, Jean Tagault, and Servetus wrote his Apologetic Discourse of Michel de Villeneuve in Favour of Astrology and against a Certain Physician against him. Tagault later argued {{for the death penalty}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>judgment</b> of the University of Paris against Servetus. He was accused of teaching De Divinatione by Cicero. Finally, the sentence was reduced to the withdrawal of this edition. As a result of the risks and difficulties of studying medicine at Paris, Servetus decided to go to Montpellier to finish his medical studies, maybe thanks to his teacher Sylvius who did exactly the same as a student. There he became a Doctor of Medicine in 1539. After that he lived at Charlieu. A jealous physician ambushed and tried to kill Servetus, but Servetus defended himself and injured one of the attackers in a sword fight. He was in prison for several days because of this incident.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{character}} of Tibullus the historical man is unclear, {{the character}} of his poetic persona is reflected in his works. He was an amiable man of generous impulses and unselfish disposition, loyal to his friends to the verge of self-sacrifice (as is shown by his leaving Delia to accompany Messalla to Asia), and apparently constant to his mistresses. His tenderness towards them is enhanced by a refinement and delicacy which are rare among the ancients. When treated cruelly by his love, he does not invoke curses upon her head. Instead he goes to her little sister’s grave, hung so often with his garlands and wet with his tears, to bemoan his fate. His ideal is a quiet retirement {{in the country with}} the loved one at his side. He has no ambition and not even a poet's yearning for immortality. In an age of crude materialism and gross superstition, he was religious in the old Roman way. His clear, finished and yet unaffected style made him a great favourite and placed him, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>judgment</b> of Quintilian, ahead of other elegiac writers. For natural grace and tenderness, for exquisiteness of feeling and expression, he stands alone. He rarely overloads his lines with Alexandrian learning. However, his range is limited. Tibullus is smoother and more musical, but liable to become monotonous; Propertius, with occasional harshnesses, is more vigorous and varied. In many of Tibullus's poems a symmetrical composition can be traced.|$|E
