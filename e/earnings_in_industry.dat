30|$|This {{survey is}} unique in {{measuring}} undeclared work, and in particular envelope wages, on an EU wide basis and in a cross‐nationally comparable way, even if the limitations of measuring sensitive issues like undeclared work through a direct survey should be acknowledged. Getting cross‐country data {{on the size of}} the spike at the minimum wage level is also challenging. Until the end of 2008, Eurostat has asked member countries to report the proportion of full‐time employees with earnings on the minimum wage and this measure will be used to measure the size of the spike at the minimum wage level. Also these data on the spike are unique, even if it should be noticed how they were not fully harmonized between the countries (Eurostat, personal communication). Given that the survey on undeclared work took place in May‐June 2007 and that the question on underreporting of earnings referred to the last 12 months, I will use spike data for 2006. I will also use Eurostat data on the minimum monthly wage as a proportion of average monthly <b>earnings</b> <b>in</b> <b>industry</b> and services and I will refer to this measure as the Kaitz index.|$|E

The business environments <b>in</b> those <b>industries</b> {{are not the}} same as those <b>in</b> manufacturing <b>industry,</b> since a part of transportation business in influenced by the industrial regulation. Moreover, the transportation industries have a characteristic of the network industry. This paper especially focuses on the issue whether the value relevance of <b>earnings</b> <b>in</b> transportation <b>industries</b> is different from those <b>in</b> the manufacturing <b>industry.</b> First, by adopting various regression models and by examining across industries and among periods, we find some distinctive results <b>in</b> the transportation <b>industries.</b> <b>In</b> the railroad <b>industry,</b> <b>earnings</b> is valued as if investors expect that earnings will be smoothed by the rate-regulation. On the other hand, although earnings is not so highly relevant <b>in</b> the shipping <b>industry,</b> <b>earnings</b> is value relevant in recent period. Second, the value relevance of <b>earnings</b> <b>in</b> transportation <b>industries</b> does not depend on the relative performance compared with that of the manufacturing industry. We cannot detect the evidence that the performance of transportation <b>industries</b> is evaluated <b>in</b> comparison with the manufacturing <b>industry.</b> Third, <b>in</b> railroad and transportation-by-land industries, the value relevance of <b>earnings</b> differs <b>in</b> the size of network, which is measured by sales volume. In some industry-periods, while earnings for the larger firms is value relevant, earnings for the smaller firms is not relevant.

First, the industrial and regulation policy affect the relevance of <b>earnings</b> <b>in</b> energy <b>industry.</b> However, the recent progress of deregulation and liberalization do not diminish the value relevance of earnings. Second, while the quality of earnings is influenced by the exchange rate and the price of imported crude oil, its influence varies by industries and by periods. However, we cannot find the evidence that the cost adjustment system in public utilities improves the quality of earnings. Third, the quality of earnings is lower for the firms whose profitability is poorer than the average in manufacturing firms. This result implies that the value relevance of rate regulated <b>industries</b> is evaluated <b>in</b> the market, by the comparison of the profitability between industrial firms. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{depart from the}} {{assumption}} on the transferability of accumulated human capital that divides human capital dichotomously into employer-specific and general labour market skills, and pursue the idea of possible industry or occupational specificity. The estimates of a Mincer wage equation, on a BHPS sample, suggest some interesting patterns. Occupation specific skills are estimated to have a rather important contribution in determining wages, highlighting the significance of ‘specialisation ’ in earnings profiles. The evidence, on the other hand, on industry specificity is not so strong {{and in some cases}} inconclusive. In addition, a further examination on occupational and industry specificity indicates that the observed patterns are actually driven by some particular occupations and industries, rejecting the hypothesis of homogeneity across them.

40|$|The value {{relevance}} of earnings is generally affected by macro-economic environments and micro-economic competitive conditions. Therefore, the relevance differs by industries and by periods. In {{order to examine}} the variation in the relevance directly, simply and clearly, {{it is necessary to}} estimate the {{relevance of}} <b>earnings</b> <b>in</b> each <b>industry</b> and each period. In that way, this paper investigate the value relevance of earnings levels after the preparatory study on the relevance of the changes <b>in</b> <b>earnings.</b> We also try to find the regularity in the variation through analyzing the estimated relevance by non-parametric and semi-parametric methods. The four major findings in this research are as follows. First, the changes <b>in</b> <b>earnings</b> are consistently value-relevant over the sample periods (through March 1979 to March 2000) across almost all industries. We cannot find the evidence that the bubble economy nor the following recession diminishes the relevance of earnings. Second, there is an asymmetric relation between the relevance of increase and decrease <b>in</b> <b>earnings.</b> However, the latter is not always transitory and less value-relevant than the former. Contrarily, the decreases <b>in</b> <b>earnings</b> seem to be more persistent and persuasive during the recent depression in Japan. Third, while the relevance of ordinary income levels is consistently related to the relevance of changes in ordinary income, we cannot find the systematic relation between the relevance of levels and changes as to operating profits and net income. As for operating profits and net income, it seems that the unknown different factors affect on the relevance of levels and changes respectively. Fourth, the results cannot support the S-shaped relation hypothesis that the relevance of earnings experiencing more large surprises is relatively lower, which is often detected in prior studies. We find the J-shaped relation that earnings experiencing large positive shocks is more value-relevant in the quiet period (through March 1979 to March 1985). ...|$|R

However, {{it has been suggested}} that future benefits associated with SDC are highly uncertain (Software Publishers Association).

Hence, it is not clear how managers' choice between capitalization and expensing will affect earnings quality.

40|$|This paper uses data on {{individual}} <b>earnings</b> <b>in</b> manufacturing <b>industry</b> for five African {{countries in the}} early 1990 s to test whether firms located {{in the capital city}} pay higher earnings than do firms located elsewhere, and whether such benefits accrue to all or only certain types of workers. Earnings equations are estimated that take into account worker characteristics (education and tenure) and relevant firm characteristics (notably size and whether owned by a foreigner). Any location effect identified is therefore additional to appropriate control variables. There are two main findings. First, we find evidence of a 'capital city premium' that varies between 12 % and 28 % in the five countries. This location premium does not always exceed plausible consumer price differentials, between the capital and other areas, and therefore does not demonstrate that real (purchasing power) manufacturing wages are higher in the capital city. This suggests that spatial inequality <b>in</b> real <b>earnings</b> is unlikely to be significant for manufacturing employees. Secondly, while we find that skilled workers earn a higher wage premium in the capital city than less skilled workers, this is not because of location effects on earnings per se, but rather because of other firm characteristics of firms located in the capital city such as size and foreign ownership. This suggests that spatial inequality in itself does not directly contribute to skilled/less-skilled wage differentials in manufacturing...|$|R
