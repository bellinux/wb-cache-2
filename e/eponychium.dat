2500|$|Together, the <b>eponychium</b> and the cuticle form a {{protective}} seal. [...] The cuticle is the semi-circular layer of non-living, almost invisible dead skin cells that [...] "ride out on" [...] {{and cover the}} back of the visible nail plate while the <b>eponychium</b> is the fold of skin cells that produces the cuticle. They are continuous, and some references view them as one entity; in this classification, the names <b>eponychium,</b> cuticle, and perionychium are synonymous. It is the cuticle (nonliving part) that is removed during a manicure, but the <b>eponychium</b> (living part) should not be touched due to risk of infection. [...] The <b>eponychium</b> is a small band of living cells (epithelium) that extends from the posterior nail wall onto the base of the nail. [...] The <b>eponychium</b> {{is the end of the}} proximal fold that folds back upon itself to shed an epidermal layer of skin onto the newly formed nail plate. The perionyx is the projecting edge of the <b>eponychium</b> covering the proximal strip of the lunula.|$|E

50|$|A hangnail or agnail is a small, torn {{piece of}} skin, more {{specifically}} <b>eponychium</b> or paronychium, {{next to a}} fingernail or toenail.|$|E
50|$|In hoofed animals, the <b>eponychium</b> is the {{deciduous}} hoof capsule in fetuses and newborn foals, {{and is a}} part of {{the permanent}} hoof in older animals.|$|E
50|$|The lunula is most {{noticeable}} on the thumb; however, not everyone's lunula is visible. In some cases, the <b>eponychium</b> may partially or completely cover the lunula.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the loss}} of a {{fingernail}} or thumbnail, the area under the <b>eponychium</b> (cuticle) can be packed with this type of dressing to act as a stent. This helps prevent the cuticle from fusing to the exposed nail bed; otherwise, such fusion can prevent regrowth of a new nail.|$|E
50|$|In human anatomy, cuticle (sometimes {{confused}} with <b>eponychium)</b> refers to several structures. It {{refers to the}} layers of epidermal cells or keratinocytes that produce the horn protein keratin, and also to the superficial layer of overlapping cells covering the hair shaft (cuticula pili) that locks the hair into its follicle (See also Cuticle (hair)).|$|E
50|$|In human anatomy, the <b>eponychium</b> epi (on, upon) + onychion (little claw), is the {{thickened}} {{layer of}} skin surrounding fingernails and toenails. It {{can also be}} called the medial or proximal nail fold. Its function {{is to protect the}} area between the nail and epidermis from exposure to bacteria. The vascularization pattern {{is similar to that of}} perionychium.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} microcirculation in the human digit, focusing on the vascular patterns of its cutaneous and subcutaneous areas. We injected a functional supranumerary human thumb (Wassel type IV) with a low-viscosity acrylic resin through its digital artery. The tissues around the vessels were then digested in hot alkali and the resulting casts treated for scanning electron microscopy. We concentrated on six different areas: the palmar and dorsal side of the skin, the <b>eponychium,</b> the perionychium, the nail bed and the nail root. On the palmar side, many vascular villi were evident: these capillaries followed the arrangement of the fingerprint lines, whereas on the dorsal side they were scattered irregularly inside the dermal papillae. In the hypodermal layer of the palmar area, vascular supports of sweat glands and many arteriovenous anastomoses were visible, along with glomerular-shaped vessels involved in thermic regulation and tactile function. In the <b>eponychium</b> and perionychium, the vascular villi followed the direction of nail growth. In the face of the <b>eponychium</b> in contact with the nail, a wide-mesh net of capillaries was evident. In the nail bed, the vessels were arranged in many longitudinal trabeculae parallel to the major axis of the digit. In the root of the nail, we found many columnar vessels characterized by multiple angiogenic buttons on their surface...|$|E
40|$|Proximal {{subungual}} onychomycosis (PSO) is a {{fungal infection}} {{on the inner}} layer of the nail plate which starts from the <b>eponychium</b> and nail matrix. (1) Onychomycosis {{can be caused by}} a variety of dermatophytes, yeasts and non-dermatophyte molds (NDMs) including species of Aspergillus, Acremonium, Scopulariopsis, Chaetomium, and Fusarium. (2) Fusarium and Acremonium species require special attention, because of their intrinsically low susceptibility to most common antifungal agents and their ability to disseminate in severely compromised hosts, using the nail as a potential source of infection.

30|$|The well-vascularized nail bed and matrix {{enable the}} use of {{rotation}} flap as a proximal or distal pedicled flap for large defects (even 5 – 6  mm) or bipedicled flap for defects < 3  mm. For more complex injuries, some authors suggest nonvascularized composite tissue grafts, combining sterile and germinal matrix and <b>eponychium,</b> usually performed from the second toe. Only 50 % {{have been described as}} attaining good results, and donor-site sequels are not negligible. Many techniques and variations from the wrap-around flap of Morrison have been reported to allow reconstruction in one setting of combined bone and soft-tissue loss.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{introduced}} at 2013 Annual Meeting of the Korean Orthopaedic Association. The fingernail is damaged and deformed by various causes such as crushing, laceration, avulsion injury, infection, tumor and personal habit. The growth dis-turbance of nail plate {{may be caused}} by systemic diseases or trauma without a direct injury of the fingernail and is usually found in accident. We experienced abnormal growth of nail plate in four patients with previous fractures of metacarpal bone. At about 8 weeks after trauma, a swelling and tenderness on the <b>eponychium</b> and a growth disturbance of affected nail plates occurred. All affected fingernails were treated with the nail extraction. The authors report four cases of growth disturbance of nail plates which obtained the satisfactor...|$|E
40|$|Capillary {{circulation}} is delicately {{regulated by}} microvascular constriction mechanisms, thereby controlling capillary perfusion and transmural pressure. The influence of posture on capillary flow {{has been investigated}} in both diseased and healthy people. However, its influence on capillary pressure has rarely been investigated. We measured capillary pressures in the supine and sitting positions in the hallux of healthy volunteers. The capillaries in the <b>eponychium</b> of the hallux were punctured by using a micropipette connected to a micropressure system (900 A, WPI). Also, peripheral arterial and venous pressures were measured in both positions. The rise in systolic capillary pressure from supine to sitting position (32 mmHg; from 39 to 71 mmHg, respectively) was significantly (P < 0. 001) smaller than the rise in systolic arterial toe pressure (57 mmHg, from 87 to 144 mmHg, respectively) and venous pressure (41 mmHg, from 26 mmHg to 67 mmHg, respectively). This study shows that the postural rise in precapillary arteriolar pressure is not completely transmitted to the capillaries, probably because of activation of peripheral vasoconstriction mechanism...|$|E
40|$|We {{performed}} a morphological {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM) study to describe the fine structure and disposition of collagenous tissue in the human toe. After therapeutic amputation of a human right Leg, we applied the Othani maceration technique to the skin of three toes surgically explanted from the foot. We distinguished eight cutaneous regions and focused on some specialized collagenous structures differing in {{the thickness of the}} skin. The eight areas investigated were: the dorsal skin, the <b>eponychium,</b> the perionychium, the hyponychium, the region under the visible nail, the nail root, the plantar skin and finally the toe tip. Each of these areas is characterized by a distinctive collagenous surface disposition, with some peculiar features mostly related to dermal. papillae. At high magnification, we observed the spatial arrangement of the cottagen fibers constituting the top of the dermal, papillae that represents the attachment site of the proliferative basal layer of the epidermis. We also noted an impressive density of collagen fibers throughout the thickness of the dermal layer, organized in specialized structures and constituting the skeleton of dermal, thermoreceptorial corpuscles or sweat glands. A combination of SEM and Ohtani technique disclosed the three-dimensional architecture of the collagenous matrix of tarsal skin under physiologic conditions, giving {{a detailed description of the}} most reactive tissue during pathologic processes...|$|E
40|$|Introduction To prospectively {{evaluate}} {{quantitative assessment}} of fluorescence optical imaging (FOI) for differentiation of synovitic from non-synovitic joints in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods FOI of the hands was performed in patients with active RA, and a stratified quantitative fluorescence readout (FLRO) of 3 phases (1 - 120 s; 121 - 240 s; 241 - 360 s) was generated for 5 individual joints of the clinical predominant hand (carpal joint, metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints of digits II & III). To dissect {{the effect of the}} overall perfusion of the hand from the perfusion due to synovitis, a fluorescence ratio (FLRA) was additionally calculated, dividing each FLRO by the readout of the <b>eponychium</b> of digit II. The mean FLRO and FLRA were compared between joints with absent vs. present synovitis determined by clinical examination, grayscale, color Doppler ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Results The analysis for 90 individual joints from 18 patients yielded FLRO ranging from 4. 4 to 49. 0 × 103, and FLRAs ranging from 0. 37 to 2. 27. Overall, the analyses based on the FLRA revealed a higher discrimination than the analyses related to the FLRO, demonstrating most significant differences in phases 2 and 3.

40|$|Capillary blood {{pressure}} is an essential parameter {{in the study of}} the (patho-) physiology of microvascular perfusion. Currently, capillary pressure measurements in humans are performed using a servo-nulling micropressure system containing an oil-water interface, which suffers some drawbacks. In addition, the effect of the preparation of the skin and the presence of the tip of the pipette in the capillary during the measurement on microcirculatory perfusion has never been described. Therefore, we assessed the feasibility of capillary pressure measurements using an alternative micropressure system using an air-water interface (900 A, WPI) and examined the effect of the measurement on local microcirculation. In 19 healthy male volunteers the apex of capillaries in the <b>eponychium</b> of the fourth finger was punctured, after skin peeling, by a micropipette connected to a servo-nulling micropressure system. Red blood cell velocity (RBCV) was assessed after peeling during the measurement and at an adjacent area. Mean capillary pressure (in 16 / 19 volunteers) was 20. 5 +/- 3. 7 mm Hg (systolic 26. 2 +/- 5. 6 turn Hg, diastolic 17. 6 +/- 3. 9 mm Hg). RBCV was not significantly different before (0. 52 mm/s) and during the measurement (0. 51 mm/s) and at an adjacent area (0. 51 mm/s). Capillary pressure can be measured well with the alternative setup used without hampering capillary flow, while the pressures obtained are in agreement with the results reported previously by other investigators.

40|$|The nail unit is {{the largest}} and a rather complex skin appendage. It {{is located on the}} dorsal aspect of the tips of fingers and toes and has {{important}} protective and sensory functions. Development begins in utero between weeks 7 and 8 and is fully formed at birth. For its correct development, a great number of signals are necessary. Anatomically, it consists of 4 epithelial components: the matrix that forms the nail plate; the nail bed that firmly attaches the plate to the distal phalanx; the hyponychium that forms a natural barrier at the physiological point of separation of the nail from the bed; and the <b>eponychium</b> that represents the undersurface of the proximal nail fold which is responsible for the formation of the cuticle. The connective tissue components of the matrix and nail bed dermis are located between the corresponding epithelia and the bone of the distal phalanx. Characteristics of the connective tissue include: a morphogenetic potency for the regeneration of their epithelia; the lateral and proximal nail folds form a distally open frame for the growing nail; and the tip of the digit has rich sensible and sensory innervation. The blood supply is provided by the paired volar and dorsal digital arteries. Veins and lymphatic vessels are less well defined. The microscopic anatomy varies from nail subregion to subregion. Several different biopsy techniques are available for the histopathological evaluation of nail alterations...|$|E
30|$|Optical means {{magnification}} and a 6 - 0 or 7 - 0 nonchromic absorbable monofilament {{are necessary}} for nail-bed sutures. The nail is raised by using scissors or a delicate spatula starting under the free edge of the nail. It is carefully detached from the nail bed and, if necessary, the nail {{is removed from the}} nail fold by rotational movements [5]. The nail will be preserved and replaced like a biological dressing. This has different functions: to shape to the nail-bed fragments, to avoid adhesion between the roof and the nail bed, to support a possible associated fracture, like a splint, to decrease postoperative pain, and to improve tactile sensation during the healing period. Before replacing the nail, a few holes should be made to allow blood drainage. The nail should be firmly fixed {{at the end of the}} operation. Good insertion of the nail base into the sack bottom of the proximal nail fold is very important to prevent a dead space that may cause adherence between the nail matrix and <b>eponychium</b> and subsequent ungual dystrophy. To hold the nail into the nail fold, an X suture is preferable, avoiding passage through the nail bed with a U suture [6, 7]. While the new fingernail is growing, the nail used as a splint will be pushed off and substituted in 1 – 3  months. It is desirable not to remove the nail or the substitute so as to prevent the nail bed drying our. Steri-Strips may help keep the nail in situ during fingernail regrowth.|$|E
40|$|Importance: Many {{patients}} {{present with}} cutaneous {{signs and symptoms}} that suggest a diagnosis on the autoimmune disease spectrum. During the "acute phase" of disease activity, patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and dermatomyositis (DM) have characteristic nailfold findings, including dilated capillaries, microhemorrhages, and hemosiderin deposits. Objective: To review {{the literature on the}} presentation of microhemorrhages and to highlight the differences (in terms of terminology, characterization, and clinical relevance) between proximal microhemorrhage events and the distal products, often thought of as “hemosiderin deposits” located in the cuticle (<b>eponychium).</b> Because we found no studies directly showing these cuticular products are in fact “hemosiderin-containing,” we conducted a direct staining experiment in vivo using Prussian blue in order to increase our confidence that these products are indeed hemosiderin-containing and that the terminology is accurate for further use. Evidence Review: In July-December 2014, the MeSH function in PubMed was used to identify approximately 165 articles relating to capillaroscopy. We reviewed these articles for mention of microhemorrhages and hemosiderin deposits. In addition, we used PubMed and Google Scholar searches for “hemosiderin + nail”, “Prussian Blue + nail”, and “hemosiderin deposit. ” We found no papers reporting the use of Prussian Blue directly on nailfolds of patients with SSc and DM in vivo. Findings: In our literature review, “microhemorrhages” and “hemosiderin deposits” were often used synonymously, yet they are clearly distinct entities. We present a case in which the presence of these deposits supported a diagnosis of amyopathic DM. We used Prussian blue staining solution to visualize the cuticular (eponychial) hemosoderin-containing deposits (CEHD) – distal cuticular products that reflect previous proximal nailfold microhemorrhage events. CEHD can serve as an indicator of active autoimmune disease, particularly in SSc and DM. Conclusions and Relevance: CEHD are in fact hemosiderin-containing deposits that can reflect the active inflammatory phase of microvascular injury occuring in autoimmune disorders such as DM and SSc. CEHD can be visualized and documented at the bedside with tools commonly available to any dermatologist (portable dermatoscope and compact digital camera) ...|$|E
