In Canada, different variants contain five and 50 micrograms of thimerosal per dose. The use of thiomersal has been controversial, with claims that it can cause autism and other developmental disorders. The U.S. Institute of Medicine examined these claims and concluded in 2004 that the evidence <b>did</b> <b>not</b> support any link between vaccines and autism. Other reviews came to similar conclusions, with a 2006 review in the Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences stating {{that there is no}} convincing evidence to support the claim that thimerosal has a causal role in autism, and a 2009 review in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases stating that claims that mercury can cause autism are [...] "biologically implausible".

40|$|The use of {{raw meat}} diets for pets {{continues}} to increase in popularity. Owners may choose to feed either homemade or commercially available raw meat-based diets. Raw meat-based diets often are fed because they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> <b>preservatives,</b> are highly digestible, and may improve stool quality or skin/coat quality, with many of these claims being substantiated by peer-reviewed research reports. Despite their potential benefits, raw diets also pose many potential risks. Raw meat-based diets {{have been shown to}} increase pathogen exposure, contain nutritional imbalances if not carefully formulated and monitored, and may be inconvenient for the pet owner to store or feed. Despite the proposed advantages and risks of feeding raw diets, little research has been performed to test their nutritional adequacy and safety. Due to the growing trend of pet owners choosing to feed raw meat-based diets, research on the nutrient composition and palatability of such diets, and testing their effects on stool characteristics, nutrient digestibility, fecal fermentative end-product concentrations, and fecal microbial populations is needed. The objective of this research was {{to determine the effects of}} inulin or yeast cell wall extract (YCW) on macronutrient digestibility, blood cell and metabolite concentrations, and fecal fermentative end-product concentrations in healthy adult dogs fed raw diets. Six adult female beagles (5. 5 ?? 0. 5 yr; 8. 5 ?? 0. 5 kg) were randomly allotted to the following diets using a 3 x 2 factorial in a Latin square design: 1) Beef control; 2) Beef + 1. 4 % inulin dry matter basis (DMB; Orafti HP, BENEO Group, Tienan, Belgium); 3) Beef + 1. 4 % YCW (DMB; Bio-Mos, Alltech Biotechnology, Nicholasville, KY); 4) Chicken control; 5) Chicken + 1. 4 % inulin (DMB); 6) Chicken + 1. 4 % YCW (DMB). All dogs maintained desirable stool quality characteristics, produced low stool volume, and diets were highly digestible (protein digestibility > 88 %; fat digestibility > 97 %). There were minor changes in fermentative end-product concentrations, but fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations were increased (P< 0. 05) with inulin and YCW inclusion in dogs fed beef-based diets. Fecal spermine concentrations were increased (P< 0. 05) with inulin and YCW inclusion. In general, blood cell populations and metabolites were within the normal ranges for dogs. To evaluate the standardized amino acid digestibility of the six raw meat-based diets, a cecectomized rooster assay was conducted. Twenty-four, Single Comb White Leghorn cecectomized roosters were used in this study. Each rooster was crop-intubated and given an average of 24 g of each test diet. All excreta were collected and amino acid concentrations measured in each sample. The results of the cecectomized rooster assay indicate that the standardized amino acid digestibility was high for all diets; however, differences in amino acid digestibility existed between protein sources. The beef control diet had the lowest total essential amino acid (TEAA), total non-essential amino acid (TNEAA), and total amino acid (TAA) digestibilities (90. 2, 88. 7, and 85. 9 %, respectively) and the chicken + inulin diet had the highest TEAA, TNEAA, and TAA digestibilities (95. 6, 95. 2, and 92. 2 %, respectively). Our results agree with those from feline studies demonstrating a high nutrient digestibility of raw diets. Inulin and YCW inclusion in raw meat-based diets had similar effects on large intestinal fermentation as extruded diets containing inulin and YCW. More research is needed to confirm our data and study such diets when fed long term...|$|R

These studies {{may be useful in}} risk-stratification, monitoring for relapse, and understanding tumor evolution.

However, ongoing germline research in pediatric oncology generally requires obtaining blood samples in EDTA tubes, which <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> a WBC-stabilizing <b>preservative.</b> In this study, we explored whether blood samples collected in WBC-stabilizing tubes could be used for both liquid biopsy and germline studies simultaneously, minimizing blood collection volumes for pediatric patients.

Germline DNA was extracted from all blood samples and subjected to whole-exome sequencing and microarray profiling. Quality control metrics of DNA quality, sequencing library preperation and whole-exome sequencing alignment were virtually identical regardless of the sample collection method. There was no discernable difference in patterns of variant calling for paired samples by either whole-exome sequencing or microarray analysis. Our study demonstrates that high-quality genomic studies may be performed from germline DNA obtained in Streck tubes. Therefore, these tubes may be used to simultaneously obtain samples for both liquid biopsy and germline studies in pediatric patients when the volume of blood available for research studies may be limited...|$|R
30|$|Propofol, {{chemically}} named 2, 6 -diisopropylphenol, is {{a highly}} effective and rapid intravenous anesthetics, which has gained increasing popularity in anesthesia in clinic. Its greatest advantage is the rapid recovery, even after long periods of anesthesia. A particularly low incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was also observed [1, 2]. However, it also has some drawbacks such as poor water miscibility (150 μg/L) [3] and high lipophilicity (logP = 4.16) [4]. As vehicles for clinical delivery of anesthetics should be devoid of sedative and anesthetic properties, as well as toxic side effects, nearly all small-molecular weight organic solvents into which propofol is freely miscible are not useful. Therefore, propofol was initially formulated as a 1 % solution in 16 % Cremophor EL, which {{has been reported to}} induce undesirable side effects, such as the high occurrence of pain on injection and the risk of anaphylactic reactions associated to Cremophor EL. In view of the clinical importance of propofol, the alternative formulations such as oil/water emulsion consisting of soya bean oil, glycerol, and egg phosphatide (Diprivan®, Zeneca, UK) [5], microemulsions [6], inclusion complex [1], and polymeric micelles [7, 8], have been developed to improve its solubility. Unfortunately, lipid-based emulsions suffer from other limitations including poor physical stability and the potential for embolism. Strictly aseptic techniques must be maintained when handling these formulations since they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> antimicrobial <b>preservatives,</b> and the vehicle can support rapid growth of microorganisms [9, 10]. Among other particulate vehicles, polymeric micelles have presented their great potential in solubilization of poorly water-soluble drugs in recent years [11 – 14]. Generally, block copolymers with concentration above the critical micellization concentration (CMC) self-assemble into spherical polymeric micelles with a core-shell structure in water: the hydrophobic segments aggregate to form an inner core being able to accommodate hydrophobic drugs with improved solubility by hydrophobic interactions; the hydrophilic shell consists of a brush-like protective corona that stabilizes the micelles in aqueous solution [15 – 17]. Polymeric micelles as novel drug vehicles present numerous advantages, such as reduced side effects of drugs, selective targeting, stable storage, and stability toward dilution [17, 18]. Furthermore, polymeric micelles possess a nanoscaled size with a narrow distribution. They can protect drugs against oxidation in vitro and premature degradation in vivo owing to their core-shell architecture [19, 20]. More importantly, polymeric micelles are fabricated according to the physicochemical properties of drugs and the compatibility between the core of micelles and drug molecules [14, 21]. Unfavorably, propofol-loaded polymeric micelles formed from poly(N-vinyl- 2 -pyrrolidone)-block-poly(d,l-lactide) (PVP-PLA) copolymers [7, 8], the drug loading content (LC) was extremely low (7 to 12 %). Therefore, there has been an urgent quest to develop an ideal polymeric micelles formulation that can solubilize propofol efficiently and solve some of the aforementioned problems.|$|R
40|$|AbstractOur {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} effect of commonly used milk preservatives on the accuracy of fat, protein, and lactose content determination in milk by mid-infrared (mid-IR) milk analysis. Two producer raw milks (Holstein and Jersey) and 2 pasteurized modified milks, 1 similar to Holstein milk and 1 similar to Jersey milk were used as the 4 different milk sources. Seven different milk preservative approaches (K 2 Cr 2 O 7 and 6 different bronopol-based preservatives) and a portion of unpreserved milk for each of the 4 different milks sources were tested for fat B, lactose, protein, and fat A. The experiment was replicated 3 times (28 d each) for a total of 84 d. Two mid-infrared (mid-IR) transmittance milk analyzers (an optical and a virtual filter instrument) were used. A large batch of pilot milk was prepared from pasteurized, homogenized, unpreserved whole milk, split into vials, quick frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen, and transferred into a − 80 °C freezer. Pilots were thawed and analyzed on each testing day during the study. Significant increases were observed in all uncorrected readings on the pilot milks over the 84 d of the study, but the increases were gradual and small on each instrument for all components. Results from the study were corrected for these changes. A significant difference in mid-IR fat A readings was observed, whereas no differences were detected for fat B, lactose, or protein between unpreserved and preserved milks containing 0. 02 % K 2 Cr 2 O 7. Therefore, K 2 Cr 2 O 7 has little or no effect on mid-IR test results. All bronopol-based preservative approaches in this study differed in mid-IR test results compared with K 2 Cr 2 O 7 -preserved and unpreserved milks, with the largest effect on protein results. Mid-IR uncorrected readings increased with time of refrigerated storage at 4 °C for all preservative approaches, with the largest increase for protein. The rate of increase in uncorrected readings with time of storage was always higher for raw milks than for pasteurized milks, and the stability of instrument zero was lower for raw milks than for pasteurized milks. The largest economic effect of a systematic bias caused by a preservative occurs when the milks used for calibration and routine testing for payment <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>contain</b> the same <b>preservative</b> or when calibration milks are preserved and milks for routine testing are unpreserved. These effects can create errors in payment for large dairy processing plants ranging from several hundred thousand to over a million dollars annually...|$|R
