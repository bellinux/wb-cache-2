40|$|Abstract — TCP is {{designed}} for networks with assumption that major losses occur only due to congestion of network traffic. On a wireless network TCP misinterprets the transmission losses due to bit errors and handoffs as losses caused by congestion, and triggers congestion control mechanisms. Because of its <b>end</b> to <b>end</b> <b>delivery</b> model, congestion handling and avoidance mechanisms, TCP has been widely accepted as Transport layer protocol for internetworks. Extension of Internetworks over wireless links is inevitable with the spread of ubiquitous computing and mobile communications. This paper presents study of different mechanisms proposed to extend Transport Control Protocol and other alternate solutions to enhance end to end performance over lossy wireless links.

40|$|Adhoc {{network is}} a {{collection}} of mobile nodes and wireless communication network is used to connect these mobile nodes. This type of network is known as MOBILE ADHOC NETWORK (MANET). TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) was designed to provide reliable <b>end</b> to <b>end</b> <b>delivery</b> of data over unreliable network. Traditionally TCP assumes that all the packet losses are due to congestion. Most TCP deployments have been carefully designed in the context of wired networks. Ignoring the properties of wireless Adhoc networks can lead to the implementations with poor performance. In order to adapt TCP to wireless network, improvements have been proposed in the literature to detect different types of losses. Indeed, in mobile or static Adhoc networks losses are not always due to network congestion, as it is in case of the wired networks. So, we presented some simulations analysis of TCP, TCP New Reno, TCP SACK, TCP Vegas, and TCP Westwood over DSDV, DSR and AODV in ns 2...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Delay and {{disruption}} tolerant networks {{have been proposed}} to address data communication challenges in network scenarios where an instantaneous end-to-end path between a source and destination may not exist, and the links between nodes may be opportunistic, predictably connectable, or periodically-(dis) connected. In this paper, we describe the store-and-forward and custody transfer concepts {{that are used in}} DTNs. Then, we present simulation results that illustrate the usefulness of the custody transfer feature, and a message ferry in improving the end-to-end message delivery ratio in a multihop scenario where link availability can be as low as 20 %. In particular, our results indicate that one can achieve a delivery ratio as high as 90 - 99 % with appropriate buffer allocations. We also provide some preliminary insights on the design factors that influence the <b>end</b> to <b>end</b> <b>delivery</b> ratio, e. g., the link availability patterns and buffer allocation strategies.

40|$|In Mobile Adhoc Networks (MANET), {{various types}} of Denial of Service Attacks (DoS) are {{possible}} because of the inherent limitations of its routing protocols. MANET rely on cooperation of all participating nodes, thus they are vulnerable to selfish nodes. An individual mobile node may attempt to benefit from other nodes, but refuse to share its own resources. Such nodes are called selfish or misbehaving nodes. These selfish nodes may severely affect the performance of network. Selfish node attack {{is a kind of}} Passive attack. In this paper misbehavior of Selfish Nodes is evaluated by finding the packet delivery ratio, energy consumption, <b>end</b> to <b>end</b> <b>delivery</b> and collisions by varying node mobility and number of attackers. Misbehaving nodes presence is one major security threat in MANET that can affect the performance of the under-lying protocols. Experiments are performed by implementing this through simulation using Glomosim Simulator and use AODV routing protocol. Results show that this drops the network performance...|$|R
