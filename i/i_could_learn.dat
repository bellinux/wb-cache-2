500|$|Most of Hutcherson's {{childhood}} {{was spent on}} film sets {{rather than in a}} classroom. He attended New Haven Elementary School in Union until he began his career at the age of nine, after which he began homeschooling, with his mother as his teacher. He later returned to Kentucky to attend Ryle High School for one semester. Hutcherson played on the high school's soccer team and has been a keen sports enthusiast since, also displaying a passion for football and tennis. At the age of 13, he participated in a triathlon. He later said of his schooling experiences, [...] "I know it's something kids have to deal with every single day but getting {{up at the same time}} every day and having to listen to teachers talk about things <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>learn</b> so much more easily on my own, I hated it." ...|$|E
500|$|Roosevelt {{supported}} increased {{roles for}} women and African-Americans in the war effort, and began to advocate for women to be given factory jobs a year before it became a widespread practice. In 1942, she urged women of all social backgrounds to learn trades, saying: [...] "if I were of a debutante age I would go into a factory–any factory where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>learn</b> a skill and be useful." [...] Roosevelt learned of {{the high rate of}} absenteeism among working mothers, and she campaigned for government-sponsored day care. She notably supported the Tuskegee Airmen in their successful effort to become the first black combat pilots, visiting the Tuskegee Air Corps Advanced Flying School in Alabama. She also flew with African-American chief civilian instructor C. Alfred [...] "Chief" [...] Anderson. Anderson had been flying since 1929 and was responsible for training thousands of rookie pilots; he took her on a half-hour flight in a Piper J-3 Cub. After landing, she cheerfully announced, [...] "Well, you can fly all right." [...] The subsequent brouhaha over the First Lady's flight had such an impact it is often mistakenly cited as the start of the Civilian Pilot Training Program at Tuskegee, even though the program was already five months old. Eleanor Roosevelt did use her position as a trustee of the Julius Rosenwald Fund to arrange a loan of $175,000 to help finance the building of Moton Field.|$|E
2500|$|Robert E. Lee made a {{synopsis}} {{of the events}} that took place at Harpers Ferry. According to Lee's notes, Lee believed John Brown was a madman, [...] "...the plan [...] was the attempt of a fanatic or madman." [...] Lee also believed that the blacks in the raid were forced by Brown. [...] "The blacks, whom he [...] forced from their homes in this neighborhood, as far as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>learn,</b> gave him no voluntary assistance." [...] Lee attributed John Brown's [...] "temporary success" [...] by creating panic and confusion and by [...] "magnifying" [...] the number of participants involved in the raid.|$|E

2500|$|Swift {{explained}} to Billboard. [...] "I {{think the reason}} I said that was because I made the record {{exactly the same way}} I made the last three. I knew I hadn't jumped out of my comfort zone, which at the time was writing alone and working with Nathan. [...] the song was a real turning point for Red the album. When I wrote that song my mind started wandering to all the places we could go. If I were to think outside the box enough, go in with different people, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>learn</b> from and have what they do rub off on me as well as have what I do rub off on them." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{completing}} {{her role}} in How The West Was Won, Bazlen returned to Chicago where she appeared in many stage roles until 1966 when she gave up performing to marry the French singer Jean-Paul Vignon. The marriage produced one daughter (Marguerite Vignon – the birth coming as a pleasant surprise to Bazlen {{as she had been}} told that she would never have children. Indeed, it was only 4 months into the pregnancy that she found out she was pregnant), but ended in divorce. Bazlen later married Nashville session player/producer Marlin Greene. This marriage also ended in divorce after 7 years. At the time her acting career was at its zenith in 1961/62, she said that her ideal marriage would take place when she was between 20 and 22 years of age and to [...] "someone 10 to 20 years my senior, preferably not an actor. Marriages between actors seldom work out satisfactorily. If it is an actor I marry, it won't be a young one. I find young actors are too egotistical. I prefer more mature men; James Stewart is a wonderful example.". She also added that the person she would like to marry would be [...] "Someone <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>learn</b> from." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a documentary, Jay-Z {{revealed}} being {{inspired by}} a segment of Jackson's tour in which she stood in silence {{and stared at the}} crowd for several minutes to massive applause; imitating the technique during his own concerts. Beyoncé has also been reported to emulate a similar tactic during several live shows. JoJo praised the tour, tweeting [...] "Janet Jackson Velvet Rope Tour DVD. Freaking out. Mesmerized. Living. Can't stop yelling at the tv screen. Omg." [...] JoJo later recorded the album Agápē while The Velvet Rope Tour played on a studio television for inspiration. Canadian singer Anjulie became [...] "obsessed with music" [...] and [...] "developed [...] through watching" [...] the tour, recalling [...] "I remember seeing The Velvet Rope Tour and then getting the VHS of that, putting it on slow motion so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>learn</b> every single dance move." [...] British artist Rowdy Superstar commended Jackson's performance of [...] "If" [...] and [...] "stayed up the whole night learning all the choreography from the Velvet Rope Tour." [...] BBC Asian Network presenter DJ Kayper called Jackson [...] "hands down, the best female performer of all time", praising the tour's rendition of [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] in which Jackson dances with nunchucks.|$|E

6000|$|Ethel laughed. [...] "That's {{the third}} thing you have taught me--to thread a needle, tie a bow, and stick in a pin! <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> <b>learn</b> those things of any one else; they show, but don't explain the theory." ...|$|R

6000|$|The American laughed. [...] "If I didn't, I guess <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>learn.</b> It can't {{be harder}} than playing the fiddle, and I've worried into that." ...|$|E

6000|$|SHE: [...] "Please {{sit down}} while I write a receipt." [...] She places herself {{deliberately}} at the table, and opens her portfolio.

60|$|At midnight I {{was startled}} {{by the sound of}} horses' hoofs and the {{jingling}} of spurs below. A conversation between my host and some mysterious personage in the darkness was carried on in such a low tone that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>learn</b> its import. As the cavalcade rode away I raised the window.|$|R

"That {{will be very}} nice," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "and if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> but <b>learn</b> to {{understand}} in that way what people say, instead of watching their fingers (and some of them don't know the alphabet, and some who do are so slow that one loses all patience), it would be delightful." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But I {{have liked}} you so well,--so {{much better than}} all others! A dozen men have asked me to marry them. And though they might be nothing till they made that request, then they became--things of horror to me.

6000|$|... "What is vital, {{and what}} is not? If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>learn</b> that! But you always argue in a circle.

50|$|I {{suppose the}} world has heard of the famous Solomon Eagle, an enthusiast.

6000|$|... 'No, no: don't {{misunderstand}} me. The {{fault is}} in myself. If {{it was not}} for that, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>learn</b> nothing but good,' said Guy, speaking very eagerly, distressed at her answer.|$|E
