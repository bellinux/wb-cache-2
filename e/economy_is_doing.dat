5000|$|The most {{commonly}} discussed effect of paper wealth is the wealth effect: as people (households) increase in wealth, {{they are likely}} to spend more, while if their wealth decreases, {{they are likely to}} spend less. This is termed [...] "the wealth effect" [...] (compare income effect), and is generally attributed to psychological feelings of confidence - one feels rich, so one spends. The significance of the wealth effect is debated; it is generally procyclical, meaning that when the <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> well, asset prices increase, causing consumers to spend more, which provides further stimulus to the economy and risks causing overheating. Conversely, if the <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing</b> poorly, asset prices fall and consumers spend less, leading to a vicious cycle and potentially a depression.|$|E

40|$|Sadly for New Labour, {{and indeed}} {{for anyone who}} cares about the future of {{progressive}} politics in the UK, we are back to a state of affairs from which, for the last decade at least, we have been relatively free. We are back into an election cycle dominated by the poor performance of the UK economy. Prior to 1997, the normal driver of electoral politics in the post-war UK was the state of the economy. As James Carville once famously told Bill Clinton, ‘it’s the economy, stupid’. The normal pattern was that, if the <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> well, the party currently in office stayed in office; and if the <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> badly, the party in office did badly too. Indeed, the more individual voters felt personally impacted by exposure to unemploy-ment or to its threat, the more likely were they to turn to some new political formation {{in order to avoid the}} loss of their job and the diminution of their income. The UK <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> currently <b>doing</b> very badly, and the number of voters directly impacted by exposure to unemployment or to its threat is at a twenty-year high; so if the normal pattern of electoral politics in the post-war UK holds, the chances of New Labour keeping the Tories at bay look, at best, extraordinarily long and at worst, next t...|$|R

5000|$|In {{real estate}} investing, the due-on-sale clause {{can be an}} {{impediment}} for a property owner who wishes to sell the property and have the buyer take over an existing loan rather than paying the loan off {{as part of the}} sale. Likewise, a due-on-sale clause would interfere with a seller's extension of financing to a buyer by using a wraparound mortgage, also called an [...] "all-inclusive mortgage", [...] "all-inclusive deed of trust", [...] "all-inclusive trust deed", or [...] "AITD." [...] Any of these arrangements triggers the due-on-sale clause in the seller's existing mortgage and thus the lender may call the loan due. If a property with a due-on-sale clause in the mortgage loan is transferred and the loan is not paid off, the bank could call the loan and then foreclose on the property if the buyer is unable to immediately tender the entire remaining balance on the loan. How likely this is depends on how the real estate <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing.</b> If the buyer continues to pay the loan payments when due, it is less likely that the bank would actually call the loan due but it is still the bank's choice.|$|E
