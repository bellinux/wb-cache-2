500|$|UPN {{requested}} a modified ending to the episode, {{as the original}} version had Phlox and Archer disagreeing {{over what to do}} with the Valakians. Archer would have wanted to save the race, while Phlox would have wanted evolution to take its course. John Billingsley, who played Doctor Phlox in Enterprise, didn't agree with the changed version, saying [...] "the ending that had initially been created I was fairly comfortable with. But the head of the studio suggested some revisions on the ending. What do you do? I wasn't as happy with the revisions, but it's not my show, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> adjust, even if sometimes it does seem a bit of a contradiction in terms for what your character is supposed to be about." ...|$|E
5000|$|Of the song's chords, Page remarked: It's in A, {{and then}} it sort of goes to an E chord. But then, while it's snaking around it, it has some sort of little {{triplets}} that take you back into the A. So, yes, it's tricky. You just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> know how to count it.|$|E
5000|$|Cave later said, [...] "Before I {{was able}} to write things like, 'I'm not afraid to die'. And kids {{come up to me}} and say, 'Hey, that line means so much to me'. And I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> say I don't feel that way any more. I don't feel as cocky about death as I used to. I wake up in mad panics about death approaching." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to O'Regan, his Diamond Rings persona exists [...] "to sort of smash {{that kind}} of {{tendency}} that I think we all <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> hide behind ourselves. And I think this record's probably, or definitely, my strongest statement that I've made to date." [...] He also says {{a big part of}} this album was [...] "becoming more comfortable as a musician and a composer and an arranger", and [...] "I felt like I really stepped up as a singer with this album, and I’m really proud of that.” ...|$|E
5000|$|... "At first I {{was really}} scared of it, {{which is why}} I was {{constantly}} fighting and having such an attitude about it. I was really defensive because I would fight, not who I am or him, but just {{what was going to}} happen. I was defensive. But once I got that out of my system -- trying to fight to be that whole thing -- what came out of my heart just came out. And I embrace it wholeheartedly now because you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> just go through things and grow, and, throughout that process, I think that was what ended up happening."

5000|$|Added Hurley: [...] "I've been on film {{sets for}} about nine {{years as a}} hired hand so it wasn't that I didn't know anything.... Yes, there are things I know now that I didn't know before. But there are things a monkey could learn to do.... I think {{learning}} to keep {{on top of things}} ... You <b>have</b> <b>to,</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of,</b> learn that as you go. I hadn't realized how fragile a film could be. I did end up being very hands-on. I ended up doing much more than I had expected to. I didn't realize {{how easy it was to}} really not make the film you set out to make.... I think having to concentrate very, very hard on every department was a shock." ...|$|E

5000|$|Joe Russo {{highlighted}} the film's large scope, {{saying that the}} audience would [...] "not be disappointed {{in the amount of}} characters" [...] featured in the films, adding that they had a character board showing all previously introduced and available MCU characters [...] "with like 67 characters on it." [...] Markus and McFeely clarified that having that many characters available to them did not mean that all would appear in the films or be lead roles, and also noted the board did not include any potential new characters. On whether choosing the characters to appear in the film were personal preferences or dictated by the story, Anthony Russo said, [...] "It's a little bit of both, because you always {{have to make sure that}} your choices feel organic to the storytelling, and really, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> structure them in the way that they need to be there... It's a little bit of a dance between the two, where you have big eyes, and you want everybody included in the movie, but you have to go through the process of... what's the best story that you can tell." ...|$|E
5000|$|For the music, Björk {{related the}} {{phenomenon}} the song describes to a musical structure or resource. For example; the song [...] "Moon" [...] has different musical cycles that repeat throughout the song; the song [...] "Thunderbolt" [...] contains arpeggios, {{inspired by the}} time between when lightning is seen and thunder is heard; and in [...] "Solstice", the counterpoint makes reference to the movement of planets and the Earth's rotation, and the pendulums used on the song make tribute to the Foucault pendulum.The lyrics also present metaphors to those phenomena. [...] "Dark Matter" [...] features heavy gibberish since the dark matter phenomena are directly [...] "unexplainable". [...] "Virus" [...] describes [...] "fatal relationships" [...] such as {{the relationship between a}} virus and a cell, as Björk explained: [...] "It's like I have this new neighbour that I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> learn to live with"; [...] "Solstice" [...] presents the relation between the gravity effect on celestial bodies, comparing the solar system to a Christmas tree. and in [...] "Hollow", Björk took inspiration from her [...] "ancestors and DNA, that the grounds open below you and you can feel your mother and her mother, and her mother, and her mother, and her mother 30,000 years back. So suddenly you're this kinda tunnel, or trunk of DNA… All these ghosts come up so it ended up being a Halloween song and quite gothic in a way… It's like being part of this everlasting necklace when you're just a bead on a chain and you sort of want to belong and {{be a part of it}} and it's just like a miracle." ...|$|E
5000|$|To prepare {{themselves}} for the role, Winstead and Orser read the book Let Our Children Go by Ted Patrick and watched YouTube videos from that era of people in cults or people who had just gotten out of cults. They had both also created their own backstories for their characters based on Stearns' script. Winstead has repeatedly mentioned that Claire is her most challenging role to date. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> play a few different characters {{over the course of}} the film and I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> really keep track from scene to scene to remind myself of where she was," [...] Winstead says.|$|R

5000|$|Because of the series' {{focus on}} Klingons and their culture, the {{producers}} decided {{that members of}} the species would speak their own language with subtitles throughout the show, which Berg said was [...] "very important for us ... They have their own pride. They have their own interests and talent. It's a very fascinating culture." [...] Noting that the Klingons historically represented the Soviet Union, becoming friendlier with the protagonists of Star Trek as the Cold War ended, Harberts stated that in Discovery they and Starfleet would represent different factions within the modern United States, explaining that [...] "what we really wanted to do too is understand two differing points of view and really explore it ... I frankly love what they represent. Not in terms necessarily of all the messaging, but in terms of learning about them and learning why they are who they are and making sure they aren't just the enemy. And then finding a way to come together. How do we bring everyone back together? What do we do? What does it take? It is a big challenge for us, but that is what season one is all about." [...] Martin-Green furthered this, noting that The Walking Dead had also explored this idea of acculturation, and how [...] "we don't have to let go of who we are in order to learn who you are. We can do it at the same time." [...] Berg elaborated that [...] "one of the themes we are exploring is universal and is a lesson I feel like as human beings we have to learn over and over again—is you think you know ‘the other,' but you really don't. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> cognitively re-frame or break or deviate from your own point of view to really understand. You have to forget what you knew before. One of the big steps in that journey is how to understand yourself. You have to understand yourself before you can better see others. The show is called Discovery and it is called Discovery for a reason, because our characters are on a journey." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} part of qualifying, Massa set the fastest time, taking pole {{position}} from second placed Alonso {{in the last}} few seconds as rain began to fall, with Räikkönen completing the top three. Massa's lap of 1:35.043 marked tyre company Bridgestone's 100th pole position in Formula One. Hamilton came fourth, over half a second behind the leading three. He conceded inexperience was to blame, saying that there were [...] "some spots of rain on my visor, so I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> let off".

5000|$|RUBY chose {{abuse and}} neglect as a key theme as she [...] "...was really {{interested}} in taking on {{a different type of}} narrator. Most of my girls are from upper middle class families, living in pretty solid environments. I was intrigued by taking a girl who WASN'T like that at all and dropping her into this whole new world. I liked the idea that you'd think it would solve all her problems—having a roof over her head, money, a family—but that it actually brought up a whole other set to deal with. Also, I liked the idea <b>of</b> my narrator <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> [...] "save" [...] someone else in order to save herself." ...|$|R

Sessions were due to begin at London's RAK Studio in January with Radiohead's producer of choice, John Leckie; however, fellow Oxford band Ride asked Leckie to perform some last-minute work on their forthcoming album Carnival of Light. Radiohead postponed {{the start of the}} album's recording to 24 February to accommodate, and used the extra time to practice their songs; Yorke said: [...] "We had all of these songs and we really liked them, but we knew them almost too well [...] [...] [...] so we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> learn <b>to</b> like them again before we could record them, which is odd." ...|$|R
