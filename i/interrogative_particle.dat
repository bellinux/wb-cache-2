25|$|Grammatical {{differences}} between informal spoken Quebec French and the formal language abound. Some of these, such as omission {{of the negative}} particle ne, are also present in the informal language of speakers of standard European French, while other features, such as use of the <b>interrogative</b> <b>particle</b> -tu, are either peculiar to Quebec or Canadian French or restricted to nonstandard varieties of European French.|$|E
500|$|Intonation often conveys {{semantic}} {{context in}} Khmer, as in distinguishing declarative statements, questions and exclamations. The available grammatical means of making such distinctions {{are not always}} used, or may be ambiguous; for example, the final <b>interrogative</b> <b>particle</b> [...] can also serve as an emphasizing (or in some cases negating) particle.|$|E

2500|$|To say no is {{as simple}} as saying ບໍ່ (bo [...] ), and {{negation}} simply involves placing that word in front of the verb, adjective, adverb, or noun to be negated. To say yes, especially to indicate that one ia listening, one uses ໂດຽ (doi [...] ), especially in formal situations, or ເຈົ້າ (chao [...] ). To answer a question, one often repeats the verb of action that was used in the question to indicate that that action was or will be completed. One can also use [...] ແມ່ນ (mén [...] ), especially if the question had ແມ່ນ, as an element of the <b>interrogative</b> <b>particle.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Old Irish verbs {{that have}} no prefixes, called [...] "simple verbs", have two sets of endings, {{absolute}} and conjunct. The conjunct endings are used after a variety of grammatical particles, including among others the negative particle [...] ("not"), the <b>interrogative</b> <b>particle</b> , and prepositions combined with the relative pronoun (e.g. [...] "with which"). Where no such [...] "conjunct particle" [...] is present, the absolute endings are used. For example, [...] "he calls" [...] is [...] (absolute), while [...] "he does not call" [...] is [...] and [...] "with which he calls" [...] is [...] (both conjunct). (An interpunct [...] "·", hyphen [...] "-", or colon [...] ":" [...] is usually used to indicate conjunct forms in pedagogical and analytical works on Old Irish. Actual manuscripts do not use such punctuation marks.) When a particle is present, stress falls on the first syllable of the verb itself, i.e. the syllable after the [...] "·" [...] mark.|$|E

40|$|Abstract According to Usage-based Theory (Tomasello 2006), {{children}} acquire wh- {{questions by}} initially producing concrete formula structures {{that happen to}} be very frequent in the input. In this research we analyze the wh-questions produced by three Spanish-speaking children (age range: 0; 11 - 3; 11) in longitudinal samples of spontaneous speech {{to determine whether the}} Usage-based Theory can explain the wh-question acquisition in Spanish. Results show that: i) the first wh-questions are formula, that appeared with few <b>interrogative</b> <b>particles,</b> and that are highly frequent in the input; ii) as the child develops, wh-questions become more complex, in which this structures are produced with more varied <b>interrogative</b> <b>particles</b> and different verbs; iii) the input seems to play a relevant role in the acquisition of wh-questions. Results seem to validate the Usage-based Theory...|$|R
500|$|There {{are three}} basic types of {{questions}} in Khmer. Questions requesting specific information use question words.

5000|$|Another major {{difference}} is in question-forming. In Polish, questions {{that do not}} contain interrogative words are formed either by using intonation or the <b>interrogative</b> <b>particle</b> [...] In Silesian, questions that do not contain interrogative words are formed by using intonation (with a markedly different intonation pattern than in Polish) or inversion (e.g. [...] ); there is no <b>interrogative</b> <b>particle.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{serves as}} an {{investigation}} into the differences between <b>interrogative</b> sentence-final <b>particles</b> (SFPs) and tag questions (tags) in Taiwanese. What we are concerned with is the discrepancies found among the lists of interrogative SFPs in the literature. To distinguish tags from the <b>interrogative</b> <b>particles</b> (PRTs), a testing procedure is devised based on the proposal for testing negative particles (NEG-PRTs) in Hsieh (2001). We conclude that buē, bē, bô, m, honn, m̄, ma, nih are interrogative SFPs and hiòo, m-me(me), sī [...] bô, sī-m̄ (sìm) and sioh are tag questions. Among the interrogative SFPs, buē, bē, bô, and m are negative-particles which occur under IP, honn, m̄, ma, and nih are particles which perch higher, under CP. We believe that distinguishing SFPs from tags is the foundation of a solid investigation into SFPs...|$|R

50|$|Interrogative {{sentences}} {{can serve}} as yes-no questions or as wh-questions, the latter being formed using an interrogative word such as who, which, where or how to specify the information required.

Particles are words that do not take affixes; they mostly function in adverbial roles, and include such things as <b>interrogative</b> <b>particles,</b> affirmative/negative words, markers of time and location, conjunctions, prepositions and demonstratives.|$|R
