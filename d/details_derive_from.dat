50|$|Former Graham Foundation {{director}} Carter Manny {{described the}} Madlener House as “an unusually successful amalgamation {{of tradition and}} innovation in architecture, a harmonious reflection of its time and place.” This amalgamation refers to the eclectic usages of then-popular architectural styles in the Midwest and abroad, {{as well as the}} incorporation of both organic and geometric design elements. The high-ceiling, cubic foundation of the house is an influence of the German Neoclassical work of Karl Friedrich Schinkel and others in Berlin, Germany. However, many of the house’s <b>details</b> <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> Chicago’s own Prairie School movement, made famous by Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright. Past writings have compared the Madlener House to both Villa Shone in Berlin and Frank Lloyd’s Wright’s Winslow House in River Forest, Illinois. Other details of the house’s interior reflect the International Arts and Crafts movement, popular {{at the time of the}} house’s construction at the turn of the twentieth century.|$|E
5000|$|English Heritage {{describes}} the building's design as [...] "unusual". The stylistic <b>details</b> <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> the French Baroque {{style of the}} late 17th century. The building is V-shaped, of two main storeys with double attics in red brick under a slate roof. The Pillory Street façade, of eight bays, is approximately double {{the length of the}} Hospital Street façade, which has four bays. The curved corner, of a further three bays, forms the junction of the two streets with High Street, and is finished with a concave spirelet, giving a dome-like appearance. The spirelet bears a flag pole. The ground floor has cream-coloured rendering with a string course above, and part of the first floor and lower attic level is also rendered.The main entrance is at the curved corner; the doorcase has flanking pilasters with a pediment above. A second entrance takes the place of one of the original windows on the Pillory Street face, while the original second doorway {{at the end of this}} face is now blind. The windows flanking the main doorway and two others on the Pillory Street face have rectangular heads; the other ground-floor windows have semicircular heads. In both cases, the top part is divided into small panes (now obscured by modern shop-window hoods). The ground-floor shop windows are all flanked by pilasters and topped with moulding detail including a keystone-like feature that reaches the string course. The mullioned and transomed first-floor windows have horizontal heads with brick keystone detailing. The two attic storeys each have a row of circular dormer windows in the steep roof, the lower set being decorated below with festoons of fruit and flowers, which differ in detail from window to window. The drainpipe heads are all inscribed with 1911 in a lozenge pattern.|$|E

40|$|Scholarship on The Battle of Maldon {{has focused}} {{largely on the}} poem’s his-toricity: it has grappled {{primarily}} with questions of how faithfully the poet represents the events of 10 August 991, {{how many of the}} poem’s <b>details</b> <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> firsthand knowledge of the battle, and how many of those <b>details</b> <b>derive</b> <b>from</b> the literary conventions of Old English heroic poetry. 1 A question that this scholarship often neglects, or deals with only in pass-ing, is that of the poem’s politics: how it engages with pressing political questions, what ideologies it supports, what policies it encourages, and so forth. The apparent reason for this elision is that, for many scholars, the poem’s politics seems so obvious that it does not merit lengthy discus-sion. The longstanding assumption has been that, if the poet is making any contribution to contemporary debates over whether the Viking threat should be handled with battle or with tribute money, he surely advocates the former; and if the poet is asking anything of his audience, it surely is fiercer and more heroic resistance to the Vikings. 2 Simon Keynes, in an essay on The Battle of Maldon’s historical context that touches briefly on the poem’s politics, writes: “[I]t is possible that the poem on the battle of Maldon was formulated against the background of such a [tribute] debate; and while the poet, through the messenger, presents a reasoned case for the payment of tribute, there is no mistaking where his true sym-pathies lie. ” 3 Similarly, Ralph W.

40|$|Traditionally {{materials}} {{have been associated}} with a series of physical properties that can be used as inputs to production and manufacturing.

40|$|The opening {{section of}} the Old English poem The Phoenix <b>derives</b> <b>from</b> a fourth-century Latin poem, Carmen de ave phoenice, which is usually {{attributed}} to Lactantius.

The poet of The Phoenix’s expansions have been dismissed as prolix, yet when examined in light of similar passages elsewhere in the corpus of Old English literature, these additions can be seen to introduce images of particular resonance. This essay will focus on the landscape of the poem’s opening to argue for the Anglo-Saxon poet’s introduction of a distinctively insular spatial imaginaire to the setting inherited from the Latin source material. This insular imaginaire is in keeping with general trends in Anglo-Saxon literary culture, and ensures the resonance of The Phoenix’s resurrection allegory with its Anglo-Saxon audience...|$|R

30|$|Drawing on a {{synthesis}} of Halliday’s [2] triad construct of context of situation in systemic functional linguistics and Douglas’ [3] construct of discourse domain as a theoretical framework alongside the Specification of Generic (Foundation) Competencies (English) (SGC) [4], the analysis found that the numerous specific communicative events (when studied {{in conjunction with the}} contextual <b>details)</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> the data, such as replying to email/telephone enquiries, handling complaints, writing reports and proposals, taking part in discussions and meetings/negotiations, giving presentations, etc., are of various levels of complexity and familiarity and require language output of different levels of sophistication. Upon systematically mapping these real-life workplace communication tasks with the corresponding units of competency (UoCs) in the SGC according to the language skills/competency elements involved and the QF levels into which these tasks fit, the majority of these communicative events were found to cluster around those UoCs that are covered in the English curricula of the various VTC programs. This lends substantial empirical support for the relevance of these English modules to the generic language competencies needed in the actual workplace.|$|R
