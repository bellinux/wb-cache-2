40|$|A {{battery charger}} for {{incorporation}} into an <b>electric-powered</b> <b>vehicle</b> is disclosed. The charger includes a ferroresonant voltage-regulating circuit for providing an output voltage {{proportional to the}} frequency of an input AC voltage. A high frequency converter converts a DC voltage supplied, for example, from a rectifier connected to a standard AC outlet, to a controlled frequency AC voltage which is supplied to the input of the ferroresonant circuit. The ferroresonant circuit includes an output, a saturable core transformer connected across the output, and a first linear inductor and a capacitor connected in series across the saturable core transformer and tuned to resonate at the third harmonic of the AC voltage from the high frequency converter. The ferroresonant circuit further includes a second linear inductor connected between the input of the ferroresonant circuit and the saturable core transformer. The output voltage from the ferroresonant circuit is rectified and applied across a pair of output terminals adapted {{to be connected to}} the battery to be charged. A feedback circuit compares the voltage across the output terminals with a reference voltage and controls the frequency of the AC voltage produced by the high frequency converter to maintain the voltage across the output terminals at a predetermined value. The second linear inductor provides a highly reactive load {{in the event of a}} fault across the output terminals to render the charger short-circuit proof...|$|E

40|$|Electric and hybrid-electric {{vehicles}} are {{often referred to}} as quiet vehicles, comparatively to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. At first, these new vehicle types were mainly developed for urban situations for their qualities concerning air pollution reduction, but due to the improvement of their electric range, they can also be encountered on national road networks. The electric and hybrid powertrain technologies are mostly employed on light vehicles, but a more recent breakthrough of electro-mobility can also be observed in heavier vehicles, such as delivery trucks or buses. In the framework of the project FOREVER, supported within the CEDR-TRRP programme and which primarily aims to provide data and information on the potential future noise impacts of electric vehicles on national roads, noise emission levels from several electric and hybrid-electric vehicles have been investigated. Measurements carried out on an experimental test track covered with dense asphalt concrete included microphones at the standard position (distance 7. 5 m and height 1. 2 m) and a wide range of driving conditions (constant speed, acceleration, deceleration and braking) and vehicle speeds. The dataset has been completed with results already available by project partners. Global and frequency dependent results have been compared with the sound emission model provided in CNOSSOS-EU. When appropriate, an adaptation of CNOSSOS-EU input data is proposed, as a first step towards the specification of light <b>electric-powered</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the European traffic noise predicting method...|$|R
40|$|The {{reduction}} of air pollutants {{for the purpose}} of maintaining or improving air quality across the globe is a fundamental concern to which all modern governments are allocating varying amounts of attention and resources. The successful amelioration of air pollution requires strategic investments in the commercialization and adoption of "clean energy technologies" by both private and public entities, the conversion of contemporary houses to "smart houses", the diffusion of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) including photovoltaic systems (PV), wind farms, and different forms of bioenergy, and the integration of <b>electric-powered</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In concert with these ideas, this paper aims to discuss the possibility of undertaking a feasibility study in two countries Canada and Italy concerning the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) and electric motorcycles (EMs). The proposed feasibility study would seek to assess the prospect of replacing the current vehicle fleets in these two countries with EVs in a manner that utilizes renewable energy sources and, thus, does not generate new toxic emissions. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a pronounced introduction and distribution of RES, EVs, and EMs can operate as a great opportunity for both the environment and the capacities and needs of energy production. Today, the EV is not widespread. With this contribution, it is shown how EVs can be well integrated with renewable energy. Therefore, it is the duty of governments to implement policy strategies, in order to spread them across more territory...|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} forty years, United States Presidents have {{repeatedly}} {{called for a}} reduction in the country's dependence on fossil fuels in general and foreign oil specifically. Stronger efficiency standards and higher taxes on motor fuels are a step in this direction, but achieving even greater reductions in oil consumption will require changing the way Americans power their transportation system. Some officials advocate the electrification of the passenger vehicle fleet as a path to meeting this goal. The Obama administration has, for example, embraced a goal of having one million <b>electric-powered</b> <b>vehicles</b> on U. S. roads by 2015, while others proposed a medium-term goal where electric vehicles would consist of 20 % of the passenger vehicle fleet by 2030 [...] approximately 30 million electric vehicles. The technology itself is not in question [...] many of the global automobile companies are planning to sell plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and/or battery electric vehicles (BEVs) by 2012. The key question is, will Americans buy them? The answer depends on four additional questions: 1. Is the cost of purchasing and operating an electric vehicle more or less expensive than the cost of a comparable conventional gasoline-powered vehicle? 2. Are the comparative costs likely to change over the next twenty years? 3. Do electric vehicles provide the same attributes as conventional cars, and if not, do the differences matter? 4. Will electric car owners be able to access the electricity needed to power their vehicles? This paper attempts to answer these four questions. ...|$|R

40|$|Many of the {{applications}} pertinent to unmanned vehicles, such as environmental research and analysis, communications, and information-surveillance and reconnaissance, benefit from prolonged vehicle operation time. Conventional {{efforts to increase}} the operational time of <b>electric-powered</b> unmanned <b>vehicles</b> have traditionally focused {{on the design of}} energy-efficient components and the identification of energy efficient search patterns, while little {{attention has been paid to}} the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s mission-level path plan and power management. This thesis explores the formulation and generation of integrated motion-plans and power-schedules for solar-panel equipped mobile robots operating under strict energy constraints, which cannot be effectively addressed through conventional motion planning algorithms. Transit problems are considered to design time-optimal paths using both Balkcom-Mason and Pseudo-Dubins curves. Additionally, a more complicated problem to generate mission plans for vehicles which must persistently travel between certain locations, similar to the traveling salesperson problem (TSP), is presented. A comparison between one of the common motion-planning algorithms and experimental results of the prescribed algorithms, made possible by use of a test environment and mobile robot designed and developed specifically for this research, are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to present a life-cycle assessment of pollution from alternative transport fuels in Indian conditions. The present study is limited to gross carbon emission (as CO 2) because of its serious implications for global warming. Indicative values of gross carbon emissions from bioethanol, CNG and electrical energy sources have been evaluated from industrial data and compared with those from oil. The energy and environmental analyses of bioethanol production in India show that bioethanol can significantly reduce global CO 2 emissions and, if used as a petrol blend, can help reduce oil imports as well as aromatics pollution from unleaded petrol (now introduced into India). The method used in this research has two main components. The first is an examination of each energy industry in detail, using primary sources of data from power stations, oil refineries and anhydrous ethanol production from molasses. The processes involved in each case are examined, taking into account energy use in any necessary auxiliary activities to evaluate the total carbon emissions. The second component is a detailed examination of one specific form of public transport. This is a three-wheeled 8 -seater used {{in the city of}} Lucknow in North India. It is chosen because it is available with a petrol or compressed natural gas (CNG) spark-ignition engine (and hence could alternatively be ethanol-fuelled) and in a battery-electric version. Both parts of this data-gathering have been specific to the situation in India. In energy conversion the refinery crude composition and processes, basic resources of biomass and the mix of primary energy for electricity generation are different in each country. The types of vehicle used also vary considerably from region to region. It is observed that while CNG and <b>electric-powered</b> <b>vehicles</b> may have low and zero tailpipe emissions respectively, gross pollution from such vehicles and their associated resource systems may be significant. In the case of electrically-propelled vehicles the gross carbon emission is comparable with that for similar petrol-engine vehicles since about 80 % of electricity production in India is fossil-fuel-based. In comparison, CNG shows a reduction of about a third. Alcohol-fuelled vehicles, by comparison, can show neutral (i. e., zero net) carbon emission. The importance of gross pollution assessments in rational choice of a fuel cannot be overemphasised. © 2005 International Energy Initiative, Inc...|$|R

40|$|As {{the share}} of hybrid, plug-in hybrid (PHEV), {{electric}} (EV) and fuel-cell (FCV) vehicles grows in the national automotive fleet, an entirely new set of diagnostic and technical skills needs to be obtained by the maintenance workforce. Electrically-powered vehicles require new diagnostic tools, technique and vocabulary when compared to existing internal combustion engine-powered models. While the manufacturers of these new vehicles train their own maintenance personnel, training for students, independent working technicians and fleet operators is less focused and organized. This DOE-funded effort provided training to these three target groups to help expand availability of skills and to provide more competition (and lower consumer cost) in the maintenance of these hybrid- and <b>electric-powered</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Our approach was to start locally in the San Francisco Bay Area, one of the densest markets in the United States for these types of automobiles. We then expanded training to the Los Angeles area and then out-of-state to identify what types of curriculum was appropriate and what types of problems were encountered as training was disseminated. The fact that this effort trained up to 800 individuals with sessions varying from 2 - day workshops to full-semester courses is considered a successful outcome. Diverse programs were developed to match unique time availability and educational needs {{of each of the}} three target audiences. Several key findings and observations arising from this effort include: • Recognition that hybrid and PHEV training demand is immediate; demand for EV training is starting to emerge; while demand for FCV training is still over the horizon • Hybrid and PHEV training are an excellent starting point for all EV-related training as they introduce all the basic concepts (electric motors, battery management, controllers, vocabulary, testing techniques) that are needed for all EVs, and these skills are in-demand in today’s market. • Faculty training is widely available and can be relatively quickly achieved. Equipment availability (vehicles, specialized tools, diagnostic software and computers) is a bigger challenge for funding-constrained colleges. • A computer-based emulation system that would replicate vehicle and diagnostic software in one package is a training aid that would have widespread benefit, but does not appear to exist. This need is further described at the end of Section 6. 5. The benefits of this project are unique to each of the three target audiences. Students have learned skills they will use for the remainder of their careers; independent technicians can now accept customers who they previously needed to turn away due to lack of familiarity with hybrid systems; and fleet maintenance personnel are able to lower costs by undertaking work in-house that they previously needed to outsource. The direct job impact is estimated at 0. 75 FTE continuously over the 3 ½ -year duration of the grant...|$|R
