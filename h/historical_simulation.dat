First, we theoretically show that the VaR portfolio measure is subadditive in the relevant tail region if asset returns are multivariate regularly varying, thus allowing for dependent returns. Second, we note that VaR estimated from <b>historical</b> <b>simulations</b> may lead to violations of subadditivity. This upset of the theoretical VaR subadditivity in the tail arises because the coarseness of the empirical distribution can affect the apparent fatness of the tails. Finally, we document a dramatic reduction in the frequency of subadditivity violations, by using semi-parametric extreme value techniques for VaR estimation instead of <b>historical</b> <b>simulations...</b>|$|R

40|$|By {{coordinating}} {{the design and}} distribution of global climate model simulations of the past, current, and future climate, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) {{has become one of}} the foundational elements of climate science. However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1)  a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP <b>historical</b> <b>simulations</b> (1850 –near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2)  common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3)  an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP 6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP <b>historical</b> <b>simulations</b> to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP <b>historical</b> <b>simulations,</b> together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP 6 -Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP 6 will address three broad questions: – How does the Earth system respond to forcing? – What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases? – How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios? This CMIP 6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP 6 <b>historical</b> <b>simulations,</b> and includes a brief introduction to the 21  CMIP 6 -Endorsed MIPs. </p...|$|R

40|$|The period {{running from}} 1998 to 2012 has {{experienced}} a slower increase in global temperature at {{the surface of the}} Earth than the decades before. Several explanations have been proposed, ranging from internal variability of the climate system to a contribution of the natural external forcing. In this study, we use the IPSL-CM 5 A-LR climate model to test these different hypotheses. We consider <b>historical</b> <b>simulations,</b> including observed external forcing, in which nudging towards observed sea surface temperature has been applied to different regions of the ocean to phase the decadal variability of large-scale modes in the Atlantic and the Pacific to observations. We find that phasing the tropical Pacific is reducing the warming trend detected in <b>historical</b> <b>simulations</b> by a factor of two, but the remaining trend is still twice as large as the observed one. Combining the tropical Pacific phasing and the potential effect of recent eruptions allows us to fully reproduce the observed hiatus.

40|$|Because {{of a lack}} of observations, <b>historical</b> <b>simulations</b> of land surface {{conditions}} using land surface {{models are}} needed for studying variability and changes in the continental water cycle and for providing initial conditions for seasonal climate predictions. Atmospheric forcing datasets are also needed for land surface model development. The quality of atmospheric forcing data greatly affects the ability of land surface models to realistically simulate land surface conditions. Here a carefully constructed global forcing dataset for 1948 – 2004 with 3 -hourly and T 62 (� 1. 875 °) resolution is described, and <b>historical</b> <b>simulations</b> using the latest version of the Community Land Model version 3. 0 (CLM 3) are evaluated using available observations of streamflow, continental freshwater discharge, surface runoff, and soil moisture.
