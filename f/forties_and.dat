5|$|The Italian Army {{force in}} the area of Primosole Bridge came from the 213 Coastal Division {{commanded}} by General Carlo Gotti. Coastal divisions were second line divisions, usually formed from men in their <b>forties</b> <b>and</b> fifties, and were intended to perform labour or other second line duties. Recruited from the local population, their officers were mostly men who had retired but had then been called up again. Their morale was low, not least because of their second rate equipment and weapons. It had been intended to improve their armaments with equipment seized from the recently disbanded Vichy French army, but when the arms arrived in Sicily, many of them had been made unusable, and some had the wrong type of ammunition or no ammunition at all.|$|E
5|$|When the {{operation}} was still in its development stages, Armstrong and Colonel Roscoe C. Wilson were the leading candidates to command the group who was designated to drop the atomic bomb. Wilson was the Army Air Force project officer who provided liaison support to the Manhattan Project. Armstrong was an experienced combat veteran against German targets, {{but he was in}} his <b>forties</b> <b>and</b> had been severely injured in a fire in the summer of 1943. Wilson had no combat experience and was qualified primarily because of his engineering background and association with the project. Tibbets was considerably younger than both men and had experience in both staff and command duties in heavy bomber combat operations. He was already an experienced B-29 pilot, which made him an ideal candidate for the top-secret project.|$|E

25|$|Australia has {{excellent}} wind {{resources by}} world standards. The southern coastline {{lies in the}} roaring <b>forties</b> <b>and</b> hundreds of sites have average wind speeds above 8 or even 9m/s at 50m above ground (the hub height of a modern wind generator). The southwest of Western Australia, southern South Australia, western Victoria, northern Tasmania and elevated areas of New South Wales and Queensland have good wind resources. Several states engaged in systematic wind speed monitoring in the 1980s and 1990s, the results of which are publicly available. Australian wind farms produce on average capacity factors of 30–35%, making wind an attractive option. South Australia's large share (along with nearby Victoria) means most of Australia's wind power occurs around the same time.
