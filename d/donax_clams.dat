40|$|The {{behavior}} of the beach <b>clam,</b> <b>Donax</b> variabilis, resembles that of Donax semiqranosis in that it migrates {{up and down the}} beach with {{the rise and fall of}} the tide assisted by the wash of the surf. On the rising tide the acoustic shock of the breaking waves stimulates the bivalve to emerge from the sand in advance of the uprush so that the wash carries it up the beach. On the falling tide it ignores the acoustic stimulus and emerges into the back-wash to be carried down the beach. The reactions may be due to an intrinsic rhythm, changes in the wat,cr content of the sand, or a trigger-and-memory mechanism...|$|R

The objectives of this study are to analyze the variation of the spatial and temporal distribution of these species in the Western and Eastern Algarve, as well as to evaluate how the studied environmental parameters condition the abundance of the species concerned, in the following year, for the period before spawning and for the period after spawning + one month. Thus, annual distribution maps were elaborated for each species and region (Western and Eastern) and 16 linear models were applied to all four studied species, the two regions (Barlavento and Sotavento) and the study period (three months before spawning and spawning + one month The results of this study showed that the distribution and abundance of these species varies over the years, revealing different patterns of banks in terms of preference or absence for each species, and that all the analyzed environmental factors were significant in determining their abundance, the following year. The most significant environmental parameters affecting abundance were the rainfall and the chlorophyll a levels, especially in the Western area. In general, increasing chlorophyll levels were beneficial in contributing to the abundance of species either breeding adults or growing larvae, while the most abundant rainfall levels were positive for adult populations, and negative to the early life stages of these bivalves.

In this study, both taxa were sampled across their shared distributional area and specimens were indentified according to their respective morphological characteristics. Although width/height and height/length ratios revealed significant differences within sampling areas, the two morphotypes were frequently incongruent for taxonomically important morphometric parameters. In addition, they showed no significant mitochondrial genetic differentiation within or among populations and exhibited indistinguishable sperm ultrastructure.

40|$|Reproduction and {{recruitment}} {{of the surf}} <b>clam</b> <b>Donax</b> serra on two Namibian beaches were studied {{over a period of}} two years. Histological examination of the gonads indi-cated a discontinous annual reproductive cycle, related to monthly mean sea surface temperatures. The spawning season lasted from August/September until February but juveniles (2 - 6 mm anterior-posterior shell length) were only present for three months in the intertidal zone. The condition index indicates that the species spawns during autumn and summer, but histological validation is needed. The period when juveniles are abun-dant is decoupled from the spawning period and therefore cannot be predicted clearly, even if the spawning time is known.

Evidence for intensive use of coastal resources is limited primarily to an interval corresponding to the Middle Period elsewhere in southern California.

40|$|Growth {{rates of}} the Argentinean wedge <b>clam</b> <b>Donax</b> hanleyanus were {{estimated}} comparing two different methods in the intertidal of the exposed sandy beach Mar de las Pampas: (i) results of a relatively shortly (49 days) tagging-recapture experiment using the in situ fluorescent marking (IFM) method and subsequent size-increment analyses were compared with results from (ii) length-frequency distributions (LFD) analysis originating from a time consuming 25 month quantitative sampling. Residuals, derived from IFM method and LFD analysis, were of similar magnitude and distribution, indicating that both methods are equally appropriate to estimate growth of D. hanleyanus. Comparing overall growth performance indices (OGPs) of several Donax species from different climate areas it resulted that growth of temperate bivalves can be estimated well by carrying out a relatively short-time tagging-recapture experiment using IFM but it is recommended to use both, the IFM {{as well as the}} LFD method to determine growth of tropical bivalves. Furthermore, an in vitro suitability test of the three stains strontium chloride hexahydrate, alizarin red and calcein resulted that the latter is useful as non-lethal growth marker for D. hanleyanus, emitting a bright green fluorescence band under blue light...|$|R

In the laboratory, crabs and clams burrowed in sediments of varied coarseness and sortedness, and crabs also burrowed in the presence and absence of clams. Small crabs burrowed significantly more slowly in coarser sands, while sortedness did not affect crab burrowing. Clams burrowed significantly more slowly in coarse/sorted sand. Crabs burrowed significantly more slowly in the presence of clams. In the field, there was no significant correlation between sediment characteristics and crab number, while there was a significant negative correlation between sortedness and clam number. Numbers of crabs and clams exhibited no significant correlation. Differences between these species in absolute burrowing speeds may suggest that factors that slow burrowing prove limiting to slow-burrowing clams, but not to rapid-burrowing crabs...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn a {{resource}} management perspective, {{the understanding of}} the relative influence of the physical factors on species connectivity remains a major challenge and is also of great ecological and conservation biology interest. Despite the overfishing threat on the wedge <b>clam</b> <b>Donax</b> trunculus in Europe, relatively little information is known about its population genetic structure and connectivity and their consequences on conservation policies. We employed 16 microsatellite loci to characterise the genetic diversity and population structure of D. trunculus. A total of 514 samples from seven different localities along the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition, from the Atlantic (Gulf of Cádiz) to the northwestern Mediterranean were genotyped. The analysis of the population genetic structure displayed a clear distinction along the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition with different clusters in the Atlantic Ocean, the Alboran Sea and the northwestern Mediterranean. Consequently, we recommend that these three areas should be considered as different management units. We showed that all populations seem to be at high long-term risk of extinction {{with the exception of the}} protected Doñana National Park population which still seems to have evolutionary potential.

40|$|Ecological {{impacts of}} vehicle traffic are a {{significant}} environmental management issue on many sandy shores. Impacts usually focus on lethal effects of vehicles to organisms, but sub-lethal effects which could reduce the fitness of macrofauna populations are equally possible but unknown. Consequently, we measured changes in body condition and burrowing performance of the beach <b>clam</b> <b>Donax</b> deltoides subjected to vehicle traffic on sandy shores in eastern Australia. Body mass index of clams on beaches open to traffic was 16 % lower, but gonadosomatic index and relative valve thickness were not consistently linked to vehicle access to beaches. By contrast, off-road vehicles significantly impaired the burrowing performance of clams. After experimental exposure to ORV traffic (30 passes) and dislodgement from the sediment, the time taken for clams to re-bury into the sand doubled irrespective of the vehicle weight used. Because burrowing is such a critical function in the behavioural repertoire of sandy beach animals, the traffic-induced changes to organisms' performance {{found in this study}} may increase mortality by causing displacement to less favourable habitats by swash, and by intensifying the risk of predation and desiccation. When assessing the ecological impacts of vehicles on beach fauna, it is thus important to consider both lethal and sub-lethal effects.

40|$|Toxic "sulphide eruptions" {{sporadically}} {{occur in}} the highly productive inshore regions of the central Namibian Benguela upwelling system. The surf <b>clam</b> <b>Donax</b> serra (Röding, 1798) dominates the intertidal and upper subtidal of large exposed sandy beaches of southern Africa and its recruitment seems {{to be affected by}} sulphide events. The reaction of juvenile surf clams to low oxygen concentrations and sulphide occurrence (0. 1 mmol l- 1) was examined by in vitro exposure experiments in a gas-tight continuous flow system. After 2 h of hypoxic- and hypoxic-sulphidic conditions clams moved to the sediment surface, aiding their passive transport to areas with more favourable conditions. The clams showed a high sulphide detoxification capacity by oxidising the penetrating hydrogen sulphide to non-toxic thiosulphate. Moreover, juvenile D. serra switched to anaerobic energy production, indicated by the significant accumulation of succinate and, to some extent, alanine. Test animals were not able to reduce their energy requirements enough to withstand long periods of exposure, leading to a median survival time (LT 50) of 80 h under hypoxic sulphide incubation. In conclusion, natural "sulphide eruptions", especially those with a large spatial and temporal extension, have to be considered as an important factor for D. serra recruitment failures. Hydrogen sulphide is assumed to be a potential community structuring factor...|$|R
40|$|Surf <b>clams</b> <b>Donax</b> marincovichi {{inhabit the}} {{intertidal}} zone of high-energy sandy beaches from southern Peru to northern Chile. These bivalves are well adapted to their dynamic environment by {{being able to}} quickly borrow into the sediment, once the clams are washed out or undergo their tidal migration. This behaviour is necessary to escape predators. At reflected beaches north of Arica, the posterior end of the bivalves is commonly monospecifically fouled by hydrozoans (Clytia sp.), an epibiosis that has not been described before. This study investigated the effect of these epibionts on the burrowing performance of D. marincovichi. Burial time and burrowing intensity were obtained from 64 individuals, of which 32 were colonized by Clytia sp. and 32 were macroscopically clean. The burial times of the tested individuals did not correlate with shell length (25 to 33 mm). Burial times were not significantly different between fouled and clean D. marincovichi. However, significantly more fouled individuals completed burrowing, while more clean clams stopped just before the valves were covered with sediment. Burrowing time averaged at 25. 7 seconds and is therefore within the range of swash periods on Chinchorro beach (10 to 32 seconds) enabling the clams to hide from fish, crab and birds...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} the composition, structure and {{damage caused by}} mechanized dredges on discarded species from the wedge <b>clam</b> (<b>Donax</b> trunculus Linnaeus 1758) fisheries in the Alboran Sea. Discard samples were collected on board artisanal fishing vessels in 95 commercial hauls performed in Fuengirola and Caleta de Vélez between March 2013 and March 2014. The collected fauna was characterized according to their abundance and biomass, and considering their damage type by using a three-level scale (no damage, intermediate damage and severe damage) defined for the different faunal groups identified. Data was analysed for contrasting variations in the different areas and seasons. A total of 87 species were identified, including Paguridae and Annelida. Molluscs were the best represented faunal group, followed by decapod crustaceans and echinoderms. Other groups did not usually exceed 1 % of the total abundance and biomass such as fishes or sipunculids. Most discarded individuals displayed no damage after their capture, promoting therefore a high survival rate. Among the dominant taxa, echinoderms and crustaceans displayed the highest proportion of damaged individuals due to their fragile exoesqueletons, which make them to be highly vulnerable to the physical impact caused by mechanized dredges and the further processing on board.

40|$|Beach erosion – as a {{consequence}} of coastal development and sea level rise - can result in habitat fragmentation and habitat loss. Apart from the immediate implications of habitat loss for local beach communities, increased habitat fragmentation may have far-reaching consequences for meta-populations across large geographic scales by interrupting dispersal (and colonisation) patterns among beaches. This may ultimately lead to the extinction of a species. A better understanding of the connectivity among sandy beach species is necessary in order to gauge the resilience of populations and to predict the impact of habitat fragmentation on beach communities. Therefore, this study aims to assess the genetic connectivity of populations of a beach <b>clam,</b> <b>Donax</b> serra, across two biogeographic zones along the West and South coasts of South Africa. D. serra has a pelagic larval phase during its development which is expected to facilitate dispersal and hence connectivity among populations. Preliminary results from a limited number of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CO 1) sequences failed to reveal genetic differentiation among populations within and between of biogeographic regions in both species. These results may indeed indicate connectivity, either by recent separation or frequent dispersal. Analysis of additional samples and DNA regions (loci) may be required to unravel these two explanations, which may have considerable implications for the conservation status of sandy beaches...|$|R
40|$|After {{a massive}} {{mortality}} {{of the dominant}} species (the clam Mesodesma mactroides) occurred in 1995, changes in the intertidal community in sandy beaches of Argentina were monitored. Eight sampling stations were established in a 40 km open stretch and samples were taken every October each year up to 2001. Biomass, density, size frequency distribution and mean growth rates for the most abundant species were analyzed. During the mortality event, only the benthic stages of M. mactroides were affected, their total mean biomass diminishing from 1, 399 g to 2 g per running meter beach. Post-mortality recruitment was normal and the growth rates for the youngest cohorts {{were similar to those}} previously reported. After a two years’ lag, the wedge <b>clam</b> <b>Donax</b> hanleyanus replaced M. mactroides as the dominant species, increasing from 6. 0 g/m up to 24. 3 g/m. However, dominance replacement did not restore the productivity of the intertidal macrobenthic assemblage and, despite the increment of D. hanleyanus stocks, the community total biomass remained < 1 % of the pre-mortality levels. Since 1998 on, M. mactroides and D. hanleyanus showed several peaks in abundance. Disturbance, mainly due to non-regulated fisheries, has been delaying the community recovery. Taking into account the interactions among species and human activities, the present individual resourcebased management should be replaced by an integrated systembased management program including both conservation and tourism requirements...|$|R

The surf <b>clam</b> <b>Donax</b> hanleyanus, also known as berberecho, can be found along the Atlantic coast of South America, from Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) to northern Argentina. Along the coast of the Buenos Aires Province (Argentina), D. hanleyanus is abundant from San Clemente to Punta Mogotes, south of Mar del Plata. The beaches represent the southernmost habitats of a Donax species in the south western Atlantic. D. hanleyanus has a maximum adult size of 4. 2 mm and rarely lives for more than 4 yr. In order to study the gametogenic cycle, recruitment patterns, growth, production, and mortality, monthly sampling has been carried out in Santa Teresita, Villa Gesell and Faro Querandi. First results on growth based on cohort analysis are presented. For microgrowth analysis fluorescent stains (Alizarine, Calcein, Strontium chloride) are used.

The surf <b>clams</b> <b>Donax</b> obesulus and Mesodesma donacium are dominant and highly productive bivalves of exposed sandy beaches of the HCS. Existing knowledge indicates that El Niño (EN, warm phase of ENSO) and La Niña (LN, cold phase of ENSO) affect populations of both species in a different way, although understanding of the mechanisms underlying these effects is still lacking. The {{aim of this study}} was to test hypotheses attempting to explain field observations on the effect of strong EN or LN events by using controlled experimental conditions. Growth and mortality rates of both species were registered during a four-week experiment under EN temperature conditions, normal temperature conditions and LN temperature conditions. While D. obesulus exhibited reduced growth and higher mortality under LN conditions, M. donacium showed reduced growth and higher mortality under EN conditions. The results clearly indicate different temperature tolerance windows for each species, possibly reflecting the evolutionary origins of the Donacidae and Mesodesmatidae in regions with contrasting temperature regimes. These results provide experimental support for previous hypotheses suggesting that thermal tolerance is the driving factor behind observed changes in the species distributions of D. obesulus and M. donacium during the extreme phases of ENSO. 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Sandy beaches {{are prime}} {{recreational}} areas, but human use of beaches {{is not without}} ecological consequences. Driving of off-road vehicles on beaches for recreational pursuits is perhaps the physically most severe form of direct anthropogenic disturbance on sandy shores. Potential management and conservation interventions lack, however, data on how sensitive beach species are to vehicle impacts. We therefore experimentally quantified the link between beach traffic and lethal damages caused by vehicles to sandy shore invertebrates, using surf <b>clams</b> (<b>Donax</b> deltoides) as the biological response variable. Although clams had some tolerance against vehicles at low traffic volumes (5 vehicle passes), {{more than half of}} them were killed at higher traffic volumes (75 passes) in situations where cars traversed soft sand and turned across the beach face. Overall, both traffic volume and driver behaviour (i. e. straight vs. turning vehicle tracks) determined the incidence of direct crushing of clams under vehicles. Our data demonstrate that recreational use of ORVs is a source of mortality for beach invertebrates, but equally caution against extrapolating impact data from hard-shelled clams to potentially more sensitive soft-bodied species. Robust management interventions that seek to mitigate ecological damage from beach traffic will therefore require information on the functional relationship between the form, intensity and frequency of human disturbance and the biological responses for entire faunal assemblages on sandy shores...|$|R
40|$|Although beach {{nourishment}} is an increasingly popular means to remediate coastal erosion, no consensus exists regarding how long nourishment affects sandy beach intertidal invertebrates, {{key components of}} sandy beach ecosystems. We monitored the intertidal invertebrate community for fifteen months following a nourishment project at eight beaches across San Diego County. Each beach was split into nourished and control sections. Nearly all taxa showed major declines in abundance immediately following nourishment. Populations of Talitrid amphipods and the bean <b>clam</b> <b>Donax</b> gouldii recovered within one year, sooner than in previous studies. Populations of the mole crab Emerita analoga bloomed at four months after nourishment, and were more numerous on nourished portions of beaches at that time. Mole crab populations subsequently declined and no longer differed by treatment. The polychaete community, composed of Scolelepis spp. and several other numerically important taxa, showed a strong nourishment-induced reduction in abundance that persisted {{through the end of}} the study. The large negative effect of nourishment on polychaetes, coupled with their overall importance to the invertebrate community, resulted in a more than twofold reduction in overall invertebrate abundance on nourished beaches at 15 months. Such reductions may have far reaching consequences for sandy beach ecosystems, as community declines can reduce prey availability for shorebirds and fish. As this and other recent studies have revealed longer times for the recovery of intertidal invertebrates than previously observed, more cautious estimates regarding the magnitude and duration of impacts of {{beach nourishment}} should be applied to management practice...|$|R
40|$|The wedge <b>clam</b> <b>Donax</b> trunculus Linnaeus, 1758 {{is one of}} {{the most}} common bivalve {{molluscs}} inhabiting the sandy shores of the Mediterranean Sea and is considered an important commercial resource. In this study, we report the first molecular, morphological and histopathological descriptions of metacercariae from a trematode belonging to the genus Postmonorchis (Digenea: Monorchiidae) that infects D. trunculus in natural beds of the Italian Tyrrhenian coast (Campania, Lazio and Tuscany). Morphological analysis of the parasite revealed a combination of features that exist in the 3 previously identified species of Postmonorchis, viz. P. donacis, P. variabilis and P. orthopristis, with the addition of new, distinctive morphological characteristics. The pathogen exhibited a predilection for the gill; however, it was also present in the labial palp and mantle in addition to the gut, kidney epithelium and foot. The inflammatory response was characterised by either a focal or diffuse haemocyte infiltration followed by the formation of multiple, large multi-layered capsules associated with tissue destruction. The prevalence of the pathogen ranged from 75 to 100 %, while the infection intensity fluctuated among the study areas. Further studies regarding the life cycle of this parasite and the identification of other larval and adult stages and their respective hosts may confirm the identification of a new species of Postmonorchis that infects wedge clams in Mediterranean waters. The study of the parasite is completed by molecular analysis of the ITS 1 and ITS 2 rDNA sequences...|$|R
40|$|Rivers link oceans {{with the}} land, {{creating}} global hot spots of carbon processing in coastal seas. Coastlines {{around the world}} are dominated by sandy beaches, but beaches are unusual in that they are thought to rely almost exclusively on marine imports for food. No significant connections to terrestrial production having been demonstrated. By contrast, we isotopically traced carbon and nitrogen pathways leading to <b>clams</b> (<b>Donax</b> deltoides) on beaches. Clams from areas influenced by river plumes had significantly different isotope signatures (δ 13 C: − 18. 5 to − 20. 2 ‰; δ 15 N: 8. 3 – 10. 0 ‰) compared with clams remote from plumes (δ 13 C: − 17. 5 to − 19. 5 ‰; δ 15 N: 7. 6 – 8. 7 ‰), showing that terrestrial carbon and sewage, both delivered in river plumes, penetrate beach food webs. This is a novel mechanism of trophic subsidy in marine intertidal systems, linking the world’s largest shore ecosystem to continental watersheds. The same clams also carry pollution signatures of sewage discharged into rivers, demonstrating that coastal rivers connect ecosystems in unexpected ways and transfer contaminants across the land–ocean boundary. The links we demonstrate between terrigenous matter and the largest of all marine intertidal ecosystems are significant given the immense social, cultural, and economic values of beaches to humans and the predicted consequences of altered river discharge to coastal seas caused by global climate change...|$|R
40|$|Population structure, {{growth and}} {{production}} of the wedge <b>clam</b> <b>Donax</b> trunclus, inhabiting highly exposed sandy beaches of the littoral of Huelva (SW Spain) were investigated between January 2014 and July 2015. Growth rates were estimated comparing two different methods in the intertidal zones of beaches: (i) length-frequency distributions (LFD) analysis in two separated beaches (Doñana and Isla Canela) (ii) internal shell growth bands by thin shell cross sections (TS). For the TS methodology, valves were embedded in methyl-methacrylate, and sequential sections were grounded and polished to a thickness of 80 - 100 µm. This technique allowed the identification of annual ring depositions and the shell length-age keys were performed. In addition, several deformities (related to environmental stress or damages probably caused by fishing gears) as well as signs or recovery were observed. Both methodologies were equally appropriate to estimate growth of D. trunculus. Von Bertalanffy growth functions were established from LFD and TS using an asymptotic length (L∞) of 44. 8 mm and the growth constants (K) of 0. 5 (LF) and 0. 44 yr- 1 (TS). The intertidal biomass of D. trunculus ranged between 3. 03 - 3. 31 g ash-free dry mass (AFDW) m- 2 yr- 1. Individual production revealed the highest value at 27 mm length (0. 117 g AFDW m- 2 yr- 1) and annual production ranged between 3. 40 and 4. 91 g, resulting in renewal rate values (P/B) between 1. 03 y 1. 61. Differences between beaches in terms of annual production and P/B seem to be partially related to human activities. Versión del edito...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{increasing}} use of dredged {{materials as}} beach fill to protect coastal property and public beaches from storm damage, knowledge of how this practice affects sandy beach ecosystems remains poor. We coupled field monitoring of 2 successive beach disposal events with mesocosm experiments to assess mechanisms of ecological effects of fine sediment disposal. Macrobenthic sampling on Topsail Island, North Carolina, revealed that disposal of dredge spoils transformed beach grain sizes from medium to fine sand. Water sampling documented substantially elevated surf-zone turbidity during and occasionally after sediment deposition. When disposal occurred before spring invertebrate recruitment to the beach, it negatively influenced recruitment of the mole crab Emerita talpoida and the amphipod Parahaustorius longimerus. When disposal followed recruitment, it affected abundances of the bean <b>clam</b> <b>Donax</b> variabilis and 3 species of haustoriid amphipods negatively, and abundance of the spionid polychaete Scolelepis squamata positively. Effects lasted for the full warm season, and suppressions of invertebrate abundances were repeated across successive annual disposal events. In mesocosms, turbidity matching that induced in the field slowed growth of clams and modified habitat choices by predatory fishes. Hence, annual disposal of fine-grained dredge spoils on these sandy beaches maintained depressed abundances of 5 of 6 macroinvertebrate prey of shorebird and surf fish, without sustaining elevated volumes of beach sediments {{as long as a}} year. Implementation of disposal projects before the beginning of the seasonal recruitment of benthos resulted in fewer negative impacts on abundance than disposal projects conducted after the recruitment season, probably reflecting a more universal risk from burial and suffocation. 15 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Two {{distinct}} {{classes of}} repetitive sequences, interspersed mobile elements and satellite DNAs, shape eukaryotic genomes and drive their evolution. Short arrays of tandem repeats {{can also be}} present within non autonomous miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs). In the <b>clam</b> <b>Donax</b> trunculus, we characterized a composite, high copy number MITE,named DTC 84. It is omposed of a central region built of upto five core repeats linked to a microsatellite segment at one array end and flanked by sequences holding short inverted repeats. The modular composition and the conserved putative target site duplication sequence AA at the element termini are equivalent to the composition of several elements found in the cupped oyster Crassostrea virginica and in some insects. A unique featureof D. trunculus element is ordered array of core repeat variants,distinctive by diagnostic changes. Position of variants in the array is fixed, regardless of alterations in the core repeat copy number. Each repeat harbors a palindrome near the junction with the following unit, being a potential hotspot responsible for array length variations. As a consequence, variations in number of tandem repeats and variations in flanking sequences make every sequenced element unique. Core repeats may be thus considered as individual units within the MITE, with flanking sequences representing a “cassette” for internal repeats. Our results demonstrate that onset and spread of tandem repeats can be more intimately linked to processes of transposition than previously thought and suggest that genomes are shaped by interplays within a complex network of repetitive sequences...|$|R
40|$|RESUMENMicro-growth {{increments}} of the Argentinean surf <b>clam</b> <b>Donax</b> hanleyanus {{were measured}} at the exposed sandy beach Mar Azul. After marking the shells with the fluorescence marker Calcein, animals were allowed to grow in situ for 36 days. The majority of the marked specimens showed a distinct fluorescent band reflecting the calcein staining time and allowing for growth estimates. Palabras llaves: growth rate, fluorescent marking, Calcein, surf <b>clam,</b> <b>Donax</b> hanleyanusINTRODUCCIÓNGrowth rate {{is one of the}} basic parameters to describe population dynamics; from a fisheries point of view growth, as well as recruitment determines the sustainable yield, which can be exploited from a stock. Growth rates of bivalves have been well studied, since many species are important for the fishing industry. A variety of methods, including length-frequency analysis, tagging-recapture experiments and readings of shell growth rings were used. Among these, marking methods are efficient in estimating bivalve growth rates because they are inexpensive and relatively easy to apply. However, it is difficult to detect micro-growth increments in shells on a scale of less than tens of micrometers, since such increases must be measured with a vernier caliper or by optical microscopy. The aim of the current study is to determine in situ growth rates of the bivalve Donax hanleyanus inhabiting an Argentinean exposed sandy beach. MATERIAL Y MÉTODOS Fig. 1 : Left: Experimental cage (40 cm &# 61620; 40 cm &# 61620; 40 cm) bonded with a 1 -mm mesh, right: Installed cubes in the intertidal (Donax-belt) of the beach at Mar Azul (duration of experiment: 36 days). 260 specimens of the Argentinean surf <b>clam</b> <b>Donax</b> hanleyanus (anterior-posterior shell length [SL]: 13. 47 to 34. 95 mm) were collected alive at the exposed sandy beach Mar Azul, Province of Buenos Aires (37 ° 20 S, 57 ° 01 WO) in March 2006. To avoid high mortality rates during staining test bivalves were placed immediately in aerated tanks (circulating seawater). The water temperature was set to resemble the ambient temperature (17 - 20 °C). 195 specimens were stained with Calcein (Sigma, CAS 1461 - 15 - 0; 50 mg/l for 3 h) in a dark tank to prevent light degradation of the fluorescent chemical during the immersion period. Additionally a non-treated control group of 65 specimens was maintained in resembling tanks. The concentration and immersion period were chosen in accordance to our previous studies for marking Donax hanleyanus in controlled systems. After immersion test animals were reared in situ in three experimental cages (40 cm &# 61620; 40 cm &# 61620; 40 cm) bonded with a 1 -mm mesh for 36 days (Fig. 1). Every seventh day samples were taken. Test bivalves were scarified, empty shells were cleaned and dried at room temperature. For the detection of incorporated growth marks produced during the immersion in the Calcein solution, a transverse shell section was cut across the longest growth axis with a Buehler diamond saw (model Isomet) before embedding in Epoxicure resin (Araldit GY 257) and Endurecedor (HY 5083). Thereafter the cuts were successively polished on glass slides with different grades of SiC powder (125 - 68 - 30 - 12), and finally with 1 µm Al 2 O 3 suspension (Brot). Marks were detected by examination and photographing under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axio Imager Z 1) using blue light (460 to 490 nm, filter 9 : 488009 - 0000 - 000). The growth of Donax hanleyanus was determined with a micrometer measuring the distance (µm) between the staining mark and the growth edge. Absolute growth rate was measured as shell growth along time:absolute growth rate = where, SL 1 is the shell length before staining (t 1) and SL 2 the shell length {{at the end of the}} rearing period (t 2). RESULTADOS Y DISCUSIÓNThe distinct green fluorescence band of Calcein was visible in 81 % of the marked specimens. In 40 % of the spells growth increments were determined (Fig. 2). Maximal growth (362. 86 µm) was found in juvenile shells (SL = 15. 89 mm 18. 98 mm). Fig. 2 : Photomicrograph under blue light: transverse shell section of Donax hanleyanus, 14 days after (t 2) Calcein staining (t 1), the increment between t 1 and t 2 represents shell growth. CONCLUSIONESCalcein was found to be a useful growth marker for the surf <b>clam</b> <b>Donax</b> hanleyanus. Once incorporated into the shell, it emitted a bright green fluorescence under blue light, which was clearly distinguishable from natural autofluorescence. The distinct and narrow fluorescent band incorporated into the growing edge of the shells at the time of the Calcein staining could be successfully used as a distict starting point for the time interval and thus for very exact growth measurements (µm scale) related to time. For better insights of growth from the whole Donax hanleyanus population at Mar Azul it would be necessary to run the experiment for a longer time, which however proved to be very difficult due to the conditions of the exposed habitat. In addition, Calcein marking did not affect survivorship or growth of Donax hanleyanus and thus is considered to be a useful non-lethal marker for in situ growth experiments with clams.
