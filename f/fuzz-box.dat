[...] The circular nature of the song's lyrical themes is reinforced by its title and use of palindromes. In fact, the song is notable for featuring a word-by-word palindrome in one of the verses: [...] "'Son, I am able', she said, 'though you scare me.' 'Watch', said I. 'Beloved", I said, 'watch me scare you, though.' Said she, 'Able am I, son.'" [...] "She's Actual Size" [...] was written by Flansburgh after he contemplated the imagery of someone viewing a departing person in a mirror; he felt that the symbolism was a [...] "really succinct way of talking about leaving somebody behind". The band later expressed disappointment with the [...] "definitive" [...] version featured on this album, largely because the song continued to develop as the band played it live. Flansburgh called the album version [...] "timid" [...] and noted that [...] "later performance versions of [...] have so much more spirit than the recorded version."

[...] The song concludes with guitar-amplifier feedback, which Beck described in the Truth liner notes: [...] "Last note of song is my guitar being sick – well so would you if I smashed your guts for 2:28".

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 83, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Tiny Mix Tapes gave the album all five stars {{and said that}} [...] "Ultimately, what makes Good News so successful is that it retains the melancholy mood of past works, {{while at the same}} time adding depth and maturity." [...] Spin gave it an A and said it was [...] "Half expansive, burnished radio-rock, half swampy Delta hoodoo-hollerin' that reeks of Brock's Southern sojourn." [...] Filter gave it a score of 92% and said that it would soon be [...] "one of the best albums of 2004". NME gave it a score of nine out of ten and called it [...] "A real-life pop record. Well, not pop in the Girls Aloud sense of the word obviously, more in the drop-dead, <b>fuzz-box</b> brilliant 'Here Comes Your Man' sense." [...] Billboard gave it a favorable review and called it [...] "a daring yet accessible disc". The New York Times also gave it a favorable review and called it [...] "the best Modest Mouse album yet." [...] E! Online gave it a B+ and said that [...] "If there's a touchstone band for this album, it's Little Creatures-era Talking Heads cranking out songs that are joyously eccentric, celebratory and catchy." [...] Playlouder gave it four stars out of five and stated: [...] "It just feels that amidst his bare and heartfelt explorations of life and the old wooden box wherein we all end up, Brock has learned to dance, learned to allow himself a smile." [...] Mojo gave the album four stars out of five and said that [...] "Moments of simple, exultant joy are plentiful." [...] Q also gave it four stars out of five and said that the album consisted of [...] "45 bonkers minutes". Alternative Press likewise gave it four stars out of five and stated, [...] "If Good News... isn't the pillar-like masterpiece Modest Mouse fans have waited years for, it's proof that things haven't completely fallen apart." [...] Dusted gave it a favorable review and called it [...] "a more varied album than The Moon and Antarctica (which did seem to have only one speed), and with the return of original member Dan Gallucci, Brock appears to have revived the heavy lead guitar playing of their early work." [...] The A.V. Club also gave it a favorable review and stated, [...] "The songs still rely on Brock's echoing guitar patterns and Mobius-strip lyrics, delivered in the voice of a harried, hip-hop-inflected square-dance caller, but though the vehicle stays the same, the scenery outside the window changes considerably." ...|$|E

[...] "Spider" [...] is an eclectic song that was made when Flansburgh and Linnell were experimenting with a sampler. Linnell provided almost all of the voices, save for the line, [...] "must stop!"

The song was also originally intended to simply be titled [...] "The Guitar". Due to the legal ramifications of including the [...] "Lion Sleeps Tonight" [...] motif, Elektra required the band to add the name of the original song to the title. The song features Laura Cantrell on the chorus. [...] "Dinner Bell" [...] references Ivan Pavlov, and his experimentations in classical conditioning by using a dinner bell to cause his dog to salivate. According to Rolling Stone, [...] "Narrow Your Eyes" [...] is a [...] "touching breakup song that pays vocal tribute to The Beatles and The Four Seasons". Spin magazine called the song [...] "the most direct lyrically and simplest musically." [...] The opening line of [...] "See the Constellation"—described by Rolling Stone as [...] "a psychedelic/New Wave potion"—references railroad tracks and was inspired by a promotional photo of an Elektra recording artist who was resting on tracks. Flansburgh was struck by the [...] "contrary elements of the image", and he wondered, [...] "How relaxing can that kind of rest be unless you’ve given up on everything else?" ...|$|E
