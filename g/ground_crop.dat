40|$|Crop {{monitoring}} is {{an essential}} practice {{within the field of}} precision agriculture since it is based on observing, measuring and properly responding to inter- and intra-field variability. In particular, “on <b>ground</b> <b>crop</b> inspection” potentially allows early detection of certain crop problems or precision treatment to be carried out simultaneously with pest detection. “On ground monitoring” is also of great interest for woody crops. This paper explores the development of a low-cost crop monitoring system that can automatically create accurate 3 D models (clouds of coloured points) of woody crop rows. The system consists of a mobile platform that allows the easy acquisition of information in the field at an average speed of 3 km/h. The platform, among others, integrates an RGB-D sensor that provides RGB information as well as an array with the distances to the objects closest to the sensor. The RGB-D information plus the geographical positions of relevant points, such as the starting and the ending points of the row, allow the generation of a 3 D reconstruction of a woody crop row in which all the points of the cloud have a geographical location as well as the RGB colour values. The proposed approach for the automatic 3 D reconstruction is not limited {{by the size of the}} sampled space and includes a method for the removal of the drift that appears in the reconstruction of large crop rows...|$|E
40|$|Precision {{agriculture}} (PA) is an {{integration of}} a set of technologies aiming to improve productivity and profitability while sustaining the quality of the surrounding environment. It is a process that vastly relies on high-resolution information to enable greater precision in the management of inputs to production. This dissertation explored the usage of multispectral high resolution aerial imagery acquired by an unmanned aerial systems (UAS) platform to serve precision agriculture application. The UAS acquired imagery in the visual, near infrared and thermal infrared spectra with a resolution of less than a meter (15 - 60 cm). This research focused on developing two models to estimate cm-scale chlorophyll content and leaf nitrogen. To achieve the estimations a well-established machine learning algorithm (relevance vector machine) was used. The two models were trained on a dataset of in situ collected leaf chlorophyll and leaf nitrogen measurements, and the machine learning algorithm intelligently selected the most appropriate bands and indices for building regressions with the highest prediction accuracy. In addition, this research explored the usage of the high resolution imagery to estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) at 15 cm resolution. A comparison was also made between the high resolution ET and Landsat derived ET over two different crop cover (field crops and vineyards) to assess the advantages of UAS based high resolution ET. This research aimed to bridge the information embedded in the high resolution imagery with <b>ground</b> <b>crop</b> parameters to provide site specific information to assist farmers adopting precision agriculture. The framework of this dissertation consisted of three components that provide tools to support precision agriculture operational decisions.

40|$|Water is a {{fundamental}} issue for the current and future development of Tunisia. In fact, effective water management is essential for socio-economic development and for maintaining healthy ecosystems. The balance between available water resources {{and the need for}} water supply is growing from one year to another, and the deficit in water resources is rapidly becoming larger. To fill in this gap, a strategy based on water conservation and the search of unconventional resources, such as reuse of treated wastewater, has been adopted in Tunisia. Membrane technology can make a significant contribution since membrane filtration enables the production of high quality water. The paper summarizes results of the EC-funded PURATREAT project (Contract No. 015449) and aims to assess the efficiency of submerged membrane bioreactor (SMBR) technology in domestic wastewater treatment with a view to reuse.

The CAI remote sensing technique was tested over field plots of conventional and large biomass soybean (LBS) with known above <b>ground</b> <b>crop</b> residue biomass and surface coverage. New LBS types are being bred and tested at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC), Beltsville, Maryland, US, and can grow to heights of 1. 8 m and produce increased amounts of crop residue compared to conventional cultivars. The highest performing LBS line for these traits provided 2963 kg/ha more crop residue biomass and provided a maximum increase of 42 % more crop residue cover than the poorest performing conventional soybean. The comparison of LBS versus conventional soybean provided {{a wide range of}} soybean residue coverage for testing the CAI remote sensing algorithm. Spectrally derived CAI measures of crop residue were significantly associated with physical ground measurements of crop biomass at harvest and % cover after over wintering. Significant correlations were found between, the CAI and at harvest biomass (r 2 = 0. 66), between, the CAI and the line point transect measurement (r 2 = 0. 74), and between, CAI and the analysis of red-green-blue digital imagery (r 2 = 0. 74) for measuring crop residue cover.

Editors: Elaine Booth, Nigel Halford, Ian Sheild, Gail Taylor, David Turley, Tom VoigtSenescence impacts harvestable biomass yield and quality in Miscanthus. Very early autumn senescence shortens canopy duration reducing yield potential. When senescence {{is too late}} or slow, the crop does not ripen sufficiently before harvest, resulting in high moisture and nutrient content in harvested material that reduces biomass quality and affects crop sustainability. In this study, variation in senescence was monitored over 3 years in a trial of 244 Miscanthus genotypes planted in four replicate blocks. To test the hypothesis that through optimal timing of senescence {{it is possible to}} achieve high biomass accumulation and high crop quality, the progression of senescence was correlated to moisture content and interactions between senescence and yield studied in all years. To optimise crop yield and quality in different regions we need to better understand and identify the variation in the control of senescence. Senescence is a complex trait that is difficult to assay, particularly at the level of whole plant senescence necessary for bioenergy crops in which the whole above <b>ground</b> <b>crop</b> is harvested. We have tested high-throughput and quantitative analysis techniques that may contribute to improved senescence studies including detached leaf assays, digital image analysis and gene expression.

In this study, {{the use of}} an ultra light aircraft (ULA) equipped with broadband imaging sensors based on commercial digital cameras was investigated to characterize crop nitrogen status in cases of combined nitrogen and water stress. The acquisition system was composed of two Canon® EOS 400 D digital cameras: an original RGB camera measuring luminance in the Red, Green and Blue spectral bands, and a modified camera equipped with an external band-pass filter measuring luminance in the near-infrared. A 5 month experiment was conducted on a sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) trial consisting of three replicates. In each replicate, two sugarcane cultivars were grown with two levels of water input (rainfed/irrigated) and three levels of nitrogen (0, 65 and 130 kg/ha). Six ULA flights, coupled with <b>ground</b> <b>crop</b> measurements, took place during the experiment. For nitrogen status characterisation, three indices were tested from the closed canopy: the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), the green normalised difference vegetation index (GNDVI), and a broadband version of the simple ratio pigment index (hereafter referred to as the SRPIb), calculated from the ratio between blue and red bands of the digital camera. The indices were compared with two nitrogen crop variables: leaf nitrogen content (NL) and canopy nitrogen content (NC). SRPIb showed the best correlation (R 2 = 0. 7) with NL, independently of the water and the N treatment. NDVI and GNDVI were best correlated with NC values with correlation coefficients of 0. 7 and 0. 64 respectively, but the regression coefficients were dependent on the water and N treatment. These results showed that SRPIb could characterise the nitrogen status of sugarcane crop, even in the case of combined stress, and that such acquisition systems are promising for crop nitrogen monitoring.

Inorganic content in miscanthus was naturally reduced {{over the winter}} period from June (7. 36 wt. %) to February (2. 80 wt. %) due {{to a combination of}} senescence and natural leaching from rain water. September harvest produced similar mass balance yields, bio-oil quality and stability compared to February harvest (conventional harvest), but nitrogen content in above <b>ground</b> <b>crop</b> was to high (208 kg ha. - 1) to maintain sustainable crop production. Deionised water, 1. 00 % HCl and 0. 10 % Triton X- 100 washes were used to reduce inorganic content of miscanthus. Miscanthus washed with 0. 10 % Triton X- 100 resulted in the highest total liquid yield (76. 21 wt. %) and lowest char and reaction water yields (9. 77 wt. % and 8. 25 wt. % respectively). Concentrations of Triton X- 100 were varied to study further effects on mass balance yields and bio-oil stability. All concentrations of Triton X- 100 increased total liquid yield and decreased char and reaction water yields compared to untreated miscanthus. In terms of bio-oil stability 1. 00 % Triton X- 100 produced the most stable bio-oil with lowest viscosity index (2. 43) and lowest water content index (1. 01). Beech wood was impregnated with potassium and phosphorus resulting in lower liquid yields and increased char and gas yields due to their catalytic effect on fast pyrolysis product distribution. Increased potassium and phosphorus concentrations produced less stable bio-oils with viscosity and water content indexes increasing. Fast pyrolysis processing of phosphorus impregnated beech wood was problematic as the reactor bed material agglomerated into large clumps due to char formation within the reactor, affecting fluidisation and heat transfer...|$|E
40|$|Four field {{experiments}} over 2 years investigated whether wheat hybrids {{had higher}} nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) {{than their parents}} over a range of seed rates and different N regimes. There was little heterosis for total N in the above-ground biomass (NYt), but there was high-parent heterosis for grain N yields (NYg) {{in two of the}} hybrids, Hyno Esta and Hyno Rista, associated with greater nitrogen harvest index (NHI). Overall, the hybrids did not significantly increase the total dry matter produced per unit N in the above-ground crop (NUtE(t)), but did increase the grain dry matter per unit N in the above <b>ground</b> <b>crop</b> (NUtE(g)). The improvement in NUtE(g) was at the partial detriment of grain N concentration. Heterosis for grain NYg in Hyno Esta was lower at zero-N, suggesting that it did not achieve higher yields through more efficient capture or utilization of N. The greater NHI in Hyno Esta appeared to be facilitated by both greater N uptake, and remobilization of N from vegetative tissues, after anthesis. The response of N efficiency and uptake to seed rate was dependent on N supply and season. Where N fertilizer was applied, N uptake over time was slower at the lower seed rates, but where N was withheld N capture at the lowest seed rate soon approached the N capture of the higher seed rates. During grain filling, the rate of accumulation of N into the grain increased with seed rate and the duration of N accumulation decreased with seed rate. With N applied, N yields increased to all asymptote with seed rate, when N was withheld there was little response of N yields to seed rate. In 2002, N utilization efficiency (NUtE(t) and NUtE(g)) also increased asymptotically with seed rate, but in 2003 seed rate had little effect on N utilization efficiency. When nitrogen fertilizer had not been applied, NHI consistently decreased with increasing seed rate. The timing of N application made little difference to NUE, NY, or NUtE...|$|E

Journal of Agricultural Science, 142 (6), 639 - 657 Four field experiments over 2 years investigated whether wheat hybrids had higher nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) {{than their parents}} over a range of seed rates and different N regimes. There was little heterosis for total N in the above-ground biomass (NYt), but there was high-parent heterosis for grain N yields (NYg) {{in two of the}} hybrids, Hyno Esta and Hyno Rista, associated with greater nitrogen harvest index (NHI). Overall, the hybrids did not significantly increase the total dry matter produced per unit N in the above-ground crop (NUtEt), but did increase the grain dry matter per unit N in the above <b>ground</b> <b>crop</b> (NUtEg). The improvement in NUtEg was at the partial detriment of grain N concentration. Heterosis for grain NYg in Hyno Esta was lower at zero-N, suggesting that it did not achieve higher yields through more efficient capture or utilization of N. The greater NHI in Hyno Esta appeared to be facilitated by both greater N uptake, and remobilization of N from vegetative tissues, after anthesis. The response of N efficiency and uptake to seed rate was dependent on N supply and season. Where N fertilizer was applied, N uptake over time was slower at the lower seed rates, but where N was withheld N capture at the lowest seed rate soon approached the N capture of the higher seed rates. During grain filling, the rate of accumulation of N into the grain increased with seed rate and the duration of N accumulation decreased with seed rate. With N applied, N yields increased to an asymptote with seed rate, when N was withheld there was little response of N yields to seed rate. In 2002, N utilization efficiency (NUtEt and NUtEg) also increased asymptotically with seed rate, but in 2003 seed rate had little effect on N utilization efficiency. When nitrogen fertilizer had not been applied, NHI consistently decreased with increasing seed rate. The timing of N application made little difference to NUE, NY, or NUtE. Peer reviewe...|$|E
