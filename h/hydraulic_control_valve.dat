The typical digital valve system has 4 - 6 parallel connected on/off valves per control edge totaling 16 - 24 valves in the four-way valve configuration. The flow capacities of the parallel connected valves are set according to the powers of two such {{that it is possible to}} achieve 2 N different flow rates with N valves. An alternative approach is to use equally sized valves, which means that N parallel connected valves give only N+ 1 different flow rates.

40|$|Fatigue life {{prediction}} for {{machine components}} {{is a fundamental}} factor in the industrial world, and therefore several methods can be traced in technical literature to estimate life of notched components. The present paper correlates the classical stress-gradient approach, or support factor method, proposed by Siebel, Neuber and Petersen with the more recent theory of critical distance approach by Tanaka and Taylor. On one hand, the main asset of the support factor method is the punctual information about the stresses needed to estimate the effective stress, namely the maximum stress and stress gradient at the hot spot. By contrast, {{the theory of the}} critical distance needs the calculation of the stress distribution for a finite depth inside the material. The main drawback of the support factor method is that the material parameter * is available only for a limited series of materials. In order to overcome this limitation, the paper investigates the correlation between the material parameter * and the critical distance L by relying on a parametric stress function. The proposed correlation aims at giving a simple method for the industrial engineers, which often needs straightforward methods to tackle practical problems. A comparison between the two methods is carried out by considering three different benchmark geometries: a typical V-notched specimen, a vessel under internal pressure and a complex industrial <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> In the first two benchmarks, the effective stresses are analytically retrieved and compared using both methods while an elastic finite element analysis is performed for the last one. The close match of the fatigue life prediction between the methods supports the possibility to exploit the data available in literature for the critical distance in order to estimate the effective stresses with the support factor method...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to study the {{application}} of statistical methods of logistics process quality management at a large industrial enterprise and testing the theoretical studies. The analysis of the publications shows {{that a significant number}} of works by both Ukrainian and foreign authors has been dedicated to the research of quality management, while statistical methods of quality management have only been thoroughly analyzed by a small number of researchers, since these methods are referred to as classical, that is, those that are considered well-known and do not require special attention of modern scholars. In the authors’ opinion, the logistics process is a process of transformation and movement of material and accompanying flows by ensuring management freedom under the conditions of sequential interdependencies; standardization; synchronization; sharing information, and consistency of incentives, using innovative methods and models. In our study, we have shown that the management of logistics processes should use such statistical methods of quality management as descriptive statistics, experiment planning, hypotheses testing, measurement analysis, process opportunities analysis, regression analysis, reliability analysis, sampling, modeling, maps of statistical process control, specification of statistical tolerance, time series analysis. The proposed statistical methods of logistics processes quality management have been tested at the large industrial enterprise JSC "Dniepropetrovsk Aggregate Plant" that specializes in manufacturing hydraulic control valves.

The research described here identifies {{the limitations of}} existing robotic surgical platforms, which include the balance between {{the scale of the}} robot and its manipulability in terms of range of motion, load capacity, and tool capability, then develops a means of overcoming them by taking advantage of fluid power as an enabling technology with its inherent power density and controllability. The approach described here differs significantly from conventional surgical robots in that the robot is embedded within the surgical device itself, whereas in the conventional system, a general-purpose robot is used to manipulate various surgical tools. This is done in order to demonstrate that fluid power can be used advantageously for the design of embedded surgical robotic systems for minimally invasive surgery. To enable the design of a fluid powered surgical robot, it was first necessary to identify the design requirements for a robot of this nature as well as the considerations unique to this approach. To this end, a quantification of the necessary load capacity for natural orifice robots was conducted. Further, through {{a review of the literature}} in the fields of surgery and robotics, considerations of necessary workspace and limitations for the prevention of tissue damage were explored. The results of these analyses are presented. The technologies that comprise this novel surgical robotic system include a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> actuation units, and an enabling structure. The intended application of these technologies introduced numerous limitations and challenges to the design process. The most stringent of these limitations was that of overall size, due to the realities of patient anatomy, which prevented the use of commercially available hydraulic components. An assemblage of components to achieve the aforementioned design requirements is described including the design of a novel <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> to enable manipulation of three actuators using a single valve sized to fit within the working channel of a surgical endoscope. The advantage of the described approach is that the device enables greater miniaturization, improves cost effectiveness, and has better ease of mobility. The mobility and the relaxed requirements for operating room cleanliness can be potentially useful for mobile clinics, out-patient clinical settings, and on the battlefield. Being more cost effective and having a small overall size, the robotic assisted surgical devices can be widely deployed, even in rural or other less technology intensive environments. Through careful review of the literature and analytical evaluation of the various proposed concepts, it was possible to arrive at a design that meets the needs of modern surgical interventions while addressing the perceived limitations of existing surgical robotics. Through the efforts described in this dissertation, much new information was produced and developments resulted. The considerations of hydraulic power for surgical robots were evaluated and are applicable to other surgical tasks where hydraulic power may be used advantageously. A quantification of the load requirements for surgical robots performing abdominal procedures was produced which will provide a guide for other researchers developing surgical robots. These values are difficult to find in the literature and are a valuable resource for the field. An alternative, simplified model for predicting the behavior of continuum beams under load was developed to provide an inverse formulation for computing beam shape and end loads. This is useful as continuum beams are widely used for minimally invasive surgical manipulators as well as in a wide variety of other applications. Finally, a novel valve concept and two possible designs realizing this concept were developed. These valve designs facilitate control over the three actuators in an antagonistic arrangement. Further, the valve designs enable proportional control of the three actuators at a size scale not commercially available. In summary, the design of a novel hydraulic surgical manipulator as a summation of its parts has been performed. This design demonstrates the feasibility of the fluid power approach to embedded minimally invasive surgical robotics. The pursuit of this research has provided many unique challenges and the work presented here has addressed many of them, as well as laid the foundation for future developments in the application of hydraulic power to the growing field of surgical robotics for minimally invasive surgery...|$|E

In the near future this technology will be part of our society; sensing and actuating will be integrated in the environment of our houses by means of energy scavengers and wireless microsystems. These systems will be capable of monitoring the environment, communicating with people and among each other, actuating and supplying themselves independently. This concept is now possible thanks to the low power consumption of electronic devices and accurate design of energy scavengers to harvest energy from the surrounding environment. In principle, an autonomous device comprises three main subsystems: an energy scavenger, an energy storage unit and an operational stage. The energy scavenger is capable of harvesting very small amounts of energy from the surroundings and converting it into electrical energy. This energy can be stored in a small storage unit like a small battery or capacitor, thus being available as a power supply. The operational stage can perform a variety of tasks depending on the application. Inside its application range, this kind of system presents several advantages with respect to regular devices using external energy supplies. They can be simpler to apply as no external connections are needed; they are environmentally friendly and might be economically advantageous in the long term. Furthermore, their autonomous nature permits the application in locations where the local energy grid is not present and allows them to be ‘hidden' in the environment, being independent from interaction with humans. In the present paper an energy-harvesting system used to supply a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> of a heating system for a typical residential application is studied. The system converts the kinetic energy from the water flow inside the pipes of the heating system to power the energy scavenger.

The design phases comprise a trade-off analysis to define the most suitable hydraulic turbine and electric generator for the energy scavenger, and an optimization of the components to satisfy the systems specification...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis has {{investigated}} feasibility of effective well control in riserless drilling. An attempt was undertaken {{to design a}} realistic model of riserless well using advanced multiphase simulation tool and evaluate well control aspects as loss of primary well control, kick detection and well killing operations. One {{of the most significant}} findings in this study is that the well control procedures, which were specially developed for riserless and dual gradient application, do not work as expected. Modified Driller’s method and detection of shut-in drill pipe pressure after well is shut with HCV did not show desired results during simulations and must be revised. With unknown formation pressure it is impossible to circulate kick out of the well and pump the kill mud into the wellbore safely. And both Driller’s and Wait and Weight methods are not applicable. Therefore, well control operation in riserless drilling cannot be executed safely and in controlled manner using current technologies and procedures. Kick detection in riserless system is similar to conventional drilling. Almost all conventional kick detection methods are applicable in riserless drilling and allow detecting the kick effectively. The speed of the subsea pump also proved to be an effective method, which can be used in addition to conventional ones. However, {{it is not possible to}} perform a flow check and fluid fill-ups on trips to verify that kick is taken. It was also shown that the new equipment with complex control logic–hydraulic control valve is a very critical element of riserless drilling system. It is installed at the bottom of the drill string, which creates restriction for its maintenance. Effectiveness of the well control relies solely on HCV in the situation when the well must be shut-in. Therefore, the fact that HCV is the single point of failure is considerable disadvantage of the riserless system. The results of this study indicate that new well control procedures for riserless drilling require a high level of understanding of wellbore fluids influence on conditions in the well. Therefore, further development and utilization of model that was established in OLGA is important. It is also recommended that further research be undertaken in the following areas: Back-up emergency procedures for failure of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve,</b> subsea pump or both of them. Alternative well control procedures for the situation when the bit is not on the bottom. Research and development of the subsea pump so that new system would have high degree of operational flexibility to act not only as a pump but also as an analog of subsea choke during drilling, tripping and well control operations. Prior to development of the technical solutions and procedures it is highly recommended to enhance accuracy of the model and simulation software. OLGA multiphase phase flow simulator is intensively validated against field data for subsea multiphase flow lines, production riser systems and gas condensate pipelines. For the drilling systems, the extensive validation campaign against the field data is required to increase the confidence in the simulations results. This could be achieved through the cooperation between leading oil companies via JIPs. In addition operator training simulators could potentially help with such a complex and dynamic phenomena. The verified (for long vertical risers/pipes, with viscous mud) multiphase flow simulator could be integrated to the drilling simulator. This online system could potentially predict the behavior of the flow during the gas kick in the system during the drilling operation and will provide more time to react (as analogy to the OLGA/Hysys or Leda/K-Spice online integrated systems for the process/transport systems). </p...|$|E

40|$|The poppet <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} hydraulic components. The paper purpose is the evaluation of flow characteristics of poppet valve by means of a complete numerical analysis. The aim of this analysis is to evaluate the valve fluid dynamic performance, exploiting computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques, in order to give the reliable indications needed to define the valve design criteria and avoid expensive experimental tests. The numerical analysis was performed by using the commercial code of CFD, and the numerical results show the complete flow field inside the valve. Axisymmetric as well as three-dimensional valve model was considered and the simulation results also are verified with experimental results. The results have confirmed the good accuracy of the simplified CFD analysis based on 2 D axisymmetric valve model being more efficient than full 3 D approach and show this method as very useful to forecast flow characteristics of poppet <b>control</b> <b>valves.</b> <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> poppet <b>valve,</b> distribution of the velocity in layers of the fluid, computational grid in the modelled geometry, pressure distribution for axisymmetric and three-dimensional mode for different flow rate, fluid velocity distribution in valve metering section for axisymmetric and three-dimensional model for different flow rates, the example of streamlines, the comparison of flow characteristics are contained in the publication...|$|R
5000|$|Building on lessons learned, Lockheed Martin {{modified}} {{a commercial}} {{variant of the}} C-130 into a High Technology Test Bed (HTTB). This test aircraft set numerous short takeoff and landing performance records and significantly expanded the database for future derivatives of the C-130. [...] Modifications made to the HTTB included extended chord ailerons, a long chord rudder, fast-acting double-slotted trailing edge flaps, a high-camber wing leading edge extension, a larger dorsal fin and dorsal fins, the addition of three spoiler panels to each wing upper surface, a long-stroke main and nose landing gear system, and changes to the flight controls and a change from direct mechanical linkages assisted by hydraulic boost, to fully powered controls, in which the mechanical linkages from the flight station controls operated only the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> of the appropriate boost unit. The HTTB first flew on 19 June 1984, with civil registration of N130X. After demonstrating many new technologies, {{some of which were}} applied to the C-130J, the HTTB was lost in a fatal accident on 3 February 1993, at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, in Marietta, Georgia. [...] The crash was attributed to disengagement of the rudder fly-by-wire flight control system, resulting in a total loss of rudder control capability while conducting ground minimum control speed tests (Vmcg). The disengagement was a result of the inadequate design of the rudder's integrated actuator package by its manufacturer; the operator's insufficient system safety review failed to consider the consequences of the inadequate design to all operating regimes. A factor which contributed to the accident was the flight crew's lack of engineering flight test training.|$|R
