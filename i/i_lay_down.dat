2500|$|Spender {{argues that}} Praed [...] "made a {{virtue of being}} Australian", and gave her English {{audience}} novels that were [...] "racy, exotic and on the provocative fringes of polite Victorian fiction". In addition, Spender says, her writing was [...] "extraordinary" [...] at the time not only for her inclusion of Australian Aboriginal people as characters in her novels but for [...] "eloquently pleading their case for justice and dignity". In My Australian Girlhood, for example, she writes [...] "There has been no-one to write the Blacks' epic: not many have said words in their defence; and this is but a poor little plea <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> for my old friends".|$|E
2500|$|After {{destroying}} Hill's Ironworks {{and putting}} the rebel garrison there to flight, Huck convened a compulsory meeting of the remaining male residents of the New Acquisition District (mostly men too old to fight), and proclaimed that [...] "God almighty had become a rebel, but if there were twenty gods on that side, {{they would all be}} conquered." [...] Huck then stated that [...] "even if the rebels were as thick as trees, and Jesus Christ would come down and lead them, he would still defeat them," [...] following which he and his troopers confiscated all the men's horses. Actions like these quickly earned Huck the nickname [...] "the swearing captain" [...] and further angered the Presbyterian inhabitants of the backcountry. After witnessing Huck's tirade, one resident, Daniel Collins, told his wife, [...] "I have come home determined to take my gun and when I lay it down, <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> my life with it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{investigators}} {{began to}} use force on me, a sick 65-year-old man. I was made to lie face down and beaten on the soles of my feet and my spine with a rubber strap ... For the next few days, when those parts of my legs were covered with extensive internal hemorrhaging, they again beat the red-blue-and-yellow bruises with the strap and the pain was so intense that {{it felt as if}} boiling water was being poured on these sensitive areas. I howled and wept from the pain. I incriminated myself in the hope that by telling them lies I could end the ordeal. When <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> on the cot and fell asleep, after 18 hours of interrogation, in order to go back in an hour's time for more, I was woken up by my own groaning and because I was jerking about like a patient in the last stages of typhoid fever.|$|E
2500|$|The kin {{selection}} theory {{predicts that}} a gene may promote {{the recognition of}} kinship by historical continuity: a mammalian mother learns to identify her own offspring {{in the act of}} giving birth; a male preferentially directs resources to the offspring of mothers with whom he has copulated; the other chicks in a nest are siblings; and so on. The expected altruism between kin is calibrated by the value of p, also known as the coefficient of relatedness. For instance, an individual has a p = 1/2 in relation to his brother, and p = 1/8 to his cousin, so we would expect, ceteris paribus, greater altruism among brothers than among cousins. In this vein, geneticist J. B. S. Haldane famously joked, [...] "Would <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> my life to save my brother? No, but I would to save two brothers or eight cousins." [...] However, examining the human propensity for altruism, kin selection theory seems incapable of explaining cross-familiar, cross-racial and even cross-species acts of kindness.|$|E
2500|$|The classic Bible passage cited {{to prove}} a limited extent to the atonement is [...] in which Jesus uses {{shepherding}} practices {{as a metaphor for}} his relationship to his followers. A shepherd of those times would call his sheep from a mix of flocks, and his sheep would hear his voice and follow, while the sheep of other flocks would ignore any but their own shepherd's voice.. In that context, Jesus says, [...] "I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, ...and <b>I</b> <b>lay</b> <b>down</b> my life for the sheep," [...] and he tells the Pharisees that they [...] "do not believe because [...] are not part of [...] flock." [...] He continues, [...] "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand." [...] Since Calvinists (and many other Christians) believe that not all have eternal life with God, Calvinists conclude that there are only two possibilities: either Jesus was wrong in saying that he would lose none of his sheep (a conclusion they reject), or Jesus must not have laid down his life for everyone, as they understand [...] to imply. Formally, the Calvinist position can be expressed this way: ...|$|E
