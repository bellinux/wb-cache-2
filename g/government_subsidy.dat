5|$|In 2010, the Royal Opera House {{received}} a <b>government</b> <b>subsidy</b> {{of just over}} £27m, compared with a subsidy of £15m in 1998.

Compared with opera houses in mainland Europe, Covent Garden's public subsidy has remained low as a percentage of its income – typically 43%, compared with 60% for its counterpart in Munich.|$|E

This vessel was used to pilot ships across the Columbia Bar and thus improved maritime commerce for Portland. In 1870, he sold two blocks of land in downtown to the City of Portland, which would become the Plaza Blocks between Third and Fourth avenues at Main Street.|$|E

Residents’ demographics including age, educational attainment, income level, gender, and employment fields are analyzed based on a survey study in Wuhan, China.

5|$|With no <b>government</b> <b>subsidy</b> (s=0) the {{resulting}} equilibrium {{will be the}} standard Cournot outcome, {{as shown in the}} graph by the intersection of the best response functions. A subsidy however has the effect of shifting the domestic firm's best response function to the right. Because its output is subsidized, the domestic firm increases production. This in turn means that the foreign firm's best response is to cut output, although not proportionally (hence, the market price falls). In the new equilibrium domestic firm produces more and foreign firm produces less.|$|E
5|$|In August 1996, JAL Flight Academy was restructured, J-Air was {{separated}} and {{established as a}} wholly owned regional subsidiary airline of Japan Airlines on August 8. On November 1, the airline inaugurated its first flight from Hiroshima-Nishi Airport and was building up service on smaller-demand domestic routes, which larger aircraft could not serve economically. However, the local <b>government</b> <b>subsidy</b> was terminated {{at the end of}} the 2000 fiscal year and the airline was required to become self-sufficient. As part of its domestic marketing strategy, JAL found a niche market where the 100-plus-seats Boeing 737s were too large and frequent services were in demand, and began repositioning the airline. Fifty-seats Bombardier CRJ-200s were introduced and progressively replaced the five JS31s until completion in August 2003.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} year the RNLI raised £10,000, however by 1849, income had dropped to £354. Finding itself in {{financial}} difficulties, the RNLI accepted a <b>government</b> <b>subsidy</b> of £2,000, which rose in subsequent years. This lasted until 1869, when the RNLI ceased accepting subsidies – it had found that voluntary donations had fallen by more than the subsidies; in addition, the government's imposition of bureaucracy and regulations were detrimental to the service. It was the loss of 27 lifeboat crew of Southport and St Annes in 1886 that gave new impetus to fundraising and an 1889 appeal raised £10,000. The first Lifeboat Saturday was held in that year.|$|E

5|$|Just {{as there}} is a need for tax shifting, there is also a need for subsidy shifting. Subsidies are not an {{inherently}} bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through <b>government</b> <b>subsidy</b> schemes. The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30years, only one of the 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded. In terms of specific examples, the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes. And the combination of the federal tax deduction and a robust state tax deduction in California helped to create the modern wind power industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{early years}} of Rainilaiarivony's tenure as Prime Minister saw a {{reduction}} in French influence on the island, {{to the benefit of}} the British, whose alliance he strongly preferred. Contributing factors to the eclipse of French presence included a military defeat in 1870 and economic constraints that forced an end to French <b>government</b> <b>subsidy</b> of Catholic missions in Madagascar in 1871. He permitted foreigners to lease Malagasy land for 99 years but forbade its sale to non-citizens. The decision not to undertake the construction of roads connecting coastal towns to the capital was adopted as a deliberate strategy to protect Antananarivo from potential invasion by foreign armies.|$|E

All state nursing schools were eligible to participate in the program.

5|$|Mochitsura Hashimoto {{was born}} in 1909 in Kyoto, Japan the eighth of nine {{children}} and fifth son of a kannushi (Shinto priest). He attended Kyoto Third High School, a prestigious school, where he performed well. In his youth he was described as self-possessed and respectful. At the behest of his father, he applied for the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy. The family {{did not have a}} naval background, but Hashimoto's father struggled financially on a priest's <b>government</b> <b>subsidy</b> and he felt entering his son into the military would help to provide for them. One of Hashimoto's older brothers subsequently attended the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and was commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Army. Hashimoto {{graduated from high school in}} 1927 and was accepted into the Naval Academy. Leaving home for the first time, Hashimoto then attended the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima for four years, studying Japanese history, engineering, and naval tactics, as well as judo and other military athletics. He graduated and commissioned in 1931.|$|E
5|$|The game changes however if the {{government}} credibly promises to subsidize the domestic firm if it enters the market, as illustrated in Figure 2. Suppose {{the government}} promises a subsidy of twenty million, {{regardless of whether the}} foreign firm also enters or not. In that case, if the foreign firm enters the domestic firm will lose ten million from entry costs but will be more than compensated by the <b>government</b> <b>subsidy,</b> ending up with a net payoff of ten million. If the foreign firm does not enter of course, it is still profitable for the domestic firm to enter. As a result, regardless of the action of the foreign firm, the domestic firm's incentive is to enter the market. Anticipating this, the foreign firm will stay out of the market itself, since otherwise it would incur a loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{game with}} no <b>government</b> <b>subsidy</b> to the {{domestic}} firm is shown in Figure 1 on the left. If both firms enter, they each suffer a loss of 10 million dollars and if they both {{stay out of the}} market neither firm makes a profit or a loss. If only one firm enters however, that firm will realize a profit of 50 million dollars while the other firm will make nothing. The two Nash equilibria of this game (marked in purple) are the situations in which only one firm enters – but which firm, domestic or foreign, is indeterminate. In such a situation if the foreign firm has a slight initial advantage over the domestic firm (perhaps because it began product development earlier) the domestic firm will stay out and the foreign firm will enter.|$|E

40|$|<b>Government</b> <b>subsidies</b> {{have been}} a major concern in many {{developing}} countries and they could create major problems such as increase in smuggling, lack of interest in investment, etc. During the past couple of years, the government of Iran decided to eliminate subsidies in different goods such as energy prices and food. In this paper, we present a survey to measure the impacts of such deregulation on Iranian economic factors including inflation, unemployment, tuition fee, consumer consumption pattern and city transportation facilities. The survey distributes a questionnaire among 51 university students aged 20 to 26 in Likert scale. We have used Pearson correlation test to study the relationship between deregulation on <b>government</b> <b>subsidies</b> and other mentioned factors. The results of the survey indicate that there is a meaningful relationship between <b>government</b> <b>subsidies</b> and unemployment, transportation facilities, consumer consumption pattern.
