25|$|The {{game was}} {{broadcast}} in the United States by NBC with Dick Enberg handling the play-by-play duties and color commentator Merlin Olsen {{in the broadcast}} booth. This would be Olsen's final Super Bowl broadcast, as he was demoted the following season {{to make room for}} retiring 49ers head coach Bill Walsh. Bob Costas along with Gayle Gardner hosted the Super Bowl Live! pregame (2 hours), halftime, and postgame coverage with analysts Paul Maguire and then-Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula. Also assisting with NBC's coverage were pregame roving reporter Jim Gray (who was also working as a researcher for NBC Sports at the time) and Marv Albert, who interviewed Sam Wyche and Boomer Esiason after the game. Meanwhile, during NBC's pregame coverage, Ahmad Rashād and John Candy hosted the Diet Pepsi Talent Challenge at the Miami Seaquarium. Also, <b>Frank</b> <b>Deford</b> delivered a special segment profiling recently deceased Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney.|$|E
500|$|Although Chamberlain {{racked up}} some of the most {{impressive}} statistics in the history of Northern American professional sports, because he won [...] "just" [...] two NBA championships and lost seven out of eight playoff series against the Celtics teams of his on-court nemesis Bill Russell, Chamberlain was often called [...] "selfish" [...] and a [...] "loser". <b>Frank</b> <b>Deford</b> of ESPN said that Chamberlain was caught in a no-win situation: [...] "If you win, everybody says, 'Well, look at him, he's that big.' If you lose, everybody says, 'How could he lose, a guy that size?' [...] " [...] Chamberlain himself often said: [...] "Nobody roots for Goliath." [...] Like later superstar Shaquille O'Neal, Chamberlain was a target of criticism because of his poor free throw shooting, an abysmal [...]511 career average, with a low of [...]380 over the 1967–68 season. Countless suggestions were offered; he shot them underhanded, one-handed, two-handed, {{from the side of the}} circle, from well behind the line, and even banked in. Sixers coach Alex Hannum once suggested he shoot his famous fadeaway jumper as a free throw, but Chamberlain feared drawing more attention to his one great failing. [...] Despite his foul line woes, Chamberlain set the NBA record (28) for free throws made in a regular season game in his 1962 100-point game.|$|E
50|$|Fontana is {{also one}} of the last people to have ever played tennis with the legendary Bill Tilden. According to <b>Frank</b> <b>Deford’s</b> {{authoritative}} biography of Tilden, Big Bill Tilden, at pp. 273-74, in 1953 Fontana and Bedard, while on tennis scholarships at UCLA, were invited by Tilden to play tennis with him and Tilden’s protegé Art Anderson on Charlie Chaplin’s tennis court in Los Angeles in a mock-Davis Cup format of the U.S. versus Canada (the Canadians won both the first two singles and the doubles for an insurmountable 3-0 lead). Tilden, age 60 then, was found dead in his apartment a few days later on the eve of his proposed departure for the U.S. Pro Championships in Cleveland, Ohio.|$|R
500|$|The {{horse had}} {{nationwide}} appeal, but California Chrome's core fan base was {{centered in the}} Central Valley of California; the Sacramento television market ranked sixth in the nation for television viewership on Preakness day, and third in the nation on Belmont day. Prior to the Belmont, singer–songwriter team Templeton Thompson and Sam Gay wrote and recorded a song titled [...] "Bring it on Home, Chrome" [...] and a rap video featuring an elementary school children was released on YouTube. Even after his Belmont loss, Harris Farms fielded many calls daily from fans wanting to visit the horse while he had a break from racing in June and July 2014. In contrast to his admirers, California Chrome's image was somewhat diminished by the criticism that followed Coburn's post-Belmont comments. [...] Additional negative press occurred when Martin turned down an offer to bring California Chrome to parade in the paddock at Del Mar {{on the day of}} the Pacific Classic. [...] NPR's <b>Frank</b> <b>Deford</b> had little patience with the horse's story exemplifying the American dream; DeFord felt that the horse's victories would have little impact on the popularity of horse racing, which he viewed as [...] "a sport that is struggling against time and culture" [...] due to the prevalence of other types of gambling and the reduced impact of horses in the daily lives of most people.|$|E
500|$|Laguerre was {{promoted}} to managing editor of Sports Illustrated in May 1960, after four years as assistant managing editor. [...] His time at the magazine was instrumental in saving what was, when he took over, a financially insolvent publication. [...] He would serve as managing editor for fourteen years, leading the magazine {{for a total of}} 704 issues, then a record among Time, Inc. managing editors. [...] During his tenure, the circulation grew from 900,000 to 2,250,000 issues, and the advertising budget grew from $11.9 million to $72.2 million. [...] He altered {{the look and feel of}} the magazine, changing its focus from a lifestyle magazine that focused on leisure sports, to one that covered the major American team sports, at a time when television vastly altered the way in which such sports were covered. [...] As such, he kept Sports Illustrated at the head of the growth of interest in these sports. [...] He also placed a heavy emphasis on the use of color photography and late deadline, to keep the magazine up to date and visually appealing. [...] He hired and encouraged writers who were masters at prose, emphasizing writing over sportswriting, and the crop of writers he brought to the magazine, including <b>Frank</b> <b>Deford,</b> Dan Jenkins, Budd Schulberg, and Gil Rogin, helped change the way people wrote about sports.|$|E

2500|$|In 1988, for the 80th {{anniversary of}} the song and the 100th {{anniversary of the}} poem [...] "Casey at the Bat", Sports Illustrated writer <b>Frank</b> <b>Deford</b> {{constructed}} a fanciful story (later expanded to book form as Casey on the Loose) which posited Katie Casey as being {{the daughter of the}} famous slugger from the poem.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, during Gil Rogin's term as Managing Editor, the feature stories of <b>Frank</b> <b>Deford</b> became the magazine's anchor.

2500|$|Laguerre also instituted the {{innovative}} concept of one long {{story at the}} end of every issue, which he called the [...] "bonus piece". These well-written, in-depth articles helped to distinguish Sports Illustrated from other sports publications, and helped launch the careers of such legendary writers as <b>Frank</b> <b>Deford,</b> who in March 2010 wrote of Laguerre, [...] "He smoked cigars and drank Scotch and made the sun move across the heavens ... His genius as an editor was that he made you want to please him, but he wanted you to do that by writing in your own distinct way." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the March 17, 2003 {{edition of}} Sports Illustrated, {{columnist}} <b>Frank</b> <b>Deford</b> {{wrote an article}} entitled [...] "The Rise and Fall of Kirby Puckett", that documented Puckett's alleged indiscretions and attempted to contrast his private image with the much-revered public image he had previously maintained. Withdrawing from the team and friends, Puckett moved to Scottsdale, Arizona, along with his fiancee Jodi Olson and her son Cameron, {{in the winter of}} 2003. Those who did see him became concerned about Puckett's weight, with estimates putting it above 300 pounds. However, there was also optimism with news that Puckett planned to marry Olson in June 2005.|$|E
2500|$|The son of {{a wealthy}} leather {{manufacturer}} in Holland, Michigan, Cappon was a star athlete in both basketball and football, and was named to All-Western football teams in 1920, 1921, and 1922. [...] Before accepting a position at Princeton, Cappon was an assistant athletic director and basketball coach at Michigan from 1928 to 1938. [...] In 23 years at Princeton, Cappon won five Ivy League championships, and his trademark [...] "five-man weave" [...] offense became closely identified with the program. [...] He was a mentor at Princeton to a generation of student-athletes, including Butch van Breda Kolff, Bill Bradley and <b>Frank</b> <b>Deford.</b> [...] Cappon died at age 61 {{of a heart attack}} in the showers at Princeton's Dillon Gymnasium after a basketball practice session.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{great success}} as a player, McGraw is most remembered for his {{tremendous}} accomplishments as a manager. In his book The Old Ball Game, National Public Radio's <b>Frank</b> <b>Deford</b> calls McGraw [...] "the model for the classic American coach—a male version of the whore with a heart of gold—a tough, flinty so-and-so who was field-smart, a man's man his players came to love despite themselves." [...] McGraw took chances on players, signing some who had been discarded by other teams, often getting a few more good seasons out of them. Sometimes these risks paid off; other times, they did not work out quite so well. McGraw took a risk in signing famed athlete Jim Thorpe in 1913. Alas, Thorpe was a bust, not because he lacked athletic ability, but because [...] "he couldn't hit a ball that curved." [...] McGraw {{was one of the}} first to use a relief pitcher to save games. He pitched Claude Elliott in relief eight times in his ten appearances in 1905. Though saves were not an official statistic until 1969, Elliot was retroactively credited with six saves that season, a record at that time.|$|E
2500|$|Another famous Princeton alum {{who played}} for Cappon is Sports Illustrated writer <b>Frank</b> <b>Deford.</b> [...] Deford played on Princeton's {{practice}} squad while covering the varsity team for the campus newspaper. [...] Cappon once set Deford straight about his talents, telling him, [...] "Deford, you write basketball better than you play it." [...] Deford later wrote the following about Cappon:"In a profession in which men are renowned for their behavior during a basketball game, Cappy Cappon stood quite by himself among coaches. Until the game was over, the man never did anything but frown. There were degrees of frowning, of course, but his gamut of expression seldom ventured too far {{from that of a}} basic frown. A mournful frown, a disinterested frown, and if it was possible -- and it was -- a frown of satisfaction[...] [...] [...] And when something happened that there wasn't a frown to express completely, Cappy would cup his hands or rise to his feet and bellow the words: `What'rya doin' out there?' When the game was over, the frown would stay quite in place if Princeton lost. But if they won, he would finally smile just a bit, a smile that looked both modest and embarrassed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cook {{first set}} about his {{statistical}} baseball studies {{with the goal}} of proving that Ty Cobb, holder of the highest career batting average at [...]366, was better than Babe Ruth, the premier power hitter {{of the first half of}} the 20th century. Additionally Cook sought to understand strategical issues such as batting order and relief pitching, rather than accept the traditional strategies of baseball. Sports Illustrated writer <b>Frank</b> <b>Deford</b> learned of Cook's work and interviewed him for the lead story of a 1964 issue with the title [...] "Baseball is Played All Wrong". [...] Using tools of the time, such as a slide rule and a Friden STW mechanical calculator, Earnshaw Cook published the culmination of his work, Percentage Baseball (MIT Press), in 1964. Percentage Baseball was the first book of baseball statistics studies to gain national media attention. Though Cook received some support from Los Angeles Dodgers manager Walter Alston and Chicago White Sox owner Bill Veeck, most baseball executives and managers rejected Cook's mathematical approach and academic language. He was also criticized for lax mathematical models and inadequate numerical evidence by statisticians, such as George Lindsey (himself a baseball statistician), who advised that it be [...] "kept out of the sight of students of the theory of probability." [...] Modern author Michael Lewis describes Cook's prose as [...] "crafted to alienate [...] converts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Riley won {{the opening}} tip for Kentucky, but the referee ruled {{that he had}} {{illegally}} jumped too early and awarded possession to Texas Western. On the Wildcats' first possession, Lattin committed a foul on Riley while trying to block his shot. Twice {{in the early stages}} of the game, Lattin scored on slam dunks; this came after Haskins had told him to dunk as early as possible, in an attempt to [...] "send a message" [...] to Kentucky. Defensively, the Wildcats utilized a 1–3–1 zone; in response to their move, Haskins opted to start three guards in the Miners' lineup, as Worsley joined Hill and Artis. The teams were tied at 9–9 before a Miners free throw which put them in front. Hill had steals on two straight Wildcats possessions around midway through the first half, and scored following each turnover. The sequence gave the Miners a larger lead, and was described by writer <b>Frank</b> <b>Deford</b> as a turning point in the game. The second dunk by Lattin followed, which gave the Miners a 16–11 advantage. Writer Curry Kirkpatrick described the game as [...] "slow, tedious, [...] almost flat." [...] Future college basketball coach Gary Williams, who was in attendance, later complimented the Miners' ball movement, recalling that [...] "There were possessions where Texas Western passed it 10 times before taking a shot. At halftime, Texas Western led by three points, 31–28.|$|E
