40|$|On the European market {{there are}} several <b>fire</b> <b>retardant</b> <b>products</b> available, which reach class B in the European {{classification}} system. The producers promise their fire retardants are effective in reducing different reaction to fire parameters of wood such as the time to ignition, the mass loss rate, the heat release rate, the total heat release, the charring rate and the flame spread. This paper discusses the performance of <b>fire</b> <b>retardant</b> <b>products</b> as pressure impregnated wood, non-intumescence surface coatings and intumescence coatings on Norway spruce (Picea abies). The investigations are performed by using a cone calo- rimeter test according to ISO 5660. The thermal exposures of the investigations are 50 kW/m 2 and the standard IS 0 834 test curve. As result information about the heat release rate, the mass loss rate and the total heat release for duration of 900 seconds will be presented in this paper...|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{reaction}} to fire performance, timber products are commonly treated with fire retardants. At present, the level of development of such products with improved fire performance does not match the increasing use. Some of the fire retardant timber treatments are almost two millennia old, where alum and vinegar were first used. Little improvement has been observed since, with treatments exploiting the synergism between boron, phosphorus and nitrogen to promote char formation still prominent. The growing awareness of environmental issues and consumer safety of <b>fire</b> <b>retardant</b> <b>products,</b> however, means that the traditional use of boron and formaldehyde is likely to decline.|$|E
40|$|A round {{liquid jet}} in a gaseous {{crossflow}} (water in air) was observed over {{a range of}} conditions in order to investigate {{the relationship between the}} final width of the droplet cloud and the momentum ratio between the jet and the crossflow. The motivation for this work is as it relates to aerial fire suppression – that is, the use of aircraft to drop water or other <b>fire</b> <b>retardant</b> <b>products</b> onto vegetation to control and contain bushfires (forest fires). The experiment was set up on a frame extending from the side of a car. The reservoir, pump and controls were placed inside the car and the jet was fixed {{on the end of the}} frame to the side of the car. The water was coloured with dye, and as it was sprayed onto the ground it was filmed from above with a video camera fixed to a stationary frame. The various breakup phenomena were observed in this manner, and the droplets fell onto a sheet of paper, weighed down on the ground. Still images were taken of the drop pattern made visible on the paper, which were later processed in MatLab and a mean profile and full width half maximum were extracted. Previous work, collating real scale drop tests, had shown a strong dependence of the width, normalised by a characteristic nozzle diameter, on the momentum ratio be- tween the jet and the crossflow. A power law model was suggested, λ/ds = f 2 q 1 / 5 with different prefactors for free fall (or gravity fed) systems, f 2 = 27, and pressurised jet systems, f 2 = 58. Experiments were carried out over a range of momentum ratios with different noz- zle diameters, flow rates and car velocities, and a reasonably good agreement was found between the data and the proposed model. Finally, a new component to the model is suggested. However, time constraints meant that insufficient data were collected to develop a complete model.

40|$|This master {{thesis of}} the Building Technology track {{concerning}} fire resistance in a sun shading element {{as an alternative}} for fire retardant glazing was produced {{by the idea of}} Wiebe Schotanus from the Safety Region Haaglanden, who proposed the idea of combining sunshading and fire retardant properties as an alternative design solution for fire retardant glazing. The subject fire safety has grown in the past years into a major field of study, which is becoming more important in the building industry. This growth can also be seen in changes in the Dutch Building Decree the past years and in the built environment. Also in architecture there is an increasing demand for glass. Because of these factors also the demand for fire retardant glazing has increased as well as the demand for other <b>fire</b> <b>retardant</b> <b>products</b> and sunshading. In order to meet the increasing demand for glass in architecture, coupled with the increasing demand for sunshading elements and the growth of <b>fire</b> <b>retardant</b> <b>products,</b> in this thesis a concept design is developed for a fire retardant sun shading element as a design alternative for fire retardant glazing in public buildings. Herewith the chance on the development of fire by flash-over via the outside of a building should decrease and a cheaper design alternative for fire retardant glazing is proposed. To develop this concept research studies has been done to fire development, rules regarding fire safety in public buildings in Holland according to the Dutch Building Decree, fire retardant and sunshading products and materials in order to set a program of requirements. This is followed by simulations in the computer programs TRA and TRISCO in order to simulate the heat transfer during a fire in a room, especially in the glass and the façade and {{in order to determine the}} optimal distance between the window and the sunshading element on the inside. Also simulations are made with the same distances (75 and 100 mm) between the window and the element as the distances used in the measurements in order to compare them. With the use of prototypes made out of playing cards, wood and steel a couple of problems were solved and the mechanism to open and close the sunshading were tested. The mechanism of the fire retardant shading element closes automatically in case of fire, without the use of human effort or electricity. This is done by a wire which melts at high temperatures, with the result that the lamellae close automatically. At last measurements are performed in an oven of 700 degrees Celsius in order to test this self-closing mechanism and to measure the temperature rise in the glass in different situations, with the use of the fire retardant shading element and with two different glass thicknesses of 4 and 6 mm. The fire retardant shading element is tested at a distance of 75 and 100 mm from the window, in opened and closed situation and at last also a closed element with a fire retardant coating at a distance of 75 mm is tested. The system closed itself, because of the high temperatures and the melted wire, in around 10 seconds. One of the most important conclusions for as well the simulations as well as for the measurements is that how further away the element is from the heat source (fire), the less radiation it receives and how longer it takes for the glass pane to break. Also it takes longer for the glass to break when the 6 mm glass pane is used, because of the bigger mass. The fire retardant coating expanded because of the high temperatures from 1 mm to 20 - 30 mm, but did not have a remarkable effect on the time in which the glass pane broke. This probably because of the higher temperature in the oven in comparison to the other measurements and because of the conducted heat from the steel frame to the glass, because the frame was not coated or insulated and heat transfer from the steel to the glass was possible. But the fire retardant coating prevented the flames from raging to the outside of the element and the window when it was broken. So the element does prevent flash-over via the outside. Hereby a concept design is developed for a design alternative for fire retardant glazing. Naturally, this concept needs further study and more testing before it will become a definitive alternative design solution for fire retardant glazing.

40|$|Companies must {{constantly}} improve their technologies {{to survive the}} competitive battle in the nineteen nineties and beyond. This now holds more than ever for producers of engineering thermoplastics, who traditionally have enjoyed significantly higher margins than the commodity plastic producers. In today's competitive environment {{it is vital to}} be the high quality, low cost producer. At the same time products and processes need to become ''greener''. The drivers call for specific R&D approaches focused at cost and ecological improvements of processes and products. Examples are: (i) novel catalysis with fewer process steps, higher yields and selectivity for the production of monomers and polymers. (ii) solvent-free polymerisation processes, resulting in lower investment cost, lower operating cost and the lack of solvent traces in the final product (iii) design of polymer modifications, e. g. higher flow and/or higher heat copolymers such that products can be produced in existing equipment resulting in acceptable Return-on-Investment (ROI). Higher flow products are specifically needed for thin-wall designs to allow optimum use of the high mechanical properties of engineering thermoplastics, making shorter processing cycles possible during moulding and bringing less material in the environment. This paper reviews various routes to high flow technology, such as improving processing window, molecular engineering and blends. The pull for these technology developments come from optical data storage, thin wall bumper and super thin note bloc computer applications.

Experimental work for smoke produced by the combustion of certain wood samples was studied. Smoke generated from burning of natural wood, is considered as {{a major cause of}} death in furniture fires. The critical parameter for life safety in fires is the available time for escape, so the visual obscuration due to smoke release during fire is taken into consideration. The effect of smoke, produced by burning of wood, depends on the amount of smoke released in case of fire. The amount of smoke production, apparently, affects the time available for the occupants to escape.
