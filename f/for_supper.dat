5|$|At age ten, {{his older}} brother Burnie {{recalled}} that he stopped coming home <b>for</b> <b>supper,</b> instead hurrying down to the riverfront and slipping aboard {{one or another of}} the excursion boats to play the Calliope.

5|$|On 18 March 1889, Bury was arraigned for {{the murder}} of his wife; he entered a plea of not guilty. The trial was seen before Lord Young in the High Court of Justiciary on 28 March. Bury's defence team {{comprised}} solicitor David Tweedie and advocate William Hay; the prosecution was led by advocate depute Dugald or Dill McKechnie. The hearing lasted 13 hours. The prosecution witnesses included Ellen's sister Margaret Corney, William's former employer James Martin, the Burys' London landlady Elizabeth Haynes, William's drinking partner David Walker, Lieutenant Lamb and Drs Templeman and Littlejohn. After a break <b>for</b> <b>supper,</b> Hay presented the defence case, which was heavily dependent on Dr Lennox's testimony that Ellen had strangled herself. At 10:05p.m., Lord Young finished his summation, and the jury of 15 men retired to consider their verdict. After 25 minutes, the jury returned with a verdict of guilty with a recommendation for mercy. Lord Young asked the jury why they recommended mercy, and one of them replied that the medical evidence was contradictory, referring to Lennox's testimony. Dundee had a history of opposition to the death penalty, and the jury may have been trying to avoid passing a death sentence. Young told the jury to retire and reconsider their verdict until they were decided by the evidence one way or another. At 10:40p.m., they returned with a unanimous verdict of guilty. Lord Young passed the mandatory sentence for murder: death by hanging.|$|E

25|$|The Hall is the {{principal}} entrance to the house {{which would have been}} used by any eminent guests; entering the house by climbing the double staircase beneath the portico the guest immediately sees, through a gilded doorcase, a short enfilade through the staircase hall to the Octagon drawing room. While the hall in its use was not comparable with the Great Hall of earlier manor houses, it was still more than a mere entrance vestibule; in the 18th century, it was considered than any house of note required three principal reception rooms when entertaining: one for dancing, one <b>for</b> <b>supper</b> and one for cards. Thus, the hall, dining room and Octagon Drawing Room would fulfil those roles.|$|E
25|$|A typical episode {{features}} several vignettes of {{the everyday}} life of a couple, with the camera mostly centered on them. Often other characters are cropped, giving the programme its unique visual style. The couple receive friends <b>for</b> <b>supper,</b> go to the convenience store, or leave on a trip, and sometimes get on each other's nerves. Their quirks, and loving bickering, provide much of the program's humor. The graphic design style associated with the original Un gars, une fille, which consists of a palette of pastel blue and pink, and rough lines and scribbles, (seen in the transition graphics, see Original section), {{as well as a}} logo with simulated printing mistakes and smears, has been imitated by most of the other versions, with the notable exception of the American version. The character names are often those of the actors, as in the first version.|$|E

He was also granting lodging and material to various disadvantaged painters, as reported by his close friend Arghezi, and took {{a special interest in}} promoting the poetry of Ștefan Petică (as well as that of Arghezi himself). Arghezi claimed that such influence and moral support were also [...] "decisive" [...] in at least one other case, that of Luchian.

500|$|For {{the next}} week De Long's party {{struggled}} on, sometimes making barely a mile a day. Although they jettisoned more of their possessions on the way, De Long insisted on carrying his maps and journals. His entry for October 10 recorded that there was [...] "nothing <b>for</b> <b>supper</b> but a spoonful of glycerine". A few days later [...] Alexey, the group's principal hunter, shot a ptarmigan which provided soup. But Alexey was weakening, and on October 17 he died. On October 20, trapped by the weather and without supplies, the party came to a final halt. [...] Throughout the march De Long had written up his journal each day, but after October 20 his entries became intermittent, largely limited to terse statements of the dying and the dead. He noted the deaths of Kaak and Lee on October 21, Iverson on the 28th, Dressler on the 29th. His last entry, dated October 30, records the deaths of Boyd and Görtz and ends [...] "Mr Collins dying".|$|E
500|$|Thomas was a {{teenager}} when many of the poems for which he became famous were published: [...] "And death shall have no dominion", [...] "Before I Knocked" [...] and [...] "The Force That Through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower". [...] "And death shall have no dominion" [...] appeared in the New English Weekly in May 1933. When [...] "Light breaks where no sun shines" [...] appeared in The Listener in 1934, it {{caught the attention of}} three senior figures in literary London, T. S. Eliot, Geoffrey Grigson and Stephen Spender. They contacted Thomas and his first poetry volume, 18 Poems, was published in December 1934. 18 Poems was noted for its visionary qualities which led to critic Desmond Hawkins writing that the work was [...] "the sort of bomb that bursts no more than once in three years". The volume was critically acclaimed and won a contest run by the Sunday Referee, netting him new admirers from the London poetry world, including Edith Sitwell and Edwin Muir. The anthology was published by Fortune Press, in part a vanity publisher that did not pay its writers and expected them to buy a certain number of copies themselves. [...] A similar arrangement was used by other new authors including Philip Larkin. In September 1935, Thomas met Vernon Watkins, thus beginning a lifelong friendship. Thomas introduced Watkins, working at Lloyds Bank at the time, to his friends, now known as The Kardomah Gang. In those days, Thomas used to frequent the cinema on Mondays with Tom Warner who, like Watkins, had recently suffered a nervous breakdown. After these trips, Warner would bring Thomas back <b>for</b> <b>supper</b> with his aunt. On one occasion, when she served him a boiled egg, she had to cut its top off for him, as Thomas {{did not know how to}} do this. This was because his mother had done it for him all his life, an example of her coddling him. Years later, his wife Caitlin would still have to prepare his eggs for him. In December 1935 Thomas contributed the poem [...] "The Hand That Signed the Paper" [...] to Issue 18 of the bi-monthly New Verse. In 1936, his next collection Twenty-five Poems, published by J. M. Dent, also received much critical praise. In all, he wrote half his poems while living at Cwmdonkin Drive before moving to London. It was the time that Thomas's reputation for heavy drinking developed.|$|E

Hawthorne's wife Sophia entertained him while he waited for Hawthorne to come down <b>for</b> <b>supper,</b> and gave him copies of Twice-Told Tales and, for Malcolm, The Grandfather's Chair. Melville invited them to visit Arrowhead some time in the next two weeks, and when Sophia agreed, he looked forward to [...] "discussing the Universe with a bottle of brandy & cigars" [...] with Hawthorne. A few days later Sophia notified the Melvilles that Hawthorne could not stop working on his new book for more than one day, and Melville felt moved to repeat his invitation: [...] "Your bed is already made, & the wood marked for your fire." [...] Eventually Melville visited the Hawthornes again, and the next day Hawthorne surprised him by arriving at Arrowhead with his daughter Una. According to Robertson-Lorant, [...] "The handsome Hawthorne made quite an impression on the Melville women, especially Augusta, who was a great fan of his books." [...] They spent the day mostly [...] "smoking and talking metaphysics." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 8 November at 5:30 P.M., Carnegie left, {{saying to}} his {{geophysicist}} Chris Van Galder {{that he would}} return by 7:00 <b>for</b> <b>supper.</b> His bush pilot Todd Svarckopf warned him to not walk {{in the snow and}} play hockey in the airport's hangar for a substitution, but Carnegie disregarded the warning. He went for a walk in the snow, but did not return to the surveyor camp. At 7:30, a search was mounted. The camp's co-owner Mark Eikel drove out in a truck with Van Galder and Svarckopf searching for him. Carnegie's tracks were followed to the lake shore. On noticing wolf tracks on the shore, the three searchers went back for a rifle before continuing. Carnegie's body was found a little further on, but there were no wolves in sight at that time. Using a flashlight, the body was viewed from about 10m (32ft), many wolf tracks were visible around the body. [...] Later, when the body was being recovered, two sets of eyes were seen glowing in the dark close by. In addition, party searchers heard a wolf pack howling around the camp's vicinity.|$|E
