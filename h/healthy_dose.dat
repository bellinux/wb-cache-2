500|$|No Lifeguard on Duty {{received}} a favorable review from Publishers Weekly. The review concluded: [...] "The book is sometimes predictable and psychologically simplistic, but Dickinson {{comes across as}} a triumphant survivor. Her willingness to recognize her own flaws makes it easy to relate to her positive message and should inspire readers searching for solutions to career and personal conflicts." [...] The review praised the author's ability at being: [...] "honest enough to acknowledge the stimulating aspects of success and glamour, explaining why they lure insecure personalities and imprison them past the point of no return." [...] Women's Wear Daily reviewed the book and wrote: [...] "What keeps the book from becoming too tawdry is Dickinson's sense of humor. She applies a <b>healthy</b> <b>dose</b> to both her conquests and disaster's alike." ...|$|E
500|$|Alternative Press {{gave the}} album {{a rating of}} {{four out of five}} stars, while The New York Times called it [...] "...one of the most {{progressive}} rap projects to be released in the past year." [...] JazzTimes magazine lauded Thornton's lyrics, writing that his [...] "...oddball excursions reach near-cinematic levels." [...] Pitchfork reviewer James P. Wisdom wrote that [...] "Dr. Octagonecologyst is a fun-house ride in hell. All of the expected norms of G-rap have been violently removed and replaced with a <b>healthy</b> <b>dose</b> of creative perversity. It's throbbing and wet, snickering at your hangups, laughing at your conventions." [...] Additionally, Melody Maker called it [...] "bloody essential" [...] and stated [...] "While commercial American hip hop is slithering into an insipid mire of soulless, identikit swingbeat, Dr. Octagon has made an album swathed in character [...] Get yer prescription fixed." ...|$|E
500|$|X Japan's {{appearance}} {{was inspired by}} glam rock, Kiss, David Bowie, as well as traditional Japanese kabuki theatre, where it was customary for male actors to play female roles and dress like women. Visual kei artists still often employ feminine looks and garbs for their stage. According to Josephine Yun, [...] "like its music, X's look was individualistic. Square-shouldered Toshi donned leather and metal, looking like a character out of the anime Gundam. Taiji dolled up in perfect, pretty glam. Pata's sleepy, backseat demeanor and whiskey bottle became his trademark, as hide forever goaded the audience. And Yoshiki was a paradox all his own, bewtichingly effeminate one moment — and a full-force, wrist-breaking (literally) hurricane in concert the next." [...] Will Hodgkinson of The Times described X Japan as having, [...] "the grandiosity of Queen, the heavy-metal hysteria of Iron Maiden and the symphonic sophistication of classical music, all tied up with a <b>healthy</b> <b>dose</b> of melodrama." ...|$|E

500|$|Humor {{plays an}} {{important}} role in No One Lives Forever. As Hubbard explained, the game's intention is [...] "to make you laugh, but not at the expense of providing a broader, more satisfying emotional experience than a spoof generally allows, so that even if you don't chuckle once, you can still have plenty of fun playing the game. At heart, NOLF is an action/adventure/espionage game with a <b>healthy</b> <b>dose</b> of levity." [...] Humor is presented mainly via visual gags, overheard conversations, textual intelligence items, and cutscenes. The humor includes [...] "situational humor, and even a dash of absurdity and bathroom humor for good measure. Some of it is subtle, some of it isn't." [...] The name of UNITY, H.A.R.M., and other fictional organizations mentioned in the game follow the spy genre formula of using contrived acronyms for organizations (see List of fictional espionage organizations). What H.A.R.M. actually stands for is never revealed, and speculation about its true meaning is used as a running gag in the game and its sequel.|$|E
500|$|Chris Beveridge from Mania.com {{praised the}} Cobra the Animation anime series and its visual design, {{comparing}} to The Psychogun ones, {{but said it}} is not for those who are unaware the original series. He said the anime has [...] "a <b>healthy</b> <b>dose</b> of action, the kind of sexuality that's a trademark of the series ... as well as a good bit of silly fun". In the second episode review, Beveridge said it [...] "seems to be following much the same kind of pace and structure" [...] as the OVAs. Its animation was compared with the Darkside Blues; [...] ANN's Erin Finnegan said it was a [...] "gritty" [...] animation, but that from episode five, the animation quality looks more modern and much less gritty. Beveridge said the anime's idea is simple, but added it is [...] "also not a show you see often since it doesn't center around teenagers, schools or the harem concept". He said it is not [...] "a great show", but that [...] "it gives us something different than the usual"the reason it is [...] "enjoyable".|$|E
500|$|UPN {{executives}} had {{pitched the}} series as following [...] "young doctors in peril at a haunted old Boston Hospital" [...] who {{must contend with}} [...] "a <b>healthy</b> <b>dose</b> of terrifying paranormal occurrences and gripping medical emergencies". In the pilot episode, Dr. Mitchell Grace (Grayson McCouch) begins working at the hospital immediately after graduating from medical school. He had specifically chosen the All Souls medical program, refusing offers from the Mayo Clinic and the Yale–New Haven Hospital, due to his personal connection with the hospital. While working as a janitor in the hospital, Grace's father died in 1978 after contracting a mysterious illness. Grace serves as the show's lead character, and functions as a detective {{as well as a}} doctor while trying to understand the inner workings of All Souls. As he works, Grace encounters both good and evil ghosts, and discovers medical experiments are being conducted under the guidance of the board of directors. Some spirits include [...] "a mad scientist and his Igor-like errand boy," [...] and a woman dressed in 19th century fashion pushing a baby carriage through the halls. Grace is haunted by visions of his father, and he is somehow connected with the ghost Lazarus and Civil War doctors. Dr. Dante Ambrosious (Jean LeClerc), the chair of the facility's board, is shown to have made deals with the evil spirits.|$|E

2500|$|English {{rock band}} Led Zeppelin {{recorded}} [...] "You Shook Me" [...] for their 1969 debut album Led Zeppelin. [...] AllMusic critic Bill Janovitz {{describes it as}} [...] "a heavy, pummeling bit of post-psychedelic blues-rock, with <b>healthy</b> <b>doses</b> of vocal histrionics from Robert Plant and guitar fireworks from Jimmy Page". At nearly {{six and a half}} minutes, it is considerably longer than the Muddy Waters or Jeff Beck recordings.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to detecting deception in subjects they interview, Lightman {{and his team}} also use various interviewing and interrogation tactics to elicit useful information. Rather than by force, they use careful lines of questioning, provocative statements, theatrics and <b>healthy</b> <b>doses</b> of deception on their own part. In the show's pilot episode, Lightman is speaking {{to a man who}} is refusing to speak at all, and is able to discern vital information by talking to him and gauging his reaction to each statement. This approach is also taken in several other episodes (e.g., [...] "Do No Harm").|$|R
500|$|Jeff Swindoll of Monsters and Critics.com {{repeated}} many of {{the same}} sentiments in his review of the film. He hated the characters within the first five minutes of the film and found himself wishing that the film had shown more of the bear just walking in the woods rather than the characters talking with one another between the attacks. Matt Gamble of UGO Entertainment was excited by the film's cover, but was also quickly disappointed by [...] "insipid dialog" [...] amongst the characters and their continuously calling each other [...] "dude." [...] The characters actually asking what a bear was doing in the Canadian wilderness, where bears are plentiful, amused him, though he notes that it was probably not the intended reaction for the scene. His final rating of the film was an [...] "F." [...] DVD Verdict's David Johnson also questioned why the bear and actors are never seen on screen together. He derided the scenes in which the bear would make a swiping motion, and the scene would cut to show a character flying through the air: [...] "I don't know how the bear mastered the art of jujitsu in the wild, but it comes in handy when four teenagers snuff your cub and they need a <b>healthy</b> <b>dose</b> of comeuppance." [...] He also wondered at the lack of fake blood or props being used during attacks rather than [...] "ridiculous blood splatter computer graphics tossed on the screen." [...] Multiple critics noted that the film introduced two potentially interesting subplots that ended up being pointless as the film never explored either, and they all agreed that the film had excellent picture quality.|$|E

[...] Chad Presley from Blogcritics felt that, [...] "There's a <b>healthy</b> <b>dose</b> of nostalgia involved in watching these videos for anyone who grew up during the 1980s in particular. [...] The video quality is a mixed bag. Most of the visual problems crop up during the earlier clips, which were photographed on much more primitive equipment. [...] All things considered, especially when viewed on a Blu-ray player and hi-def TV, {{this is a pretty}} rough looking set. Even some of the later videos have an excess of visual noise and are lacking in sharpness." [...] Ian Sturges from Daily Mirror commented, [...] "Celebration is a journey [...] from coquettish wannabe to pop goddess to institution. [...] The videos parallel this transformation from her innocent cavorting on a Venetian gondola for 'Like a Virgin' to the determinedly X-rated couplings of 'Justify My Love' and 'Erotica', both of which were banned. Monica Herrera from Billboard was not impressed with the collection and was disappointed with the [...] "dull quality of the videos. The collection is a probable shame in Madonna's catalogue, but a great one for her fans."

500|$|Jab Tak Hai Jaan {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics overseas. Priya Joshi of the website Digital Spy gave it 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "The film is invested with a <b>healthy</b> <b>dose</b> of Shah Rukh, {{the very heart}} and saans of Yash Chopra and the message which he lived and breathed through his films: that love is eternal." [...] Simon Foster of Australia's Special Broadcasting Service also gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, calling it [...] "a grand cinematic work boasting all {{the pros and cons}} of the genre." [...] He observed: [...] "Chopra fans will not hear complaints that the great producer-director had become mired in a rut, or that his films are rote melodramas reliant on boisterous music (here, a typically string-heavy work from the omnipresent A.R. Rahman) and over-active camerawork. One could argue that it's their very vivid cinematic nature that makes them particularly noteworthy, even when the dialogue (at times, awful) and plotting (rarely based in logical realism) can test one's patience." [...] Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times wrote: [...] "The film has a freshness that would never lead one to think it was directed by an 80-year-old while at the same time it has a sureness of tone, a certainty about itself even at its most audacious, that only comes from the hand of a seasoned master...Jab Tak Hai Jaan serves as a fitting tribute to the career of Chopra." [...] Lisa Tsering of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "Director-producer Yash Chopra's film, his final project before he died, delivers not only the romance and human touch, but also reflects a modern sensibility." [...] Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Even though the film drags, the magic of Bollywood is that this story's muddle of twists only clarifies the urgency behind the undying desires of all concerned parties." [...] Mazhar Farooqui of Dubai's the Gulf News wrote: [...] "Despite its inherent flaws, JTHJ comes across as a beguiling romantic film that takes you on a roller coaster ride of high emotions set amidst picture postcard locales but more than anyone the movie belongs to Chopra. In his swan song, the celebrated director once again proved why his legacy will be hard to match." ...|$|E

It’s deeply engaging and impressive in its range, {{and for the most}} part it manages to keep its many narrative balls spinning gracefully.

IGN gave it a 9 out of 10 and stated, [...] "It is an album full of important messages, with none greater than our inability and unwillingness to see the signs of our impending doom over a blend of chunky, thrusting riffs and nimble, wiry guitar of purposive apocalyptic [...] "Endgame". The melodic bliss hidden in the hammering riffs on powder keg [...] "Satellite" [...] and chugging [...] "This Is Letting Go" [...] is what makes this a tough album to resist for even those not accustomed to the staggering punk package it wraps it all up in." [...] Blare Magazine gave it a three-and-a-half out of five stars and stated, [...] "Letting past busts fade into nothing, the Chicago punk rockers have rediscovered their edge.

Even when Scott Hutchison sings “Find God just to lose it again” on “The Loneliness and the Scream,” there’s a warmth in the music that makes him sound liberated instead of isolated."

There's no gory violence or swearing, of course, but there sure is a film buff's parade of great movie moments." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars calling the film [...] "some kind of a miracle: An animated comedy for smart moviegoers, wonderfully made, great to look at, wickedly satirical....

In JazzTimes Bill Milkowski wrote [...] "Carter's Layin' in the Cut is more about bluster than nuance ... he explores the outer fringes of funk with some freestyle originals that combine elements of Maceo Parker ("Layin' in the Cut") and Fela Kuti ("Motown Mash"), with <b>healthy</b> <b>doses</b> of tenor and bari overblowing {{and the kind of}} savage, aggressively out guitar work usually associated with New York's renegade downtown scene". On All About Jazz Mark Corroto noted [...] "Layin’ doesn’t opt to cross boundaries as much as it plays itself out as a jazz/funk bar band ... The powerful all-electric lineup matches up nicely with Carter’s huge sound. In contract to Chasin’ there’s nothing implied about the groove here. The funk is up front". Critic Robert Christgau rated the album an [...] "A" [...] saying it is [...] "just a way for him to make another record without his touring band, write heads while nobody's looking, pay respects to a strain straighter coreligionists disdain, and prove he can rock a little, quite possibly while finishing the crossword.
