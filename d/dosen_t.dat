This {{research is}} done on may up to August 2011, in agricultural faculty of Tidar University of Magelang with the height 300 m dpl, latosol type of soil and PH 5, 6. This research used facto rial design that was composed by randomly (RAKL) with two factor treatment s and they were repented factor three times. The fist factor was the age of the seed after crop (U) : / 0 days, 20 days and 30 days, the second factor was with the number of seed per meter : 75 g, 100 g and 1 5 g. for the further examination, I used orthogonal and poly nominal test with double distance test of Dunca 12. The results of this research show that the older the age of the heavy of the fresh bud, and the heavy of the dry bud,·and also it-doesn´t influence really to the heavy of fresh root and the heavy of the dry root. the number of the seed for meter that will increase "it will also increase the heavy of the fresh bud and the heavy of the dry bud. It <b>dosen.</b> <b>t</b> influence on the heavy of the fresh root and the heavy of dry root. The highest of the heavy fresh. bud and dry root is {{can be found in the}} seed after 20 days of crop that was spread with the total number 75 red 100 g /m.
