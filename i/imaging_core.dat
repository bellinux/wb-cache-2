50|$|A biopsy is a {{small piece}} of tissue removed {{primarily}} for the purposes of surgical pathology analysis, most often in order to render a definitive diagnosis. Types of biopsies include core biopsies, which are obtained through the use of large-bore needles, sometimes under the guidance of radiological techniques such as ultrasound, CT scan, or magnetic resonance <b>imaging.</b> <b>Core</b> biopsies, which preserve tissue architecture, {{should not be confused with}} fine needle aspiration specimens, which are analyzed using cytopathology techniques. Incisional biopsies are obtained through diagnostic surgical procedures that remove part of a suspicious lesion, whereas excisional biopsies remove the entire lesion, and are similar to therapeutic surgical resections. Excisional biopsies of skin lesions and gastrointestinal polyps are very common. The pathologist's interpretation of a biopsy is critical to establishing the diagnosis of a benign or malignant tumor, and can differentiate between different types and grades of cancer, as well as determining the activity of specific molecular pathways in the tumor. This information is important for estimating the patient's prognosis and for choosing the best treatment to administer. Biopsies are also used to diagnose diseases other than cancer, including inflammatory, infectious, or idiopathic diseases of the skin and gastrointestinal tract, to name only a few.|$|E

40|$|An x-ray scanner was {{designed}} and fabricated at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to provide high speed acquisition of x-ray images of sediment cores collected on the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 204 : Drilling Gas Hydrates On Hydrate Ridge, Cascadia Continental Margin.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Intravascular {{ultrasound}} imaging (IVUS) {{is limited by}} the size of the imaging catheter. To facilitate imaging before and during interventions, a 30 -MHz ultrasonic imaging device was developed that is the same dimension as a 0. 018 -inch guide wire. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical feasibility of this device. METHODS AND RESULTS: The <b>imaging</b> <b>core</b> was tested in 8 patients with the use of a monorail guiding sheath that was advanced through a 7 F catheter. In addition, after coronary interventions, the standard guide wire was removed, the <b>imaging</b> <b>core</b> was placed inside a compatible balloon, and imaging was performed. In 4 patients, imaging was also performed with a standard 3. 2 F IVUS catheter. The lumen-plaque interface and the media-plaque interface were clearly visualized in all patients. There was no detectable loss in image quality between the new imaging device and the larger IVUS catheter, and measurements of lumen cross-sectional area were not statistically different. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in manufacturing technology have permitted the development of a mechanically rotating ultrasound <b>imaging</b> <b>core</b> 0. 018 inches in diameter.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the CHIANTI cruise was to collect geophysical marine data to determine the deep crustal structure and plate geometry across the subduction system of the Ionian and Tyrrhenian Seas, from the frontal wedge to the arc and back-arc. The goal is to study the processes that operated during the subduction of the Ionian slab of oceanic crust under Calabria, which {{lead to the development}} of the Aeolian volcanic arc, and the subsequent opening of the Tyrrhenian basin, and are responsible of the geological hazards that threaten the region. The CHIANTI cruise onboard the Spanish R/V BO Sarmiento de Gamboa started in Barcelona (Spain) on July 12, and finished in Catania (Italy), on August 28, 2015. It consisted of four legs devoted to acquisition of data with different seismic/acoustic techniques in the Tyrrhenian and Ionian Seas. Leg 1 and 2 were focused on the acquisition of deep penetrating Wide-Angle Reflection and Refraction Seismic (WAS) data, Leg 3 on Multichannel Seismic (MCS) Reflection data and finally Leg 4 was devoted to sidescan <b>imaging,</b> <b>coring</b> and single channel seismic acquisition. During the entire cruise, complementary acoustic data (i. e. multibeam bathymetry and sub-bottom profiler) were acquired simultaneously. In this presentation we focus on the seafloor mapping and processed multichannel seismic reflection grid collected on the IONIAN prism. The data show abundant evidence of ongoing widespread deformation across the entire region from the deformation front to the uppermost slope and extending into the Calabrian emerged region. The seafloor mapping shows numerous mud volcanoes associated to fault activity. The seismic images display deformational features active across the entire prims at different locations extending the definition of structures described in previous works of the region with fewer areal coverage. The data show a prism tectonic structure that is distinct from the structure of prism in other subduction systems worldwide...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} a radiographic system for imaging marine sedimentary structures in situ, {{as an alternative}} to the currently used intrusive and tedious process of <b>imaging</b> extracted <b>core</b> samples in the laboratory.

Introduction: Extracted cores of marine sediments are x-rayed in the laboratory [1], to facilitate the analysis of its properties, sedimentary structure (formation mechanism), and biological content. Sediment cores are typically shaped as rectangular or cylindrical columns, extracted from marine sediment floors by a suitable coring technique [2].

40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Bacterial {{antimicrobial}} resistance is an escalating public health threat, yet the current antimicrobial pipeline remains alarmingly depleted, making {{the development of}} new antimicro-bials an urgent need. Here, we identify a novel, potent, imidazoline antimicrobial compound, SKI- 356313, with bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Gram-positive cocci, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). SKI- 356313 is active in murine models of Streptococcus pneumoniae and MRSA infection and is potently bactericidal for both replicating and nonreplicating M. tuberculosis. Using a combination of genetics, whole genome sequencing, and a novel target ID approach using real time <b>imaging</b> of <b>core</b> macromolecular biosynthesis, we show that SKI- 356313 inhibits DNA replication and displaces the replisome from the bacterial nucleoid.

Using a series of Au L 3 -edge XANES reference spectra we show that most of the relevant information can be captured through a small number of rules applied to constrain the fits. Uncertainty in this strategy arises mostly when the ionisation potential (IP) overlaps with weak electronic transitions or features in the continuum beyond the IP, which can result in ambiguity through multiple equally good fits...|$|E
