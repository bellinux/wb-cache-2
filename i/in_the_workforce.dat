5|$|Although the {{proportion}} of bal maidens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workforce</b> fell steadily, the mining boom {{of the first half}} of the 19thcentury took the total number to between 4,000 and 14,400 by the 1840s. The 1841 Census (the first full census of England) shows 3,250 women working in the mines, but the mine returns of the same year show over 5,000 women in the tin, lead and copper mines of Cornwall and West Devon. Increased mechanisation of the ore dressing process and public concerns over subjecting women and children to the harsh working conditions of the mines meant that {{the proportion}} of bal maidens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workforce</b> continued to fall, and it is generally accepted that by 1850 between 15 and 20% of mine workers were female. By the 1861 census, coinciding with the peak of the Cornish mining industry, a minimum of 6,000 women were working in mining in Cornwall, at least 2,500 of whom worked within a five-mile radius of Camborne. Although employed primarily in copper and tin mines, bal maidens also worked in lead, zinc, manganese, iron, antimony, wolfram, and uranium mines, and in slate and china clay quarries.|$|E

5|$|About 222million {{women who}} want to avoid {{pregnancy}} in developing countries are not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use in developing countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workforce,</b> and less use of scarce resources.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developing}} world, birth control increases economic growth due to there being fewer dependent children {{and thus more}} women participating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workforce.</b> Women's earnings, assets, body mass index, and their children's schooling and body mass index all improve with greater access to birth control. Family planning via the use of modern birth control {{is one of the}} most cost-effective health interventions. For every dollar spent, the United Nations estimates that two to six dollars are saved. These cost savings are related to preventing unplanned pregnancies and decreasing the spread of sexually transmitted illnesses. While all methods are beneficial financially, the use of copper IUDs resulted in the greatest savings.|$|E

5|$|Increasing labour export {{from the}} Philippines {{coincided with the}} {{economic}} rise of Hong Kong during the late 1970s and early 1980s. When the People's Republic of China implemented wide-reaching economic reform in the late 1970s and initiated trade with other countries, Hong Kong became mainland China's biggest investor. Labour-intensive Hong Kong industries moved to the mainland, and high-profit service industries in the territory (such as design, marketing and finance) expanded dramatically. To deal with the resulting labour shortage and increase in labour costs, the female labour force was mobilised. Two-income families sought help to manage their households, creating a demand for domestic workers. Female participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workforce</b> increased, from 47.5 percent in 1982 to 54.7 percent in 2013. Families began hiring foreign domestic workers from the Philippines, {{with the number of}} workers steadily increasing during the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Some {{parts of}} Western Europe, {{especially}} Scandinavian {{countries have been}} creating family friendly policies that have aided them in equalizing the gender difference in {{participation in the work}} force. Nordic countries have the highest female participation rates in the work force in the world and salary differences are among the lowest. Government aid in providing care to the elderly and the young have enabled women in Scandinavia {{to be a part of}} the working population in nearly a high rate as men. Examples of government aid include paid parental leave and benefits and post maternity re-entry programs. Such programs have led to a greater participation of women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workforce,</b> as well as a higher birth rate, and a robust economy.|$|E

5|$|Japan's {{education}} system {{played a central}} part in the country's recovery and rapid {{economic growth in the}} decades following the end of World War II. After World War II, the Fundamental Law of Education and the School Education Law were enacted. The latter law defined the school system that would be in effect for many decades: six years of elementary school, three years of junior high school, three years of high school, and two or four years of university. Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program, in hopes to mitigate bullying and truancy; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide in the coming years. In Japan, having a strong educational background greatly improves the likelihood of finding a job and earning enough money to support oneself. Highly educated individuals are less affected by unemployment trends as higher levels of educational attainment make an individual more attractive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>workforce.</b> The lifetime earnings also increase with each level of education attained. Furthermore, skills needed in the modern 21st century labor market are becoming more knowledge-based and strong aptitude in science and mathematics are more strong predictors of employment prospects in Japan's highly technological economy.|$|E
