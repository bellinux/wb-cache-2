5|$|In 1988, if Kemp had won his {{campaign}} for the United States Presidency, {{it would have made}} him the first person to move from the United States House of Representatives to the White House since James Garfield. When he formed his exploratory committee, he signed <b>Ed</b> <b>Rollins,</b> Reagan's 1984 re-election political director, as an advisor. From the outset, Kemp had failed to position himself as the primary alternative to Vice President Bush. Except for a select few cognoscenti, the general public did not recognize Kemp's leadership ability, although he was a successful man of ideas. In fact, most of the Republican electorate found themselves unfamiliar with Kemp early in {{his campaign}}. Political pundits recognized him, however, as a visionary idea man. In addition, he was quickly perceived as a verbose speaker who sometimes lost contact with his audience. Although Kemp tried to appeal to conservatives, his libertarian philosophies of tolerance and individual rights and his commitment to supporting minorities, women, blue-collar workers and organized labor clashed with conservative voters' social and religious values. To Democrats, Kemp's free-market philosophies were a form of laissez-faire anarchy. However, as much as Kemp wanted to minimize government's role, he acknowledged that moves toward a more laissez-faire system should be well-thought out.|$|E

Both lackluster fundraising relative to Nelson and controversy over campaign contributions from MZM caused Harris to fall far behind in all polls by May 2006.|$|E

25|$|Several {{months before}} the Democratic and Republican conventions, Perot filled the vacuum of {{election}} news, as his supporters began petition drives to {{get him on the}} ballot in all 50 states. This sense of momentum was reinforced when Perot employed two savvy campaign managers in Democrat Hamilton Jordan and Republican <b>Ed</b> <b>Rollins.</b> In July, while Perot was pondering whether to run for office, his supporters established a campaign organization United We Stand America. Perot was late in making formal policy proposals, but most of what he did call for were intended to reduce the deficit, such as a gasoline tax increase and cutbacks to Social Security.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{discussion}} of substantive issues, the campaign's seriousness continued to come under attack. [...] Ed Koch elevated his criticisms of the campaign, calling it [...] "fraudulent" [...] and arguing that Trump is the [...] "greatest con artist in the world {{when it comes to}} trumpeting his own name [...] [...] [...] [...] y gut tells me that he knows nothing [...]" [...] Former White House adviser Dick Morris said [...] "I think he's mainly selling books." [...] Republican strategist <b>Ed</b> <b>Rollins</b> questioned whether Trump could [...] "say the right things" [...] or [...] "be willing to let somebody put an organization together." [...] A New York Daily News/WNBC-TV poll showed that 74% of New Yorkers believed the campaign was being used only for Trump [...] "to promote himself." [...] Roger Stone commented that the perception problem would [...] "solve itself" [...] once the campaign would reveal the number of petition signatures it collected. [...] By mid-November, the campaign started receiving advice from political consultant Douglas Friedline, who ran Ventura's successful 1998 gubernatorial campaign. [...] Upon Friedline's advice, Trump assembled communications and campaign staff, and began planning events in strategic states. As a further step in organization, Trump set up a campaign website at the domain www.donaldjtrump2000.com and used Ventura's webmaster, Phil Madsen, to create an online community of supporters.|$|E

500|$|Although {{he did not}} {{campaign}} or advertise, Perot won a {{large share}} of the vote in both the Democratic and Republican primaries in Oregon and Washington in mid-May. In the Oregon primary, he was written-in by 13% of Democrats and 15% of Republicans. Exit polling showed Perot's favorability at or above that of Clinton and Bush in their respective party's primaries. At the end of May, Perot called on Bush to [...] "climb in the ring", claiming that the President was using surrogates to attack him. To strengthen his own team, Perot's campaign interviewed Jimmy Carter's 1976 campaign manager and White House Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan and [...] Ronald Reagan's 1984 campaign manager <b>Ed</b> <b>Rollins</b> to fill a position in the campaign. Eventually, both were hired as co-campaign managers. On May 29, Perot ended his talk show hiatus after talking with Barbara Walters on 20/20. He discussed his three-part plan for balancing the budget, starting with a Congressional act to limit spending, followed by a cut in government waste, of which he would be more specific in coming weeks, and a reform of the existing tax system. During the interview, Perot also stated that he would avoid adding homosexuals to his cabinet to prevent [...] "a point of controversy with the American people". However, he commented that [...] "what people do in their private lives is their business." ...|$|E
500|$|By mid-July, the Washington Post {{reported}} that Perot's campaign managers were becoming increasingly disillusioned by his unwillingness {{to follow their}} advice {{to be more specific}} on issues, and his need to be in full control of operations with such tactics as forcing volunteers to sign loyalty oaths. Perot's poll numbers began to slip to 25%, and his advisers warned that if he continued to ignore them, he would fall into single digits. Co-manager Hamilton Jordan threatened to quit, and on July 15, <b>Ed</b> <b>Rollins</b> resigned after Perot fired advertisement specialist Hal Riney, who worked with Rollins on the Reagan campaign. Rollins later claimed that a member of the campaign accused him of being a Bush plant with ties to the CIA. Amidst the chaos, Perot's support fell to 20%. The next day, Perot announced on Larry King Live that he would not seek the presidency. He explained {{that he did not want}} the House of Representatives to decide the election if the result caused the electoral college to be split. He asked his supporters to look for other candidates to nominate for the race, and formed United We Stand to [...] "influence the debate." [...] At this point, Perot had spent $12 million of his own money on the race. Bill Hillsman, who produced a few unaired advertisements for the campaign, wrote that Perot's withdrawal was a tactic to find temporary relief from the press.|$|E

2500|$|After the 1980 election, Atwater went to Washington {{and became}} an aide in the Ronald Reagan administration, working under {{political}} director <b>Ed</b> <b>Rollins.</b> In 1984, Rollins managed Reagan's re-election campaign, and Atwater became the campaign's deputy director and political director. Rollins mentions Atwater's work several times in his 1996 book Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms. He states that Atwater ran a dirty tricks operation against Democratic vice-presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro, including publicizing the fact that Ferraro's parents had been indicted on numbers running in the 1940s. Rollins also described Atwater as [...] "ruthless", [...] "Ollie North in civilian clothes", and someone who [...] "just had to drive in one more stake".|$|E

Wade and Harris discussed MZM's desire for a $10million appropriation, and Wade offered to host a fundraiser for Harris's 2006 Senate campaign.

[...] He supported the George W. Bush administration and its policies, including the war in Iraq. [...] Spencer came {{out in favor of}} New York's Court of Appeals denying same-sex marriage to 42 gay and lesbian couples who challenged that denial as unconstitutional. Spencer said that marriage equality for same-sex couples equated to [...] "special rights for gays." [...] Spencer was endorsed by Republican officials such as Congressman Vito Fossella. [...] In contrast, McFarland was pro-choice. [...] However, McFarland ran into trouble with a March comment that appeared to allege that the Clinton campaign had been flying helicopters low over her Southampton, New York house and spying on her; she later said she had been joking, but the episode upset her. [...] In May, McFarland's campaign manager <b>Ed</b> <b>Rollins</b> made personal life charges against Spencer, to which the latter responded, [...] "Shame on you." ...|$|E

Whatever his reasons for withdrawing, his reputation was badly damaged. Many of his supporters felt betrayed and public opinion polls [...] subsequently showed a large negative view of Perot that was absent prior to his decision to end the campaign.|$|E
