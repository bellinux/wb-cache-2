KuhnDesigners of mixed-signal systems must {{understand}} coupling mechanisms at the system, PC board, package and integrated circuit levels to control crosstalk, and thereby minimize degradation of system performance. This research examines coupling mechanisms in a RF-targeted high-resistivity partially-depleted Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) IC process and applying similar coupling mitigation strategies from {{higher levels of}} design, proposes techniques to reduce coupling between sub-circuits on-chip. A series of test structures was fabricated {{with the goal of}} understanding and reducing the electric and magnetic field coupling at frequencies up to C-Band. Electric field coupling through the active-layer and substrate of the SOI wafer is compared for a variety of isolation methods including use of deep-trench surrounds, blocking channel-stopper implant, blocking metal-fill layers and using substrate contact <b>guard-rings.</b> Magnetic coupling is examined for on-chip inductors utilizing counter-winding techniques, using metal shields above noisy circuits, and through the relationship between separation and the coupling coefficient. Finally, coupling between bond pads employing the most effective electric field isolation strategies is examined. Lumped element circuit models are developed to show how different coupling mitigation strategies perform. Major conclusions relative to substrate coupling are 1) substrates with resistivity 1 kΩ·cm or greater act largely as a high-K insulators at sufficiently high frequency, 2) compared to capacitive coupling paths through the substrate, coupling through metal-fill has little effect and 3) the use of substrate contact <b>guard-rings</b> in multi-ground domain designs can result in significant coupling between domains if proper isolation strategies {{such as the use of}} deep-trench surrounds are not employed. The electric field coupling, in general, is strongly dependent on the impedance of the active-layer and frequency, with isolation exceeding 80 dB below 100 MHz and relatively high coupling values of 40 dB or more at upper S-band frequencies, depending on the geometries and mitigation strategy used. Magnetic coupling was found to be a strong function of circuit separation and the height of metal shields above the circuits.

Over the years, the instrument, which is designed by the LPP/CNRS, has become a reliable and essential device due to the in situ demonstrated performances in terms of high magnetic resolution, robustness, low power consumption and its ease of implementation. The SCM operates in low-frequencies from 0. 1 Hz to a few dozen kHz. Therefore, {{in order to achieve}} a femtoTesla (fT/sqrt(Hz)) sensitivity (noise floor), the equivalent input noise of the readout electronics must be lower than some nV/sqrt(Hz). Here, we are particularly confronted to the flicker noise (1 /f). The electronics’ power consumption is to be considered during the design flow since this is a crucial aspect in space applications, among other specifications, for the instrument’s lifetime. Furthermore, related effects to cumulative radiation dose, heavy ions and temperature should not impact the readout electronics specifications and therefore the SCM sensitivity. In this paper, we will introduce the principle of the designed SCM for JUICE (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer) which operates in the frequency range 0. 1 Hz – 20 kHz. The SCM should provide a 4 fT @ 5 kHz sensitivity (noise floor). The mission’s environment requires an operating temperature of - 150 °C and a total ionizing dose of 300 krads (under shielding). To meet those constraints, an application-specification-integrated-circuit (ASIC) designed in 0. 35 µm CMOS technology is proposed. It consists of a low flicker noise preamplifier. The interest in a monolithic integration of the readout electronics is explained. An analytic study of MOSFET transistor noise contribution was done to allow the considerable reduction of the flicker noise (1 /f) and to achieve, thanks to an appropriate transistors dimensioning, an input equivalent noise of 4 nV/sqrt(Hz) and a current noise of 20 fA/ sqrt(Hz) at 10 Hz. The chip was exposed to a 300 krads of Colbalt- 60 total ionizing dose (TID) and tested in nitrogen temperature (77 °K).

40|$|Doping {{technologies}} for formation of ultrashallow and highly-doped p+ junctions are continuously demanded {{to face the}} challenges in front-end processing that have emerged due to the aggressive downscaling of vertical dimensions for future semiconductor devices. As an alternative to implantations, current solutions are based on in-situ boron (B) doping during Si/SiGe chemical vapor deposition (CVD) by using diborane (B 2 H 6) as the dopant gas. In this context, {{a few studies have}} demonstrated p+-like doping behavior of n-type (100) -oriented Si surfaces after exposure solely to B 2 H 6 in an oxygen-free atmosphere without any extra addition of silane-based sources. As illustrated in Chapter 1, this doping process relies on the thermal decomposition of the source gas, so that the available boron atoms may stick to the surface, chemically react with silicon atoms, and diffuse into the substrate. Contrary to other doping impurities, by appropriately varying the source gas parameters and the exposure time, the reaction kinetics can also cause the boron density at the silicon surface to significantly increase beyond the solid solubility in Si at the given processing temperature. Thus, a boron layer can be formed. However, this property has not been explored so far with respect to reliable integration in Si-based device technologies, since boron segregation has been commonly addressed as a drawback of this doping method. This thesis presents the characterization of nanometer-thick B-layers formed during exposure to diborane in a commercially available CVD system at either atmospheric or reduced pressures down to 500 C by using B 2 H 6 at high concentrations. The process, as described in Chapter 2, substantially differs from previous approaches both with respect to the low temperature used and the gas exposure conditions. The former is generally very attractive for versatile use of a doping technology, while the excessive B adsorption intentionally promoted on the Si surface, i. e. the deposition of a B-layer, is demonstrated to offer unprecedented advantages for the formation of ultrashallow and low leakage pn-junctions. Analytical techniques, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), in conjunction with an extensive electrical characterization are applied to investigate the material and electrical properties of the B-layers {{as a function of the}} deposition conditions. The experimental results are also validated by process and device simulations. The formation of B-layers is slower the lower the temperature and the diborane partial pressure, and mainly controlled by the exposure time at high gas flow rates that provide good conditions for segregation of boron atoms on the Si surface. While gas parameters can determine the transition from surface Si doping to B-deposition, the temperature mainly influences the final composition of the deposited film that can vary from amorphous boron (a-B) to a boron-silicon compound, i. e. boron-silicide, (BxSiy), for temperatures increasing from 500 C to 800 C. The deposition exhibits high selectivity to Si, isotropy, and uniformity for any surface topography and patterning. The time dependence of the B-layer growth is quite linear and a similar grading coefficient is observed for the boron surface density. The chemical reactivity of boron with HNO 3 -based acid solutions can be used for the removal of the layer. Furthermore, the growing B-film will act as a source for boron thermal diffusion during the CVD process itself, and the crystalline Si substrate is p-doped up to the B solid solubility. The as-diffused active boron density is also shown to be quantitatively controlled by the exposure time. Moreover, both the relatively low deposition temperature and the absence of any defect formation, which could cause enhanced-diffusion effects, ensure junction depths lower than 10 nm even after prolonged depositions. In Chapter 3, the properties of the deposited B-layers are further explored with respect to formation of high-quality, ultrashallow junctions in p+n diode configurations. Ohmic contacts, diodes, and pnp bipolar structures are fabricated and characterized under different B 2 H 6 exposure conditions. As B-deposition is commenced, the Fermi level of the exposed Si surface is rapidly shifted towards the valence band, as one would expect for electrically active p-type doping. This is beneficial for formation of very low-ohmic contacts on p-type surfaces, while pn diodes are formed on n-type Si substrates. In the latter case, the near-ideal saturation current can be tuned from high Schottky-like values to low deep-pn-junction-like values by increasing the deposited B-layer thickness by just a few nm. The integration of B-deposited emitters in pnp structures has shown that the presence of a distinct a-B layer, which occurs for min-long exposures, is an effective way to suppress the electron minority carrier injection from the n-substrate. This results in an effective Gummel number 60 times higher than that of the diffused emitter only. The doping efficiency is also demonstrated to be superior to that in conventional B-doped Si epitaxy and comparable to B+ / BF 2 + ion implants. Although for increasing thickness the series resistance through this high-resistive layer will eventually dominate the I-V behavior, processing conditions can be found where exceptionally low values of both series resistance and saturation current can be achieved. However, the high-ohmic property can be used as a means of fabricating very compact, small area, and non-linear resistors. The compatibility of the doping technique with standard Si device manufacturing is also proven. Also for the use of hard-mask materials other than SiO 2 the selectivity of the B-layers to deposit only in the contact openings to the Si has been demonstrated. Furthermore, due to the excellent isotropic coverage, the B-deposition can be applied to non-planar device schemes such as trenches and recessed-contact technologies. Although the boron chemical concentration significantly exceeds the solid solubility at the silicon surface, for as-deposited B-layers the active dopants of the c-Si substrate is found to be essentially limited by substitutional incorporation at the deposition temperature. However, in Chapter 4 the B-layer is demonstrated to act as a well-controlled source of dopant for solid-phase diffusion during any subsequent in-situ or ex-situ high-temperature annealing step. The presence of a sufficiently thick B-layer offers, due to its thermal stability, the additional advantage of being able to minimize boron evaporation. Thus, a higher dopant activation can be obtained with a good control of the resulting junction depth. Furthermore, the use of B 2 H 6 exposure and thermal anneal as post-processing gives more insights into the influence of processing parameters on the boron adsorption mechanism. In particular, at very low temperatures, hydrogen termination of the silicon surface is assumed to influence the sticking of boron atoms. In this respect, the carrier gas can play a significant role. Finally, thermal anneals are also applied to increase the doping efficiency of B-layers that act as emitters in pnp bipolar transistors. The unique properties of the boron CVD deposition are exploited with great advantages in p+n diodes fabricated at 700 C for the integration of two distinct device technologies: varactor diodes for adaptive functions in radio frequency (RF) applications and photodiodes for detection of ultraviolet (UV) radiation. In the former case, B-deposition offers a defect-free, low-temperature process module within the silicon-on-glass (SOG) substrate-transfer technology to form one-sided p+n-junctions that can preserve hyper-abrupt arsenic profiles needed for highly-linear tunable varactors. On the other hand, the fundamental advantages of the B-layers for use as a novel p+ front-layer in UV detectors are given by the extremely ultrashallow and highly-doped junction that is instrumental in the collection of the photogenerated carriers. Since both devices operate in reverse biasing mode, in Chapter 5 the electrical performance of the B-layers is investigated when reverse voltages are applied up to the expected diode breakdown limit. Device simulations demonstrate that the high electric field induced by the nm-deep p+ junction at the anode contact edges is responsible for band-to-band tunneling current. Thus, the reverse I-V characteristics of as-deposited B-doped varactors would suffer from high leakage current and premature breakdown. Diffused p+ <b>guard-rings</b> are proposed as a solution to reduce the electric field crowding at the contact rim. In addition, n+ channel-stop implants are used to prevent the depletion region from extending excessively under the MOS structure formed by the anode metallization on the SiO 2 isolation layer and approach regions with reduced generation-recombination lifetimes. Then, the silicon-on-glass varactor technology is illustrated along with the electrical characterization results. A noteworthy improvement of the reverse I-V performance is shown for varactor implementations with either uniform or hyper-abrupt 1 /x^ 2 As profiles when BF 2 + and P+ implants are included in the process to form <b>guard-rings</b> and channel-stop regions, respectively. The devices have unprecedented low reverse current and an increased operating voltage range close to the theoretical breakdown limit. At the same time, the desired capacitance-voltage relationship is still preserved by the compatibility of the thermal processing steps with the As profiles. Chapter 6 describes the integration of B-layers in a silicon-based planar p+n photodiode technology for radiation detection in the complete UV spectral range down to soft X-ray wavelengths. The B 2 H 6 exposure conditions for the formation of the sensitive surface are specifically optimized to minimize any possible quantum efficiency loss due to absorption and reflection of radiation in the front a-B layer. Without compromising the optical conversion efficiency, the B-deposition can be combined with in-situ thermal annealing and/or selective epitaxial Si growth to reduce the series resistance of the front p+ layer. An optical coating can also be integrated to either reduce reflection losses or determine a filtering radiation pass-band. Outstanding photodiode performance is achieved, since comparison with the state-of-the-art silicon detector technology shows that B-deposited devices perform with superior electrical and optical characteristics. In fact, they exhibit an ideal diode behavior with lower dark current. Furthermore, the extremely shallow front active p+ region offers higher sensitivity over a wider UV spectral range with excellent reproducibility. In particular, they show near a theoretical responsivity at short-wavelengths that is also very stable under high-dose radiation exposure. Finally, the main conclusions of the thesis are summarized in Chapter 7, which also provides recommendations for the future work. In particular, the research activity has shown that the B-layer can be seen as a new IC compatible doping material that owing to the unique properties can be both instrumental in the downscaling of bipolar/CMOS transistors and very attractive for many novel Si device configurations.

40|$|This {{research}} {{has made a}} comparative investigated of crosstalk in backside illuminated and frontside illuminated single junction photodiode and vertical double junction photodiode CMOS compatible pixels, using a commercial 2 D device simulation package, SEMICAD DEVICE (1994). Comparison of pixel total, electron and hole quantum efficiency response and Absorption Volume data is undertaken. This is so that the underlying carrier drift-diffusion dynamics responsible for optimal pixel response resolution may be qualitatively understood, allowing prediction of even more optimal photodiode pixel configurations. The effect of varying the double junction and single junction photodiode pixel 2 ̆ 7 s geometry on response resolution is considered. Only for the former {{is the effect of}} doping, biasing and introducing highly doped pixel boundary trenches on response resolution undertaken. Additionally, for the former pixel, the effect of introducing a <b>guard-ring</b> electrode on its electrical response resolution is investigated. For single junction photodiode pixels, the boundary trench isolation, a highly doped recombination boundary trench placed either side of each pixel 2 ̆ 7 s well, showed considerably less pixel response resolution and hence more crosstalk than using the <b>guard-ring</b> electrode configuration. However the boundary-trench-isolation-pixel 2 ̆ 7 s response was an improvement on the unguarded single junction photodiode pixel 2 ̆ 7 s response. The outer junction of the double junction photodiode pixel acts {{in the same way as}} the <b>guard-ring</b> electrode for the single junction photodiode pixel, by suppressing the pixel response away from the pixel centre. However for pixels with similar geometry of outer well and substrate to the single junction photodiode guarded pixel, the outer junction 2 ̆ 2 guard 2 ̆ 2 improves the pixel response resolution more than the electrode guard does. However for shallow pixels their response resolutions are not significantly different, in that response outside the 2 ̆ 2 well 2 ̆ 2 (outer well in double junction photodiode pixels) is insignificant. The response resolution is more flexibly varied inside this 2 ̆ 2 well 2 ̆ 2 for the double junction than for the guarded single junction photodiode pixel. Generally the frontside illuminated photodiode pixels have better response resolution and hence crosstalk suppression than the same pixel backside illuminated. This is due primarily to their greater depletion region absorption volume proportion. This results from the closer proximity of their photogenerated carrier-envelope to their pixel 2 ̆ 7 s depletion region. However as frontside and backside illuminated pixel absorption volume proportions converge, their response resolution becomes less distinguishable. The predictive advantage of pixel absorption volume data for optimal pixel response resolution is evident. Such data can help to narrow the selection of possible optimal pixel configurations.

The <b>guard-ring</b> structure prevents the premature breakdown; the polysilicon layer prevents the surface leakage. It was also found that the more the driving time of furnace, the higher the breakdown voltage of the Schottky diode. The breakdown characteristic of a Schottky diode was shown to be closely related with the diusion length of the boron ions being inside the Si wafer. The electrical characteristics of the p+-polysilicon diused-guard-ring Schottky device was compared with those of the conventional diused-guard-ring sample. 7 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Hybrid pixel single-photon-counting {{detectors}} {{have been}} successfully employed and widely used in Synchrotron radiation X-ray detection. In this paper, the silicon pixel sensors for single X-ray photon detection, which operate in full-depletion mode have been studied. The pixel sensors were fabricated on 4 -inch, N type, 320 μm thick, high-resistivity silicon wafers. The pixel sensors has a p+-in-n structure with varies of pixel size and gap size including <b>guard-ring</b> structures. Later, the pixel sensor was wire bonded to the ASIC circuits and tested {{for the performance of}} X-ray response in the synchrotron beam line (BSRF, 1 W 2 B). From the S-curve scan, we could get the energy resolution and the linear properties between input energy and the equivalent generator amplitude.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a complete portfolio of RF and baseband components by adopting RFCMOS technology for single-chip systems. Using optimised CMOS topology and deep n-well, the performance {{relates to the}} f(t) of 60 GHz and f(max) of 53 GHz at 10 mA, an f(t) of 70 GHz and f(max) of 58 GHz at maximum-transconductance bias, and a minimum noise figure of 1. 5 dB without ground-shielded signal pad. High quality-factor inductors are obtained using thick copper interconnects; the measurement result demonstrates the corresponding quality factor of 18 at 1. 7 nH. The MIM capacitors, as well as accumulation-mode MOS and junction varactors are also optimised for improving quality factor. For the purpose of eliminating inter-block coupling noise penetrating through the substrate, a deep n-well isolation and a p-well <b>guard-ring</b> have been adopted to suppress the substrate noise by 25 dB and 10 dB, respectively...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAfter the Phase II upgrade for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the {{increased}} luminosity requests a new upgraded Inner Tracker (ITk) for the ATLAS experiment. As a possible {{option for the}} ATLAS ITk, a new pixel detector based on High Voltage/High Resistivity CMOS (HV/HR CMOS) technology is under study. Meanwhile, a new CMOS pixel sensor is also under development for the tracker of Circular Electron Position Collider (CEPC). In order to explore the sensor electric properties, such as the breakdown voltage and charge collection efficiency, 2 D/ 3 D Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) simulations have been performed carefully for the above mentioned both of prototypes. In this paper, the <b>guard-ring</b> simulation for a HV/HR CMOS sensor developed for the ATLAS ITk and the charge collection efficiency simulation for a CMOS sensor explored for the CEPC tracker {{will be discussed in}} details. Some comparisons between the simulations and the latest measurements will also be addressed...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{calculations}} of time-dependent charge distributions are presented and compared with distributions measured on radiation-charged electrets made of thin polymer films, which are charged and discharged in a Radiation-Charged Electret Ionization Chamber (REIC) {{through the application}} of ionizing radiation. The chamber resembles a parallel plate ionization chamber, and has a thin film of polymer covering the collector and <b>guard-ring</b> electrodes. Calculations are performed by solving Laplace's Equation for the true geometry of the charging/discharging set-up, then applying estimates of ion-density distributions generated from known scattering distributions and/or simpler approximations. Measurements of radiation induced conductivity (RIC) are presented and fitted to an empirically derived analytical model, and the effects of RIC on the operation of a radiation dosimeter based on the electret are investigated and discussed. Short-term and long-term charge decay from the electret is measured and fitted to a previously developed model. The effects of post-charging heat treatment of the radiation-charged electret are presented and discussed. Lastly, the dosimetric characteristics of the REIC are considered in light of those physical aspects investigated here...|$|E
40|$|Noise in CdZnTe devices with {{different}} electrode configurations was investigated. Measurements on devices with <b>guard-ring</b> electrode structures showed that surface leakage current {{does not produce}} any significant noise. The parallel white noise component of the devices appeared to be generated by the bulk current alone, even though the surface current was substantially higher. This implies that reducing the surface leakage current of a CdZnTe detector may not necessarily result in a significant improvement in noise performance. The noise generated by the bulk current is also observed to be below full shot noise. This partial suppression of shot noise {{may be the result}} of Coulomb interaction between carriers or carrier trapping. Devices with coplanar strip electrodes were observed to produce a 1 /f noise term at the preamplifier output. Higher levels of this 1 /f noise were observed with decreasing gap widths between electrodes. The level of this 1 /f noise appeared to be independent of bias voltage and leakage current but was substantially reduced after certain surface treatments...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{computer-based}} {{analysis is}} performed to study layout solutions aimed at increasing the breakdown voltage in Si-microstrip detectors. For optimum performance {{it is crucial}} to achieve maximum breakdown voltage for Si detectors operating at very high bias due to the extremely hostile radiation environment of next generation experiments such as LHC. The performance of Si-microstrip detectors can be improved by implementing floating field-limiting rings around the active detector area. A simulation study has been carried out to evaluate the distribution of breakdown voltage as a function of <b>guard-ring</b> spacing (GS). The purpose of this work is to find a criterion to optimize GS for multiple ring structures incorporating various physical and geometrical parameters as an aid to design optimization. Using this criterion the optimum spacing of guard rings for multiple ring structures was obtained. The proposed criterion is very robust and is insensitive to the number of guard rings, junction depth and radiation damage. The simulation results for the seven-ring design agree well with experimental measurements. (21 refs) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{we report on}} the results of {{electrical}} characterization of new CdZnTe detectors grown by the Boron oxide encapsulated Vertical Bridgman technique (B-VB), currently produced at IMEM-CNR (Parma, Italy). The detectors, with gold electroless contacts, have different thicknesses (1 and 2. 5 mm) and the same electrode layout, characterized by a central anode surrounded by a <b>guard-ring</b> electrode. Investigations on the charge transport mechanisms and the electrical contact properties, through the modeling of the measured current–voltage (I–V) curves, were performed. Generally, the detectors are characterized by low leakage currents at high bias voltages even at room temperature: 34 nA/cm 2 (T= 25 °C) at 10, 000 V/cm, making them very attractive for high flux X-ray measurements, where high bias voltage operation is required. The Au/CdZnTe barrier heights of the devices were estimated by using the interfacial layer-thermionic-diffusion (ITD) model in the reverse bias voltage range. Comparisons with CdZnTe detectors, grown by Traveling Heater Method (THM) and characterized by the same electrode layout, deposition technique and resistivity, were also performed...|$|E
