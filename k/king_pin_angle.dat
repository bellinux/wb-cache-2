5000|$|While no current-era {{automobile}} front suspension {{incorporates a}} physical king pin, {{the angle of}} the pivot points of the steering knuckle constitute a [...] "virtual king pin" [...] about which the wheels turn. This virtual <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> <b>angle</b> remains a fundamental design parameter. <b>King</b> <b>pin</b> <b>angle,</b> virtual or physical, is sometimes referred to as it's acronym KPA, or alternatively king pin inclination (KPI), or steering axis inclination, SAI. On most modern designs, the kingpin angle is set relative to the true vertical line, as viewed from the front or back of the vehicle. Kingpin inclination is non-adjustable, since it would change only if the wheel spindle or steering knuckles are bent. This has an important effect on the steering, making it tend to return to the straight ahead or centre position. This is because the straight ahead position is where the wheel is at its highest point relative to the suspended body of the vehicle - the weight of the vehicle tends to return the kingpin to this position. A second effect of the kingpin inclination is to set the scrub radius of the steered wheel. This is the offset between the tyre's contact point with the road surface and the projected axis of the steering down through the kingpin. If these points coincide, the scrub radius is zero. Zero scrub radius is possible without an inclined kingpin, but requires a deeply dished wheel so that the kingpin is at the centerline of the wheel. It is much more practical to incline the kingpin and use a less dished wheel, which also gives the self-centering effect. Zero scrub radius is not necessarily desirable - larger scrub radii lead to less steering effort (especially on vehicles without power steering), but more force applied to the steering components by road surface imperfections, braking, etc. Zero scrub radius isolates the steering from these effects but can lead to a [...] "dead" [...] feel for the driver which is undesirable, especially on performance vehicles.|$|E
40|$|The {{prediction}} of steering wheel torque {{in a truck}} is a challenging subject due to the many components connecting the driver to the front wheels. In order to accurately predict the steering wheel torque a highly detailed model is required. Steering systems in commercial vehicle handling simulation models found in literature are often modeled in a simple way while literature on passenger vehicles suggests {{the necessity of a}} higher model complexity. In this research a highly detailed model with four states, friction, stiffness, hydraulic assistance and the necessary kinematic relations is developed. This model could assist {{in the development of the}} steering system in the early stages of the design. The model is able to accurately predict the steering wheel torque, drag link force and <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> <b>angles.</b> The parameters for this model are estimated by means of dedicated tests and the steering system model is validated outside of the vehicle...|$|R

A <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> projected normally therefrom, and a second subassembly is adapted to be pivotally mounted on an upwardly facing surface of a tractor. The <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> is brought into contiguous relation with the first sub assembly.

50|$|Dual-pivot {{steering}} geometry (also known as virtual pivot) is a geometric arrangement of linkages in the steering {{of a car}} designed to reduce or eliminate scrub radius by moving the pivot point of the <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> outboard, {{in order to improve}} steering precision and straight line stability.|$|R

25|$|The first {{main event}} of the night, was the match for the WWE Championship between the {{champion}} Eddie Guerrero and the challenger Kurt Angle. The match was centered around both men maneuvering around on the mat. Guerrero performed a DDT and Frog Splash on Angle {{that would result in}} a <b>pin</b> attempt; <b>Angle</b> then recovered and applied an ankle lock but Guerrero escaped the hold by rolling through it and throwing Angle out of the ring. As Angle was outside, Guerrero loosened his ring boot. As Angle returned to the ring, he tried to apply the hold again. This time, Guerrero pushed Angle off with his other foot, allowing him to break free from Angle's hold.

Four different tool pin geometries, with varying <b>pin</b> <b>angles,</b> <b>pin</b> lengths, shoulder diameters and shoulder angles {{were used for}} friction stir spot welding. All the welding operations were done at the room temperature. Lap-shear tensile tests were carried out to find the weld static strength. Weld cross section appearance observations were also done. From the experiments the effect of tool geometry on friction stir spot weld formation and weld strength were determined. The optimum tool geometry for 4 mm thick polypropylene sheets were determined.

Park), with the Roldáns' hairs on the line. Electroshock won the match for his team by <b>pinning</b> <b>Angle,</b> forcing Dorian to have his head shaved bald. However, after the match, Angle, Jarrett and Dorian overpowered the winners and shaved Joaquín bald.|$|R
50|$|Drivers {{generally}} found handling on Seddon RUs vague, {{and steering}} imprecise. Geoffrey Hillditch refers to 'a most peculiar feeling' when driving one. Steering bushes, axle thrust pads and <b>king</b> <b>pins</b> were less durable {{than they should}} have been, adding to steering troubles, whilst unbalanced front wheels could cause the steering wheel to wobble. Weight was biased too much toward the rear and this exacerbated handling problems. The polyurethane bushes wore 'alarmingly' and were replaced by traditional (regularly) greased chromium-plated brass units. Springs were not substantial enough.|$|R
50|$|In the Marvel 1602 universe, Wilson Fisk is {{a pirate}} {{captain of the}} HMS Vanessa, known as the <b>King's</b> <b>Pin,</b> who attacks the ship taking Peter Parquarh and Sir Norman Osborne back to England. However, {{although}} his attack injures Osborne, {{he is able to}} take the ship when Peter deflects the cannonballs by using his webbing to throw them back at the Vanessa. Fisk is thrown into the sea when he confronts the captain directly, even rejecting Fisk's 'offer' to explain how he got his name.|$|R
