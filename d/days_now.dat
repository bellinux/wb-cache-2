5|$|The 1967 match {{continued}} {{the trend of}} American victories, as the United States won 23½–8½ at Champions Golf Club. Unlike in previous years, the 1969 match was much closer. The match {{came down to the}} last hole of the final singles match between American Jack Nicklaus and British golfer Tony Jacklin. Nicklaus made his putt, which left Jacklin with a putt to tie the match. Despite this, Nicklaus conceded the putt, picking up Jacklin's ball marker. As a result their match was tied, as was the contest at 16–16. The United States won again in 1971, beating Great Britain 18½–13½. The 1973 match was the first held in Scotland at Muirfield. The outcome remained the same as Great Britain lost 19–13. The 1975 match at Laurel Valley Golf Club was similar with the United States winning 21–11. The format changed again in 1977, as matches were reduced by nearly a third leaving 20 points available. The changed requested by Great Britain & Ireland did little to change the outcome, as the United States won 12½–7½. Golfers from continental Europe were allowed to compete {{for the first time in}} 1979. There was another change to the format, the first two <b>days</b> <b>now</b> consisted of eight foursomes and fourballs, with twelve singles matches on the final day. Again, the changes had little effect on the outcome as the United States won 17–11.|$|E

25|$|Drake {{started his}} career with Doncaster Rovers, for whom he made his Football League debut in 1902 but was soon bought by Sheffield United where he became a regular in the side for three seasons. Despite this he was viewed by some {{supporters}} as lazy with claims that he conceded possession too easily which led to regular barracking during games. He moved to Birmingham in December 1907 for £700 but his stay was only a brief one, as he moved south to Queens Park Rangers the following August. His best <b>days</b> <b>now</b> behind him he later spent five years at Huddersfield Town before finishing his career with Rotherham Town.|$|E

25|$|To {{approximate}} his {{tropical year}} Hipparchus created his own lunisolar calendar by modifying those of Meton and Callippus in On Intercalary Months and <b>Days</b> (<b>now</b> lost), {{as described by}} Ptolemy in the Almagest III.1 (Toomer 1984, p.139). The Babylonian calendar used a cycle of 235 lunar months in 19 years since 499 BC (with only three exceptions before 380 BC), {{but it did not}} use a specified number of days. The Metonic cycle (432 BC) assigned 6,940 days to these 19 years producing an average year of 365+1/4+1/76 or 365.26316 days. The Callippic cycle (330 BC) dropped one day from four Metonic cycles (76 years) for an average year of 365+1/4 or 365.25 days. Hipparchus dropped one more day from four Callippic cycles (304 years), creating the Hipparchic cycle with an average year of 365+1/4−1/304 or 365.24671 days, which was close to his tropical year of 365+1/4−1/300 or 365.24667 days.|$|E
500|$|Dietrich {{knew the}} plan had flaws. The Germans had {{captured}} the same terrain {{during the summer}} of 1940 in three <b>days.</b> <b>Now</b> they were being asked to do it in winter in five days. The plan counted on bad weather to keep the Allied planes grounded. Dietrich only had one-quarter the fuel they needed; their plan counted on capturing Allied fuel depots and keeping to an ambitious timetable. Dietrich's assigned route (or Rollbahn) included narrow roads – in many places single-tracks – which would force units of the Kampfgruppe to tail each other, creating a column of infantry and armor up to [...] long. The roads would prevent the attackers from concentrating their forces in the blitzkrieg fashion which had served them so well in the past. The main roads designated for their use had many hairpin turns and traversed steep hillsides that would delay his already slow-moving towed artillery and bridging trains. Dietrich knew that a determined fight at one of these critical choke points by even a token U.S. force could seriously impede his schedule. When Hitler's operations officer Generaloberst Alfred Jodl gave him his orders, Dietrich yelled, [...] "I'm a general, not a bloody undertaker!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 1974, {{the first}} issue of Hustler was published. Although the first few issues went largely unnoticed, within a year the {{magazine}} became highly lucrative and Flynt was able to pay his tax debts. Flynt's friend Al Goldstein said that Hustler took its inspiration from his own tabloid SCREW, but credited him with accomplishing what he had not: creating a national publication. In November 1974, Hustler showed the first [...] "pink-shots", or photos of open vulvas. Flynt had to fight to publish each issue, as many people, including some at his distribution company, found the magazine too explicit and threatened to remove it from the market. Shortly thereafter, Flynt was approached by a paparazzo who had taken nude pictures of former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis while she was sunbathing on vacation in 1971. He purchased them for $18,000 and published them in the August 1975 issue. That issue attracted widespread attention, and one million copies were sold within a few <b>days.</b> <b>Now</b> a millionaire, Flynt bought a $375,000 mansion.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1850s {{proposals}} {{to build a}} transcontinental failed because of Congressional disputes over slavery. With the secession of the Confederate states in 1861, the modernizers in the Republican party took over Congress and wanted a line to link to California. Private companies were to build and operate the line. [...] Construction would be done by unskilled laborers who would live in temporary camps along the way. Immigrants from China and Ireland {{did most of the}} construction work. Theodore Judah, the chief engineer of the Central Pacific surveyed the route from San Francisco east. Judah's tireless lobbying efforts in Washington were largely responsible for the passage of the 1862 Pacific Railroad Act, which authorized construction of both the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific (which built west from Omaha). [...] In 1862 four rich San Francisco merchants (Leland Stanford, Collis Huntington, Charles Crocker, and Mark Hopkins) took charge, with Crocker in charge of construction. The line was completed in May 1869. Coast-to-coast passenger travel in 8 <b>days</b> <b>now</b> replaced wagon trains or sea voyages that took 6 to 10 months and cost much more.|$|E
2500|$|The orchestra's first {{concert was}} held in 1912 at Tonawama Hall in Burns. With funds {{provided}} by rancher Bill Hanley, lawyer and artist Charles Erskine Scott Wood, and additional Burns businessmen, Dodge purchased musical instruments {{for the children and}} expanded the orchestra to thirty to thirty-five members. By 1915, the orchestra was touring throughout Eastern Oregon on a Chautauqua circuit. With $2,000 in funds raised by the aforementioned businessmen, the ensemble visited Western Oregon in September 1916 and performed seven concerts within two <b>days.</b> <b>Now</b> known as the Sagebrush Symphony Orchestra, the ensemble won $100 at the Oregon State Fair in Salem and performed several concerts in Portland, including one at the Imperial Hotel and one for opera singer Ernestine Schumann-Heink at the Portland Hotel. During the symphony's week-long tour, one Oregonian reporter wrote: [...] "The journey of the little people {{is considered one of the}} finest exhibitions of community spirit ever shown in this state." [...] Schumann-Heink planned to support the orchestra's efforts to tour, and promised to host a benefit concert the following year. However, the nation's involvement in World War I interrupted plans for additional tours. The orchestra disbanded in 1918 when Dodge relocated to Portland.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relation}} between lunar and solar calendar dates is made {{independent of the}} leap day scheme for the solar year. Basically the Gregorian calendar still uses the Julian calendar with a leap day every four years, so a Metonic cycle of 19 years has 6,940 or 6,939 days with five or four leap <b>days.</b> <b>Now</b> the lunar cycle counts only [...] days. By not labeling and counting the leap day with an epact number, but having the next new moon fall on the same calendar date as without the leap day, the current lunation gets extended by a day, and the 235 lunations cover as many days as the 19 years. So the burden of synchronizing the calendar with the moon (intermediate-term accuracy) is shifted to the solar calendar, which may use any suitable intercalation scheme; all {{under the assumption that}} 19 solar years = 235 lunations (long-term inaccuracy). A consequence is that the reckoned age of the moon may be off by a day, and also that the lunations that contain the leap day may be 31 days long, which would never happen if the real moon were followed (short-term inaccuracies). This is the price for a regular fit to the solar calendar.|$|E

2500|$|Returning to Britain, her {{research}} <b>days</b> <b>now</b> over, Discovery was laid up until 1936 {{when she was}} presented to the Boy Scouts Association as a static training ship for Sea Scouts in London. During the war her engines and boilers were removed for scrap to help with the war effort. Too costly for the Scouts Association to maintain she was transferred to the Admiralty in 1954 and formally commissioned as HMSDiscovery for use as a drill ship for the Royal Navy Auxiliary Reserve and also training ship for the Westminster Sea Cadet Corps. As the years passed, her condition deteriorated and when no longer of use to the Navy, she was in danger of being scrapped. The Maritime Trust, into whose care she passed in 1979, saved her from the breakers yard. Her future secured, she was berthed first on the River Thames next to [...] and , and later in St Katharine Docks. During this time, she remained the home and training ship of the Westminster Sea Cadet Corps. She reverted to the Royal Research Ship (RRS) designation and was open to the public as a museum. The sea cadet unit eventually relocated to on-shore premises in Pimlico situated in the converted basement of a local council estate. The Maritime Trust spent some £500,000 on essential restoration until she was passed into the ownership of the Dundee Heritage Trust in 1985.|$|E
