5|$|The starch {{source in}} a beer {{provides}} the fermentable material {{and is a}} key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin germination, and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugars.</b> Different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain. Darker malts will produce darker beers.|$|E

25|$|Documented {{evidence}} and recently excavated tombs {{indicate that the}} Chinese brewed alcoholic beverages from both malted grain and grain converted by mold from prehistoric times, but that the malt conversion process was largely considered inefficient {{in comparison with the}} use of molds specially cultivated on rice carrier (the resulting molded rice being called 酒麴 (Jiǔ qū) in Chinese and Koji in Japanese) to convert cooked rice into <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugars,</b> both in the amount of resulting <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugars</b> and the residual by products (the Chinese use the dregs left after fermenting the rice, called 酒糟 (Jiǔzāo), as a cooking ingredient in many dishes, frequently as an ingredient to sauces where Western dishes would use wine), because the rice undergoes starch conversion after being hulled and cooked, rather than whole and in husks like barley malt. Furthermore, the hop plant being unknown in East Asia, malt-based alcoholic beverages did not preserve well over time, and the use of malt in the production of alcoholic beverages gradually fell out of favor in China until disappearing from Chinese history {{by the end of the}} Tang Dynasty. The use of rice became dominant, such that wines from fruits of any type were historically all but unknown except as imports in China.|$|E
25|$|Yeast assimilable {{nitrogen}} or YAN is {{the combination}} of Free Amino Nitrogen (FAN), ammonia (NH3) and ammonium (NH4+) that is available for the wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to use during fermentation. Outside of the <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugars</b> glucose and fructose, nitrogen {{is the most important}} nutrient needed to carry out a successful fermentation that doesn't end prior to the intended point of dryness or sees the development of off-odors and related wine faults. To this extent winemakers will often supplement the available YAN resources with nitrogen additives such as diammonium phosphate (DAP).|$|E

Cauim {{is very similar to}} chicha and it is also made by fermenting manioc or maize, sometimes flavored with fruit juices. The Kuna Indians of Panama use plantains. A characteristic feature of the beverage is that the starting material is cooked, chewed, and re-cooked prior to fermentation.

500|$|The {{alcohol in}} beer comes {{primarily}} from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation. The quantity of <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugars</b> in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that {{determine the amount of}} alcohol in the final beer. Additional <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugars</b> are sometimes added to increase alcohol content, and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer (primarily [...] "light" [...] beers) to convert more complex carbohydrates (starches) to <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugars.</b> Alcohol is a by-product of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast; typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above 12% by volume. Low temperatures and too little fermentation time decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content.|$|E

[...] Before packaging, the beer is filtered to produce a bright, clear appearance. [...] The beer is packaged before all of the <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugars</b> have been converted to alcohol by the yeast, earlier in the process than is typical in beers.

30|$|Ozone {{oxidation}} pretreatment {{was carried}} out on spent culture media (SCMs) after Lentinula edodes cultivation to improve <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugar</b> production by enzymatic saccharification. SCM samples treated with ozone for different treatment time under various moisture contents (MCs) were enzymatically saccharified, and hydrolysis weight decrease, reducing sugar yield, and monosaccharide yields were determined. Klason lignin content in SCM samples with 20 and 40  % MC was greatly decreased by ozone pretreatment for all ozone treatment time. In addition, in the ozone-treated sample at 40  % MC, the highest hydrolysis weight decrease after saccharification was obtained in the SCM sample treated for 1  h. After saccharification, glucose yield from the ozone-treated sample for 1  h was higher than that treated for 2  h. These results indicate that ozone treatment is effective to improve <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugar</b> production by enzymatic saccharification for the SCMs of L. edodes.|$|R

30|$|Combination {{of several}} enzyme {{reagents}} complemented deficient activities in these reagents {{each other and}} effective <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugar</b> production from lignocellulosic substance was successfully demonstrated using the optimized enzyme cocktail. Several studies have regarded optimization results of enzyme for <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugar</b> production by RSM (Qin et al. 2017; Zhong et al. 2009). However, these reports arbitrarily selected several enzymes based on the previous experiences or articles. The method in this study provided better approach that started from a selection method among many kinds of commercial reagents based on detailed investigation of activities and statistical examination than vague choice of them. No matter if some reagents have to be selected from more kinds of reagents than that of in this study (15 kinds), {{the application of the}} proposed method will submit appropriate response for any biomass. And then, optimizing these enzymes by DOE will be able to induce successful hydrolysis.|$|R
500|$|Many of {{the flavor}} {{characteristics}} of Grodziskie {{result from the}} chemical makeup of the water that the breweries used to produce the beer. [...] The water {{from one of the}} wells on Poznańska Street in Grodzisk was tested, and showed a sulfate ion concentration of 183 parts per million (ppm) and a chloride ion concentration of 81 ppm. [...] Alkalinity (as calcium bicarbonate) was 350 ppm and the magnesium ion concentration was 34 ppm. [...] Using this type of water to produce beer would result in a higher than expected hop flavor because of the high alkalinity and the ratio of sulfate ions to chloride ions. [...] During the early stages of production, this water would have a higher pH, which would inhibit the efficiency of the natural enzymes that convert the starch in the grain to <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugars</b> during mashing. [...] The result is a beer with more unfermented sugars and lower average alcohol content. [...] Finally, the water would have contributed a slightly sour or bitter flavor to the beer, due to the high concentration of magnesium ions.|$|E

In many of these experiments, our objective was to determine how inoculants or inoculant/enzyme combinations affected the rate and efficiency of the ensiling process. Twenty-five different inoculants have been tested over a wide range of ensiling conditions. Results show that the majority of silage inoculants available today are able to supply a high number of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and to improve silage fermentation in most crops (KAES, Reports of Progress 494, 514, and 539). Preliminary results of 17 experiments conducted in 1988 to determine the efficacy of 12 commercial inoculants are summarized here.

2500|$|Malt is {{germinate}}d cereal grains {{that have been}} dried in {{a process known as}} [...] "malting". The grains are made to germinate by soaking in water, and are then halted from germinating further by drying with hot air. Malting grains develops the enzymes required for modifying the grain's starches into various types of sugar, including the monosaccharide glucose, the disaccharide maltose, the trisaccharide maltotriose, and higher sugars called maltodextrines. It also develops other enzymes, such as proteases, which break down the proteins in the grain into forms that can be used by yeast. Depending on when the malting process is stopped one gets a preferred starch enzyme ratio and partly converted starch into <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugars.</b> Malt also contains small amounts of other sugars, such as sucrose and fructose, which are not products of starch modification but were already in the grain.

2500|$|Wines {{from other}} fruits, such as apples and berries, are usually {{named after the}} fruit from which they are {{produced}} combined with the word [...] "wine" [...] (for example, apple wine and elderberry wine) and are generically called fruit wine or country wine (not {{to be confused with}} the French term vin de pays). Other than the grape varieties traditionally used for wine-making, most fruits naturally lack either sufficient <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugars,</b> relatively low acidity, yeast nutrients needed to promote or maintain fermentation, or a combination of these three characteristics.

The organic components are <b>fermentable</b> <b>sugars</b> (between 170-230 grams for a dry wine and between 200 and 300 grams per litre or even more for Fortified wines) and organic acids, especially malic acid and tartaric acid. Acids occur in larger amounts in the centre of the berry while the sugars are in greater proportion at the periphery. This heterogeneity in the distribution of sugars, acids, and inorganic compounds in the berry is used during pressing, especially in Champagne pressing.
