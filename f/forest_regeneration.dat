5|$|About 17.8 percent——of {{the total}} forested area of Vietnam was sprayed during the war, which {{disrupted}} the ecological equilibrium. The persistent nature of dioxins, erosion caused by loss of tree cover, {{and loss of}} seedling forest stock meant that reforestation was difficult (or impossible) in many areas. Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species (such as bamboo and cogon grass), making <b>forest</b> <b>regeneration</b> difficult and unlikely. Animal-species diversity was also impacted; in one study a Harvard biologist found 24 species of birds and five species of mammals in a sprayed forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species of birds and 30 and 55 species of mammals.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand forest {{relies heavily}} on frugivorous birds for seed dispersal: about 70% of the woody plants have fruits that are {{probably}} dispersed by birds, which included the huia. The range of fruits eaten by the huia is difficult to establish: hinau (Elaeocarpus dentatus), pigeonwood (Hedycarya arborea) and various species of Coprosma are recorded by Buller, and they were also recorded as eating the fruits of kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides). The extinction of the huia and other frugivorous New Zealand bird species including the moa and piopio, and the diminishing range of many others, including the kiwi, weka, and kōkako, has left few effective seed dispersers in the New Zealand forest. For plants with fruit greater than 1cm in diameter, kereru are the sole remaining dispersers in the ecosystem, and they are rare or extinct in some areas. This depletion of avifauna in the forest ecosystem may be having major impacts on processes such as <b>forest</b> <b>regeneration</b> and seed dispersal.|$|E

For the research were selected three stand types (beech, spruce and mixed), into which were placed 10 group cutting. There were analyzed light conditions, herb layer, density and regeneration parameters. The density of regeneration were analyzed according to the light conditions and position in the group cutting. From the measurements {{it was found that}} natural <b>forests</b> <b>regeneration</b> most easily proceeded in a spruce stand type.

Diversity of trees inside the gap corresponds to the light conditions of wood. In the central part prevailed larch, in the transition under the forest wall of shelterwood prevailed spruce and beech.

5|$|The {{introduction}} of deer to New Zealand {{began in the}} middle of the 19th century, and current populations are primarily European red deer, with only 15 percent being elk. There is significant hybridization of elk with the more numerous red deer to the extent that pure elk may no longer exist in the wild in New Zealand. These deer have had an adverse impact on <b>forest</b> <b>regeneration</b> of some plant species, as they consume more palatable species which are replaced with those that are less favored by the elk. The long-term impact will be an alteration of the types of plants and trees found, and in other animal and plant species dependent upon them.

Although dense stand conditions prior to regeneration cutting can reduce the amount of understory vegetation, numerous forest types in the world have understory vegetation that is highly shade tolerant and understory species that can respond very aggressively and competitively to canopy opening, even after partial harvests (e.g. Noguchi and Yoshida 2004; Donoso and Nyland 2005; Nilsson and Wardle 2005; Bose et al. 2014; Dodson et al. 2014).

50|$|Until recently, <b>forest</b> <b>regeneration</b> {{practices}} in North America have largely followed an agricultural model, with research concentrated on techniques for establishing and promoting early growth of planted stock after clearcutting (Cleary et al. 1978, Lavender et al. 1990, Wagner and Colombo 2001), followed by studies {{of growth and}} yield emphasizing single-species growth uninfluenced by overstorey canopy.
