5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} sexual transmission of HIV, several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms, and condoms are not typically available at bars {{and other social}} locations where they could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> HIV prevention. Many people oppose condoms {{because they believe that}} condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV.

5|$|The small glaciers in {{the forest}} are less able to resist melting than the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Once a glacier begins retreating, it may fall into disequilibrium and be unable to find mass balance (accumulation versus melting rate) at any size. Without a {{favorable}} climate change, {{it will continue to}} retreat until it disappears. Loss of glacial ice already reduces the summer glacial runoff that supplies water to streams and lakes and provides a cold-water source vital to certain fish and plant species. This, in turn, may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the forest ecosystem over time.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Aliya Rama Raya in the Battle of Talikota, Tirumala Deva Raya started the Aravidu dynasty, moved and founded a new capital of Penukonda to replace the {{destroyed}} Hampi, and attempted to reconstitute the remains of Vijayanagara Empire. Tirumala abdicated in 1572, dividing the remains of his kingdom to his three sons, and pursued a religious life {{until his death in}} 1578. The Aravidu dynasty successors ruled the region but the empire collapsed in 1614, and the final remains ended in 1646, from continued wars with the Bijapur sultanate and others. During this period, more kingdoms in South India became independent and separate from Vijayanagara. These include the Mysore Kingdom, Keladi Nayaka, Nayaks of Madurai, Nayaks of Tanjore, Nayakas of Chitradurga and Nayak Kingdom of Gingee– all of which declared independence and went on to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the history of South India in the coming centuries.|$|E

5|$|Following its {{significantly}} increased {{popularity in the}} early 21st century, reality television began to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the British music industry. Of the 274 albums that reached {{number one in the}} UK charts, 15 were by artists that had found fame through a reality TV programme. The first such act was Hear'Say, a British pop group formed by the television show Popstars. In March 2001, their debut album Popstars topped the chart and became the fastest-selling debut in UK chart history to that date. The only reality television stars to top the album chart with two different releases were Will Young, the 2002 winner of Pop Idol, Girls Aloud, the girl group formed by the TV series , and Leona Lewis, the 2006 winner of The X Factor. Like Hear'Say, Lewis's first album Spirit broke the record for the fastest-selling debut in UK chart history.|$|E
5|$|Hoping to {{capitalise}} on the spontaneous uprising that spread across Ireland in May 1798, Commodore Daniel Savary led a third, and more successful, effort. He {{took a small}} frigate squadron flying false British colours to Killala, and in August landed 1,150 French troops under General Humbert. A larger force would have been despatched, but the French had been caught unprepared—the Irish rebellion had originally been planned to coincide with a later French landing, but British intelligence operations had infiltrated the United Irishmen and arrested much of its leadership, prompting a precipitate revolt. Although the uprising achieved some early successes, by the time Humbert arrived its outcome had already been decided with the defeat of successive rebel armies by British troops. Humbert's force was joined by many United Irishmen and had some initial success, {{but was unable to}} face superior British numbers at the Battle of Ballinamuck, and surrendered on 8 September. Although its small size allowed it to reach Ireland unobserved, neither Savary's frigate squadron nor the army it carried were large enough to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Several {{recent studies}} have shown that adding seductive details does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> learner outcomes. Park et al. (2011) looked at {{cognitive}} load theory to explain these controversial results. The experiment asked high school students to learn about biology using a multimedia environment (one with seductive details and one without). The experiment also varied the cognitive load for the students. The results showed that students performed significantly higher when seductive details were present in a low cognitive load environment as compared with all other conditions. Another study by Park et al. (2015) showed that while seductive details were detrimental to learning in high cognitive load text conditions, seductive details actually improved motivation and learning outcomes in narration conditions where the cognitive load was low. This means that slideshows or webcasts with well-prepared narration that use motivating bits of information increase learner motivation.|$|E

5|$|Throughout its range, the short-tail {{stingray}} {{is caught}} incidentally by various commercial fisheries using trawls, Danish and purse seines, longlines and set lines, and drag and set nets. It is also caught by recreational fishers using hook-and-line (from boats or the shore), spears, and harpoons. Most individuals caught are released alive; often fishers cut off their tails beforehand for safety, though this practice {{does not seem}} to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the rays' long-term survival. Sport fishers occasionally keep captured rays for meat or angling competitions; a small number are also kept for display in public aquariums, and it has reproduced in captivity. As it survives fishing activities well and remains common throughout its range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the short-tail stingray as Least Concern. Within most of this species' range off New Zealand, targeting it commercially is prohibited.|$|E
5|$|A {{supernova}} is a cataclysmic {{explosion of}} a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years. During {{the history of}} the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with radioisotopes and possibly impact the biosphere. Gamma rays emitted by a supernova react with nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing nitrous oxides. These molecules cause a depletion of the ozone layer that protects the surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An increase in UV-B radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food chain. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion of the ozone layer lasting several centuries. Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one gamma ray burst that will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the planet's biosphere.|$|E
5|$|Brood {{parasitism}} by brown-headed cowbirds is common, {{with up to}} 25% of Carolina wren nests {{being affected}} in certain regions such as Oklahoma and Alabama. Cowbird parasitism peaks in April at 41%, and is as low as 8% and 0% in July and August, respectively. Female cowbirds sometimes eject Carolina wren eggs before laying their own, and even if host eggs are retained, the size of cowbird eggs negatively affect the hatching success of wren eggs. As a result, cowbirds may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the reproductive success of wrens. The feeding rate for cowbird nestlings is higher than wren feeding rates, and some have been raised to independence. This also can be detrimental {{to the survival of}} wren nestlings. A rare instance of brood-parasitism by a house finch has been recorded. The rate of brood parasitism is thought to be lower in more natural and concealed nesting locations. Body parasites such as the larvae of blowflies feed on nestlings and the blood loss weakens nestlings. Fellow species of wren such as Bewick's wren and the winter wren compete for nesting locations and food, respectively.|$|E
