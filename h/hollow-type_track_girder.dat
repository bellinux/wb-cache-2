50|$|Nolan River Bridge is {{a single}} <b>track</b> <b>girder</b> bridge located in Blum, Texas. The bridge was {{constructed}} in stages between 1899 and 1903 to replace an earlier bridge. The bridge contains six spans between the abutments and five supporting limestone piers. The bridge was designed to carry a live load equal to two 139-ton steam locomotives. Freight and passenger trains used the bridge until 1952.|$|R
50|$|The {{line from}} Alton to Winchester Junction had been opened on 2 October 1865 and {{taken over by}} the LSWR in 1876. A wooden bridge had been {{provided}} over the Alton-Winchester road at the Butts. With the construction of the Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway, and the MVR then being under construction, a double <b>track</b> <b>girder</b> bridge replaced the original wooden bridge in 1900.|$|R

50|$|A second station (Carmarthen Town) {{was opened}} by the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway in 1860 on its route northwards towards Cynwyl Elfed and Pencader which {{was much better}} sited for the town (on the {{opposite}} side of the river) and this remained in use until its replacement by the current station shortly after the turn of the century. The Town station did however remain in use for goods traffic thereafter beyond the closure of the final portion of the line Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway in September 1973, until the goods yard closed around 1981 - the single <b>track</b> <b>girder</b> bridge over the River Tywi was subsequently removed during 1983.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{existing}} {{variants of}} assaulting bridges, their general schemes, working principles and general tactical and technical parameters are determined. For {{the first time}} in the world an assaulting, deployable bridge is offered with a 48 meter span, which with its dimension and weight, is similar to the existing 24 meter deployable bridge. © 2008 Bull. Georg. Natl. Acad. Sci. Key words: assaulting bridge, bridgelayer, span, <b>track,</b> truss, <b>girder</b> upper boom, lower boom, strut. Military application bridges were constructed several thousand years ago. Their primary function was to allow warriors, arms and equipment to cross barriers – rivers, ravines or other naturally and artificially made obstacles. After military operations these bridges performed the func-tions of military and civil communications. Time passed and development of military equipment and bridgebuilding created improved means of erecting bridge structures in the shortest time period [1, 2]. Bridges utilized in the art of war, widely used i...|$|R
25|$|The Man on a Balcony leans nonchalantly {{against a}} {{balustrade}} occupying the foreground of the composition. At first glance he appears bathed in natural light. But upon close examination {{there is no}} clear light source or direction from which the light emanates, giving the overall work the theatrical feeling of a stage set. Aimed at a wide audience, the models monumental three-dimensional presence 'gazes' at the spectator, while the spectator contemplates the painting in return. Just as in Gleizes' Le Chemin, Paysage à Meudon (1911) and Les Baigneuses (The Bathers) of the same year, there is present throughout an interplay of perpendicular lines and hyperbolic arcs that produce a rhythm that permeate the complex urban backdrop; here of smokestacks, train <b>tracks,</b> windows, bridge <b>girders</b> and clouds (the view from the balcony of the doctors office on the avenue de l'Opéra).|$|R
