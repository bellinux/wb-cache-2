The orbital radius where the UV flux matches that on the early Earth lies at just under 0.5AU. Epsilon Eridani's proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets have made it a destination for interstellar travel in science fiction stories.|$|E

5|$|Although {{unpalatable}} when consumed raw, when boiled {{the leaves}} of Tephrosia apollinea and numerous other plants are used to make hot drinks by the Bedouin in parts of Sinai and the Negev. But herbal doctors in Oman warn that Tephrosia apollinea can be potentially <b>harmful</b> <b>to</b> humans, and as of 1993 {{it had not been}} fully analyzed chemically to assess the wider impact it could have on health.|$|E
5|$|Americium is an {{artificial}} element of recent origin, and thus {{does not have}} a biological requirement. It is <b>harmful</b> <b>to</b> life. It has been proposed to use bacteria for removal of americium and other heavy metals from rivers and streams. Thus, Enterobacteriaceae of the genus Citrobacter precipitate americium ions from aqueous solutions, binding them into a metal-phosphate complex at their cell walls. Several studies have been reported on the biosorption and bioaccumulation of americium by bacteria and fungi.|$|E

25|$|A {{less obvious}} hazard of welding is {{exposure}} <b>to</b> <b>harmful</b> chemicals. Exposure <b>to</b> certain metals, metal oxides, or carbon monoxide can {{often lead to}} severe medical conditions. Damaging chemicals can be produced from the fuel, from the work-piece, or from a protective coating on the work-piece. By increasing ventilation around the welding environment, the welders will have much less exposure <b>to</b> <b>harmful</b> chemicals from any source.|$|R

5|$|Golden jackals are {{extremely}} <b>harmful</b> <b>to</b> fur-bearing rodents, such as coypu and muskrats. Coypu can be completely extirpated {{in shallow water}} bodies. During 1948–1949 in the Amu Darya, muskrats constituted 12.3% of jackal faecal contents, and 71% of muskrat houses were destroyed by jackals. Jackals also harm the fur industry by eating muskrats caught in traps or taking skins left out to dry.|$|E

5|$|It has {{not been}} shown that long term {{exposure}} to electromagnetic fields is <b>harmful</b> <b>to</b> human health, but it is recommended to avoid subjects who are pregnant or who utilize pacemakers.

The field and frequencies output by electromagnetic articulographs are comparable to those put out by computer terminals with the maximum measured being about 10μT.|$|E
5|$|Plant use of {{endophytic}} {{fungi in}} defense {{is a very}} common phenomenon. Most plants have endophytes, microbial organisms that live within them. While some cause disease, others protect plants from herbivores and pathogenic microbes. Endophytes can help the plant by producing toxins <b>harmful</b> <b>to</b> other organisms that would attack the plant, such as alkaloid producing fungi which are common in grasses such as tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{results from}} compatibility studies between AeroMACS and other systems {{operating in the}} same or adjacent frequency bands. These systems are RLAN, AMT, MLS and FSS feeder links. For compatibility with the terrestrial systems, the minimum distance to interferer is calculated, i. e. the minimum distance an interfering transmitter can be from a victim receiver without degrading the system performance beyond a permitted limit. For compatibility with FSS feeder links, the number of AeroMACS systems that may be installed in Europe without causing <b>harmful</b> interference <b>to</b> non-GEO satellite feeder link receivers is calculated. The results {{presented in this paper}} indicate that both MLS and AMT may cause <b>harmful</b> interference <b>to</b> AeroMACS if no precautions are made, while this is unlikely to happen when it comes to RLANs. Concerning compatibility with FSS feeder links, more than about 400 airports in Europe must be equipped with large AeroMACS installations <b>to</b> potentially cause <b>harmful</b> interference <b>to</b> FSS systems...|$|R

The tax farmers' profits consisted of additional amounts they could forcibly wring from the populace with Rome's blessing or turning a blind eye. Lack of effective supervision, combined with tax farmers' desire to maximize their profits, produced a system of arbitrary exactions regarded quite rightly as barbarously cruel to taxpayers, unfair, and very <b>harmful</b> <b>to</b> investment and the economy.|$|E

5|$|Aggressive mimicry is {{opposite}} {{in principle}} to defensive mimicry, where the mimic generally benefits from being treated as harmful. The mimic may resemble its own prey, or some other organism which is beneficial {{or at least not}} <b>harmful</b> <b>to</b> the prey. The model, i.e. the organism being 'imitated', may experience increased or reduced fitness, or may not be affected at all by the relationship. On the other hand, the signal receiver inevitably suffers from being tricked, {{as is the case in}} most mimicry complexes.|$|E
