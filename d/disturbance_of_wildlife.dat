To manage these sub-lethal impacts, {{we need to understand}} how activity disruptions can influence variation in individual's vital rates. This study informs the mechanistic links between whalewatching boat exposure and behavioural variation and vital rates for Mysticetes. We compared Minke whale Balaenoptera acutorostrata behaviour on a feeding ground in the presence and absence of whalewatching boats in Iceland, using individual focal follows. Activity states were inferred from movement metric data and multi-state models were used to estimate the relative proportion of different activity states. Spatially explicit mark-recapture models were used to estimate the seasonal exposure rate of individual whales to whalewatching activities. Whalewatching interactions disrupted the foraging behaviour of Minke whales, causing a decrease in proportion of time whales spent foraging. The cumulative exposure was sufficiently large to cause changes in the animal's seasonal behavioural budget. Minke whales are capital breeders, so a decrease in foraging success on feeding grounds due to whalewatching could lead to a decrease in energy available for lactation on breeding grounds, which could have negative effects on calf survival...|$|R

Fireworks {{are an important}} part of celebrations worldwide, and although humans often find fireworks spectacular, fireworks are probably perceived quite differently by wild animals. Behavioral responses to fireworks are difficult to study at night, and little is known about the negative effects fireworks may have on wildlife. Every year, thousands of tons of fireworks are lit by civilians on New Year’s Eve in the Netherlands. Using an operational weather radar, we quantified the reaction of birds to fireworks in 3 consecutive years. Thousands of birds took flight shortly after midnight, with high aerial movements lasting at least 45 min and peak densities measured at 500 m altitude. The highest densities were observed over grasslands and wetlands, including nature conservation sites, where thousands of waterfowl rest and feed. The Netherlands is the most important winter staging area for several species of waterfowl in Europe. We estimate that hundreds of thousands of birds in the Netherlands take flight due to fireworks.

40|$|Human <b>disturbances</b> <b>of</b> <b>wildlife,</b> such as tourism, {{can alter}} the {{activities}} of targeted individuals. Repeated behavioural disruptions can have long-term consequences for individual vital rates (survival and reproduction). To manage these sub-lethal impacts, {{we need to understand}} how activity disruptions can influence bioenergetics and ultimately individual vital rates. Empirical studies of the mechanistic links between whale-watching boat exposure and behavioural variation and vital rates are currently lacking for baleen whales (mysticetes). We compared minke whale Balaenoptera acutorostrata behaviour on a feeding ground in the presence and absence of whale-watching boats. Effects on activity states were inferred from changes in movement metric data as well as the occurrence of surface feeding events. Linear mixed effects models and generalised estimation equations were used to investigate the effect of whale-watching boat interactions. Measurement errors were quantified, and their effects on model parameter estimates were investigated using resampling methods. Minke whales responded to whale-watching boats by performing shorter dives and increased sinuous movement. A reduction in the probability of observing longer inter-breath intervals during sinuous movement showed that whale-watching boat interactions reduced foraging activity. Further, the probability of observing surface feeding events also decreased during interactions with whale-watching boats. This indicates that whalewatching boats disrupted the feeding activities of minke whales. Since minke whales are capital breeders, a decrease in feeding success on the feeding grounds due to whale-watching boats could lead to a decrease in energy available for foetus development and nursing on the breeding grounds. Such impact could therefore alter the calving success of this species...|$|R

This case study in a key protected area in Sri Lanka, examined the behavioral changes of Asian elephants in the context of elephant watching tourism activities. Observations of different age–sex-group classes of elephants were conducted focusing on the feeding activity of elephants in the presence vs. absence of tourists. Frequency and duration of alert, fear, stress and aggressive behaviors of elephants were significantly high in the presence of tourists and these behaviors occurred at a cost of feeding time. Tourist behavior, vehicle noise, close distances and time of the tours were closely associated with the behavioral changes of elephants.

Key results: FID did not differ among observers but AD differed between the experienced and all inexperienced observers, and among inexperienced observers. Thus, FID estimates appear more repeatable than those of AD. Experience apparently results in more conservative estimates of AD. Conclusions: FID represents a repeatable measure that is consistent across observers. This study supports its broad application in the study <b>of</b> <b>wildlife</b> escape behaviour.

Without mark-recapture studies, understanding how colonies form and, by extension, how ranges shift is challenging. Genetic studies, particularly focused on newly established colonies, provide a snapshot of colonization and can reveal {{the extent to which}} shifts in abundance and occupancy result from changes in demographic rates (e. g., reproduction and survival) or migration among suitable patches of habitat. Here, we describe the population structure of a colonial seabird breeding across a large latitudinal range in the Southern Ocean. Using multilocus microsatellite genotype data from 510 Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) individuals from 14 colonies along the Scotia Arc and Antarctic Peninsula, together with mitochondrial DNA data, we find strong genetic differentiation between colonies north and south of the Polar Front, that coincides geographically with the taxonomic boundary separating the subspecies P. p. papua and P. p. ellsworthii. Using a discrete Bayesian phylogeographic approach, we show that southern Gentoos expanded from a possible glacial refuge in the center of their current range, colonizing regions to the north and south through rare, long-distance dispersal. Our findings show that this dispersal is important for new colony foundation and range expansion in a seabird species that ordinarily exhibits high levels of natal philopatry, though persistent oceanographic features serve as barriers to movement. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Human {{infection}} with animal-borne diseases continually rises {{from year to}} year and because of this growing threat to human health, there is considerable interest in factors that could be responsible. Human <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>wildlife</b> habitat has been cited as one of the primary mechanisms the has led to the increased prevalence of these animal-borne diseases, as animals that are displaced from their native habitats are more likely to come into contact with humans, thereby increasing the probability of human infection (Markelprang et al. 2005). Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) are the primary reservoir and vector for SNV, a recently discovered Hantavirus known to be highly virulent in humans (Mills et al. 1997). Prevalence of Sin Nombre virus in deer mice have experienced differing levels of habitat disturbance by Sudden Aspen Decline (SAD). The highest prevalence of SAD in the United States is in Southwestern Colorado, where an estimated 140, 000 acres of aspen forests have been affected. In SAD affects understory vegetation, and changes in sun exposure are also likely to cause changes in the ground surface temperature. Both changes in understory vegetation and ground temperature are likely to affect small mammals who reside in the understory. These factors will result in a higher density of deer mice on high SAD sites, as well as a higher prevalence of SNV compared to low SAD sites. To establish a gradient of SAD (low= 20 % stand mortality; moderate= 20 - 60 % stand mortality; high= > 60 % stand mortality) we will sample at 12 sites. Field studies for this study will be in the Turkey creek allotment in the National Forest administered by the Mancos District. In this research I will compare if high SAD sites have both increased ground temps and greater forage availability across the spring and summer months compared to low SAD sites. This information will be used to determine if different SAD gradients increase SNV prevalence and examine if temperature and timing phenology play a role in increased deer mice contact...|$|E

The following document is intended to provide supplemental information regarding {{the application of the}} INPM noise model for environmental assessments of industrial noise sources. The INPM noise model applied in the NaiKun environmental assessment was developed by JASCO Research, originally for use by the Canadian Department of National Defense (DND) as an environmental impact assessment and forecasting tool. The model is used in planning military training activities to avoid annoyance in surrounding communities. INPM has been in regular use at Canadian Forces Base Gagetown to predict potential community annoyance in response to changing weather conditions for day to day planning of training operations. DND has also used INPM to assess potential <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> nearby <b>wildlife.</b> Extensive model validation was carried out during development of the model, both in terms of verifying the accuracy of the underlying parabolic-equation-based algorithm against accepted numerical benchmark cases and in actual comparisons of field measured and modelled received levels in various environments. An example of such model-to-data comparison is presented in Figure 1 for sound from an explosive charge detonated in a pit as recorded at 1. 6 km range across a varied terrain.

40|$|Anthropogenic <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>wildlife</b> is {{of growing}} {{conservation}} concern, but we lack comprehensive approaches of its multiple negative effects. We investigated several effects of disturbance by winter outdoor sports on free-ranging alpine Black Grouse by simultaneously measuring their physiological and behavioral responses. We experimentally flushed radio-tagged Black Grouse from their snow burrows, once a day, during several successive days, and quantified their stress hormone levels (corticosterone metabolites in feces [FCM] collected from individual snow burrows). We also measured feeding time allocation (activity budgets reconstructed from radio-emitted signals) {{in response to}} anthropogenic disturbance. Finally, we estimated the related extra energy expenditure that may be incurred: based on activity budgets, energy expenditure was modeled from measures of metabolism obtained from captive birds subjected to different ambient temperatures. The pattern of FCM excretion indicated {{the existence of a}} funneling effect as predicted by the allostatic theory of stress: initial stress hormone concentrations showed a wide inter-individual variation, which decreased during experimental flushing. Individuals with low initial pre-flushing FCM values augmented their concentration, while individuals with high initial FCM values lowered it. Experimental disturbance resulted in an extension of feeding duration during the following evening foraging bout, confirming the prediction that Black Grouse must compensate for the extra energy expenditure elicited by human disturbance. Birds with low initial baseline FCM concentrations were those that spent more time foraging. These FCM excretion and foraging patterns suggest that birds with high initial FCM concentrations might have been experiencing a situation of allostatic overload. The energetic model provides quantitative estimates of extra energy expenditure. A longer exposure to ambient temperatures outside the shelter of snow burrows, following disturbance, could increase the daily energy expenditure by > 10 %, depending principally on ambient temperature and duration of exposure. This study confirms the predictions of allostatic theory and, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, constitutes the first demonstration of a funneling effect. It further establishes that winter recreation activities incur costly allostatic behavioral and energetic adjustments, which call for the creation of winter refuge areas together with the implementation of visitor-steering measures for sensitive wildlife...|$|E
40|$|<b>Disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>wildlife</b> is {{inevitable}} {{in a world}} with a rapidly increasing human population. Whilst improving engagement {{with the natural world}} can have the benefit of encouraging people to help protect it, there is also the issue of increased potential for damaging effects of disturbance. A better understanding is needed of the circumstances under which disturbance would be expected to be a conservation problem, either alone or in combination with the impacts of other human activities. The aim of this thesis is therefore to address these questions: using wintering waders in estuarine habitats as the study system and taking a joint fieldwork and simulation modelling approach. Fieldwork was centred on Poole Harbour; an estuary and wetland of international importance located on the south coast of the UK. Disturbance experiments and observations showed that bird responses to disturbance are highly variable and related to factors including body mass, environmental conditions, site quality, and disturbance type. The energetic and lost-feeding-opportunity costs of responding to individual disturbance events were relatively small and therefore considered unlikely to cause major reductions in individual body condition or significantly limit overwintering population size, given observations of present-day spatial and temporal patterns of human activities. Simulation modelling using two types of individual-based model (IBM) supported this conclusion. Although high levels of disturbance can {{have a significant impact on}} wintering bird populations, current frequencies of human activities in Poole Harbour were not found to be reducing the carrying capacity of the site. Increased disturbance frequencies were predicted to be problematic, however, in combination with environmental change that reduced bird ability to meet their daily energy requirements: such as loss of foraging habitat through sea level rise, or reductions in prey availability due to over-exploitation. This has important implications for identifying the most effective conservation management methods. As well as site-specific management recommendations, this research contributes to understanding of the mechanisms by which disturbance may or may not have a significant impact on wintering wader populations; along with applications to other systems; and tools and general principles that conservation managers and decision makers can use to prioritise further investigation and action...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of the}} Oregon Plan is {{to restore}} wild coho and wild steelhead runs. Under the federal Endangered Species Act, wild coho salmon along the Oregon Coast are listed as Threatened and wild Oregon Coast steelhead are a {{candidate}} for listing. Although cormorants have been hazed at the Nehalem Estuary for at least 10 years and at the Tillamook and Nestucca Estuaries {{for at least three}} years, spawning ground counts of wild coho salmon, winter steelhead, and fall chinook have averaged less since hazing began. Thus, hazing {{does not appear to be}} useful in recovering wild salmonids. Hazing is not correlated with consistently improved hatchery returns. The survival of Coded Wire Tag marked coho smolts at the Nehalem was about the same whether hazing occurred or not, the percent return for coho smolts was not significantly greater at the hazed Nehalem than at the nonhazed Salmon River, and the number of returning adult coho salmon was significantly greater with hazing at the Nehalem hatchery but not at the Trask hatchery in the Tillamook Basin. For winter steelhead, the number of returning adults to the Nehalem and jacks to the Cedar Creek hatchery in the Nestucca Basin did not increase significantly with hazing, but the number of jacks returning to the Nehalem did. Changes in fisheries subsequent to hazing are mixed. Coho catches increased with hazing at the Nehalem but not at the Tillamook Basin. Nehalem steelhead catches averaged less with hazing, but chinook fisheries have grown. However, the increase in chinook catches occurred as the number of wild chinook at spawning areas declined, so the larger catch may be a consequence of a greater harvest of wild chinook rather than hazing. Returns may not have increased with hazing because it was ineffective in substantially reducing predation, because smolts saved by hazing died anyway, or because other factors such as unfavorable ocean conditions may have been much more important in affecting smolt survival than hazing. In any case, hazing does not appear to be a panacea for salmonid recovery, and it has costs.

40|$|The double-crested {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocorax auritus) {{is the primary}} avian predator on the southern catfish industry, estimated to cause $ 5 million in damage per year. To date, the most effective strategy for alleviating cormorant depredations in areas of intensive catfish production is coordinated dispersal of cormorant night roosts with pyrotechnics. Many of these night roosts are located in waterfowl refuges or wetland habitat leased for waterfowl hunting. Thus, there is an increasing concern {{about the effects of}} cormorant harassment efforts on waterfowl and other wildlife inhabiting these sites in cypress-swamp habitat. To address the need for a roost harassment device that was more species-specific, we evaluated two commercially available low- to moderate-powered lasers in a series of large-pen and field trials for their effectiveness in moving cormorants from test ponds and dispersing cormorants from their night roosts, respectively. In pen trials, laser beams directed at small groups of captive birds produced negligible effects, suggesting that the laser light was not highly aversive. This was consistent with a series of veterinary investigations suggesting no detectable ocular damage to cormorant eyes directly exposed to a selected laser at varying distances down to 1 m. During field trials both lasers, directed at roost trees after sunset, were consistently effective in dispersing cormorants in 1 to 3 evenings of harassment and is comparable to the harassment effort needed with pyrotechnics. Because laser treatment is completely silent and can be directed selectively at cormorants, these devices may be extremely useful for dispersing cormorants in sites where <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> other <b>wildlife</b> is a concern.

We found no significant difference of total energy consumption per household per year in the four nature reserves, which was about 2 Â ton of standard coal per year. But the energy consumption patterns in different reserves were different. People who live in deep mountains more relied on collecting fuelwoods from surrounding forests whereas those live in areas with relatively developed economy and better transportation condition consumed more coals, liquidinized petroleum gas and electricity. Such a pattern also reflects the changing energy spectrum during the process of modernization in China.

40|$|The {{appropriate}} {{management of}} visitors to nature reserves {{is an important}} conservation concern. In this thesis I briefly review the current literature describing the effects <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> on <b>wildlife,</b> concentrating mainly on birds (Chapter 1). Recent literature has provided worrying critiques of the practical and theoretical bases upon which management practice is based. Here, I address {{a number of questions}} that seek to clarify the impacts <b>of</b> human <b>disturbance</b> on birds. I started by asking whether behavioural measures <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> are accurate indices of the negative effects <b>of</b> <b>disturbance.</b> Through an experimental test of a theoretical model, I showed that animals that respond most to disturbance may in fact be those individuals that face the lowest cost associated with such disturbance (Chapter 2). Turnstones Arenaria interpres provided with extra food over three days showed stronger behavioural responses to a standardised disturbance stimulus than those without extra food. Behavioural measures are therefore not always a good index <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> effects. Consequently, the conclusions of some of the studies reviewed in Chapter 1 must be considered doubtful. Although some large declines in breeding success of some species are caused by human disturbance, such effects are obvious, simple to remedy and appear to be rather rare. If human disturbance is a general concern it is therefore necessary to assess whether human disturbance has impacts on species that are not obviously sensitive. To investigate this, I modelled the impact <b>of</b> human <b>disturbance</b> on the nesting success of kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla and guillemots Uria aalge (Chapter 3). By directly measuring a range of nest site parameters as well as those parameters involving human disturbance, I was able to improve the power of the analysis to detect disturbance effects over those of previous, less detailed, studies.
