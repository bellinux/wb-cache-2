40|$|Propane flaming has a {{potential}} to be utilized for effective PRE and POST weed control in both organic and conventional farming systems. Field studies were conducted at the Haskell Agricultural Laboratory of the University of Nebraska in 2010, 2011, and 2012 to: (1) describe dose–response curves for propane when flaming selected weed species at different growth stages, (2) determine corn and soybean tolerance to single and repeated flaming by utilizing the equipment designed to selectively <b>flame</b> <b>weeds</b> in row crops with torches positioned parallel to the crop row, and (3) determine the effectiveness of flaming and cultivation for weed control management under two manure levels in organic corn and soybean. Results from these studies indicate that single application of broadcast flaming can be adjusted to effectively control tansy mustard, henbit, and common lambsquarters and temporary suppress of cutleaf evening primrose, field pennycress, and dandelion. Hood technology on four-row flamer protected the major portion of the leaves from any heat damage, thus minimizing crop injury when flaming was conducted at V 5 stage of soybean and V 4 and V 6 stages of corn. Results suggest that that both corn and soybean were able to tolerate up to two flaming operations with propane dose of 45 g ha- 1 without any yield reduction; but, for best results, soybeans should be flamed at VC and after V 4 -V 5, while timing of flaming in corn is less critical. Combination of banded flaming and between row cultivation applied twice in the season was the most effecting weed control treatment in both corn and soybean. Same treatment is some cases yielded statistically similar to weed-free control and compared to cultivation twice {{there was a significant}} improvement in weed control efficacy. Alternatively, broadcast flaming could be employed to provide satisfactory weed control when conditions are too wet to cultivate. Flaming should be combined with cultivation and other non-chemical weed control practices to increase overall effectiveness of weed management programs. Adviser: Stevan Knezevi...|$|R

A strong interest is therefore devoted to pointing out “alternative” (agronomical and physical) methods for weeds control. This work reports the results of a trial performed in 2003 - 04 and 2004 - 05 in order to evaluate the effects on Coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) and Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) of four non-chemical methods for weeds control: FS (False seeding), PD (<b>Flaming),</b> MZ (Mechanical <b>weeding),</b> SM (Hand weeding) compared with two untreated controls.

40|$|Combinations {{of three}} {{different}} direct methods for controlling Vicia hirsuta (kainite application, <b>flame</b> <b>weeding</b> and harrowing) were investigated in field experiments. They were based on different strategies at early growth stages of V. hirsuta and standardised harrowing at late growth stages. The highest efficacy of kainite application and <b>flame</b> <b>weeding</b> was achieved at the one leaf stage of V. hirsuta. Winter wheat regeneration from damage caused by both kainite and thermal control was satisfactory when treatments were applied at early growth stages (GS 23). Vicia hirsuta plants that survived kainite application or <b>flame</b> <b>weeding</b> were successfully controlled by repeated harrowing at later crop growth stages; crop growth was not affected.

Four field experiments, two in direct-sown leek (Allium porrum L.) and two in direct-sown bulb onion (Allium cepa L.), {{were made}} in this investigation to {{study the effects of}} physical and cultural methods on intrarow weed numbers, time consumption for hand-weeding and marketable yield parameters. The physical methods considered were: pre-emergence flaming and harrowing, and post-emergence hoeing close to the row (only leek) and vertical brush weeding. The cultural methods were: seed priming, slurry placement, and cultivar choice (only leek). <b>Flaming</b> plus brush <b>weeding</b> gave generally the highest intrarow weed control at 92 % and 87 %, respectively, in the two leek experiments and 39 % (only brush weeding was effective) and 74 %, respectively, in the two onion experiments. Time consumption for hand-weeding following the different treatments was linearly related to the remaining numbers of intrarow weeds, with no significant influences of the experimental factors on the general relationship. Generally, the cultural methods had no significant influence on the effects of physical weeding in terms of their effect against intrarow weeds. They did not affect the tolerance or robustness of the crop plants against negative impact from the physical control methods.

40|$|Punch {{planting}} {{has recently}} been suggested to reduce intra-row weeds in organically grown row crops. In this method holes are punched in {{the ground with a}} minimum of soil disturbance and seeds are inserted into them, without soil disturbance outside the hole. The first experiments with a tractor-mounted prototype of a dibber drill (MK III) are presented here. In two years, three plant establishment procedures were compared at five different sowing dates in sugar beet and direct-sown onion. The plant establishment procedures were 1) normal sowing and mechanical control of weeds in the stale seedbed (N), 2) N + pre-emergence <b>flame</b> <b>weeding</b> (N+F), and 3) punch planting and <b>flame</b> <b>weeding</b> to control weeds in the seedbed and prior to crop emergence (P +F). The difference between N and N+F quantifies the effect of pre-emergence <b>flame</b> <b>weeding,</b> and the difference between N+F and P+F is defined to quantify the effect of the punch planting. Punch planting reduced the average intra-row weed density by 37 % (95 %-CI: 29 %- 46 %) in onion, but had no effect in sugar beet. Pre-emergence <b>flame</b> <b>weeding</b> reduced the average intra-row weed density by 59 % (95 %-CI: 53 %- 64 %) in onion and by 47 % (95 %-CI: 44 %- 51 %) in sugar beet. Delayed sowing only reduced weed emergence in 2008. In carrot, punch planting reduced the average intra-row density by 34 % (95 %-CI: 19 %- 47 %). In all crops, there were complex interactions between plant establishment procedure, year and delay of sowing. The implications of the technical inadequacies of the used dipper drill (MK III) are discussed, and it is concluded that technical improvements are required to improve crop establishment and to reduce weed emergence in the crop rows...|$|E

40|$|<b>Flame</b> <b>weeding</b> is {{the most}} common thermal intra-row weed control method used in {{agriculture}} as an alternative to herbicides in heat-tolerant crops. Within the seventh framework program project “Robot fleets for Highly Effective Agriculture and Forestry Management” (RHEA), the University of Pisa was responsible for the development of an automatic machine for intra-row cross-flaming in maize (Zea mays L.). This study focused on the selection of a range of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) doses able to control weeds without affecting crop yields, for the basic calibration of the machine. Tests were conducted in 2012 and 2013 during the growing cycle of maize both in weed-free and real-field weedy conditions. Five biological LPG doses (0, 52, 65, 104, and 130 kg ha- 1) were applied at different maize growth stages once (2 - and 5 -leaf) and twice (2 -leaf the first time and 16 days after the first time). The response of maize and weeds to cross-flaming was evaluated in terms of grain yield, weed density after <b>flame</b> <b>weeding,</b> and weed dry biomass at harvest. Log-logistic models were used to describe the responses of different growth stages of maize and weeds to single and repeated applications of LPG doses. Overall response of maize yield to <b>flame</b> <b>weeding</b> was influenced by LPG dose, number of flame weedings, maize growth stage, and presence of weeds.

40|$|Farmers are {{now more}} {{interested}} in application of weed control methods and tools with less environmental side effects. <b>Flame</b> <b>weeding</b> using propane gas is an approach with almost no any chemical residue on the soil and plant surfaces or underground water. In this research, a <b>flame</b> <b>weeding</b> machine with the ability of uniform and also discrete flaming was developed and evaluated in laboratory and field scales. In this apparatus, machine vision technology successfully discriminates between soil and weeds (plants grown in between the corn rows are considered as weeds) under natural illumination. In the laboratory tests, the effect of three forward speeds (0. 5, 0. 7 and 0. 9 m s- 1) on flam leading or lagging was investigated. The feasibility of using this technology for site-specific weed control of a corn field in comparison with conventional continuous flaming was investigated. The field trials were conducted with both continuous and discrete flaming approaches. The system performance and weed response to flaming treatments were evaluated by measuring the fuel consumption, {{counting the number of}} and weighting the survived and dead weeds one and three days after each flaming treatment. The results of laboratory tests showed that the effect of forward speed on system accuracy was significant and the system performance was more accurate at forward speeds of 0. 5 and 0. 7 m s- 1 than 0. 9 m s- 1. According to the field experiments, continuous and discrete flaming methods exhibited similar results in eradication of weeds (both number and weight-based), while the fuel consumption of the discrete flaming was lower than the continuous one.

The aims {{of this study were}} to develop custom-built machinery for thermal weed control in container nurseries and to test the weed control efficiency of <b>flame</b> <b>weeding</b> and steaming in Photinia x fraseri "Red Robin" containers.

Photinia x fraseri features (height, diameter, and dry biomass) and aesthetic parameters as affected by thermal treatments were also evaluated. The trend in temperature values of the substrate over time followed a two-phase exponential decay. All the thermal treatments lead to a continuous near- 100 % weed control level, which is the level required by growers for aesthetic reasons.

Effects of propane dose and ground speed were described by logistic models. The sigmoidal dose-response and speed-response curves imply that propane dose and the ground speed can be adjusted to the required control effect, the weed flora and the developmental stage of the plants, A 95 % reduction in susceptible annual weed species, with 0 - 4 true leaves, was achieved at propane doses of 10 - 20 kg ha^- 1, and the weeds were completely killed at 20 - 50 kg ha^- 1 (900 - 2300 MJ ha^- 1). Considerably higher doses were needed at later stages and for more tolerant species. The most tolerant species could not be controlled with one treatment, regardless of dose. Flamers with different characteristics were studied Flamers with covered burners were generally more effective than an open flamer, especially on larger plants and tolerant species. The effective ground speed was generally higher for flamers with a higher fuel input, but only up to a certain level, A flamer with a relatively high propane consumption of 34 kg h^- 1 per metre working width (440 kW m^- 1) allowed an effective ground speed of 8 km h^- 1 when smaller plants were treated, whereas the effective ground speed was 2, 6 km h^- 1 for a flamer with the more usual burner power of 12 kg h^- 1 m^- 1 (150 kW m^- 1).

It also analysed the effects of various liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) doses on total asparagus yield, mean spear weight, and total number of marketable spears. In both years, the asparagus spears were generally not damaged by <b>flame</b> <b>weeding</b> using LPG doses of between 43 to 87 kg/ha. The same LPG doses were effective in controlling weeds, showing the same total marketable yields as the weed-free control. At high LPG doses (e. g. 130 and 260 kg/ha), yields decreased {{as a consequence of}} the damage caused to the spears, resulting in a lower number of marketable spears. Flaming did not affect the mean spear weight, and can be applied repeatedly during harvesting to maintain the weeds at a level that does not lead to a yield reduction. The repeated use of the combined flamer-cultivator (every seven days) led to higher yields than plots where weed control was not conducted. The new machine can be used in a period when herbicides are not possible. Flaming could be introduced by asparagus producers as an alternative, or in addition to herbicides applied in the pre-emergence and post-harvest of spears...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of an automatic machine able to perform Variable Rate Application of cross flaming in maize fields. The VRA flaming machine was designed to remove weeds mechanically from the inter-row area and perform selective and targeted cross flaming along the crop rows. The mechanical treatment will be performed in a continuous way, even without weed presence. On the contrary, cross flaming on the maize rows is applied selective and automatically only if weeds are presence. <b>Flame</b> <b>weeding</b> is applied by means of prismatic burners fed by Liquefied Petroleum Gas, able to treat 25 cm wide strips of soil surface including crop rows. Flaming can be used selectively in maize, which can tolerate the heat released from the burners. Mechanism of morphological tolerance {{is the presence of}} many layers of the outer leaf tissue protecting the inner growing point. A low or a high LPG dose can be chosen automatically according to the weed cover percentage detected by a weed detection system. The ignition system of the VRA flaming machine is almost instantaneous and the complete flame in the burner is obtained in 0. 4 s. The machine is provided with an automatic steering system in order to avoid damaging the maize plants with the rigid tools used for mechanical weed removal. The VRA flaming machine is a new technology for precision agriculture and was designed and built within the “Robot fleets for Highly Effective Agriculture and forestry management” (RHEA) Project, funded by EU, aimed to develop a fleet of heterogeneous autonomous robot units in order to perform site-specific treatments related to crop protection in different agricultural scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Building on an {{existing}} hood design, a 4 -row flame weeder {{was developed for}} flaming in row crops like corn and soybean. <b>Flame</b> <b>weeding</b> is a thermal weed control method first researched over 100 years ago. It is a non-chemical method and has potential applications {{in a wide range}} of areas from vegetable production to urban weed control. ^ The steps in developing the 4 -row unit were: scaling up the hood design, designing a compatible torch and torch mount, developing an electronic ignition system, and finally, integrating all of the components into a complete 4 -row flamer. Design challenges included developing an unobtrusive hood assembly support system that profiled the soil surface, achieving complete vaporization of the liquid fuel, balancing flame stability and housing temperatures, and selecting a sensor for flame detection that was robust enough for harsh field environments while still providing quick response time. ^ On-farm testing was conducted throughout the design iterations of the 4 -row unit, and a fully randomized field study was conducted over two years, 2010 and 2011, to test full season weed control performance. The 4 -row unit was setup for full-flaming (FF) treatments where 100 % of the crop row was flame treated and no other weed control method was used. The field study was completed in both corn and soybean, and planting, treatments, and harvest timings matched the production timeline of an average Midwest farm. Weed control and dry matter levels, crop injury, and crop yield were the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the 4 -row unit. Weed control and crop yield in 2010 were excellent. Corn plots treated with full-flaming twice (FF 2) yielded almost 11 % higher than the weed-free control (WFC). Results in 2011 were not as good as 2010. Weed control levels for the FF treatments dropped significantly due to heavy weed pressure, and as a result, crop yields dropped. The FF 2 treatment yield in corn was 20 % lower than the WFC in 2011. Treatment results in soybean exhibited similar trends to corn. Overall, the 4 -row unit showed potential to be an excellent addition to any farmer’s current weed control methods. ...|$|E
