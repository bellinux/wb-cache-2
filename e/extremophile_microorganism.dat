Morphological, physiological, biochemical and genetic adaptations to extreme environments by these <b>extremophile</b> <b>microorganisms</b> have generated immense interest amongst astrobiologists who increasingly believe {{in the existence of}} extraterrestrial life. The evidence collected by NASA's space probe Galileo suggested the presence of liquid water and volcanic activity on Mars and Jupiter's satellite Europa.

The possibility of the existence of hypersaline alkaline lakes and evaporites confined within closed volcanic basins and impact craters on Mars, and a layer of liquid water under the ice on Europa provide sufficient 'raison d'etre' to study microorganisms in similar extreme environments on Earth, which could provide us with a model that would help establish the existence of extraterrestrial life on other planetary bodies.

40|$|International audienceThirty {{years after}} the first {{discovery}} of high-temperature submarine venting, {{the vast majority of the}} global mid-ocean ridge remains unexplored for hydrothermal activity. Of particular interest are the world's ultraslow spreading ridges that were the last to be demonstrated to host high-temperature venting but may host systems particularly relevant to prebiotic chemistry and the origins of life. Here we report evidence for previously unknown, diverse, and very deep hydrothermal vents along the ∼ 110 km long, ultraslow spreading Mid-Cayman Rise (MCR). Our data indicate that the MCR hosts at least three discrete hydrothermal sites, each representing a different type of water-rock interaction, including both mafic and ultramafic systems and, at ∼ 5, 000 m, the deepest known hydrothermal vent. Although submarine hydrothermal circulation, in which seawater percolates through and reacts with host lithologies, occurs on all mid-ocean ridges, the diversity of vent types identified here and their relative geographic isolation make the MCR unique in the oceans.

In the present work, we report for thefirst time the biosynthesis of CdS QDs by acidophilic bacteria of the Acidithiobacillus genus. CdS QDs wereobtained by exposing A. ferrooxidans, A. thiooxidans and A. caldus cells to sublethal Cd 2 +concentrations inthe presence of cysteine and glutathione. The fluorescence of cadmium-exposed cells moves from greento red with incubation time, a characteristic property of QDs associated with nanocrystals growth. Biosyn-thesized nanoparticles (NPs) display an absorption peak at 360 nm {{and a broad}} emission spectra between 450 and 650 nm when excited at 370 nm, both characteristic of CdS QDs.

40|$|A hard {{difficulty}} in Astrobiology is the precise {{definition of what}} life is. All living beings have a cellular structure, {{so it is not}} possible to have a broader concept of life hence the search for extraterrestrial life is restricted to extraterrestrial cells. Earth is an astronomical rarity because it is difficult for a planet to present liquid water on the surface. Two antagonistic bioethical principles arise: planetary protection and terraforming. Planetary protection is based on the fear of interplanetary cross-infection and possible ecological damages caused by alien living beings. Terraforming is the intention of modifying the environmental conditions of the neighbouring planets in such a way that human colonisation would be possible. The synthesis of this antagonism is ecopoiesis, a concept related to the creation of new ecosystems in other planets. Since all the multicellular biodiversity requires oxygen to survive, only <b>extremophile</b> <b>microorganisms</b> could survive in other planets. So, it could be carried out a simulation of a meteorite by taking to other planets portions of the terrestrial permafrost, or ocean or soil, so that if a single species could grow, a new ecosystem would start, as well as a new Natural History.

40|$|Studies on <b>extremophiles,</b> <b>microorganisms</b> able {{to survive}} in extreme environments, are very helpful for the {{comprehension}} of life evolution; in fact they are the unique organisms of the Earth at the origin of life.

The existence of life forms beyond the Earth requires an extension of the classical limits of life: the resistance of extremophilic organisms to harsh conditions in terms of temperature, salinity, pH, pressure, dryness, and desiccation makes these living organisms good putative candidates to assess the habitability of other planets. The ability to survive and proliferate in extreme conditions (pH, temperature, pressure, salt, and nutrients) produces a variety of biotechnologically useful molecules such as lipids, enzymes, polysaccharides, and compatible solutes that are employed in several industrial processes.

40|$|Background: Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans is an acidophilic, chemolithoautotrophic {{bacterium}} {{that has}} been successfully used in metal bioleaching. In this study, {{an analysis of the}} A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270 genome revealed the presence of three sHSP genes, Afe_ 1009, Afe_ 1437 and Afe_ 2172, that encode proteins from the HSP 20 family, a class of intracellular multimers that is especially important in <b>extremophile</b> <b>microorganisms.</b> Results: The expression of the sHSP genes was investigated in A. ferrooxidans cells submitted to a heat shock at 40 degrees C for 15, 30 and 60 minutes. After 60 minutes, the gene on locus Afe_ 1437 was about 20 -fold more highly expressed than the gene on locus Afe_ 2172. Bioinformatic and phylogenetic analyses showed that the sHSPs from A. ferrooxidans are possible non-paralogous proteins, and are regulated by the sigma(32) factor, a common transcription factor of heat shock proteins. Structural studies using homology molecular modeling indicated that the proteins encoded by Afe_ 1009 and Afe_ 1437 have a conserved alpha-crystallin domain and share similar structural features with the sHSP from Methanococcus jannaschii, suggesting that their biological assembly involves 24 molecules and resembles a hollow spherical shell. Conclusion: We conclude that the sHSPs encoded by the Afe_ 1437 and Afe_ 1009 genes are more likely to act as molecular chaperones in the A. ferrooxidans heat shock response.

40|$|Purpose: Robust {{pharmaceutical}} {{and industrial}} enzymes from <b>extremophile</b> <b>microorganisms</b> are {{main source of}} enzymes with tremendous stability under harsh conditions which make them potential tools for commercial and biotechnological applications. Methods: The genome of a Gram-positive halo-thermotolerant Bacillus sp.

We determined gene sequences for the enzymes laccase (CotA), l-asparaginase (ansA 3, ansA 1), glutamate-specific endopeptidase (blaSE), l-arabinose isomerase (araA 2), endo- 1, 4 -β mannosidase (gmuG), glutaminase (glsA), pectate lyase (pelA), cellulase (bglC 1), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ycbD) and allantoinases (pucH) in the genome of Bacillus sp. SL 1. Results: Based on the DNA sequence alignment results, six of the studied enzymes of Bacillus sp. SL- 1 showed 100 % similarity at the nucleotide level to the same genes of B. licheniformis 14580 demonstrating extensive organizational relationship between these two strains. Despite high similarities between the B. licheniformis and Bacillus sp. SL- 1 genomes, there are minor differences in the sequences of some enzyme. Approximately 30 % of the enzyme sequences revealed more than 99 % identity with some variations in nucleotides leading to amino acid substitution in protein sequences. Conclusion: Molecular characterization of this new isolate provides useful information regarding evolutionary relationship between B. subtilis and B. licheniformis species. Since, the most industrial processes are often performed in harsh conditions, enzymes from such halo-thermotolerant bacteria may provide economically and industrially appealing biocatalysts to be used under specific physicochemical situations in medical, pharmaceutical, chemical and other industries...|$|R

Chlamydomonas acidophila is an acidophile green microalga isolated by our group from Tinto River, an acidic river that flows down from the mining area in Huelva, Spain. This microalga accumulates high concentrations of lutein, a very well-known natural antioxidant. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess use of different carbon sources (CO 2, glucose, glycerol, starch, urea, and glycine) for efficient growth of and carotenoid production by C. acidophila. Our results reveal that growth of the microalga on different carbon sources resulted in different algal biomass productivities, urea being as efficient as CO 2 when used as sole carbon source (* 20 g dry biomass m– 2 day– 1). Mixotrophic growth on glucose was also efficient in terms of biomass production (* 14 g dry biomass m– 2 day– 1). In terms of carotenoid accumulation, mixotrophic growth on urea resulted in even higher productivity of carotenoids (mainly lutein, probably via a-carotene) than obtained with photoautotrophic cultures (70 % versus 65 % relative abundance of lutein, respectively). The accumulated lutein concentrations of C. acidophila reported in this work (about 10 g/kg dry weight, produced in batch systems) are among the highest reported for a microalga. Glycerol and glycine seem to enhance b-carotene biosynthesis, and when glycine is used as carbon source, zeaxanthin becomes the most accumulated carotenoid in the microalga.
