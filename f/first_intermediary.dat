50|$|Here, {{the life}} cycle of Metagonimus yokogawai will be examined, however, it should be noted Metagonimus takahashii and Metagonimus miyatai follow similar life cycle pattern. All three species are {{hermaphroditic}} and capable of self-fertilization. Embryonated eggs are passed into an aquatic environment (fresh or brackish water) each containing a fully developed larva, called a miracidium. Development can’t proceed past this stage unless the eggs are ingested by the <b>first</b> <b>intermediary</b> host, freshwater snails. After the snail host ingests the eggs, miracidia emerge and penetrate the snail’s intestines. In the snail tissue, mircadia develop into sporocysts, then rediae, and finally emerge from the snail as cercariae. The cercariae then penetrate the skin or go under the scale of a fresh or brackish water fish and encyst as metacercariae in the tissue. The type of fish that serves as secondary host varies based on location. The host then becomes infected by consuming undercooked, raw, or pickled fish containing the infectious metacercariae. The metacercariae then excyst in the small intestine of the host (human, mammal or bird), and develop into adults. In the small intestine, the adults attach to the walls and develop new eggs.|$|E

Aim: Translation and pilot testing of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) prostate cancer-specific module (PR- 25) into Hindi and Marathi. Materials and Methods: The translation procedure described by the EORTC was adopted; this comprised two forward translations of the original English questionnaire into Hindi and Marathi each with formation of <b>first</b> <b>intermediary</b> questionnaires and two back translations of the <b>first</b> <b>intermediary</b> questionnaires into English. The <b>first</b> <b>intermediary</b> questionnaires were adapted as the second intermediary questionnaires and pilot tested in ten prostate cancer patients as no modifications were suggested by the back translators. Results: Each patient, after completing the questionnaire, was interviewed by the local project coordinator who questioned them about each item in the second intermediary questionnaire. The patients were asked whether there was any difficulty in answering, confusion while answering, or difficulty in understanding the questions; whether the questions were upsetting; and if the patients themselves would have framed the question in a different way. Based on the suggestions or interpretations of this pilot testing, the necessary changes were incorporated and the final Hindi and Marathi questionnaires were formed.

Our control design is achieved in two main steps. <b>First,</b> an <b>intermediary</b> control input is designed for the translational dynamics, from which we extract the desired system attitude and thrust achieving the formation objective. Then, the torque input for the rotational dynamics of each vehicle is designed to drive the actual attitudes to the desired ones.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{empirical}} studies show {{the extent to which}} the rise of supermarkets in developing countries transforms domestic marketing channels. In many countries, the exclusion of small producers from so-called dynamic marketing channels (that is, remunerative ones) has become a concern.

Third, while market mediators' recommendations increase consumer demand in general, consumers for multiple-identity museums are negatively influenced by mediators' recommendations as they are apt to view the critics' reviews as a signal of the organization's increased commitment to a particular identity, which may be understood as going against their preference for diverse identities. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|R

40|$|Treatment-induced neuroendocrine {{transdifferentiation}} (NEtD) complicates therapies for metastatic {{prostate cancer}} (PCa). Based on evidence that PCa cells can transdifferentiate to other neuroectodermally-derived cell lineages in vitro, we proposed that NEtD requires <b>first</b> an <b>intermediary</b> reprogramming to metastable cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) of a neural class and we demonstrate that several different AR+/PSA+ PCa cell lines were efficiently reprogrammed to, maintained and propagated as CSCs by growth in androgen-free neural/neural crest (N/NC) stem medium. Such reprogrammed cells lost features of prostate differentiation; gained features of N/NC stem cells and tumor-initiating potential; were resistant to androgen signaling inhibition; and acquired an invasive phenotype in vitro and in vivo. When placed back into serum-containing mediums, reprogrammed cells could be re-differentiated to N-/NC-derived cell lineages or return {{back to an}} AR+ prostate-like state. Once returned, the AR+ cells were resistant to androgen signaling inhibition. Acute androgen deprivation or anti-androgen treatment in serum-containing medium led to the transient appearance of a sub-population of cells with similar characteristics. Finally, a 132 gene signature derived from reprogrammed PCa cell lines distinguished tumors from PCa patients with adverse outcomes. This model may explain neural manifestations of PCa associated with lethal disease. The metastable nature of the reprogrammed stem-like PCa cells suggests that cycles of PCa cell reprogramming followed by re-differentiation may support disease progression and therapeutic resistance. The ability of a gene signature from reprogrammed PCa cells to identify tumors from patients with metastasis or PCa-specific mortality implies that developmental reprogramming is linked to aggressive tumor behaviors...|$|R

In this paper we question how MRs arriving in foreign markets affect the export performance of local firms. We develop a theoretical framework that explains the mechanisms by which multinational retailers establishing outlets abroad impact the export performance of local firms and test its predictions empirically for the agri-food sector. The adopted approach draws on recent empirical evidence of the effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the retail sector and recent developments in the literature on international trade with heterogeneous firms and on trade and <b>intermediaries.</b> <b>First,</b> incoming multinational retailers may increase the overall export capacity of local firms to any foreign market via an increase in their productivity. The growing competitive pressure in the upstream sector, induced by global retail chains, drives least productive firms out of the market and the average productivity of the sector increases. In addition, retail sector FDI generates productivity gains at the firm level: local suppliers of multinational retailers benefit from the retailers' financial and technological support and become more productive in time. Thus, although the productivity threshold for exporting remains unchanged, some firms reach this threshold and start exporting, while firms above this threshold that experience productivity gains increase their volume of exports [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the main ethical aspects concerning the Romanian real estate intermediation sector. The analysis tries to evaluate the true utility of real estate agents’ services and to assess the potential negative effects of an unethical behavior for the clients. In Romanian real estate market, {{there are at least three}} issues that endanger the business ethics of <b>intermediaries.</b> <b>First,</b> as the prices increase very fast, the transactions involve larger and larger amounts of money that attract entrepreneurs with weak intrinsic ethical standards. Very often, they fail to understand the instrumental value of business ethics too. Thus, instead of building a reputation in the market they prefer an immediate gain. Secondly, the real estate brokerage is poorly regulated in Romania. According to the motto “if not forbidden, it's permitted”, the real estate agents adopted very lax ethical standards. The third factor is the deficit of public information regarding the real estate market and the activity of real estate agents. The press usually reproduces the views of leading real estate agents, instead of providing authentic investigations of their services. The main conclusion is that there is evidence that the Romanian real estate agents try to maximize their profits by manipulating the economic environment rather than providing valuable services for their clients. business ethics, real estate agent, rent-seeking, reservation price, moral hazard...|$|R

How astonishing it is to find is that this important issue is sparsely covered in the literature. In this study, we investigate the causes and consequences of the decisions that are made by the IPO reviewing committee. From a unique dataset provided by the Taiwan Stock Exchange, {{we find that the}} firms that are approved for listing are associated with better financial performance measures and are larger in equity size prior to their applications. However, whether an IPO firm is unanimously approved by the committee depends on whether the firm’s associated auditor changes or gives a non-unqualified report. In addition, electronics firms that are allowed favorable listing terms are prone to being approved, but not unanimously so. We find that the voting outcome provides a discernable effect in that the firms in the unanimously approved group are associated with higher financial performance measures (ROE, ROA, EPS, and P/E) than are the firms in the non-unanimously approved group, with the differences being more significant in the two years after the IPO. The overall results support the notion that the IPO reviewing committee provides a surveillance function that is effective in assuring the quality of an IPO firm...|$|R
40|$|We {{modify the}} basic Gehrig (1993) model. In this model, {{individual}} agents are either buyers or sellers. They can choose between joining the search market, joining the monopolistic intermediary or remaining inactive. In the search market, agents are randomly matched {{and the price}} at which exchange takes place is set bilaterally. If agents join the intermediary, buyers have to pay an ask price set in advance by the intermediary. Likewise, if sellers decide to deal through the intermediary, they get the bid price set by the intermediary. As Gehrig shows, this model has an equilibrium in which the search market and the market of the monopolistic intermediary are simultaneously open. The intermediary makes positive profits because he trades at a positive ask-bid spread, and the set of individual agents is tripartite: High valuation buyers and low cost sellers deal through the intermediary, buyers and sellers with average valuations and average costs are active in the search market, and low valuation buyers and high cost sellers remain inactive. We modify this basic model by imposing a sequential structure. We assume that the monopolistic <b>intermediary</b> <b>first</b> has to buy the good from sellers on the input market before he can sell it to buyers on the output market.

Preparation for the course included analysis of historical climate information, as well as training of staff from the Tanzania Meteorological Agency in downscaling using the Climate Prediction Tool (CPT). The ensuing training course for intermediaries covered the Participatory Integrated Climate Services for Agriculture (PICSA) approach. This aimed to equip agricultural extension field staff to provide local historical climate information, seasonal and sub-seasonal forecasts (seamless forecasts) together with crop and livelihood information and to facilitate use of participatory decision making tools by smallholder farmers, in order to enhance farm and field-level decision making for resilience and food security. Training included a strong practical component. At the end of the training course agricultural extension officers and NGO staff developed plans for implementation in the locations that they work. Formal and informal feedback from participants was very positive. From this first training several improvements to feed into subsequent training in Tanzania and Malawi were identified and recommendations are made. These include: how to ensure that climate information for districts is analysed well in advance; appropriate crop and livestock management options are identified to cover variation within each district; climatic variability is adequately addressed within districts; and the potential benefits of CPT downscaled forecasting are fully explored...|$|R

Identificadas as diferenças entre as propostas daqueles autores quanto ao tratamento destas questões serão apresentadas brevemente algumas contribuições que podem ter sido provenientes das obras de Aristóteles, visando esclarecer a origem do tratamento a estes temas por Ibn Gabirol. Acreditamos que a obra de Ibn Gabirol deve ser estendida inserida em seu contexto histórico-filosófico, que primava por ver as doutrinas de Platão e Aristóteles, não como conflitantes, mas como complementares, bem como no sentido de sua compatibilização com o criacionismo abrahâmico que, no caso, obedece ao primado judaíco da dessemelhança radical entre Deus e a criação.
