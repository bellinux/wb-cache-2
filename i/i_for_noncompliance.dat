40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that a surprisingly large fraction of firms comply with pollution emission standards even though expected penalties <b>for</b> <b>noncompliance</b> are low. We offer an explanation of this puzzle by extending the standard model of enforcement to include a self-reporting requirement and enforcement power. These extensions are enough to challenge the conventional result that higher fines lead to higher compliance rates. We find that under plausible conditions, higher compliance rates are achieved with lower fines <b>for</b> <b>noncompliance</b> {{and the cost of}} enforcing a given level of aggregate pollution is minimized by setting the fine <b>for</b> <b>noncompliance</b> equal to zero. © 1999 Elsevier Science S.

40|$|Excerpt] Until recently, Australian {{disability}} discrimination law {{was similar}} to that of the United States and much of the rest of the world: it defined disability relatively narrowly, its penalties <b>for</b> <b>noncompliance</b> were relatively paltry, and it depended on enforcement of lawsuits brought by aggrieved private citizens. In 2009, however, Australia adopted the Fair Work Act 2009 (FW Act). The FW Act defined disability much more broadly, increased substantially the penalties <b>for</b> <b>noncompliance,</b> and created a state institution to enforce disability rights. This article analyses the FW Act, compares it to the workplace disability law in the United States, and argues that the FW Act is a transformational development in the struggle to achieve workplace equality and is an approach that should attract significant international interest...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the features of}} an optimal regulatory policy composed of pollution standards and probabilities of inspection to verify firms' behavior, where fines <b>for</b> <b>noncompliance</b> depend {{on the degree of}} violation. We find that the optimal policy can entail either compliance or noncompliance with the enviromental standards, the latter being more plausible when monitoring costs are high and, surprisingly, when fines <b>for</b> <b>noncompliance</b> are also high. In the event the planner has perfect information about the firns, we find that, whe the optimal policy entails noncompliance, the optimal standard is always equal to zero, suggesting the superiority of probabilistic environmental taxes versus positive standards. However this is no longer true when the planner has incomplete information about the regulated agents. standard-setting; costly inspection; convex fines;...|$|R

40|$|Background National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) {{guideline}} compliance {{for breast}} cancer was determined in a breast center. Methods A retrospective study of 200 new breast cancer patients seen in 2004 was performed.

The most common reasons <b>for</b> <b>noncompliance</b> were partial breast radiation, no radiation, limited life expectancy, and patient choice to defer systemic treatment. Conclusions The investigation of quality of breast cancer care requires measurement of compliance and reasons <b>for</b> <b>noncompliance</b> with established guidelines. A review that focuses only on percentage compliance {{has the potential to}} penalize institutions that (1) practice informed consent detailing absolute risks of survival with and without systemic therapy, (2) practice evidence-based medicine before the standardized guideline is changed to reflect it, and (3) serve populations with limited life expectancy...|$|R
