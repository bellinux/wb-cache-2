40|$|Among the {{possible}} <b>decay</b> <b>modes</b> of Higgs particles into supersymmetric states, neutralino and chargino decays play a prominent rôle. The experimental opportunities of observing such <b>decay</b> <b>modes</b> at LEP 2 and at future e + e − linear colliders are analyzed within {{the frame of}} the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model. For heavy Higgs particles, the chargino/neutralino <b>decay</b> <b>modes</b> can be very important, while only a small window is open for the lightest CP–even Higgs particle. If charginos/neutralinos are found at LEP 2, such <b>decay</b> <b>modes</b> can be searched for in a small area of the parameter space, and invisible decays may reduce the exclusion limits of the lightest CP-even Higgs particle slightly; if charginos/neutralinos are not found at LEP 2 in direct searches, the Higgs search will not be affected by the SUSY particle sector...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{spectral}} properties of a diffusion process {{taking place on}} the Internet network focusing on the slowest <b>decaying</b> <b>modes.</b> These modes allow us to identify an underlying modular structure of the Internet roughly corresponding to individual countries. For instance in the slowest <b>decaying</b> <b>mode</b> the diffusion current flows from Russia towards US military sites. These two regions thus constitute the extreme edges of the Internet. Quantitatively the modular structure of the Internet manifests itself in approximately 10 times larger participation ratio of its slow <b>decaying</b> <b>modes</b> compared to the null model - a random scale-free network. We propose to use the fraction of nodes participating in slow <b>decaying</b> <b>modes</b> as a general measure of the modularity of a network. For the 100 slowest <b>decaying</b> <b>modes</b> of the Internet we measured this fraction to be around 30 %. Finally we suggest, {{that the degree of}} isolation of an individual module can be assessed by comparing its participation in different diffusion modes. Using the proportionality of response as a criterion we find that the independent module approximation works well for the Internet. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
