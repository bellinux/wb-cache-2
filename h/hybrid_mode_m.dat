40|$|Intracellular {{recordings}} of spontaneous miniature end-plate potentials (m. e. p. p. s) in muscles from adult CBF- 1 mice revealed {{a population of}} muscle fibres in which the amplitude distribution of m. e. p. p. s was bimodal. The large <b>mode</b> <b>m.</b> e. p. p. s {{were similar to those}} from fibres having unimodal amplitude distributions and the small <b>mode</b> <b>m.</b> e. p. p. s were about one-half to one-quarter the amplitude of the large mode. In five diverse muscle groups (extensor digitorum communis, gluteus maximus, diaphragm, extensor digitorum longus, and soleus) from mice 10 - 12 or 31 months of age, bimodal m. e. p. p. amplitude distributions were present in about 20 % of fibres sampled. In the common bimodal distribution (type 1), the rise times of small <b>mode</b> <b>m.</b> e. p. p. s were similar to those of large <b>mode</b> <b>m.</b> e. p. p. s. A rare class of small <b>mode</b> <b>m.</b> e. p. p. s (type 2) having long rise times was also observed. Amplitudes and half-decay times of type 1 small <b>mode</b> <b>m.</b> e. p. p. s increased in the presence of an anticholinesterase (edrophonium). Increasing extracellular potassium concentration led to an increase in large <b>mode</b> <b>m.</b> e. p. p. frequency but had more variable effects on small mode frequency. In the few cases available for study, type 2 small <b>mode</b> <b>m.</b> e. p. p. s disappeared after addition of edrophonium or increased potassium. When the extracellular calcium/magnesium ratio was reduced, large mode but not small <b>mode</b> <b>m.</b> e. p. p. frequency decreased. In almost all muscle fibres in which end-plate potentials (e. p. p. s) were evoked by nerve stimulation at 20 Hz in low calcium/high magnesium solution, small mode e. p. p. s similar to small <b>mode</b> <b>m.</b> e. p. p. s appeared during 'failures' of large <b>mode</b> <b>m.</b> e. p. p. s. Also, in twelve out of fifteen fibres which had unimodal m. e. p. p. amplitude distributions, small mode e. p. p. s appeared which were similar in amplitude to small <b>mode</b> <b>m.</b> e. p. p. s in fibres with type 1 bimodal m. e. p. p. s. Thus, if both spontaneous and evoked potentials are included, small <b>mode</b> <b>m.</b> e. p. p. s are present at most CBF- 1 mouse adult neuromuscular junctions independent of muscle type or animal age. Small and large <b>mode</b> <b>m.</b> e. p. p. s differ in certain responses but both are evoked by nerve stimulation at physiological frequencies and therefore participate in normal neuromuscular synaptic activity. The possible origin of small <b>mode</b> <b>m.</b> e. p. p. s is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The <b>hybrid</b> <b>mode</b> {{operation}} for {{the reduction of}} plasma drops is being investigated. This report discusses the results obtained from two molybdenum emitter converters. One converter had a molybdenum collector {{and the other a}} nickel collector. The molybdenum collector converter was operated in a <b>hybrid</b> <b>mode</b> (at an interelectrode distance of 1. 7 mm) and produced a minimum barrier index of 1. 96 eV at an emitter temperature of 1500 K. The arc drop was calculated to be 0. 14 eV, using the published results for a molybdenum collector. On the other hand, the nickel collector converter was operated in a conventional ignited mode (at an interelectrode distance of 0. 5 mm) and produced a minimum barrier index of 2. 1 eV at an emitter temperature of 1700 K. It is tentatively concluded that a large-gap operation of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>mode</b> converter permits the diffusion of cesium ions to a distance in the order of one millimeter for an effective neutralization of electron space charge. By employing a low work function collector (1. 55 eV) in a <b>hybrid</b> <b>mode</b> converter with an arc drop of 0. 14 eV, it appears that a barrier index as low as 1. 69 eV could be achieved...|$|R
