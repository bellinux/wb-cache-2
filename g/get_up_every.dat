He worked 18- to 20-hour days without break and was apparently absent of any leisure activities. [...] "There was no more powerful majority leader in American history," [...] biographer Robert Dallek writes. Dallek stated that Johnson had biographies on all the Senators, knew what their ambitions, hopes, and tastes were {{and used it to}} his advantage in securing votes. Another Johnson biographer noted, [...] "He could <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>every</b> day and learn what their fears, their desires, their wishes, their wants were and he could then manipulate, dominate, persuade and cajole them." [...] At [...] tall, Johnson had his own particular brand of persuasion, known as [...] "The Johnson Treatment". A contemporary writes, [...] "It was an incredible blend of badgering, cajolery, reminders of past favors, promises of future favors, predictions of gloom if something doesn't happen. When that man started to work on you, all of a sudden, you just felt that you were standing under a waterfall and the stuff was pouring on you." ...|$|E

I <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>every</b> morning and see the whole creation groaning and travailing in pain, as St. Paul says, and yet there am I, trafficking in glittering splendours with wealthy women and titled libertines, and pandering to the meanest vanities--I, who have health and strength enough for anything. I have been troubled in my mind about it all the year, and the end is that I cannot do it any more." ...|$|E

60|$|Now, {{this gentleman}} had various endearing appellations among his {{intimate}} friends. By some {{he was called}} 'a country gentleman of the true school,' by some 'a fine old country gentleman,' by some 'a sporting gentleman,' by some 'a thorough-bred Englishman,' by some 'a genuine John Bull;' but they all agreed in one respect, and that was, {{that it was a}} pity there were not more like him, and that because there were not, the country was going to rack and ruin every day. He was in the commission of the peace, and could write his name almost legibly; but his greatest qualifications were, that he was more severe with poachers, was a better shot, a harder rider, had better horses, kept better dogs, could eat more solid food, drink more strong wine, go to bed every night more drunk and <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>every</b> morning more sober, than any man in the county. In knowledge of horseflesh he was almost equal to a farrier, in stable learning he surpassed his own head groom, and in gluttony not a pig on his estate was a match for him. He had no seat in Parliament himself, but he was extremely patriotic, and usually drove his voters up to the poll with his own hands. He was warmly attached to church and state, and never appointed to the living in his gift any but a three-bottle man and a first-rate fox-hunter. He mistrusted the honesty of all poor people who could read and write, and had a secret jealousy of his own wife (a young lady whom he had married for what his friends called 'the good old English reason,' that her father's property adjoined his own) for possessing those accomplishments in a greater degree than himself. In short, Barnaby being an idiot, and Grip a creature of mere brute instinct, it would be very hard to say what this gentleman was.|$|E

Rossi supports repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. He has also criticized Murray for her support for earmarks. In response, Murray said, [...] "You bet that seniority and leadership has a big {{thing to do with}} it, but the other part of it is, I <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>every</b> day and I work hard and I believe in this and I am going to continue fighting for the community I represent." ...|$|E

When the Post Office burns down in Going Postal Moist goes back into the burning Post Office to save Mr. Tiddles. Ultimately Mr. Tiddles and Moist are saved by the diligent, unrelenting firefighting efforts of the city's golems, many of them Post Office employees themselves.

Implied, but not stated, is that he could just move the chair once and leave it in the new, non-obstructing position.|$|E

Siedleck's high school basketball coach later recalled that Siedlecki {{was not a good}} shooter, but had great vision as the team's point guard: [...] "He could see things unfold before they happened. Some people are born with that ability to see things. Jack was." [...] The same coach recalled Siedlecki's performance as tailback in a game against future NFL linebacker, Ted Jornov:"Jack kept taking these unmerciful poundings from Jornov.

One of the main goals of the “Dreamkiller” campaign is to spread a feeling of normalcy, to reassure viewers that their fears do not place them in a minority.A potential partnership with UCLA’s Counseling Center fell through, but Pirotta and Deak pursued connections with other psychological services offices nationwide, as well as celebrities and well-known figures.“When you hear celebrities talking about their fears, you feel a little more normal,” Pirotta said.“There are no shortcuts in life - that’s one of the messages in the movie - sometimes {{you just have to be}} strong and <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>every</b> time you fall, and at the end the only way to defeat fear is to be brave,” Pirotta said.|$|E
