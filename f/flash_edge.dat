40|$|Responses of parafoveal macaque {{ganglion}} {{cells were}} measured {{as a function}} of the contrast and position of an <b>edge</b> <b>flashed</b> within their receptive fields. The goal was to determine the ability of different cell types to signal edge location. For comparison, parafoveal vernier thresholds of human observers were measured with pairs of <b>flashed</b> <b>edges.</b> Cells of the magnocellular (MC-) pathway gave larger responses than cells of the parvocellular (PC-) pathway. Neurometric analyses comparing a cell's response at different edge positions were performed. The positional signal from single MC-pathway cells was more precise than from PC-pathway cells, especially at lower contrasts. In a second analysis, based on the neurophysiological results, responses from a matrix of ganglion cells were generated. Using a simple model, vernier performance expected from such a matrix was predicted {{as a function of}} edge length and contrast. Again, the MC-pathway gave a more precise positional signal than the PC-pathway despite the latter's numerical advantage. At contrasts of 20 and below, only the MC-pathway would appear capable of supporting vernier performance with our stimuli. At higher contrasts either the MC- or PC-pathway could provide an adequate signal...|$|R

We successfully confirmed that this structure using fringing field effect provides good program characteristics showing sufficient threshold voltage (VT) margin by technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation. From the simulation results, {{we expect that}} program speed characteristics of proposed structure have competitive compared to other 3 D NAND flash structure. Moreover, {{it is estimated that}} this structural feature using edge fringing field effect gives better design scalability compared to the conventional 3 D NAND flash structures by scaling of the hole size for the vertical channel. As a result, the proposed structure is one of the candidates of Terabit 3 D vertical NAND flash cell with lower bit cost and design scalability.

50|$|One theory {{suggests}} that temporal-frequency processing in the magnocellular pathway, an anatomical pathway that originates in the retina, goes through the lateral geniculate nucleus, and ends in the primary visual cortex, may {{be connected to the}} appearance of this illusion (Skottun and Skoyles debated this link in 2006). The magnocellular pathway is contrast-sensitive, sensitive to motion, and also sensitive to <b>flashing</b> black-to-white <b>edges.</b> Livingstone and Hubel looked at lateral geniculate cells in both the magno- and parvocellular layers, and found responses to luminance contrasts to be much stronger in magnocellular cells. These cells also had better spatial and temporal resolution. Additionally, the magnocelluar pathway is activated more by peripheral vision, in contrast to the parvocelluar pathway, which is activated more by central vision. Rogers-Ramachandran and Ramachandran tested whether or not this preference for peripheral stimuli in the magnocellular cells would have an effect on phantom contour perception. As was predicted, sparsely spaced objects, which degrade the perception of the contours in central vision, were more easily perceived when subjects adjusted their fixation from 0 to 5 degrees eccentricity. This supports the idea that magnocellular cells are responsible for phantom contour perception under such conditions.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} a dose reduction in contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) by comparing the three latest generations of Siemens CT scanners used in clinical practice. We analyzed the amount of radiation used with filtered back projection (FBP) and an iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithm to yield the same image quality. Furthermore, the influence on the radiation dose of the most recent integrated circuit detector (ICD; Stellar detector, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS 136 Patients were included. Scan parameters were set to a thorax routine: SOMATOM Sensation 64 (FBP), SOMATOM Definition Flash (IR), and SOMATOM Definition Edge (ICD and IR). Tube current was set constantly to the reference level of 100 mA automated tube current modulation using reference milliamperes. Care kV was used on the <b>Flash</b> and <b>Edge</b> scanner, while tube potential was individually selected between 100 and 140 kVp by the medical technologists at the SOMATOM Sensation. Quality assessment was performed on soft-tissue kernel reconstruction. Dose was represented by the dose length product. RESULTS Dose-length product (DLP) with FBP for the average chest CT was 308 mGy*cm ± 99. 6. In contrast, the DLP for the chest CT with IR algorithm was 196. 8 mGy*cm ± 68. 8 (P = 0. 0001).

40|$|Blurred edges appear sharper {{in motion}} {{than when they}} are stationary. We {{proposed}} a model of this motion sharpening that invokes a local, nonlinear contrast transducer function (Hammett et al, 1998 Vision Research 38 2099 - 2108). Response saturation in the transducer compresses or 'clips' the input spatial waveform, rendering the edges as sharper. To explain the increasing distortion of drifting edges at higher speeds, the degree of nonlinearity must increase with speed or temporal frequency. A dynamic contrast gain control before the transducer can account for both the speed dependence and approximate contrast invariance of motion sharpening (Hammett et al, 2003 Vision Research, in press). We show here that this model also predicts perceived sharpening of briefly <b>flashed</b> and flickering <b>edges,</b> and we show that the model can account fairly well for experimental data from all three modes of presentation (motion, flash, and flicker). At moderate durations and lower temporal frequencies the gain control attenuates the input signal, thus protecting it from later compression by the transducer. The gain control is somewhat sluggish, and so it suffers both a slow onset, and loss of power at high temporal frequencies. Consequently, brief presentations and high temporal frequencies of drift and flicker are less protected from distortion, and show greater perceptual sharpening...|$|R

Pitting and fretting occurred equally frequently in both groups whilst no fatigue cracks were noted in any of the 108 instruments.

40|$|High speed forming is a {{traditional}} and long known process for the forming, joining and plating of blanks. The advantages are in general the high forming velocity and the possibility to handle materials, {{which could not be}} treated by conventional processes The economic criteria for this technique are single piece or small lot production, pieces too large for available presses and the avoidance of a thermal treatment. An additional advantage of the process is the strain hardening of the work piece during the process. Scope of this work was the application of pyrotechnic gas generators in a hydro forming kind of process and to extend the technology for cutting processes. Experiments are described, which use gas generator materials as a driving force in a deep drawing and a cutting process. During the work a new gas generator formulation was developed, which showed a minimal slag formation and moderate combustion temperature. Interior ballistic behaviour and combustion temperature were characterized. Materials tested were steel, stainless steel and aluminium with different thicknesses. The results show, that gas generators are a suitable mean for deep drawing applications. The performance of the gas generator process is directly comparable to the hydro forming process, but the time for the drawing cycle is much faster with the new method.

40|$|Objective of {{the work}} could be found out primarily, whether the refraktive a {{foldable}} multi-focal lens of the type ARRAY SA 40 N meets the expectations of patients and Ophthalmologen, like eyesight nearby and distance at far-reaching glasses independence. At the same time, it should be checked how far prejudices are justified conditionally {{by the quality of}} earlier multi-focal lens generations such as a dazzling sensitiveness increased post-operatively and perception of visual phenomena. As a comparison group patients were consulted by the type Allergan SI 40 nb to this with Monofokallinsen. The two models are foldable intraocular back chamber lenses of silicone material breaking highly with PMMA-Haptik, a complete diameter of 13 mm and a visual diameter of 6 mm. The multi-focal lenses of the type ARRAY SA 40 N are refraktive silicone multi-focal lenses. They stand out wavy surface of the visual part due to an asphärische. At first the extraction of the patient data was carried out from the operation register of the eye hospital Berlin-Marzahn of the period of 1997 - 2001. The data of the medical files were been in a recording bend and encoded with answers of the questionnaires in a database. In the questionnaire these became post-operative glasses carrying behaviors, light sensations, dazzling sensitiveness as well as includes subjective patient satisfaction. 34 patients got bilateral and 45 patients a multi-focal lens, 56 patients from the consecutively select patients a Monofokallinse unilaterally. The after-control and follow-up treatment was generally carried out with the set up eye specialists. 7. 2 months after the first implantation found a first later check-up of the clinic instead of, a further with 10 patients (17 eyes) after 4. 14 years in connection with the implantation of the art lens at the partner eye on average. The examination on hand shows that the Visus after implantation of the multi-focal lens Array SA 40 N has improved with almost all patients. At the multi-focal lens patients 66. 07 % on the first post-operative day reached an approaching keenness of sight of Nieden 1 and 58. 7 % a keenness of sight of at least 1. 0 in the distance without an additional correction. The implantation of this multi-focal lens led to a good post-operative unkorrigierten Fernvisus comparably with it of Monofokallinsen. Better results were obtained in the local area as expected as the examination points. The patient interview has shown {{that the majority of the}} patients is satisfied with the operation result. Although light sensations which are found disturbing of most patients as little, however, appear post-operatively. The perception of visual phenomena depends on the objective refraction, the Astigma-tismus, the IOL design, the pupil distance and the patient age. The post-operative increase of the dazzling sensitiveness as well as the perception of visual side-effects are negligible for the patient at corresponding clearing up and it therefore turns out that the prejudices are not justified opposite the multi-focal lens of the type ARRAY SA 40 N unlike the multi-focal lenses of earlier generation. The multi-focal intraocular lens used here increases the quality of the visual rehabilitation of the patients after cataract extraction by reducing the necessity of an additional glasses correction. By the use of foldable intraocular lenses and with that small cut technology the post-operative astigmatism is negligible. The advantages of the multi-focal lenses get noticeable for many patients particularly after a bilateral implantation as ours covers examination. The majority of the multi-focal lens straps uses primarily or reading post-operative glasses at longer approaching work. The far zones of ARRAY SA 40 N can be used by reading-glasses for the proximity; what particularly when reading longer than pleasant is found. The majority of the patients has also more than four year after implantation of the multi-focal lens a good Fern and also Nahvisus without correction. They get by largely without glasses, have a good contrast sensitiveness and feel neither increased dazzling nor visual phenomena strongly impaired. Our case idea and also other publications show that the implantation of multi-focal lenses is possible also with younger patients, particularly children. The careful pre-operative patient selection as well as a detailed patient clearing up also on the part of the introducing and giving further treatment eye specialists are imperative for a good result. The patient should know that despite an ideal bio metric objective, a complete renunciation of glasses cannot be always reached. It a certain degree of tolerance of the dazzling phenomena known, appearing post-operatively should also from the patient and halo as well as the contrast perception reduced be found. Extremely critical patients should be warned against multi-focal lenses under circumstances. To be able to obtain a correct visual effect of the lens, a symmetrical Kapselsackfixation is imperative from the surgeon. Moreover, astigmatism as low as possible and post-operative Emmetropie have to be striven which is reached by the use of foldable MIOL and an exact biometrics. The stake of the IOL Masters has proved itself very much. The foldable multi-focal lens ARRAY SA 40 N used by us here has several focal lengths and provides with a sharp eyesight in a different distance by the fluent transition of 5 refraktiven zones. At the time of the assessment it was the only multi-focal lens with FDA admission. Further operative proceedings for the correction of the presbyopia which partly are in the experimental stage still are akkommodierende intraocular lenses, magnetically movable intraocular lenses or the replacement of the cloudy lens by "Lens refilling". The so-called akkommodativen lenses are not, however, an actual alternative to the multi-focal lens due to the too low accommodation breadth at present. The method of the "Lens refilling" is still immature by the inaccurate precomputation of the lens size, the bend radii and the refracting power. The sum of our results and the literature enquiry show that the multi-focal lens used by us is a good alternative to the Monofokallinse under strict consideration of the selection criteria which contributes to the improvement on the quality of life. The newest generation of multi-focal lenses seems to compensate for the known disadvantages by the additional asphärische surface, the amplified approaching part of+ 4. 0 diopters, the dependence on pupildiameter lenweitenunabhängikeit, the sharp optics <b>edge,</b> <b>flashing</b> blue light filter as well as apodisierung in a certain measure...|$|R
