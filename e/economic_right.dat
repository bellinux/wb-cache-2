The second category is called copyrights related to personality.

[...] In 2004, Justice Blair, writing for the Ontario Court of Appeal in Mussani v.

The thrust of this dissertation is to examine how the Commission has in practice exercised its functions to promote and protect social and <b>economic</b> <b>rights</b> in light of a challenging setting to define social and <b>economic</b> <b>rights</b> mandate. It assesses the Commission’s strengths and weaknesses in enforcing social and <b>economic</b> <b>rights</b> by reviewing its various promotional and protection undertakings and its overall modus operandi. Considering its existing practice, it is argued that the Commission’s voice is less prominent in the field of social and <b>economic</b> <b>rights</b> as it paid little attention to them compared to civil and political rights. It also is maintained that both external factors (such as lack of strong and legally enforceable constitutional provisions on social and <b>economic</b> <b>rights,</b> and the local context of the Commission’s establishment) and internal factors (such as limitations to the Commission’s institutional capacity and organizational set up) have thwarted the Commission from giving a reasonable degree of attention to social and <b>economic</b> <b>rights.</b> The dissertation suggests areas of institutional, organizational and legal reforms to enhance the Commission’s effectiveness in implementing its mandated functions to promote and protect social and <b>economic</b> <b>rights...</b>|$|R

It examines if there is a substantial reason for the difference in treatment, and if the discriminatory law has a substantial relationship to that reason. For example, the Court has asked: [...] "Does the distinction made by Montana between residents and nonresidents in establishing access to elk hunting threaten a basic right in a way that offends the Privileges and Immunities Clause?" [...] See Baldwin v. Fish and Game Commission of Montana [...] The court held it did not, because hunting is a recreational sport, which is outside the fundamental rights protected by the Constitution. If the court had found that recreation and sports were fundamental rights, it would have still had to examine whether the state had a compelling interest (protecting elk herds from being over-hunted), and whether the law was designed to address that problem.|$|E
