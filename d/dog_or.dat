5|$|Fragment of a Crucifixion is a 1950 canvas by the Irish-born, English figurative painter Francis Bacon, {{housed in}} the Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven. The {{painting}} shows two animals engaged in brutal struggle. The upper figure, which may be a <b>dog</b> <b>or</b> a cat, crouches over a chimera and is {{at the point of}} kill. It stoops on the horizontal beam of a T-shaped structure, which may signify Christ's cross. The painting contains thinly sketched passer-by figures, who seem oblivious to the central drama.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} vampiric {{generation}} were many and varied in original folklore. In Slavic and Chinese traditions, any corpse that was jumped over by an animal, particularly a <b>dog</b> <b>or</b> a cat, was feared {{to become one}} of the undead. A body with a wound that had not been treated with boiling water was also at risk. In Russian folklore, vampires were said to have once been witches or people who had rebelled against the Russian Orthodox Church while they were alive.|$|E

5|$|Bears {{have small}} rounded ears {{so as to}} {{minimise}} heat loss, but neither their hearing or sight are particularly acute. Unlike many other carnivorans they have colour vision, perhaps to help them distinguish ripe nuts and fruits. They are unique among carnivorans in not having touch-sensitive whiskers on the muzzle; however, they have an excellent sense of smell, better {{than that of the}} <b>dog,</b> <b>or</b> possibly any other mammal. They use smell for signalling to each other (either to warn off rivals or detect mates) and for finding food. Smell is the principal sense used by bears to locate most of their food, and they have excellent memories which helps them to relocate places where they have found food before.|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{experiments}} to study evolution and genetics. Laboratory mice, flies, fish, and worms are inbred through many generations to create strains with defined characteristics. These provide animals of a known genetic background, {{an important tool}} for genetic analyses. Larger mammals are rarely bred specifically for such studies due to their slow rate of reproduction, though some scientists take advantage of inbred domesticated animals, such as <b>dog</b> <b>or</b> cattle breeds, for comparative purposes. Scientists studying how animals evolve use many animal species to see how variations in where and how an organism lives (their niche) produce adaptations in their physiology and morphology. As an example, sticklebacks are now being used to study how many and which types of mutations are selected to produce adaptations in animals' morphology during the evolution of new species.|$|E
5|$|Other regular {{characters}} include Fenton Fuscus, a bat {{who went}} to high school and university with Lindesfarne, to whom he is now married and have a hedgehog-bat hybrid daughter, Turvy; Fiona Fennec, a half-red, half-Fennec fox vixen who is Rudy's girlfriend; George Fennec, Fiona's father who is married to Danielle, a sister of Kevin, and have a human son, Francis (the first of its kind in this world)since Danielle herself was human once; and Ralph Dewclaw, Kell's brother who was originally hostile to Kevin, but now accepts the rabbit as family after several unsuccessful hunting attempts. He now works for Kevin as part of Hare-Link and is married to George's former wife Martha. Another is Daisy, a daisy plant made intelligent by the GBC. It lives with the Dewclaws as a pet, having the same intelligence as a <b>dog</b> <b>or</b> cat in our world.|$|E

5000|$|A kennel is a {{structure}} <b>or</b> shelter for <b>dogs</b> <b>or</b> cats. Used in the plural, the kennels, the term means any building, collection of buildings or a property in which <b>dogs</b> <b>or</b> cats are housed, maintained, and (though not in all cases) bred. A kennel {{can be made}} out of various materials, the most popular being wood and canvas.|$|R

5|$|The upper {{creature}} {{may be a}} <b>dog</b> <b>or</b> a cat. Blood {{pours out}} of its mouth onto the head and body of its prey, a chimera rendered as owl-like with human facial characteristics. The prey unsuccessfully struggles to flee from its captor. The lower figure's human aspect is most notable {{in the details of}} its mouth and genitalia. Both figures are positioned in the centre foreground of the canvas, and are each mutilated and covered in blood, their physical discomfort contrasted against the flat, neutral background typical of Bacon's paintings. The figures exhibit many elements found in his early work, noticeably the expressive broad strokes set against the tightness of the flat, nondescript background. The link with the biblical Crucifixion is made through the raised arms of the lower creature, and the T-shaped cross.|$|E

25|$|Given {{the proper}} {{environment}} and care, a Komondor is a responsible, loving dog. They are devoted and calm without being sluggish. As in any breed, there {{is quite a}} range of personalities, so your needs should be outlined clearly to your breeder. An experienced breeder can try to identify that personality which would be happier as an independent livestock <b>dog,</b> <b>or</b> that which wants more to please and would make a good obedience <b>dog</b> <b>or</b> family pet. Adolescence can be marked by changes in a Komondor's temperament, eating habits, trainability and general attitude.|$|E
25|$|Animal bites - {{adequate}} antibiotic {{cover is}} required after even minor <b>dog</b> <b>or</b> other animal bites.

25|$|Pharaoh Hounds tend {{to weigh}} up to 45-55 pounds on average. Weight {{depends on the}} sex of the <b>dog,</b> <b>or</b> its eating habits.
