5|$|Burch's {{style has}} been {{described}} as preppy-boho and preppy-bohemian luxe, and is associated with her T-logo medallion. Known for being easy to wear and versatile, her styles are popular with women of all ages, including the viewers and fans of the television show Gossip Girl, where they were often featured. In 2007, there were wait lists to buy Tory Burch fashions, which are known for color and print and often pay homage to styles of the 1960s and 1970s. Burch named <b>her</b> <b>line</b> of Reva ballerina flats after her mother.|$|E
5|$|The {{preceding}} {{section of}} the poem had dealt at some length with the extended family of Porthaon's sister Demodice, tracing <b>her</b> <b>line</b> down to the generation following the Trojan War. Here ē' hoiai (plural) is used to jump backwards in order to complete {{the account of the}} descendants of Porthaon and Demodice's father Agenor by covering the son's family. Elsewhere the formula is used in transitions to more distant branches. The Ehoie of Mestra, for example, ultimately serves to reintroduce the family of Sisyphus, Mestra's great-granduncle who hoped to win her as bride for his son Glaucus. Although that marriage does not take place, the descendants of Sisyphus are soon presented.|$|E

50|$|In reality, West wore an {{earpiece}} so director Ken Hughes {{could feed}} <b>her</b> <b>lines.</b> Hughes had rewritten {{most of the}} dialogue because he and West both felt the script was weak. As a result, West {{had no time to}} study the script to memorize <b>her</b> <b>lines.</b> Hughes has repeatedly debunked the urban legend that West's earpiece picked up police signals and that West repeated them.|$|R
5|$|Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is an action-adventure puzzle-platformer. The player {{controls}} the main protagonist, an unnamed Prince from a kingdom in Persia. Environments are seen through a controllable third-person view. The camera's view changes to different positions triggered by entering certain areas or performing actions. The Prince {{can be moved}} in all directions, and {{he is able to}} manipulate large objects such as blocks and levers connected to mechanisms. His health and power metre are represented in the top left-hand corner of the screen. The Prince restores health by drinking water from pools and fountains. Collecting Sands increases the Prince's power, and drinking from hidden magic fountains increases the Prince's maximum health. During several points in the game, the Prince is assisted by his companion Farah, who fires a bow at enemies, though her arrows can also hit the Prince if he strays into <b>her</b> <b>line</b> of fire. Monsters will attack her, and if she is killed, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|Producers of {{the network}} version {{included}} Hampton, Rubino, Leslie Fuller, Nikki Webber, and Terrence McDonnell. For its first two seasons the syndicated version had Deirdre Cossman for its managing producer, then Dennis F. McMahon became producer {{for the next two}} seasons (joined by Dominique Bruballa as his line producer), after which Jennifer Weeks produced the next four seasons of syndicated Millionaire shows, initially accompanied by Amanda Zucker as <b>her</b> <b>line</b> producer, but later joined for the 2008–09 season by Tommy Cody (who became sole producer in the 2009–10 season). The first 65 shuffle format episodes were produced by McPaul Smith, and as of 2011, the title of producer is held by Bryan Lasseter. The network version had Ann Miller and Tiffany Trigg for its supervising producers; they were joined by Wendy Roth in the first two seasons, and by Michael Binkow in the third and final season. After Rubino's promotion to co-executive producer, the syndicated version's later supervising producers included Sirop (2004–09), Geena Gintzig (2009–10), Brent Burnette (2010–12), Geoff Rosen (2012–14), and Liz Harris (2014–16), who currently serves as the co-executive producer.|$|E
5|$|Mechner's main preoccupation {{for this}} new storyline was keeping the {{narrative}} simple and engaging, using his preferred writing style of keeping cutscenes short and working {{as much of the}} story as possible into the gameplay. He also aimed to mix narrative and gameplay genres that might normally clash with one-another. The three main characters he created were the hero (the Prince), the villain (the Vizier) and the love interest and sidekick (Farah). Two non-playable authority figures (the Prince's father Shahraman and the Sultan of Azad) were included to add weight to the Prince's burden as they were transformed into monsters by the Sands. The three artefacts each character used (the Dagger, Farah's medallion and the Vizier's staff) were created to explain their survival of the Sands' release, with the Dagger also becoming integral to gameplay. The Prince's narration was both difficult and satisfying for Mechner. It needed to be written to work on two levels: first to be understandable for first-time players, and to gain greater significance upon future playthroughs. The narration also served to give gentle hints to the player, and expand upon the setting and add depth to the experience. Among his cited reference points for the narration were the 1940s version of The Thief of Bagdad, the works of Edgar Allan Poe, and films such as Double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard. The Prince's interactions with Farah were also an important factor. As part of the character interaction, Farah was deliberately designed not to be a perfect archer, sometimes hitting the Prince if he strayed into <b>her</b> <b>line</b> of fire. Despite this, unspecified features planned for her needed to be cut.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} week in China, Kuzmich had problems delivering <b>her</b> <b>lines</b> for the CoverGirl Queen Collection commercial. Mr. Jay noted {{that while she}} looked gorgeous, Kuzmich could not say <b>her</b> <b>lines</b> well - even when he fed them line by line. Despite taking a great CoverGirl shot, {{she found herself in}} the bottom two because of her inability to deliver, even while being given help from Mr. Jay.|$|R

25|$|In 2000 a full book of Mendelssohn's poetry was {{published}} by Salt Publishing under its 'Folio' imprint and Equipage, this time not using her pseudonym.

25|$|The first filmed {{pilot was}} {{produced}} in April 1991, with Frances Fisher playing Jill Taylor. Fisher, primarily known as a dramatic actress, was well qualified for the co-starring role but was viewed by the studio audience as not being comedic enough, and too serious in <b>her</b> <b>line</b> delivery. The producers tried to work with Fisher on adapting to the situation comedy setting, but shortly after the pilot wrapped post-production, they decided to recast her.|$|E

25|$|The Hollyoaks {{wardrobe}} department aim {{to dress}} their characters to reflect their financial earnings. Grace earns {{a considerable amount}} of money in <b>her</b> <b>line</b> of work. Therefore, {{she is one of the}} shows most expensive characters to supply clothing for. When Wall is required to appear on-screen undressed she has to have a scar applied to her stomach.

25|$|Later in <b>her</b> <b>line</b> of work, In-ha discovers Choi Dal-po's real {{identity}} is Ki Ha-myung and is disgusted by {{what her mother}} Cha-ok did to his family during the fire accident.

Non-celebrities include the lifelong Los Angeles-area resident who challenged the panel with <b>her</b> <b>line,</b> afterward reminiscing how 43 years earlier she had traveled to New York, where Arlene Francis identified her as a meter maid. A clip from the kinescope was played.|$|E
25|$|Amy Gray (Amy Brenneman), an {{attorney}} and Harvard graduate, moves back to her hometown of Hartford, Connecticut after separating from her husband Michael in New York City. She and her six-year-old daughter Lauren (Karle Warren) move in with her widowed mother, Maxine Gray (Tyne Daly), who is a caseworker for the Connecticut Department of Children and Families.
