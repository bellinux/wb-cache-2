40|$|Pressure {{platforms}} {{offer the}} potential to measure and record electronic footprints rapidly; however, the accuracy of geometric indexes derived from these prints has not been investigated. A comparison of conventional ink footprints with simultaneously acquired <b>electronic</b> <b>prints</b> revealed significant differences in several geometric indexes.

Four alternatives are presented with each alternative costed out with its associated benefits. The methodology goes a step further than just a cost benefit analysis through its comparison of risks associated with each alternative, sensitivity to number of impressions and productivity gains on the selected alternative and finally the return on investment for the selected alternative. The report can be used in conjunction with the two earlier reports, NASA-TM- 106242 and TM- 106510 in guiding others in determining the cost effective duplicating alternative...|$|E

40|$|Image {{processing}} in {{the field}} of <b>electronic</b> <b>printing</b> is inherently shape-based. Objects such as text, graphics, and photo vignettes often require modification of edge location, stroke width, and corner shape, due to a need to compensate for marking process characteristics or for observer preference. This presentation will begin by describing applications of binary operations, such as conditional erosions and dilations, used to enable printing of fine black or white lines, serifs, and corners. Appearance tuning and appearance matching algorithms will be discussed. The image class will include specialized pixel types, such as high addressable pixels, half bits, and anti-aliased pixels. Loose-fitting gray-scale morphological operators for adjusting anti-aliased line art will be presented. A considerable portion of the presentation will describe "trapping," {{which is one of the}} most commonly applied morphological operations in digital image processing, although it is not typically described as morphological. Trapping is a form of conditional dilation and erosion, where the conditioning is across multiple dimensions (color planes) and gray level...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} was {{to assist in the}} production of electronic images in the Electronic Photography Lab (EPL). The EPL is a new facility serving the electronic photographic needs of the Langley community. The purpose of the Electronic Photography lab is to provide Langley with access to digital imaging technology. Although the EPL has been in operation for less than one year, almost 1, 000 images have been produced. The decision to establish the lab was made after careful determination of the centers needs for electronic photography. The LaRC community requires electronic photography for the production of <b>electronic</b> <b>printing,</b> Web sites, desktop publications, and its increased enhancement capabilities. In addition to general use, other considerations went into the planning of the EPL. For example, electronic photography is much less of a burden on the environment compared to conventional photography. Also, the possibilities of an on-line database and retrieval system could make locating past work more efficient. Finally, information in an electronic image is quantified, making measurements and calculations easier for the researcher...|$|E

40|$|The {{thermal model}} of {{electronic}} device (sizes 0. 36 x 0. 24 x 0. 16 m, mass 4 kg), functioning in {{the conditions of}} space vacuum, is offered. The temperature re-gime of device case is maintained by the passive thermal control system on heat pipe of variable thermal resistance with heat removal by the radiation into the opened space. The analysis of components of thermal balance for the electronic device case is conducted, and an approach to the thermal modeling of the system “electronic cards – device case – heat pipe – environment” is developed {{by means of the}} SolidWorks Flow Simulation program. The parameters of required structural elements (multilayer thermal insulation, supports), at which the passive regulation of the device temperature in the range of 293 ± 10 K at the change of heat generation from 1. 5 W to 15 W, the temperature of environment surrounding a device within 253 [...] . 323 K, and absorbed heat flux from external sources of 120 … 270 W/m 2 is realized, are determined.
