40|$|This paper {{introduces}} Neighbor Aware Adaptive Power ooding, an optimized ooding mechanism used {{in mobile}} ad hoc networks (MANETS) that employs several mechanisms (neighbor coverage, power control, neighbor awareness and local optimization) {{to limit the}} broadcast storm problem, reduce <b>duplicate</b> <b>packet</b> reception and lower power consumption in both transmission and reception. Upon receiving an optimized broadcast, a relay determines {{a new set of}} possible relays (to continue the ood) based upon local neighbor information and the previous optimized broadcast. Additionally, neighboring relays only consider the shared neighbors they are closest to. A relay may perform local optimization (to reduce power consumption and isolate broadcasts) by substituting one high power broadcast with two or more low power broadcasts, thereby introducing additional hops. We show that compared to blind ooding and multipoint relaying, NAAP in a static environment greatly reduces the problems associated with the broadcast storm problem, <b>duplicate</b> <b>packet</b> reception and power consumption...|$|R
50|$|Digipeaters {{keep track}} of the packets they forward for a period of time, thus {{preventing}} <b>duplicate</b> <b>packets</b> from being retransmitted. This keeps packets from circulating in endless loops inside the ad-hoc network. Eventually, most packets are heard by an APRS Internet Gateway, called an IGate, and the packets are routed on to the Internet APRS backbone (where <b>duplicate</b> <b>packets</b> heard by other IGates are discarded) for display or analysis by other users connected to an APRS-IS server, or on a Web site designed for the purpose.|$|E

50|$|Conceptually, each {{portion of}} the {{transmission}} (packets in most data link layers, but bytes in TCP) is assigned a unique consecutive sequence number, and the receiver uses the numbers to place received packets in the correct order, discarding <b>duplicate</b> <b>packets</b> and identifying missing ones. The problem with this {{is that there is}} no limit on the size of the sequence number that can be required.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} in details the IPTV system, together with its implementation methods and the involved protocols. Furthermore, measurement methods of QoS parameters are analyzed, discussing a practical application {{for evaluation of}} IPTV traffic parameters. The following components are taken into account: bandwidth, one-way delay, inter-packet jitter, packet loss, number of <b>duplicated</b> <b>packets,</b> out-of-order packets and corrupted packets. In addition, two QoS parameters of importance for VoD are measured: START delay and PAUSE/RESUME delays. The implementation of this program opens the possibility of measuring the transmission parameters that influence QoS, {{with the purpose of}} offering a way to evaluate and control the services delivered by open-standards IPTV providers...|$|R
40|$|International audienceContention-based Geographic Forwarding (CGF) {{has emerged}} {{recently}} as an energy-efficient communication proto- col {{to improve the}} wireless sensor networks lifetime. By exploiting the wireless broadcast advantage and node spatial diversity, it mitigates the effect of varying channel condition and node unavailability. The main contributions are based on classical relay selection scheme such as most forward within radius. However, this relay selection scheme performs poorly under real radio environments because it tends to forward packets on unreliable link, which leads to high expected number of retransmissions in each hop and an important number of <b>duplicated</b> <b>packets.</b> In this paper, we investigate the performance of several relay selection schemes. First, extensive simulations are proposed to evaluate their performance locally in terms of packet delivery ratio and <b>duplicated</b> <b>packets.</b> Then, we extend the work in multi- hop wireless networks and evaluate their performance in term of energy. To highlight their gain, we propose a smart solution obtained by linear programming. Based on the intelligent relay selection scheme, we develop a new solution, Furthest Forward within Reliable neighbors (FFRe), which tries to save more energy than the most efficient relay selection schemes...|$|R
50|$|Even worse, the {{increased}} number of packets being sent around the internetwork was likely to cause congestion, which was likely to cause a packet to be delayed past the timeout yet again, which would then cause yet another <b>duplicate</b> <b>packet</b> to be generated by a timeout, {{and from then on}} a third copy of each packet would be sent. Needless to say, at that point, the situation would usually snowball, and further copies would be generated â€” hence the name given to this pattern of behaviour.|$|R
50|$|LoRaWAN {{defines the}} {{communication}} protocol and system architecture {{for the network}} while the LoRa physical layer enables the long-range communication link. LoRaWAN is also responsible managing the communication frequencies, data rate, and power for all devices. Devices in the network are asynchronous and transmit when they have data available to send. Data transmitted by an end-node device is received by multiple gateways, which forward the data packets to a centralized network server. The network server filters <b>duplicate</b> <b>packets,</b> performs security checks, and manages the network. Data is then forwarded to application servers.|$|E
30|$|<b>Duplicate</b> <b>packets</b> {{will lead}} to the waste of energy consumption. But this problem is {{inevitable}} while reducing delay as much as possible. Because multiple forwarding nodes may be awake at the same time, <b>duplicate</b> <b>packets</b> will be generated whether forwarding nodes transmit the same packet to their next nodes or return the ACK to the sender. In the approach proposed in this paper, the selection of nodes is optimized, and for each sender, only its forwarding nodes within a small range will be synchronized, in order to avoid aggravating the problem of <b>duplicate</b> <b>packets</b> compared to other approaches.|$|E
40|$|In this work, we {{proposed}} a new approach for designing a multicasting protocol with reduced number of <b>duplicate</b> <b>packets.</b> The main feature of this protocol is that it reduces the number of <b>duplicate</b> <b>packets</b> which are generated while decreasing the number of extra (control) packets for multicasting. This ensures that our protocol uses better bandwidth utilization which is a requirement for multicasting...|$|E
40|$|Mobile ad hoc {{network is}} an {{autonomous}} system of mobile nodes characterized by wireless links. The major challenge in ad hoc networks lies in adapting multicast communication to several environments, where mobility is unlimited and failures are frequent. Reliable multicast delivery requires a multicast message to {{be received by}} all mobile nodes in the communication group. The recovery mechanism requires feedback messages from {{each one of the}} receivers. In the tree-based recovery protocols, a group of nodes into recovery regions designate a forwarding node per region for retransmitting lost messages. In this study, local error recovery algorithm is applied within these relatively smaller regions, where the repaired packets are retransmitted only to the requested receivers in the local group. These receivers create a sub group from the local group which itself is a subgroup of the global multicast group. By applying local error recovery algorithm, the number of <b>duplicated</b> <b>packets,</b> due to packets retransmission, decreases which lead to improving the system performance. Simulation results demonstrate the scalability of the proposed algorithm in comparison to Source Tree Reliable Multicast (STRM) protocol. The algorithm achieved up to 2. 33 % improvement on the percentage of <b>duplicated</b> <b>packets</b> in stable mobility speed without incurring any further communication or intense computation overhead...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{existing}} routing protocol designed for WSNs assume that links are symmetric which is in contradiction {{to the reality of}} these networks. Indeed, asymmetric links cannot be ignored in WSNs as they can be predominant. The apparition of asymmetric links can dramatically decrease routing protocols that are not designed to support them by decreasing the delivery ratio and increasing the <b>duplicated</b> <b>packet</b> received at the destination. Obviously, most of {{the existing}} routing protocols prune the asymmetric links and only maintain the symmetric ones. From our point of view, the asymmetric links have to be considered as they can be effective in the network connectivity insurance. Moreover, they open new opportunities to improve the performance of routing protocols. From this perspective and in order to take benefit from asymmetric links, we propose a routing protocol for data collection in WSNs called AsymRP (Asymmetric Routing Protocol). AsymRP is a convergecast routing protocol which is based on a 2 -hop neighbor knowledge combined with implicit and explicit source routing acknowledgment. Our proposal takes advantage of asymmetric links, enables the network to achieve higher delivery ratio while reducing significantly the number of <b>duplicated</b> <b>packets</b> and hop counts. Our simulation results show that our proposal AsymRP can significantly outperform traditional routing protocols in the presence of asymmetric links in the network...|$|R
30|$|Other packet handler modules work in {{a similar}} fashion to each other. Each module first {{performs}} a <b>duplicate</b> <b>packet</b> checking, then updates LocT by using the position information of the source, the destination, and the previous node. If the packetâ€™s final destination is the node itself, then the packet is passed to the upper layer for further processing. If the packet is destined to an other node or a geographical location, it is enqueued to be forwarded by the packet sender module with a new next hop. A generic flow for tha packet handler modules is given in Algorithm 3.|$|R
40|$|Many {{internet}} applications need live {{multimedia data}} to be transmitted over the network. To incorporate the same, applications like video conferencing and e-learning need IP multicast or unicast. However in internet applications, lack of multicast services play a deterrent role in group communication. When live multimedia data is transferred to more than one receiver over the network, the more number of <b>duplicate</b> <b>packets</b> are transferred. Due to this <b>duplicate</b> <b>packets,</b> bandwidth and other resources are not properly utilized. When network connection is slow then clustering duplicate packetstakes place in link. Due to this clustering, there is a chance for the data loss to occur. A CacheCast mechanism can be used on the router to eliminate such type of <b>duplicate</b> <b>packets.</b> Cache is placed on the router which acts independently for the sender and receiver. In single source multiple destinations,while transferring live multimedia data to more number of receivers, the <b>duplicate</b> <b>packets</b> may occur on the link. All <b>duplicate</b> <b>packets</b> are removed at the nearest router of sender and retrieved from the nearest router of receiver. This technique is used to achieve the better utilization of bandwidth. When send the live data to more than one receiver, bandwidth is efficiently used and the receiverâ€™s side originaldata has to be reconstructed without any discrepancies...|$|E

In our approach, senders and receivers use ephemeral state probes to determine where to inject functionality. A special function that <b>duplicates</b> <b>packets</b> matching a particular pattern and forwards them to a specific destination is then instantiated at the desired network location...|$|R

As the synchronization of physical clocks with an acceptable ac-curacy is often infeasible in large networks, Lamport [5] introduced logical timestamps for message based systems.

We present an implementation which integrates a logi-cal timestamp into IP packets without increasing the packet size.

In this case, in each carousel cycle, some repair symbols are sent alongside the original symbols. Although this approach improves the performance of the carousel, <b>duplicate</b> <b>packets</b> still occur at the receiver if the user needs more than one cycle to acquire the file(s). Therefore, in order to prevent <b>duplicate</b> <b>packets</b> at the receiver, we combine data carousels with Raptor fountain codes.|$|E
40|$|Efficient and {{scalable}} {{information dissemination}} {{is important in}} network management, packet routing and auto configuration. Given {{the very nature of}} a mobile ad hoc network, this information dissemination provides a challenging problem. This paper introduces a new packet flooding mechanism for information dissemination in mobile ad hoc networks. Neighbor Aware Adapative Power (NAAP) flooding, attempts to reduce redundant broadcasts and power consumption during flooding with the aim of minimizing medium contention among neighboring nodes thereby allowing for increased channel utilization. We show that compared to blind flooding and a multipoint relay mechanism, NAAP in a non-mobile environment with increasing node density shows increased performance in the reduction of power consumption and received <b>duplicate</b> <b>packets.</b> At 300 nodes: NAAP consumes 84 % less power than blind flooding and 29 % less power than multipoint relaying; nodes using NAAP receive 89 % less <b>duplicate</b> <b>packets</b> than blind flooding and 43 % less <b>duplicate</b> <b>packets</b> than multipoint relaying...|$|E

Given the broadcast nature of ad hoc network communications, information dissemination provides a challenging problem. In this paper we compare the performance of existing distributed ad hoc network flooding algorithms indentifying stengths and weaknesses inherent in each mechanism. Additionally we propose to apply the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm in a distributed manner as the basis of an optimised ad hoc network flooding algorithm called Localised Minimum Spanning Tree Flooding (LMSTFlood). LMSTFlood provides significant reduction in <b>duplicate</b> <b>packet</b> reception, average transmission distance and energy consumed. Thus LMSTFlood limits the broadcast storm problem more effectively than existing optimised flooding mechanisms. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} TCP performance in an ad hoc network, support from the lower layers of the transport layer is required. Although retransmission by the data link layer is generally required for errors on a wireless channel in ad hoc networks, <b>duplicate</b> <b>packets</b> due to the disappearance of a receipt check can be generated {{at the same time}} and increase network vain load. In the high load networks, packets tend to collide, and <b>duplicate</b> <b>packets</b> are often generated. Once loads begin to become high, the loads will increase further and further.

However, there was no <b>duplicate</b> <b>packet</b> checking or alias substitution.

5000|$|An {{attacker}} who can eavesdrop {{and predict}} {{the size of}} the next packet to be sent can cause the receiver to accept a malicious payload without disrupting the existing connection. The attacker injects a malicious packet with the sequence number and a payload size of the next expected packet.

Unlike in connection hijacking, the connection is never desynchronized and communication continues as normal after the malicious payload is accepted. TCP veto gives the attacker less control over the communication, but makes the attack particularly resistant to detection. The large increase in network traffic from the ACK storm is avoided. The only evidence to the receiver that something is amiss is a single <b>duplicate</b> <b>packet,</b> a normal occurrence in an IP network.
