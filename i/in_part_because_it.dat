5|$|During the {{planning}} of Troll, which opened in 1990, {{it was decided that}} the station was to be placed at such a location as to allow it to have an airstrip for year-round operations. Jutulsessen was chosen as the location, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> provided a base nunatak for the research station {{and at the same time}} was close to blue ice for the runway. At the time, all cargo and passengers to Troll had to either be transported by ship, or flown in via the airport at the Russian base Novolazarevskaya or Henriksenskjera.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill passed}} the House and Senate quickly and was made law on March 19, 1816. But, the measure proved {{extremely}} unpopular with voters, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{applied to the}} current Congress. Many legislators who supported the bill lost their congressional seats as a result, including Johnson's colleague Solomon P. Sharp from Kentucky. Johnson's popularity in other matters helped him retain his seat. Two days into the next session, he recanted {{his support for the}} law. It was repealed in that session, and in its place, legislators passed an increase in the per diem salary.|$|E
5|$|The birth {{certificates}} and wills of Roman citizens {{had to be}} written in Latin until the time of Alexander Severus (reigned 222–235). Illiterate Roman subjects would have someone such as a government scribe (scriba) read or write their official documents for them. Laws and edicts were posted in writing as well as read out. Public art and religious ceremonies were ways to communicate imperial ideology regardless of language spoken or ability to read. An early form of story ballet (pantomimus) was brought to Rome by Greek performers and became popular throughout the multilingual Empire <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> relied on gesture rather than verbal expression.|$|E

5|$|Tristano {{first met}} saxophonist Charlie Parker in 1947. They played {{together}} in bands that included bebop musicians Dizzy Gillespie and Max Roach {{later that year}} for radio broadcasts. The pianist reported that Parker enjoyed his playing, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was different from what Parker was accustomed to and did not copy the saxophonist's style. In 1948 Tristano played less often in clubs, and added Konitz and a drummer to his regular band, making it into a quintet. This band recorded the first sides for the New Jazz label, which later became Prestige Records. Later that year Warne Marsh, another saxophonist student of Tristano's, {{was added to the}} group.|$|E
5|$|Interviews with random {{pilots in}} Widerøe {{showed that the}} airline had {{shortcomings}} in its training procedures, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> lacked a Dash 7 simulator. There was a culture in the airline to divert from cockpit procedures and cooperation. The flight plans often made procedures for mutual control of procedures impractical, and they were commonly skipped. The commission was of the impression that Widerøe's transition from an all-Twin Otter airline to also operate the more demanding Dash 7 was not properly carried out, which had resulted shortcomings in the training and operating procedures. All checklists during the flight were followed correctly. However, the pilots did not elect a method of double-control of the descent and approach, such as by using briefings and callouts.|$|E
5|$|Njai Dasima was {{directed}} by Bachtiar Effendi for Tan's Film, a production company owned by the Tan brothers. With this {{he became the first}} native Indonesian film director in the Indies. It starred Momo and Oesman. The story was adapted from G. Francis' 1896 novel Tjerita Njai Dasima, which Tan's had already adapted in 1929 with the same name for their first release. The story was already well known in Batavia (now Jakarta), <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was a popular part of stage performers' repertoires. To ensure the quality of the story, Effendi worked with a scenario and, later, shooting script– two items which had, until then, never been used for a domestic production.|$|E

5|$|Lastly, Asch {{suggested}} that group influence can change how people perceive stimuli (See Asch, 1940 for an example). This {{is the most}} obscure of Asch's major ideas, <b>in</b> large <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> has not been cited frequently (Levine, 1999), but is none-the-less important <b>because</b> <b>it</b> speaks {{to the power of}} group influence.|$|R
5|$|The Kaluza–Klein {{theory and}} {{subsequent}} attempts by Einstein to develop unified field theory were never completely successful. In part {{this was because}} Kaluza–Klein theory predicted a particle {{that has never been}} shown to exist, and <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was unable to correctly predict the ratio of an electron's mass to its charge. In addition, these theories were being developed just as other physicists were beginning to discover quantum mechanics, which would ultimately prove successful in describing known forces such as electromagnetism, as well as new nuclear forces that were being discovered throughout the middle part of the century. Thus it would take almost fifty years for the idea of new dimensions to be taken seriously again.|$|E

25|$|The vast painting—it {{measures}} 10 by 22 feet (3.1 by 6.6 meters)—drew both {{praise and}} fierce denunciations from critics and the public, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> upset convention by depicting a prosaic ritual {{on a scale}} which would previously have been reserved for a religious or royal subject.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the high}} regard of Jones' peer journalists and the Linux {{community}} (or possibly <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> of <b>it),</b> {{a number of}} prominent attacks against Groklaw and Jones occurred.

50|$|Membrane {{proteins}} {{are inherently}} hard to design, <b>in</b> large <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{is hard to}} validate the designs experimentally for several reasons. Membrane proteins are hard to purify. Their structure is hard to characterize because they adopt their native conformation only {{in the presence of}} a membrane. Crystallization is inherently hard, and NMR studies of membrane proteins can fail because of their size.|$|R
25|$|In September 2005, Vicky Hamilton of the University of Hawaii at Manoa {{presented}} {{an analysis of}} the origin of ALH84001 using data from the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey spacecraft orbiting Mars. According to the analysis, Eos Chasma in the Valles Marineris canyon appears to be the source of the meteorite. The analysis was not conclusive, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was limited to areas of Mars not obscured by dust.|$|E
25|$|The {{scale of}} {{destruction}} in these waves {{was such that}} the Ghent historian Marcus Van Vaenewijk (1516–69) recorded that {{in the summer of}} 1566 the burning pyres on which the works were thrown could be seen from 10 miles away. Because of this, art historian Susie Nash points out that the Ghent work seems so unusual <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{was one of the few}} major examples to survive wholly intact.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} {{publication}} of the poem was by Robert Hartley Cromek, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> occasioned an initial friendship between Cromek and William Blake to turn to acrimony, and in turn because it led to Blake's Public Address, in which he criticized the work of engravers relative to that of illustrators for being as derivative as (amongst others) the translation {{of the works of}} Homer by Alexander Pope into rhyming couplets.|$|E

25|$|In June, the Korean War {{broke out}} between {{communist}} North Korea (DPRK) supported by China and the Soviet Union, and South Korea (ROK) {{supported by the}} United States and its allies in the UN. The Cold War was turning 'hot' in East Asia, and the American government feared communist domination of the entire region would have deep implications for American interests. The US became strongly opposed {{to the government of}} Ho Chi Minh, <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was supported and supplied by China.|$|E
25|$|Per M. Backe became CEO of OSAS, and was {{replaced}} by Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen. ESAS had two opposing goals: to operate the partner's aircraft along the 3–2–2 ratio, and operate them most rationally. Because of the un-unified fleet composition, these were often not possible to combine. DNL lost NOK17 million in 1948, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> had the least efficient aircraft and received no compensation for its higher operating costs. To remain liquid, DNL received NOK35 in capital from the state through loans.|$|E
25|$|However, SGI {{had many}} {{customers}} {{for whom the}} change from IrisGL to OpenGL would demand significant investment. Moreover, IrisGL had API functions that were irrelevant to 3D graphics. For example, it included a windowing, keyboard and mouse API, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was developed before the X Window System and Sun's NeWS. And, IrisGL libraries were unsuitable for opening due to licensing and patent issues. These factors required SGI to continue to support the advanced and proprietary Iris Inventor and Iris Performer programming APIs while market support for OpenGL matured.|$|E

25|$|In humans, {{there is}} no {{evidence}} for riboflavin toxicity produced by excessive intakes, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> has lower water solubility than other B vitamins, because absorption becomes less efficient as doses increase, and because what excess is absorbed is excreted via the kidneys into urine. Even when 400mg of riboflavin per day was given orally to subjects in one study for three months to investigate the efficacy of riboflavin in the prevention of migraine headache, no short-term side effects were reported. Although toxic doses can be administered by injection, any excess at nutritionally relevant doses is excreted in the urine, imparting a bright yellow color when in large quantities.|$|E
25|$|Continuing {{weight loss}} may {{deteriorate}} into wasting, a vaguely defined condition called cachexia. Cachexia differs from starvation <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> involves a systemic inflammatory response. It {{is associated with}} poorer outcomes. In the advanced stages of progressive disease, metabolism can change so that they lose weight {{even when they are}} getting what is normally regarded as adequate nutrition and the body cannot compensate. This leads to a condition called anorexia cachexia syndrome (ACS) and additional nutrition or supplementation is unlikely to help. Symptoms of weight loss from ACS include severe weight loss from muscle rather than body fat, loss of appetite and feeling full after eating small amounts, nausea, anemia, weakness and fatigue.|$|E

The lake and its surrounding wetland areas are among the richest Nordic areas for waders, ducks, geese and swans. Fjærvann remains the most important such area along the river, <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{is one of the first}} parts of the watershed to be ice-free.
