5000|$|Military {{units in}} Rise and Fall are grouped as infantry, cavalry, special, siege, or naval. Infantry, cavalry, and some special units {{automatically}} group themselves into formations - groups of soldiers that receive attack and defense bonuses - when {{at least eight}} {{of that kind of}} unit is present; the maximum number of units a formation may consist of is sixty-four. The unit's speed, attack, defensive capabilities, and range vary, depending on several factors; these include their civilization; unit type; the upgrades that have been purchased; {{whether or not they are}} in formation, and, if so, its size. Three resources - wood, gold, and glory - are used to build structures, train units, purchase upgrades; a <b>fourth</b> <b>resource,</b> stamina, is spent using [...] "hero mode." [...] Wood and gold are deposited in settlements, or one of their various upgrades, such as town centers. Glory and stamina are both earned: glory by building and fighting, and stamina when the hero unit kills an enemy. In several RTS games, upgrades - sometimes called [...] "Ages" [...] - are available that represent time periods or technological levels; Rise and Fall uses a similar concept. When upgrades to the hero - called [...] "Levels" [...] in this game - are purchased with glory, new technologies, upgrades, units, and advisors are unlocked. Advisors - paid for with glory as well - provide civilization-specific benefits and bonuses to the player's army and economy. Outposts, guarded by artificial intelligence soldiers, - soldiers who defend automatically - also play an important part in Rise and Fall. Conquering outposts increases the number of units trained from military buildings or ships, while not augmenting their price. The outpost guardians, however, protect it, and reappear until the outpost is taken by a player; once captured, they protect the outpost from attacks by the owner's enemies.|$|E

The distance between genetics service sites is great and the population density in the regions being served is low. The local resources available to the genetics services sites participating in data collection vary from robust to "bare-bones". The approach to solving the problem involved the following.

40|$|Objectives: The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the co-marketing interface and the contingencies between co-marketing and business performance from the viewpoint of the business partners of IBM. More specifically, the objective was to introduce what co-marketing is, what elements can be found in the co-marketing interface, and what kind of contingencies there are between the elements of the co-marketing partnership and business performance. Methodology: A literature review of co-marketing and business performance was used to create a theoretical framework for the study. The empirical data was collected by semi-structured qualitative interviews with IBM's business partners, and the research methodology of the multi-case study was used. Key findings: According to the findings, four elements of the co-marketing interface were perceived to influence business performance positively: structural linkages, information sharing, orientations of the partners, and resources pooling. First, systematic joint planning of co-marketing (as one dimension of the structural linkages), which involves different units inside the allied organizations was perceived to lead to better business performance. Moreover, the importance of the target group planning and the planning of the measurement methods of the co-marketing success were emphasized in the interviews. Second, in order to improve business performance, the co-marketing partners need to share information related to, for instance, market insights, marketing ideas, and best practices. Third, the orientations, especially, the market orientation and long-term orientation in the co-marketing planning, were perceived to lead to better business performance. <b>Fourth,</b> <b>resources</b> pooling, especially the utilization of the other partners' capabilities and knowledge, was perceived to be a way to success in co-marketing in strategic alliances...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} collective action issues in common property resources. Its focus is the “threshold hypothesis,” which posits {{the existence of}} a threshold in group size that drives the process of institutional change. This hypothesis is tested using a six-century dataset concerning the management of the commons by hundreds of communities in the Italian Alps. The analysis seeks to determine the group size threshold and the institutional changes that occur when groups cross this threshold. There are five main findings. First, the number of individuals in villages remained stable for six centuries, despite the population in the region tripling in the same period. Second, the longitudinal analysis of face-to-face assemblies and community size led to the empirical identification of a threshold size that triggered the transition from informal to more formal regimes to manage common property resources. Third, when groups increased in size, gradual organizational changes took place: large groups split into independent subgroups or structured interactions into multiple layers while maintaining a single formal organization. <b>Fourth,</b> <b>resource</b> heterogeneity seemed to have had no significant impact on various institutional characteristics. Fifth, social heterogeneity showed statistically significant impacts, especially on institutional complexity, consensus, and the relative importance of governance rules versus resource management rules. Overall, the empirical evidence from this research supports the “threshold hypothesis. ” These findings shed light on the rationale of institutional change in common property regimes, and clarify the mechanisms of collective action in traditional societies. Further research may generalize these conclusions to other domains of collective action and to present-day applications...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to learn about the {{experiences}} of teachers as they transition from traditional grading practices to standards-based reporting (SBR). In order to achieve this overall objective, the following research questions framed this qualitative study: 1) What understandings related to practices do middle school teachers have as they transition from traditional grading practices to standards-based reporting? 2) What kinds of supports do teachers need as they transition from traditional grading practices to standards-based reporting? 3) Is there a change in teachers 2 ̆ 7 clarity regarding what their students know, understand, and do as they transition from traditional grading practices to standards-based reporting? Twelve teachers from a Midwestern suburban middle school were interviewed individually and in focus groups to provide insight into the research questions. Interviews were conducted face-to-face and analyzed. Six themes emerged from the data. First, in a SBR grading scheme, a grade truly represents what a student knows, understands, and is able to do. Second, SBR helps teachers achieve clarity in what their individual students know, understand, and are able to do. Third, active engagement, trust, and support from administration is valued and needed by educators transitioning to SBR. <b>Fourth,</b> <b>resources</b> such as time, professional literature, collaborating with peers, aligning rubrics with the curriculum, observing others implementing SBR, and adopting a reporting tool that is SBR-friendly are essential components of support. Fifth, formative assessment, flexible grouping, and differentiation are instructional practices that naturally lead to SBR. Sixth, opportunities for parent education and effective communication with stakeholders are imperative for a successful SBR transition. The teachers in this study appeared to be happier and more satisfied with their work in moving students forward in their learning when implementing SBR, evidenced by students learning at higher levels as well as teacher clarity in students 2 ̆ 7 instructional needs. The success of the implementation of SBR was due, in part, to a slow, multi-year process of transforming practices that naturally led to SBR such as formative assessment, flexible grouping, feedback, and differentiation. Equally important to changes in instruction was a collaborative culture committed to engaging all students in learning at high levels. Recommendations for future research are to study schools at the secondary level that have fully implemented SBR, schools that have adopted a dual system of letter grades and SBR, and college level students who have graduated from a secondary SBR system...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationships}} among organizational culture, gender and sexual harassment. To investigate these relationships, I conducted a qualitative study using as data both in-depth interviews with 20 employees in manufacturing organizations and textual analyses of three sexual harassment policies. The results indicate a relationship between how people construct both gender and sexual harassment. This relationship reveals itself in five interrelated conclusions. First, the organizational cultures were firmly grounded in masculinity and at times, hegemonic masculinity. Masculinity was reified within the hierarchical structure and the communication patterns of the organizations. So powerful was the construct of masculinity, that little expression of femininity was voiced by employees or management. Second, sexual harassment {{is part of the}} normal functioning and structure of the organization; this is built on the gendered assumption that male heterosexual behavior is considered normal in manufacturing organizations. For example, objects like sexually explicit calendars or sexual jokes were reconstructed into normal expressions of masculinity and as such, deemed appropriate for the workplace, not sexual harassment. Third, gendered communication patterns were also related to sexual harassment. This was illustrated by a preference for assertive, unemotional communication, and by re-defining factory women as masculine and sexual joking as normative. <b>Fourth,</b> Human <b>Resource</b> (HR) departments are often marked as feminine and as a result HR is not highly valued. This has serious consequences as most sexual harassment complaints are handled through HR departments. Finally, there is a notion that the real cause of sexual harassment in manufacturing is not because people harass, but because women are present. Implications and applications for the findings are discussed, and possible avenues for future research are offered...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2010. The aim of {{this study}} was to conduct a {{thorough}} theoretical study on the relevant aspects involved in knowledge management and organizational learning, and thence assess the level of organisational learning within the ferrometallurgical industry. From the outcomes of the assessment, recommendations to improve the state of affairs were to be made. Knowledge can be defined as actionable information. The creation, acquisition, sharing and leveraging of knowledge in today's industries are critical. Knowledge is now termed the <b>fourth</b> productive <b>resource,</b> and some authors claim, with some justification, that the widespread knowledge within a company is the only source of sustainable competitive advantage. With this in mind, it is obvious that companies need to nurture knowledge creation and effective utilisation thereof in order to meet organisational goals. Knowledge can be codified if it is explicit, but needs to be transferred using personalisation if it is tacit. Implicitness of tacit knowledge further confounds the issue. Knowledge management practices underpin the process of organisational learning. The level of organisational learning within the ferrometallurgical industry in South Africa was assessed, using a survey questionnaire obtained from the Harvard Business School. The results show that the industry lags behind the medians in the ten constructs measured, and much work will be required to significantly improve the situation. Key areas of concern are in the areas of psychological safety, time for reflection, education and training, and collection of information. As a consequence, a practical strategy for improving the state of knowledge management and organisational learning in the ferrometallurgical industry was developed. Master...|$|R
30|$|With energy {{consumption}} continuing {{to rise and}} fossil fuels inevitably trending toward limitation, humanity is urged to find alternative energy resources. One most recent emerging focus of energy generation has been the use of biofuels which can be generated from sustainable biomass feedstocks (Tilman et al. 2009). On {{the top of the}} list of renewable biomass resources that are suitable for biofuel production is crop straw, which is ranked as the <b>fourth</b> largest energy <b>resources</b> after coal, oil and natural gas. The major structural component of crop straw is lignocellulose, a heterogeneous complex mainly consisting of two carbohydrate polymers (cellulose, hemicellulose), and an aromatic polymer (lignin) (Bayer et al. 2004). Currently, the bioconversion strategy is regarded as the most common approach for industrial utilization of lignocellulosic biomass, which explores natural microbial colonizers of lignocellulose or their lignocellulose-degrading enzymes to decompose the recalcitrant structural polymers to easily metabolizable monosaccharides which are subsequently converted to products (Balan 2014). Improving the bioconversion efficiency of lignocellulosic biomass has received increased attention from researchers in recent years.|$|R

First, many rich community representatives try to satisfy a political majority who would then abstain from using the punishment mechanism, and exclude those community members whose approval is then not required. The frequency of this exclusion strategy is highest with private information on the distribution and public voting.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is proposed}} for optimizing {{the allocation of}} resources in the detection of computer fraud. The methodology consists of four major segments. First, a threat assessment is performed. A general threat assessment is provided which relies upon reported incidents of computer fraud. Then, recognizing the limitations of computer fraud reporting, a specific threat assessment technique is provided which is based entirely {{on the characteristics of}} a given computer system. Both the general and specific threat assessment techniques use a matrix approach which evaluates and assigns threat values by type of computer fraud and perpetrator. Second, a Detection Quotient is established which measures the effectiveness of computer fraud detection resource allocation for all of the possible combinations of computer fraud types and perpetrators. However, for many computer systems, the large number of possible resource allocation alternatives results in a Combinatorial Dilemma whereby the phenomenally large number of alternatives precludes comprehensive analysis. This leads to the third major segment of the dissertation, a General Solution to the Combinatorial Dilemma which ensures an alternative very near the optimum while evaluating only an extremely small percentage of possible alternatives. <b>Fourth,</b> a <b>Resource</b> Optimization Model is provided which, beginning with the results of the Threat Assessment, iteratively assigns varying levels of computer fraud detection resources to different fraud type and perpetrator combinations. Using the general solution to the Combinatorial Dilemma and the Detection Quotient as a measure of the effectiveness of each combination, the model produces a statistically defensible near optimum allocation of available resources to computer fraud detection.

40|$|Most natural {{resources}} {{that are used in}} production are non-renewable. When they become depleted they are lost for future use. Does it follow that the limited availability of {{natural resources}} will at some time in the future constrain economic growth as many environmentalists believe? While classical economists have shared the belief in limits to growth, the distinctive feature of modern neoclassical economics is its optimism about the availability of natural resources. This survey suggests that resource optimism can be summarised in four propositions. First, a rise in the price of a resource leads to a substitution of this resource with another more abundant resource and to a substitution of products that are intensive in this resource. Second, a rise in the price of a resource leads to increased recycling of the resource and to the exploration and extraction of lower quality ores. Third, man-made capital can substitute for natural <b>resources.</b> <b>Fourth,</b> technical progress increases the efficiency of resource use and makes extraction of lower quality ores economical. In a critical analysis of these four propositions it is shown that while the conjecture that natural resources will never constrain future economic growth is logically conceivable, we do not and indeed cannot know whether it will be possible in practice to overcome any resource constraint...|$|R

Yet there are few studies of part-time i-deals specifically, or empirical studies of their development process. This article examines the process of achieving a part-time i-deal, drawing on interviews with 39 part-time professionals in two organizations, each located in the UK and the Netherlands. The article makes two contributions to i-deal theory: first, it defines the four elements of a new category of ‘reduced time and workload’ i-deal for professionals (perceived suitability of the work, schedule, workload, and career impact); and second, it refines Rousseau’s model of the development process, by adding an initial ‘private consideration’ of options stage, where the feasibility of working part-time is evaluated against alternatives including remaining full-time, or leaving the organization. Third, it identifies as structural constraints two work practices designed for full-time professional work in demanding environments: the routine expectation of unpredictability, {{and the absence of}} substitutability in <b>resourcing.</b> <b>Fourth,</b> it shows how, post-negotiation, professionals use informal job crafting, both individual and collaborative, to try to overcome these constraints.

The provisional ES use pattern vary as per {{the proximity of the}} ecosystems and availability of the alternative options. Moreover, the study also showed a strong upstream-downstream linkages in terms of trade-off among the communities living at different ecosystems. The study suggests following actions to address the changing effect of LULCC. First of all, looking into the tourism driven local economy, and people’s high dependency on ES, demand and supply chain gap from need special attention with socio-ecological system approach. Second, restoration of the degraded areas through the inspection and regular monitoring of survival rate of planted seedlings. Third, alternative energy (improved cooking stoves, biogas) installation would add significant results to reduce further pressure on the <b>resources.</b> <b>Fourth,</b> an investment on establishing natural water ponds might be some viable options to collect rain water runoff to cope up with water scarcity to some extent. Lastly, an effort of establishing Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) may further address the issue of siltation that is affecting hydropower plant and electricity generation. In order to draw detailed conclusions for decision-making and management of ecosystems in the study site, a socio-ecological linkage would give a better picture. A socio-ecological system approach would enable a clear policy reformulation that would support to keep ecosystems a healthy.|$|R
40|$|Emergency {{responders}} {{are faced}} with a number of significant challenges when managing major disasters. First, the number of rescue tasks posed is usually larger than the number of responders (or agents) and the resources available to them. Second, each task is likely to require a different level of effort in order to be completed by its deadline. Third, new tasks may continually appear or disappear from the environment, thus requiring the responders to quickly recompute their allocation of <b>resources.</b> <b>Fourth,</b> forming teams or coalitions of multiple agents from different agencies is vital since no single agency will have all the resources needed to save victims, unblock roads and extinguish the fires which might erupt in the disaster space. Given this, coalitions have to be efficiently selected and scheduled to work across the disaster space so as to maximize the number of lives and the portion of the infrastructure saved. In particular, {{it is important that the}} selection of such coalitions should be performed in a decentralized fashion in order to avoid a single point of failure in the system. Moreover, it is critical that responders communicate only locally given they are likely to have limited battery power or minimal access to long-range communication devices. Against this background, we provide a novel decentralized solution to the coalition formation process that pervades disaster management. More specifically, we model the emergency management scenario defined in the RoboCup Rescu...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{many small}} {{companies}} or businesses are highly concentrated on profit and less consider about managing their businesses professionally, including PT JCC. Nowadays, profit-oriented {{is not a}} solely factor to be succeed in competing both locally and internationally. Instead, those companies {{need to be more}} considering on the key elements of management. The writers use both primary and secondary analysis. As a result, the writers find that PT JCC has no specific vision and mission, organized organizational structure, proper leadership style, and high-qualified human resources inside the company. In addition, this company is still less in motivating the employees. Consequently, such deficiencies can be obstacles for PT JCC to achieve future growth. Therefore, in order to be professional in managing the business to attain future growth, there are some points to be considered. First, PT JCC should have specific vision and mission. Second, re-organize the organizational structure. Third, re-arrange the leadership style to be more properly. <b>Fourth,</b> establish Human <b>Resource</b> Division. Finally, it needs to create highly motivated employees. The writers suggest that PT JCC should create specific vision and mission as the first priority. Then, it should establish the Human Resource Division, which has significant role in assisting the company to re-organize the organization structure, and re-arrange the leadership style. The last but not least, such division has role to create highly motivated employees through balancing the intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, facilitating open communication, and creating convenience working environment...|$|R
