5|$|Due {{to rough}} surf from the {{precursor}} low, local National Weather Service offices issued a High Surf Advisory {{for much of}} the coastline from Florida through North Carolina. Upon first becoming a subtropical cyclone, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Altamaha River in Georgia southward to Flagler Beach, Florida. The watch was discontinued after Andrea weakened to a subtropical depression. Additionally, a gale warning was issued {{for much of the}} South Carolina coastline.|$|E

5|$|Multnomah County {{is named}} for Native Americans {{who lived in the}} area before {{settlement}} by non-indigenous people in the 19thcentury. Members of the Multnomah tribe of the Chinookan people lived on Sauvie Island in the Willamette River and on the mainland across from the island, downstream <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> Balch Creek. Much of the area near the lower creek was swampy, and was not favored by the Multnomah. By the 1830s, diseases carried by white explorers and traders reduced the native population by up to 90percent in the lower Columbia basin.|$|E

5|$|Premastication, pre-chewing, or kiss feeding is the act {{of chewing}} food {{for the purpose of}} {{physically}} breaking it down in order to feed another that is incapable of masticating the food by themselves. This is often done by the mother or relatives of a baby to produce baby food capable of being consumed by the child during the weaning process. The chewed food {{in the form of a}} bolus is transferred <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> one individual to another, either directly mouth-to-mouth, via utensils, hands, or is further cooked or processed prior to feeding.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Western Canal was {{conceived}} {{as one of}} several competing schemes to alleviate the hazards and delays of coastal sailing ships making a passage around Land's End to get between the Bristol Channel and the English Channel. A canal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the River Exe to Exeter had been opened in 1566; and eight miles of the River Tone had been made navigable in 1638. Navigation of the River Tone had been extended to Taunton in 1717, by the construction of locks on the upper section.|$|E

Sixhours later, the warning was extended westward to Morgan City, Louisiana. The threat of Beryl prompted some voluntary evacuations in St. Bernard Parish in Louisiana, and also forced the evacuations of thousands from offshore oil rigs. Officials advised small craft to remain at port from Port O'Connor, Texas to Pensacola, Florida.|$|E

Darius spent the winter of 516–515 BCE in Gandhara, preparing to conquer the Indus Valley. Darius conquered the lands surrounding the Indus River in 515 BCE. Darius I controlled the Indus Valley from Gandhara to modern Karachi and appointed the Greek Scylax of Caryanda to explore the Indian Ocean <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Indus to Suez. Darius then marched through the Bolan Pass and returned through Arachosia and Drangiana back to Persia.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{pelicans}} {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica. They primarily inhabit warm regions, although breeding ranges extend to latitudes of 45° South (Australian pelicans in Tasmania) and 60° North (American white pelicans in western Canada). Birds of inland and coastal waters, they are absent from polar regions, the deep ocean, oceanic islands (except the Galapagos), and inland South America, {{as well as}} from the eastern coast of South America <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Amazon River southwards. Subfossil bones have been recovered from as far south as New Zealand's South Island, although their scarcity and isolated occurrence suggests that these remains may have merely been vagrants from Australia (much as is the case today).|$|E
5|$|The 'Beating of the bounds' is {{an ancient}} annual custom first carried out in 1612, which revives the {{traditional}} checking of the sea boundaries awarded to Poole by the Cinque Port of Winchelsea in 1364. The Admiral of the Port of Poole (the mayor) and other dignitaries, {{and members of the}} public sail <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the River Frome to Old Harry Rocks to confirm the Mayor's authority over the water boundaries of the harbour and check for any encroachments. As there are no physical landmarks that can be beaten at sea, traditionally children from Poole were encouraged to remember the bounds of their town by taking part in the 'Pins and Points' ceremony involving the beating of a boy and pricking of a girl's hand with a needle. In modern times, the acts have been symbolically carried out.|$|E

The British Band was reduced to roughly 500 people by this time, including about 150 warriors.

Many made it to one of the two nearby islands, but were dislodged after the steamboat Warrior returned at noon, carrying regulars and Menominees allied with the Americans.|$|E

5|$|The first {{border between}} Wales and England was zonal, apart {{from around the}} River Wye, {{which was the first}} {{accepted}} boundary.

The Act of Union of 1536 formed a linear border stretching <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Dee to the mouth of the Wye. Even after the Act of Union, many of the borders remained vague and moveable until the Welsh Sunday Closing act of 1881, which forced local businesses to decide which country they fell within to accept either the Welsh or English law.|$|E

At 1500UTC on June24, the tropical storm warning was extended to the mouth of the Suwannee River. Simultaneously, a tropical storm watch was issued from the Suwannee River to Anclote Key. These were all canceled at 1500UTC on June25, though a tropical storm warning was then implemented from Destin to Englewood, Florida. Early on June26, a tropical storm warning was issued from Mexico Beach to Englewood, Florida. By 2100UTC that day, the tropical storm warning was extended to the mouth of Steinhatchee River in Florida. This was discontinued after Debby became a tropical depression.|$|E
