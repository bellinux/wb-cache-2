40|$|Warehouse {{management}} system can {{take full advantage}} of the resources and provide efficient warehousing services. The paper aims to show advantages and disadvantages <b>of</b> the <b>warehouse</b> {{management system}} in a chosen enterprise, which is focused on logistics services and transportation. The paper can bring new innovative approach for warehousing and presents how logistics enterprise can reduce logistics costs. This approach includes cost reduction of the establishment, operation and savings in the overall assessment of the implementation <b>of</b> the <b>warehouse</b> management system. The innovative warehouse management system will be demonstrated as the case study, which is classified as a qualitative scientific method, in the chosen logistics enterprise. The paper is based on the research of the world literature, analyses of the internal logistics processes, data and finally enterprise documents. The paper discovers costs related to personnel costs, handling equipment costs and costs for material <b>identification.</b> Implementation <b>of</b> the <b>warehouse</b> management system will reduce overall logistics costs <b>of</b> <b>warehousing</b> and extend the warehouse management system {{to other parts of the}} logistics chain...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the {{creation}} of efficient regional logistic infrastructure that has currently a special relevance. The additional task of this problem is a warehouse network formation. The efficient location <b>of</b> <b>warehouses</b> is one <b>of</b> the priority objectives for cross-border regions as it allows them to benefit from membership in a global supply chain, promotes the creation of additional jobs and, finally, leads to the growth of Gross Regional Product (GRP). The authors offer an approach to determine the location of distribution centres and warehouses in the territory of the regions of the Russian Federation. This approach allows solving the problem of the efficient location <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> network in a region taking into account its key indicators of socioeconomic development. The implementation of the approach identified the indicators that {{have a significant impact on}} a choice of the location <b>of</b> <b>warehouses</b> <b>of</b> a region. Methodological framework of the conducted research includes the methods of ABC and cluster analyses. That provides the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the cities and municipal districts of a region, in the territory of which it is expedient to locate warehouses. The developed approach was tested on the example of the Volgograd region. The solution of the problem <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> network in this region belongs to the priority one, considering its geographical position and industrial capacity. The analysis of indicator values for the period of 2010 – 2014 by means of the methods of classical and modern ABC analysis as well as the two-stage cluster analysis allowed the territorial binding <b>of</b> the <b>warehouse</b> network in the Volgograd region. Further, the research showed that when splitting the cities and municipal districts of the region into clusters, the greatest influence is made by such indicators as investments into fixed capital, goods turnover of the motor transport and transportation of goods by the motor transport...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} the economic viability <b>of</b> the electronic <b>warehouse</b> receipt registry introduction, as a step toward electronic warehouse receipts. Both forms <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> receipt paper and electronic exist in practice, but paper warehouse receipts are more widespread. In this paper, the dematerialization process is analyzed in two steps. The first step is the dematerialization <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> receipt registry, with warehouse receipts still in paper form. The second step is the introduction <b>of</b> electronic <b>warehouse</b> receipts themselves. Dematerialization <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> receipts is more complex than that for financial securities, because of the individual characteristics <b>of</b> each <b>warehouse</b> receipt. As a consequence, electronic warehouse receipts are in place for only to a handful of commodities, namely cotton and a few grains. Nevertheless, the movement towards the electronic warehouse receipt, which began several decades ago with financial securities, is now taking hold in the agricultural sector. In this paper is analyzed Serbian electronic registry, since the Serbia is first country in EU with electronic warehouse receipts registry donated by FAO. Performed analysis shows the considerable impact <b>of</b> electronic <b>warehouse</b> receipts registry establishment on enhancing the security of the system <b>of</b> public <b>warehouses,</b> and on advancing the trade with warehouse receipt...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{focuses on}} the design and {{optimization}} <b>of</b> production <b>warehouses</b> using lean manufacturing tools. Using the internal logistics of a world leader of pasta production as a reference, we propose an approach to lean warehousing employing the well-known Unified Modelling Language (UML) and Value Stream Mapping (VSM) tools, together with the so-called Shikumi methodology. The procedure is iterative and hierarchical. Starting from a detailed description <b>of</b> the <b>warehouse</b> logistics by UML, the VSM graphical approach allows the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> non-value adding activities, and the Shikumi technique leads to a ranking of such system anomalies. The further application of the VSM tool produces an overall picture <b>of</b> the desired <b>warehouse,</b> and the UML framework allows to describe in detail the updated system activities. Application of the approach to the case study shows its effectiveness and leads to an innovative proposal for the warehouse automation and optimization...|$|R

40|$|Warehouse {{management}} system (WMS) {{has been introduced}} and widely used to increase the competitiveness that provides better control on the warehouse operations since the last decade. However, most of the WMS do not support planning and monitoring the use <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> resources but only focus on managing the warehouse operations. The management <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> resources planning with incoming customer orders are solely relied on the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> experts. Decision making process becomes difficult to handle with complex orders. In this paper, a concept <b>of</b> <b>warehouse</b> resources management (WRM) is introduced to the typical WMS by extracting qualified order attributes from WMS for completing the operations with suitable resources. Through the use of rule-based reasoning (RBR) technique, the research objective is achieved to effectively fulfill the customer orders with appropriate resources, thereby achieving better customer satisfaction and increase the warehouse operation efficiency.
