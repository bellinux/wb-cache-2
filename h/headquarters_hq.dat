5|$|On 9 February, two {{divisions}} of the Japanese Twenty Fifth Army, led by Lieutenant General Tomoyuki Yamashita, landed on the northwestern coast of Singapore, in the Sarimbun area. Yamashita's <b>headquarters</b> (<b>HQ)</b> was in the Sultan of Johor's palace on Istana Bukit Serene, which offered him and his officers a bird's eye view of virtually every key target in the northern sector of Singapore Island, only 1.6 kilometres (one mile) across the Straits of Johor. Sultan Ibrahim's palace was not fired upon by the British because any damage caused would have extensive repercussions for British-Johor ties.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1943 the Axis forces had complete control of the airspace over Yugoslavian territory. No aerial opposition of any kind was expected {{and that was the}} primary reason that the bomber force could operate without any fighter cover, notwithstanding {{the fact that there was}} a total lack of any serious fighter force in the ZNDH's squadrons. However, the situation started to change by {{the beginning}} of 1943. The <b>Headquarters</b> (<b>HQ)</b> of the ZNDH had plans to re-arm at least one Group with more modern aircraft of German or Italian origin. The Italians refused to supply the requested Macchi C.200 and Macchi C.202 fighters, as the Regia Aeronautica needed every aircraft to fill its own squadrons in {{the beginning of}} 1943.|$|E

While there, he overhears a {{conversation}} between Chi-Ling Cheung (a secret agent of the People's Republic of China) and Byrdoy Tolstov (a professor in applied physics and chemistry). Tolstov reveals {{that they are not}} mining for uranium, but that they are experimenting with a special compound called tri-nepheline. Tolstov's daughter Alexandria is being held hostage at Security <b>Headquarters</b> (<b>HQ),</b> and Cord rescues her with the help of Chi, who is suspected of being a spy. Afterwards, Cord plants a bug on a secure server and removes a hard drive containing information relating to the VFF. Cord {{goes to the}} Containment Facility to apprehend Nagarov.|$|E
5|$|Post-Independence, being {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} Major General, Cariappa was appointed as deputy chief of the general staff. In November 1947, on {{being promoted}} to the rank of lieutenant general, he was appointed as the Eastern Army commander. In January 1948, owing to the worsening situation in Kashmir, Cariappa was called back to the capital and appointed as the GOC-in-C Delhi and East Punjab Command. After taking over the command, he immediately renamed it the Western Command and moved its <b>headquarters</b> (<b>HQ)</b> to Jammu; he subsequently raised a corps HQ under Lt Gen S.M. Shrinagesh at Udhampur. He appointed Lt Gen Kodandera Subayya Thimayya as the GOC Jammu and Kashmir Force (later 19th Division), and Atma Singh as the GOC Jammu Division (later 25th Division).|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose of}} the project remains {{uncertain}} {{because of the lack}} of documentation.

25|$|In February {{the brigade}} {{transferred}} to the Durham and North Riding County Division in North East England, where it took up an operational role in beach defence. The 8th Battalion's <b>headquarters</b> (<b>HQ)</b> was at Saltburn-by-the-Sea and it took over the defences from Redcar Pier to Staithes. These included concrete pillboxes equipped with Vickers guns, for which the previous training of the battalion's original cadre was useful. The battalion moved to Shildon in County Durham in June and carried out exercises with 215 Bde along the River Tweed against Scottish Command before returning to Saltburn.|$|E
25|$|On August 15, 2009, {{five days}} before the election, a suicide car bomb struck NATO's {{headquarters}} {{at the core of}} Kabul's most fortified district, in the equivalent of Baghdad's Green Zone. The massive blast that shook the city left seven people dead and 91 wounded, including several foreign soldiers, four Afghan soldiers, and a member of parliament. The attack, inside several rings of security around the fortified embassies and government buildings by the presidential palace, was confirmed by a Taliban spokesperson to have had as targets the NATO military <b>headquarters</b> (<b>HQ</b> ISAF) and the U.S. embassy less than 150 meters away, and to have been part of a campaign to disrupt the elections.|$|E
25|$|The {{flanking}} manoeuvre by the Maletti Group misfired, {{because it}} lacked adequate maps and navigation equipment for desert travel {{and the group}} got lost as it moved to its jumping-off point at Sidi Omar. XXIII Corps <b>Headquarters</b> (<b>HQ)</b> had to send aircraft to guide the group into position. The accompanying 1st Libyan Division Sibelle and 2nd Libyan Division Pescatori were also delayed in reaching the rendezvous near Fort Capuzzo and the fiasco led Graziani to cancel the wide flanking manoeuvre. The 10th Army, in a mass of five divisions and the armoured groups, was ordered to move down the coast road, occupy Sollum and advance to Sidi Barrani through Buq Buq. Once at Sidi Barrani, the army would consolidate, extend the Via Balbia by building the Via della Vittoria to move supplies forward, destroy British counter-attacks and then advance to Mersa Matruh. The immobility of the non-motorized infantry divisions forced Graziani to use the coast road, despite the mechanised forces in the army, to try to defeat the British with mass rather than manoeuvre.|$|E

25|$|British {{forces in}} Borneo {{included}} <b>Headquarters</b> (<b>HQ)</b> 3 Commando Brigade in Kuching {{with responsibility for}} {{the western part of}} Sarawak, 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions, and HQ 99 Gurkha Infantry Brigade in Brunei responsible for the East, 4th and 5th Divisions, Brunei and Sabah. These HQs had deployed from Singapore in late 1962 in response to the Brunei Revolt. The ground forces were initially limited to just five UK and Gurkha infantry battalions normally based in Malaya, Singapore and Hong Kong, and an armoured car squadron. The police also deployed a number of light infantry of Police Field Force companies. However, as additional resources became available the size of the force available to Walker expanded, {{and by the end of}} 1964 British forces had grown to approximately 14,000 troops organised into three brigades (increased to four in 1965). The naval effort, under DOBOPS command, was primarily provided by minesweepers used to patrol coastal waters and larger inland waterways around Wallace Bay. A guardship – a frigate or destroyer – was stationed off Tawau.|$|E
