40|$|Abstract Background Studies {{have shown}} {{associations}} of diabetes and <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormones</b> with {{exposure to a}} wide variety of organochlorines. We have previously reported positive associations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and inverse associations of selected steroid hormones with diabetes in postmenopausal women previously employed in a capacitor manufacturing plant. Methods This paper examines associations of PCBs with diabetes and <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormones</b> in 63 men previously employed at the same plant who in 1996 underwent surveys of their exposure and medical history and collection of bloods and urine for measurements of PCBs, lipids, liver function, hematologic markers and <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormones.</b> Results PCB exposure was positively associated with diabetes and age and inversely associated with thyroid stimulating hormone and triiodothyronine-uptake. History of diabetes was significantly related to total PCBs and all PCB functional groupings, but not to quarters worked and job score, after control for potential confounders. None of the exposures were related to insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in non-diabetic men. Conclusions Associations of PCBs with specific <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormones</b> differ in some respects from previous findings in postmenopausal women employed at the capacitor plant. Results from this study, however, do confirm previous reports relating PCB exposure to diabetes and suggest that these associations are not mediated by measured <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormones.</b> </p...|$|R

50|$|In greenhouse-grown peppers, {{studies showed}} {{not only an}} {{increase}} in production (1 kg per m2) but also a significant control of plant <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormone</b> expression. At the start of cultivation {{there was an increase}} in auxin (indoleacetic acid) expression for greater production of roots and mycorrhizal colonisation, higher expression of gibberellins and cytokines resulting in more leaf development and production after 50 days of growth and a significant reduction of abscisic acid favouring more youthful plants {{toward the end of the}} cycle.|$|E
50|$|The patient's serum {{is mixed}} with the labeled thyroid hormone; next, the resin {{is added to the}} whole mixture to measure the amount of free labeled thyroid hormone. So, for instance, if the patient is truly hypothyroid, and TBG levels are normal, then there are many sites open for binding on the TBG, since the total thyroid hormone level is low. Therefore, when the labeled hormone is added, it will bind mostly to the TBG, leaving little of it left for binding to the resin. In contrast, however, if the patient is truly hyperthyroid, and TBG levels are normal, the patient's <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormone</b> will {{saturate}} the TBG binding sites more, leaving less room for the labeled hormone, which allows greater binding to the resin.|$|E

Therefore, one can expect that dysfunction of catecholaminergic systems may lead to significant changes in activities of particular cytochrome P- 450 isoenzymes by altering levels of <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormones.</b> The mechanism underlying dopamine-induced regulation of the liver cytochrome P- 450 expression seems not to be direct, but rather mediated by pituitary hormones and cytokines...|$|R
40|$|The {{changes in}} content of <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormones</b> in stolons and tubers of Jerusalem {{artichoke}} (Helianthus tuberosus L.) regulate tuber growth, but the specific {{knowledge about the}} importance of balance among the <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormones</b> is lacking. Two varieties of Jerusalem artichoke (NY- 1 and QY- 2) were tested for the endogenous zeatin (ZT), auxins (IAA), gibberellins (GA(3)) and abscisic acid (ABA) in regulating sugar and dry matter accumulation in tubers. The dry matter content and sugar accumulation in tubers were correlated positively with endogenous ZT and negatively with GA 3 content and GA(3) /ABA and IAA/ABA content ratios. Throughout the tuber formation, ZT content was higher in NY- 1 than QY- 2 tubers, whereas ABA content was higher in QY- 2 than NY- 1 tubers. The content ratios GA 3 /ABA and IAA/ABA were greater in NY- 1 than QY- 2 before tuber initiation, but QY- 2 surpassed NY- 1 during the tuber growth stage. The GA 3 /ABA and IAA/ABA content ratios declined during tuber growth.

50|$|Ibutamoren (INN) (developmental code names MK-677, MK-0677, L-163,191) is a non-peptidic, potent, long-acting, orally-active, and {{selective}} agonist of the ghrelin receptor and a growth hormone secretagogue, mimicking the growth hormone (GH)-stimulating {{action of the}} <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormone</b> ghrelin. It has been demonstrated to increase the release of, and produces sustained increases in plasma levels of several hormones including GH and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1), but without affecting cortisol levels. MK677 has shown to sustain activation of GH-IGF-1 Axis and increase in lean body mass but no change in total fat mass or visceral fat. It is currently under development as a potential treatment for reduced levels of these hormones, such as in children or elderly adults with growth hormone deficiency, and human studies have shown it to increase both muscle mass and bone mineral density, making it a promising therapy for the treatment of frailty in the elderly.|$|E
5000|$|In 1991, a {{specific}} high affinity sodium pump inhibitor indistinguishable from ouabain was first {{discovered in the}} human circulation [...] and proposed {{as one of the}} potential mediators of long term blood pressure and the enhanced salt excretion following salt and volume loading.

A number of analytical techniques led to the conclusion that this circulating molecule was ouabain and that humans were producing it as an <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormone.</b> A large portion of the scientific community agreed that this inhibitor was endogenous ouabain and that there was strong evidence to indicate that it was synthesized in the adrenal gland. One early speculative interpretation of the analytical data led to the proposal that endogenous ouabain may have been the 11 epimer, i.e., an isomer of plant ouabain. However, this possibility was excluded by various methods including the synthesis of the 11 epimer and the demonstration that it has different chromatographic behavior from ouabain. Critically, the primary observations concerning the identification of ouabain in mammals were repeated and confirmed using a variety of tissue sources on three different continents with advanced analytical methods as summarized elsewhere ...|$|E

40|$|For {{the last}} 40 y, {{substantial}} evidence has surfaced on the hormone-like effects of environmental chemicals such as pesticides and industrial chemicals in wildlife and humans. The endocrine and reproductive {{effects of these}} chemicals {{are believed to be}} due to their ability to: (1) mimic the effect of <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormones,</b> (2) antagonize the effect of <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormones,</b> (3) disrupt the synthesis and metabolism of <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormones,</b> and (4) disrupt the synthesis and metabolism of hormone receptors. The discovery of hormone-like activity of these chemicals occurred long after they were released into the environment. Aviation crop dusters handling DDT were found to have reduced sperm counts, and workers at a plant producing the insecticide kepone were reported to have lost their libido, became impotent and had low sperm counts. Subsequently, experiments conducted in lab animals demonstrated unambiguously the estrogenic activity of these pesticides. Manmade compounds used in the manufacture of plastics were accidentally found to be estrogenic because they fouled experiments conducted in laboratories studying natural estrogens. For example, polystyrene tubes released nonylphenol, and polycarbonate ¯asks released bisphenol-A. Alkylphenols are used in the synthesis of detergents (alkylphenol polyethoxylates) and as antioxidants. These detergents are not estrogenic; however, upon degradation during sewage treatment they may releas...|$|R

We now show that both exocrine proteins behave similarly and enter the regulated secretory pathway as judged by immunolocalization and secretagogue- dependent stimulation of secretion. Analysis of stimulated secretion of newly synthesized proline-rich protein, amylase, and <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormones</b> indicates that the exogenous proteins enter the granule pool with about the same efficiency as the <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormones.</b> However, in contrast to the <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormones,</b> proline-rich protein and amylase are progressively removed from the granule pool during the process of granule maturation such that only small portions remain in mature granules where they colocalize with the stored hormones. The exogenous proteins that are not stored are recovered from the incubation medium and are presumed to have undergone constitutive-like secretion. These results point to a level of sorting for regulated secretion after entry of proteins into forming granules and indicate that retention is essential for efficient storage. Consequently, the critical role of putative sorting receptors for regulated secretion may be in retention rather than in granule entry...|$|R

40|$|Background: Duckweed {{is a novel}} aquatic {{bioenergy}} crop that {{is found}} ubiquitously throughout the world. Uniconazole {{plays an important role}} in improving crop production through the regulation of <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormone</b> levels. We found that a high quantity and quality of duckweed growth can be achieved by uniconazole application, although the mechanisms are unknown. Results: The fronds of Landoltia punctata were sprayed evenly with 800 mg/L uniconazole. The dry weight following treatment increased by 10 % compared to the controls at 240 h. Endogenous cytokinin (CK) and abscisic acid (ABA) content both increased compared to the control, while the level of gibberellins (GAs) decreased. Additionally, gene expression profiling results showed that the expression of transcripts encoding key enzymes involved in endogenous CK and ABA biosynthesis were up-regulated, while the transcripts of key enzymes for GAs biosynthesis were down-regulated. On the other hand, chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b contents were both increased compared with the control. Moreover, the net photosynthetic rate was elevated to 25. 6 mu mol CO 2 /m(2) /s compared with the control value of 22. 05 mu mol CO 2 /m(2) /s. Importantly, the expression of some chlorophyll biosynthesis-related transcripts was up-regulated. Conclusion: Uniconazole treatment altered <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormone</b> levels and enhanced chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate in duckweed by regulating key enzymes involved in <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormone</b> and chlorophyll biosynthesis.

The analysis has been performed on lymphocytes obtained at three different phases of menstrual cycle, from women with regular cycle and hormones dosage. At all phases we further analysed {{the effect of a}} post-treatment with caffeine, an agent that it is known to overrride the DNA damage checkpoints. After MMC, the cultures obtained at ovulation and luteal phases have SCE frequencies statistically higher than the cultures obtained at the progestogenic phase, showing increases of 15 and 25 %, respectively. After caffeine, the MMC treated cultures which were set up at the progestogenic phase show a high potentiation of SCE frequencies (28 %) whereas the treated cultures set up at ovulatory and luteal phases show little or no potentiation. These findings demonstrate that the <b>endogenous</b> <b>hormones</b> greatly modulate the SCE frequencies induced by the mutagen; they also indicate that hormones action competes with the caffeine effect.
