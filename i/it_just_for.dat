Not {{only does it}} bring most of the United States Military Academy's traffic to Thayer Gate, its main entrance, it attracts many who drive <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> the sake of its most renowned portion: the cliffside drive {{alongside}} Storm King Mountain. In good weather {{during the summer months}} many cars can be seen taking in the views of the river and the Hudson Highlands here (however, this section can be gated off and closed in times of high rockslide danger).|$|E
25|$|The {{pilot for}} the show was {{recorded}} in 1967, featuring Clement Freud, Derek Nimmo, Beryl Reid and Wilma Ewart as panellists. The chairman was originally planned to be Jimmy Edwards but he was unavailable on Sundays, the proposed recording dates, {{and was replaced by}} Nicholas Parsons who was originally supposed to be a panel member. Parsons did not want the job and only reluctantly took <b>it,</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> the pilot episode. After the show settled in, again he found himself in the role of a straight man for the panellists. Although executives at the BBC disliked the pilot, its producer, David Hatch, threatened to resign if he could not oversee a full series. Not wishing to lose Hatch, the BBC acquiesced.|$|E

In 2001, the magazine Red Pepper wrote that Lobster [...] ".. succeeds {{on the quality}} of its writing... articles are well researched... human, passionate and honest...", the Fortean Times (who also syndicated a regular Lobster column by Ramsay) wrote that it [...] was [...] "... immensely engrossing reading, ...an essential purchase for anyone interested in the machinations of the secret state", Green Anarchist magazine wrote that Lobster is [...] "... an invaluable resource, and deserves to be widely read and much studied", and Direct Action magazine described it as [...] "a good read ... very revealing and worth <b>it,</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> the pub talk".|$|E

500|$|Howarth said of {{starring}} on a soap opera, [...] "Every actor at {{one time}} passes through daytime. I wouldn't have said yes to the offer if I didn't want to stay a while on daytime." [...] He added, [...] "I don't crave fame. It's kind of goofy. I didn't {{want to be a}} public figure. I wanted to be an actor, not a movie star. But I love rock 'n' roll-there, I'd rather be a rock star. That would be cool." [...] He said that [...] "like all soap actors," [...] he sticks with the script the majority of the time, [...] "but every now and then he goes off the page," [...] commenting, [...] "You get to direct yourself. You come up with a little bit. It's improvisational. Maybe you're doing <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> your castmates, but the audience catches on." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{overview}} of the third season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Apocrypha" [...] was rated an A. The review noted that the episode offered [...] "some interesting progressions in the grand theme" [...] of the series, although it was also [...] "worth <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> the awesome missile site finale" [...] alone. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen also rated the episode an A. Handlen felt the episode was impressive in its general impression, but that the details were not necessarily important; he also added that the cyclical nature of the plot of most mythology episodes was not something he felt negatively about, noting that although the series' protagonists are often defeated, they [...] "can't be corrupted or dissuaded or undone". Co-writer Frank Spotnitz said of the episode [...] "I actually think you didn't learn a lot more about the conspiracy in these two episodes, but emotionally, I think they were really good episodes ... It is really easy to go through a lot of these action things with people dying and never addressing them. So I thought it was very interesting to do so".|$|E
500|$|Title {{was entirely}} written and {{composed}} by Meghan Trainor and Kevin Kadish, and produced by Kadish. The pair recorded the EP at The Carriage House in Nolensville, Tennessee. It was mastered by Dave Kutch at The Mastering Palace in New York City, New York. Besides writing and composing the record, Trainor was {{also responsible for}} its drum programming, percussion instrumentation, clapping and ukulele melodies, as well as handling the EP's executive production with Kadish. Title was developed using {{a wide range of}} other instrumentation; drums, acoustic guitar, electric guitar and bass—all produced by Kadish. David Baron and Jim Hoke were the only two other musicians involved in the EP's production, and were responsible for the record's piano, baritone saxophone, tenor saxophone and hammond organ instrumentation. In an interview with The Baltimore Sun, Kadish spoke of the record's conception, [...] "We were like, 'Let's do a '50s EP and see if anybody likes <b>it,</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> fun.'" [...] Regarding the title of the EP, Trainor told Popjustice, [...] "So I've called the EP Title. Cos obviously everyone was going, 'what's the title', and I was like, 'hey, I'm clever, I'm gonna make it this'." [...] The name was deemed [...] "creative" [...] by Idolator's Mike Wass. Dear Future Husband" [...] was inspired by a joke Trainor made with her father, where she would say that her future husband [...] "is out there somewhere, chilling". Trainor described the EP as having a [...] "doo-wop feel" [...] reminiscent of [...] "All About That Bass," [...] but being different lyrically. Trainor noted that Title takes on themes that [...] "not {{a lot of people think}} about," [...] such as commitment and staying true to one's self. The EP was Epic Records' idea to prove that Trainor was not a one-hit wonder, following the success of her debut single, [...] "All About That Bass". In an interview with James Sullivan of The Boston Globe, the singer said that Title focuses on [...] "an awkward 19-, 20-year-old, when you're pretty sure you're an adult but you're not, yet." [...] She went on to add, [...] "All the songs sound very similar—very personal, girl power anthems." [...] Trainor felt the EP's album tracks showcased her better than what [...] "All About That Bass" [...] did.|$|E

Life {{magazine}} called him the [...] "Lullaby Kid", noting that [...] "couples at country-club dances grew misty-eyed when the band went into [...] "Always", because they were positive that Berlin had written <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> them.

2500|$|The Deranged Mad Zombies, like Zodiac, is a band {{composed}} of the same members of Balzac; it first appeared in 2006. The name came from various influences of singer/songwriter Hirosuke. [...] "Deranged" [...] comes from the title {{of one of his}} favorite movies. [...] "Mad" [...] derives from the name of one of his favorite Japanese bands, the Mad Capsule Markets. [...] "Zombies" [...] is taken from The Misfits song [...] "Astrozombies". More than a side-project, this band is an experiment by the band members who felt like doing <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> fun. All the songs released under this name are in fact Balzac songs, mixed down rougher and trashier, giving each song more of a lo-fi and under-produced sound. For the full-length album the band launched under this moniker, they kept their identities hidden using nicknames and showing no track list or band photo on the package. Only 20 copies of the self-titled CD were pre-ordered before the fans found that this was in fact Balzac in disguise. So far the band has released two more albums and one official bootleg under this name.|$|E
