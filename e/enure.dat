Its statement that for an expense to be charged [...] "there must be some indication that the payment is for services that may ultimately <b>enure</b> to the benefit {{of the members of the}} local union" [...] implies that the benefit to the worker need not be in the form of increased leverage against the employer.|$|E

Impious! I will bless thee, black-vested minister of Optimism, stern pioneer of happiness!

6000|$|Such was the poetical {{inheritance}} {{of style and}} diction into which Spenser was born, and which he did more than any one else to redeem from the leaden gripe of vulgar and pedantic conceit. Sir Philip Sidney, born the year after him, with a keener critical instinct, and a taste earlier emancipated than his own, would have been, had he lived longer, perhaps even more directly influential in educating the taste and refining the vocabulary of, his contemporaries and immediate successors. The better of his pastoral poems in the [...] "Arcadia" [...] are, in my judgment, more simple, natural, and, above all, more pathetic than those of Spenser, who sometimes strains the shepherd's pipe with a blast that would better suit the trumpet. Sidney {{had the good sense}} to feel that it was unsophisticated sentiment rather than rusticity of phrase that befitted such themes.[264] He recognized the distinction between simplicity and vulgarity, which Wordsworth was so long in finding out, and seems to have divined the fact that there is but one kind of English that is always appropriate and never obsolete, namely, the very best.[265] With the single exception of Thomas Campion, his experiments in adapting classical metres to English verse are more successful than those of his contemporaries. Some of his elegiacs are not ungrateful to the ear, and it can hardly be doubted that Coleridge borrowed from his eclogue of Strephon and Klaius the pleasing movement of his own Catullian Hendecasyllabics. Spenser, perhaps out of deference to Sidney, also tried his hand at English hexameters, the introduction of which was claimed by his friend Gabriel Harvey, who thereby assured to himself an immortality of grateful remembrance. But the result was a series of jolts and jars, proving that the language had run off the track. He seems to have been half conscious of it himself, and there is a gleam of mischief in what he writes to Harvey: [...] "I like your late English hexameter so exceedingly well that I also <b>enure</b> my pen sometime in that kind, which I find indeed, as I have often heard you defend in word, neither so hard nor so harsh but that it will easily yield itself to our mother-tongue. For the only or chiefest hardness, which seemeth, is in the accent, which sometime gapeth, and, as it were, yawneth ill-favoredly, coming short of that it should, and sometime exceeding the measure of the number, as in Carpenter; the middle syllable being used short in speech, when it shall be read long in verse, seemeth like a lame gosling that draweth one leg after her; and Heaven being used short as one syllable, when it is in verse stretched out with a diastole, is like a lame dog that holds up one leg."[266] It is almost inconceivable that Spenser's hexameters should have been written by the man who was so soon to teach his native language how to soar and sing, and to give a fuller sail to English verse.|$|E

40|$|Without a doubt, Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) {{technology}} has been encountering an explosive growth lately. IEEE 802. 11 is the standard associated with this promising technology, which <b>enures</b> shared access to the wireless medium through the distributed coordination function (DCF). Recently, the IEEE 802. 11 e task group has made extensions to WLANs medium access control (MAC) {{in order to support}} quality of service (QoS) traffic. An inherited problem for WLANs, is the volatility of the propagation medium, which is a challenging issue that affects the system performance significantly. Consequently, enhancing the operation of the DCF in noisy environments is of great interest, and has attracted the attention of many researchers. Our first major contribution in the presented thesis, is an analytical and simulation analysis for the binary exponential backoff (BEB) scheme of the DCF, in the presence of channel noise. We show that following the BEB procedure when a host encounters erroneous transmission is needed only if the channel was highly loaded. However, incrementing the contention window (CW) upon each packet failure, whether caused by instantaneous transmission (i. e. collision) or channel noise, will result in the waste of air time if the channel was lightly loaded. Accordingly, we present a hybrid access method that adapts the CW according to the channel load along with the frame error rate (FER). Other means to overcome the channel noise is the adjustment of the transmission rate. Many rate adaptation (RA) algorithms were introduced in the past few years, including the Automatic Rate Fallback (ARF) which is currently implemented in the wireless cards. Yet, many drawbacks are associated with these RA algorithms; specifically, in regard to the techniques and events that should trigger the rate change. Moreover, the IEEE 802. 11 e QoS flows requirements were not considered with the latter schemes. Accordingly, our next major contribution in this work is the presentation of a novel rate adaptation scheme. The simplicity of the introduced rate adaptation scheme is that it relies on the MAC layer parameters rather than those of the PHY layer when adjusting the rate. Furthermore, our algorithm supports the IEEE 802. 11 e MAC extensions where QoS traffic requirements were integrated in the procedure of adjusting the bit rate. Hence, strict real-time flow parameters such as delay and maximum drop rate are respected. Finally, we enhance the dynamic assignment of transmission opportunities (TXOPs) in order to offer fair air-time for nodes facing high packet loss rat...|$|R

In this study, we assess the influence of specific functional groups on the adsorption selectivity of CO 2 /N- 2 mixtures through Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. Our model system consists of a bilayer graphene nanoribbon that has been edge functionalized with OH, NH 2, NO 2, CH 3 and COOH. Ab initio Moller-Plesset (MP 2) calculations with functionalized benzenes are used to obtain binding energies and optimized geometries for CO 2 and N- 2. This information is used to validate the choice classical forcefields in GCMC simulations. In addition to simulations of adsorption from binary mixtures of CO 2 and N- 2, the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) is used to predict mixture isotherms. Our study reveals that functionalization always leads to an increase in the adsorption of both CO 2 and N- 2 with the highest for COOH. However, significant enhancement in the selectivity for CO 2 is only seen with COOH functionalized nanoribbons. The COOH functionalization gives a 28 % increase in selectivity compared to H terminated nanoribbons, whereas the improvement in the selectivity for other functional groups are much <b>Enure</b> modest. Our study suggests that specific functionalization with COOH groups can provide a material's design strategy to improve CO 2 selectivity in microporous adsorbents.

40|$|Chemical or {{radioactive}} {{air pollutants}} whether emitted accidently or by routine releases {{into the environment}} from industrial sources may be catastrophic if not monitored, assessed and controlled. Atmospheric dispersion modeling of such pollutants is an essential regulatory requirement for environmental impact assessment (EIA), safety analysis and emergency preparedness and planning (EPP). It may help in decision making regarding the emergency evacuation of population from affected areas in accidental scenario or emission reduction in specific situations when air quality is deteriorating unacceptably. Present research is directed initially on computational modeling methodology for precise atmospheric dispersion of pollutants and subsequently towards practical setups, procedures and experimentation for model validation. The proposed modeling strategy involved use of â€˜coupled meteorological and dispersion modelsâ€™ in Pakistan specific conditions. Thus output of a meteorological model at all nodal points of the grid under consideration can be coupled or used as precise input for dispersion model. Using this concept, advanced dispersion models such as CALPUFF and FLEXPART were coupled with appropriate meteorological models such as MM 5 and WRF for realistic predictions. Sensitivity of different empirical correlations or parameterization schemes of the meteorological model was thoroughly investigated prior to coupling it with dispersion model to <b>enure</b> its valid use for geographical and climatic conditions of Pakistani region. Sensitivity analysis of four parameterized schemes in MM 5 model for Pakistani region indicated that Grell scheme generated better results for all parameters and resolutions for lesser precipitation intensity. A detailed study using coupled meteorolgical and dispersion model wasperformed in this research. Modeling results {{in the form of}} ground level pollutant concentrations were verified by conducting field tracer experiments, a work that has never been carried out for any Pakistani region. In present work, experimentation was performed using two gaseous tracers, sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6). The first set involved small scale dispersion experiments over a flat ground at Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences (PIEAS) by releasing SO 2 gas at a rate of 0. 05 g/sec from a height of 30 ft. In the second set of experimental work, emissions from a brick kiln of 60 ft height with SO 2 release rate of 0. 3 g/s were measured at different sampling points covering larger distances up to 1640 ft. Moreover, the available data of groud level SO 2 concentrations from a cluster of stacks of oil refnery and oilfield was also used for validating the results of dispersion modeling studies. In the third set of experiments, a 100 ft high experimental stack, designed, fabricated and installed as a part of this research was used to release SO 2 at a controlled precise rate of 0. 6 g/s and air sampling was done at varied directions and distances ranging up to about 3000 ft. In the final set of experiments, SF 6 gas was released with a rate of about 7. 0 g/s at a height of 230 ft and samples were taken at 36 sampling points simoultaneously at distances ranging from 2300 ft to about 33000 ft. Overall trends of time series plots of measured and modeled SO 2 concentrations using PIEAS experimental stack were found to be in reasonable agreement as reflected by correlation coefficient â€˜râ€™ and Index of agreement â€˜dâ€™ ranging from 0. 74 to 0. 91 and 0. 40 to 0. 64 respectively. This shows that coupled model performance was satisfactory for prediction of ground level SO 2 concentration. The SF 6 test results demonstrated the cross-wind diffusion as well as down-wind dispersion very well. A slight deviation in directions of plume and sampling point locations was observed. This {{may be due to the}} difference in predicted and real wind directions. However, this indicated a limitation of the modeling strategy in reproducing instantaneous behavior of wind over a short sampling period of 10 minutes. To incorporate the effect of atmospheric chemical reactions on predicted ground level concentrations by FLEXPART dispersion model, few new subroutines were written and suggested to be incorporated into the model. In order to trace out â€˜the real time- three dimensional particle trajectoryâ€™ predicted by coupled MM 5 and FLEXPART model, a three-dimensional post-processor was also developed in this research work to show the multilayered data of regional topography, geography, wind field and particles positions. The â€˜coupled-modelâ€™ results and subsequent visualization of particle trajectories exhibited an irregular shaped â€˜potential vulnerable areaâ€™ covered by the plume. It was quite different from expected straight line plume dispersion generally predicted by Gaussian Plume Model (GPM). This more precise visualization in an accidental scenario may help disaster management authorities in making decisions regarding emergency evacuation of population from indicated â€˜potential vulnerable areasâ€™...|$|E
