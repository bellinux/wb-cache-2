40|$|The plate {{silencer}} [1] {{that consists}} of an expansion chamber with two side-branch cavities covered by a light panel can achieve a desirable noise reduction in broadband theoretically. The concept is similar to drum silencer [Choy YS, Huang L. Experimental studies of drum-like silencer. J Acoust Soc Am 2002; 112 : 2026 - 35]. To attain optimal noise reduction, either the membrane of the silencer should be of minimal weight while retaining very high tensile strength or the panel should be kept at very high bending stiffness that is dependent on its geometry and mechanical properties. To achieve such goal, various kinds of composite system such as carbon fibres or aluminum were mounted on light core foam to build a noise reflection panel. A design of composite panels which can provide a reduction in panel weight as well as enhance the bending stiffness, is introduced in this paper.

However, handling of fresh radical prostatectomy specimens has been notoriously challenging given the distinctive physical properties of prostate tissue and the difficulty to identify cancer foci on gross examination. Here, we have developed a novel approach using ceramic <b>foam</b> <b>plates</b> for processing freshly cut whole mount sections from radical prostatectomy specimens without compromising further diagnostic assessment. Forty-nine radical prostatectomy specimens were processed and sectioned from the apex to the base in whole mount slices. Putative carcinoma foci were morphologically verified by frozen section analysis. The fresh whole mount slices were then laid between two ceramic <b>foam</b> <b>plates</b> and fixed overnight. To test tissue preservation after this procedure, formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded whole mount sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and analyzed by immunohistochemistry, fluorescence, and silver in situ hybridization (FISH and SISH, respectively).

The quality of immunohistochemistry, FISH, and SISH was excellent.

40|$|The planned new {{railway station}} in Holmestrand whose {{location}} will be inside a basalt plateau poses challenges concerning the grouting {{and water and}} frost protection. Based on grouting works in adjacent tunnels Snekkestad and Sj&# 248;skogen {{as well as the}} entrance tunnels of the station hall, a loosely attempt to predict the grouting sitatuation for the station hall will be made. Pre-construction investigations including CPTU, oedometer, piezometers and ERT tomography have hardly revealed any signs of inflows. The precipiation pattern causes seasonal fluctuations in the groundwater. Hydrologically, the Holmestrand plateau is naturally drained by the existing Holmestrand road tunnel. The Holmestrand plateau consists of column basalt and various soil masses cover its top. There exists a weakness zone that may cause problems for the station hall, meaning that grouting will have to be extensive to maintain the inflow criterion. By the aid of a formula of calculating the expected inflow for the station hall, a strict requirement emerges when comparing this to a standard double-lane railway. Grouting works will take place at an inflow criterion of 5 L/(min/(100 m)) by pre-grouting fans. Should difficult geological conditions occur, control fans, extra fans and post-grouting fans may be applied. Measuring water loss and inflow may happen, both by construction of dams in the tunnel and directly measuring the inflow from boreholes. Alternatives to grouting include concrete lining, etc. Likely water and frost protection solutions are PE <b>foam</b> <b>plates,</b> concrete elements, sprayable membranes such as the BASF masterseal 345, etc. The latter has been tested in a frost laboratory and the Geving&# 229;sen tunnel, where the most important conclusions are that the freezing index has no effect of how deep the zero-degree isotherm penetrates into the rock mass and that the temperature pattern is not cumulative. The tunnel results show no significant leakages. Also, the BASF masterseal 345 shows high deformation load capacities. Results from the grouting show highly varying trends according to the difference in geology, both when studying the distribution of grout amounts and the pressure per borehole per grouting fan and the total amounts of grout mass and the average pressure per grouting fan. In areas of the cross-section with low-quality rock the pressure seems to decrease and the amounts of grout mass increase. Also, the inflow criterion does not always control the amounts of injected mass, as the overburden and surface installations, as well as the rock mass and joint system situation play an important role. 3 D measurements giving the rock stress distribution may also serve as guidelines for the grouting works, as will the vertical joint situation of the station hall. The water and frost protection solution is likely to be either the PE <b>foam</b> <b>plates</b> or the concrete elements. The author argues that the BASF masterseal 345 shows decent qualities but requires more testing before being applied at such a project. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe final {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to improve the mechanical behaviour of composite sandwich structures under dynamic loading (impact or crash). Cellular materials are often used as core in sandwich structures and their behaviour has a significant influence on the response of the sandwich under impact. Syntactic foams are widely used in many impact-absorbing applications and can be employed as sandwich core. To optimize their mechanical performance requires the characterisation of the foam behaviour at high strain rates and identification of the underlying mechanisms. Mechanical tests were conducted on syntactic foams under quasi-static and high strain rate compression loading. The material behaviour has been determined as a function of two parameters, density and strain rate. These tests were complemented by experiments on a new device installed on a flywheel. This device was designed in order to achieve compression tests on foam at intermediate strain rates.

Although most lightweight materials, such as aluminum, are {{more expensive than the}} conventional materials concrete and structural steel, savings result due to the comprehensive cost analysis over the lifetime of a building. For example cost advantages can be achieved during the transport to the building site and in the dimensioning of the basement. Semi-finished aluminum foams, especially sandwiches are excellent for lightweight constructions. The applicability has already been proven in several serial applications for machine tools. In the building industry aluminum foam is still an almost unknown material. Due to ist cellular structure aluminum foam is very light. The material has also a high vibration damping capacity. Semi-finished products made from or made with aluminum foam are usually offered in shape of pure <b>foam</b> <b>plates,</b> sandwiches and foam-filled hollow structures. Large structures can excellently be produced by using prefabricated semi-finished aluminum foam. In this lecture the fabrication of the foams, their properties, available composite materials and opportunities for the machinability of the foams and their semi-finished products are shown and principles of lightweight design that can be realized with the new materials will be presented.

The flow plate of a PEM fuel cell {{is one of the most}} important structures in these devices. Effective design of the flow plate will aid in the optimisation of PEM fuel cell technology. Due to the low operational temperature of PEM fuel cells, water species can form in the flow field and this can affect their performance. Two phase flow models were used to study this phenomena. These models show how the water flooding in flow field channels can hinder the mass transport if these are not properly designed, leading to reduced performance, increased heat and reduced fuel utilisation.
