5|$|Sir John Betjeman (1906–1984) was a twentieth-century English poet, {{writer and}} broadcaster. Born to a middle-class family in Edwardian Hampstead, he {{attended}} Oxford University, although left without graduating. He {{turned down a}} position in the family furniture business, and instead took a series of jobs before becoming the assistant editor of The Architectural Review in 1931, which reflected a <b>deeply</b> <b>held</b> affection for buildings and their history. That same year he published his first book, Mount Zion, a collection of poems.|$|E
5|$|An {{official}} {{in charge of}} ethnic and religious affairs in Guangdong said that the province had hired Uygurs, aged from 18 to 29, in May. A small group of Uyghurs arrived on 2 May, and workers at the factory remarked that {{relations between the two}} groups deteriorated as the number of Uyghurs increased. State media confirmed that all the workers were from Shufu County. China Labor Watch reported that workers at the Shaoguan factory, where the Uyghurs were employed, earned 28 yuan per day compared with 41.3 yuan in its factory in Shenzhen. They noted that rights of workers, Han and Uyghur alike, were frequently violated by verbal abuse from factory supervisors, unpaid overtime, poor dormitory conditions and illegal labour contracts. Li Qiang, executive director of China Labor Watch said that low pay, long hours and poor working conditions combined with the inability to communicate with their colleagues exacerbated <b>deeply</b> <b>held</b> mistrust between the Han and Uyghurs.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of the new}} {{limitations}} {{placed on}} future Merina monarchs by Rainilaiarivony and the Hova courtiers, Radama's strangling represented {{more than a simple}} coup d'état. The ruling conditions imposed on Rasoherina reflected a power shift toward the oligarchs of the Hova commoner class and away from the Andriana sovereigns, who had traditionally drawn their legitimacy from the <b>deeply</b> <b>held</b> cultural belief that the royal line was imbued with hasina, a sacred authority bestowed by the ray aman-dreny (ancestors). In this respect, the new political structure in Imerina embodied the erosion of certain traditional social values among the Merina elite, who had gained exposure to contemporary European political thought and assimilated a number of Western governance principles. It also signalled the expansion of a rift between the pro-European, progressive elite to which Rainilaiarivony and his brother belonged, and {{the majority of the population}} in Madagascar, for whom traditional values such as hasina remained integral to determining the legitimacy of a government—a divide that would deepen in the decades to come through Rainilaiarivony's efforts to effect a modernizing political and social transformation on a nationwide scale.|$|E

50|$|With the {{outbreak}} of WWI, few blacks were serving in the Canadian military because of the racial attitudes prevalent at the time. Initially, some blacks attempted to enlist in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, but most were rejected. The Department of Militia and Defence's policy towards recruitment was to defer to the judgement of the individual commanding officer, and since many <b>held</b> <b>deeply</b> ingrained beliefs about the inferiority of blacks, very few were accepted.|$|R
25|$|From the Renaissance onwards, {{elaborate}} {{variations on}} the Green Man theme, often with animal heads rather than human faces, appear in many media other than carvings (including manuscripts, metalwork, bookplates, and stained glass).

A Swiss engraver, Numa Guyot created a bookplate depicting a Green Man in exquisite detail. It was completed circa 1887.|$|E
25|$|Social {{activism}} {{had existed}} in Eugene {{prior to the}} mall's opening, and it had both a loyal following and an infrastructure. When Eugene acquired a large, landscaped, outdoor public-use venue with convenient public transportation, it seemed in fulfillment of <b>deeply</b> <b>held</b> social needs that were not dependent upon retail sales. People angry about the Vietnam War gathered on the mall. The mall was an ongoing location for counter-cultural activity. Retail customers experienced unhappiness at the widening generation gap. When Springfield Creamery owner Chuck Kesey, brother of author Ken Kesey, brought the Grateful Dead to the Oregon Renaissance Faire to play a benefit concert for the creamery in 1972, the Eugene Mall {{seemed like a good}} waiting room for the next concert. That concert did not occur until 1982.|$|E
25|$|Wisconsin {{historian}} William Hesseltine {{added the}} point that the Northeastern businessmen wanted to control the Southern economy directly, which they did through ownership of the railroads. The Beard-Beale interpretation of the monolithic Northern industrialists fell apart in the 1950s when it was closely examined by numerous historians, including Robert P. Sharkey, Irwin Unger, and Stanley Coben. The younger scholars conclusively demonstrated that there was no unified economic policy {{on the part of the}} dominant Republican Party. Some wanted high tariffs and some low. Some wanted Greenbacks and others wanted gold. There was no conspiracy to use Reconstruction to impose any such unified economic policy on the nation. Northern businessmen were widely divergent on monetary or tariff policy, and seldom paid attention to Reconstruction issues. Furthermore, the rhetoric on behalf of the rights of the Freedman was not claptrap but <b>deeply</b> <b>held</b> and very serious political philosophy.|$|E

25|$|Fred Tupper (Neil Crone)– The local loudmouth and {{the host}} of a talk show on the local radio station, he often equates Muslims to terrorists who want to take over the country. However, at times he finds himself in the awkward {{position}} of siding with the Muslim community, as evidenced in the first season. A flashback episode revealed that his distrust of Muslims stems more from an unpleasant encounter with Baber than from any <b>deeply</b> <b>held</b> prejudices. His radio rants are primarily a ratings-grabbing persona; while he can be a blowhard jerk on and off the air, he treats pretty much everyone with equal condescension (not just Muslims). By season 3, it is revealed that his objectionable comments {{have more to do with}} habit and keeping ratings up, than any active dislike of Muslims. In fact, when he believes he is dying, he is downright friendly to everyone (including Muslims) and almost declares his love to Fatima. She graciously allows him his dignity when he claims it is in fact her hummus that he loves. Fred Tupper is also a divorcee.|$|E

Church leaders instruct their followers to avoid mainstream commercialism and the belief in absolute truths. The group holds that the quality of [...] "Slack" [...] is of utmost importance—it is never clearly defined. The number of followers is unknown, although the Church's message has been welcomed by college students and artists in the United States. The group is often compared to Discordianism. Journalists often consider the Church to be an elaborate joke, but a few academics have defended it as an honest system of <b>deeply</b> <b>held</b> beliefs.|$|E

500|$|This lack {{of clarity}} about Henry's control over events {{has contributed to the}} {{variation}} in the qualities ascribed to him: religious conservative or dangerous radical; lover of beauty or brutal destroyer of priceless artefacts; friend and patron or betrayer of those around him; chivalry incarnate or ruthless chauvinist. One traditional approach, favoured by Starkey and others, is to divide Henry's reign into two halves, the first Henry being dominated by positive qualities (politically inclusive, pious, athletic but also intellectual) who presided over a period of stability and calm, and the latter a [...] "hulking tyrant" [...] who presided over a period of dramatic, sometimes whimsical, change. Other writers have tried to merge Henry's disparate personality into a single whole; Lacey Baldwin Smith, for example, considered him an egotistical borderline neurotic given to great fits of temper and deep and dangerous suspicions, with a mechanical and conventional, but <b>deeply</b> <b>held</b> piety, and having at best a mediocre intellect.|$|E
500|$|Biographer Lawrence Sutin {{stated that}} [...] "blatant bigotry is a {{persistent}} minor element in Crowley's writings".

Crowley insulted his close Jewish friend Victor Neuburg using anti-Semitic slurs and he had mixed opinions about Jews as a group. Although he praised their [...] "sublime" [...] poetry and stated that they exhibited [...] "imagination, romance, loyalty, probity and humanity", he also thought that centuries of persecution had led some Jews to exhibit [...] "avarice, servility, falseness, cunning and the rest".

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the {{deposition}} of 99 Tcm-DTPA aerosol in the components of a jet nebulizer-based aerosol production system. Three impaction devices were compared: a ball-bearing separator, a virtual impactor and a step separator. In addition a comparison {{was made of}} two types of tubing which carried aerosol from nebulizer to mouthpiece: corrugated and smooth-walled tubing. The retention of aerosol following inhalation was measured in five normal volunteers using different patterns of breathing. Using an aerosol production system which included a ball-bearing separator only a mean of 11 % of the radioactivity loaded into the nebulizer was emitted as an aerosol. Some 18 % remained in the ball-bearing separator. The ball-bearing and step separators produced similar total outputs (7 % and 6 % minimum), the step separator producing marginally higher mean output/min. The virtual impactor produced a lower output than the other two impactors studied, only 1 %. A larger proportion of the aerosol output was deposited on corrugated tubing (7 %) compared with smooth-walled tubing (1 %). The retained fraction of the aerosol inhaled by subjects ranged from 16 % to 43 %. A higher fraction was retained when subjects inhaled <b>deeply</b> and <b>held</b> their breath for 10 s between each breath.

40|$|Like {{a fashion}} trend {{traveling}} from New York to the heartland, soul-searching about causality {{has made its}} way from empirical research in economics to that in political science with the usual lag. Gone {{are the days when}} it is enough to have a nice theory, a conditional correlation, and some rhetoric about the implausibility of competing explanations while implying but assiduously avoiding the “c ” word. Editors, reviewers, and search committees are beginning to look for more explicit and careful empirical treatments of causality. That is, following a definition of causality tracing back to Mill (1848), researchers are expected to lay out a set of possible outcomes, or counterfactuals, generated by a set of determinants, and demonstrate that holding all possible determinants except one at a constant level, the manipulation of that determinants is associated with a specific change in outcome, which can be deemed a causal effect (Heckman 2005).

Instead {{of being a}} snug fit, it is a loose fit, or a partial fit. Secondly, the caput or acetabulum are not smooth and round, but are misshapen, causing abnormal wear and tear or friction within the joint as it moves.The body reacts to this in several ways. First, the joint itself is continually repairing itself and laying down new cartilage. However, cartilage repair is a relatively slow process, the tissue being avascular, so the joint may suffer degradation due to the abnormal wear and tear, or may not support the body weight as intended. The joint becomes inflamed and a cycle of cartilage damage, inflammation and pain commences. This is a self-fueling process, in that the more the joint becomes damaged, the less able it is to resist further damage. The inflammation causes further damage. The bones of the joint may also develop osteoarthritis, visible on an X-ray as small outcrops of bone, which further degrade the joint. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease marked by the breakdown of cartilage between joints resulting in painful bone-to-bone contact.|$|R
