Therefore, to present the comparison, the process is simulated for bulk forming using finite element method (FEM) to obtain the results of cup <b>drawing</b> <b>process.</b> Afterwards, these results are compared with the given experimental results of micro scale process to help in order to establish a model for micro deep <b>drawing</b> <b>process.</b> To simulate the bulk process, specimens are scaled up to 10 times in comparison with micro scale specimens, considering that micro scale size dependencies begin at 0. 1 mm. It can be observed that these micro scale size effects cause a discontinuity in the properties of the material and the process itself which makes micro scale results, quite different from bulk results. Afterward, to make the comparison, micro scale results are extracted from given experimental data.

40|$|Abstract The cup {{drawing is}} a basic deep <b>drawing</b> <b>process.</b> Thus, {{understanding}} {{the mechanics of the}} cup <b>drawing</b> <b>process</b> helps in determining the general parameters that affect the deep <b>drawing</b> <b>process.</b> There are mainly two methods of analysis; experimental and analytical/numerical. Experimental analysis can be useful in analyzing the process to determine the process parameters that produce a defect free product. However, experimental work is usually very expensive and time consuming to perform. On the other hand, the Analytical/Numerical modeling can be used to model and analyze the process through all stages of deformation. This approach is less time consuming and more economical than experimental analysis. There have been several efforts to solve and analyze the deep drawing problem. Among these are the attempts to analyze the cup <b>drawing</b> <b>process,</b> by few researches who developed analytical models for the cup <b>drawing</b> <b>process</b> to solve for stresses and strains over the deforming sheet metal. However, they did not explain how to determine the moving boundaries in the deforming sheet [...] This paper deals with the analysis of deep drawing of circular blanks into axi-symmetric cylindrical cups forming using numerical modeling. A rigid plastic material model with the variational approach is used for this analysis.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{determination}} of the cold low diameter wire (diameter less than 0. 1 mm) <b>drawing</b> <b>process</b> parameters for hardly deformable biocompatible magnesium alloys by using the mathematical mesoscale model is described in the paper. The originality of the considered alloys (MgCa 0. 8, Ax 30) is the intergranular fracture mechanism associated with small strains (0. 07 - 0. 09). In previous authors works it was proven that the material state directly before appearance of the microcracks is in the optimal state {{from the point of}} view of the recovery of the plasticity by annealing. The forecasting of this material state in <b>drawing</b> <b>process</b> requires the development of the model of intergranular fracture initiation and using this model in two cases: – modeling of the in-situ tests, what allows calibrating and validating of the model; – modeling of the <b>drawing</b> <b>process,</b> what allows optimizing of the drawing parameters. A new model of the microcracks initiation in mesoscale using the boundary element method is proposed. The in-situ tests, which allowed observing the microstructure evolution during deformation, are used for the calibration and validation purpose.

40|$|In a fiber {{spinning}} process molten polymer is extruded into a fiber. The resulting fiber known as as-spun fiber is relatively weak and shows a large plastic central zone in its constitutive behavior. As {{a result the}} fiber deforms substantially without {{a significant change in}} load thus making it unsuitable for stress bearing applications. The range of plastic deformation is related to the natural draw ratio. In order to improve the mechanical properties of as spun fibers, {{fiber spinning}} is followed by a fiber <b>draw</b> <b>process.</b> With multi stage draw the as-spun fiber is drawn beyond the plastic region in various drawing zones which produces greater orientation of the polymer chains in the axial direction of the fiber thus enhancing mechanical strength characteristics of the fiber. The multistage <b>draw</b> <b>process</b> consists of several rollers each rotating at a speed greater than the one prior to it. The objective of this work is to develop a first approximation to model fiber draw in the multistage <b>drawing</b> <b>process,</b> with and without a draw pin. As the first step the slippage of fibers on rollers was analysed by including centrifugal acceleration and acceleration due to stretching. The draw in a free span is also modelled.
