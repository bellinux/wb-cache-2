5|$|Baseball had {{for some}} time been living uneasily in the {{knowledge}} that bribes were being offered by gamblers, and that some players were accepting them. The players knew <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> and the owners knew <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> But more important, the players knew that the owners knew—and they knew the owners were doing nothing about it for fear of a scandal that might damage organized baseball. Under such conditions it quite obviously did not pay to be honest.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the strike}} began (and perhaps while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on),</b> some miners {{proposed}} sending a {{delegation to the}} capital, Bucharest, to discuss their problems with {{the leadership of the}} Romanian Communist Party, but this option was discarded as they probably thought any split to two locations would fatally undermine their cause. During the pre-strike period and just as the strike began, certain of the sectoral party chiefs who obstructed the miners' efforts were verbally and even physically assaulted by the miners.|$|E
500|$|In 1913, Haywood was {{involved}} in the Paterson silk strike. Haywood and approximately 1,850 strikers were arrested {{during the course of the}} strike. Despite the long holdout and fundraising efforts, the strike ended in failure on July 28, 1913. [...] Haywood again made headlines, however, when the IWW staged the Paterson Strike Pageant at Madison Square Garden, in which actual strikers appeared onstage as themselves re-enacting the strike even as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in Paterson. [...] Haywood became a celebrity in progressive circles and began frequenting the intellectual salon of Mabel Dodge Luhan where, while often wearing his Stetson hat, he hobnobbed with writers and artists of the avant-garde.|$|E

2500|$|Whether Wilson truly {{consents}} to his semi-regular touring schedule {{since the}} 2000s {{is a subject}} of debate among fans. In 2011, after speaking to some of Wilson's acquaintances, biographer Jon Stebbins speculated that [...] "Working {{in the studio and}} especially touring is not really his choice. His handlers, managers, and wife insist that he work. It's all a bit Landy-like when you look behind the curtain." [...] Although Wilson often says that he enjoys touring, Stebbins writes of a [...] "recent interview [...] what he disliked the most about touring, Brian replied that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> stage and performing. ... Upon hearing Brian say that, his 'handler' quickly reminded Brian, through a fake smile, that he loved performing".|$|E
2500|$|Rosberg {{called his}} race as [...] "the toughest of the year" [...] and deemed it {{worse than the}} British Grand Prix when he retired from a gearbox failure. He stated that his car's {{reliability}} needed the most attention and wanted to understand the problem: [...] "It’s tough not even leaving the grid. I was hoping the team could fix it [...] because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> and off, sometimes working, sometimes not. There’s no point in shouting, it’s a reliability issue, and it’s happened again." [...] Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff apologised to Rosberg immediately following the competitor's retirement, saying as a championship participant, it is [...] "a bitter moment" [...] when that person loses ground in the battle {{and that there was}} nothing much to say in this situation. He later stated {{he did not want to}} see the championship being decided on reliability problems and that Mercedes needed to refocus and discover the origin of their problems. The team's technical director Paddy Lowe added reliability concerns worried him throughout the season and hoped it would not be repeated in the future.|$|E

6000|$|He answered: [...] "Not much; {{only that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> with varying success, and would {{continue}} to do so until the nations involved therein were exhausted," [...] or so he believed. The war did not seem greatly to interest Oro. It was, he remarked, but a small affair compared to those which he had known in the old days. Then he departed, and I went to sleep.|$|E
60|$|The {{spectacles}} {{which were}} exhibited in such buildings as these were usually combats, either {{of men with}} men, or of men with wild beasts. These were real combats, in which either the men or the beasts were actually killed.
