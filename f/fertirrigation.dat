The experimental design was a randomized block design with a factorial statistical arrangement 2 x 5 factorial (2 percentages of substrate base saturation x 5 combinations between the methods of <b>fertirrigation)</b> with 4 repetitions and 7 plants by portion. The substrate base saturation (V%) established was from 20 % to 40 % and the <b>fertirrigation</b> was provided by a leaf cistern and directly in the substrate, following these proportions: 100 % leaf cistern, 75 % leaf cistern and 25 % substrate, 50 % leaf cistern and 50 % substrate, 25 % leaf cistern and 75 % substrate and 100 % substrate. The plants were conducted in vase number 11, 15 and 17, and in each change of vases, it was evaluated the plant height, the rosette diameter, the stalk diameter, the number of leaves and the leaf width. The dry phytomass and leaf area were determined in the vase changes 15 and 17. Moreover, the root exploration and the inclination degree of the plants were determined in the end of the cultivation in vase 17. As conclusion, substrate base saturation greater than 20 % damages the growth of Aechmea fasciata plants. The best development of the aerial and root part of Aechmea fasciata plants were achieved when 75 % of the nutritive solution is applied via cistern and 25 % via substrate...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we use the maximum overlap {{discrete}} packet transform (MODWPT) to investigate the impact of historical <b>fertirrigation</b> treatments and cropping on wheat yield. Our objective was to identify the spatial frequencies at which such effects can be detected. Here we consider wheat yield data harvested in consecutive 0. 5 m &times; 0. 5 m-sections along the transect. Prior to the wheat crop, a split plot design experiment {{had been done to}} investigate the effect of different <b>fertirrigation</b> treatments on melon yield. The wheat transect crossed 9 of the subplots from the melon crop experiment. Each subplot had received a different level of applied nitrogen. The melons were grown at a 1. 5 m spacing and will have removed a proportion of the available nitrogen, leaving a soil nitrogen residual. We expect soil properties, such as available nitrogen, to be spatially variable as they result from spatially variable factors operating over multiple orders of spatial frequency. In this example we have good reason to believe this: the applied nitrogen changed from subplot to subplot constituting a low frequency factor, and we expected the removal of nitrogen by the melon crop to be a localized effect in the neighbourhood of the plant therefore constituting a higher frequency factor. We chose to use the MODWPT in this analysis as it is ideally suited to the elucidation of multifrequency processes that are not necessarily stationary in the variance. We show that the applied nitrogen dominates the wheat yield response, {{and that there is a}} noticeable contribution to wheat yield variation at the frequency that corresponds to the melon cropping. However the correlation analysis suggests that the relationship between wheat yield and melon positioning is not as straightforward as we might expect and that other influences affect wheat yield variation at this frequency...|$|E

40|$|The use of drip {{irrigation}} and marginal water is growing rapidly in some areas, highlighting {{the need to}} develop sound fertigation practices that combine environmental and crop production concerns. In this study the spatial and temporal water and solute distribution patterns are characterized to underpin <b>fertirrigation</b> design and management systems. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes were used to monitor the distributions of potassium nitrate (KNO 3) and water from drippers discharging at a constant flow rate of 4 L h- 1 in soil-filled containers. In the interactions between the different profiles, a gradient distribution of the solution in the soil was observed, with greater storage of solution close to the dripper, which decreased gradually as it approached the wetting front.

40|$|O presente trabalho teve por objetivo o aproveitamento da água residuária proveniente de um sistema biológico de tratamento de esgotos domésticos como alternativa à fertirrigação convencional de viveiros florestais, visando a produção de mudas de Croton floribundus (capixingui) e Copaifera langsdorffii (Copaíba) via subirrigação. As variáveis avaliadas mensalmente foram altura e diâmetro do coleto da muda e, ao final do experimento, peso da matéria seca da parte aérea e da raiz, área foliar, razão parte aérea/ raiz, análise nutricional foliar, análises químicas do substrato antes e após o ensaio e análises nutricionais periódicas da água residuária. O crescimento das plantas, em geral, foi {{superior}} no tratamento convencional com adubos minerais. O desenvolvimento do sistema radicular foi favorecido no tratamento com água residuária, o que pode ser característica desejável para maior sobrevivência das mudas no campo. Os resultados mostraram que a água residuária pode ser utilizada na fertirrigação de viveiros para produção das espécies estudadas, pois todas as plantas se mostraram vigorosas, com bom desenvolvimento, sem mortalidade, deficiência ou toxidez. Entretanto, constatou-se que essas mudas necessitarão de um maior tempo no viveiro, quando comparadas com as produzidas com fertilizantes minerais. This work {{aimed to}} study the use of treated domestic wastewater from a biological treatment system as an alternative for a seedling-nursery conventional <b>fertirrigation</b> (irrigation fertilization) of Croton floribundus Spreng. (Euphorbiaceae) and Copaifera langsdorffii Desf. (Leguminosae Caesalpinioideae) production. The variables analyzed monthly were seedling height and diameter and shoot and root dry matter weight, leaf area, shoot/root ratio, leaf and substrate chemical status (before and after the experiment) and periodical waste water nutritional analyses. Plant growth was greater when chemical fertilizers were used, but root development was greater when treated wastewater was used (which was thought to promote increased survival in the field). The results showed that wastewater {{can be used for}} <b>fertirrigation</b> of tree nurseries, since all plants have demonstrated vigor and good development with no mortality, deficiency or toxicity symptoms.

40|$|Water {{management}} in the Pirapama River Basin in northeastern Brazil is affected by both water quantity and water quality constraints. The region is known for significant sugarcane-based ethanol production—which {{is key to the}} Brazilian economy and expected to grow dramatically under recent global changes in energy policy. Sugarcane production in the region {{goes hand in hand with}} controlled <b>fertirrigation</b> practices with potentially significant adverse impacts on the environment. To assess sustainable water allocation in the basin, an integrated hydrologic-economic basin model is adapted to study both water quantity and water quality aspects. The model results show that incorporating water quality aspects into water allocation decisions leads to a substantial reduction in application of vinasse to sugarcane fields. To enforce water quality restrictions, the shadow price for maintaining water in the reservoir could be used as a pollution tax for fertirrigated areas, which are currently not subject to pollution charges.
