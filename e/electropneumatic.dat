25|$|The Gallery Organ {{is easily}} {{recognised}} from its unusual asymmetric façade – only the central organ case is original, {{the left and}} right wings added by Navaratnam. The action, once <b>electropneumatic,</b> was converted to direct-electric. This caused occasional problems with non-sounding notes and ciphers, resulting from the ingress of dirt into an open building and the general humidity. In the latest rebuilding of the organ, a new tracker action was built to replace the electric action. It is to date, the oldest playable organ in Singapore and is still regularly used for Masses.|$|E
50|$|The Ion is an <b>electropneumatic</b> paintball marker {{manufactured}} by Smart Parts. At {{the time of}} its release, the Ion was the first fully <b>electropneumatic</b> marker to target entry-level players, at a price point previously inhabited only by Spyders and other mechanical blowbacks. The Ion has generally been credited with making high-rate-of-fire <b>electropneumatic</b> markers available to the masses, at a time when <b>electropneumatic</b> markers were considered out of reach of most casual or budget players.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{also worth}} noting that while these two markers {{essentially}} tied for first <b>electropneumatic</b> markers to market, both designs were pre-dated (by years in some cases) {{by a series of}} homemade <b>electropneumatic</b> [...] "kits" [...] that modified pre-existing markers such as the Autococker or Sterling.|$|E

5000|$|In fully <b>electropneumatic</b> designs, {{there are}} two primary {{mechanism}} types: ...|$|E
50|$|Fully {{automatic}} markers fire continually {{when the}} trigger is pressed. The Tippmann SMG 60 {{was the first}} fully automatic paintball marker. Most <b>electropneumatic</b> paintball guns feature this mode. The fully automatic mode {{can be added to}} any <b>electropneumatic</b> marker by installing a customized logic board, or buying a completely new electronic trigger frame.|$|E
5000|$|The Shocker is {{a series}} of <b>electropneumatic</b> paintball markers {{manufactured}} by Smart Parts. The original Shocker was built by PneuVentures and distributed by Smart Parts in the US in 1995. It is now discontinued, but was the first <b>electropneumatic</b> paintball marker on the market at the time. [...] Several revisions of the marker have since been produced.|$|E
50|$|Instead of {{the spring}} and hammer used to actuate the valve and cycle the bolt {{assembly}} in mechanical markers, <b>electropneumatic</b> markers use the rerouting of air to different locations in the marker. This rerouting is controlled by a solenoid that is activated by the trigger. The two types of bolt and valve mechanisms in <b>electropneumatic</b> markers are the poppet-valve and spool-valve.|$|E
50|$|Paintball markers {{fall into}} two main {{categories}} in terms of mechanism - mechanical and <b>electropneumatic.</b>|$|E
50|$|An <b>electro{{pneumatic}}</b> paintball marker is a paintball marker {{that uses}} a pneumatic solenoid to actuate the hammer and/or bolt's movement.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Electropneumatic</b> tools use {{a variety}} of chucks for {{attaching}} chisels, but the most common are SDS-max, 7/8" [...] Hex, TE-S, and 1-1/8" [...] Hex. The connection end size is also related to the breaking energy of the tool. For example, the Bosch and Hilti 12 lb tools both use SDS-max, while the Bosch, Hilti, and Makita 65 lbs tools all use 1-1/8" [...] Hex connection. (See Wikipedia article on hammer drills for more on <b>electropneumatic</b> hammering) ...|$|E
50|$|Once {{a common}} sight at {{professional}} paintball tournaments (especially in the early- to mid-1990s), its popularity has since waned with the rise in popularity of <b>electropneumatic</b> markers.|$|E
5000|$|The Intimidator (or Timmy for short) is an <b>electropneumatic</b> paintball marker {{that was}} {{manufactured}} by former professional paintball player Bob Long and his company, Bob Long Technologies.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to fully <b>electropneumatic</b> marker designs, electronic trigger frames, with a solenoid-controlled sear, can be fit to most mechanical [...] "blow-back" [...] designs, {{such as the}} Kingman Spyder line of entry-level markers. These allow the high rates of fire seen in full <b>electropneumatic</b> designs at a very low cost compared to higher-level markers; however they typically have both the higher recoil of poppets (even worse, typically, as the designs use a traditional high-mass hammer driven forward by a spring) and relatively low gas efficiency due to a single operating pressure.|$|E
50|$|The Planet Eclipse Ego is an <b>electropneumatic,</b> open bolt stack tube paintball marker {{manufactured}} by Planet Eclipse,. The Ego {{was first introduced}} in late 2004 (as the 2005 model).|$|E
50|$|The organ was {{restored}} in 1965-66, when J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd of London overhauled the soundboards, installed a new console with <b>electropneumatic</b> action, {{and lowered the}} pitch.|$|E
50|$|The Angel {{is one of}} {{the first}} <b>electropneumatic</b> paintball markers. It was {{manufactured}} by Angel Paintball Sports (originally WDP) starting in 1997 and was introduced alongside Smart Parts' original Shocker.|$|E
50|$|The ICD Freestyle (abbreviated FS) is an <b>electropneumatic</b> paintball gun, or marker, made by Indian Creek Designs of Nampa, Idaho. Except {{for the air}} line, it {{is built}} {{completely}} of precision-machined aluminum.|$|E
50|$|Faiveley {{was awarded}} (late 2011/early 2012) {{contracts}} to supply brake equipement, including magnetic track brakes, and <b>electropneumatic</b> brake systems; {{as well as}} doors and air conditioning systems for the 130 unit intercity order.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the fire}} of 1965, a new {{sanctuary}} instrument by Austin Organs, Inc. was dedicated in 1967. It has 3 manuals, 47 stops, 61 ranks and <b>electropneumatic</b> action. The Austin Organ Opus 2465 stop list: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} of the Bushmaster 2000 {{is very similar to}} that of the Impulse, Intimidator or other poppet-valve based <b>electropneumatic</b> markers. The marker is classified as open-bolt, meaning the bolt is in the full-back position before the firing sequence.|$|E
50|$|The ICD ProMaster is an <b>electropneumatic</b> paintball marker {{manufactured}} by Indian Creek Designs and first released in 2005. The Promaster {{was designed to}} replace the aging Bushmaster 2000 model, which had been Indian Creek Design's flagship marker between 2000 and 2004.|$|E
5000|$|Introduced in 2000, it was, {{along with}} the Smart Parts Impulse, {{one of the first}} fully <b>electropneumatic</b> markers to be adopted by {{professional}} tournament teams on a widespread basis. There are over 28 versions of the Intimidator, spread over six [...] "generations." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{mechanical}} and poppet-based <b>electropneumatic</b> markers, the valve is usually {{designed to accommodate}} a specific operating pressure. Low pressure valves provide quieter operation and increased gas efficiency when tuned properly. However, excessively low pressure can decrease gas efficiency as dramatically as excessively high pressure.|$|E
5000|$|Each turboengine was {{equipped}} with a 3500-litre diesel tank for use on long routes, with a consumption of [...] for traction and [...] for passenger comfort. <b>Electropneumatic</b> braking was performed by cast-iron shoe-and-disc brakes, with electromagnetic track brakes under each bogie for emergency braking.|$|E
50|$|In 1960, {{the company}} {{returned}} to mechanical action technology (while continuing to build <b>electropneumatic</b> action instruments as well) {{and has since}} built over two hundred tracker action instruments {{ranging in size from}} a single manual portable Continuo of four stops to two, three, and four manual organs.|$|E
50|$|Vibe is {{the latest}} marker in Smart Part's low cost lineup, as it was {{released}} {{at the same time}} as the SP1, the EOS, and the Ion XE. It is an <b>electropneumatic</b> marker operating at approximately 180 PSI, similar to that of the Ion. It is also extremely inexpensive for an <b>electropneumatic</b> marker - it can be bought for $140. It doesn't include eyes, instead it has a low force bolt. With the low force bolt - chopping is nearly eliminated. The newer Vibe has 4 firing modes; tournament lock semi auto, semi auto, 3 shot burst, and fully automatic. The first batch of Vibes didn't include these modes and because of the upgrade so close after the release - Smart Parts will upgrade your non select fire board free of charge.|$|E
50|$|The {{design was}} the {{original}} blow forward paintball marker. The design is also used in many other markers. Currently available new markers that use the blow forward system are the Tiberius Arms line of markers, and the ICD Freestyles. The spool valve family of <b>electropneumatic</b> markers is also derived from this blow-forward operation.|$|E
50|$|WDP, LTD, {{and more}} {{recently}} doing business as Angel Paintball Sports, is a former manufacturer and distributor of paintball markers and equipment located in England. The company also owns and operates National Paintball Fields, a paintball playing site in Birmingham. WDP {{is best known for}} manufacturing the Angel line of <b>electropneumatic</b> paintball markers.|$|E
50|$|Slow rate of fire: In an {{era where}} <b>electropneumatic</b> markers are prized for their high rate of fire in both tournament and {{recreational}} play, the slower mechanical operation of the Autococker (at least in entry-level models) is looked upon with some disdain. The first production E-cocker conversion was the PMS mark 3 system in the late 90s, which met with minimal success but {{paved the way for}} offerings by Sandridge (fully electronic {{and one of the first}} electro's to use eye technology) and the centerflag Uprising (partial conversion). Next generation frames from Racegun and Eclipse (with multiple fire modes, fully electronic sear and pneumatics) were the first frames to find broad use and the Eclipse E-Blade became the standard for electro-cockers but was discontinued in 2006. WGP's own <b>electropneumatic</b> system, based on technology licensed from Planet Eclipse, is now standard on many of their new Autococker models.|$|E
50|$|AGD {{was slow}} to {{integrate}} electronics into its markers, however, and by the late 1990s, the rise of <b>electropneumatic</b> paintball markers caused the company to lose market share and slowly slip in prominence. In order to remain competitive, AGD introduced the E-mag and later, the X-mag line. AGD now focuses on manufacturing mechanical markers and equipment for scenario and woodsball players.|$|E
50|$|Poppet valves {{are easy}} to replace and require little maintenance. The {{downside}} to this design, however, is its high operating pressure, {{which leads to a}} larger recoil and less accuracy. Some markers have a separate firing and recocking sequence, which decreases the recoil caused by the cycling of the hammer. Markers with a hammer have a firing delay when compared to a full <b>electropneumatic.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the <b>electropneumatic</b> paintball marker {{is the subject of}} a patent dispute, but is {{generally}} acknowledged to have happened more or less simultaneously with the introduction of WDP's Angel and PneuVenture's Shocker, marketed by Smart Parts, both in 1996. The markers were operated differently; they were similar only to the extent that they both make use of one or more microswitch-controlled solenoid valves.|$|E
50|$|The torpedo was {{electric}} {{and had an}} effective range of 5700 metres at a speed of 24 knots (44 km/h). This torpedo employed passive acoustic homing to find its target, becoming active after a straight run of 400 metres. The homing mechanism consisted of two hydrophone receivers which sensed the sound waves of ship propellers and altered {{the direction of the}} rudder via an <b>electropneumatic</b> device.|$|E
