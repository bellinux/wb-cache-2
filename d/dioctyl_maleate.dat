40|$|Phthalate {{plasticizers}} such as di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) {{are being}} phased {{out of many}} consumer products because of their endocrine disrupting properties and their ubiquitous presence in the environment. The concerns raised {{from the use of}} phthalates have prompted consumers, government, and industry to find alternative plasticizers that are safe, biodegradable, and have the versatility for multiple commercial applications. We examined the toxicogenomic profile of mono(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP, the active metabolite of DEHP), the commercial plasticizer diisononyl cyclohexane- 1, 2 -dicarboxylate (DINCH), and three recently proposed plasticizers: 1, 4 -butanediol dibenzoate (BDB), dioctyl succinate (DOS), and <b>dioctyl</b> <b>maleate</b> (DOM), using the immortalized TM 4 Sertoli cell line. Results of gene expression studies revealed that DOS and BDB clustered with control samples while MEHP, DINCH and DOM were distributed far away from the control-DOS-BDB cluster, as determined by principle component analysis.

40|$|Endocrine disrupting {{chemicals}} (EDCs) are man-made compounds {{interfering with}} hormone signaling and thereby adversely affecting human health. Recent reports {{provide evidence for}} the presence of EDCs in commercially available bottled water, including steroid receptor agonists and antagonists. However, since these findings are based on biological data the causative chemicals remain unidentified and, therefore, inaccessible for toxicological evaluation. Thus, the aim {{of this study is to}} assess the antiestrogenic and antiandrogenic activity of bottled water and to identify the causative steroid receptor antagonists. We evaluated the antiestrogenic and antiandrogenic activity of 18 bottled water products in reporter gene assays for human estrogen receptor alpha and androgen receptor. Using nontarget high-resolution mass spectrometry (LTQ-Orbitrap Velos), we acquired corresponding analytical data. We combined the biological and chemical information to determine the exact mass of the tentative steroid receptor antagonist. Further MS(n) experiments elucidated the molecule's structure and enabled its identification. We detected significant antiestrogenicity in 13 of 18 products. 16 samples were antiandrogenic inhibiting the androgen receptor by up to 90 %. Nontarget chemical analysis revealed that out of 24520 candidates present in bottled water one was consistently correlated with the antagonistic activity. By combining experimental and in silico MS(n) data we identified this compound as di(2 -ethylhexyl) fumarate (DEHF). We confirmed the identity and biological activity of DEHF and additional isomers of <b>dioctyl</b> fumarate and <b>maleate</b> using authentic standards. Since DEHF is antiestrogenic but not antiandrogenic we conclude that additional, yet unidentified EDCs must contribute to the antagonistic effect of bottled water. Applying a novel approach to combine biological and chemical analysis this is the first study to identify so far unknown EDCs in bottled water. Notably, <b>dioctyl</b> fumarates and <b>maleates</b> have been overlooked by science and regulation to date. This illustrates the need to identify novel toxicologically relevant compounds to establish a more holistic picture of the human exposome...|$|R
