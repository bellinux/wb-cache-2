500|$|The Bavarian Ludwig Railway, {{which was}} the first {{passenger}} or freight rail line in the German lands, connected Nuremberg and Fürth in 1835. Although it was [...] long and only operated in daylight, it proved both profitable and popular. Within three years, [...] of track had been laid, by 1840, , and by 1860, [...] Lacking a geographically central organizing feature (such as a national capital), the rails were laid in webs, linking towns and markets within regions, regions within larger regions, and so on. As the rail network expanded, it became cheaper to transport goods: in 1840, 18 Pfennigs per ton per kilometer and in 1870, five Pfennigs. The effects of the railway were immediate. For example, raw materials could travel up and down the Ruhr Valley without having to unload and reload. Railway lines encouraged economic activity by creating demand for commodities and by facilitating commerce. In 1850, <b>inland</b> <b>shipping</b> carried three times more freight than railroads; by 1870, the situation was reversed, and railroads carried four times more. Rail travel changed how cities looked and how people traveled. Its impact reached throughout the social order, affecting the highest born to the lowest. Although some of the outlying German provinces were not serviced by rail until the 1890s, the majority of the population, manufacturing centers, and production centers were linked to the rail network by 1865.|$|E

40|$|For <b>inland</b> <b>ships,</b> {{state-of-the-art}} {{hull form}} design is {{to a large}} extent based on experience, common sense, or adjusting previous designs. The idea therefore arises that further optimization is possible if the right knowledge is available. This knowledge is insufficiently available due to two main reasons. First, research into <b>inland</b> <b>ship</b> optimization is usually omitted from the design process due to the high cost compared to the design budget. This has led to a lack of fundamental knowledge about the complex hydrodynamics around the hull of an <b>inland</b> <b>ship.</b> Second, as a consequence of omitting optimization research, adequate empirical power prediction methods have not been developed for <b>inland</b> <b>ships</b> {{due to the lack of}} data. In the Top Ships project, effort is put in the development of an empirical method for <b>inland</b> <b>ship</b> power estimation as well as the derivation of design guidelines. Both should aid designers in the process of a new ship's design. The present paper gives an overview of available information from literature that aids to design of <b>inland</b> <b>ships.</b> Design guidelines and power prediction methods that relate to the design of a new <b>inland</b> <b>ship</b> are presented and discussed.

40|$|This master thesis {{focuses on}} a systems {{comparison}} of intermodal transport concerning road and inland waterways. Moreover, the master thesis discusses and analyses the potential and importance of inland waterways for the inland transportation of containers from European sea ports to European markets. By doing so, {{the aim of the}} thesis was to highlight the parameters of the inland waterway system as well as cost parameters for <b>inland</b> <b>ships</b> carrying containers. The master thesis was compiled in order to answer the following questions properly: Can <b>inland</b> <b>ships</b> provide market-oriented and competitive solutions for the transportation of containers from sea ports to European markets and which cost parameters have {{to be taken into account}} for <b>inland</b> <b>ships</b> carrying containers? How does a river information system (RIS) support <b>inland</b> <b>ships</b> by making it more attractive for shippers and forwarders? Regarding transportation of containers from sea ports to inland, which parameters of the inland waterway system are of significance and determining? Applying intelligent information systems and planning techniques combined with a growing network of intermodal terminals, <b>inland</b> <b>ships</b> offer innovative and competitive solutions by being an integrated transport system, providing tailor-made and door-todoor logistics services. Considering that road and rail transport are already suffering from chronic congestion, inland waterways' key competitiveness lies in its congestionfree network. However, the infrastructure of the inland waterway network does only meet regionally the requirements for an efficient and seamless container transport and therefore hampers the potential of the inland waterway network as a whole.

40|$|Transport {{time and}} cost are decisive factors for shippers when they choose a mode for their transport. For inland {{waterway}} transport in particular, these aspects are more uncertain and less easy to generalize than for road and rail. This {{is due to the}} highly variable waterway conditions on free-flowing rivers and due to the large variety of <b>inland</b> <b>ships.</b> Today´s transport models, however, do not take these factors into account. This paper shows that dynamic fairway conditions, the ship’s amount of propulsion power, and the captain’s behaviour have a substantial impact on the attainable speed and fuel consumption of <b>inland</b> <b>ships.</b> This in turn has a significant impact on attainable sailing schedules and transportation cost, as we demonstrate through a case study for ships sailing on the Rhine-Danube corridor. We, therefore, conclude that there is a clear potential to improve the representation of {{inland waterway transport}} in freight models by modelling the effects of actual ship characteristics and waterway conditions at the micro-level. </p...|$|R
