After the routine maintenance was completed {{toward the end}} of the month, the ship attempted to break out into the Atlantic Ocean to raid merchant traffic. The engine oil <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> caught fire and was severely damaged. The fire forced the crew to shut down the ship's propulsion system until the blaze could be brought under control; this rendered Admiral Hipper motionless for several hours on the open sea. British reconnaissance failed to locate the ship, and after the fire was extinguished, the ship returned to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard, where repairs lasted slightly over a week.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of two <b>feeding</b> <b>systems</b> and two dairy cow breeds on milk yield and composition, {{physical}} and sensorial properties of Camembert and Pont-l'Eveque cheeses. The experiment consisted of a 2 X 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. A low energy grass diet with only 15 % of concentrate (LowGS) was compared with a high-energy maize silage diet with 30 % concentrate (HighMS). Thirty-four Holstein (Hp) and 34 Normande (No) cows in early lactation were {{assigned to one of}} two <b>feeding</b> <b>systems</b> for a 6 -week period Cows on the LowGS <b>feeding</b> <b>system</b> had lower milk yield, fat and protein content In both <b>feeding</b> <b>systems,</b> No cows had lower milk yields but higher milk protein contents than Ho cows. The LowGS <b>feeding</b> <b>system</b> altered milk fatty acid (FA) composition by reducing saturated FA. Breed had only a small impact on milk FA. Concerning milk coagulating properties, only the firmness was reduced by the LowGS feeding and the Ho breed. The effects of breed and <b>feeding</b> <b>system</b> on the protein content of cheeses were more marked in Camembert cheese than in Pont-l'Eveque cheese. However the Camembert cheese from Ho-LowGS was, in fact characterized especially by lower protein content. LowGS <b>feeding</b> <b>system</b> and No breed produced more yellow cheeses. <b>Feeding</b> <b>systems</b> had limited effects on the firmness of Camembert and Pont-l'Eveque cheeses measured by penetrometry. In sensory analysis, Ho breed and LowGS feeding produced a Camembert cheese with a more melting texture in the mouth due to the increase of spreadability index and of proteolysis. The type of cheese also had an influence: the effects were more important on Camembert cheese than on Pont-l'Eveque cheese. Only the Ho-LowGS treatment produced a very specific Camembert cheese different from the others. The <b>feeding</b> <b>systems</b> and breed of dairy cow have no determinant effect on PDO (protected designation of origin) Camembert and Pont-l'Eveque cheeses, especially regarding taste. In this kind of trial despite {{the effects of}} <b>feeding</b> <b>systems</b> and breed on milk composition, the role of cheese ripening and microbiology appears to be of considerable importance...|$|R

2500|$|The above {{described}} antennas {{with multiple}} driven elements require a complex <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> of signal splitting, phasing, distribution to the elements, and impedance matching. [...] A {{different sort of}} end-fire array {{which is much more}} often used is based on the use of so-called parasitic elements. In the popular high-gain Yagi antenna, only one of the dipoles is actually connected electrically, but the others receive and reradiate power supplied by the driven element. This time, the phasing is accomplished by careful choice of the lengths as well as positions of the parasitic elements, in order to concentrate gain in one direction and largely cancel radiation in the opposite direction (as well as all other directions). Although the realized gain is less than a driven array with the same number of elements, the simplicity of the electrical connections makes the Yagi more practical for consumer applications.|$|E

50|$|The {{key element}} of a vacuum filler is the vacuum filling principle. The filling product is fed into the <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> {{mechanically}} via a hopper with actively driven feeding auger, as well as via vertical “vacuum suction”. Pre-evacuated cells of a vane cell <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> move underneath the hopper. The pressure difference relative to the ambient pressure (underpressure) caused by the evacuation ensures that the cells are filled with product. The <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> moves continuously, thus generating a continuous filling flow. The product is portioned by means of cyclic movements of the <b>feed</b> <b>system.</b> Each cell of the <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> has a particular volume.

The portioning volume is therefore set in the control system by multiplying the rotor’s rotation distance by the number of the <b>feed</b> <b>system</b> cells within it. The portion weight must be determined in the control system via the portion volume parameter with the aid of scales.|$|E
