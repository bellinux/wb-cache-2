Zeleny showed experimentally that disintegration begins as a hydrodynamical instability, but his ideas about the mechanics of the situation rest on the implicit assumption that instability occurs when the internal pressure is the same as that outside the drop. It is shown that this assumption is false and that instability of an elongated drop would not occur unless a pressure difference existed. When this error is corrected it is found that a drop, elongated by an <b>electric</b> <b>field,</b> becomes unstable when its length is 1 - 9 times its equatorial diameter, and the calculated critical <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> agrees with laboratory experiments to within 1 %.

Contact resistance has been greatly reduced by using a heavily doped silicon-on-insulator layer as electrodes, compared with devices based on Al/SiNCs/Al structures. Traps with the activation energy of 147 and 103 meV have been found when SiNC channels are applied with high gate voltage.

40|$|Reactively {{sputtered}} ZnO {{thin film}} gas sensors were fabricated onto Si wafers. The atmosphere dependent electrical {{response of the}} ZnO micro arrays was examined. The effects of processing conditions on the properties and sensor performance of ZnO films were investigated. Using AFM, SEM, XRD and WDS, the 02 /Ar ratios during sputtering and Al dopant were found to control the property of ZnO films. Subsequent annealing at 700 C improved the sensor response of the films considerably although it had only minor effects on the microstructure. DC resistance, I-V curves and AC impedance were utilized to investigate the gas response of ZnO sensors. ZnO films prepared with high O 2 /Ar ratios showed better sensitivity to various gases, a feature <b>believed</b> to <b>be</b> related to their lower carrier density. Al doped ZnO showed measurable sensitivity even with lower resistance attributable to their porous microstructure. AC impedance identified two major components of the total resistance including Schottky barriers at the Pt-ZnO interfaces and a DC bias induced constriction resistance within the ZnO films. Time dependent drift in resistance of ZnO films has been observed. Without applied bias, the ZnO films showed a fast and a slow resistance change response when exposed to gases with varying oxygen partial pressure with both response components dependent on operating temperature. Even at the relatively low operating temperatures of these thin film sensors, bulk diffusion cannot be discounted. The oxygen partial pressure dependence of the sensor resistance and its corresponding activation energy were related to defect process controlling the reduction/oxidation behavior of the ZnO. (cont.) In this study, time dependent DC bias effects on resistance drift were first discovered and characterized. The DC bias creates particularly high <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> in these micro devices given that the spacing of the interdigited electrodes falls {{in the range of}} microns. The high <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> <b>believed</b> to initiate ion migration and/or modulate grain boundary barrier heights, inducing resistance drift with time.

30|$|The {{irregularities}} {{originate from}} plasma instability process that may {{develop in the}} nighttime ionosphere when conditions of the background ionosphere are favorable for their development. In the most typical scenario, the instability may develop through the Rayleigh-Taylor interchange mechanism (Dungey 1956) acting on the seed perturbations in density and polarization <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> produced by gravity waves at the bottom side of a rapidly rising post-sunset F layer. The rapid post-sunset rise of layer (PSSR) occurs through the enhanced vertical plasma drift arising from the evening prereversal enhancement in the zonal <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> (the PRE). The PRE is generated through {{the action of the}} F layer dynamo under sunset electrodynamics processes. The thermospheric zonal wind, which is eastward in the evening, produces vertical polarization <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> in the F region that has strong longitudinal gradient across the sunset terminator due to the decay in the E layer conductivity towards the nightside. This situation leads {{to the development of the}} PRE as explained by Rishbeth (1971) (see also Heelis et al. 1974; Farley et al. 1986; Eccles et al. 2015). Based on a TIECGM simulation study, a candid explanation of the PRE development was recently presented by Heelis et al. (2012). During low solar flux years, the PRE vertical drift velocity is relatively small, when therefore the role of an instability seed source may become relatively more important for the ESF development. The instability seeding through perturbations in electron density and polarization <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> <b>believed</b> to <b>be</b> provided by gravity waves propagating upward from sources of their likely generation in the tropospheric convective regions (see for example, Rottger 1981; Huang et al. 1993; McClure et al. 1998; Fritts and Vadas 2008; Abdu et al. 2009 a; Tsunoda 2010; Li et al. 2016). Once initiated at the F layer bottom side gradient region under sufficiently large linear growth rate condition, the instability may grow nonlinearly to topside ionosphere in the form of plasma-depleted magnetic field-aligned structures. These structures may cascade into a wide spectrum of scale sizes of irregularities (Haerendel 1973), the composite form of which is known by the generic name, the ESF irregularities, that are observable by a wide variety of diagnostic techniques. Being part of the coupled atmosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere system, they suffer variabilities due to different sources of forcing related to magnetospheric disturbances and lower atmospheric wave activities. As a result, large degrees of day-to-day and short-term variabilities mark the development and occurrence of the EPB/ESF irregularities, which constitute the prime focus of this paper.|$|R

In this article, we explore the use of lipophilic SHG probes to detect minute perturbations in the plasma membrane. Three candidate probes, Di- 4 -ANEPPDHQ (Di- 4), FM 4 - 64, and all-trans-retinol, were evaluated for SHG effectiveness in Jurkat cells. Di- 4 proved superior with both strong SHG signal and limited bleaching artifacts. To test whether rapid changes in membrane symmetry could be detected using SHG, we exposed cells to nanosecond-pulsed <b>electric</b> <b>fields,</b> which <b>are</b> <b>believed</b> to cause formation of nanopores in the plasma membrane. Upon nanosecond-pulsed <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> exposure, we observed an instantaneous drop of ∼ 50 % in SHG signal from the anodic pole of the cell. When compared to the simultaneously acquired fluorescence signals, it appears that the signal change was not due to the probe diffusing out of the membrane or changes in membrane potential or fluidity. We hypothesize that this loss in SHG signal is due to disruption in the interfacial nature of the membrane. The results show that SHG imaging has great potential as a tool for measuring rapid and subtle plasma membrane disturbance in living cells...|$|R

After that, micro-tip electrode arrays were utilized to develop electronic devices such as conductometric sensors and field effect transistors using dielectrophoretically deposited nanomaterials. To realize the ability of DEP forces for manipulating particles in stationary liquid, a DEP-microfluidic device with micro-tip electrodes was utilized to comprehensively investigate the DEP behaviors of polystyrene microparticles using different AC <b>electric</b> <b>fields.</b> In a further study, the separation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from polystyrene particles was demonstrated using the same system. In order to achieve the most efficient DEP manipulation within liquid flows, curved electrodes were developed. With devices that use such a design, the author successfully conducted the following tasks in flowing liquid: the separation of polystyrene microparticles from CNTs, controllable focusing of polystyrene microparticles, sorting of polystyrene particles according to their dimensions, sorting of live and dead cells, trapping of polystyrene particles using pre-patterned CNTs, and the development of optofluidic waveguide using dielectrophoretically controlled silica particles.

40|$|Abstract – A new {{theoretical}} approach {{was applied to}} model the Stark effect in the circular polarized <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> for rare gases He, Ne, Ar and Kr. Cal-culations of the shifts and splitting of the energy levels of rare gases in the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> <b>were</b> carried out with computer program package STARKD. The regularities of the shifts and splitting of the energy levels in the circular polarized <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> <b>are</b> studied. Dependencies of the dynamic Stark effect on the frequency and strength of the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> <b>are</b> investigated. The obtained results {{can be applied to}} the plasma produced by both a high-frequency discharge and an optical excitation. 1...|$|R
