50|$|The kettle design {{allows the}} griller to {{configure}} the grill for <b>indirect</b> <b>cooking</b> (or barbecuing) as well. For <b>indirect</b> <b>cooking,</b> charcoal is piled {{on one or}} {{both sides of the}} lower chamber and a water pan is placed in the empty space to one side or between the charcoal. Food is then placed over the water pan for cooking. The venting system consists of one or more vents {{in the bottom of the}} lower chamber and one or more vents in the top of the lid. Normally, the lower vent(s) are to be left open until cooking is complete, and the vent(s) in the lid are adjusted to control airflow. Restricted airflow means lower cooking temperature and slower burning of charcoal.|$|E
50|$|The {{charcoal}} cart grill {{is quite}} similar in appearance to a typical gas grill. The cart grill can be rectangular or kettle in design, has a hinged lid, cooking grid, charcoal grid, and is mounted to a cart with wheels and side tables. Most cart grills {{have a way}} to adjust heat, either through moving the cooking surface up, the charcoal pan down, through venting, or a combination of the three. Cart grills often have an ash collection drawer for easy removal of ashes while cooking. Their rectangular design makes them usable for <b>indirect</b> <b>cooking</b> as well. Charcoal cart grills, with all their features, can make charcoal grilling nearly as convenient as gas grilling. Cart grills can also be quite expensive.|$|E
40|$|Applicability of {{selected}} marine and freshwater fish and squid for snack food manufacture by <b>indirect</b> extrusion <b>cooking</b> was evaluated. Formulations consisting of various cereals and meat were extruded with a 20 -DN single-screw laboratory extruder (Brabender, Germany). Meat of lean fish showed better extrusion characteristics {{than that of}} fat fish, fresh fish being superior in this respect to frozen fish. Washing of the fish meat was found to enhance meat utility in extrusion cooking. Myofibrilar proteins of cod proved most useful protein fraction to extrusion...|$|R
50|$|In December 1956, the Toshiba Corporation {{placed the}} first commercially {{successful}} automated electric rice cookers on the market. It used a double-chamber <b>indirect</b> rice <b>cooking</b> method. Rice was placed into the rice pot, and {{water into a}} surrounding container. When {{the water in the}} outer pot boiled off, the temperature of the pot rose rapidly. A bimetallic thermostat then activated, and automatically turned off the cooker to prevent burning of the cooked rice. Soon, Toshiba was producing 200,000 rice cookers per month for the Japanese market. Four years later, rice cookers could be found in half of Japanese homes.|$|R
50|$|This {{method of}} <b>cooking,</b> known as <b>indirect</b> (or convection) <b>cooking</b> {{is also used}} by {{traditional}} charcoal and wood smokers. That similarity, {{and the fact that}} wood pellets produce smoke that flavors food, resulted in many early adopters turning to pellet grills as an easy-to-use alternative to traditional smokers. Joe Traeger worked to combine the best elements of gas and charcoal grills. The Traeger Grill revolutionized smoking by bringing the ability to slow-cook authentic BBQ to the masses with simplicity and convenience. Like a gas grill, Traeger Grills has a continuous fuel source—once the hopper is loaded with pellets, the auger repeatedly and automatically feeds them into the fire pot at predetermined intervals. The ability to cook at a relatively consistent temperature for hours without tending physical coal or wood fires appealed to BBQers who had become accustomed to tending smokers during long day or overnight cooks.|$|R
5000|$|The double-chamber <b>indirect</b> <b>cooking</b> model {{took more}} time to {{complete}} cooking and also consumed more electricity. This model was gradually phased out in the 1960s, {{but there are some}} companies, such as Tatung, that still manufacture them. Today, electric rice cookers utilize an insulated outer container and an inner removable bowl, often coated with a non-stick surface, and stamped with water-level graduations marked in cups of rice used. The rice cup measure is normally based on the traditional Japanese measurement system 1 [...] (gō), which has its origin in China (...) [...] One [...] is 180 ml, or approximately 25% smaller than the American measuring cup of 8 (US) fluid ounces/240 ml, and is regarded as producing enough cooked rice for a single meal for one person.|$|E
50|$|Like most {{traditional}} smokers, early pellet grills {{were limited to}} <b>indirect</b> <b>cooking</b> methods such as smoking, roasting, and baking. However, thanks to improvements in construction and advancements in digital controllers, modern pellet grills can produce higher temperatures. Whereas early units struggled to reach 450 °F, some pellet grills can now easily achieve temperatures in excess of 550 °F. Louisiana Grills, Fast Eddy's by Cookshack, and Yoder Smokers YS Series have pellet grills with an upper limit of 600 °F. Some pellet grills can reach 600-700 °F, depending on the model. The ability to achieve high temperatures has enabled some manufacturers to design pellet grills that can handle both indirect and direct cooking. Brands such as Memphis Wood Fire Grills, Fast Eddy’s by Cookshack, Louisiana Grills, Yoder Smokers, and FireCraft make pellet grills that offer the option of open fire grilling.31 This is usually accomplished through a removable or adjustable plate that allows flames through {{a portion of the}} pellet grill's deflector plate.|$|E
