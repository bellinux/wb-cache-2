500|$|SSI {{had already}} {{published}} many RPGs based on original properties. Its [...] "hardcore" [...] RPG Wizard's Crown (1985) presaged the Gold Box games' design, with eight-character parties, a skill-based experience system, highly detailed combat mechanics, dozens of commands, injuries and bleeding, and {{strengths and weaknesses}} versus <b>individual</b> <b>weapon</b> classes. The game did not, however, offer much in terms of role-playing or narrative beyond buying, selling and killing. Wizard's Crown was followed by The Eternal Dagger in 1987, a similar game that removed some of its predecessor's more complicated elements.|$|E
