5000|$|Annular mist flow {{occurs at}} high gas velocities. A thin film of liquid is present around the annulus of the pipe. Typically {{most of the}} liquid is entrained {{in the form of}} {{droplets}} in the gas core. As a result of gravity, there is usually a thicker film of liquid {{on the bottom of the}} pipe as opposed to the top of the pipe. [...] Stratified (smooth) flow exists when the gravitational separation is complete. The liquid flows along the bottom of the pipe as gas flows over the top. Liquid holdup in this regime can be large but the gas velocities are low. [...] Stratified wave flow is similar to stratified smooth flow, but with a higher gas velocity. The higher gas velocity produces waves on the liquid surface. These waves may become large enough to break off liquid droplet at the peaks of the waves and become entrained in the gas. These droplets are distributed further down the pipe. [...] Slug flow is where large frothy waves of liquid form a slug that can fill the pipe completely. These slugs may also be in the form of a surge wave that exists upon a thick film of liquid on the bottom of the pipe. [...] Elongated bubble flow consists of a mostly liquid flow with elongated bubbles present closer to the top of the pipe. [...] <b>Dispersed</b> <b>flow</b> assume a pipe is completely filled with liquid with a small amount of entrained gas. The gas is in the form of smaller bubbles. These bubbles of gas have a tendency to reside in the top region of the pipe as gravity holds the liquid in the bottom of the pipe.|$|E

The <b>flow</b> field characteristics are of additional importance. For most concentrated food systems containing a disperse phase, the <b>dispersing</b> <b>flow</b> field in any apparatus is laminar. However the ratio of shear and elongational laminar flow contributions influences the dispersing efficiency strongly. Beside disperse components most multiphase food systems contain also macromolecular stabilizing components in the continuous phase as well as surfactants at the interfaces.

In a previous work at MIT, a model of <b>dispersed</b> <b>flow</b> heat transfer was developed, called the Local Conditions Solution, which is amenable to hand calculation of wall temperatures. This solution identifies a single nonequilibrium parameter which depends solely on conditions at dryout, particularly a characteristic droplet diameter. Previous to the current study, no simple model including mechanisms occurring upstream of dryout had succeeded in predicting the droplet distribution at dryout. The Local Conditions Solution is rederived to identify which droplet diameter characterizes the distribution of droplets at dryout for purposes of <b>dispersed</b> <b>flow</b> heat transfer analysis. Based on mechanisms of droplet entrainment and deposition, the dryout droplet distribution is derived. This distribution is integrated to obtain the characteristic droplet diameter. A simple method of calculating the characteristic droplet diameter is presented. With the droplet distribution model, the Local Conditions Solution is compared with three correlations and seven data sets. In general, the Local Conditions Solution predicts wall temperature data to within about 5 % better than the three correlations.

40|$|Waste {{stabilization}} ponds (WSPs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} prevalent types of domestic wastewater treatment technologies employed worldwide, and global stressors such as urbanization, population growth, climate change, and water scarcity have increased the demand for reusing treated wastewater. The safe reuse of treated wastewater in agriculture can ease water scarcity, aid in food production, and reduce environmental degradation from the discharge of wastewater effluent to surface waters. The ability to predict virus concentrations in wastewater effluent is an important criterion for determining whether wastewater is suitable for discharge to the environment or for reuse in agriculture. However, many uncertainties remain about virus removal efficiency in WSPs and there is currently no mechanistic or empirical model that reliably predicts virus removal in WSPs. The overall objective of this thesis research was to model the extent of virus removal in individual waste stabilization ponds to support the reuse of wastewater. A literature review was used to create a database of estimated apparent virus removal rate coefficients (Kv,app) in three different WSP types (anaerobic, facultative, and maturation ponds). The database consisted of 249 paired influent and effluent concentrations of enteric viruses or bacteriophages from 44 unique WSP systems, comprised of 112 individual WSPs from 19 different countries. Apparent virus removal rate coefficients (Kv,app) were calculated for each individual WSP using the following three mathematical models from reactor theory: complete mix, plug flow, and <b>dispersed</b> <b>flow.</b> Pearson’s correlation analysis was used to determine correlations between Kv,app values and the following design, operational, and environmental parameters: solar radiation, air temperature, pond depth, hydraulic retention time (HRT), and virus loading rates. The median Kv,app values were greater for anaerobic ponds than for facultative and maturation ponds; however, Kv,app values in facultative and maturation ponds had more significant correlations with design, operational, and environmental parameters. Additionally, Kv,app values appear to be significantly different for various types of enteric viruses and bacteriophages. Alternative multiple linear regression equations were developed to predict Kv,app values using the design, operational, and environmental parameters as explanatory variables. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used to select the most appropriate multiple linear regression equations with the least amount of explanatory variables. The most appropriate plug flow and <b>dispersed</b> <b>flow</b> multiple linear regression equations for predicting Kv,app values included air temperature and HRT as explanatory variables. The results indicate that the plug flow regression equation was able to better predict Kv,app values (R 2 = 0. 38) than the <b>dispersed</b> <b>flow</b> regression equation (R 2 = 0. 24) in facultative and maturation ponds based on the dataset. However, both the <b>dispersed</b> <b>flow</b> and plug flow models had R 2 values of approximately 0. 84 when they were used to predict effluent virus concentrations in facultative and maturation ponds based on the dataset. According to this research, the plug flow regression equation is recommended for predicting apparent virus removal rate coefficients in WSPs. However, a multi-model approach that utilizes both the plug flow and <b>dispersed</b> <b>flow</b> models may yield a more robust mathematical model that can improve WSP design, reliably predict virus removal in WSPs, and ultimately be used to support wastewater reuse...|$|E

The use of the segmented flow process, in this case, is challenging due to the very low interfacial tension of 4 mN/m at room temperature between potassium tert. -butyl peroxide and pivaloyl chloride, which causes an unstable fluid interface and results in a broad segment length distribution. This low interfacial tension is further decreased by the heat of reaction (126 kJ/mol pivaloyl chloride [1]), which is partially released at the contacting point of both fluids.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the experimental and theoretical investigations {{on the development}} of phase inversion in horizontal pipeline flow of two immiscible liquids. It aims to provide an understanding on the flow development across the phase inversion transition as well as the effect on pressure drop. Experimental investigation on phase inversion and associated phenomena were conducted in a 38 mm I. D. liquid pipeline flow facility available in the Department of Chemical Engineering at University College London (UCL). Two sets of test pipelines are constructed using stainless steel and acrylic. The inlet section of the pipeline has also been designed in two different configurations – (1) Y-junction inlet to allow <b>dispersed</b> <b>flow</b> to be developed along the pipeline (2) Dispersed inlet to allow formation of dispersion immediately after the two phases are joined. Pressure drop along the pipeline is measured using a differential pressure transducer and is studied for changes due to redistribution of the phases during inversion. Various conductivity probes (ring probes, wire probes, electrical resistance tomography and dual impedance probe) are installed along the pipeline to detect the change in phase continuity and distribution as well as drop size distribution based on the difference in conductivity of the oil and water phases. During the investigation, the occurrence of phase inversion is firstly investigated and the gradual transition during the process is identified. The range of phase fraction at which the transition occurs is determined. The range of phase fraction becomes significantly narrower when the dispersed inlet is used. The outcome of the investigation also becomes the basis for subsequent investigation with the addition of glycerol to the water phase to reduce the interfacial tension. Based on the experimental outcome, the addition of glycerol does not affect the inversion of the oil phase while enhancing the continuity of the water phase. As observed experimentally, significant changes in pressure gradient can be observed particularly during phase inversion. Previous literatures have also reviewed that phase inversion occurs at the maximum pressure gradient. In a horizontal pipeline, pressure gradient is primarily caused by the frictional shear on the fluid flow in the pipe and, in turn, is significantly affected by the fluid viscosities. A study is conducted to investigate on the phase inversion point by identifying the maximum mixture viscosity (i. e. maximum pressure gradient) that an oil-in-water (O/W) and water-in-oil (W/O) dispersion can sustain. It is proposed that the mixture viscosity will not increase further with an increase in the initial dispersed phase if the inverted dispersion has a lower mixture viscosity. This hypothesis has been applied across a wide range of liquid-liquid dispersion with good results. This study however cannot determine the hysteresis effect which is possibly caused by inhomogeneous inversion in the fluid system. A mechanistic model is developed to predict the flow characteristics as well as the pressure gradient during a phase inversion transition. It aims to predict the observed change in flow pattern from a fully <b>dispersed</b> <b>flow</b> to a dual continuous flow during phase inversion transition. The existence of the interfacial height provides a selection criterion to determine whether a momentum balance model for homogeneous flow or a two-fluid layered flow should be applied to calculate the pressure gradient. A friction factor is also applied to account for the drag reduction in a <b>dispersed</b> <b>flow.</b> This developed model shows reasonable results in predicting the switch between flow patterns (i. e. the boundaries for the phase inversion transition) and the corresponding pressure gradient.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} to drops impacting {{on a hot}} surface is examined in context of dispersions of flowing, boiling fluids. The liquid contribution to heat transfer from a hot tube to a two-phase dispersion is formulated in terms of heat transfer contributions due to surface impacts of individual drops. High heat transfer rates are associated with liquid wetting of the surface at surface temperatures between saturation and the minimum stable film boiling (transition) temperature. Low heat transfer rates are associated with non-wetting, or dry, impacts at surface temperatures above the transition temperature. In the wetting region, experimental measurements of heat transfer rates to sparse streams of drops impacting on a hot surface showed complete evaporation of the drops. In the non-wetting region, an analysis of impact dynamics and heat transfer for deformable drops was performed using simple, idealized shapes to model the deformation. Lagrangian methods were used to derive equations of motion and deformation for impacting drops. Resulsts compare well with available information on drop dynamics and heat transfer. The analysis of heat {{transfer to}} impacting drops was formulated for incorporation into <b>dispersed</b> <b>flow</b> analysis, given the statistical distribution of drops in the dispersion. Applications include the prediction of local heat transfer and vapor generation rates. The liquid contribution to <b>dispersed</b> <b>flow</b> heat transfer must be included for the prediction of rewet in nonuniformly heated tubes. NSF D. S. R. Projec...|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of {{two phase flow}} has a great relevance in many industrial sectors such as nuclear and process industry. The study and the measurement of the related phenomena are particularly dicult due to the variety of the parameters that aect the flow (void fraction, flow regime, orientation, etc.). Measurement instrumentation for two phase flow is nowadays very limited even {{if it would be}} highly useful in the industrial field. Before approaching the research and development toward the realization of innovative instrumentation for two-phase flow measurement, it is fundamental a precise description of the particular flow regime of interest. Dispersed water droplets in air/gas is a possible flow regime at high gas void fractions; therefore it is important to characterize this particular flow pattern in a detailed way. To reproduce this condition in a laboratory environment it is possible to use nozzles with very small outlet diameters and high pressure water supply. In this paper the characterization of <b>dispersed</b> <b>flow</b> is performed as function of the nozzle characteristic and water inlet pressure. The tests are performed using an experimental setup realized at the Energy Department at Politecnico di Torino. The water jet is observed in a PMMA (PolyMethylMethacrylate) pipe 1. 8 meters long with an inner diameter of 78 mm. High pressure water is obtained using a plunger pump and pump inlet water pressure is adjustable in the range 1 - 4 bar. Water pressure upstream the nozzle and air entrainment flow rate are measured and used as primary parameters of the study. A sensitivity analysis on these two parameters is performed with the purpose to find the conditions that are optimal to reproduce a <b>dispersed</b> <b>flow...</b>|$|E

A phase diagram illustrating the drop break-up formation mechanism and size distribution {{as a function}} of disperse and continuous phase flow rate is presented. The drop break-up dynamic dominated by the <b>disperse</b> <b>flow</b> rate gives the transition point between monodisperse and polydisperse emulsion production.

A device that is often used for this step of the process is the bubble column. Bubble columns have good mixing characteristics, resulting in good mass and heat transfer qualities. In spite of their frequent application, fundamental knowledge on the behaviour of bubble columns is still lacking. Their design and operation {{is based on a}} large number of empirical correlations and scale-up continues to be very complicated. In this thesis, a number of mathematical models have been developed, improved and validated which can help obtain more detailed knowledge on the important phenomena prevailing in gas-liquid <b>dispersed</b> <b>flows...</b>|$|R
