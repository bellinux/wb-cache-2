5|$|Aquinas {{supported}} Augustine's {{view that}} evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The {{existence of this}} evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> without free will, {{he argued that the}} possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault {{on the part of the}} agent. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.|$|E
25|$|A craft unionist {{might argue}} the miners would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> {{sticking}} {{to their own}} business. After all, both the miner's union and the fledgling mill worker's unions had been destroyed. But Haywood took away from this experience the conviction that labor needed more, not less, industrial unionism. The miners had struck in sympathy with the smeltermen, but other unions—notably, craft unions—had not.|$|E
25|$|Domitius was Consul in 32 and {{appointed}} by Tiberius as a commissioner in early 37. His son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, later Emperor Nero, {{was born on}} 15 December 37 in Antium. According to Suetonius, when Domitius was congratulated by his friends {{for the birth of}} his son he replied that any child born to him and Agrippina would have a detestable nature and become a public danger, a fact that became true during the second part of Nero's reign. When Nero castrated a boy named Sporus and married him as a wife, Suetonius quoted one Roman who lived around this time who remarked that the world would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> if Nero's father had married someone more like the castrated boy.|$|E
5000|$|Adlai Atkins: The {{only other}} success {{to come from}} Leela's orphanage, Adlai was a remarkably average man who had become a {{cosmetic}} surgeon. He grafted a second eye onto Leela's face- which gave her a normal appearance although she still could not actually see through the other eye- and the two began dating, but when Adlai commented that an orphan with a third ear on her forehead could be given an operation to be 'acceptable', Leela realized that she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> as she <b>was</b> and made Adlai undo the surgery.|$|R
25|$|When liberal Guadalupe Victoria {{became the}} first {{president}} of Mexico in 1824, conservatists relied on their belief that the state <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> before the new government came into power, so, by comparison, the old government <b>was</b> <b>better</b> {{in the eyes of the}} Conservatives. Following this sentiment, the conservatives pushed to take control of the government, and they succeeded. General Santa Anna was elected president in 1833. The following decade, the Mexican–American War (1846–48) caused Mexico to lose a significant amount of territory to the United States. This loss led to a rebellion by the enraged liberal forces against the conservative government.|$|R
5000|$|He also {{suggests}} that it would <b>be</b> <b>better</b> for the bourgeoisie not to wield power directly because this would make their dominance too obvious, creating a clear target for proletarian attack. Better to make the workers fight a [...] "two front war" [...] (Elster) against the aristocracy in government and the bourgeoisie in the economy. This would, among other things, {{make it difficult for}} the proletarians to form a clear conception of who was their principal enemy. Regarding France, he suggests that the bourgeoisie recognised that they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> under the monarchy (1830-1848) than during the brief period when they wielded power themselves (1848-1851) [...] "since they must now confront the subjugated classes and contend against them without mediation, without the concealment afforded by the crown." ...|$|R
25|$|An early {{milestone}} {{in the rise}} in importance of blogs came in 2002, when many bloggers focused on comments by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. Senator Lott, at a party honoring U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond, praised Senator Thurmond by suggesting that the United States would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> had Thurmond been elected president. Lott's critics saw these comments as a tacit approval of racial segregation, a policy advocated by Thurmond's 1948 presidential campaign. This view was reinforced by documents and recorded interviews dug up by bloggers. (See Josh Marshall's Talking Points Memo.) Though Lott's comments were made at a public event attended by the media, no major media organizations reported on his controversial comments until after blogs broke the story. Blogging helped to create a political crisis that forced Lott to step down as majority leader.|$|E
25|$|Pope Callixtus III took King Thomas very seriously: {{he ordered}} that the King of Bosnia be handed the Crusaders' cross, the papal flag and the crusading fund, marking {{him as the}} leader of the {{coalition}} in July 1457. Thomas relied not on his own dubious strength, however, but on assistance of Western rulers. His emissaries to King Alfonso V of Aragon, Doge Francesco Foscari of Venice, Duke Francesco I Sforza of Milan, and Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy all reported refusals of help. Cardinal Carvajal was sent to Bosnia to meet with King Thomas. Cardinal Giovanni Castiglione skeptically wrote that Carvajal would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> if he had stayed in Buda. Indeed, Carvajal found Thomas ill-equipped to deal with the enemy. The Pope became disillusioned with him, and the leadership of the Christian coalition was transferred to the Albanian lord Skanderbeg.|$|E
25|$|Shares in Eurotunnel {{were issued}} at £3.50 per share on 9 December 1987. By mid-1989 the price {{had risen to}} £11.00. Delays and cost overruns led to the price dropping; during {{demonstration}} runs in October 1994 it reached an all-time low. Eurotunnel suspended payment on its debt in September 1995 to avoid bankruptcy. In December 1997 the British and French governments extended Eurotunnel's operating concession by 34years, to 2086. Financial restructuring of Eurotunnel occurred in mid-1998, reducing debt and financial charges. Despite the restructuring, The Economist reported in 1998 that to break even Eurotunnel would have to increase fares, traffic and market share for sustainability. A cost benefit analysis of the tunnel indicated that there were few impacts on the wider economy and few developments associated with the project, and that the British economy would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> {{if it had not}} been constructed.|$|E

25|$|Venables {{was signed}} by Tottenham Hotspur for a fee of £80,000, and made his debut for the club in a North London derby defeat to Arsenal on 9 May 1966. His bad start to life at White Hart Lane {{continued}} when he punched club legend Dave Mackay during training, though no long-term rift developed because of the incident. Spurs went on {{to have a good}} 1966–67 season though, finishing third in the league and beating Millwall (after a replay), Portsmouth, Bristol City, Birmingham City (after a replay) and Nottingham Forest to reach the 1967 FA Cup Final to face his former club Chelsea at Wembley Stadium. Spurs won the cup with a 2–1 victory, Jimmy Robertson and Frank Saul providing the goals before Bobby Tambling scored a late consolation goal for Chelsea. Ironically, earlier in the season Venables had bet £25 on Chelsea to win the cup at odds of 25/1, which would have paid out £500 if Spurs had lost the game, exactly the same figure as the £500 cup bonus he would receive for winning the match; in fact after tax deductions, Venables would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> financially if Chelsea had won.|$|E

500|$|Skullgirls {{received}} {{its share of}} criticism. IGN's Ryan Clements criticized the small selection of gameplay modes, missing character move lists, and overly aggressive AI. GameTrailers criticized the limited roster size, stating that the tag-based battling felt underdeveloped as a result. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer pointed out the lack of online features, such as a spectator mode, replays, and endless lobbies. Jordan Mallory of Joystiq reprimanded the game for its [...] "goofy and immature" [...] premise, sexualized art style, and unoriginal character movesets. Mallory concluded that the series would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> spending another year in development.|$|E
5000|$|Allmusic's Jon O'Brien did a mixed review, also {{criticizing the}} auto-tuned {{production}} and the vocal performances of [...] "The Wedding Band" [...] musicians. He ends: [...] "Newton-John would <b>have</b> perhaps <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> saving the best songs for a new studio album rather than frittering them away on a mixed bag of a soundtrack which makes the fatal mistake of being more fun to record than to listen to".|$|R
50|$|In 1972, the Ugandan Asians were {{expelled}} from Uganda by its president, Idi Amin, with the British government offering these refugees sanctuary in the UK. The NF capitalised on this issues, campaigning against these new arrivals. As well as opposing this {{new wave of}} immigration and exploiting the hostility toward Prime Minister Edward Heath that it had generated, they also used this issue to argue that black Africans were unfit to govern themselves and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> under European colonial rule. The NF engaged {{in a number of}} rallies and street marches focused on protesting the arrival of the Ugandan Asians. The controversy surrounding the issue and the publicity generated by the NF resulted in a rapid growth of the party's membership. Among those who joined were a number of Monday Club members who brought with them much political experience. Tyndall used the opportunity to launch an appeal for greater funds, with the intent on employing full-time regional organisers.|$|R

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido watched [...] "Shades of Gray" [...] for Tor.com, and {{admitted}} that he hadn't seen the episode since the original broadcast. He said that it was a [...] "trainwreck" [...] and even worse than he remembered, because other shows such as [...] and Stargate SG-1 had since done much better clip shows. DeCandido summed it up by saying that [...] "In all honesty, they’d <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> doing one fewer episode — the season was shortened by the writers strike anyhow — and upping the budget on one of the other 21. Just an awful, awful episode." [...] He gave the episode a score of zero out of ten. Zack Handlen reviewed the episode for The A.V. Club, describing the script as [...] "god-awful" [...] and the episode as [...] "forced".|$|E

As he departs Detroit on a bus, he angrily remarks to Homer that he would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> if he never met him and that as far as he is concerned, he has no brother. While Marge tries to console Homer, Lisa agrees with Herb and laments on his life before he discovered he was a [...] "Simpson". Grampa soon arrives and asks about Herb. Before Homer can even answer what happened, Grampa remarks to Homer that he knew [...] "he'd blow it", and leaves in the cab he just arrived in, rather than getting in the car {{with the rest of the}} Simpson family.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opened to}} mixed feedback, and aired {{back-to-back}} with [...] "Good Mourning", as a two-hour season premiere special. Alan Sepinwall of NJ.com {{commented on the}} two episodes being conjoined into one week: [...] "I keep {{going back and forth}} on whether {{it was a good idea}} to do that, or if we'd <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> spacing out the tearful speeches over two weeks. That isn't to say that there shouldn't have been tears, or speeches. George's death, no matter how marginal he had become last season, is and should be a huge event in the lives of these characters. Had the show raced through Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's famous five stages of grief, it would have rang false, as if everyone making the show was in a hurry to move past the events of the wildly uneven fifth season. My problem is, when you put two episodes back-to-back, those rhythms - the pace at which the acts build to emotional crescendos and then briefly recede - start to become too predictable, and it sucks some of the life and emotion away." [...] Sepinwall also praised Wilson's, Ramirez's, and Chamber's performances.|$|E

Eremenko was {{positive}} towards the album's [...] "meticulously arranged music, and multiple stylistic layers {{ensure that the}} record does not wear thin {{after the first few}} listens". However, he furthered stated, [...] "but although Rock'n'Roll Circus is a testament to veritable professional skills of Hamasaki and her producers and songwriters, its emotional power is questionable, to put it mildly." [...] Although criticizing the album's addition of J-pop music, its additional [...] "clichés", and labelling the ballads as the [...] "worst offenders on the album", he concluded, [...] "This is Hamasaki's eleventh album, and so song writing routine is to be expected, to a degree, but she would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> going all the way with the alt-rock gimmick instead of meekly complying with the already trite conventions of J-pop, even if she had created those herself." [...] Tetsuo Hiraga from Hot Express was mixed in his review. Although he commended Hamasaki's transition to rock music and her song writing, he said he became [...] "worried" [...] about the production and found it regressive in comparison to Next Level.|$|E

Is it about her doomed relationship with Guy Ritchie? Who knows? Who cares?". Matthew Parpetua from Pitchfork Media criticized Solveig's [...] "unimaginative arrangements". Sian Rowe from NME found the track to be [...] "flat", this view was also shared by Alex Macpherson from Fact magazine. Robert Leedham from Drowned in Sound website called the song [...] "mediocre", describing it as [...] "synth-flavoured filler of the garden variety". Jon Pareles from The New York Times called it shallow, effective club fodder, describing it as containing [...] "blippy stereo-hopping synthesizers and generic title". This was shared by Emily Mackay of The Quietus, feeling that the song would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> for other artist and was below Madonna's level.|$|E

A writer from the Leader-Post praised Lee's [...] "stunning notes" [...] on [...] "Lithium" [...] which he further described as the equivalent of [...] "My Immortal" [...] from the band's debut studio album Fallen (2003). Saying that it [...] "could blow a hole in the wall", a writer from Billboard went on to describe the song as [...] "the kind of number Evanescence was born to perform: cinematic production, gripping orchestration and Amy Lee's voice gliding through verses and soaring over choruses". The writer finished off his review by noting that Lee's [...] "latest musical affair with darkness is captivating" [...] and it would almost make listeners [...] "wish [...] heart was broken". A more mixed review came from R.J. Carter of the music website The Trades, who felt that [...] "Lithium" [...] was one of The Open Doors two songs which would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>better</b> <b>off</b> as bonus tracks, adding [...] " [...] stretches Lee's glass-shattering capabilities to a level which, at one point, I'm sure deafened the German Shepherd down the street".|$|E
