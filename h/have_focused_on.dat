5|$|Extensive sociological, sexological {{and medical}} debate <b>have</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> the clitoris, {{primarily}} concerning anatomical accuracy, orgasmic factors and their physiological {{explanation for the}} G-spot, and whether the clitoris is vestigial, an adaptation, or serves a reproductive function. Social perceptions of the clitoris range from the significance of its role in female sexual pleasure, assumptions about its true size and depth, and varying beliefs regarding genital modification such as clitoris enlargement, clitoris piercing and clitoridectomy. Genital modification may be for aesthetic, medical or cultural reasons.|$|E

The fact that the crests vary so much rules out most practical functions other than for use in mating displays. Therefore, display was probably the main function of the crest, and any other functions were secondary.|$|E
