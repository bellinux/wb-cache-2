40|$|A mobile lidar (light {{detection}} and ranging) system for environmental monitoring is described. The optical and <b>electronic</b> <b>systems</b> are <b>housed</b> {{in a truck}} with a retractable rooftop transmission and receiving mirror, connected to a 40 -cm-diameter vertically looking telescope. Two injection-seeded Nd:YAG lasers are employed in connection with an optical parametric oscillator-optical parametric amplification transmitter, allowing deep-UV to mid-IR wavelengths to be generated. Fast switching that employs piezoelectric drivers allows multiwavelength differential absorption lidar for simultaneous measurements of several spectrally overlapping atmospheric species. The system {{can also be used}} in an imaging multispectral laser-induced fluorescence mode on solid targets. Advanced LabVIEW computer control and multivariate data processing render the system versatile for a multitude of measuring tasks. We illustrate the monitoring of industrial atmospheric mercury and hydrocarbon emissions, volcanic sulfur dioxide plume mapping, fluorescence lidar probing of seawater, and multispectral fluorescence imaging of the facades of a historical monument.

Indian modifications included fitting pylons to the fuselage side to carry the Sea Eagle anti-ship missile. The Il-38s of the Indian Navy have been sent back to Russia for upgrades. They will incorporate the new Sea Dragon avionic suite, incorporating a new radar, a Forward looking infrared (FLIR) turret under the nose and an <b>electronic</b> intelligence (ELINT) <b>system</b> <b>housed</b> in a box-like structure mounted on struts above the forward fuselage. Three upgraded aircraft, designated Il-38 SD, have been delivered to the Indian Navy. There are reports of efforts towards adding the capability to fire the Indo-Russian Brahmos cruise missile from this aircraft. Mockups have been displayed with air-launched Brahmos attached to underwing pylons on the Indian Navy aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|The {{introduction}} {{of technology and}} <b>electronic</b> <b>systems</b> within the <b>house</b> has questioned the impressions of privacy {{as well as the}} segregation of work from home. Technological advances of surveillance and communications allow insight of personal habits and private lives. As a result, the [...] "private becomes ever more public, and the desire for a protective home life increases, fuelled by the very media that undermine it" [...] writes Hill. Work also, has been altered due to the increase of communications. The [...] "deluge of information", has expressed the efforts of work, conveniently gaining access inside the house. Although commuting is reduced, [...] "the desire to separate working and living remains apparent." [...] In Jonathan Hill's book Immature Architecture, he identifies this new invasion of privacy as Electromagnetic Weather. Natural or man-made weather remains concurrent inside or outside the house, yet the electromagnetic weather is able to generate within both positions. On the other hand, some architects have designed homes in which eating, working and living are brought together.|$|R

40|$|The <b>electronic</b> <b>systems</b> we find {{in almost}} every product today are {{implemented}} using integrated circuits (ICs) mounted on printed circuit boards (PCBs). Developing <b>electronic</b> <b>systems</b> is a challenging task due to complexity and miniaturization. A single IC can contain billions of transistors, which are smaller than ever. As a result more Design-for-Test (DfT) features, so called instruments, are embedded on-chip in modern ICs to handle and monitor various activities. Many defects are handled at IC manufacturing; however, there are many problems occurring after ICs are being mounted on PCBs. In many cases, it is unfortunately not possible to reproduce the problem when the <b>electronic</b> <b>system</b> is taken to a repair shop. These problems are known as No Trouble Found (NTF).
