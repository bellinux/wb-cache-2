5|$|Chris Boucher's five Star Cops scripts {{have been}} semi-professionally {{published}} {{in two volumes}} by Judith Proctor. The first volume An <b>Instinct</b> <b>for</b> Murder was adapted from the first Star Cops episode of the same name. The second volume Little Green Men and Other Stories included the four remaining Boucher scripts. There are some changes from the broadcast episodes – neither the characters of Alexander Krivenko nor Anna Shoun appear in these books. Krivenko {{is replaced by a}} Chinese character, Jiang Li Ho, as an attempt to update the Star Cops universe to reflect the ending of the Cold War in 1989. Shoun is replaced by an Irish character, Dana Cogill – Boucher didn't own the rights to use the Shoun character who had been created by John Collee.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for the {{expedition}} {{was given to}} Sivert Klevan, an engineer with a good <b>instinct</b> <b>for</b> public relations. The ice was to be procured from the glacier Svartisen, and a glaciologist was brought along to give advice. It {{soon became clear that}} the entire three-ton block could not be brought out in one go. Instead, 200kg blocks were cut out with a chainsaw, carried away on a sled, and flown by helicopter down to the town centre. There they were melted together to make a block of ice weighing 3,050kg. The block was placed in a specially constructed iron container, which was insulated with wood and glass wool. The container was placed on top of a truck that would carry {{it all the way to}} the Equator, accompanied by a van carrying equipment and a sedan with a film crew.|$|E

25|$|Educating Eve: The 'Language Instinct' Debate {{is a book}} by Geoffrey Sampson, {{providing}} {{arguments against}} Noam Chomsky's theory of a human <b>instinct</b> <b>for</b> (first) language acquisition. Sampson explains the original {{title of the book}} as a deliberate allusion to Educating Rita (1980), and uses the plot of that play to illustrate his argument. Sampson's book is a response to Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct specifically and Chomskyan linguistic nativism broadly.|$|E
25|$|Eco{{feminism}} is a {{term that}} links feminism with ecology. Its advocates say that paternalistic/capitalistic society {{has led to a}} harmful split between nature and culture. Early ecofeminists propagated that the split can only be healed by the feminine <b>instinct</b> <b>for</b> nurture and holistic knowledge of nature's processes. Modern ecofeminism, or feminist eco-criticism, eschews such essentialism and instead focuses more on intersectional questions, such as how the nature-culture split enables the oppression of female and nonhuman bodies. It is also an activist and academic movement that sees critical connections between the exploitation of nature and the domination over women both caused by men.|$|E
25|$|On the outside, Victoria is a {{typically}} fragile lady of her era, frequently screaming {{when faced with}} the creatures the Doctor and his companions encounter in their travels, such as the Cybermen and the Yeti. However, this exterior hides an inner strength that crops up when needed. Victoria may be young, but she has an <b>instinct</b> <b>for</b> when she is being lied to, and her sensibility is a contrast to the recklessness of Jamie and the curiosity of the Doctor. Jamie, in particular, is very protective towards and fond of Victoria, and is heartbroken when she chooses to leave.|$|E
5000|$|The serial's {{official}} website describe Rachel stating: [...] "She has great <b>instincts</b> <b>for</b> people {{and has a}} sharp mind; she’s fiercely independent and has great strength of character." [...] Of Rachel's persona, Mathews states: [...] "Rachel is outgoing and fun with a sharp mind and good <b>instincts</b> <b>for</b> people. She has incredible strength and is fiercely independent. She has strong values and definite ideas about right and wrong but {{she is also a}} romantic at heart." [...] Mathews has stated the likeness of herself and Rachel stating: [...] "I wish I was more like my character- she's so together! As far as personality goes, she's really driven, and she's professional. ... Rachel's a really bad cook, and I'm a good cook." ...|$|R

25|$|After {{working at}} Norman J. Lewis, Friedman began {{considering}} his own concepts for toy products. In 1970, he formed LJN Toys Ltd., which created toy lines {{and video games}} based on movies, television shows and celebrities. The company was established with the financial backing of Friedman's employer, Norman J. Lewis, who later sold {{his interest in the}} company to a Chinese investor. After Lewis moved on, Friedman remained committed to promoting the company's growth and focused the company's strategy toward licensing. Basing toys on popular characters wasn't a new concept, but Friedman had an <b>instinct</b> <b>for</b> recognizing blockbusters, could conceive products for diverse audiences, and could negotiate and execute licenses quickly, which brought the practice to a new level. LJN found initial success making merchandise from the film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. Friedman continued to acquire licenses, personally meeting with celebrities such as Michael Jackson and Brooke Shields, before making dolls based on their figure.|$|E
25|$|Stravinsky proved {{adept at}} playing {{the part of}} a 'man of the world', {{acquiring}} a keen <b>instinct</b> <b>for</b> business matters and appearing relaxed and comfortable in public. His successful career as a pianist and conductor took him to many of the world's major cities, including Paris, Venice, Berlin, London, Amsterdam and New York and he was known for his polite, courteous and helpful manner. Stravinsky was reputed to have been a philanderer and was rumoured to have had affairs with high-profile partners, such as Coco Chanel. He never referred to it himself, but Chanel spoke about the alleged affair at length to her biographer Paul Morand in 1946; the conversation was published thirty years later. The accuracy of Chanel's claims has been disputed by both Stravinsky's widow, Vera, and by Craft. Chanel's fashion house avers {{there is no evidence that}} any affair between Chanel and Stravinsky ever occurred. A fictionalization of the supposed affair formed the basis of the novel Coco and Igor (2002) and a film, Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky (2009). Despite these alleged liaisons, Stravinsky was considered a family man and devoted to his children.|$|E
25|$|The Buccaneers took {{an early}} lead on Mike Washington's 29-yard {{interception}} {{return for a}} touchdown, after which he left {{the game with a}} pulled stomach muscle. Ricky Bell chipped a shoulder bone on his only play of the game. A Gary Fencik interception set up a Matt Suhey touchdown run that evened the score at 7–7. The Buccaneers' special teams broke down for the second week in a row. Jeff Fisher's 88-yard punt return touchdown broke the record for the longest punt return by a Tampa Bay opponent, a record that had been set by J. T. Smith just the previous week. A long Theo Bell punt return was called back for a penalty. The Buccaneers scored again on the first drive of the second half, which ended in a Kevin House touchdown reception. However, the Bears were able to dominate possession of the football {{for the rest of the}} game, with Walter Payton moving into fourth-place all-time in NFL rushing yardage. Despite a game plan that Jimmie Giles described as the best he'd seen against the Bears, the Buccaneers found themselves prone to errors at critical moments. They outperformed the Bears in most major offensive categories, compiling 450 yards of offense. Several players blamed mental errors and the lack of a killer <b>instinct</b> <b>for</b> the failure to put away what they felt to be an inferior team, while others noted that the large number of injuries left the team without enough personnel to do the things they wanted to. The game left all NFC Central teams tied at 1–2.|$|E

The agent shook his head despondently.|$|R

50|$|Sexual rituals {{fall into}} two categories: culture-created, and natural behaviour, the human animal having {{developed}} sex rituals from evolutionary <b>instincts</b> <b>for</b> reproduction, which are then integrated into society, and elaborated to include aspects such as marriage rites, dances, etc. Arguably indeed, 'sex in its more ritualized and symbolic varieties...has moulded the shape of civilization'.|$|R
500|$|The {{complete}} series {{was released on}} DVD by Network Video in a single, three-disc volume in 2004.

500|$|Spring's {{second in}} command is Chief Superintendent David Theroux, an American. Theroux, an engineer, started out in the US space program but quit and joined the European space effort instead. When he is {{introduced}} in the opening episode, [...] "An <b>Instinct</b> <b>for</b> Murder", he is working as a traffic controller and part-time Star Cop on the European space station Charles de Gaulle. Movie buff Theroux generally tries to maintain an air of wise-cracking, cool detachment which breaks down only when he is forced in [...] "This Case to be Opened in a Million Years" [...] to face his morbid fear of radioactivity.|$|E
500|$|Given {{that the}} series was set in the {{relatively}} near future, Gridneff took great pains {{to ensure that the}} space scenes were depicted as accurately as possible, seeking advice from NASA and other space agencies as well as arranging a set visit by astronaut Pete Conrad, the third man to set foot on the Moon. Conrad's input proved useful in making the scenes set in weightlessness as convincing as the budget would allow. Assistance was also received from an aerospace manufacturer, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, who provided stock footage of astronauts training in a water tank and received an on-screen credit on the first episode [...] "An <b>Instinct</b> <b>for</b> Murder".|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Richard S.

500|$|Russell {{was ignored}} by college recruiters {{and did not}} receive a single letter of {{interest}} until recruiter Hal DeJulio from the University of San Francisco (USF) watched him {{in a high school}} game. DeJulio was not impressed by Russell's meager scoring and [...] "atrocious fundamentals", but sensed that the young center had an extraordinary <b>instinct</b> <b>for</b> the game, especially in the clutch. When DeJulio offered Russell a scholarship, the latter eagerly accepted. Sports journalist John Taylor described it as a watershed in Russell's life, because Russell realized that basketball was his one chance to escape poverty and racism; as a consequence, Russell swore {{to make the best of}} it.|$|E
500|$|Social Darwinism and {{the concept}} of [...] "human nature" [...] are ideas that are {{prevalent}} throughout The Satanic Bible. LaVey describes Satanism as [...] "a religion based on the universal traits of man," [...] and humans are described throughout as inherently carnal and animalistic. Each of the seven deadly sins is described as part of human's natural instinct, and are thus advocated. Social Darwinism is particularly noticeable in The Book of Satan, where LaVey plagiarizes portions of Redbeard's Might Is Right, though it also appears throughout in references to man's inherent strength and <b>instinct</b> <b>for</b> self-preservation. LaVeyan Satanism has been described as [...] "institutionalism of Machiavellian self-interest" [...] because of many of these themes.|$|E

500|$|A {{very small}} amount of {{merchandising}} has been produced for Star Cops. To coincide with the broadcast of the series in 1987, BBC Enterprises released Justin Hayward's theme song [...] "It Won't Be Easy" [...] as a 7-inch and 12-inch single. The 7-inch included the track [...] "Outer Space" [...] by Hayward and Tony Visconti, {{which was one of}} the incidental music tracks written for [...] "An <b>Instinct</b> <b>for</b> Murder", on the B-side. The 12-inch had an extended version of [...] "It Won't Be Easy" [...] on the A-Side and the 7-inch version of [...] "It Won't Be Easy" [...] and [...] "Outer Space" [...] on the B-Side. [...] "It Won't Be Easy" [...] was later released on compact disc as part of the compilation The Best of BBC TV's Themes.|$|E
500|$|Christensen {{believed}} that the present power structure of society was going to collapse, and that racial-oriented Odinists should be prepared for this. She {{believed that}} revolutionary activity to overthrow oppressive governments was a natural <b>instinct</b> <b>for</b> Aryans, as was reflected [...] "from Jefferson to Hitler." [...] Although she approved of its attitude to race, she {{believed that the}} example of Nazi Germany was not one that should be emulated because of its totalitarian structure and alliance with capitalists. Instead she expressed favorable comments regarding the economically left-wing policies of the early Benito Mussolini government in Italy, and of the Strasserite National Bolshevik factions within Germany's Nazi Party. She expressed the view that Hitler's regime did not reach its [...] "true potential" [...] and that instead it should have retained its [...] "original, socialist and folkish agenda".|$|E
500|$|Since 2013, she {{has been}} touring {{intermittently}} with her cabaret act, An Evening with Bernadette Peters, and a concert series, [...] "Bernadette Peters in Concert". In April 2014 she gave concert performances in Australia. The reviewer for The Sydney Morning Herald wrote: [...] "Perhaps {{it is a matter}} of personality as much as voice: a natural warmth and an <b>instinct</b> <b>for</b> never exaggerating the emotional content of a song. Whatever the case, it is easy to see and hear why, for 30 years, Bernadette Peters has probably been musical theatre's finest performer. ... She even breathed new life into 'Send In the Clowns'. ... Rather than make it emotionally swollen (as so many do), Peters contracted it, delicately squeezing out its essence like toothpaste from a near-empty tube." [...] She gave concerts in June 2016 in the UK at the Royal Festival Hall, Manchester Opera House and Edinburgh Playhouse.|$|E
5000|$|Music critic Jason Anderson, {{writing for}} Allmusic, wrote the album [...] "On an album that is mostly {{instrumental}} and generally concerned more with melody than thematic cohesion and quirky technical breakthroughs, Hedges relies on his past offerings and simplest musical <b>instincts</b> <b>for</b> inspiration, {{and the results}} are splendid... this offering is consistent in its quality, and rare in its musical commitment." ...|$|R
