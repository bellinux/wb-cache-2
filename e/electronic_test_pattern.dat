40|$|The {{widespread}} use of Cathode Ray Tubes (CTRs) as soft-copy proofing devices in electronic imaging situations has raised serious questions as to their relevance, the appropriate viewing conditions and the necessary design, color and tone characteristics of the color monitors. Proofs are used at many different stages in the print production process. Each stage has different requirements in terms of color acceptance, detail, sharpness, composition and portability. At each level of the approval cycle various measuring devices are used to qualify acceptability. This thesis deals with every-day use and problems of soft-copy proofing. An <b>electronic</b> <b>test</b> <b>pattern</b> was displayed on a color monitor while the same test pattern in hard-copy proof form was displayed under industry standard 5000 degree Kelvin lighting. Fifty printing industry users of these proofing methods, comprising art directors, buyers, quality assurance representatives and electronic pagination users, evaluated the two proofs using the most common method of measurement visual assessment and completed a written questionnaire. This survey covered color and hue variations, detail, sharpness, design, size and portability descrepancies as they related to a soft-copy proof used as a design comprehensive, initial color approval, intermediate proof and/or the final proof. In general, the fifty industry decision makers found the soft copy proof to be acceptable for all the variables listed above when used as design comp, initial color and /or intermediate proof but rejected it in all cases when used as the final proof. The {{results of this study}} will enable monitor manufacturers, electronic pagination suppliers and users to better understand how soft-copy and hard-copy proofing differ, what the weaknesses are of each, and which areas are most objectionable. By having industry experts weigh the key differences and similarities between the new and the old proofing methods and by judging the shortcomings and the constraints of each, the soft-copy manufacturers will be able to better rank priorities in improving this developing science, and thus better {{meet the needs of the}} people they are serving...|$|E
40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} proposes a defect {{analysis}} system, which automatically aligns a digitized copy of a printed output to a reference electronic original and highlights image defects. We focus on a class of image defects or artifacts caused by shortfalls in the mechanical or electro-photographic processes that include spots, deletions and debris missing deletions. The algorithm begins with image registration performed using a logpolar transformation and mutual information techniques. A confidence map is then calculated by comparing the contrast and entropy {{in the neighborhood of}} each pixel in both the printed document and corresponding electronic original. This results in a qualitative difference map of the two images highlighting the detected defects. The algorithm was demonstrated successfully on a collection of 99 printed images based on 11 original <b>electronic</b> images and <b>test</b> <b>patterns</b> printed on 9 different faulty printers provided by Xerox Corporation.

40|$|Abstract — For a {{significant}} number of electronic systems used in safety-critical applications circuit testing is performed periodically. For these systems, power dissipation due to Built-In Self Test (BIST) can represent {{a significant}} percentage of the overall power dissipation. One possible solution to address this problem consists of <b>test</b> <b>pattern</b> reordering with the purpose of reducing the amount of power dissipated during circuit testing. By reordering <b>test</b> <b>patterns</b> one is able to find test sequences for which power dissipation is minimized. Moreover, a key observation is that <b>test</b> <b>patterns</b> are in general expected to exhibit don’t cares, which can naturally be exploited during <b>test</b> <b>pattern</b> reordering. In this paper we describe efficient algorithms for <b>test</b> <b>pattern</b> reordering in the presence of don’t cares.

This enables a learning effect that may bias the results over time. To address this problem we have developed a variable pattern for the quality assurance of monitors (MoniQA) that allows an evaluation of contrast visibility, geometric distortion, resolution, global image quality including uniformity, and artifacts. The <b>test</b> <b>pattern</b> includes randomly generated elements intended to prevent the observer from learning the test. Examples are random characters {{that have to be}} discriminated from the background to evaluate the threshold luminance difference and variable positions of different features in the <b>test</b> <b>pattern.</b> The newly proposed <b>test</b> <b>patterns</b> were generated and visualized on different viewing stations with a software tool developed in JAVA.
