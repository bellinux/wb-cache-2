30|$|The {{advantage}} of probabilistic over deterministic simulations is clear when both are compared, since the former always overlap the fire front location at each time step, providing {{information regarding the}} probability of the fire to reach a certain location within a designated time. After the very fast spread towards south (until day 20 at 2  h), the fire spread towards the eastern and western boundaries of the fire perimeter (Fig.  5 a, see the MODIS Aqua—VIIRS active <b>fires</b> <b>day</b> 20 at 2  h; and Fig.  5 b, see the MODIS Terra and MODIS Aqua—VIIRS actives <b>fires</b> <b>day</b> 20 at 11, 13 and 22  h). The fire growth towards the west flank was underestimated by the deterministic simulations on day 20 at 2  h onward (Fig.  7, simulations 10 and 11) and did not reached this flank, while probabilistic predictions show probabilities equal or higher to 60  % of the fire reaching that flank, indicating a likely or probable occurrence (Cruz 2010).|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{interpretation}} and communication of fire danger warning levels based on fire weather index values {{are critical for}} fire management activities. A number of different indices {{have been developed for}} various environ-mental conditions, {{and many of them are}} currently applied in operational warning systems. To select an appropriate combination of such indices to work in different ecoregions in mountainous, hilly and flat terrain is challenging. This study analyses the performance of a total of 22 fire weather indices and two raw meteorological variables to predict wildfire occurrence for different ecological regions of Austria with respect to the different characteristics in cli-mate and fire regimes. A median-based linear model was built based on percentile results on <b>fire</b> <b>days</b> and non-fire days to get quantifiable measures of index performance using slope and intercept of an index on <b>fire</b> <b>days.</b> We highlight the finding that one single index is not optimal for all Austrian regions in both summer and winter fire seasons. The summer season (May–November) shows that the Canadian build-up index, the Keetch Byram Drought Index and the mean daily temperature have the best perfor-mance; in the winter season (December–April), the M 68 dwd is the best performing index. It is shown that the index performance on <b>fire</b> <b>days</b> where larger <b>fires</b> appeared is better and that the uncertainties related to the location of the meteorological station can influence the overall results. A proposal for the selection of the best performing fire weather indices for each Austrian ecoregion is made. ...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{analyzed}} fire regime, climatic trend and relationships between fire and climate in the Asağı Köprüçay basin (Antalya, Turkey), {{an area of}} about 205, 000 hectares. The study area is intensively affected by forest fires. Since the historical data on fires were consistent in detail after 1979, {{we analyzed}} the historical period 1979 - 2009. Regarding the climate analysis, data of four meteorological stations representing the different climatic conditions {{of the study area}} were taken into consideration. Daily records of maximum, mean and minimum temperatures, precipitation, wind speed and direction, relative humidity were used for the analysis. In the study period, mean and minimum temperatures showed a statistically significant increasing trend with time. The trends of fire number, burned area and meteorological data were analyzed by using correlation and linear regression techniques. Regarding the historical trends in terms of fire number, no statistically significant trends were observed, because of the high inter-annual variability of the data. The burnt areas showed a general increasing trend that is not statistically significant. No statistically significant correlation between fire number and burnt area was observed. The relationships between weather parameters and the main indicators of <b>fire</b> activity: <b>fire</b> <b>days</b> (FD, at least 1 <b>fire</b> per <b>day),</b> large <b>fire</b> <b>days</b> (LFD, at least 20 hectares per <b>day),</b> multiple <b>fire</b> <b>days</b> (MFD, more than 1 <b>fire</b> per <b>day),</b> were investigated by the application of the logistic regression. The historical relationship between weather variables and the main indicators of the fire activity (FD, LFD, MFD) were analyzed by a set of logistic regression models. In particular, 4 models provided the best combined response in predicting the different fire activity indices on both annual and seasonal data. The different models were characterised by low estimation accuracies for FD, while the best results were obtained for LFD. Temperature and relative humidity are the weather variables mostly correlated with the fire activity probability as predicted by the logistic models. An increase in the accuracy was generally obtained where the 3 and 7 days minimum and maximum average values were used instead of the daily mean values of the weather variables...|$|R
