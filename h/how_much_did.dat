Executive producer Tara Butters compared the relationship to that of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully in the early seasons of The X-Files, where [...] "you really believed they cared about each other but it wasn’t sexual. That was very refreshing." [...] Fazekas discussed giving Jarvis a major character arc in the second season, saying that he [...] "really got a taste for adventure with Peggy in the first season, so, when she comes back into his life, he's so happy because he's so bored with being Howard Stark's butler ... what that starts is a really interesting story for him, which is, <b>how</b> <b>much</b> <b>did</b> he really understand about what Peggy does? For him, it's like a fun diversion, even though he's in danger ... we will see in Jarvis' story how he grows to understand that and where he comes out in the end. It will have a cost for him, and it {{will have an impact}} on his relationship with Peggy".|$|E

Its cover had [...] "a graphic {{drawing of the}} {{offending}} flaccid appendage draped over a sesame seed bun with lashings of bloody sauce." [...] Posters with a similar image that advertised the group had them banned at some venues. National youth radio station Triple J criticised the group as being immature {{and told them to}} [...] "grow up". The EP was described as having [...] "good songs but it sounds like it was recorded under a doona" [...] and had the group banned from some radio stations and retail outlets. One of its tracks, [...] "I Wish I Was as Credible as Roger Climpson" [...] (aka [...] "Roger"), attracted attention of its subject, Roger Climpson – a Seven News anchor on TV – who posed with the group for a photo. The E.P also features fan favourites [...] "Chemotherapy", and a cover of the TV series theme [...] "Home And Away". The E.P featured an alternate cover depicting rabbits on the flipside of the liftout to appease record stores or people who may have been offended by the original artwork. In October of that year, they released a single, [...] "Sorry About the Ruse", on their own label, <b>How</b> <b>Much</b> <b>Did</b> I Fucking Pay For This Records?
