50|$|During the 1950s the New South Wales Government Railways ordered {{rolling stock}} for the Brisbane Limited, {{including}} some stainless steel double deck sleeping carriages. Due to financial constraints only ten conventional sleeping carriages were built. To use the excess materials {{that had been}} stockpiled, Commonwealth Engineering constructed five cars, four self-propelled Budd Rail Diesel Cars., and a matching non-powered trailer car. While following Budd RDC layouts, these cars were smaller than standard, being only 77 feet in length and narrower in width to fit the NSW loading gauge. There is a myth that the builders had to take considerable care during the design phase to ensure the structural integrity of the cars due to the large opening required for the roof mounted radiators. In fact the roof structure is continuous beneath the radiator blister the only openings being for <b>electrical</b> <b>conduits</b> and <b>tubing,</b> these openings being too small to affect structural integrity.|$|R

50|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>conduit</b> {{provides}} {{very good}} protection to enclosed conductors from impact, moisture, and chemical vapors. Varying numbers, sizes, {{and types of}} conductors can be pulled into a conduit, which simplifies design and construction compared to multiple runs of cables or the expense of customized composite cable. Wiring systems in buildings {{may be subject to}} frequent alterations. Frequent wiring changes are made simpler and safer through the use of <b>electrical</b> <b>conduit,</b> as existing conductors can be withdrawn and new conductors installed, with little disruption along the path of the conduit.|$|R

50|$|The fan-forced {{evaporator}} {{unit in the}} display case was not properly secured, and thus was able to vibrate constantly while in operation; these vibrations were carried along the copper refrigant pipes, causing the pipes to rub against the <b>electrical</b> <b>conduit</b> in the wall soffit and make it vibrate too. Through a combination of galvanic corrosion (where the copper refrigerant pipes were in physical contact with the aluminum <b>electrical</b> <b>conduit,</b> causing the conduit to erode over time), and vibration - as well as jagged edges and stretched wires resulting from poor workmanship during the installation - the electrical wires inside the conduit ended up missing chunks of their plastic insulation, and the conduit was rendered un-grounded (there was no separate ground wire; the metal conduit itself was designed to function as the ground, so {{the disintegration of the}} conduit rendered the system un-grounded).|$|R
