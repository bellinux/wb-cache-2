50|$|CPM {{has become}} very {{applicable}} in the workplace as personal mobile devices have increasingly been allowed {{to be brought to}} work. The concept of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) has stirred conversation on the concept of privacy, security and boundaries between employee and employer. Companies have had to take measures to further secure their network or even decide whether they want to have employee access personal accounts (i.e. email) or devices while on the job. By the same token, some employees argue that companies should not be able to track what is being done on their personal devices or even on company computers even if they are in the work place.Even before stepping foot into the workplace, much can be said about CPM and <b>interviewing.</b> <b>How</b> much we decide to reveal within an interview and the boundaries we have in that situation is directly related to CPM. Even interviewing within a job (as a cop, for example) requires a certain sensitivity to people's boundaries and how much private information they are willing to reveal.|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim {{with this}} study was to {{understand}} and by interviews analyse municipalities salutogenic elderly care. Method: The method that was used is qualitative method with semi-structured interviews. I chose the unit managers in elderly care for the seven interviews I conducted. Why I chose them was {{because of the fact that}} these people often are the ones that is the easiest to come in contact with. Also because I thought it would be hard to motivate why I’ve only chosen seven care workers when there are so many more in an organisation. The study was carried out by seven interviews with the managers in elderly care that works in three different municipalities. The theories I chose to analyse my data was a focus in new institutionalism as a translation theoretical perspective and Antonovskys (2005) theory about sense of coherence, SOC. Result and conclusion: Something that was not expected was that the respondents had a somewhat similar interpretation of salutogenes. However, approach and implementation differed between the different municipalities but also between the heads of units in the same municipality. All respondents also pointed of the importance of defining the work salutogenic before implementing it. Suggestions for future research: Observation instead of <b>interviewing,</b> <b>how</b> is the work actually done? Not what the interviewees say they do but how they actually do. Antonovsky (1979) developed a self-assessment questionnaire for SOC, SOC- 29, can that be used in elderly care somehow?KASAM, salutogene...|$|E
