5|$|A {{prototype}} for the <b>Kinetoscope</b> {{was shown to}} a convention of the National Federation of Women's Clubs on May 20, 1891. The first public demonstration of the <b>Kinetoscope</b> {{was held at the}} Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. Instrumental to the birth of American movie culture, the <b>Kinetoscope</b> also had a major impact in Europe; its influence abroad was magnified by Edison's decision not to seek international patents on the device, facilitating numerous imitations of and improvements on the technology. In 1895, Edison introduced the Kinetophone, which joined the <b>Kinetoscope</b> with a cylinder phonograph. Film projection, which Edison initially disdained as financially nonviable, soon superseded the Kinetoscope's individual exhibition model. Many of the projection systems developed by Edison's firm in later years would use the <b>Kinetoscope</b> name.|$|E
5|$|On June 14, a {{match with}} {{abbreviated}} rounds was staged between boxers Michael Leonard and Jack Cushing at the Black Maria. Seven-hundred-and-fifty feet worth of images {{or even more}} were shot {{at the rate of}} 30 fps—easily the longest motion picture to date. In August 1894, the film premiered at the <b>Kinetoscope</b> Exhibition Company's parlor at 83 Nassau Street in New York. A half-dozen expanded <b>Kinetoscope</b> machines each showed a different round of the fight for a dime, meaning sixty cents to see the complete bout. For a planned series of follow-up fights (of which the outcome of at least the first was fixed), the Lathams signed famous heavyweight James J. Corbett, stipulating that his image could not be recorded by any other <b>Kinetoscope</b> company—the first movie star contract.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Kinetoscope</b> is {{an early}} motion picture {{exhibition}} device. The <b>Kinetoscope</b> was designed for films to be viewed by one individual at a time through a peephole viewer window {{at the top of}} the device. The <b>Kinetoscope</b> was not a movie projector, but introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of video, by creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of perforated film bearing sequential images over a light source with a high-speed shutter. A process using roll film first described in a patent application submitted in France and the U.S. by French inventor Louis Le Prince, the concept was also used by U.S. inventor Thomas Edison in 1889, and subsequently developed by his employee William Kennedy Laurie Dickson between 1889 and 1892. Dickson and his team at the Edison lab also devised the Kinetograph, an innovative motion picture camera with rapid intermittent, or stop-and-go, film movement, to photograph movies for in-house experiments and, eventually, commercial <b>Kinetoscope</b> presentations.|$|E
25|$|Buffalo Bill was {{friends with}} Thomas Edison, and Edison built the world's largest {{electrical}} power plant at {{the time for the}} Wild West Show. Buffalo Bill and 15 of his show Indians appeared in two <b>Kinetoscopes</b> filmed September 24, 1894.|$|R

50|$|Thomas Edison {{was slow}} to develop a {{projection}} system at this time, since his company's single-user <b>Kinetoscopes</b> were very profitable. However, films projected for large audiences could generate more profits since fewer machines were needed {{in proportion to the}} number of viewers. Thus, others sought to develop their own projection systems.|$|R
5|$|Twenty-five {{cents for}} {{no more than a few}} minutes of {{entertainment}} was hardly cheap diversion. For the same amount, one could purchase a ticket to a major vaudeville theater; when America's first amusement park opened in Coney Island the following year, a 25-cent entrance fee covered admission to three rides, a performing sea lion show, and a dance hall. The <b>Kinetoscope</b> was an immediate success, however, and by June 1, the Hollands were also operating venues in Chicago and San Francisco. Entrepreneurs (including Raff and Gammon, with their own International Novelty Co.) were soon running <b>Kinetoscope</b> parlors and temporary exhibition venues around the United States. New firms joined the <b>Kinetoscope</b> Company in commissioning and marketing the machines. The <b>Kinetoscope</b> exhibition spaces were largely, though not uniformly, profitable. After fifty weeks in operation, the Hollands' New York parlor had generated approximately $1,400 in monthly receipts against an estimated $515 in monthly operating costs; receipts from the Chicago venue (located in a Masonic temple) were substantially lower, about $700 a month, though presumably operating costs were lower as well. For each machine, Edison's business at first generally charged $250 to the <b>Kinetoscope</b> Company and other distributors, which would use them in their own exhibition parlors or resell them to independent exhibitors; individual films were initially priced by Edison at $10. During the Kinetoscope's first eleven months of commercialization, the sale of viewing machines, films, and auxiliary items generated a profit of more than $85,000 for Edison's company.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1896, Edison had {{turned his attention to}} promoting a projector technology, the Phantoscope, developed by young inventors Charles Francis Jenkins and Thomas Armat. The rights to the system had been acquired by Raff and Gammon, who redubbed it the Vitascope and arranged with Edison to present himself as its creator. With Dickson having left his employ, the Kinetophone was soon mothballed and Edison suspended work on sound cinema for an extended period. Departing the Vitascope operation after little more than a year, Edison commissioned the development of his own projection systems, the Projectoscope and then multiple iterations of the Projecting <b>Kinetoscope.</b> In 1912, he introduced the ambitious and expensive Home Projecting <b>Kinetoscope,</b> which employed a unique format of three parallel columns of sequential frames on one strip of film—the middle column ran through the machine in the reverse direction from its neighbors. It was a commercial failure. Four years later, the Edison operation came out with its last substantial new film exhibition technology, a short-lived theatrical system called the Super <b>Kinetoscope.</b> Much of the Edison company's most creative work in the motion picture field from 1897 on involved the use of Kinetoscope-related patents in threatened or actual lawsuits for the purpose of financially pressuring or blocking commercial rivals.|$|E
5|$|Ohio-native Thomas Edison helped {{contribute}} to the modern communications world through many of his inventions, including his stock ticker, <b>Kinetoscope,</b> phonograph, and his contributions to the telegraph. Ohio resident Granville Woods invented the telegraphony, which he sold to the American Bell Telephone Company.|$|E
5000|$|Seances {{grew out}} of Maddin’s Hauntings project. Noah Cowan, a former {{director}} of the Toronto International Film Festival, told Maddin “he didn’t think it was possible to make art on the Internet,” which “reminded Maddin of what people said about cinema when it was starting out, when the moviolas and <b>kinetoscopes</b> were considered artless novelties.” ...|$|R
500|$|Even as Edison {{followed}} {{his dream of}} securing the <b>Kinetoscope's</b> popularity by adding sound to its allure, many in the field were beginning to suspect that film projection was the next step that should be pursued. When Norman Raff communicated his customers' interest in such a system to Edison, the great inventor summarily rejected the notion: ...|$|R
50|$|Acres and Paul's {{next film}} was The Oxford and Cambridge University Boat Race, {{completed}} on 30 March 1895. This and other films were shown on <b>Kinetoscopes</b> that Paul {{set up at}} Imre Kiralfy's Empire of India Exhibition at Earls Court. Films were not projected onto screens for a mass audience, however, until early 1896 when Paul and Acres separately demonstrated projectors after their partnership ended in acrimony the previous year.|$|R
5|$|Under {{continuing}} {{pressure from}} Raff, Edison eventually conceded {{to investigate the}} possibility of developing a projection system. He seconded one of his lab's technicians to the <b>Kinetoscope</b> Company to initiate the work, without informing Dickson. Dickson's ultimate discovery of this move {{appears to have been}} one of the central factors leading to his break with Edison that occurred in spring 1895.|$|E
5|$|Hollywood, a {{northern}} district of Los Angeles, California, {{is one of}} the leaders in motion picture production. The world's first commercial motion picture exhibition was given in New York City in 1894, using Thomas Edison's <b>Kinetoscope.</b> The next year saw the first commercial screening of a projected film, also in New York, and the United States was in the forefront of sound film's development in the following decades. Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, Edison {{introduced}} a new cylinder-based synch-sound apparatus known, just like his 1895 system, as the Kinetophone; instead of films being shown to individual viewers in the <b>Kinetoscope</b> cabinet, they were now projected onto a screen. The phonograph was connected by an intricate arrangement of pulleys to the film projector, allowing—under ideal conditions—for synchronization. However, conditions were rarely ideal, and the new, improved Kinetophone was retired after {{little more than a}} year. By the mid-1910s, the groundswell in commercial sound motion picture exhibition had subsided. Beginning in 1914, The Photo-Drama of Creation, promoting Jehovah's Witnesses' conception of mankind's genesis, was screened around the United States: eight hours worth of projected visuals involving both slides and live action were synchronized with separately recorded lectures and musical performances played back on phonograph.|$|E
50|$|The Boxing Kangaroo is an 1896 British short {{black-and-white}} silent documentary film, {{produced and}} directed by Birt Acres for exhibition on Robert W. Paul's peep show <b>Kinetoscopes,</b> featuring a young boy boxing with a kangaroo. The film was considered lost until footage from an 1896 Fairground Programme, originally shown in a portable booth at Hull Fair by Midlands photographer George Williams, donated to the National Fairground Archive was identified as being from this film.|$|R
50|$|Hugh Jamieson {{was born}} in Kansas in 1889 and {{attended}} Baker University in Baldwin, where he studied engineering. Using a $150 loan, Jamieson bought his first motion picture camera, operated using a hand crank. He financed his education by opening a movie theater and upon graduation, {{got a job at}} Thomas Edison’s company selling <b>Kinetoscopes</b> in the Missouri area. After a fire at Edison in 1914, Hugh decided to set off to produce his own films.|$|R
50|$|Landing at Low Tide is an 1896 British short {{black-and-white}} silent comedy film, {{produced and}} directed by Birt Acres for exhibition on Robert W.

5|$|In {{the spring}} of the {{following}} year, steps began to make coin operation, via a nickel slot, part of {{the mechanics of the}} viewing system. By autumn 1892, the design of the <b>Kinetoscope</b> was essentially complete. The filmstrip, based on stock manufactured first by Eastman, and then, from April 1893 onward, by New York's Blair Camera Co., was 35 mm (1 3/8inches) wide; each vertically sequenced frame bore a rectangular image and four perforations on each side. Within a few years, this basic format would be adopted globally as the standard for motion picture film, which it remains to this day. The publication in the October 1892 Phonogram of cinematographic sequences shot in the format demonstrates that the Kinetograph had already been reconfigured to produce movies with the new film.|$|E
5|$|Many {{events at}} the Queen's Hall were not {{presented}} by Newman. The hall was frequently let to organisations such as the Bach Choir and the Philharmonic Society (from 1903 the Royal Philharmonic Society), and later the London Choral Society and Royal Choral Society. The hall was used {{for a wide range}} of other activities, including balls, military band concerts under Sousa, lectures, public meetings, Morris dancing, Eurythmics and religious services. On 14 January 1896, the UK's first public film show was presented at the Queen's Hall to members and wives of the Royal Photographic Society by the maker of the Kineopticon and Fellow of the society, Birt Acres, and his colleague, Arthur Melbourne-Cooper. This was an improved version of the early <b>Kinetoscope.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{far back}} as the Vitascope days, some exhibitors had {{screened}} films accompanied by phonographs playing appropriate, though very roughly timed, sound effects; {{in the style of the}} Kinetophone described above, rhythmically matching recordings were also made available for march and dance subjects. While Edison oversaw cursory sound-cinema experiments after the success of The Great Train Robbery (1903) and other Edison Manufacturing Company productions, it was not until 1908 that he returned in earnest to the combined audiovisual concept that had first led him to enter the motion picture field. Edison patented a synchronization system connecting a projector and a phonograph, located behind the screen, via an assembly of three rigid shafts—a vertical one descending from each device, joined by a third running horizontally the entire length of the theater, beneath the floor. Two years later, he supervised a press demonstration at the laboratory of a sound-film system of either this or a later design. In 1913, Edison finally introduced the new Kinetophone—like all of his sound-film exhibition systems since the first in the mid-1890s, it used a cylinder phonograph, now connected to a Projecting <b>Kinetoscope</b> via a fishing line–type belt and a series of metal pulleys. While it met with great acclaim in the short term, poorly trained operators had trouble keeping picture in synchronization with sound and, like other sound-film systems of the era, the Kinetophone had not solved the issues of insufficient amplification and unpleasant audio quality. Its drawing power as a novelty soon faded and when a fire at Edison's West Orange complex in December 1914 destroyed all of the company's Kinetophone image and sound masters, the system was abandoned.|$|E

25|$|Officially the <b>kinetoscope</b> entered Europe {{when the}} rich American Businessman Irving T. Bush (1869–1948) bought from the Continental Commerce Company of Frank Z. Maguire and Joseph D. Baucus a dozen {{machines}}. Bush placed from October 17, 1894, the first kinetoscopes in London. At the same time, the French company <b>Kinétoscope</b> Edison Michel et Alexis Werner bought these machines {{for the market}} in France. In {{the last three months}} of 1894, the Continental Commerce Company sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in Europe (i.e. the Netherlands and Italy). In Germany and in Austria-Hungary, the <b>kinetoscope</b> was introduced by the Deutsche-österreichische-Edison-Kinetoscop Gesellschaft, founded by the Ludwig Stollwerck of the Schokoladen-Süsswarenfabrik Stollwerck & Co of Cologne.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Kinetoscope</b> was {{an early}} motion picture {{exhibition}} device. It was designed for films to be viewed individually {{through the window of}} a cabinet housing its components.

First described in conceptual terms by Thomas Alva Edison in 1888, his invention was largely developed by one of his assistants, William Kennedy Laurie Dickson, between 1889 and 1892.|$|E
25|$|The first kinetoscopes {{arrived in}} Belgium at the Fairs in early 1895. The Edison's <b>Kinétoscope</b> Français, a Belgian company, {{was founded in}} Brussels on January 15, 1895, with the rights to sell the kinetoscopes in Monaco, France and the French colonies. The main investors in this company were Belgian industrialists.|$|E
50|$|Electrocuting an Elephant {{does not}} seem to have been as popular as other Edison films, and could not even be viewed at Luna Park because the {{attraction}} did not have the coin-operated <b>kinetoscopes</b> needed to view it. The film and Topsy's story fell into relative obscurity in the intervening years, showing up as an out-of-context clip in the 1979 film Mr. Mike's Mondo Video. In 1991 documentary maker Ric Burns made the film Coney Island which included a segment recounting the death of Topsy, including clips from the film Electrocuting an Elephant.|$|R

The first piece, titled Clash in the Clouds, was released on July 30, 2013. It is a non-story arena-based combat mode where the player is faced with increasingly difficult waves of enemies on various maps based on in-game settings. The player earns in-game money {{that they can use}} at a central hub to buy new vigors, upgrade weapons and vigors, and unlock character models, concept art, <b>kinetoscopes,</b> and music.

A photograph of Acres filming the movie has survived, which shows that the camera used in the production was relatively portable despite what might have been expected from the equipment of the time. The film was long considered lost but footage discovered in the Ray Henville collection in 1995 has been identified by the BFI as being from this film.|$|R
25|$|In 1880, Muybridge first {{projected}} moving {{images on}} a screen when he gave a presentation at the California School of Fine Arts; this was the earliest known motion picture exhibition.

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1895, the tobacco shop Tabacaria Neves presented Edison's <b>Kinetoscope</b> (in fact, a copy of said invention, built in London by Robert William Paul, ordered by the Greek George Georgiades, who presented the machine in Lisbon). Unlike preceding inventions, the Kinestoscope allowed individual viewing and a film made up of 1,380 photographs enabling a 20-second projection of 20 seconds.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} imports were {{cotton and}} woolen textiles like calico and cotton velvet. In 1896, the Kobe resident Takahashi Shinji imported a <b>Kinetoscope</b> through Rynel and Co., which occupied Lot 14, and held Japan's first public showings of moving pictures. From 1894 {{until the end}} of the Meiji period, Kobe hosted the highest level of imports of all Japan's ports.|$|E

It also made <b>kinetoscopes,</b> phonograph cylinder wax, x-ray equipment, medical instruments, and electric fans in its factory in Silver Lake, New Jersey.From April 1895 to June 1908 William E. Gilmore was vice-president and general manager of the company. He was succeeded by the patent lawyer Frank Dyer.|$|R
50|$|Their end-of-the-year {{plans to}} hang Topsy {{at the park}} in a public {{spectacle}} and charge admission were stopped by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The event was cut back to invited guests and press only and Thompson and Dundy agreed to use a more sure method of strangling the elephant with large ropes tied to a steam-powered winch with poison and electrocution planned for good measure. On January 4, 1903, {{in front of a}} small crowd of invited reporters and guests Topsy was fed poison, electrocuted, and strangled, the electrocution ultimately killing her. Amongst the press that day was a crew from the Edison Manufacturing movie company who filmed the event. Their film of the electrocution part was released to be viewed in coin-operated <b>kinetoscopes</b> under the title Electrocuting an Elephant.|$|R
5000|$|Amongst {{the press}} the day Topsy {{was put to}} death was a film crew from the Edison film company, {{possibly}} directed by Edwin S. Porter or Jacob Blair Smith. The film they created {{of the death of}} Topsy was 74 seconds long and shows just the electrocution. It was released {{to be added to the}} lineup of films viewable in Edison <b>kinetoscopes</b> within a few weeks under the title Electrocuting an Elephant. This was one of many short [...] "actuality" [...] films shot by the Edison Manufacturing Company from 1897 onwards at Coney Island depicting rides, bathing scenes, diving horses, and even a film of elephants in 1903 [...] "Shooting the Chutes at Luna Park". The Edison company submitted the film to the Library of Congress as a [...] "paper print" [...] (a photographic record of each frame of the film) for copyright purposes. This form of submission may have saved the film for posterity since most films and negatives of this period decayed or were destroyed over time.|$|R
