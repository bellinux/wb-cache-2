5|$|Amy and Rory {{discover}} that the wounded Doctor had told his earlier self to create a diversion, allowing him to rig the Pandorica to fly into the TARDIS explosion. The Doctor postulates that enough of the original universe still exists in the Pandorica to completely restore it via the exploding TARDIS. After a tearful farewell to Amy, Rory, and River where he instructs Amy to focus on her family and Rory to restore them in the new universe, the Doctor engages the Pandorica and flies it into the exploding TARDIS. A second Big Bang occurs. The Doctor comes to consciousness and begins witnessing events in his life in reverse as {{the cracks in the}} universe close. The Doctor has to stay outside this new universe in order <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> happen. After a final goodbye to Amelia on the night they met, he enters the cracks and disappears.|$|E
5|$|In {{those species}} which {{reproduce}} sexually, haploid cells bud from the spores. Depending {{on the environmental}} conditions, either a myxamoeba or a myxoflagellate buds from the spore. Myxamoebae move like amoebae – that is, crawling on the substrate – and are produced in dry conditions. Myxoflagellates, which are peritrichous and can swim, develop in moist to wet environments. Myxoflagellates almost always have two flagella; one is generally shorter than the other and sometimes only vestigial. The flagella are used for locomotion and to help to move food particles closer. If the humidity changes, cells can switch between the two manifestations. Neither form has a cell wall. This developmental stage (and the next one) serves as a nourishment provider and {{is also known as}} the first trophic phase (nourishment phase). In this monocellular phase, the Myxogastria consume bacteria and fungus spores, and probably dissolved substances, and they reproduce through simple cell division. If the environmental conditions change adversely in this phase, for example extreme temperature, extreme dryness or food shortage, the Myxogastria may switch to very long-lived, thin-shelled quiescent states – the so-called microcysts. <b>For</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> happen, the myxamoebae assume a round shape and secrete a thin cell wall. In this state they can easily survive one year or longer. If living conditions improve, they become active again.|$|E
5|$|Legacy Parkway {{is part of}} {{the larger}} Legacy Highway project first {{proposed}} by then-governor Mike Leavitt, which ultimately will run north from Nephi toward Brigham City. The concept of a western Davis County highway has existed since the 1960s, with some proposals routing the highway over Antelope Island or across Farmington Bay. Legacy Parkway was to extend to {{the west side of the}} Salt Lake City International Airport and connect to I-80 at 5600West; however, that plan was abandoned in October 1997. A survey taken by Valley Research for The Salt Lake Tribune in December 1997 showed 64percent of Davis County residents were in support of building the parkway, with just 19percent opposing the construction. State officials had hoped to have the parkway open in time for the 2002 Winter Olympics being held in Salt Lake City; however, construction was delayed too many times <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> occur.|$|E

5|$|Several {{suggestions}} {{have been}} made {{for the history of}} the Great Stone. There was a succession of plagues in Manchester from the 14th century onwards, and during the Great Plague of 1655–56 the holes {{in the top of the}} stone were filled with vinegar or holy water, through which coins were passed in the belief that would halt the spread of the disease. But the holes are probably too deep <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> have been the stone's original purpose. It may have been a marker on the Roman road between Northwich and Manchester, or some kind of boundary marker. The Great Stone is also thought to have been the base of an Anglo-Saxon cross shaft. A local legend had it that the stone was slowly sinking into the earth, and that its ultimate disappearance would mark the end of the world.|$|E

But <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> cover the phenomena one has already to deal with generalized eigenfunctions (for example, by means of a rigged Hilbert space). On the other hand it is simple to construct a group algebra, the spectrum of which captures the Fourier transform's basic properties, and this is carried out by means of Pontryagin duality.|$|E

500|$|Wetherall kept off {{his injury}} {{problems}} and {{played in the}} first 15 games of the 2003–04 season, but was ruled out for two months after suffering medial ligament damage, following a knee injury sustained during the club's 1–0 defeat to Watford. He returned on 28 December 2003 in a 1–0 victory which gave Bradford their first win in six games. His return to the defence added a second successive clean sheet. The revival in form was short-lived and despite Wetherall missing just one more game, when he sustained a calf injury, Bradford were threatened with another relegation. Wetherall scored a header against Reading in a 2–1 win and gave Bradford a [...] "slim chance" [...] of avoiding relegation, only <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> be confirmed two weeks later after a 3–2 defeat to Wimbledon.|$|E
500|$|As {{the film}} neared completion, the Weinstein {{brothers}} changed the film's title from Scary Movie to Scream. They {{were inspired by}} the Michael Jackson song of the same name. Bob Weinstein considered Scary Movie to be an unsuitable title as, {{in addition to the}} horror and violence, the film contained elements of satire and comedy; Weinstein wished <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> be better conveyed by the title. The change was effected so late into production that congratulatory gifts bore the original name. Williamson and Craven immediately disliked the new title, and considered it [...] "stupid". Both later remarked that the change turned out to be positive, and that Weinstein had been wise to pick the new title. Following a screening of the film in front of a test audience and Miramax executives, Craven was offered a two-picture contract for sequels to Scream.|$|E
500|$|Grey's {{has also}} been {{credited}} to have changed the perception on how good and bad television can be defined, The A.V.

It’s time <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> end. At its best, Grey’s {{has been among the}} very best shows on TV, and at its worst, it’s been at least fascinating to watch. To write it off is to unnecessarily narrow the definition of what good TV can be, to limit what the medium is capable of. TV is at its best when it emotionally connects, and even when it seems to be otherwise merrily hurtling off a cliff, Grey’s Anatomy is nothing but emotional connection, which is more than other, more consistently better shows can say." ...|$|E

500|$|Some {{commentators}} have criticized Ryan's votes {{for what they}} believe were deficit-increasing policies during the George W.

While he voted for the two Bush tax cuts (in 2001 and 2003), he also voted for the 2003 bill that created the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), and the $700 billion bank bailout, and Ryan was one of 32 Republicans in the House {{to vote for the}} auto industry bailout. In 2011 President Barack Obama criticized Ryan as [...] "not [...] on the level" [...] by describing himself as a fiscal conservative while voting for these policies, as well as two [...] "unpaid for" [...] wars. Columnist Ezra Klein wrote in 2012: [...] "If you know about Paul Ryan at all, you probably know him as a deficit hawk.

500|$|Cleave {{spent his}} early {{childhood}} in West Africa, which he credits for having partially inspired The Other Hand. Further inspiration came from Cleaves's temporary employment while studying experimental {{psychology at the}} University of Oxford. During the summer, Cleave painted underpasses, gardened and picked up litter, and hoped to use this experience to write a book. His final job was at Campsfield House in Oxfordshire, an immigration detention centre. Cleave spent three days serving food to residents from war zones including Somalia, Eritrea and the Balkans. He explained: [...] "I got talking {{with some of them}} and said why are you here? Why are you in prison? It's not illegal and yet we concentrate them in these places. It's a text-book definition of a concentration camp. The conditions are appalling. I was shocked enough <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> be the end of my light comedy book of my amusing summers working as a labourer." [...] Cleave believes he would not have written the novel were he not a parent, as he does not wish for his children [...] "to grow up into a world that is callous and stupid." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} 1997 design document for {{the game}} privileges character development over all other parts, including experimental sequences and technology demos. They wanted players to consider [...] "who they wanted to be" [...] in the game, and <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> be connected to how they behaved in the game. In this way, the game world was [...] "deeply simulated": real and common sense enough to be believed that the player may think about solving the game problems in creative and emergent ways without seeing distinct puzzles. The developers also wanted [...] "choice" [...] with [...] "consequence"—what Spector called the team's [...] "two most frequently uttered words". Their simulation {{was not able to}} maintain that level of openness, and the team had to force [...] "skill", [...] "action", and [...] "character interaction" [...] paths through the levels. Spector compared this technique to the practices of Ultima developers, though he felt his team did it [...] "more consciously and ... effectively". Spector later credited Konami's 1995 role-playing video game Suikoden as an inspiration, stating that the limited choices in Suikoden inspired him to expand on the idea with more meaningful choices in Deux Ex.|$|E

500|$|The third pod of {{the season}} [...] "ties {{together}} [...] thematically", taking the characters into the virtual world of the Framework, where their lives {{are different from the}} real world. This explores [...] "what if" [...] scenarios for many of the characters by showing who they may have been if a major regret of their life was changed, hence the pod's title, Agents of Hydra. This continues the season's focus on the nature of identity and reality, having [...] "payoff to all the reflection on the past" [...] such as Mack's tragic loss of his daughter and Fitz's troubled relationship with his father. Bennet called the pod [...] "very relevant. It's definitely a theme that I think has been kind of hopping around in pop culture at the moment. But it's kind of like a fun Marvel take on that. For all those people who wished to see these characters in a different light, {{this is going to be}} the time <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> happen."

500|$|Mario Kart DS is {{the first}} Mario Kart {{iteration}} to support online play. Konno remarked that although both Mario Kart DS and the Halo series of games feature online play, he noted {{that most of the}} people who use the feature in Halo games were [...] "hardcore gamers". With Mario Kart DS, Konno wants [...] "everyone to go online, and the technology and time is right <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> happen". Continuing with the tradition of introducing a new gameplay mechanic in each Mario Kart game, Mario Kart DS {{is the first}} in the series to support up to eight players at the same time with game cartridges. New to the series, the game also includes a single-player Battle Mode, which does not require that there be at least two human participants. As the first Mario Kart game for the Nintendo DS, the developers tested several features that took advantage of the device's bottom touchscreen. They considered letting players place items anywhere on the track instead of just behind their kart. However, the developers found it too confusing because the game already had too many distractions, making it difficult to control where to place items while racing.|$|E
500|$|Cantor was {{promoted}} to Extraordinary Professor in 1872 and made full Professor in 1879. To attain the latter rank {{at the age of}} 34 was a notable accomplishment, but Cantor desired a chair at a more prestigious university, in particular at Berlin, at that time the leading German university. However, his work encountered too much opposition <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> be possible. Kronecker, who headed mathematics at Berlin until his death in 1891, became increasingly uncomfortable with the prospect of having Cantor as a colleague, perceiving him as a [...] "corrupter of youth" [...] for teaching his ideas to a younger generation of mathematicians. Worse yet, Kronecker, a well-established figure within the mathematical community and Cantor's former professor, disagreed fundamentally with the thrust of Cantor's work ever since he intentionally delayed the publication of Cantor's first major publication in 1874. Kronecker, now seen as {{one of the founders of}} the constructive viewpoint in mathematics, disliked much of Cantor's set theory because it asserted the existence of sets satisfying certain properties, without giving specific examples of sets whose members did indeed satisfy those properties. Whenever Cantor applied for a post in Berlin, he was declined, and it usually involved Kronecker, so Cantor came to believe that Kronecker's stance would make it impossible for him ever to leave Halle.|$|E
