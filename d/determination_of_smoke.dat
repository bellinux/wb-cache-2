40|$|AbstractMechanical {{air supply}} method {{is the most}} common smoke proof method that be used in {{stairwell}} to control the spread of smoke. The determination of the amount of mechanical air supply is a difficult problem in engineering design of mechanical smoke control. Comparison and analysis on the smoke control volume flow rate of the actual project were performed in this paper, and then CFD simulation was performed with different smoke control volume flow rate. Results show that the mechanical smoke control volume flow rate provided by either codes provision or calculation method has value range, thus uncertainty is brought into the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> control volume flow rate. In actual engineering design, appropriate smoke control volume flow rate can be obtained through numerical simulation on the basis of formula calculation and code provision...|$|E

40|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in smoked food can reach levels hazardous {{for the human}} health, especially when the smoking procedure is carried out under uncontrolled conditions. In this work a simple and rapid method for the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> PAHs in <b>smoked</b> fish samples is described. PAHs were extracted from the insoluble samples (together with fat substances) by homogenization with acidified chloroform. The fat extract was then submitted to a first LC sample preparation step (performed on a large silica column) to isolate PAHs from triglycerides.

40|$|In {{this work}} a new {{simplified}} procedure for isolation and <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> PAH in <b>smoked</b> meat products was developed. This procedure is using ASE as selective extraction technique. Its principle is addition of silicagel activated during 18 hours at 140 °C {{directly to the}} extraction cell in ratio 10 g to 1 g of homogenized sample. In the next step the sample is extracted by n-hexane at 100 °C and 10 MPa for three 10 minutes static extraction cycles. The flush volume is 60 % and the purge time 120 sec. During the extraction silicagel adsorb koextracted lipids and thus the obtained extract is suitable for immediate HPLC-FLD analysis. On the contrary, the classical extraction procedures with nonpolar solvent require difficult purification of extract for removal of unwanted lipids. Mostly applied techniques here are GPC and SPE. The new procedure was validated for <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> B[a]P {{as well as for}} <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> 4 PAH (B[a]A, CHR, B[b]F, B[a]P) in smoked sausages. It meets all requirements to be set by Regulation (EC) No 333 / 2007, respective by new Regulation (EC) No 836 / 2011. After the method validation, the content of 4 PAH was investigated in twelve samples <b>of</b> various <b>smoked</b> sausages manufactured in Slovakia.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The growth of the plastic industry {{over the past ten years}} has more than doubled and has been a significant factor in the growing Municipal Solid Waste disposal problems. The objective of this research was to identify toxic species that may be present in selected cellular plastics that could prove harmful to health and environment once disposed. An experimental procedure was established that would simulate foamed plastics in an open burning situation. The data collected is indicative of a incinerator situation, a method of disposal that is becoming more popular as landfills are more restrictive. To determine the possible release and effect of toxic species during combustion four analyses, were conducted. An Arapahoe Smoke Chamber was utilized to determine the smoke mass from selected materials in accordance with ASTM 4100 -D, Standard Gravimetric <b>Determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>Smoke</b> Particulates from Combustion of Plastic Materials. Combustion analysis to determine the concentration (ppm) of NO, and S 02 was conducted through the use of a Bacharach combustion analyzer model 300 NSX combustion analyzer. It was observed that the greatest releases of the by-products was from the materials that were characterized as sponges. The 6 lb/ ft 2 carpet padding had the highest concentration of NOX with 346. 03 ppm/m while undergoing combustion in an enclosed environment. This material also had the greatest concentration of S 02 at 97. 20 ppm/mg. An Anderson 2000 Inc. 1 ACFM Ambient Particle Sizing Sampler (9 stage cascade impactor) was utilized to determine the percent particles that were respirable. The smoke generated during combustion produced particles that were 9195 % respirable. The final analyses conducted was the determination of heavy metals content in the cellular plastic materials.

This new quantitative method {{is based on the}} gas chromatographic-selected ion monitoring-mass spectrometric (GC-SIM-MS) <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> the selected <b>smoke</b> constituents. The accuracy and precision of the approach were well within acceptable parameters with the majority of cases relative standard deviation (RSD) values consistently around 5 %. Sample preparation was simple requiring only the dissolution of the trapped particulate material in a known volume of methanol followed by injection of this clear dark colored solution into the gas chromatograph. This approach represents an advance in the technology in terms of higher sample throughput and less sample workup. Certain products demonstrated consistent trends in concentration of specific chemical classes.

Nicotine, cotinine and thiocyanate, {{in combination with}} a phase-transfer catalyst, were extracted from urine, saliva and hair into dichloromethane (DCM). Thiocyanate was alkylated in the DCM-layer to form a pentafluorobenzyl derivative. The biochemical markers in DCM were directly injected into the GC system and separated on a DB- 1 MS column using a 9. 4 min temperature program. The method was validated in urine and saliva between the limits of quantitation (1. 0 - 15 mug ml(- 1) thiocyanate, 0. 010 - 3. 0 mug ml(- 1) nicotine and cotinine in urine, 0. 010 - 1. 0 mug ml(- 1) nicotine and cotinine in saliva).

40|$|A sample {{pretreatment}} method, solid-phase extraction {{combined with}} dispersive liquid–liquid microextraction (SPE–DLLME), was {{established for the}} sensitive <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in smoked bacon samples. In the SPE–DLLME process, three PAHs including naphthalene (Naph), phenanthrene (Phen) and pyrene (Pyr) were extracted from samples and trans-ferred into C 18 SPE cartridge. The target analytes were subsequently eluted with 1. 2 ml of acetonitrile–dichloromethane (5 : 1, v/v) mixture solution. The eluent was injected directly into the 5. 0 ml ultrapure water in the subsequent DLLME procedure. The sedimented phase was concentrated under a gentle nitrogen flow to 120. 0 ml.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint in wine is {{of worldwide}} concern for grape growers, winemakers {{and the wine}} industry. An improved understanding of the impact <b>of</b> bushfire <b>smoke</b> on grapes and wine is important to enable industry to overcome this challenge. Smoke taint occurs when vineyards are exposed to smoke from bushfires or prescribed bums and can result in wine which exhibits undesirable smoky and ashy aromas and flavours. The prior research summarised in Chapter 1 addresses many of the early knowledge gaps concerning the impact <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> on grape and wine quality such as: the composition <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint, including identification {{of several of the}} volatile compounds involved, and the complex sensory properties imparted to wine that cause the detrimental effects to wine quality. However, these studies do not offer industry many practical solutions to mitigate the incidence or severity <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint. This research reported in Chapter 2 describes several methods for ameliorating smoke taint in wine; i. e. the efficacy of (i) reverse osmosis (RO) and solid phase adsorption, and (ii) commercial fining agents, as treatments for smoke tainted wine. The ability of these methods to reduce the perception of smoke-related sensory attributes and concentrations of smoke-derived volatile phenols are described in two papers, which form the basis for this chapter on the amelioration <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint in wine. The studies reported in Chapter 3 describe the use of spectroscopy as a rapid analytical method for screening wines for smoke taint. The capability of spectroscopic techniques, in combination with chemometrics, to be used for the classification and discrimination of wine are also introduced. The need for rapid detection <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint in grapes and wines was identified as a priority for industry following the demand for analysis of grapes and wine after a fire event. Winemakers operate under considerable time and resource constraints during vintage, thus rapid <b>determinations</b> <b>of</b> fruit quality, including the assessment <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> exposure by fruit, are required. A predictive method employing mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy was developed by scanning control and smoke-affected wines, and applying multivariate data analysis techniques to the resulting data, to generate a calibration model for the classification <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> tainted wines. Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2 D-COS) was also investigated as a novel method for characterising smoke taint in wines. Again, two papers are presented as the basis for a chapter concerning the spectroscopic analysis <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint in wine. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we build}} the {{relational}} models between the height <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> barrier {{and the flow}} of gas, the depth and mean temperature <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> layer in critical value, respectively. These models {{are based on the}} analysis of gas flow in narrow space <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> barrier which is combined with the classic Hydraulic Jump model in the field of mechanics. For different initial conditions of gas, we simulate the effect <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> barrier height on flue gas flow via the fire dynamics simulation software FDS.

40|$|Smoke derived taint in {{grapes and}} wine {{is an issue}} of {{increasing}} significance and severity for the wine industry internationally. On commencement of this research, insufficient knowledge existed as to the effects <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> on grapevines and the development <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint in wine, with no substantial published information. This research was undertaken to investigate the effect <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> exposure to grapevines on the development <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> aromas, flavours and compounds in final wines. As such, this study pioneers the purposeful application <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> to grape bunches and field-grown grapevines to establish the direct link between smoke exposure and the development <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint in wine. This research identified key periods of grapevine sensitivity to smoke uptake as: (1) from shoots 10 cm in length to full-bloom (low levels <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint); (2) from berries pea size to the onset of veraison (variable levels <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint); and (3) from 7 days post veraison to harvest (high levels <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint). A novel smoke application methodology consisting <b>of</b> a <b>smoke</b> generator and greenhouse-grade tent was developed to facilitate the accurate application <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> treatments to field-grown grapevines.

The aim {{of this study was to}} demonstrate the variation in smoke uptake and taint development between and within seasons. METHODS AND RESULTS: Smoke was applied to field-grown Merlot grapevines at 12 stages of vine development over three growing seasons. Key periods of vine sensitivity to smoke taint in wine were (i) from shoots at 10 cm to full bloom (low levels <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint); (ii) from berries at pea size to the onset of veraison (variable levels <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint); and (iii) between 7 days post-veraison and harvest (high levels <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> taint). CONCLUSIONS: The severity of taint in wine varied depending on the phenological timing <b>of</b> grapevine <b>smoke</b> exposure. Taint was elevated when exposure occurred between 7 days post-veraison and harvest. The carry-over <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> constituents the following season was not detectable in wine but yields were reduced. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: This is the first study to demonstrate the timing <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> exposure to critically affect wine chemical and sensory characters. These effects were consistent and reproducible over three seasons. K. R. Kennison, K. L. Wilkinson, A. P. Pollnitz, H. G. Williams and M. R. Gibber...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted in December 2014. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine effect of varied kinds <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> source material on the quality <b>of</b> <b>smoked</b> catfish (pangasius hypophthalmus). There are three kinds <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> source materials used for smoking catfish, namely: coconut shell and coconut husk, the mixture coconut shell and husk. The parameters used to measure the quality <b>of</b> the <b>smoked</b> catfish are sensory value, the content of total acid and total phenols, water content and pH value. The results showed that the use of different kinds <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> source materials significantly affected to the appearance and taste value, total phenols, and the pH value, but did not significantly affect to the value of the texture and smell, moisture content and the content of total acids. The use <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> source mixture <b>of</b> husk and coco shell is the best treatment, showed by the highest sensory value, those are consistence 7. 6, texture 7. 8, odor, 7. 6 smell and taste 7. 7. It means that the smoked fish is shiny and intact, has dense and compact texture, distinctive odor <b>of</b> <b>smoked</b> fish and have a good characteristic flavor <b>of</b> <b>smoked</b> fish. Catfish smoke contained total phenols 15. 78 ppm, total acid 21. 15 %, water content of 30 %, and pH value 7. 22...|$|R
40|$|Figure 1 : Two types <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> {{interacting}} {{like the}} exhaust of aircrafts at aircraft shows. This paper presents a stable method for simulating different types <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> {{in the same}} scene under the presence of varying temperature and vorticity confinement. Multiple types <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> are naturally occurring simultaneously in many different situations like smoke from different fires, smoke {{from different parts of}} the same fire or in aircraft shows where a number of aircrafts emit different colors <b>of</b> <b>smoke.</b> In these kinds of situations temperature differences and rotational details are often important to get physically realistic and visually appealing smoke. The presented method is based on physical realistic simulation <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> using semi-Lagrangian advection and the conjugate gradient method to solve the Navier Stokes equations similar to the Stable Fluids method and extends the Stable Fluids method with multiple types <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> moving in the same velocity field, a temperature field, and vorticity confinement for more realistic simulations of turbulent flows. The method adds three techniques to the Stable Fluids method which gives the possibility of simulating multiple types <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> realistically. The results produced by combining the additional techniques are visually satisfactory and realistic. Results obtained when comparing only each of the additional techniques are comparable to the results obtained by others...|$|R
40|$|<b>Smoke</b> {{contamination}} <b>of</b> balconies {{due to a}} channelled spill plume at a {{lower level}} in an atrium might occur during a fire and could affect occupant safety during an evacuation. Previous experimental work has investigated the extent <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> contamination, and this work describes a numerical modelling comparison of the experiments using the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) computational fluid dynamics programme. Temperature, severity and height <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> contamination are selected as the key parameters for comparison. The predictions of severity and height <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> contamination are generally similar to the experimental results using a ‘most severe point assessment <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> contamination’ assessment method. Although predicted temperatures are slightly lower than experimental values, FDS temperature slice files can be used at the most severe smoke contaminated point using a 10 ?°C temperature rise. This 10 ?°C threshold matches the criterion proposed in the previous experimental research. On {{the basis of the}} comparisons for the height <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> contamination, the simulation results generally match a previously proposed equation for the height <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> contamination above a balcony spill plume...|$|R
50|$|In the {{mechanical}} method smoke is generated {{through the use}} <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> condensates, which are created by the industrial process <b>of</b> turning <b>smoke</b> into a solid or liquid form.

50|$|Polymers are a {{significant}} source <b>of</b> <b>smoke.</b> Aromatic side groups, e.g. in polystyrene, enhance generation <b>of</b> <b>smoke.</b> Aromatic groups integrated in the polymer backbone produce less smoke, likely due to significant charring. Aliphatic polymers tend to generate the least smoke, and are non-self-extinguishing. However presence of additives can significantly increase smoke formation. Phosphorus-based and halogen-based flame retardants decrease production <b>of</b> <b>smoke.</b> Higher degree <b>of</b> cross-linking between the polymer chains has such effect too.|$|R
