5|$|Last Order: Final Fantasy VII is an {{original}} video animation directed by Morio Asaka, written by Kazuhiko Inukai, and animated by Madhouse. It depicts an alternate rendition of two flashbacks found within Final Fantasy VII. It was originally released in Japan on the Advent Pieces DVD, on September 14, 2005. It {{was released in}} North America in the Limited Edition Collector's Set on February 20, 2007. Thus <b>far,</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> not been released on any DVD editions of the film outside Japan or North America.

5|$|One {{special case}} of Maldacena's {{proposal}} says that N=4 super Yang–Mills theory, a gauge theory similar {{in some ways}} to quantum chromodynamics, is equivalent to string theory in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. This result helped clarify the earlier work of 't Hooft on the relationship between string theory and quantum chromodynamics, taking string theory back to its roots as a theory of nuclear physics. Maldacena's results also provided a concrete realization of the holographic principle with important implications for quantum gravity and black hole physics. By the year 2015, Maldacena's paper had become the most highly cited paper in high energy physics with over 10,000 citations. These subsequent articles have provided considerable evidence that the correspondence is correct, although so <b>far</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> not been rigorously proved.|$|E

25|$|The Project is collaborating on {{an archaeological}} {{excavation}} {{at the community}} of Carbonear, Newfoundland, located at Conception Bay and believed the likely location for Carbonariis' mission settlement. The Archaeology of Historic Carbonear Project, carried out by Memorial University of Newfoundland, has conducted summer fieldwork each season since 2011.

25|$|So <b>far,</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> {{been proven}} that {{education}} techniques of compensatory strategies for memory disorders {{are effective in}} individuals with minor traumatic brain injuries. In moderately or severely injured individuals, effective interventions are those appealing to external aids, such as reminders {{in order to facilitate}} particular knowledge or skill acquisition. Reality orientation techniques are also considered; Their purpose is to enhance orientation using stimulation and repetition of the basic orientation information. These techniques are regularly applied in populations of patients primarily presenting with dementia and head-injured patients.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this does}} not mean that there is no further {{development}} in modern physics. The progress of technology over time has led to extremely precise ways of testing the predictions of relativity, and so <b>far</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> successfully passed all tests (such as in particle accelerators to test special relativity, and by astronomical observations to test general relativity). In addition, in the theoretical field there is continuing research intended to unite general relativity and quantum theory. The most promising models are string theory and loop quantum gravity. Some variations of those models also predict violations of Lorentz invariance on a very small scale.|$|E

25|$|Police have {{recovered}} considerable forensic {{evidence in the}} case, but so <b>far</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> served to eliminate one likely suspect, a former boyfriend of her roommate who reportedly expressed anger and resentment toward Hedgepeth, even supposedly threatening to kill her {{if he could not}} reunite with her roommate. His DNA, however, did not match that left at the scene. A note left at the scene, suggesting the writer was jealous, is also believed to have been written by the killer; it was among a large group of documents released by police two years after the crime, following a court action brought by several local media outlets.|$|E
25|$|Another {{concern is}} whether {{countries}} {{which do not}} manufacture vaccines themselves, including those where a pandemic strain is likely to originate, {{will be able to}} purchase vaccine to protect their population. Cost considerations aside, they fear that the countries with vaccine-manufacturing capability will reserve production to protect their own populations and not release vaccines to other countries until their own population is protected. Indonesia has refused to share samples of H5N1 strains which have infected and killed its citizens until it receives assurances that it will have access to vaccines produced with those samples. So <b>far,</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> not received those assurances. However, in September 2009, The United States and France agreed to make 10 percent of their H1N1 vaccine supply available to other countries through the World Health Organization.|$|E

The production became the fastest-selling {{show in the}} theatre's history, and the run was extended by two weeks due to the demand for tickets. In the first collaboration between the Young Vic Theatre and National Theatre Live, the show was broadcast live to over 1100 venues on 16 September 2014.

500|$|The win marked Liverpool's third {{consecutive}} victory against Manchester United, but despite this, manager Houllier refused to get carried away: [...] "At the moment I am worried because the team which {{has won the}} Charity Shield {{in recent years has}} not won the title, I don't think you can draw conclusions from this match." [...] Man of the match Sander Westerveld echoed similar sentiments: [...] "It doesn't say too much about the season. Last year Chelsea beat them 2-0 and had high expectations. We played well and it's a good result but it doesn't say anything about the Championship." [...] Questions were asked about the exclusion of striker Robbie Fowler from the match-day squad, with Houllier confirming the striker had been left out after a training ground bust-up with assistant manager Phil Thompson: [...] "It is a regrettable moment for the team and the club but I'm sure at some stage common sense will prevail. I am leaving it to him. I brokered a get-together between Phil and Robbie, which I attended at the beginning. Then I left the two Scousers together. But so <b>far</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been unsuccessful." [...] Houllier added that he had tried to resolve the issue {{before the start of the}} match: [...] "I waited until the Sunday lunchtime before the Charity Shield game. I again insisted yesterday. I took them together again. I think at some stage it will be solved. I am a patient man." ...|$|E
