50|$|Conditioning of hay {{has become}} popular. The basic {{idea is that}} it {{decreases}} drying time, particularly in humid climates or if rain interferes with haying. Usually, a salt solution is sprayed {{over the top of}} the hay (generally alfalfa) that helps to dry the <b>hay.</b> <b>Conditioning</b> can also refer to the rollers inside a swather that crimps the alfalfa to help squeeze out the moisture.|$|E
50|$|The largest genus, Epicauta, {{contains}} many species toxic to horses. A few beetles consumed {{in a single}} feeding of alfalfa hay may be lethal. In semiarid areas of the western United States, modern harvesting techniques may contribute to cantharidin content in harvested forage. The practice of <b>hay</b> <b>conditioning,</b> crushing the stalks to promote drying, also crushes any beetles present and causes the release of cantharidin into the fodder. Blister beetles are attracted to alfalfa and weeds during bloom. Reducing weeds and timing harvests before and after bloom are sound management practices. Using equipment without hay conditioners may reduce beetle mortality {{and allow them to}} escape before baling.|$|E
40|$|Ruminants {{generally}} {{succeed in}} selecting an appropriate diet {{relative to their}} nutrient requirements, and macronutrients such as energy and protein are considered as playing a primary role in their food preferences. Diet learning through post-ingestive consequences, evidenced by many studies that involved situations with simple discrimination tasks, may explain this ability to select a suitable diet. However, in more complex feeding environments where animals are faced with many plants varying both in their energy and protein contents, {{the extent to which}} such a mechanism operates is still uncertain. Our objective was to investigate a more complex feeding situation than previously tested and to determine whether lambs were able to associate three forages with both energy-based and protein-based post-ingestive consequences of various intensities. The doses of starch and casein used to elicit these post-ingestive consequences were chosen so that the apparent metabolisable energy and crude protein values of hays were within the range found in plants normally encountered under field conditions. We applied five treatments: EmPm, EhPm, EmPh, EhPh, where medium (m) or high (h) levels of nutrients (E 5 energy and P 5 protein) were associated with different hays, and E 0 N 0 where no stimuli were associated. Each animal experienced only three treatments: E 0 N 0 –EmPm–EhPm or E 0 N 0 –EmPh–EhPh, each one being associated with one <b>hay</b> during <b>conditioning,</b> on the basis of one treatment per day over three consecutive days. Animals then had a choice between the hay associated with E 0 N 0 and one of the two others, successively on the two following days. This procedure was repeated through five 1 -week-long periods, and applied to two groups of lambs (n 512) maintained at feeding levels sufficient for maintenance or for a 150 g/day growth rate. This experiment was complemented by a methodological trial that aimed to estimate the doses of starch and casein eliciting preferences and a post-trial that aimed to evaluate the effect of our treatments on sheep ruminal environment. The methodological trial showed that lambs perceived the stimuli and the doses, and the post-trial showed that treatments affected the ruminal environment. In the main experiment, the lambs preferred the rewarded hays but did not discriminate in their choices the variation of post-ingestive consequences due to energy and protein. This suggests that in situations closer to reality where animals experience many foods varying in nutrient contents, the learning process may be impaired. The lambs do not seem to have strictly relied on it for shaping their diet choices...|$|R
