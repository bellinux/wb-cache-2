Specifically, the study aimed at examining {{the extent to which}} technological change, quality of staffing and restructuring leads to TTCL efficiency. This study used both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) tool was used in analysing the data. The findings of the study reveal that TTCL evidently is efficiency in terms of technology although there is a competition from other major telephone operators in Tanzania. TTCL is still the sole provider of landline telephone services in Tanzania. It operates on CDMA 2000 1 X technology with operating frequency band of 800 MHz and have mandatory to national optic fiber network. Moreover, the findings reveal that in this competitive environment TTCL has managed to deliver an <b>intelligent</b> <b>Network</b> <b>platform</b> such as, prepaid services, a Voice mail System, a Short Message Service Centre, Customer Care and Billing system. All these have allowed best speed mobile data services across the country. The study has also recommended a number of issues for the success of the Company. Implications of the findings is to caution the government and TTCL privatization; on well defined policy which specify conditions of the contract, well set goals of the privatization like network expansion, introduction of new technology, stated number of worker’s and company structure to fulfill the mission. ...|$|E

30|$|The {{network of}} radar sensors should operate with {{multiple}} goals managed by an <b>intelligent</b> <b>platform</b> <b>network</b> that can manage {{the dynamics of}} each radar to meet the common goals of the platform [1, 2], rather than each radar to operate as an independent system. Therefore, it is significant to perform signal design and processing, and networking cooperatively within and between platforms of radar sensors and their communication modules [3]. In addition, radar sensor network’s performance can be greatly enhanced by changing the radar’s algorithms as the mission changes (mission aware), {{and it is also}} very important that the radar sensor network has autonomous capabilities [4, 5]: self-organizing, self-healing, self-reconfiguring, and self-managing [6], etc. Quite often, MIMO interference channels are applied to radar sensor networks [7], and for self-managing purpose, interference management in MIMO interference channels is critical, especially when the channel conditions are not friendly such as foliage environment [8]. In this paper, we study interference alignment in MIMO interference channels.|$|R

The RSNs are promised to operate with multiple goals managed by an <b>intelligent</b> <b>platform</b> <b>network</b> that can manage the dynamics of each radar member to meet the common goals of the platform, rather than each radar to operate as an independent system. This is the so-called cooperative radar networks with communication function [6]. While the performance of RSNs degrades because the radar members are likely to interfere with each other if their waveforms are not orthogonally designed, or their polarized states of the waveforms are not properly allocated [7]. In order to eliminate these interferences, much {{attention has been paid}} to the waveform design for RSNs [4 – 7, 9, 10]. The utilization of the polarization information for RSNs attracts relatively little attention than the waveform design, while our work tries to exploit the polarization information of the electromagnetic (EM) waves for RSNs, and we expect to seek an effective and easy implementation for RSNs to mitigate the interferences based on the use of the polarization information.|$|R

40|$|The <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Network</b> {{architecture}} {{is an extension}} of the existing telephone network architecture to provide centralised definition and control of services. This architecture allows enormous flexibility in introduction of new services, and allows customers to define and control their own services with a large degree of independence from network providers. This thesis is concerned with systematic modelling and analysis <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Networks</b> and <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Network</b> services. There is a significant body of prior art on queueing network modelling of the signalling networks and switching equipment which comprise <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Networks.</b> The first part of the dissertation defines a scheme for systematically translating <b>intelligent</b> <b>network</b> service definitions into parameters for such queueing network models. A representation syntax for services is defined for this purpose, and the steps required to translate a service to analysable form are defined with the aid of this syntax. The second part of the dissertation extends existing queueing network analysis techniques to obtain certain performance measures which are important in the analysis of <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Networks,</b> and which are lacking in previous work. In particular, the calculation of completion time distributions for entire call set-ups, as opposed delays at individual devices, is calculated. Telecommunications switches may use simple priority-based approaches to preserve throughput under congestion conditions. Such measures have previously been observed to cause oscillatory behaviour in voice switches, through a mechanism known as 2 ̆ 2 traffic synchronisation 2 ̆ 2. Similar behaviour is observed in a seemingly straight-forward model of a signalling <b>network</b> supporting <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Network</b> transactions. This is investigated fully in the third part of this thesis. Traffic synchronisation in <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Networks</b> leads to connection establishment delays significantly greater than those predicted by standard queueing analysis techniques. A n analysis technique quantifying these delays is developed and validated by comparison with simulations. The trade-off between prevention of traffic synchronisation at normal loads and preserving throughput at overloads is also considered. A congestion avoidance technique which prevents traffic synchronisation at little performance cost is described and analysed...|$|R
