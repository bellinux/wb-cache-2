40|$|Abstract—Fractures of distal <b>end</b> <b>radius</b> {{are most}} common {{fractures}} {{of the upper}} limb. Various techniques have been described including closed reduction, percutaneous fixation and open reduction and fixation. This {{study was conducted to}} assess the functional and radiological outcomes of volar plate osteosynthesis to manage intra-articular distal <b>end</b> <b>radius</b> fracture. For this study, 30 patients with intraarticular distal <b>end</b> <b>radius</b> fractures involving radiocarpal joint operated with open reduction and internal fixation with the volar plate were taken. Minimum follow up 6 months were done. During the follow-up, radiological parameters were assessed in terms of radial length, radial inclination, radial (palmar) tilt, articular step-off, functional parameters were assessed in terms of range of motion i. e. dorsifleion, plantar flexion, pronation, supination radial and ulnar deviation and Gartland and Werley score. Mean age of patients was 46. 8 years with male: female ratio 6 : 4. Mean radial height was 11. 2 mm, mean radial inclination was 21. 8 degree and mean radial (palmar) tilt was 10 degrees. Average Gartland and Werley score was 3. 6. Average dorsiflexion was 71 degrees, palmar flexion was 68 degrees, mean radial deviation was 16 degrees and mean ulnar deviation was 29 degrees. Mean pronation was 72 degrees and mean supination was 75 degrees. It was concluded that volar plating has good outcome for intraarticular distal <b>end</b> fractures of <b>radius</b> with minimal complications. So, it should be considered as the first line of management for intraarticular distal <b>end</b> <b>radius</b> fracture...|$|R

40|$|Background: Extra-articular {{fractures}} {{of lower}} <b>end</b> <b>radius</b> are conventionally immobilized in palmar flexion and ulnar deviation. In view of poor functional results, the conventional method of immobilization is {{giving way to}} dorsiflexed-immobilized method. The aim of our study is to evaluate and compare the radiological and functional outcome in extra-articular fractures of lower <b>end</b> <b>radius</b> treated conservatively with respect to its position of immobilization. Materials and Methods: Sixty-four patients, all above 20 years of age with closed extra-articular fractures of lower <b>end</b> <b>radius</b> who were treated conservatively by close reduction and below elbow cast application constitute the clinical material. Irrespective of fracture geometry the patients were randomly allocated to dorsal or palmar flexed immobilized position of wrist. Patients were followed up for a minimum six-month period. The radial tilt, palmar tilt and ulnar variance are measured at prereduction, postreduction and at 6 month followup. The results were scored by Demerit Scoring System of Saito. Results: All fractures united. Individual movement of dorsiflexion, palmar flexion, supination, pronation and radial-ulnar deviation were all significantly better in the dorsiflexed-immobilized group {{as compared with the}} palmar flexed immobilized group. Grip strength recovery with subjective assessment was better in the dorsiflexed group (77 &#x 0025;) as compared to the palmar flexed group (23 &#x 0025;). Radiological parameters were markedly better in the dorsiflexed group. Ninety-one per cent of patients in the dorsiflexed group had excellent to good results as compared to 66 &#x 0025; in the palmar flexed group. Conclusion: Functional results of extra-articular fractures of lower <b>end</b> <b>radius</b> are superior if the fractures after reduction are immobilized in dorsiflexion of wrist rather than in conventional palmar flexion position...|$|R
