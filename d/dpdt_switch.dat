5000|$|A [...] "4-way" [...] (intermediate) switch is {{a purpose}} built double pole, double throw (<b>DPDT)</b> <b>switch,</b> {{internally}} wired in manufacture {{to reverse the}} connections between the input and output and having only four external terminals. This switch has two pairs of [...] "traveler" [...] terminals that it connects either straight through, or crossed over (transposed, or swapped). An intermediate switch can, however, be implemented by adding appropriate external wiring to an ordinary (six terminal) <b>DPDT</b> <b>switch,</b> or by using a separate DPDT relay.|$|E
50|$|A <b>DPDT</b> <b>switch</b> has six connections, {{but since}} {{polarity}} reversal {{is a very}} common usage of DPDT switches, some variations of the <b>DPDT</b> <b>switch</b> are internally wired specifically for polarity reversal. These crossover switches only have four terminals rather than six. Two of the terminals are inputs and two are outputs. When connected to a battery or other DC source, the 4-way switch selects from either normal or reversed polarity. Such switches {{can also be used}} as intermediate switches in a multiway switching system for control of lamps by more than two switches.|$|E

50|$|When {{more than}} one common {{terminal}} is used, the number of poles increases. Figure 1C shows a double-pole, single-throw (DPST) switch. Both poles are actuated simultaneously when the relay is energized. In this case, both poles are either always closed or always open. Figure 1D illustrates a double-pole, double throw (<b>DPDT)</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E
50|$|Locomotives {{fitted with}} a Zero 1 decoder {{according}} to Hornby's instructions {{could not be used}} on conventional systems, making it difficult to run locomotives across multiple layouts. It was possible to include a miniature <b>DPDT</b> <b>switch</b> in the installation to enable the Zero 1 decoder to be switched out for use on a conventional system.|$|E
50|$|These audio outputs {{are each}} mixed in a linear {{balanced}} mixer with a carrier. The carrier drive {{for one of}} these mixers is also shifted by 90°. The outputs of these mixers are added in a linear circuit to give the SSB signal by phase cancellation of one of the sidebands. Connecting the 90° delayed signal from either the audio or the carrier (but not both) to the other mixer will reverse the sideband, so either USB or LSB is available with a simple <b>DPDT</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E

Switching circuit consisting of Double Pole Double Throw (<b>DPDT)</b> <b>switches,</b> thyristor, and triggering circuit is developed and tested. The coil current is measured using a Hall-effect current sensor. The magnetic pulse generated is measured and tabulated in a graph. Simulation using Finite Element Method Magnetics (FEMM) is done to compare the results obtained between experiment and simulation. Results show that increasing the capacitance of the capacitor bank will increase the output voltage.

5000|$|In {{building}} wiring, multiway switching is the interconnection {{of two or}} more electrical {{switches to}} control an electrical load (often, but not always, lighting) from more than one location. For example, this allows lighting in a hallway, stairwell or large room to be controlled from multiple locations.While a [...] "normal" [...] light switch needs to be only a single pole, single throw (SPST) switch, multiway switching requires the use of switches that have one or more additional contacts and two or more wires must be run between the switches. When the load is controlled from only two points, single pole, double throw (SPDT) switches are used. Double pole, double throw (<b>DPDT)</b> <b>switches</b> allow control from three or more locations.|$|R
50|$|Likewise, the two {{coils of}} a humbucker which are {{wired in series}} can be {{connected}} in parallel. This results in a brighter sound and lower output resembling that of a single-coil pickup. Compared to coil split the sound is usually a bit fuller and the pickup's hum-cancelling properties are retained. Like coil split, wiring a humbucker in parallel requires the start and end of both coils to be accessible, which is sometimes possible with stock pickups. Unlike coil split, it also requires a <b>DPDT</b> <b>switch</b> (coil split only requires a SPDT switch).|$|E
5000|$|All models {{featured}} a solid mahogany body, solid mahogany set neck, rosewood fretboard, two humbucker pickups, two volume controls, one master tone control, and a <b>DPDT</b> <b>switch</b> used for coil tapping.The Genesis also {{featured a}}n elongated headstock with 3 + 3 tuners, 22 frets, a front-mounted output jack, a Tune-o-matic bridge, and stop tailpiece. The new PRO model includes two tone and two push/pull volume controls that coil split each humbucker individually. The jack has been relocated {{to the standard}} Les Paul positioning and the two humbucker pickups are covered on all models.|$|E
50|$|A humbucker pickup is {{electrically}} equivalent two single-coil pickups wired {{together in}} series. Coil splitting involves shorting {{one of the}} coils to ground, essentially turning the humbucker into a single-coil pickup (not a perfect replica, though, as the magnetic circuits of the two pickup types are different). This is usually done with a <b>DPDT</b> <b>switch,</b> but can also be done with a push-pull pot. Some manufacturers have used a pot to vary the amount of signal shorted to ground from one coil, thus producing a range of tones between a humbucker and a single-coil. Coil splitting results in a sound that's brighter and has less output than a full humbucker. It also eliminates the humbucker's noise-cancelling properties. This modification requires the start and end of both coils to be exposed, which is more commonly available on aftermarket than stock pickups.|$|E

40|$|A {{wideband}} circular polarization-reconfigurable (CPR) {{slot antenna}} with compact size for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) applications is presented. The antenna {{consists of a}} rectangular-loop slot, a microstrip feed line, a Wilkinson power divider, a 90 °-phase shifter, a double-pole double-throw (<b>DPDT)</b> <b>switch,</b> and two L-shaped feeding stubs. For size reduction, four T-shaped stubs are symmetrically placed inside the rectangular-loop slot. Wideband operation of the 90 °-phase shifter is constructed using a microstrip line and a lumped-element composite right/left-handed transmission-line (LE-CRLH TL). The input signal is split into two signals with equal amplitude and 90 °-phase difference by the Wilkinson power divider and the 90 °-phase shifter, and then fed to the corresponding L-shaped feeding stubs. The DC control voltages to the <b>DPDT</b> <b>switch</b> determine if the antenna generates a right-handed or left-handed CP signal.

40|$|The NLAS 6233 is a <b>DPDT</b> <b>switch</b> {{featuring}} Popless {{noise suppression}} circuitry {{designed to prevent}} pass through of undesirable transient signals known as pops.

The Popless noise suppression circuitry controls the ON and OFF times that define the time interval when switching between the normally open (NO) and normally closed (NC) terminals. This allows any pops to be dissipated within the system before the switch settles into a closed position.

5000|$|Some guitars {{which have}} humbucking pickups feature [...] "coil splits", which allow the pickups {{to act as}} [...] "pseudo-single" [...] coils by either {{short-circuiting}} or bypassing one coil. The electrical circuit of the pickup is reduced {{to that of a}} true single coil so there is no hum canceling effect. Usually, this feature is activated using a miniature toggle <b>switch</b> or a <b>DPDT</b> push-pull <b>switch</b> mounted on a potentiometer. Some guitars (e.g., the Peavey T-60 and the Fender Classic Player Jaguar HH) make use of a variable coil split circuit that allows the guitarist to dial a variable amount of signal from the second coil, from pure single-coil to full humbucker and everything in-between.|$|R
40|$|Synthetic biology has {{significantly}} advanced {{the design of}} synthetic control devices, gene circuits and networks that can reprogram mammalian cells in a trigger-inducible manner. Prokaryotic helix-turn-helix motifs have become the standard resource to design synthetic mammalian transcription factors that tune chimeric promoters in a small molecule-responsive manner. We have identified a family of Actinomycetes transcriptional repressor proteins showing a tandem TetR-family signature and have used a synthetic biology-inspired approach to reveal the potential control dynamics of these bi-partite regulators. Daisy-chain assembly of well-characterized prokaryotic repressor proteins such as TetR, ScbR, TtgR or VanR and fusion to either the Herpes simplex transactivation domain VP 16 or the Krueppel-associated box domain (KRAB) of the human kox- 1 gene resulted in synthetic bi- and even tri-partite mammalian transcription factors that could reversibly program their individual chimeric or hybrid promoters for trigger-adjustable transgene expression using tetracycline (TET), γ-butyrolactones, phloretin and vanillic acid. Detailed characterization of the bi-partite ScbR-TetR-VP 16 (ST-TA) transcription factor revealed independent control of TET- and γ-butyrolactone-responsive promoters at high and double-pole double-throw (<b>DPDT)</b> relay <b>switch</b> qualities at low intracellular concentrations. Similar to electromagnetically operated mechanical <b>DPDT</b> relay <b>switches</b> that control two electric circuits by a fully isolated low-power signal, TET programs ST-TA to progressively switch from TetR-specific promoter-driven expression of transgene one to ScbR-specific promoter-driven transcription of transgene two while ST-TA flips back to exclusive transgene 1 expression {{in the absence of}} the trigger antibiotic. We suggest that natural repressors and activators with tandem TetR-family signatures may also provide independent as well as DPDT-mediated control of two sets of transgenes in bacteria, and that their synthetic transcription-factor analogs may enable the design of compact therapeutic gene circuits for gene and cell-based therapie...|$|R
40|$|The NLAS 44599 is an {{advanced}} dual−independent CMOS double pole−double throw (<b>DPDT)</b> analog <b>switch</b> fabricated with silicon gate CMOS technology.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} design of a novel pivot for a seesaw, RF MEMS, {{double-pole}} double-throw (<b>DPDT)</b> <b>switch,</b> which has been developed to operate within mobile communication systems and devices. The pivot employs a unique ‘S’ structure at the nano scale, in the form of a, which helps to keep von-Mises stresses below 21 MPa. The pivot requires less pulling force than similar designs due to its flexibility which allows the beam and contacts a greater space of separation while the switch is off. This in turn results in improved contact isolation of greater than − 77 dB at 5 GHz. The RF MEMS switch is an improvement over the previously published paper (Al-Amin et al. in International symposium on microelectronics, vol 2013, no 1, pp 000831 – 000835, 2013. doi: 10. 1109 /ECS. 2014. 6892558), since the pulling force of the electrostatic plates can be generated with a voltage which is greatly reduced from 14 to 8 V using the same electrostatic plate area size. The switch is a progression from SPST and DPDT seesaw switching since it provides improved flexibility over the previously described devices. With the redesign of the pivot the switch attains a greater ‘air-gap’ between the contacts when open-circuited which therefore allows for improved isolation during the off-state...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{modelling}} and simulation of a Radio Frequency Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (RF MEMS) switch {{with the use}} of a novel seesaw design providing Double-Pole Double-Throw (DPDT) functionality. This optimises the capabilities of the seesaw design structure for use in mobile communications systems and devices. After researching other available seesaw designs, it was realised that an improvement could be achieved by applying additional contacts. During its development, the <b>DPDT</b> <b>switch</b> achieved a low electrostatic actuation voltage of 14 V, providing the switch with improved compatibility for common voltage levels used in mobile devices.

The length of the switch is 41 µm, which is a suitable size for fabrication and conforms to the Microscale, from 1 µm to 100 µm. Copper Bulk General (Cu) was chosen for the pivot material on its merits of possessing good electrical conductivity and optimised flexibility and stiffness for elastic recovery.

40|$|The past half-century {{witnessed}} {{an evolution}} of {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR). Boosted by digital signal processing (DSP), a variety of SAR imaging algorithms have been developed, in which the wavenumber domain algorithm is mature for airborne SAR and independent of signal waveforms. Apart from the algorithm development, {{there is a growing}} interest in how to acquire the raw data of targets’ echoes before the DSP for SAR imaging in a cost-effective way. For the data acquisition, various studies over the past 15 years have shed light on utilizing the signal generated from the ubiquitous broadband wireless technology – orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). However, the purpose of this thesis is to enable commercial OFDM-based wireless systems to work as an airborne SAR sensor. The unlicensed devices of Worldwide interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) are the first option, owing to their accessibility, similarity and economy. This dissertation first demonstrates the feasibility of applying WiMAX to SAR by discussing their similar features. Despite the similarities they share, the compatibility of the two technologies is undermined by a series of problems resulted from WiMAX transceiver mechanisms and industrial rules for radiated power. In order to directly apply commercial WiMAX base station transceivers in unlicensed band to airborne SAR application, we propose a radio-frequency (RF) front design together with a signal processing means. To be specific, a double-pole, double-throw (<b>DPDT)</b> <b>switch</b> is inserted between an antenna and two WiMAX transceivers for generating pulsed signal. By simulations, the transmitted power of the SAR sensor is lower than 0 dBm, while its imaging range can be over 10 km for targets with relatively large radar cross section (RCS), such as a ship. Its range resolution is 9. 6 m whereas its cross-range resolution is finer than 1 m. Equipped with the multi-mode, this SAR sensor is further enhanced to satisfy the requirements of diversified SAR applications. For example, the width of the scan-mode SAR’s range swath is 2. 1 km, over five times the width of other modes. Vital developed Matlab code is given in Appendix D, and its correctness is shown by comparing with the image of chirped SAR. To summarize, the significance of this dissertation is to propose, for the first time, a design of directly leveraging commercial OFDM-based systems for airborne SAR imaging. Compared with existing designs of airborne SAR, it is a promising low-cost solution...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the designs of}} a multi-band slot antenna, a frequency-reconfigurable (FR) monopole antenna, a frequency-reconfigurable multiple-input-multiple-output (FR MIMO) antenna, a polarization-reconfigurable (PR) monopole antenna, a new metasurface (MS) and a circular-polarization-reconfigurable metasurface (CPR MS) monopole antenna. The multi-band slot antenna consists of a rectangular slot, a T-shaped feeding patch, an inverted T-shaped stub and two E-shaped stubs and has a compact area. The rectangular slot and the inverted T-shaped stub together generate the 1 st band. The two E-shaped stubs operating as monopole radiators generate the 2 nd band. By using a double-folded stub in the T-shaped feeding patch, two resonant frequencies, i. e., 3 rd and 4 th bands, can be generated and tuned independently. With this method, the slot antenna can have four operating bands and a size smaller than the previous works. The effect of the feeding cable used in measurement and of the cover used in wireless devices is also investigated. In the FR planar monopole antenna, the radiator consists of two sections, section I and II, which are connected together using a PIN-diode. Section I alone generates a high-frequency band, while section II, when electrically connected together with section I using the PIN-diode, generates a low-frequency band. The radiator of the antenna is meandered for compact size. Continuous tuning of the two operating bands is accomplished by placing a varactor on section I of the radiator, leading to a wide tuning range of 2. 39 - 3. 0 GHz. With {{the use of this}} technique, a FR monopole antenna and a FR MIMO monopole antenna with wide-continuous tuning are designed. In the FR MIMO monopole antenna, a reconfigurable defected ground structure (DGS) employing two PIN diodes is designed to switch isolation across the whole tuning band. A simple and novel biasing circuit using only three direct current (DC) wires is designed to bias the diodes. The PR monopole antenna consists of two meandered radiators placed perpendicular to each other, a feeding network using the Wilkinson power divider, two switchable 900 -phase shifters with PIN-diode switches for control, and a DGS. The antenna is more compact and has a wider axial-ratio bandwidth than those of the previous PR antennas. A phase shifter and a double-pole double-throw (<b>DPDT)</b> <b>switch</b> are used to reduce the complexity of the biasing circuit, and a metallic reflector is placed {{at the back of the}} antenna to increase the boresight gain. The dual-cap mushroom-like metasurface (MS) is a new design, with each unit cell having a simple patch with a centered via on one side of the substrate and a meandered slot on the other side. The meandered slot introduces inductive effect to lower down the operating frequency and increase the operating bandwidth. The dual-cap mushroom-like MS is used in the design of a compact CPR MS monopole antenna to enhance the boresight gain and bandwidth. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
