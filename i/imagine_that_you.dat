500|$|In his memoirs, one guard {{recalled}} that {{on one occasion}} another guard forgot himself and told an off-color joke to the grand duchesses during one of these meetings. The offended Tatiana ran from the room, [...] "pale as death." [...] Maria eyed the man and said, [...] "Why are you not disgusted with yourselves when you use such shameful words? Do you <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can woo a well-born woman with such witticisms and have her be well disposed towards you? Be refined and respectable men {{and then we can}} get along." [...] Ivan Kleschev, a 21-year-old guard, declared that he intended to marry one of the grand duchesses and if her parents said no he would rescue her from the Ipatiev House himself.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the input}} is a random permutation, the pivot has a random rank, {{and so it}} is not {{guaranteed}} {{to be in the middle}} 50 percent. However, when we start from a random permutation, in each recursive call the pivot has a random rank in its list, {{and so it is}} in the middle 50 percent about half the time. That is good enough. <b>Imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> flip a coin: heads means that the rank of the pivot is in the middle 50 percent, tail means that it isn't. <b>Imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are flipping a coin over and over until you get [...] heads. Although this could take a long time, on average only [...] flips are required, and the chance that you won't get [...] heads after [...] flips is highly improbable (this can be made rigorous using Chernoff bounds). By the same argument, Quicksort's recursion will terminate on average at a call depth of only [...] But if its average call depth is , and each level of the call tree processes at most [...] elements, the total amount of work done on average is the product, [...] Note that the algorithm does not have to verify that the pivot is in the middle half—if we hit it any constant fraction of the times, that is enough for the desired complexity.|$|E

6000|$|... "One <b>imagines</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> did {{not know}} Don Martin," [...] Gomez said lightly, {{although}} there was a keen look in his narrowed eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is in {{a little}} village some five hundred miles across the frontier, in Siberia. I had <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> might have known." ...|$|R
2500|$|About the performance-capture process Singer stated, [...] "It's fascinating... It {{takes you}} back to play-acting as a kid {{in your living room}} because you are running around and having to <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are in Gantua and imagine that there are these weapons and all these giant things. But there's nothing when you are there other than {{styrofoam}} and blocks. It forces the actors to regress to when they would play-act as kids or do minimalist theatre. But in that way it's fascinating - I can see why Robert Zemeckis and James Cameron have started to shoot pictures this way".|$|E
2500|$|In the Orthodox Church {{there are}} no [...] "categories" [...] of sin as found in the Christian West. In the pre-Vatican II Catholic catechism, sins were {{categorized}} as [...] "mortal" [...] and [...] "venial." [...] In this definition, a [...] "mortal" [...] sin was one which would prevent someone from entering heaven unless one confessed it before death... These categories do {{not exist in the}} Orthodox Church. Sin is sin. Concerning Confession, having a list of deadly sins could, in fact, become an obstacle to genuine repentance. For example, <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> commit a sin. You look on the list and do not find it listed. It would be very easy to take the attitude that, since it is not on a list of deadly sins, it is not too serious. Hence, you do not feel the need to seek God's forgiveness right away. A week passes and you have completely forgotten about what you had done. You never sought God's forgiveness; as a result, you did not receive it, either. We should go to Confession when we sin—at the very least, we should ask God to forgive us daily in our personal prayers. We should not see Confession as a time to confess only those sins which may be found on a list.|$|E
6000|$|... "They're {{almost at}} your door. One would <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could {{indulge in a}} {{scramble}} among them whenever it pleased you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then if he <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> saw him, {{it would}} make a difference," [...] Foster said thoughtfully, [...] "He'd reckon <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were the {{greatest}} danger he had to guard against." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems so}} strange to me, Mr. Burke," [...] said Mrs. Cliff, {{after a few}} moments' silence. [...] "I never <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would care for Willy Croup." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not," [...] she admitted. [...] "Indeed, I'll {{confess that}} I was {{somewhat}} startled {{when you came}} in. <b>You</b> see, I <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were still in Canada." ...|$|R
6000|$|Challoner {{regarded}} {{her with a}} stern smile. [...] "One would <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are trying to heighten {{the value of your}} silence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{are human}} beings, even though England and America {{respectively}} had the intense good fortune of seeing your birth.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] said Hilda, [...] "it doesn't matter, but {{you have}} a suspiciously complacent look. One could <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> felt {{satisfied}} with yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here," [...] he said, [...] "I've always <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{would go}} far, and I'm {{anxious to see}} you do so. I shouldn't like you to throw {{yourself}} away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] It was {{an exclamation}} of {{satisfaction}} from the Commissioner. [...] "I <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would change your minds. I shall await you, Citizen, {{in the garden}} in five minutes' time." ...|$|R
50|$|In Biber’s Harmonia Artificiosa no. VII, a {{different}} version of scordatura notation is used. Biber uses a nine line staff. The clefs used {{are based on}} alto clef (<b>imagining</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are playing a viola). The piece is written for a six-stringed instrument. The {{upper part of the}} staff supposes <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are playing on the upper four strings and the lower part <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are playing on the lower four strings (still <b>imagining</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are reading the four strings of a viola in alto clef). This does mean that there are two ways of notating notes on the middle two strings but it quickly becomes apparent, when playing, what the correct reading should be.|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] she said. [...] "I {{have been}} foolish. It is absurd to <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could have brought that about by just wishing for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't quite understand," [...] he said. [...] "From {{what you}} say, one would almost <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> thought Mr. Scobell was the {{proprietor}} of this paper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose, young gentleman, {{that you}} come from Saint Cyr or the Polytechnic; {{although}} I should hardly <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have completed your studies, in either of them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Horsfield {{leaned forward}} confidentially. [...] "See here," [...] he said, [...] "I've always <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would go far, and I'm {{anxious to see}} you do so. I wouldn't like you to throw {{yourself}} away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Allow me {{to remind}} you," [...] {{he said at}} length, looking again at his watch, [...] "that I am a little pressed for time. I understood, or <b>imagined,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had {{something}} to say to me--not about roses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One would think," [...] {{said his}} lordship, [...] "that {{you would be}} glad to have the means of {{securing}} your mother from beggary. I <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would have been in some measure gratified by my--my--my good intentions towards your family." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From what I have heard," [...] I remarked, [...] "I should <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> and I are {{the only}} people who have been allowed to go there without qualifications." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Now, lad, let me {{hear the}} whole story,” he said; “but first fill your glass from that bottle. I should <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have almost {{forgotten}} the taste of wine.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{really have}} so {{surprised}} me that I hardly {{know how to}} answer you," [...] said Mrs. Thompson. [...] "Indeed, I cannot bring myself to <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are in earnest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Said I {{wanted to}} see you?" [...] {{repeated}} Susy, with her blue eyes lifted in celestial scorn and wonderment. [...] "Said I {{wanted to see}} you? Are you not mistaken, Mr. Brant? Really, I <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> came here to see ME." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, I know," [...] {{returned}} her aunt, [...] "and I {{have not been}} foolish enough to invite the bar without the magnet. And yet, Mr. Crocker," [...] she went on playfully, [...] "I had <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were the one man in a hundred who did not need an inducement." ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{both laughed}} {{and they both}} just {{appeared}} uncertain, but Vanderbank spoke first. [...] "I don't <b>imagine,</b> Nanda, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> really know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of a Christmas-tree,' said James, laughing. 'You {{may have}} your own way. I have too much {{confidence}} in your discretion and in theirs to <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will produce the least effect.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My good Miss Charlecote,' {{said the}} captain, who {{had looked at}} her with {{somewhat}} of a pitying smile, instead of attending to her last words, 'do you <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know that boy?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, Frankie, we {{have had}} about enough of this nonsense,' said she. 'Don't <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{are going to get}} out of this thing so easily. I've got you, and I'll keep you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{had hidden}} your motive? Can <b>you</b> believe <b>that</b> {{a man could}} change his whole mode of life and take up a burden he had {{carefully}} avoided, as you have done, without having the woman on whose account he did it understand why? Are we so blind or utterly foolish? Don't <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> our perceptions and intuitions are twice as keen as yours?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, [...] "I'll {{be frank}} with you. I {{came into this}} little affair {{for the sake of}} a pal. It was only by {{accident}} that I found my way up yonder--more to look after him than anything. I never <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would have anything to say that was interesting to me. Seems I was wrong, though. You've got things very nicely worked out, Mr. Selingman." ...|$|R
6000|$|Alb. How can I speak, or how, sir, can <b>you</b> hear? [...] <b>Imagine</b> <b>that</b> which <b>you</b> {{would most}} deplore, [...] And that, which I would speak, is it, or more.|$|R
