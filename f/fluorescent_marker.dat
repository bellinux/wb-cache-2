40|$|International audienceFluorescence imaging locates <b>fluorescent</b> <b>markers</b> that {{specifically}} bind to tumors: markers are injected to a patient, and optimally excited with near infrared light. To investigate thick media, as the fluorescence signal decreases {{with the light}} travel distance, the autofluorescence of biological tissues becomes a limiting factor. To remove autofluorescence and isolate specific fluorescence, a spectroscopic approach, based on Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), is explored. A murine breast cancer cell line (5. 106 TS/Apc cells in 200 µL sterile DPBS) was implanted subcutaneously in female nude mouse. Twelve days after tumor cells implantation, <b>fluorescent</b> <b>markers</b> (AngioStamp,Fluoptics-Grenoble-France) were injected intravenously (50 nmol, 200 µL). Two days after marker injection, a spectral acquisition is performed. The animal is illuminated with a laser at 690 nm and the emitted back fluorescence signal is collected by an imaging spectrometer coupled with a CCD camera. At this point, the ratio between non-specific fluorescence (marker everywhere but in the tumor) and specific fluorescence (marker in the tumor) {{is supposed to be}} optimal for biological analysis, but a non-negligible autofluorescence signal (with a distinct fluorescence spectrum) still remains. We process our NMF algorithm on the spectrally resolved acquisition: the algorithm successfully separated <b>fluorescent</b> <b>markers</b> from autofluorescence despite their overlapping fluorescence spectra. Unmixing results are presented on figure 1 : non-specific <b>fluorescent</b> <b>markers</b> signal still remains in kidneys and everywhere else the marker has traveled, but autofluorescence has been removed. Ratio between skin and tumor has been noticeably increased. Comparable results have been obtained from two hours after injection, with only 5 nmol (200 µL) of marker: tumor localization was already sensibly improved. We found that in vivo spectrally resolved acquisition combined to NMF processing successfully filters fluorescence contributions of interest from measurements impaired by unwanted signals. Autofluorescence removal is a fundamental pre-processing step to get accurate FDOT reconstructions...|$|R
50|$|Around 1995, he {{commenced}} {{with the}} development of a light microscopic process, which achieved a substantially improved size resolution of cellular nanostructures stained with a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>marker.</b> This time he employed the principle of wide field microscopy combined with structured laser illumination (spatially modulated illumination, SMI) Currently, a size resolution of 30 - 40 nm (approximately 1/16 - 1/13 of the wavelength used) is being achieved. In addition, this technology is no longer subjected to the speed limitations of the focusing microscopy so that it becomes possible to undertake 3D analyses of whole cells within short observation times (at the moment around a few seconds). Disambiguation SMI: S = spatially, M = Modulated I= Illumination.|$|E
50|$|As {{well in the}} 1990s another super {{resolution}} microscopy method {{based on}} wide field microscopy has been developed. Substantially improved size resolution of cellular nanostructures stained with a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>marker</b> was achieved by development of SPDM localization microscopy and the structured laser illumination (spatially modulated illumination, SMI). Combining the principle of SPDM with SMI resulted {{in the development of}} the Vertico SMI microscope. Single molecule detection of normal blinking fluorescent dyes like Green fluorescent protein (GFP) can be achieved by using a further development of SPDM the so-called SPDMphymod technology which makes it possible to detect and count two different fluorescent molecule types at the molecular level (this technology is referred to as two-color localization microscopy or 2CLM).|$|E
50|$|The {{biomolecule}} (for instance double stranded DNA) {{bound to}} the biosurface {{can be used to}} tether a label free target in a label free interaction model. By applying a variable or alternating potential to the biosurface, the biomolecules can be moved systematically. In turn the movement can be measured in real time using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy of the fluorescence quenching of an attached <b>fluorescent</b> <b>marker</b> molecule. By analyzing the speed of the biomolecule as it is dragged through the buffer solution by the electric field, the binding of a ligand can be measured in real time. Since the speed of the biomolecule and a bound ligand depend on their hydrodynamic friction the method can be used to measure the size of the biomolecule and/or of the ligand. This can also be directly applied to detect conformational changes of the biomolecule and/or the ligand. It competes with technologies including surface plasmon resonance.|$|E

50|$|Ae. aegypti {{has been}} genetically {{modified}} to suppress its own species in an approach {{similar to the}} sterile insect technique, thereby {{reducing the risk of}} disease. The mosquitoes, known as OX513A, were developed by Oxitec, a spinout of Oxford University. Field trials in the Cayman Islands, Brazil, and Panama have shown that the OX513A mosquitoes reduced the target mosquito populations by more than 90%. This mosquito suppression effect is achieved by a self-limiting gene that prevents the offspring from surviving. Male modified mosquitoes, which do not bite or spread disease, are released to mate with the pest females. Their offspring inherit the self-limiting gene and die before reaching adulthood—before they can reproduce or spread disease. The OX513A mosquitoes and their offspring also carry a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>marker</b> for simple monitoring. To produce more OX513A mosquitoes for control projects, the self-limiting gene is switched off (using the Tet-Off system) in the mosquito production facility using an antidote (the antibiotic tetracycline), allowing the mosquitoes to reproduce naturally. In the environment, the antidote is unavailable to rescue mosquito reproduction, so the pest population is suppressed.|$|E
50|$|Concerning {{circulating}} tumor cells, maintrac {{is using}} an approach based on microscopic identification of circulating tumor cells. To prevent damage {{and loss of}} the cells during the process, maintrac uses just two steps towards the identification. In contrast to many other methods, maintrac does not purify the cells or enriches them, but identifies them {{within the context of}} the other blood compounds. To obtain vital cells and to reduce stress of those cells, blood cells are prepared by only one centrifugation step and erythrocyte lysis. Like CellSearch maintrac uses an EpCAM antibody. It is, however, not used for enrichment but rather as a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>marker</b> to identify those cells. Together with the nuclear staining with propidium iodide the maintrac method can distinguish between dead and living cells. Only vital, propidium excluding EpCAM positive cells are counted as potential tumor cells. Only living cells can grow into tumors, therefore dying EpCAM positive cells can do no harm. The suspension is analysed by fluorescence microscopy, which automatically counts the events. Simultaneous event galleries are recorded to verify whether the software found a true living cell and to differentiate between skin epithelial cells for example. Close validation of the method showed that additional antibodies of cytokeratins or CD45 did not have any advantage.|$|E

40|$|Provided {{that there}} is no {{chromatid}} interference, no movement of chiasmata, and no discrepancies between meiotic and mitotic chromosome lengths, then genetic maps and recombination fractions may be directly derived from our meiotic chiasma distribution data. This is illustrated by male chiasma derived genetic lengths and recombination fractions along chromosome 13. The recombination fraction between 13 p <b>fluorescent</b> <b>markers</b> and the proposed retinoblastoma locus at 13 q 14 is estimated at 0. 27 to 0. 37 and preliminary female chiasma studies suggest a recombination fraction of 0. 5 between these two sites. Therefore, it seems unlikely that 13 p <b>fluorescent</b> <b>markers</b> may be of any practical help in identifying retinoblastoma gene carriers. This is also borne out by the discordant segregation which has been found in six out of seven retinoblastoma families, which gives a calculated recombination fraction of 0. 39 (SE 0. 15), not significantly different from 0. 5...|$|R
