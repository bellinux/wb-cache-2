60|$|A few minutes' walk {{brought them}} {{to the foot of the}} hill where the <b>Indian</b> <b>tents</b> were pitched.

60|$|The lake {{on which}} the canoe was now launched, {{although}} not so large as Superior, was, nevertheless, a respectable body of water, {{on which the}} sun was shining as if on a shield of bright silver. There were numbers of small islets scattered over its surface; some thickly wooded to the water's edge, others little better than bare rocks. Crossing this lake they came to the mouth of a pretty large stream and began to ascend it. The first thing they saw on rounding a bend in the stream was an <b>Indian</b> <b>tent,</b> and in front of this <b>tent</b> was an <b>Indian</b> baby, hanging from the branch of a tree.|$|R
5000|$|Shamiana is {{a popular}} <b>Indian</b> {{ceremonial}} <b>tent</b> shelter or awning, commonly used for outdoor parties, marriages, feasts etc[...] Its side walls are removable.

60|$|Soon after, {{the storm}} burst {{with a degree}} of {{violence}} that the oldest hunter said he had never before witnessed. Lightning, wind, rain, thunder, seemed to have selected the spot for a battle-ground. Although the camp was pitched on comparatively high and rocky ground, the deluge was so great that in the course of ten minutes nearly everything was afloat. (See Note 1.) The camp was literally swimming, and some of the smaller children were with difficulty saved from drowning. So furious was the wind that the tents were either thrown down or blown to ribbons. During the storm three of the <b>Indian</b> <b>tents,</b> or lodges, were struck by lightning. In one of these a Canadian was killed; in another all the inmates--an Indian, his wife, two children, and two dogs--were killed, and a gun beside them was melted in several parts {{as though it had been}} lead.|$|R
60|$|Next {{night we}} {{slept in a}} shanty {{belonging}} to the timber-cutters {{on the coast of}} the gulf, which was truly the most wretched abode, except an <b>Indian</b> <b>tent,</b> I ever had the chance (or mischance) to sleep in. It was a small log-hut, with only one room; a low door--to enter which we had to stoop--and a solitary square window, filled with parchment in lieu of glass. The furniture was of the coarsest description, and certainly not too abundant. Everything was extremely dirty, and the close air was further adulterated with thick clouds of tobacco smoke, which curled from the pipes of half a dozen wood-choppers. Such was the place in which we passed the night; and glad was I when the first blush of day summoned us to resume our travels. We now entered our sleigh for the last time, and after a short drive arrived at the termination of the horse road. Here we got out, and rested a short time in a shanty, preparatory to taking to our snow-shoes.|$|R
50|$|The Winter Garden was {{commissioned}} by King Ludwig II of Bavaria (1864-1886) around 1870. After the king’s death, the Winter Garden {{on the roof of}} the Festsaalbau of the Residenz Palace was dismantled in 1897. The reason for this was due to water leaking from the ornamental lake through the ceiling of the rooms below. Photographs and sketches still record this incredible creation which included a grotto, a Moorish kiosk, an <b>Indian</b> royal <b>tent,</b> an artificially illuminated rainbow and intermittent moonlight.|$|R

60|$|There {{were two}} camps at a short {{distance}} from each other, that of the Heavy Camel Corps to which he now belonged, composed of men of the 1st and 2d Life Guards, Blues, Bays, 4th and 5th Dragoon Guards, Royals, Scots Greys, 5th and 16th Lancers. The other was the Guards Corps, composed of men of the three regiments of foot guards. Edgar's first feeling as he looked at the men who were standing about or lying {{in the shade of the}} little triangular <b>Indian</b> mountain-service <b>tents,</b> was that he had suddenly grown smaller. He was fully up to the average height of the men of his own regiment, but he felt small indeed by the side of the big men of the heavy cavalry regiments.|$|R

60|$|Finally {{comes the}} island nearest {{to the reader}} on the left. This also is wild and rocky, {{inhabited}} not by negroid blacks, but by <b>Indians,</b> whose <b>tents,</b> made by F. R. W. out of ordinary brown paper and adorned with chalk totems of a rude and characteristic kind, pour forth their fierce and well-armed inhabitants at the intimation of an invader. The rocks on this island, let me remark, have great mineral wealth. Among them {{are to be found}} not only sheets and veins of silver paper, but great nuggets of metal, obtained by the melting down of hopelessly broken soldiers in an iron spoon. Note, too, the peculiar and romantic shell beach of this country. It is an island of exceptional interest to the geologist and scientific explorer. The Indians, you observe, have domesticated one leaden and one wooden cow.|$|R
60|$|There were no tents: several green {{blankets}} {{that lay}} on the moss under the trees indicated where the party had lain during the night; and at a considerable distance apart from these sat Old Moggy, with her face buried in her skinny hands. Beside her stood Aneetka, with a calm but slightly anxious expression on her pale countenance. Chimo was held in a leash by an Indian. From {{the fact of the}} <b>Indians</b> being without <b>tents</b> or women, and having their faces daubed with red paint, besides being armed with knives, guns, and tomahawks, Maximus concluded that they composed a war party.|$|R
2500|$|Born in Kullavik, Sweden, Torsten Billman disliked school, {{with the}} drawing lessons {{as the only}} exception. During a drawing lesson with a {{substitute}} teacher Torsten had {{on a piece of}} blotting paper drawn a detailed composition, which was supposed to represent an <b>Indian</b> with his <b>tent</b> and utensils. [...] "After the teacher had inspected the pictures produced by the class, Torsten was called to his desk. He expected a sympathetic judgment from the teacher; yes, he also hoped that he might impress a certain girl in the class. So he stepped forward fearlessly. He had hardly reached the plattform when he received such a box on the ear that he fell to the floor. As he crestfallen rose to return to his own desk he was further rebuked by the teacher, who ordered him immediately to fling the drawing in the red-hot stove."

60|$|Not {{long after}} the sudden flight of the Esquimaux, the <b>Indians</b> struck their <b>tents</b> and took their {{departure}} for the interior, with the intention, as they said, of hunting for furs, but more probably, as Ma-istequan suggested, to hunt the deer. During all {{the time of their}} residence at the fort, Maximus had kept out of their way as much as possible. He seldom met them without a frown of hatred, for he regarded them as the representatives of a race which had robbed him of his bride; and there were times when the giant's spirit chafed so fearfully {{at the sight of the}} red men, that nothing but the remembrance of his promise to Stanley, to offer them no injury, prevented him from stirring up his tribe to overwhelm and destroy them. It was, therefore, with a feeling of relief that Maximus beheld them march single file over the rocky platform, and disappear in the ravine that led into the mountains.|$|R

50|$|Nancy {{lives with}} her parents and her wealthy cousin, Flora, who owns pretty things because her father is well off. One day, the two cousins go off to Indian ground and visit an <b>Indian</b> princess’ <b>tent.</b> Inside the tent were baskets and canoes for sell. One {{particular}} 50-cent sweet-grass basket catches the attention of the girls, and Flora expresses that she plans on buying the basket next week, after she receives her allowance from her father on Saturday. This stirs up jealousy in Nancy, who is determined to make the 50 cents and buy the basket before Flora. A few days later, Nancy is sent over to Aunt Lucretia’s on and errand. Nancy offers to pick berries for her aunt for a fee. Aunt Lucretia agrees to Nancy’s suggestion, offering her seven cents for each quart of blackberries. All week, Nancy worked hard picking blackberries, eventually earning the amount she needed to buy the basket. However, Aunt Lucretia did not have the change to pay her, and asked her to wait a few more days. The next day, Nancy again asked her aunt for money, but her Aunt still had not gotten change. On Saturday, Flora received her money but did not think of buying the basket. This spurred Nancy to go to Aunt Lucretia’s once again, to ask for her money. This time she went without permission. Although Lucretia was able to get her money, both her aunt and mother scolded her for her disobedience. The next day after church, Nancy told Flora she wanted to pick flowers, entreating Flora to head home first. Instead of picking flowers, Nancy ran to the Indian camp to buy the sweet-grass basket. When she returned home, her mother scolded her and made her take the basket back to the Indian princess. The princess refused to give back her money. Nancy obeyed her mother, leaving the money and the basket with the princess, but she remained sad, sobbing through supper. The next day, the Indian princess appeared at their door and returned the basket, which Nancy gave to Flora. Later on, Nancy was sent on another errand and the princess returned with more baskets. Flora bought an identical sweet-grass basket for Nancy and surprised Nancy with it.|$|R
