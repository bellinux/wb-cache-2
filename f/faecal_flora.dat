A total of 360 piglets (initial body weight 7. 14 ± 0. 63 kg) weaned at 26 ± 2 days of age were randomly allotted to 5 treatment groups (4 pens per treatment with 18 pigs per pen) for a 28 -day trial. Dietary treatments were basal diet without any antimicrobial (negative control; NC), basal diet supplemented with 120 mg/kg feed of neomycin sulfate (positive control; PC) and basal diet supplemented with 2 × 109 (L), 4 × 109 (M) and 20 × 109 (H) CFU/kg feed of B. subtilis KN- 42. During the overall period, average daily gain and feed efficiency of piglets were higher in groups PC, M, and H than those in group NC (p< 0. 05), and all probiotics and antibiotics groups had a lower diarrhea index than group NC (p< 0. 05). The 16 S rDNA gene-based methods were used to analyze <b>faecal</b> bacterial <b>flora</b> on day 28 of experiment. The result of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis showed that supplementation of B. subtilis KN- 42 to the diet changed the bacterial communities, with a higher bacterial diversity and band number in group M than in the other four groups.

40|$|THE factors {{affecting}} strains of Escherichia coli {{carried in the}} bowel of man are poorly understood.

40|$|SUMMARY Despite the {{extensive}} modifications of cows ' milk {{to make an}} infant formula resemble human breast milk, we showed in a previous study that the <b>faecal</b> <b>flora</b> of breast fed babies still differs substantially from that of formula fed babies. This paper describes the effects that differences {{in the distribution of}} whey proteins and caseins exert on the <b>faecal</b> <b>flora.</b> <b>Faecal</b> <b>flora</b> was examined in 33 babies receiving a whey formula, 29 babies receiving a casein formula, and 38 breast fed babies. Subsequently fewer babies in each group were studied at weeks 7, 11, and 15. More whey fed babies were colonised with bifidobacteria at 14 days compared with the casein fed group, more casein fed babies were colonised with bacteroides (at 14 days), and more had a dominant growth of enterococci (at week 7). It seems therefore that during the first two months that the whey predominant formula induced a <b>faecal</b> <b>flora</b> generally closer to that of breast fed babies than did a casein formula. In the preceeding paper it was shown that among breast fed babies bifidobacteria and staphylococci were the predominating organisms in the faeces whereas in bottle fed babies the predominating organisms were enterococci and Escherichia coli. 1 Breast milk differs from a modern infant formula in many ways so that the dietary cause(s) for these microbiological differences is (are) not clear. This present investigation was therefore designed {{to determine the effects of}} protein quality (in parti-cular the distribution of whey proteins and caseins) on the <b>faecal</b> <b>flora.</b> Few hospitals use a casein predominant formula but many mothers change their baby to a casein predominant one after some weeks and often following professional advice.

Nucleotides have been suggested as cofactors {{for the growth of}} bifidobacteria in vitro. Bifidobacteria are found to be more numerous in the faeces of breast fed babies compared with those of formula fed babies. <b>Faecal</b> <b>flora</b> were examined at 2 weeks of age in 32 babies who from birth had been fed a whey based formula supplemented with nucleotide monophosphate salts, 33 babies fed an unsupplemented formula, and 21 breast fed babies. <b>Faecal</b> <b>flora</b> were also examined at 4 weeks, and 7 weeks but with fewer babies in each group.

The counts of bifidobacteria and enterococci were reduced in the nucleotide supplemented group but bacteroides accounted for a higher percentage of the total flora in this group of babies.

40|$|The <b>faecal</b> <b>flora</b> {{of breast}} fed babies {{differs from that}} of bottle fed babies. We have shown that the use of a whey {{predominant}} formula rather than a casein predominant one induced a <b>faecal</b> <b>flora</b> generally closer to that of breast fed babies but substantial differences remained. The whey proteins of breast milk include much more lactoferrin than is found in cows' milk. Observations both in animals and in vitro suggest that lactoferrin could be responsible for some of these differences between bottle and breast fed babies. This study was designed to determine the effects on <b>faecal</b> <b>flora</b> of the addition of bovine lactoferrin to the diet of bottle fed babies while holding other qualities of their diet constant. As lactoferrin is an iron binding protein three test formulas were used: (a) no added iron and no added lactoferrin (basic), (b) no iron but added lactoferrin (L), and (c) added iron and lactoferrin (LF). The addition of lactoferrin had little effect upon the faecal microflora and did not move the pattern of the <b>faecal</b> <b>flora</b> {{in the direction of the}} breast fed baby. The addition of iron to the formula had more effect on the <b>faecal</b> <b>flora</b> than did lactoferrin. At day 4 it encouraged Escherichia coli and discouraged staphylococcal faecal colonisation.

40|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{knowledge}} on the composition and dynamics of the intestinal micro-eukaryotes of horse and to date their functional role for the health and physiology of the host has been described merely to some extent. Particularly, no culture-independent surveys of the dynamics of the intestinal fungal flora in horse are available. Two culture-independent approaches, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and cloning & sequencing, were combined to study the composition and dynamics of the intestinal fungal flora in healthy horses. The fungal internal transcribed regions (ITS) and the eukaryotic 18 S rRNA genes, recovered from faecal samples of 16 Swedish Standardbred geldings, were used as phylogenetic marker genes in the analyses. Faecal samples were analyzed by TRFLP and two clone libraries were constructed, one library for the 18 S gene and the other for the ITS gene from which later 44 random clones were sequenced. T-RFLP profiles and sequencing data together, indicate that the fungal community is temporally stable, has a low diversity and it is dominated by three genera of the Neocallimastigaceae family including Orpinomyces sp., Anaeromyces sp. and Piromyces species. These fungal species have been isolated and characterized previously in different types of herbivores including the Equidae family. These anaerobic fungi have been suggested to exist prevalently in the GI tract of large herbivores which in this aspect, there is no disparity between the data presented in this experiment and those from previous publications.

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1975 Dr. L. Valerie AscheThis study was made to ascertain the aetiology, origin and pathways of infection {{as well as the}} reason for recurrence of urinary tract infection in male patients with permanent indwelling catheter, at the Spinal Injuries Unit, Austin Hospital, Australia. There has been no detailed bacteriological report published since the Unit opened in 1956. Since urinary infections are frequent during the life of spinal paralytics, it is important in the management of such patients to determine whether it is relapse or re—infection which plays the major role of infection. The main body of this thesis presents the findings of a detailed search for wall—defective bacteria (L—forms) in an attempt to confirm or deny the hypothesis that persistent L—forms play a part in the repeated isolation of the same organism from a patient over a number of years. The aetiology of urinary infection occurring in new admissions was a reflection of the ward flora present at different times of survey, which in turn depended on the disinfection measures taken. Gram—negative, urea splitting organisms such as Klebsiella, Proteus, and Providence as well as the nosocomial bacteria Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Serratia were found to be more common in causing urinary infection than the traditional Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecalis. The chlorhexidine solution used for bladder irrigation was shown to be the source of Acinetobacter infections acquired during 1971 - 2 in new admissions. From weekly examinations during 1971 - 2 of new admissions there was little evidence that the urinary infections came from the patients' own <b>faecal</b> or nasal <b>flora</b> even when Klebsiella, Proteus or Pseudomonas were regularly isolated from such material.

40|$|The {{increasing}} resistance rate to {{antimicrobial agents}} is of global concern {{and needs to}} be readily addressed. Options for successful treatments of infectious diseases are becoming limited due to the spread of resistant strains and resistance genes in the clinic and in the community. The normal human microbiota, and especially the intestinal flora, is an important reservoir for the presence and transmission of resistance determinants. The Bacteroides fragilis group and Propionibacterium acnes are anaerobic opportunistic pathogens and members of the normal microbiota. Clinical isolates of these species are commonly resistant to a variety of antibiotics. Knowledge of the mechanisms behind the resistance is important for our understanding of its emergence, spread and persistence. It has also implications for the choice of antimicrobial therapy and the design of new drugs. In the present thesis, data on different aspects of antimicrobial resistance are presented. Bacteroides species are resistant to a number of antimicrobial agents. The resistance mechanisms against metronidazole, an important drug for the treatment of anaerobic infections, are still not sufficiently elucidated. We could demonstrate that nim genes are present in a sub-population of European clinical Bacteroides spp. strains and are significantly associated with reduced susceptibility to metronidazole. These strains could be induced to form a highly resistant sub-population. We detected a new variant of the nim gene as well as a variety of upstream regulatory elements. Patients with acne vulgaris are often heavily treated with antimicrobial agents creating a force for resistance development, which may also complicate the treatment of other infections. In the present study a number of known mechanisms behind erythromycin, clindamycin and tetracycline resistance in P. acnes isolates were characterised, but possibly newly evolved mechanisms were also involved. Different PFGE genotypes were shown to be distributed throughout Europe. Antimicrobial agents do not only affect the pathogens targeted but have also an impact on the normal microbiota. A 7 -day administration of clindamycin was shown to cause long-term disturbance in the <b>faecal</b> bacterial <b>flora</b> of healthy volunteers. This perturbation was recorded by analysing total faecal DNA and Bacteroides isolates from consecutively collected faecal samples. Molecular analysis of the faecal DNA revealed a shift in the Bacteroides community and enrichment of erm genes for up to two years following clindamycin exposure. Comparing these shifts with those in an unexposed control group where only minor changes in the bacterial community were recorded further strengthens the dramatic impact of the antimicrobial administration. The negative influence the clindamycin exposure had on the Bacteroides community was also demonstrated among the cultured isolates. An immediate decrease in species and clonal diversity was noted and there was a strong selection of resistant strains and resistance determinants, especially the clindamycin specific erm genes, lasting for up to two years. The long-term stabilisation of in vivo acquired erm genes was shown to be due to a restoration of bacterial fitness, confirmed by an in vitro competition assay of isogenic isolates collected 21 days and 18 months after initiated administration. The initial biological cost of acquiring an erm-gene was further confirmed in an in vitro acquired transconjugant. In conclusion, short-term antibiotic administration may cause decreased clonal diversity and persistent enrichment of resistant clones in the normal intestinal microbiota, creating a reservoir of resistance, further adding to the global burden of resistance...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY This study {{examined}} the <b>faecal</b> <b>flora</b> on days 4, 14, and 28 of 17 breast fed babies and 26 bottle fed babies receiving a modern infant formula based on demineralised whey. Generally among breast fed babies bifidobacteria and staphylococci were the predominant organisms, whereas in the formula fed babies the predominant organisms were enterococci, coliforms, and clostridia. Despite the extensive modification of cows ' milk to make an infant formula resemble human breast milk, the results {{are very similar to}} those previously reported with unmodified cows ' milk baby feeds. The exact dietary factor responsible for these microbiological differences is unclear and in succeeding papers we have looked at the effects of protein quality, in particular the content of whey proteins, casein, and lactoferrin. For many years it was accepted that the <b>faecal</b> <b>flora</b> of a breast fed baby differed from that of a bottle fed one. ' There are three reasons for re-examining this association between diet and <b>faecal</b> <b>flora</b> in the newborn. Firstly, many of these studies were per-formed using infant formulas that consisted of cows' milk with only minimal modification, whereas cows' milk is now extensively modified in the manufacture of an infant formula. 2 Secondly, breast milk differs from cows ' milk and cows ' milk based formula in so many ways {{it is impossible to know}} which dietary difference is responsible for the microbiological difference. Thirdly, some studies have not found these differences: the <b>faecal</b> <b>flora</b> of breast and bottle fed babies were similar. 3 4 It was suggested that the antiseptic environment of modern obstetrics may have over-ridden the dietary effects. For these reasons we have re-examined the association between diet and <b>faecal</b> <b>flora.</b> This first paper determines whether the faecal microflora of the breast fed baby differs from that of a bottle fed baby receiving a well defined modern infant formula and succeeding studies explore the effects of specific nutnents.

40|$|Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) is {{a condition}} where abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation, gas distension and/or variability in the bowel habit are experienced. It {{has been suggested that}} the gut microflora may be involved in this condition and that an 'abnormal' colonic fermentation may provoke the symptoms ofIBS. In this study, the <b>faecal</b> <b>flora</b> of 11. IBS patients was compared with that of 11 healthy individuals quantitatively using fluorescence in situ hylJridisation (FISH) andÃ‚Â· traditional plating techniques, as well as qualitatively using denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). It was found that IBS patients had lower total... / bacterial counts, bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, bacteroides and clostridia than seen in healthy individuals. DGGE also showed differences between illS and healthy samples, especially in relation to stability ofthe microflora over time. A synbiotic version ofLactobacillus plantarum NCIMB 41114 with seven different prebiotics was tested in batch culture fermenters using faecal samples from IBS donors. From all the combinations GOS-synbiotic was chosen sirc~ it enhanced the.. growth of the probiotic and was found to be more effective in 'normalising' the.. ~ <b>faecal</b> <b>flora</b> in IBS. This synbiotic combination was used in gut modelÃ‚Â· systems using faecal samples from donors belonging to different IDS subgroups. The results showed that administration of the synbiotic impacted the specific IBS subgroups [...] differently, but modulated the rnicroflora towards selective stimulation of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. In {{the last part of the}} study the amount of gas produced from IBS <b>faecal</b> <b>flora</b> during fermentation was compared to that ofhealthy <b>faecal</b> <b>flora.</b> The IDS flora produced more cumulative gas and had greater rates of production than the healthy flora. Administration of the synbiotic reduced gas production in all systems (IBS and healthy). Taken together, these observations help to define dietary management strategies, based on the gut flora and its activities, aimed towards improving IBS symptomology.

40|$|AbstractTo {{understand}} {{changes in}} the <b>faecal</b> <b>flora,</b> one has to know the physiological flora first. The aim {{of this paper is}} to give insight into the changes of the culturable <b>faecal</b> <b>flora</b> of European brown hares (Lepus europaeus) in a captive setting. Therefore faecal samples were collected from three juvenile hares as soon as possible after birth until their death, and from two adult female hares for almost one year. Samples were collected once a week and further processed as soon as possible. A routine bacteriological investigation was performed, as well as selective isolation of III. generation cephalosporin-resistant and fluoroquinolone-resistant enterobacterial isolates. The juvenile hares showed a somewhat more variable flora, the adult hares a rather stable composition. Only seldom potential pathogenic bacteria (i. e. Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens) were isolated from the adult hares. These pathogens were found after moments of stress. The more variable flora in the juveniles is seen as a result of the not yet completely developed immune system, and due to the stress of weaning. One juvenile showed a severe shift of the flora due to a severe typhlocolitis. Our results give insight into the normal <b>faecal</b> <b>flora</b> of European brown hares. These results can act as baseline information and help interpreting results gathered in a clinical setting, as well as during field work...|$|E
