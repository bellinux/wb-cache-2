40|$|The {{ability to}} {{integrate}} metal and semiconductor micro-systems to perform highly complex functions, such as RF-MEMS, {{will depend on}} developing freestanding metal structures that offer improved conductivity, reflectivity, and mechanical properties. Three issues have prevented the proliferation of these systems: (1) warpage of active components due to through-thickness stress gradients, (2) limited component lifetimes due to fatigue, and (3) low <b>yield</b> <b>strength.</b> To address these issues, we focus on developing and implementing techniques to enable the direct study of the stress and microstructural evolution during electrodeposition and mechanical loading. The study of stress during electrodeposition of metal thin films is being accomplished by integrating a multi-beam optical stress sensor into an electrodeposition chamber. By coupling the in-situ stress information with ex-situ microstructural analysis, a scientific understanding {{of the sources of}} stress during electrodeposition will be obtained. These results are providing a foundation upon which to develop a stress-gradient-free thin film directly applicable to the production of freestanding metal structures. The issues of <b>fatigue</b> and <b>yield</b> <b>strength</b> are being addressed by developing novel surface micromachined tensile and bend testers, by interferometry, and by TEM analysis. The MEMS tensile tester has a ''Bosch'' etched hole to allow for direct viewing of the microstructure in a TEM before, during, and after loading. This approach allows for the quantitative measurements of stress-strain relations while imaging dislocation motion, and determination of fracture nucleation in samples with well-known fatigue/strain histories. This technique facilitates the determination of the limits for classical deformation mechanisms and helps to formulate a new understanding of the mechanical response as the grain sizes are refined to a nanometer scale. Together, these studies will result in a science-based infrastructure to enhance the production of integrated metal [...] semiconductor systems and will directly impact RF MEMS and LIGA technologies at Sandia...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2006. Welded joints {{are major}} causes for {{concern in the}} {{engineering}} arena for two basic reasons. In the first instance the weld {{is known to be}} a region of weakness within a structure and is caused by residual and applied stress concentrations. Secondly, the behaviour of the stress patterns is somewhat difficult to predict accurately due to the difficulty of conforming to the geometry and process parameters. The experimental procedure in this work commenced with specimens being welded with a technique very commonly used in industry. The residual stresses generated by thermal fluctuations from the welding process cannot be predicted easily and is viewed as a problem as increased stress levels promotes failure. Residual stresses were then determined with the use of an ultrasonic stress measuring device. Strain gauges were used to measure strains in the welded specimens and these strains converted to stresses. The results of the two methods were compared and analysed. Compact tensile specimens were used to perform fatigue testing. The results confirmed findings from earlier research such as the proportion of cyclic life spent on initiating the crack. Hardness tests were performed to determine if any relationship existed between <b>fatigue</b> failure, <b>yield</b> <b>strength</b> and hardness. Finally metallurgical analysis revealed the phases and structures of the weld and heat-affected zones. The findings of this research indicate that close relationships exist between the cycles to crack initiation and ultimate fracture, the hardness, yield stress and the fatigue life of the weld as well as between the grain diameter and the yield stress. Furthermore it is shown that there was not enough information gathered in this research to conclude that the life expectancy of 300 WA welded steel can be predicted. However recommendations are made for future research in the prediction of failure of the 300 WA welded steel...|$|R
