40|$|Darwin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fox</b> (Pseudalopex fulvipes) {{is known}} to survive only on Chiloé Island {{off the coast of}} {{southern}} Chile and in Nahuelbuta National Park, 600 km to the north in mainland Chile. The Valdivian coastal forest, in which the Darwin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fox</b> lives, historically spanned from Nahuelbuta National Park southward past Chiloé Island on the mainland. Furthermore, the forest on Chiloé Island was connected to the mainland forest by a land bridge for much of the Pleistocene. Thus, the distribution of Valdivian forest suggests that the historic range of Darwin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fox</b> may have been much larger. We searched the remnant pockets of coastal forest on mainland Chile using live traps, non-invasive techniques and interviews to look for new populations of the critically endangered Darwin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fox.</b> Although no <b>Darwin</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fox</b> was captured, evidence of a new population near Punta Chanchán was found...|$|R

40|$|The {{story of}} how Charles Darwin {{composed}} The Origin of Species, published in November of 1859, has been told many times during the bicentennial of <b>Darwin</b> <b>s</b> birth and the sesquicentennial of {{the publication of the}} book. It is a history well known to biologists and historians of science. The heated debate that accompanied the demonstration of natural selection as a mechanism of speciation and continues to the present is surprising. Human beings do not welcome surprise: "the emotion aroused by something unexpected. " The history of science and human intellect, however, illustrate the creative stimulus of surprise and serendipity in the development of human knowledge and the evolution of culture. The lives of Homo sapiens would not change if our intellect was unable or unwilling to respond to the unexpected and to make connections between surprising and commonplace events. The rich diversity of South American life was surprising to the European travelers of the 18 th and 19 th centuries: surprising by its beauty and profusion, but also by its similarities to the creatures of Europe and Africa. <b>Darwin</b> <b>s</b> curiosity sought and welcomed surprise) ...|$|R
