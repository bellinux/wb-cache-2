40|$|The {{performance}} of promising genotypes of faba bean developed for areas with limited rainfall was {{compared with the}} local landrace, ILB 1814, at Tel Hadya in Syria during 1989 – 1988 using different row spacings and sowing densities. In {{the last two years}} of the trials the {{performance of}} the improved genotypes and ILB 1814 was compared with and without supplemental irrigation. Yields of ILB 1814 were better than the highest yielding genotypes in some years and similar to them in others. In seasons with limited rainfall the best yields were obtained by using a narrow row spacing and <b>dense</b> <b>sowing,</b> and yields were significantly improved by irrigation. Grain yield was correlated with biomass and the number of pods per unit area. The percentage of radiation intercepted was highest in ILB 1814, particularly when sown with a narrow row spacing and at a high plant density. Soil water extraction, evapotranspiration and water use efficiency were improved by sowing at a narrowrow spacing and high plant density...|$|E
40|$|Taraxacum brevicorniculatum {{produces}} high-quality {{natural rubber}} in its roots {{and could be}} developed as an alternative commercial source of this valuable raw material. However, current wild type accessions have a low biomass and branched roots that make them difficult to harvest. We set out to determine the optimum fertilizer and spacing requirements for T. brevicorniculatum plants in greenhouse and field trials, aiming to increase root biomass and reduce branching thus maximizing rubber yield and reducing losses during harvesting. Our preliminary data from greenhouse trials show that fertilizers containing calcium and magnesium in addition to NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) increase root biomass by 25 % compared to standard NPK fertilizer plus boron, and by 15 % compared to NPK plus calcium. Fertilizers with a low N:P ratio increased the root biomass in greenhouse and field trials. <b>Dense</b> <b>sowing</b> (5 - 10. cm between plants) inhibits root branching and leads to the f ormation of single taproots that can be harvested easily. We therefore provisionally recommend the application of low N:P ratio NPK fertilizer supplemented with calcium and magnesium to closely-spaced plants {{in order to achieve}} the greatest increase in plant biomass per hectare...|$|E
40|$|In Cameroon, {{seed cotton}} yields have not {{increased}} over the last 20 years because of the shortening of the rainy season and the worsening socioeconomic context. Farmers consequently often delay planting their crops. The main objective {{of this study was}} to investigate whether local indeterminate long-season cottons, grown at the recommended density, were more consistent with the farmers' current constraints than determinate short-season cultivars from Latin America that could be sown more densely. Wecarried out a 3 -year three-location survey in northern Cameroon, which included two planting dates (recommended and delayed) and two planting densities (recommended and high). We show that these three factors acted independently. Late planting had a highly negative impact on most traits at both plant and plot scale by delaying flowering, reducing seed cotton yield and fibre quality. <b>Dense</b> <b>sowing</b> mainly had an impact on individual plant traits by reducing boll retention and elongating main-stem internodes. Local cultivars have already evolved favourably (enhanced earliness, yield performance, harvest index, ginning out-turn, and fibre maturity) and could be improved further by crossing with highly determinate cottons. However, such a strategy requires further investigation to ensure that a more determinate growth pattern would not have a negative impact on the adaptive response of the traditional cotton plant to other adverse conditions.

40|$|Lodging, the {{permanent}} displacement of plant {{stems from the}} vertical, occurs on average once every four years in UK wheat crops, when it reduces the yield and bread making quality of grain. Lodging usually occurs {{in the summer and}} control is most commonly sought by applying growth retarding chemicals in the spring. This thesis develops a method of predicting which crops are prone to lodging so that spring lodging controls can be targeted most effectively. A model was developed in association with this study which calculates stem and root lodging risk from summer-time plant, weather and soil factors. The spread of the plant's root plate, the stem diameter and the number of shoots per plant were shown to have very strong influences on lodging. Structural rooting depth, stem failure yield stress, height at centre of gravity and the rate at which stems oscillate in wind (natural frequency) were also important, but less influential. Methods of predicting the most important lodging-associated plant characters from crop observations in spring were developed from the literature. These were then tested through experiments in 1995 and 1996 with factorial combinations of crops sown in late September and late October, at 500 seeds m- 2 and 250 seeds m- 2 and with large and small levels of residual soil nitrogen. Early <b>sowing,</b> <b>dense</b> seed rates and fertile soils all increased stem and root lodging, with sowing date having the greatest influence. Plants sown at high densities had small root plates and were poorly anchored; they also had fewer shoots causing a smaller leverage. Early sown plants had shoots with a high centre of gravity and slow natural frequency, causing a greater leverage. Plants sown early on fertile soils had narrow, weak stems. Final shoot number per plant was predicted with good precision (R 2 = 094) from spring plant number m- 2 and maximum shoot number m- 2 using a model of tiller survival. Stem diameter was predicted with moderate precision (R 2 = 057) from spring canopy size and shoot number m- 2, via a calculation of the amount of dry matter partitioned to each stem base. Root plate spread showed a linear and inverse relationship to spring plant density (R 2 = 0. 48), mainly as a result of variation in the length of the rigid roots and in the width of the plant base. It is concluded that early season crop observations have the potential to predict the values of the most influential lodging-associated plant characters, from which a model of lodging can calculate the proneness of crops to stem or root lodging in time for remedial action. The next steps would be to develop prediction schemes for other plant characters which influence lodging and test all the predictions in a wider range of crops, sites and seasons...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to understand the effects of plant spacing on grain yield and root competition in summer maize (Zea mays L.). Maize cultivar Denghai 661 was planted in rectangular tanks (0. 54 m× 0. 27 m× 1. 00 m) under 27 cm (normal) and 6 cm (narrow) plant spacing and treated with zero and 7. 5 g nitrogen (N) per plant. Compared to normal plant spacing, narrow plant spacing generated less root biomass in the 0 – 20 cm zone under both N rates, slight reductions of dry root weight in the 20 – 40 cm and 40 – 70 cm zones at the mid-grain filling stage, and slight variation of dry root weights in the 70 – 100 cm zone during the whole growth period. Narrow plant spacing decreased root reductive activity in all root zones, especially at the grain-filling stage. Grain yield and above-ground biomass were 5. 0 % and 8. 4 % lower in the narrow plant spacing than with normal plant spacing, although narrow plant spacing significantly increased N harvest index and N use efficiency in both grain yield and biomass, and higher N translocation rates from vegetative organs. These results indicate that the reductive activity of maize roots in all soil layers and dry weights of shallow roots were significantly decreased under narrow plant spacing conditions, resulting in lower root biomass and yield reduction at maturity. Therefore, a moderately <b>dense</b> <b>sowing</b> is a basis for high yield in summer maize...|$|E
