5|$|This sturdily built {{antelope}} has {{a yellow}} to grayish brown coat. Generally, the bohor reedbuck is yellower than other reedbucks. The large and diffuse sebaceous glands {{present on the}} coat make the coat greasy {{and give it a}} strong odour. Juveniles are darker than the adults as well as long-haired. While R. r. bohor appears yellowish gray, R. r. wardi is richly tinted. The undersides are white in color. A few distinct markings can be observed—such as a dark stripe on the front of each foreleg; white markings under the tail; and a pale ring of hair around the eyes and along the lips, lower jaw, and upper throat. <b>However,</b> <b>R.</b> r. redunca lacks dark stripes on its forelegs. The males have thicker necks. Its large, oval-shaped ears distinguish it from other antelopes. There is a round bare spot below each ear. Apart from sebaceous glands, bohor reedbuck have a pair of inguinal glands and vestigial foot glands, and four nipples. A bohor reedbuck can survive for at least ten years. The tracks of the bohor reedbuck are slightly smaller than those of the southern reedbuck.|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} the Greek word is unclear. It is {{sometimes}} held {{to be from the}} Tamil word (arisi), or rather Old Tamil arici. However, Krishnamurti disagrees with the notion that Old Tamil arici {{is the source of the}} Greek term, and proposes that it was borrowed from descendants of Proto-Dravidian *wariñci instead. Mayrhofer suggests that the immediate source of the Greek word is to be sought in Old Iranian words of the types *vrīz- or *vrinj- (Source of the modern Persian word Berenj), but these are ultimately traced back to Indo-Aryan (as in Sanskrit vrīhí-). P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar assumed that the Sanskrit vrīhí- is derived from the Tamil arici, while Ferdinand Kittel derived it from the Dravidian root variki. <b>However,</b> <b>R.</b> Swaminatha Aiyar believes that the Sanskrit vrīhí- is derived from a Proto-Indo-Iranian root, and the Old Tamil arici is also of Indo-European origin.|$|E

25|$|Kargil War: R {{was heavily}} criticised in 1999, {{following}} the Pakistani incursions at Kargil. Critics accused R {{of failing to}} provide intelligence that could have prevented the ensuing ten-week conflict that brought India and Pakistan {{to the brink of}} a full-scale war. While the Army has been critical of the information they received R has pointed the finger at the politicians, claiming they had provided all the necessary information. <b>However,</b> <b>R</b> was successful in intercepting a telephonic conversation between Pervez Musharraf, the then Pakistan Army Chief who was in Beijing and his chief of staff Lt. Gen. Mohammed Aziz in Islamabad. This tape was later published by India to prove Pakistani involvement in the Kargil incursion. In 2011, a think tank report stated that RAW had warned in its October 1998 assessment that Pakistan Army might launch a limited swift offensive with possible support of alliance partners, however the government ignored such reports.|$|E
500|$|<b>However,</b> <b>R.</b> A. Dunlap {{points out}} the {{contrast}} between the order of the polyhedral forms and the more chaotic biological nature of the chameleons inhabiting them. In the same vein, Beech observes that the stars themselves convey tension between order and chaos: despite their symmetric shapes, the stars are scattered apparently at random, and vary haphazardly from each other. [...] As Escher himself wrote about the central chameleon cage, [...] "I shouldn't be surprised if it wobbles a bit." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 19, 2006, Yankovic {{began working}} on the album's parodies. During these sessions, three parodies were recorded; the first of these, [...] "Canadian Idiot", is a play on [...] "American Idiot" [...] by Green Day. It is a satirical {{commentary}} on American nationalism and the stereotypical American view of Canadians. The song is ironic, and Yankovic has stated that the song's anger is a joke and that he loves Canada. Next, Yankovic {{began working on}} [...] "Trapped in the Drive-Thru", a parody of R. Kelly's [...] "Trapped in the Closet". Yankovic was inspired to pen the spoof after hearing the [...] "brilliant and wonderful and ridiculous" [...] original. Efforts to make the parody more convoluted than the original were first considered but then abandoned by Yankovic; he eventually reasoned, however, {{that he could make}} his version [...] "a little more stupid". Thus, the song is an excruciatingly detailed narrative about a couple getting hamburgers at the drive-thru, which was [...] "the most banal thing [...] could think of at the time." [...] Because the song was three times the length of a normal song, legally, Yankovic would have been required to pay thrice the statutory rate for royalties. This in turn would have forced Yankovic to remove one of his parodies from the album. <b>However,</b> <b>R.</b> Kelly allowed Yankovic to only pay the royalty rate for one song. To round out the first session, Yankovic recorded [...] "Confessions Part III", a play on [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] by Usher. The song purports to be a continuation of the Usher songs [...] "Confessions" [...] and [...] "Confessions Part II", focusing on trivial, silly, strange, and disturbing confessions; Yankovic explained that, [...] "After hearing Usher do , I couldn’t help but think that maybe he’d left a few things out, that there were a few confessions he had yet to make." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>However,</b> <b>R.</b> Graczyk {{claims in}} his A Grammar of Crow (2007) that [...] "nlike many other native {{languages}} of North America in general, {{and the northern}} plain in particular, the Crow language still exhibits considerable vitality: there are fluent speakers of all ages, and at least some children are still acquiring Crow as their first language." [...] Many of the younger population who do not speak Crow are able to understand it. Almost {{all of those who}} do speak Crow are also bilingual in English. [...] Graczyk cites the reservation community as the reason for both the high level of bilingual Crow-English speakers and the continued use and prevalence of the Crow language. Daily contact with non-American Indians on the reservation for over one hundred years has led to high usage of English. Traditional culture within the community, however, has preserved the language via religious ceremonies and the traditional clan system.|$|E
