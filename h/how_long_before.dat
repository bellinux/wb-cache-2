"At Tregarden lived John de Tregarthyn, temp Edward I, <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>before</b> I know not, {{after which}} his posterity {{in this place}} married with the great inheritrixes of Pever, Chamberlayne and Hendower, of Court, in Branell, by which last, by the Cornwalls of that place, they were {{lineally}} descended from Richard, Earl of Cornwall, King of the Romans, by his concubine Joan de Valletort, widow of Sir Alexander Oakeston".|$|E
2500|$|Early in his reign, Antipas {{had married}} the {{daughter}} of King Aretas IV of Nabatea. However, {{on a visit to}} Rome he stayed with his half-brother Herod II and there fell in love with his wife, Herodias, (granddaughter of Herod the Great and Mariamne I), and the two agreed to marry, after Herod Antipas had divorced his wife. Aretas' daughter learned of the plan and asked permission to travel to the frontier fortress of Machaerus, whence Nabatean forces escorted her to her father. With his daughter now safe in his custody, Aretas now could declare war on Herod. It is generally agreed that the war, in which Herod was defeated, occurred in 36, a year before the death of the emperor Tiberius. A point of contention today is <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>before</b> this date Herod's marriage to Herodias took place. Some surmise that the marriage of Antipas and Herodias took place shortly before the war in about the year 34, after the death of Philip, but others have pointed to Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews Book 18, chapter 5, paragraph 4 comment that Herodias [...] "divorced herself from her husband while he was alive" [...] to argue that it took place before Herod II's death, in about the year 27, thus making it possible for Jesus to have been born in the reign of Herod the Great (as indicated by the Gospel of Matthew) and to have died in his early 30's (as indicated by the Gospel of Luke).|$|E
