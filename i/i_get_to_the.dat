5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know if I was going to be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E

They have recorded songs for six studio albums and an extended play (EP), {{as well as}} various other releases. The two formed the band after working on their rendition of Richard and Linda Thompson's [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Border", which included on the soundtrack of Martin Hynes's 2007 film The Go-Getter and was used during its closing credits. Described as [...] "a collection of vintage-sounding country-tinged songs", their debut album Volume One, released under indie label Merge Records in 2008. Deschanel wrote all of the album's original tracks, except [...] "Sweet Darlin'", which she co-wrote with Jason Schwartzman.|$|E

500|$|Darla {{is first}} {{killed in the}} seventh episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In that episode, it is {{revealed}} that Darla was once romantically involved with Angel and that she made him a vampire. Angel stakes her through the heart. Benz was asked {{to return to the}} role three years later, but not on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Joss Whedon wanted her to appear on the spin-off Angel, which focused on Angel's adventures in Los Angeles. Benz said in an interview: I was shocked, really. When they sent me the script [...] I kept asking, 'Where's Darla?' I remember calling my agent asking, 'Are you sure they want me for this episode because I can't seem to find me?' And then <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last page and there I am... naked in a box. Awesome. It was exciting.|$|E
500|$|The Governor of Queensland, Sir Colin Hannah, gave {{a speech}} denigrating the Whitlam Government on 15 October, in {{violation}} of the convention that state governors remain neutral. Hannah held a dormant commission as Administrator of the Commonwealth to act as Governor-General in the event of Kerr's death, resignation, or absence from Australia. Whitlam immediately contacted Buckingham Palace to arrange for Hannah's dormant commission to be revoked, a process which took ten days to complete. Although Whitlam later alleged that he never contemplated dismissing Kerr during the crisis, on 16October, while speaking with Kerr and visiting Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak, he told Kerr that if the crisis continued, [...] "It could be a question of whether <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Queen first for your recall, or whether you get in first with my dismissal". Kerr saw the statement as a threat; Whitlam later stated the comment was [...] "flippant" [...] and designed to turn the conversation to another subject.|$|E
500|$|He {{also used}} [...] "A Mighty Fortress Is Our God" [...] by novelty singer Corn Mo at {{the insistence of}} Nick Offerman, who plays three minor roles in the film. The Portland Youth Jazz Orchestra All Stars plays Ward's [...] "One Life Away" [...] as an [...] "old-timey instrumental" [...] for one of Mercer's dreams, an homage to a dancing {{sequence}} seen in Jean-Luc Godard's 1964 film Bande Ã  part. For the closing credits, Ward and Zooey Deschanel recorded a duet cover of [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Border" [...] from Richard and Linda Thompson's 1974 album I Want to See the Bright Lights Tonight. The pair found themselves [...] "mutually charmed", according to The New York Times Melena Ryzik, and bonded over similar musical interests. After Ward listened to Deschanel's demos, they paired up and formed the band She & Him. Pitchfork Media reported in April 2007 of a future The Go-Getter soundtrack to be released by Merge Records, including a 12-song tracklist, but Merge later claimed that it was never planning to release a soundtrack.|$|E

500|$|Singapore was a {{critical}} race in the championship as all five drivers {{had a chance to}} take the lead with a victory. The situation was made difficult for Alonso as he had used his allocation of eight engines following the Italian Grand Prix, and to replace one would incur a ten-place grid penalty. His rivals each had at least one untouched engine in reserve; Webber had two. Nevertheless, Alonso set himself the target to score points in Singapore. He also acknowledged that his car was not the fastest in the field and felt he needed five podiums in the season's five remaining races. Webber stated that he was expecting Singapore to be a tough weekend for him after he had retired from the event in 2008 and 2009, but felt there was still some time before a driver clinched the championship. [...] After crashing out of the first lap of the Italian Grand Prix, Hamilton said he would push hard to stay in the running for the championship: [...] "I'll take each race as it comes, but I'll also be making sure <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> finish of the next five races, that's more important than anything. I go to Singapore to win." [...] Hamilton felt Alonso was the favourite to win the Singapore Grand Prix and viewed the Spanish driver as his main rival for the Drivers' Championship which was shared by Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. Button himself believed Alonso would have an extra advantage as the Spaniard's teammate Massa was out of contention for the title.|$|E

I don't start painting until I have it all worked out in my mind. I'm all right when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> easel". He often made preparatory sketches to work out his carefully calculated compositions. He and his wife kept a detailed ledger of their works noting such items as [...] "sad face of woman unlit", [...] "electric light from ceiling", and [...] "thighs cooler".|$|E
