5|$|The {{years of}} {{retirement}} in the Adams' household were {{not without some}} temporary financial adversity; in 1803 the bank holding his cash reserves of about $13,000 collapsed. <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> {{came to the rescue}} by purchasing from him his properties in Weymouth and Quincy, including Peacefield, for the sum of $12,800.|$|E
50|$|John McIver was a {{powerful}} crime boss, criminal financier and organizer, and the brother of Quincy McIver. As a teenager, <b>John</b> and <b>Quincy</b> grew up on an unidentified island in the Caribbean Sea. Unlike <b>Quincy,</b> <b>John</b> was quick and savvy enough {{to stay out of}} trouble despite stealing from the local merchants. After John found out that Quincy blurted out that they were brothers to a shopkeeper who had caught him, <b>John</b> gave <b>Quincy</b> a beating. A few nights later, John beat the shopkeeper to death. Years later, John was in the employ of Herve Argosy where he worked as his muscle man in his gun-extorting business. <b>John</b> got <b>Quincy</b> in with Herve Argosy, but Quincy got all four limbs chopped off by a motorboat propeller on the first mission. <b>John</b> visited <b>Quincy</b> in the hospital to mock his misfortune. John McIver then took on the name John Bushmaster and headed off to Europe to run some of Argosy's trade there.|$|R

The {{edition of}} 1811 was issued {{as a new}} edition of <b>John</b> <b>Quincy's</b> Lexicon Medicum, a work which had gone through thirteen editions, largely copied by Hooper. Subsequent editions bore the title Lexicon Medicum, or Medical Dictionary, without reference to Quincy.|$|R
5|$|When Mexico won its {{independence}} from Spain in 1821, the United States did not contest the new republic's claims to Texas, and both presidents <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> Adams (1825–1829) and Andrew Jackson (1829–1837) persistently sought, through official and unofficial channels, to procure all or portions of provincial Texas from the Mexican government, without success.|$|E
5|$|As president, <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> Adams had {{previously}} disallowed {{trade between the}} United States and West Indies during his tenure. However, following {{the passage of the}} 1827 hurricane, the politician allowed free trade for three months. Presidential candidate Andrew Jackson soon became outspoken against cutting ties between the two regions, and his support for free trade garnered support from shipping interests that helped him win the presidency a year later.|$|E
5|$|Most Native Americans in {{the region}} decided against joining the uprising, and so the {{conflict}} ended after U.S. officials responded with a show of military force. Ho-Chunk chiefs surrendered eight men {{who had participated in}} the violence, including Red Bird, who American officials believed to be the ringleader. Red Bird died in prison in 1828 while awaiting trial; two other men convicted of murder were pardoned by President <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> Adams and released.|$|E

5|$|On November 3, 1828, President <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> Adams, {{having been}} told that the executions would likely spark another uprising, pardoned the prisoners in {{exchange}} for a land cession. In July and August 1829, in treaties signed at Prairie du Chien, the Three Fires Confederacy and the Ho-Chunks formally ceded the lead mining region to the United States for annual payments of $16,000 and $18,000 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Adams joined Franklin and Arthur Lee in 1778 as a {{commissioner}} to France, replacing Silas Deane. He sailed for France {{with his}} 10-year-old son <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> aboard the frigate Boston early that year. The stormy trip was treacherous, with lightning injuring 19 sailors and killing one. Adams' ship was later pursued by several British frigates in the mid-Atlantic, but evaded them. Near {{the coast of}} Spain, Adams himself took up arms to help capture a heavily armed British merchantman ship, the Martha. Later, a cannon malfunction killed one and injured five more of the crew before the ship arrived in France.|$|E
5|$|As of 30 June 1854, {{the crew}} of Albany {{consisted}} of 18 officers, 156 seaman, and 23 Marines. It is likely the ship's complement was little changed when she was lost three months later. The crew included several sons and grandsons of prominent men: Commander James T. Gerry, youngest son of Elbridge Gerry, formerly Vice President of the United States, Lieutenant <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> Adams, grandson of the second president and nephew of the sixth, and Midshipman Bennet Israel Riley, son of Brevet General Bennet C.

5|$|Daughter Abigail ("Nabby") {{was married}} to Representative William Stephens Smith, but she {{returned}} to her parents' home after the failure of the marriage; she died of breast cancer in 1813. His wife Abigail died of typhoid on October 28, 1818. His son Thomas and wife Ann, along with seven children, lived with Adams to the end of Adams' life, as well as Louisa Smith (Abigail's niece by her brother William). Sixteen months before John Adams' death, <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> became the sixth president of the United States in 1825, the only son to succeed his father as President until George W. Bush in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Gore's {{windfall}} was realized when in 1790 the United States Congress, {{acting on}} a proposal made by Alexander Hamilton and supported by Gore's friend Rufus King, passed legislation that exchanged Continental and state paper for new U.S. paper at face value. Not only did Gore win on this exchange, but the paper he received appreciated in value before he sold it. The exact amount he made is unclear from the surviving documents: <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> Adams wrote that Gore's speculations made him the wealthiest lawyer in the country.|$|E
5|$|In 1800, Adams lost {{re-election}} to Thomas Jefferson {{and retired}} to Massachusetts. He eventually resumed {{his friendship with}} Jefferson upon the latter's own retirement by initiating a correspondence which lasted fourteen years. He and his wife established a family of politicians, diplomats, and historians now {{referred to as the}} Adams political family. Adams was the father of <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> Adams, the sixth President of the United States. He died on the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, and the same day as Jefferson. Modern historians in the aggregate have favorably ranked his administration.|$|E

5|$|Lame duck {{president}} <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> Adams nominated Crittenden to the U.S. Supreme Court on December 17, 1828 but Senators {{who supported}} president-elect Jackson voted to postpone confirmation until Jackson could nominate his own man. After his brief service as Kentucky Secretary of State, {{the state legislature}} elected Crittenden to the second of his four non-consecutive stints in the U.S. Senate. Upon his election as president, William Henry Harrison appointed Crittenden as Attorney General, but 5 months after Harrison's death, political differences prompted him to resign rather than continue his service under Harrison's successor, John Tyler.|$|E
5|$|Letcher's {{family came}} to Kentucky around 1800. Letcher {{attended}} the private academy of Joshua Fry, then studied law.

In 1823, {{he was elected to}} the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served for more than a decade. During the 1824 presidential election, he acted as an intermediary between <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> Adams and Henry Clay. Adams' opponent, Andrew Jackson, charged that, through these negotiations, Clay agreed to support Adams for president in exchange for being named Secretary of State.|$|E

As a young man, Prescott frequented the Boston Athenæum, which at the time held the 10,000-volume private library of <b>John</b> <b>Quincy</b> Adams, who was on a diplomatic mission to Russia. In 1832, Prescott became a trustee of the library, a position he held for 15years.|$|E

5|$|With {{the roads}} {{becoming}} impassable, Lafayette stayed in Washington City {{for the winter}} of 1824–25, and thus {{was there for the}} climax of the hotly contested 1824 election, in which no presidential candidate was able to secure a majority of the Electoral College, throwing the decision to the House of Representatives.
