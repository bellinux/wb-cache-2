5|$|Byers, Rechlicz, Stoa, Syner and Wellar {{were all}} re-signed for the 2013–14 season, and Deschamps and LeBlanc {{received}} qualifying offers from the Washington Capitals. It was announced June 14 that Taffe re-signed with the Bears. The Swedish Hockey League had announced one month earlier that Taffe {{had signed a}} contract with them, but Taffe said that announcement had been premature, and <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his family in North America. In July, the Bears signed four free agents to one-year contracts: defenseman Tyson Strachan, winger Matt Watkins, forward Derek Whitmore and goaltender David Leggio. For the 2013–14 season, Hershey signed defenseman David Kolomatis, Nate Schmidt, and Jaynen Rissling, as well as goaltender Riley Gill, and forwards Josh Brittain, Dustin Gazley, Brandon Segal, and Jamie Johnson, a former linemate of Taffe's with the Rochester Americans.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes instead {{started to}} train with A.F.C. Sudbury and {{played in a}} {{pre-season}} friendly against Bury Town, during which he scored to help Sudbury win 4–3. However, although Rhodes {{said he would like}} to join the semi-professional Isthmian League Division One North side, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his options open in case he could remain in the professional game. A week later, he was given a trial with League Two Hereford United. Instead, the following week, Rhodes signed for Isthmian League Premier Division side Canvey Island and immediately went into the first-team to make his debut on 28 August in a home league match against Carshalton Athletic, which finished 1–1, with Rhodes close to scoring what would have been a late winning goal for his new club. Rhodes' first goals for Canvey Island came in a FA Cup first round qualifying match against Newport Pagnell Town, scoring twice in a 4–1 victory. He scored again in the next round to put Canvey into the third qualifying round. Rhodes signed a contract to keep him with the club until the end of the season and scored two more in Canvey's ultimate exit from the FA Cup.|$|E
5|$|Warren Davis, a {{programmer}} hired {{to work on}} the action game Protector, noticed Lee's ideas, and asked if he could use them to practice programming randomness and gravity as game mechanic. Thus, he added balls that bounced from the pyramid's top to bottom. Because Davis was still learning how to program game mechanics, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the design simple. He also felt games with complex control schemes were frustrating and wanted something that could be played with one hand. To accomplish this, Davis removed the shooting and changed the objective to saving the protagonist from danger. As Davis worked on the game one night, Gottlieb's vice president of engineering, Ron Waxman, noticed him and suggested to change the color of the cubes after the game's character has landed on them. Davis implemented a unique control scheme; a four-way joystick was rotated 45° to match the directions of Q*bert's jumping. Staff members at Gottlieb urged for a more conventional orientation, but Davis stuck to his decision. Davis remembered to have started programming in April 1982, but the project was only put on schedule as an actual product several months later.|$|E

He could also not afford to show any weakness if <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the loyalty of the already subdued Indian princes. Porus had to defend his kingdom and chose the perfect spot to check Alexander's advance. Although he lost the battle, he became the most successful recorded opponent of Alexander. According to Peter Green, King Porus's performance in the battled out-classed both Memnon of Rhodes and Spitamenes.|$|E

Also, while RM 33 was still potentially operable, RM 35 had been involved in an accident during its last months of service, and its frame was bent {{in such a way that}} would have prevented it from running again; even if it was feasible to repair the damage, it would have been beyond John's means to repair it or pay for it to be repaired.|$|E
25|$|During Richardson's life, his {{printing}} press produced about 10,000 pieces, including novels, historical texts, Acts of Parliament, and newspapers, making his print house {{one of the}} most productive and diverse in the eighteenth century. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the press in his family, but {{after the death of his}} four sons and a nephew, his {{printing press}} would be left in his will to his only surviving male heir, a second nephew. This happened to be a nephew whom Richardson did not trust; he doubted the younger man's abilities as a printer. Richardson's fears proved well-founded, for after his death the press stopped producing quality works and eventually stopped printing altogether. Richardson owned copyrights to most of his works, and these were sold after his death. They were sold in twenty-fourth shares, with shares in Clarissa bringing in 25 pounds each and those for Grandison bringing in 20 pounds each. Shares in Pamela, sold in sixteenths, went for 18 pounds each.|$|E

Ethan begins to realize his feelings for Silver, {{which leads to a}} confrontation with Dixon and a kiss with Silver. At Naomi and Jen's (her sister) after-prom party, Liam sleeps with Jen. He is mad that Naomi told Jen about his past: <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it a secret. However, he was not aware that Jen was Naomi's sister, and upon finding out is horrified. Naomi finds out about it but thinks that Annie was with Liam, not Jen. This culminates in a major fight between Annie and Naomi where Annie is shunned by her peers, runs away, gets in her car drunk and accidentally runs over a man. This is a suspenseful way to end the season and definitely brings plot twist seeing that Annie is not sure whether or not this man survived.|$|E

Narayan played with the classical singers Omkarnath Thakur, Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Hirabai Badodekar, and Krishnarao Shankar Pandit, and he accompanied singer Amir Khan in 1948, when Khan sang {{for the first time}} at AIR Delhi following {{the partition}}. As an accompanist for vocalists, Narayan showed his own talent and came to the foreground. Singers of the city complained that he was not a dependable accompanist and too assertive, but he maintained <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> vocalists in tune and inspire them in a cordial contest.

500|$|Warwick Davis played Filius Flitwick in {{the first}} two films as an old dwarf-like man with gray hair. In {{pre-production}} for the third film, the producers told Davis there was no role for Flitwick, but {{that they would like to}} have him play somebody else, at least for a cameo. Davis played a much younger-looking man with black hair and a moustache who directed the choir at the Hogwarts Welcome Feast, and was credited as portraying [...] "Wizard". During pre-production for the fourth film, director Mike Newell told Davis <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his look from the last film but make this the new look for Flitwick. Davis now considers the character he has played some relative of Flitwick, though he is still credited as [...] "Filius Flitwick".

500|$|Injustice: Gods Among Us {{was first}} {{announced}} on May 31, 2012. According to Ed Boon, {{the main goal}} heading into Injustice {{was to create a}} game outside of the Mortal Kombat series that was dramatically different within the fighting game genre. Producer Hector Sanchez stated that NetherRealm Studios did not feel constrained by the parameters of Mortal Kombat, allowing the developers to take more design risks with Injustice, such as removing Mortal Kombats traditional dedicated block button. Similar to Boon's previous DC-related title, Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, the use of the DC Comics license implied restrictions to the amount of violence in the game; however, Boon intended to push the [...] "Teen" [...] rating by replacing violence with [...] "crazy, over-the-top action." [...] When questioned if the studio's past experience with Mortal Kombat and its characteristic violence would influence Injustice, Boon replied that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the two titles as separate entities.|$|E

500|$|Kubrick would devote his {{personal}} breaks to having lengthy discussions with actors. Among those who valued his attention was Tony Curtis, star of Spartacus, who said Kubrick {{was his favorite}} director, adding, [...] "his greatest effectiveness was his one-on-one relationship with actors." [...] He further added, [...] "Kubrick had his own approach to film-making. He {{wanted to see the}} actor's faces. He didn't want cameras always in a wide shot twenty-five feet away, he wanted close-ups, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the camera moving. That was his style." [...] Similarly, Malcolm McDowell recalls the long discussions he had with Kubrick to help him develop his character in A Clockwork Orange, noting that on set he felt entirely uninhibited and free, which is what made Kubrick [...] "such a great director". Kubrick also allowed actors at times to improvise and to [...] "break the rules", particularly with Peter Sellers in Lolita, which became a turning point in his career as it allowed him to work creatively during the shooting, as opposed to the preproduction stage.|$|E

500|$|During Benefica's season-ending North American tour {{after the}} last game of 2006–07, Fernando Santos spoke to the media about {{his plans for the}} {{upcoming}} season. As promised by club president Luís Filipe Vieira, the club would spend more on new players to build a team capable of winning the title. Simão was crucial; according to Santos, [...] "I cannot see myself without Simão". In addition, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Fabrizio Miccoli and sign a new striker who could be a target man. The club's first addition was winger Fábio Coentrão in March, followed by defenders Marco Zoro and David Luiz in May; the latter signed a five-year contract after performing well on loan. In June, Benfica began their promised investments, spending over €9 million on Óscar Cardozo from Newell's Old Boys and a reported €2.5 million on Gonzalo Bergessio. Both added options to an offence composed solely of Nuno Gomes and Mantorras, since Fabrizio Miccoli and Derlei did not renew their loan agreements. Breaking with tradition, Benfica did not tour abroad; they remained at the club's new training center, Futebol Campus. Santos also decided not to participate in the Teresa Herrera Trophy, since the tournament was too close to Benefica's first league match.|$|E
