40|$|A {{magnetic}} bearing for passively suspending a rotatable element subjected to axial and radial thrust forces is disclosed. The {{magnetic bearing}} employs a taut wire stretched along the longitudinal {{axis of the}} bearing between opposed <b>end</b> <b>pieces</b> and an intermediate magnetic section. The intermediate section is segmented to provide oppositely directed magnetic flux paths between the <b>end</b> <b>pieces</b> and may include either an axially polarized magnets interposed between the segments. The <b>end</b> <b>pieces,</b> separated from the intermediate section by air gaps, control distribution of magnetic flux between the intermediate section segments. Coaxial alignment of the <b>end</b> <b>pieces</b> with the intermediate section minimizes magnetic reluctance in the flux paths endowing the bearing with self-centering characteristics when subjected to radial loads. In an alternative embodiment, pairs of oppositely wound armature coils are concentrically interposed between segments of the intermediate section in concentric arcs adjacent to radially polarized magnets to equip a magnetic bearing as a torsion drive motor. The magnetic suspension bearing disclosed provides long term reliability without maintenance with application to long term space missions such as the VISSR/VAS scanning mirror instrument in the GOES program...|$|R

5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in the newspaper Fremover (Narvik, Norway), in May 1994, the English aviation engineer Hugh Tyrer stated that the cause of the accident was probably due to fatigue in the <b>end</b> <b>piece</b> of the transfer mechanism to the elevator. The <b>end</b> <b>piece</b> was in such a state that it would have failed sooner or later in ordinary use. Following this discovery in the wreck, Widerøe had grounded all their Twin Otters and checked these pieces, but without finding any other defect parts. de Havilland Canada had also sent an alert to all operators of the Twin Otter to check the component, and had canceled the contract with the subcontractor. On 800 operating Twin Otters, 86 <b>end</b> <b>pieces</b> were replaced shortly after the accident, although none had fatigue similar to that of LN-BNS. The commission's chair, Ragnar Rygnestad, stated that they had not considered the <b>end</b> <b>piece</b> {{to be part of the}} cause of the accident, and that they therefore had not stress-tested it or the elevator to see what forces were needed to cause a crack. Rygnestad stated that the board knew about the fatigue. He also said that he had no problems with the opening of a new inquiry. Widerøe stated that they trusted the report from the Accident Investigation Board.|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on the fluid dynamic characteristics of the bottom <b>end</b> <b>piece</b> of a nuclear fuel assembly. A commercial CFD code was used to simulate water flows through perforated plates in a square duct to evaluate both turbulence models and mesh refinement. Perforated plates with different diameter holes and one similar to the plate of the bottom <b>end</b> <b>piece</b> were simulated. The numerical results with the optimized mesh and SST k-ω turbulence model showed a good agreement when compared with a conventional methodology (Idelchik). With the same mesh criteria and the SST k-ω turbulence model were accomplished simulations in a standard bottom <b>end</b> <b>piece,</b> with some geometric simplifications. Experiments were also carried out to determine the pressure drop through the bottom <b>end</b> <b>piece.</b> The agreement between the numerical simulations and experimental results can be considered satisfactory but suggests further numerical investigations with bottom piece under real conditions of the experiment, without the geometric simplifications and with a gap between the piece and the wall of the flow channel. Additionally, other turbulence models should be appraised for this complex geometry.

The culture vessel is then inserted into the rotatable portion of the clinostat and subjected to rotate at selected rpms.

40|$|Discrepancies in the {{terminology}} {{of the major}} human salivary glands often appear in anatomical textbooks and tend to adversely affect student's learning experience in Microscopic Anatomy. The main culprit is the inconsistent description of the morphology of these glands secretory <b>end</b> <b>pieces</b> where “acinus” and “alveolus” are used interchangeably. The correct terminology originated from Malpighi (1687), repeated by Kölliker (1854), {{but over the years}} has been misinterpreted by prominent authors {{as a result of the}} nature of specimen preparation. This commentary is based on etymology, current standard light microscopy, research studies and consultation with experts. The overall objective of this publication is to recommend that textbooks should endeavour to modify the relevant descriptions about this terminology in their future editions. The most appropriate terminology for the major human salivary glands would be: (1) the parotid gland, entirely serous, should be called compound acinar glands; (2) the submandibular glands are mixed glands; their serous components are compound acinar while some of the mucinous areas are tubular with serous, crescents or demilunes, as acinar <b>end</b> <b>pieces</b> hence they should be named compound tubuloacinar glands; (3) the sublingual glands, mainly mucous glands with tubular shape, with small acinar <b>end</b> <b>pieces</b> that are serous crescents thence they should be called compound tubuloacinar glands...|$|R
