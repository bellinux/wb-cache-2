50|$|The A243 road in England is a {{partially}} primary status A-road {{that runs from}} Leatherhead in Surrey to Surbiton in the Royal Borough of Kingston Upon Thames, Greater London. It is primary {{for most of its}} length, from Leatherhead to <b>Hook</b> <b>Junction</b> with the A3 before running as a non-primary A-road through Surbiton to its terminus at the A307. Although comparatively short it is a busy road connecting a number of other A roads with the M25 motorway.|$|E
5000|$|It then enters Hinchley Wood {{and passes}} through the Scilly Isles Roundabout with the A307. The road then changes name to Kingston By-pass as a dual-carriageway. It passes near Hinchley Wood railway station just before a {{crossroads}} with Manor Road North and South. It then comes to a roundabout with Claygate Lane and the speed limit increases again to 50 mph (80 km/h). It heads through the edge of Long Ditton with a slip road heading to the A3. The A309 then continues for a short stretch before entering the Royal Borough of Kingston Upon Thames to <b>Hook</b> <b>Junction</b> with the A243 (Kingston to Leatherhead) and the A3 (London to Portsmouth) ...|$|E
50|$|The road {{enters the}} Royal Borough of Kingston Upon Thames, Greater London {{entering}} the hamlet of Malden Rushett crossing the B280 road, named Fairoak Lane on the left, and Rushett Lane on the right. The A243 continues and passes the Chessington World of Adventures theme {{park on the}} left. The area gradually gets more built up, and it passes Garrison Lane, which goes to Chessington South railway station. The road goes into the centre of Chessington and comes to a roundabout with two minor roads, one of which Bridge road, a link road to Chessington North railway station and Epsom. It then goes through Hook, and it passes Hook Parade, which has a few shops on it. It is briefly a dual carriageway approaching the <b>Hook</b> <b>junction</b> with the A3 and the south-east terminus of the A309.|$|E
50|$|It is {{situated}} directly {{next to the}} north side of the A3 Kingston Bypass, near the Red Lion Business Park, not far from the A243 <b>junction</b> (<b>Hook</b> underpass), between Tolworth and Hook.|$|R
6000|$|Yes; {{but under}} as stern {{anatomical}} law as the limbs of an animal; and those <b>hooked</b> <b>junctions</b> in Plate 4. {{are just as}} accurately representative of the branching of wood as this (fig. 2.) is of a neck and shoulders. We should object to such a representation of shoulders, because we have some interest in, and knowledge of, human form; we do not object to Claude's trees, because we have no interest in, nor knowledge of, trees. And if it be still alleged that such work is nevertheless enough to give any one an [...] "idea" [...] of a tree, I answer that it never gave, nor ever will give, an idea of a tree to any one who loves trees; and that, moreover, no idea, whatever its pleasantness, is of the smallest value, which is not founded on simple facts. What pleasantness may be in wrong ideas we do not here inquire; the only question for us has always been, and must always be, What are the facts? ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{school is}} {{situated}} on a main road, Hook Road, Surbiton and {{off of the}} A3 at the <b>Hook,</b> London <b>Junction.</b> The closest railway stations are Chessington North, Tolworth & Surbiton where frequent and quick trains run from Clapham Junction, Vauxhall, Wimbledon, Hinchley Wood, Hampton Court, Guildford, Raynes Park & much more. As well as a vast covering by trains many local buses run (which are free with an Oyster Card) these are; ...|$|R
50|$|To {{determine}} the cause of the fracture, the SAN piano key was heated above its glass transition temperature for a short time. If there is residual stress within the polymer, the piece will shrink when held at such a temperature. Results showed that there was significant shrinkage, particularly at the <b>hook</b> end-spring <b>junction.</b> This indicates stress concentration, possibly the combination of residual stress from forming and the action of the spring. It was concluded that although there was residual stress, the fracture was due to a combination of the tensile stress from the spring action and the presence of the ketone solvent.|$|R
50|$|The {{route of}} the road {{travelled}} from the Hudson River at Paulus <b>Hook</b> to Communipaw <b>Junction</b> where a toll was collected. It then ran parallel to the Morris Canal through Greenville to Curries Woods., passing through Bayview - New York Bay Cemetery. Crossing the canal at Pamrapo, it proceeded south into Saltersville and Centerville ending at Bergen Point. Transfer to ferries to Elizabethport across Newark Bay, and to Staten Island across Kill van Kull were possible.|$|R
