40|$|This article {{appeared}} in the "Multimedia at Work" column of IEEE Multimedia, Vol 4, No. 3, July-September 1997. Copyright 1997, IEEE. Why {{is it so hard}} to design a reasonably intelligent, general-purpose web agent? Ironically, although HTML is designed for computers to manipulate, it stores information in a way meant only for humans to understand. HTML data is mostly in a human-readable text (usually English), laid out for human visual understanding (tables, frames, <b>headlines,</b> visual <b>lists)</b> and interspersed with human-readable pictures and graphics. As bandwidth increases and multimedia continues to make inroads on the Web, this picture will only get worse: if you think that English sentences are difficult for a computer to understand, wait until computers try to comprehend the content of MPEG movies. As a result, despite the latest advances in networking, knowledge representation, pattern recognition, and natural language processing, web agents are still unable to provide reasonable answers to most simple web queries. Consider the following queries, all of which can all be easily solved by a computer program given a structured database of relevant data. None can be solved by general-purpose web agents today: ffl I'm doing a report on artist families.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on a cycle of late 1960 s true crime films {{depicting}} topical mass/serial murders.

Whilst this cycle was central to critical debates about screen violence during this key moment of institutional, regulatory and aesthetic transition, they have been almost entirely neglected or, at best, misunderstood. Meeting at the intersection of, and therefore falling between the gaps of scholarship on the Gothic horror revival and New Hollywood’s violent revisionism, this cycle reversed the generational critical divisions that instigated {{a new era in}} filmmaking and criticism.

Guidance in the form of The Circular on headline earnings is issued by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA), and is updated every time when there are changes to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Circular adopts a rules-based approach and specifies what is included and excluded in the calculation of headline earnings. The rules consist of general rules, which apply to all entities other than those industry groups with special provisions such as the life insurance entities. This study questions whether a rules-based headline earnings approach or a principles-based approach is more appropriate for the calculation of <b>headline</b> earnings of <b>listed</b> property entities on the JSE, for economic decision-making purposes.

40|$|Modern media {{messages}} are visually fragmented {{since they are}} built up of various visual elements and units (Holsanova & Nord, 2010). This tendency has also been described as atomization of news texts (Knox, 2007) or as modularization of the text design (Bucher, 2000). Media {{messages are}} also multimodal {{in the sense that}} they contain delimited parts of text (articles, <b>headlines,</b> briefs, <b>lists</b> of items, fact boxes), static and dynamic pictures and graphics (photos, drawings, diagrams, graphs, maps, films, video clips, animations, typographic and layout elements) and auditive parts (speech files, sound, music, etc.). Moreover, media messages are multisequential since they offer various entry points and reading paths. Thus, there is no obvious linear order in which these messages should be perceived. All these characteristics influence the reception of media messages. The following questions arise: How does the reader choose entry points and reading paths, and navigate in the media? How does the reader create coherence in the fragmented message? How does the reader integrate information coming from different sources (text, photos, graphs, etc.) in the process of meaning-making? In our contribution, we will summarize relevant media design principles coming from various design disciplines (information design, document design, multimedia design, web design) but also theoretical and applied works on media structures coming from media discourse, social semiotics, rhetoric, literary science and discourse analysis (section 2). A special focus will be on cognitive principles underlying media design, promoting interaction, integration and understanding of the message. Further, we connect production and reception perspectives and discuss the effect of media design principles on readers’ behaviour and users’ meaning-making (section 3). In particular, we show how the spatial proximity principle, the signalling principle and the dual scripting principle can support the reader, attract the reader’s attention, provide attentional guidance throughout the message, and facilitate information processing and semantic integration of the complex material. Finally, in section 4, we will discuss the relations between media structures, media design principles and different ways of reading...|$|R
40|$|Much {{has been}} written, by academics, about media {{coverage}} as being contrarian indicators i. e. media headlines {{have an impact}} on the share price performance of featured companies. The objective of this study was to investigate if this phenomenon was true for listed South African Companies. Thus the study determined if newspapers were effective contrarian indicators for companies listed in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE). This determination was through a recognised research method and statistical analysis. The study analysed 257 Business Day <b>headlines,</b> featuring JSE <b>listed</b> companies. The study then assessed share price performance for the period 120 days before and 120 days after the headline announcement. The study found that press announcements do {{have an impact on}} the share price performance of JSE listed companies and that the impact was significantly higher than those reported in the developed capital markets. The study further determined that positive headlines lead to positive company share price performance; and that negative headlines do not necessary lead to a negative share price performance. The study also found that the impact of these press announcements is influenced by the company’s market capitalisation and sector. It was shown that companies with a large market capitalisation experienced significant impact on share price performance compared to companies with a small market capitalisation.

The United Nations War Crimes Commission operated in London from 1943 to 1948, and collected evidence on war crimes committed by the governments of its 17 members at the time. While investigating the charges a case file on each individuals or unit was opened.The lists, consisting of around 3,000 pages in total, were found accidentally on a shelf {{in the basement of}} the WNRC by Richard L.

40|$|This report {{presents}} and demonstrates possible solutions to implement two <b>headline</b> policy indicators <b>listed</b> under the biodiversity criteria: the EEA/SEBI 2010 Indicator 13 ¿fragmentation and connectivity of ecosystem¿ and the MCPFE 4. 7 Indicator ¿Landscape level forest spatial pattern. Focus is clearly on large regions assessment {{and on the}} change in the forest landscape structure (spatial pattern), not its function or quality. A brief review of knowledge enabled to select important concepts and principles to address spatial pattern processes likely to have ecological effects. It is proposed to make the assessment at local level with relatively fine-grained data and the reporting per spatial units which best capture local processes without loosing too much information. In some cases, forest losses must be disaggregated from forest gains and treated separately. Measures for MCPFE 4. 7 are based on (1) the morphology of the forest cover in terms of core forest (interior forest with a 100 m edge width) and forest edge, also providing an insight on connectors, and on (2) the landscape context of forest in its close (50 ha) surroundings (natural context or mixed forest-non forest interface zones with agriculture and/or infrastructure). The temporal stability of core forest (i. e. forest potentially staying in the same conditions), the increase of edges and the loss of forest in a natural context are measured. For the SEBI 2010 indicator 13, fragmentation is looked upon when associated to core forest loss and each of the four spatial pattern processes (attrition, perforation, shrinkage, fragmentation/breaking-apart) that potentially contribute to four effects (sample, area, edge, isolation) on forest habitat and species is quantified. Measures on forest connectivity combine the landscape and organism dimensions; they account for the habitat availability and inter-patch functional distances. The measures were based on the application of three methods and GIS techniques. Data inputs were forest-non forest masks, the forest spatial pattern maps obtained by applying the mathematical morphology based software GUIDOS, the landscape patterns maps obtained by applying the landscape mosaic index and the equivalent connectivity area index derived from the Conefor Sensinode software. The analysis was conducted to demonstrate the methods with the only readily available, harmonized, relatively fine-grained and bi-temporal European-wide land cover data from CORINE Land Cover (100 m spatial resolution, 25 ha minimum mapping unit) of years 1990 and 2000. Forest habitat maps do not exist over large regions. For each measure, local spatial information was aggregated per province (NUTS level 2 or 3, 564 provinces in total) and results were presented on the basis of European-wide maps and tabular data. Indicator layers can be queried on line at the map viewer of the European Forest Data Centre (EFDAC) : [URL] The additional delivery of a European-wide snap-shot of hot-spot provinces was proposed to identify provinces where changes in spatial pattern (particularly forest loss, loss of forest in natural context, core forest fragmentation, forest connectivity loss) were significant (both in area and proportionally to the forest). Ecological impacts of spatial pattern processes would be more likely in those provinces. With the data at hand used for demonstrating the methods, 106 hot-spot provinces were flagged. It will be now essential to further compare local change in forest spatial pattern with net forest area change, and add complementary field-based data on forest quality. JRC.
