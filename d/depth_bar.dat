40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a {{research}} project comparing the effect of surface crack width and degree of corrosion on the bond strength of confined and unconfined deformed 12 and 16 mm mild steel reinforcing bars. The corrosion was induced by chloride contamination of the concrete and an applied DC current. The principal parameters investigated were confinement of the reinforcement, the cover <b>depth,</b> <b>bar</b> diameter, degree of corrosion and the surface crack width. The results indicated that potential relationship between the crack width and the bond strength. The results also showed an increase in bond strength at the point where initial surface cracking was observed for bars with confining stirrups.

40|$|Fundamental {{statistical}} analysis {{has been conducted}} on the long-term and large-scale evolutions of sandbars on Ishikawa Coast, Japan. The bar behavior is quantified in terms of bar crest position, crest/trough <b>depth,</b> <b>bar</b> height, and other parameters using a bathymetric data set with an alonghosre extent of 21. 5 km and sampled for more than 40 years. The correlations for couples of parameters {{as well as the}} characteristics of temporal and spatial variation have been examined. The results revealed that the bar behavior along the Ishikawa Coast is characterized by the presence of cyclic cross-shore migration of outer bars with approximately 10 -year periods. Superimposed on periodical migration, the outer bar position has a clear onshore trend in longer time scale of decades under the influence of overall erosion of the study area...|$|E

The principal parameters investigated are the cover <b>depth,</b> <b>bar</b> diameter, degree of corrosion, and the surface crack width. The results show a strong relationship between the average surface crack width and the average bond strength; the degree of corrosion does not demonstrate such a clear relationship. The bars with a 1 C/F (cover/diameter) show an initial increase in bond strength at the first visible crack; no similar initial increase is observed for the bars with 3 C/F. The bottom-cast bars display a higher bond strength with no corrosion, but a similar bond strength is observed for both top- and bottom-cast bars once cracking is observed...|$|E

50|$|The depth {{compensating}} systems discharge {{a portion}} of the diver's tidal volume which varies in inverse proportion to the absolute pressure. At the surface they generally discharge between 20% (1/5) and 33% (1/3)of each breath, but that decreases with depth, to keep the oxygen fraction in the loop approximately constant and reduce gas consumption. A fully depth compensated system will discharge a volume of gas, inversely proportional to pressure, so that the volume discharged at 90m <b>depth</b> (10 <b>bar</b> absolute pressure) will be 10% of the surface discharge. This system will provide an approximately fixed oxygen fraction regardless of depth, when used with the same make-up gas, because the effective mass discharge remains constant.|$|R

The technique {{is based on}} the application of two feedforward backpropagation neural networks; one to estimate <b>bar</b> <b>depth</b> and the other to estimate bar diameter. Both of the networks have been trained on a set of data that consists of the peak parameters of six different bars scanned at 41 different <b>bar</b> <b>depths.</b> These input and target data must be pre-processed to obtain a good network generalisation. By testing the two networks with a completely different set of data, accurate performance has been obtained.

The advantage of the neural network method for extracting information is that it continues to operate reliably for very deep bars, for which the signal strength is severely attenuated and manifests a poor signal-to-noise ratio.

40|$|AbstractOn {{the base}} of {{laboratory}} experiments the nonlinear wave transformation above submerged rectangular permeable and solid bars was investigated. A transmission coefficient and a change of mean wave period as parameters of wave transformation were considered. Both of these parameters can characterize an ability of submerged structure to reduce a wave impact in coastal zone. It was revealed that for decreasing of mean wave period solid submerged bar is more effective, but permeable bar is more effective for decreasing of wave height. The optimal relations for transmission coefficient and change of mean wave period in dependence of parameters of bar and waves were revealed. For decreasing of wave mean period the optimal length of solid bar must be 0. 4 of initial wavelength and 0. 1 - for permeable bar. For decreasing of wave height the length of bar for permeable bar must be 0. 21 of initial wavelength and for solid bar - 0. 55.
