25|$|The British company Rotron, which specialises in {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle (UAV) {{applications of}} Wankel engines, has designed and built a unit to operate on heavy fuel for NATO purposes. The engines uses spark ignition. The prime innovation is flame propagation, ensuring the flame burns smoothly across the whole combustion chamber. The fuel is pre-heated to 98 degrees Celsius before it is injected into the combustion chamber. Four spark plugs are utilised, aligned in two pairs. Two spark plugs ignite the <b>fuel</b> <b>charge</b> {{at the front of}} the rotor as it moves into the combustion section of the housing. As the rotor moves the <b>fuel</b> <b>charge,</b> the second two fire a fraction of second behind the first pair of plugs, igniting near the rear of the rotor at the back of the <b>fuel</b> <b>charge.</b> The drive shaft is water cooled which also has a cooling effect on the internals of the rotor. Cooling water also flows around the external of the engine through a gap in the housing, thus reducing the heat of the engine from outside and inside eliminating hot spots.|$|E
25|$|The USS Nautilus, the world's first nuclear submarine, {{revolutionized}} naval warfare. Conventional submarines {{need two}} engines: a diesel engine {{to travel on}} the surface and an electric engine to travel submerged, where oxygen for a diesel engine is not available. By relying on nuclear capability, the USS Nautilus could travel uninterrupted for thousands of miles below the surface with a single <b>fuel</b> <b>charge.</b> Beginning in 1951, Admiral Hyman Rickover can be credited for the design of the world's first nuclear submarine who led and oversaw a group of scientists and engineers at the Naval Reactors Branch of the Atomic Energy Commission. After sea trials were conducted and testing was completed, the USS Nautilus became fully operational in January 1955.|$|E

This {{would be a}} thermal breeder reactor, which in principle can be refueled – after its initial <b>fuel</b> <b>charge</b> – using only naturally occurring thorium. According to the three-stage programme, Indian nuclear energy could grow to about 10 GW through PHWRs fueled by domestic uranium, and the growth above {{that would have to}} come from FBRs till about 50GW.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{achieved}} {{the goals of}} producing a throttling engine with high enough RPM that was small enough {{to be used in}} transportation Daimler and Maybach built the 1884 engine into a two-wheeled test frame which was patented as the [...] "Petroleum Reitwagen" [...] (Petroleum Riding Car). This test machine demonstrated the feasibility of a liquid petroleum engine which used a compressed <b>fuel</b> <b>charge</b> to power an automobile.

2500|$|Lower fuel cost. The salts {{are fairly}} {{inexpensive}} compared to solid fuel production. For example, while beryllium is quite expensive per kg, {{the amount of}} beryllium required for a large 1GWe reactor is quite small. ORNL's MSBR required 5.1 tons of beryllium metal, as 26 tons of BeF2. At a price of $147/kg BeF2, this inventory would cost less than $4 million, a modest cost for a multibillion-dollar power plant. Consequently, a beryllium price increase over the level assumed here has little effect in {{the total cost of}} the power plant. [...] The cost of enriched lithium-7 is less certain, at $120–800/kg LiF. and an inventory (again based on the MSBR system) of 17.9 tons lithium-7 as 66.5 tons LiF makes between $8 million and $53 million for the LiF. Adding the 99.1 tons of thorium at $30/kg adds only $3 million. Fissile material is more expensive, especially if expensively reprocessed plutonium is used, at a cost of $100 per gram fissile plutonium. With a startup fissile charge of only 1.5 tons, made possible through the soft neutron spectrum this makes $150 million. Adding everything up brings the total cost of the one time <b>fuel</b> <b>charge</b> at $165 to $210 million. This is similar to the cost of a first core for a light water reactor. Depending on the details of reprocessing the salt inventory once can last for decades, whereas the LWR needs a completely new core every 4 to 6 years (1/3 is replaced every 12 to 24 months). ORNL's own estimate for the total salt cost of even the more expensive 3 loop system was around $30 million, which is less than $100 million in today's money.|$|E

50|$|In 1946, the {{production}} restarted {{with a larger}} two-cylinder 654 cc Lloyd-made engine with a bore of 70 mm and stroke of 85 mm producing 25 bhp at 2450 rpm. The twin-cylinder alloy unit was mounted transversely at the front and drove the front wheels through a four-speed gearbox with synchromesh on all speeds including reverse. It was still a two-stroke but the bearings were pressure lubricated. A third cylinder and piston which had a reciprocating and slightly rotating motion {{was connected to the}} carburettor with ports in the cylinder walls connecting to the engine's two cylinders. This was used to draw the fuel mixture from the carburettor and transfer the mixture to each engine cylinder. This double-acting <b>fuel</b> <b>charging</b> cylinder piston was hollow with ports located in the piston walls and ports located in the charging cylinder walls connecting to each of the engine's main cylinders. One engine cylinder was charged by the charging cylinder piston's down and slightly rotating stroke which allowed the piston and charging cylinder side wall port to uncover and allow the mixture transfer to the engine cylinder. The other engine cylinder was charged with mixture by the upwards stroke of the charging cylinder piston. The engine cylinders and the <b>fuel</b> <b>charging</b> cylinders were set in a triangular configuration with the <b>fuel</b> <b>charging</b> cylinder being located centrally and receiving gravity fed fuel from the bulkhead mounted fuel tank. This method of mixture input to the engine cylinders allowed for the engine wet oil sump.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{desirable}} that burnup {{should be}} as uniform as possible both within individual fuel elements and from one element to another within a <b>fuel</b> <b>charge.</b> In reactors with online refuelling, fuel elements can be repositioned during operation to help achieve this. In reactors without this facility, fine positioning of control rods to balance reactivity within the core, and repositioning of remaining fuel during shutdowns in which {{only part of the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>charge</b> is replaced may be used.|$|E

5000|$|Since the {{beginning}} of World War I in 1914, magneto-equipped aircraft engines have typically been dual-plugged, whereby each cylinder has two spark plugs, with each plug having a separate magneto system. Dual plugs provide both redundancy should a magneto fail, and better engine performance (through enhanced combustion). Twin sparks provide two flame fronts within the cylinder, these two flame fronts decreasing the time needed for the <b>fuel</b> <b>charge</b> to burn, thereby burning more of the fuel at a lower temperature and pressure [...] As the pressure within a cylinder increases, the temperature rises; {{and if there is}} only a single plug, the unburnt fuel away from the original flame front can self-ignite, producing a separate unsynchronized flame front. This leads to a rapid rise in cylinder pressure, producing engine [...] "knock". Higher octane fuel delays the time required for auto-ignition at a given temperature and pressure, reducing knock; so by burning the <b>fuel</b> <b>charge</b> faster, two flame fronts can decrease an engine's octane requirement. As the size of the combustion chamber determines the time to burn the <b>fuel</b> <b>charge,</b> dual ignition was especially important for the large-bore aircraft engines around World War II.|$|E

50|$|It was alleged by {{the then}} administrators that Air New Zealand {{had engaged in}} asset {{stripping}} of the airline as well as <b>charging</b> of its <b>fuel</b> costs due to Air New Zealand failing to hedge its fuel costs thus leaving it susceptible to major fluctuations in <b>fuel</b> <b>charges</b> during 2000.
