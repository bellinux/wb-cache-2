A study was conducted to map the <b>ICT</b> <b>skill</b> levels of the LIS professionals working in Visvesvaraya Technological University engineering college libraries of Karnataka. Among 194 college libraries, 446 LIS professionals responded and the study revealed that a majority of them need training in ICTs for rendering better information services.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the skill-biased {{technological}} revolution associated with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), firms with relatively high (low) proportions of skilled workers can be expected to have a comparative advantage (disadvantage) in minimising the costs both of ICT adoption and of learning how to make best use of ICTs. In this paper we make use of benchmarking survey data for UK enterprises between 1997 - 99, combined with post-survey financial data for the same enterprises, in order {{to assess the impact of}} <b>ICT</b> <b>skill</b> constraints on financial performance at firm level. The results provide clear evidence that <b>ICT</b> <b>skill</b> constraints have an indirect negative impact on firm performance as a result of the restrictions that such skill deficiencies place on ICT adoption and on the intensity of use of ICTs (once they have been installed). However, there is only weak evidence of skill constraints impinging directly on firm performance at given levels of ICT adoption and utilisation...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the influence of Information and Communication Technology (<b>ICT)</b> literacy <b>skills</b> on electronic information resources (EIR) use among lecturers of two private universities in Oyo State, Nigeria. Descriptive survey design was adopted for the study and using total enumeration sampling technique, the study population and study sample consisted of 234 (Two hundred and thirty four) academic staff from both Ajayi Crowther University (ACU) and Lead City University (LCU). Questionnaire was the data collection instrument used. Data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The findings revealed that E-mail and Websites were the most available resources to lecturers of both universities. Lecturers in ACU had high <b>ICT</b> literacy <b>skills</b> in General Computer Operation while those in LCU had high <b>ICT</b> literacy <b>skills</b> in General Computer Operation, Internet Browsing, Internet Searching and Computer Appreciation. E-Mail and website were the most often used e-resources among lecturers of both universities, erratic power supply and poor internet connection were the major challenges encountered in the use of e-resources. There was a positive significant relationship between <b>ICT</b> literacy <b>skills</b> and e-resources use of lecturers...|$|R

40|$|Information and {{communication}} technologies (ICTs) provide enormous potential for enhancing productivity {{of human resources}} in {{both public and private}} sectors. However, net returns on ICTs capital have been observed to be higher in many of the developed countries than in developing countries. This is because ICTs have enhanced productivity and competitiveness in various organisational processes including management of human resources in both public and public sectors. Using some examples from both developed and developing countries, the paper demonstrates how ICTs can enhance human resource productivity. However, most of the developing countries including Tanzania are yet {{to catch up with the}} above productivity enhancement observed in developed countries. The paper discusses some of the prerequisites needed to attain high human resource productivity from ICTs. For example, it is demonstrated that some of the recruitment and selection as well as promotion procedures do not value the <b>ICT</b> professional <b>skills</b> but academic qualifications for specific jobs requiring <b>ICTs</b> <b>skills.</b> The paper ends with some recommendations on how developing countries can raise the effectiveness of deploying ICTs in managing scarce resources including human resource. Some of the recommended measures have potentials through various ICTs multiplier effects to benefit local economies too if managed effectively...|$|R
