40|$|We {{present a}} suite of new {{high-resolution}} records (0 - 135 ka) representing pulses of aeolian, fluvial, and biogenic sedimentation along the Senegalese continental margin. A multiproxy approach based on rock magnetic, element, and color data was applied on three cores enclosing the present-day northern limit of the ITCZ. A strong episodic aeolian contribution driven by stronger winds and dry conditions and characterized by high hematite and goethite input was revealed north of 13 °N. These millennial-scale dust fluxes are synchronous with North Atlantic Heinrich stadials. <b>Fluvial</b> <b>clay</b> input driven by the West African monsoon predominates at 12 °N and varies at Dansgaard-Oeschger time scales while marine productivity is strongly enhanced during the African humid periods and marine isotope stage 5. From latitudinal signal variations, we deduce that the last glacial ITCZ summer position was located between core positions at 12 ° 26 ' and 13 ° 40 'N. Furthermore, this work also shows that submillennial periods of aridity over northwest Africa occurred more frequently and farther south than previously thought...|$|E
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarChloride and nitrate {{concentrations}} in groundwater are mapped {{on a national}} scale using classification, point kriging, stratified point kriging and stratified block kriging. A soil map aggregated to six main soil types (peat, sand, marine clay, <b>fluvial</b> <b>clay,</b> old clay and loam) is used as classification criterion. Zinc and cadmium {{concentrations in}} groundwater are mapped on a national scale using stratified block kriging. The results are presented as 95 % confidence intervals of the predictions. When spatial dependence between measurements is observed, kriging interpolation results in more spatially differentiated maps than those obtained by classification. For mapping on a national scale block kriging seems more appropriate than point kriging {{because of the large}} uncertainties that result from the latter. Stratification preceding kriging is needed because of important differences between the strata. High concentrations along the coast characterise the chloride concentration maps. Block averages indicate a difference between high sand areas with chloride concentrations below 50 mg/l and areas near the coast with chloride concentrations above 50 mg/l. All methods used for mapping nitrate produce overlapping confidence intervals. The upper side of the confidence intervals show high tendencies on areas with high sand soils. In the provinces Noord-Brabant and Limburg (South East Holland) some areas have block averaged zinc and cadmium concentrations higher than the background value (a-level). The confidence intervals do not exclude b- or c-levels (signal and danger levels, respectively) ...|$|E

40|$|Systematic {{analysis}} of Pb, Sr and Nd isotopes of 32 <b>fluvial</b> <b>clay</b> samples (< 2 µm fraction) {{from many of}} the major tributaries of the vast (1. 10 ⁶ km²) Murray Darling Basin (MDB), located in semiarid southeastern Australia, displays similar isotopic values between some MDB clays and dust from several ice core samples from the EPICA Dome C in Antarctica. Close scrutiny of several ratios of the four Pb isotopes, and in particular ²⁰⁸Pb/²⁰⁷Pb versus ²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁷Pb, shows that several samples from the Darling-sub-basin of the MDB display similar values for the same isotopes for Dome C samples from different ages, and more particularly during wet phases in Australia [Marine Isotopic Stages 5 e, 3 and 1]. The combination of Nd and Sr isotopic ratios from the same MDB fluvial clays clearly eliminates the Murray sub-basin, and supports the Darling sub-basin as a potential source of aeolian material to Antarctica. Overall, the Australian dust supply to Antarctica predominantly occurred during interglacial periods. The work presented here shows that aerosols generated in southeastern Australia can travel to parts of West Antarctica and this is supported by atmospheric observations and models. In addition, evidence of Australian dust in Antarctic ice cores further implies dust deposition in the Southern Ocean would have occurred in the past. Current meteorological observations also imply that the western Pacific and Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean would frequently receive aeolian dust components originating from southeastern Australia. 19 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Minerals are the {{building}} blocks of clastic sediments and play an important role with respect to the physico-chemical properties of the sediment and the lithostratigraphy of sediments. This paper aims to provide an overview of the mineralogy (including solid organic matter) of sediments as well as suspended matter as found in the Netherlands (and some parts of Belgium). The work is based on a review of the scientific literature published over more than 100 years. Cenozoic sediments are addressed together with suspended matter and recent sediments of the surface water systems because they form a geoscientific continuum from material subject to transport via recently settled to aged material. Most attention is paid to heavy minerals, clay minerals, feldspars, Ca carbonates, reactive Fe minerals (oxides, siderite, sulphides, glauconite) and solid organic matter because they represent the dominant minerals and their properties form a main issue in subsurface and water management. When possible and relevant, the amounts, provenance, relationship with grain size distribution, early diagenesis and palaeohydrological evolution are described. Tables with statistical data about the mineral contents and isotopic composition of carbonates and organic matter are presented as overviews. The review on the mineralogy of Dutch fluvial and marine environments is more extensive than that for the other sedimentary environments because the first two have been studied much more intensively than the others and they also form the larger part of the Dutch deposits. The focus is on the natural background mineralogy of Dutch sediments, but this is hard for recent sediments, largely because the massive hydraulic infrastructure present in the Netherlands has probably also affected the mineralogy and geochemistry of sediments deposited in recent centuries. Many findings are summarised, several of which lead to more general insights for the Dutch situation. Ca carbonates in sediments often have several provenances and thus must be considered as mixtures. Dolomite is commonly present in addition to calcite. The importance of biotite as weatherable mica is unclear. Weathering of heavy minerals plays some role but it is unclear in which way it affects the heavy mineral associations. Clays are usually dominated by illite, smectite and their interstratified variant, while kaolinite is usually below 20 % and chlorite below 5 %. Vermiculite is a minor constituent in <b>fluvial</b> <b>clays</b> and its illitisation presumably happens during early diagenesis in the marine environment. Opaque Fe hydroxides can be present in addition to Fe oxyhydroxide coatings and both will play a role in redox chemistry as reactive Fe minerals. Feldspars in marine sediments must be present but they have not been properly studied. The genesis of rattle stones and carbonate concretions has not been completely elucidated. The fraction of terrigeneous organic matter in estuarine and coastal marine sediments is substantial. The available data and information are spread irregularly over the country and the reviewed information discussed in this paper is derived from relatively small-scale studies dealing with a limited amount of analysed samples. Much information is available from the Scheldt estuaries in the southwestern part of the Netherlands partly due to the severe contamination of the Western Scheldt in recent decades...|$|R
40|$|Ovate pellets of {{kaolinite}} from. 05 to 1. 5 millimeters {{in length}} occur in conglomerates inter-bedded with pyroclastic materials and waterlaid sediments in the Eocene Calapooya formation at Hobart Butte, Oregon. Although Miocene hydrothermal solutions invaded these rocks, al-tered welded tufts to clay, and deposited kaolin minerals together with realgar, stibnite, pyrite, quartz, and other minerals, a hydrothermal ora volcanic origin for the pellets is considered un-likely. The {{sizes and shapes}} of the pellets, the presence of pellets and llthic fragments within pellets, the lack of radial and concentric structures, the presence of charcoal, llgnitic material, and diatoms in the matrix suggest <b>fluvial</b> deposition of <b>clay</b> flakes, broken from thin clay layers that had dried on Eocene flood plains.

40|$|The {{sedimentary}} facies of the Maastrichtian Enagi Formation exposed {{across the}} Agbona ridge at Share and Shonga areas was investigated {{for the first}} time to characterize their depositional facies and interpret the depositional environments. Well exposed vertical profiles of the sediments were studied along road cuts, erosional channels and cliff drops with special attention focused on their internal physical and biogenic attributes. The facies and facies associations in the lithostratigraphic units mapped include conglomerate, sandstone and claystone. The conglomerate facies is moderately sorted; grain supported and mature, showing evidence of reworking and recycling. Association of this facies with herringbone cross stratified sandstone beds probably indicates tidal channel lag origin. The sandstone facies are commonly compositionally mature, bioturbated and contain clasts of reworked clays and clay drapes and these suggest high energy tidal channels and shoreface. The associated unidirectional cross bedded sandstones subfacies and kaolinitic claystones are interpreted as braided fluvial channels and floodplain deposits. The gross sedimentation pattern and characteristics suggest predominance of trangressive shallow marine processes occasionally incised by <b>fluvial</b> channels. The <b>clay</b> deposit associated with the floodplains may offer economic resource potential in the area...|$|R
40|$|The epicentral {{area of the}} Emilia seismic {{sequence}} {{is located in the}} Emilia-Romagna Region (northern Italy), 45 km from the city of Modena (Figure 1). This area is sited within thrust-related folds of the Ferrara Arc, which represent the most external part of the northern Apennines. This sector is considered as having been active during late Pliocene to early Pleistocene times [Scrocca et al. 2007] and encompasses also the Mirandola and Ferrara seismogenic sources [e. g., Burrato et al. 2003, Boccaletti et al. 2004, Basili et al. 2008]. The main sedimentary infilling of the Po Plain is represented by Pliocene–Pleistocene alluvial deposits (alternating <b>fluvial</b> sands and <b>clays)</b> that overlie a foredeep clastic sequence, with a total average thickness of 2 km to 4 km [e. g., Carminati et al. 2010]. Soon after the mainshock, several liquefaction phenomena coupled to ground fractures were observed in the epicentral area (e. g., San Carlo, Ferrara). Soil liquefaction is a phenomenon in which the strength and stiffness of a soil is reduced by earthquake shaking or other rapid loading. […] Collapsed caves reported in the literature and/or local press [e. g., Febo 1999, Martelli 2002] in the epicentral area were previously investigated by our research group in 2008, with several soil measurements of CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes. Immediately after the May 20, 2012, mainshock and during the Emilia seismic sequence, the collapsed caves were sampled again to determine any variations in these CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{construction of}} a geological model for the Pashian Horizon (D 3 ps) of Aznakaevskaya Area, Romashkinskoye Oil Field. Facies analysis is proposed for determination of spatial arrangement of the facies that contain reservoir beds. Development strategy designed and implemented based on the existing geological model does not ensure desired economic and production performance. The new model designed using facies analysis and up-to-date IT tools (IrapRMS ROXAR software package) with account of tectonic factor enables changing the philosophy and the approach to searching for remaining reserves in poorly swept or by-passed zones. During the Pashian, coastal-marine and offshore facies accumulated within the field: wave-cut zone – basal layer; lagoon zone – lagoon clays; intertidal zone – bar layer and tidal channel (replaces bar sediments); behind-bank zone – behind-bank clays, and alluvial fan facies that overly the behind-bank <b>clays.</b> <b>Fluvial</b> palaeovalleys were also present and contained compound fluvial channel and wave-cut facies. Throughout the geological history, multiple tectonic movements occurred and influenced {{the architecture of the}} deposited facies. At the first stage, well logging data were used to analyze each well and describe the standard cross section with the following facies from bottom to top: basal layer, lagoon clays, bar layer, behind-bank clays. Four cross section types were singled out taking into account secondary facies with regular-sporadic development. In the course of the research, core data on reservoir quality were analyzed to confirm separation into compound and intertidal facies. Porosity distribution histograms were also generated based on well logging findings. The authors of this work believe that the new geological model and the subsequent reservoir simulation model will allow to work out a successful production enhancement strategy to recover the remaining oil reserves localized in poorly swept or by-passed zones...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to use an integrated and multiscale exploration approach to quantify the geomet-rical parameters that are needed to predict block hy-draulic conductivity tensors within fluvial deposits. We use 3 -D ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data, elec-tromagnetic (EM) surveys, resistivity soundings, and hand-augered borings to characterize the 3 -D architec-ture of fluvial deposits on a floodplain of the Pisca-tiquis River, near South Sebec, Maine. Field-scale sur-veys made across the entire floodplain were used to map the depth to the glacially eroded bedrock surface and the thickness of the overlying sediments, which consist of glaciomarine <b>clay,</b> <b>fluvial</b> sands and silts, and over-bank deposits. An EM conductivity anomaly in the cen-ter of the floodplain defines the position of a ridge in the glaciomarine clay deposit. This ridge separates hor-izontally bedded sand and silt deposits in the northern half of the floodplain from inclined point-bar sand and silt deposits in the southern half of the floodplain. The orientation and spacing of the lateral accretion surfaces (or bounding layers) within the point-bar deposits in the southern part of the floodplain were measured in a 3 -D GPR survey conducted over a 50 -m 2 grid. The geomet-rical parameters defining the internal architecture of the point-bar deposits are used to estimate anisotropy ratios for the principal components of the block hydraulic con-ductivity tensor. This integrated exploration approach establishes a framework for quantifying fluvial aquifer heterogeneity from local to regional scales. Geostatisti-cal methods and geological models can be used to in-tegrate the local-scale and field-scale surveys. With the addition of more local-scale surveys, geophysical logs, and high-resolution cores, this exploration approach can be used to develop a multiscale flow model for the entire floodplain...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{study of}} a dense network of high {{resolution}} seismic profiles in the bay of Vilaine, INSU-CNRS cruise Geovill, {{have led to the}} characterization of the architecture of the sediment wedge preserved between the coast and the 50 m isobath. This wedge lies on a substratum composed of three seismic units, U 1, U 2 and U 3 respectively attributed to metamorphic and magmatic rocks, Lutetian and Ypresian sandy carbonates and post-Eocene sediments. The coastal sediment wedge comprises three major units. A basal unit (U 4), dated around 600 to 300 ky BP, interpreted as braided river sandy conglomerates. A median unit (U 5) corresponding to estuarine and <b>fluvial</b> sandstones and <b>clays</b> that give way to the west to mouth bar sandstones. A sommital unit (U 6) attributed to marine argillites and barrier island sandstones dated from 8110 + or - 200 years at the base. These three units are bounded by two major surfaces: an unconformity between U 4 and U 5 and a marine (wave and tidal) ravinement surface between U 5 and U 6. The unconformity is interpreted as a sequence boundary between two depositional sequences: a lower one with U 4 seismic unit and a topmost one with U 5 and U 6 seismic units. Based on the available datations, the lower sequence is attributed to the Saalian and/or Elsterian glacial cycles and, the upper sequence to the Weichselian (lowstand systems tract) and to the Holocene marine transgression (transgressive systems tract). The passage from one sequence to the other corresponds however to a drastic shift in the paleoflow directions (60 degrees) in the Bay of Vilaine closely related to the main faults orientations. The tectonic activity in Brittany during the Pleistocene, linked to intraplate stress, seems to exert a control on sediment architecture in the coastal wedge. Indeed, the tilt of the Armorican Massif during that period has caused a complete rejuvenation of the fluvial profiles in land and the separation of the paleo-Vilaine from the Paleo-Loire river courses...|$|R
40|$|The Pimpama estuarine plain in {{subtropical}} southeast Queensland {{is comprised}} of Quaternary sediments infilling older bedrock. These multilayered unconsolidated sediments have various depositional origins, and are highly heterogeneous. The plain is low-lying and the surface drainage is controlled by flood mitigation measures including tidal gates and channelised streams. The control of surface drainage potentially affects the shallow water table. This modification of hydrology has implications for future viability of agriculture and also the environmental health of waterways. Increased landscape modification and water management is likely in the coming years. The combination of sediment heterogeneity, low hydraulic gradients, and artificial drainage modification result in the plain being hydrogeologically complex. In order to understand hydrologic processes in this setting, a multi-disciplinary research programme was conducted which included a drilling program, overland electromagnetic induction and other geophysical surveys (downhole gamma log, electromagnetic induction and magnetic susceptibility) to initially establish the geologic framework. These surveys were followed by hydrogeochemical testing which includes for major and minor ions and also stable isotopes, and mineralogical analysis of drillhole material. Underlying basement rock occurs at up to 60 m depth. Unconsolidated gravel and sand deposits occur within incised paleo-valleys and are overlain by predominantly low-permeability <b>fluvial</b> sandy <b>clays</b> and estuarine and lagoonal muds. Fine-grained delta sands occur in the top 15 m of the sub-surface. Within the unconsolidated sediments, hydrodynamic trends clearly discriminated between upper unconfined and lower semi-confined aquifer systems. A comparison of surface water and shallow groundwater levels indicate limited interaction of groundwater and surface water. Hydrogeochemical analysis effectively distinguished between groundwater bodies, and also distinguished saline groundwater from seawater. Trends in major ion chemistry in the semi-confined system (particularly Na/Cl and Ca/Cl ratios) showed ion exchange accompanying saline intrusion. However, due to factors such as mineral dissolution, major ion chemistry does not clearly identify solute flux trends in the shallow aquifer system. Water stable isotope analysis (δ 18 O and δ 2 H) indicated the provenance of fresh and saline groundwater and also {{the relative importance of}} the principal hydrologic processes, i. e. evaporation and water uptake by plants. Groundwater exhibited a wide range in salinity, from very fresh to hypersaline. The formation of hypersaline groundwater was attributed largely to uptake of water by mangrove forests. Since mangrove forests were more extensive {{at the time of the}} Holocene maximum sea level (approximately 6, 000 years ago) than at present, some of this groundwater may represent relict salinity from this earlier time. The relationship of relict salinity to low permeability sediments, particularly at intermediate depths, and their depositional history was examined. Vertical salinity gradients and hydrogeochemistry within these sediments varied according to position within the plain, suggesting deposition under various hydrological and sea level regimes. A preliminary investigation using analysis of stable sulfate isotopes (δ 34 S and δ 18 OSO 4) was made. This study shows substantial potential for the application of this technique for quantification of solute flux and sulfur chemical transformations within settings such as this coastal plain. To establish shallow groundwater flow processes, a MODFLOW-based numerical model was used to inversely estimate aquifer parameters under various recharge scenarios. The model was designed to examine the relative importance of evapotranspiration and discharge to surface waters. However, largely due to the complexity of the drainage network and non-uniform surface water flows, the quantification of surface water- groundwater interaction by consideration of hydrodynamics is problematic. Therefore, the chemistry of groundwater and surface water was compared. While the estimated contribution of rainfall to groundwater level fluctuations was significant (46 %), high evapotranspiration rates reduced net recharge and it was concluded that baseflow to drains and creeks during dry periods was insignificant, and groundwater velocities in the shallow aquifer are low. The study illustrates the value of both hydrodynamic and hydrogeochemical analyses in estuarine settings where relict salinity and groundwater-aquifer interactions impact significantly on water quality. Saline groundwater is chemically distinct from theoretical mixtures of seawater and freshwater. The study also demonstrates the value of particular chemical parameters, e. g. Na/Cl and SO 4 /Cl ratios and stable water isotopes, for identifying hydrologic processes in this setting...|$|R
