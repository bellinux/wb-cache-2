Fortunately no records or books of the College were damaged. Repairs to the smoke-damaged rooms and <b>exterior</b> <b>brickwork</b> were completed in December 2009.|$|E
25|$|Exposed masonry. The Neoclassical canon {{enforced}} by AlexanderI required masonry surfaces {{to be finished}} in flush stucco. Byzantine and Russian revival architects radically departed from this rule; instead, they relied on exposing <b>exterior</b> <b>brickwork.</b> While exposed brickwork dominated the scene, it was not universal; exterior stucco remained in use, especially {{in the first decade}} of AlexanderII's reign.|$|E

500|$|The 1849 {{church is}} a small, one-and-a-half-story, front-gable building. The main façade (northwestern elevation) has two main entrances, {{enclosed}} by white-painted wood, recessed panel doors, and capped by white-painted stone lintels with two stone corner blocks. The church's <b>exterior</b> is <b>brickwork,</b> laid in Flemish bond on the main façade and a five-course American bond on the northeastern, southeastern and southwestern elevations. Two blue-gray stained glass windows (installed in 1905) are symmetrically placed above the main entrances, each capped by stone lintels with two stone corner blocks. The main façade is crowned by a white painted entablature molding with two cornice returns, exemplifying Greek Revival architectural design. In {{the top of the}} gable, a square date stone engraved [...] "1849" [...] is embedded in the brickwork above a gooseneck light fixture. Although the church is now topped by a metal standing-seam roof, it was originally sheathed by wooden shakes.|$|R
50|$|A massive seven-year {{restoration}} project {{begun in}} 1989 revived {{the building to}} its original condition. The work involved extensive materials research to determine original paint colors and decorative patterns for the walls and ceilings, including the original hand-painted-and-stenciled designs in a trompe-l'œil effect (an artistic illusion of realism). Interior finishes and fixtures were restored, while the <b>exterior</b> stone and <b>brickwork</b> was conserved and repaired. Renovations created more comfortable work spaces and energy-efficient HVAC systems. Through the effort of many collaborators, the building {{remains one of the}} most venerable displays of architecture in the Milwaukee area.|$|R
5000|$|On January 24, 2005, a fire {{destroyed}} {{the interior of}} the church, leaving only the <b>exterior</b> <b>brickwork</b> intact."The roof, all the interior and even the church's back wall had been destroyed; all that was left were three walls, some concrete supports and the concrete floor." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{main frame}} of the {{skyscraper}} rises 36 stories, capped by two asymmetric spires, one extending for four additional stories. The roof height of the building is 496ft (151m), the top floor is 489 feet (149m), and the spire reaches 632ft (192.6m). Its nickname, Cathedral of Finance, alludes both to the building's resemblance to a cathedral, with its tower over the main entrance and octagonal apse {{at the opposite end}} and to New York City's Woolworth Building, which had earlier been dubbed the Cathedral of Commerce. Native American themes are common inside and outside the building. Wirt C. Rowland, of the Smith, Hinchman & Grylls firm, was the building's architect. The building rises from a granite and stone six story base with two Corrado Parducci created sculptures flanking the Griswold Street entrance. The <b>exterior</b> blends <b>brickwork</b> with tile, limestone, and terra cotta. Rowland's attention to detail was meticulous. He supervised the creation of the colored brick cladding to achieve the desired color for the exterior. Afterward, the brick was marketed by the manufacturer as [...] "Union Trust Brick" [...] and after 1939, as Guardian brick". Rowland designed furniture for the bank's offices and his attention went as far as designing tableware, linens and waitress uniforms for a restaurant in the building.|$|R

50|$|The new {{hotel was}} {{designed}} by Boardman to be spacious, luxurious and to have installed the latest modern fixtures and fittings of the time. Boardman also incorporated into {{the design of the}} new hotel part of the interior decoration of the former solicitor’s offices which had stood on the site. The offices had contained a particularly fine example of a plasterwork ceiling laid on oak lath measuring 17 ft by 30 ft. This section of ceiling had been very carefully removed and was installed in the new first floor drawing room in the hotel, along with French casements to the balcony. The Hotel was six storeys high which included a basement. Many of the front elevation windows were mullioned. Over the front entrance to the Hotel there is a balcony with intricately sculpted brick latticework. This <b>exterior</b> decorative <b>brickwork</b> is known as Costesseyware, with the materials for this work being supplied from the brick works of George Gunton in Costessey. These bricks are to be found on many building in and around Norwich and were used and promoted by local architects such as Boardman and George Skipper. This method of brickwork was easily rubbed and shaped to form intricate patterns and sculptures. The front elevation of the building is a built in a semi circular curve running from the top of Prince of Wales Road into Bank Plain and has three gable end incorporated into the curve all of which have further alternating brickwork decorative detailing. The front elevation at street level was constructed from stone masonry of a colour to match the brickwork, which begins at the first lift at ground floor level. The roof of the hotel was originally tiled with green slate.|$|R
50|$|The <b>exterior</b> <b>brickwork</b> {{is a dark}} red, and was {{the third}} choice for the building. The architects had planned on using a buff-coloured brick, and city councillors {{preferred}} the pale colour of the original town hall. The red was chosen after a local brickyard over-fired its white bricks. The trim is in sandstone, and the large plinth is limestone.|$|E

50|$|From 1964 to 1965 the {{original}} building underwent a major renovation, including {{the addition of}} a concrete frame structure, new floors, a mezzanine and air conditioning and the removal of the skylight, at a cost of over £227,000. The <b>exterior</b> <b>brickwork</b> may also have been rendered at this time. The William Street frontage remained largely intact, as one of the city's few surviving 1870s facades.|$|E
5000|$|Saints Peter and Paul Church is a 42 by 76 ft structure. [...] The {{building}} is Victorian Gothic {{in style and}} constructed in two-tone orange brick laid in a common bond. The upper portion of the exterior walls are a darker shade than the lower portion because there was an insufficient amount of brick fired originally. The foundation is locally quarried rock-faced stone. There is a central entrance tower, which rises 150 ft, and was the tallest structure in Keokuk County when it was built. [...] The <b>exterior</b> features decorative <b>brickwork</b> pilasters and a mock cornice with denticulation. Two sacristies are located {{on either side of}} the apse. The building contains period stained glass windows and has wood carved altars and pews. The 14 stained glass windows in the nave and the apse were donated by parish families and they portray various saints. Donor’s names are inscribed below. The altars are hand carved walnut with gold leaf trim. The work is attributed to Nickolas Juhl of Davenport. Juhl, a German-born Jew, was an accomplished woodcarver who carved the altars for several of Davenport's Catholic churches.|$|R
5000|$|Two other Grade II-listed {{buildings}} are located further south on Dyke Road. The Booth Museum of Natural History {{was built in}} 1874 to house the extensive collection of British birds, insects and other specimens collected by naturalist Edward Booth. It originally stood in the grounds of his home, Bleak House, and became a museum in 1890. Many more collections {{have been added to}} the stock of over half a million specimens, and in 1998 the museum was designated as a [...] "collection of national importance". [...] Architecturally, the long, low, shed-like building has an Italianate/Romanesque Revival <b>exterior</b> with polychrome <b>brickwork.</b> Set into a full-width brick porch are two arched doorways with voussoirs. [...] (Bleak House itself was demolished [...] 1939; flats called Elm Court and Fairways occupy the site.) [...] At the junction of Port Hall Road and Dyke Road is Port Hall, a double-fronted house dating from the early 19th century. Prominent four-centred arches surround the doorway and the windows, and above the first floor runs a parapet with battlements and a frieze. The name [...] is set into a panel on the parapet.|$|R
5000|$|The 1849 {{church is}} a small, one-and-a-half-story, front-gable building. The main façade (northwestern elevation) has two main entrances, {{enclosed}} by white-painted wood, recessed panel doors, and capped by white-painted stone lintels with two stone corner blocks. The church's <b>exterior</b> is <b>brickwork,</b> laid in Flemish bond on the main façade and a five-course American bond on the northeastern, southeastern and southwestern elevations. Two blue-gray stained glass windows (installed in 1905) are symmetrically placed above the main entrances, each capped by stone lintels with two stone corner blocks. The main façade is crowned by a white painted entablature molding with two cornice returns, exemplifying Greek Revival architectural design. In {{the top of the}} gable, a square date stone engraved [...] "1849" [...] is embedded in the brickwork above a gooseneck light fixture. Although the church is now topped by a metal standing-seam roof, it was originally sheathed by wooden shakes.On the church's northeastern elevation there are three large, symmetrical stained-glass windows, each with a fixed upper sash and a lower hopper sash. Like the main façade's doorways and windows, the sills, lintels and lintel corner blocks of the stained-glass windows are white-painted stone. Below the windows is an exposed coursed-stone foundation with five tie-rod masonry anchor plates. A small brick chimney is present on this elevation. The church's southwestern elevation also has a coursed-stone foundation, with five tie-rod anchor plates, banked into the ground below three symmetrical stained-glass windows with fixed upper sashes and lower hopper sashes and encased with white-painted stone sills, lintels and lintel corner blocks. On this elevation are a small brick chimney in the roof slope and metal snowbirds along the roof line. Downspouts are located at the southern corners of the northeastern and southwestern elevations. The church's southeastern (rear) elevation has an exposed coursed-stone foundation 4 ft high, due to its location on sloping ground. At the center of this elevation is a protruding, gabled brick extension for the interior altar, with symmetrical stained-glass windows on both sides. The gabled protrusion is capped by aluminum flashing. An 1895 wrought-iron fence encloses the property's northwestern perimeter, and a paved brick walkway provides pedestrian access from the driveway to the two main entrances.|$|R

50|$|Southern Pacific {{sold the}} {{building}} to the Jenova Land Company in 1993, and ten years later the city of Eugene bought the depot {{as part of a}} plan to develop a regional transportation center. In 2004, the city oversaw a $4.5 million restoration project. Workers restored the <b>exterior</b> <b>brickwork</b> and trim and gutted and renovated the interior. New tile floors, oak and fir trim, covered ceilings, wooden benches and expanded bathrooms were installed.|$|E

50|$|Benjamin F. Kinder, {{owner of}} a {{hardware}} store, built a house in 1907. The Kinder family lived here until the 1960s, {{and the house was}} already viewed as a historical building of Des Plaines by 1969. The original location of the house was at 777 Lee Street, but was moved to its present location at 789 Pearson Street in 1978. The significance of the Kinder House comes from its past inhabitants and architectural style. Benjamin Kinder was the owner of one of the city’s longest-standing businesses, and his son George served as Des Plaines’ third mayor. The Kinder House is referenced to the term Queen Anne which was a popular style in the late 19th and early 20th centuries’ architecture. These homes contain bay windows, asymmetrical facades, gables, etc. The Kinder House particularly possesses features such as the wrap-around porch and a round three-story corner tower. Since the Kinder House did not have as much ornamentation as other homes of the Queen Anne style, it was viewed {{as an example of a}} late, modified style of the Queen Anne. Upon moving the home to its present location, the structure of the Kinder House was left nearly the same as it was built with an exception to the <b>exterior</b> porches. The <b>brickwork,</b> woodwork, windows, cabinets, and floor plans remain intact from the Kinder household. Now, the Kinder House serves as a museum, where touring is available on appointment.|$|R

50|$|During {{the reign}} of Charles I the Hall {{was used as a}} {{military}} storehouse and served as a hospital following the Battle of Marston Moor. In 1655 it was remodelled for use as a prison with additional internal walls and <b>exterior</b> <b>brickwork</b> being added to the building. Between 1705 and 1946 the Hall also became home to the Blue Coat School, initially a charity school for forty boys which was based on the first floor, until the prison was relocated by the 1820s and the school occupied the whole building. This {{was not the first time}} the Hall was a centre for education, in 1579 the chapel had been used to teach children French.|$|E
