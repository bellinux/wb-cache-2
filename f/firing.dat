5|$|Advancements in {{microscopic}} stamping {{have led}} to a push for the inclusion of <b>firing</b> pin microstamping. The microstamp is etched onto the <b>firing</b> pin and is transferred to the cartridge during the <b>firing</b> process. Each <b>firing</b> pin would have a unique serial number allowing investigators to trace casings found at a crime scene to a known firearm. The practice is not in use , although California has enacted legislation that requires microstamping on all newly sold firearms. The law, and microstamping in general, has received significant opposition from gun manufacturers due to increased costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.|$|E

Different equipments such as <b>fire</b> extinguisher, axes and cutting equipment are used to fight against <b>fire.</b> <b>Fire</b> fighting vehicle {{is being used to}} transport firefighters to the scene as well as transport the <b>fire</b> fighting equipments. The <b>fire</b> fighter is still facing the risk of <b>fire</b> hazard because they still need to go near to <b>fire</b> scene. To reduce the <b>fire</b> fighter risk during <b>fire</b> incident, a <b>fire</b> fighting mobile robot is designed. <b>Fire</b> fighting mobile robot is a remote controlled machine that replace <b>fire</b> fighter to perform <b>fire</b> fighting task. The application of <b>fire</b> fighting mobile robot is able to reduce the direct contact of <b>fire</b> fighter to the <b>fire</b> hazards. The paper reviews a variety of technologies and state-of-the-art technology of <b>fire</b> fighting mobile robot.

5|$|Autocannons have an {{automatic}} <b>firing</b> mode, {{similar to that}} of a machine gun. They have mechanisms to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a higher rate of fire than artillery, often approaching, or, in the case of rotary autocannons, even surpassing the <b>firing</b> rate of a machine gun. While there is no minimum bore for autocannons, they are generally larger than machine guns, typically 20mm or greater since World War II and are usually capable of using explosive ammunition even if it isn't always used. Machine guns in contrast are usually too small to use explosive ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Beginning around 1 pm, Union {{artillery}} fired first, initially upon infantry in the woods, {{and later}} upon any Confederate artillery that attempted {{to move into}} <b>firing</b> position. On the Confederate left flank, two batteries from Whiting's division and one from Jackson's soon began <b>firing</b> from their position upon Darius Couch's division of the IV Corps, who were {{near the center of}} the Union line. This began a fierce firefight, with the Union's eight batteries and 37 guns concentrated against three Confederate batteries and sixteen guns. The Union fire silenced the Rowan Artillery and made their position untenable. The other two Confederate batteries, placed by Jackson himself, were in somewhat better positions, and managed to keep <b>firing.</b> Over a period of more than three hours, a total of six or eight Confederate batteries engaged the Union Army from the Confederate left flank, but they were usually engaged only one at a time.|$|E
