40|$|There are {{two main}} {{components}} to the <b>irradiation</b> <b>spectrum</b> which {{need to be considered}} in radiation effects studies on nonmetals, namely the primary knock-on atom energy spectrum and ionizing radiation. The published low-temperature studies on A 1203 and MgO suggest that the defect production is nearly independent of the average primary knock-on atom energy, {{in sharp contrast to the}} situation for metals. On the other hand, ionizing radiation has been shown to exert a pronounced influence on the microstructural evolution of both semiconductors and insulators under certain conditions. Recent work on the microstructure of ion-irradiated ceramics is summarized, which provides evidence for significant ionization-induced diffusion. Polycrystalline samples of MgO, A 120 3, and MgAJ 20 4 were irradiated with various ions ranging from 1 MeV H ' to 4 MeV Zr * ions at temperatures between 25 and 650 °C. Cross-section transmission electron microscopy was used to investigate the depth-dependent microstructure of the irradiated specimens. Dislocation loop nucleation was effectively suppressed in specimens irradiated with light ions, whereas the growth rate of dislocation loops was enhanced. The sensitivity to <b>irradiation</b> <b>spectrum</b> is attributed to ionization-induced diffusion. The interstitial migration energies in MgAI 2 O 4 and A 120 3 are estimated to be < 0. 4 eV and < 0. 8 eV, respectively for irradiation conditions where ionization-induced diffusion effects are expected to be negligible...|$|E

40|$|Publisher: ACS, ISSN 1520 - 6106 International audienceUnder UV irradiation, poly(vinyl cinnamate) (PVCi) films undergo {{cross-linking}} due to [2 + 2] photocycloaddition between cinnamoyl groups.

This mechanism is studied {{with regards to the}} level of the electronic absorption of cinnamate centered at 278 nm. It acts on refractive index by shifting the absorption UV band. Most of the time, this influence vanishes in the near infrared region (NIR). It is due to antagonist phenomena acting at the expense of the index lowering. The causes analysis leads us to optimize the <b>irradiation</b> <b>spectrum,</b> providing higher index contrasts between irradiated and nonirradiated area.

40|$|Abridged) We have {{conducted}} a study of [NeII] line emission based on a sample of 92 pre-main sequence stars mostly belonging to the infrared Class II, including 13 accreting transition disk objects and 14 objects driving jets and outflows. We find several significant correlations between L[NeII] and stellar parameters, in particular LX and the wind mass loss rate, dM/dt. Most correlations are, however, strongly dominated by systematic scatter. While {{there is a positive}} correlation between L[NeII] and LX, the stellar mass accretion rate, dMacc/dt, induces a correlation only if we combine the largely different subsets of jet sources and stars without jets. Our results suggest that L[NeII] is bi-modally distributed, with separate distributions for the two subsamples. The jet sources show systematically higher L[NeII], by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude with respect to objects without jets. Jet-driving stars also tend to show higher mass accretion rates. We therefore hypothesize that the trend with dMacc/dt reflects a trend with dM/dt that is more physically relevant for [NeII] emission. L[NeII] measured for objects without known outflows and jets is found to agree with simplified calculations of [NeII] emission from disk surface layers if the measured stellar X-rays are responsible for heating and ionizing of the gas. The large scatter in L[NeII] may be introduced by variations of disk properties and the <b>irradiation</b> <b>spectrum,</b> as previously suggested.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of the spectrally resolved collection efficiency is of great importance in solar cell characterization. Under standard conditions the bias light is a solar simulator or a light source with a similar broadband <b>irradiation</b> <b>spectrum.</b> When a colored blue or red bias light is used instead, an enhanced collection efficiency effect, in the literature known as the photogating effect, can be observed under certain conditions. While most of the published reports on such effect were on solar cells with amorphous silicon based absorber layers, we {{have shown that the}} enhanced collection efficiency could be also present in thin film silicon solar cells where hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc-Si:H) is used as the absorber layer. In this article we present detailed experimental results and simulations aiming at a better understanding of this phenomenon. We show that the collection efficiency is strongly dependent on the intensity of bias light and the intensity of the monochromatic light. These experimental results are consistent with the computer predictions made by our code. We also show that the photogating effect is greatly enhanced when nanocrystalline silicon cells are built with an improperly doped p-layer or with a defective p/i interface region due to the reduced internal electric field present in such cells. The existence of this effect further proves that carrier transport in a nc-Si:H solar cell with an i-layer made close to the phase transition regime is influenced to a large extent by drift transport. The study of this effect is proposed as an alternative approach to gain a deeper understanding about the carrier transport scenarios in thin film solar cells, especially nanocrystalline silicon solar cell...|$|E

40|$|Context. Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray photons from {{classical}} T Tauri {{stars are}} powerful ionization and heating agents that drive disk chemistry, disk instabilities, and photoevaporative flows. The mid-infrared fine-structure line of [Ne II] at 12. 81 mu m {{has been proposed}} to trace gas in disk surface layers heated and ionized by stellar X-ray and EUV radiation. Aims. We aim at locating the origin of [Ne II] line emission in circumstellar environments by studying distributions of [Ne II] emission and correlating the inferred [Ne II] luminosities, L([Ne II]), with stellar and circumstellar disk parameters. Methods. We have conducted a study of [Ne II] line emission based on a sample of 92 pre-main sequence stars mostly belonging to the infrared Class II, but including 13 accreting transition disk objects, and also 14 objects that drive known jets and outflows. Results. We find several significant correlations between L([Ne II]) and stellar parameters, in particular L(X) and the wind mass loss rate,. (M) over dot(loss). Most correlations are, however, strongly dominated by systematic scatter of unknown origin. While {{there is a positive}} correlation between L([Ne II]) and L(X), the stellar mass accretion rate,. (M) over dot(acc), induces a correlation only if we combine the largely different subsets of jet sources and stars without jets. Our results indeed suggest that L([Ne II]) is bi-modally distributed, with separate distributions for the two subsamples. The jet sources show systematically higher L([Ne II]), by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude with respect to objects without jets. Jet-driving stars also tend to show higher mass accretion rates. We therefore hypothesize that the trend with. (M) over dot(acc) only reflects a trend with (M) over dot(loss) that is more physically relevant for [Ne II] emission. Conclusions. The [Ne II] luminosities measured for objects without known outflows and jets are found to agree with simplified calculations of [Ne II] emission from disk surface layers if the measured stellar X-rays are responsible for heating and ionizing the gas. The large scatter in L([Ne II]) may be introduced by variations of disk properties and the <b>irradiation</b> <b>spectrum,</b> as previously suggested. If these additional factors can be sufficiently well constrained, then the [Ne II] 12. 81 mu m line should be an important diagnostic for disk surface ionization and heating, at least in the inner disk region.

The systematically enhanced [Ne II] flux from jet sources clearly suggests a role for the jets themselves, as previously demonstrated by a spatially resolved observation of the outflow system in the T Tau triple...|$|E

On the one hand, restricting the cell acceptance to the small incidence angle of direct and circumsolar irradiation enhances the maximum path length of the light in a solar cell with Lambertian surfaces even above the Yablonovitch limit (ultra-light-trapping). On the other hand, restrictions to small acceptance angles imply losses of diffuse sunlight, even for perfectly tracked cells. Using temporally resolved solar <b>irradiation</b> <b>spectra,</b> we simulate the enhancement and loss in the annual energy yield of silicon solar cells of various thicknesses.
