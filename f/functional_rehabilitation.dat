40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Randomized {{controlled}} {{trial with}} 1 -year follow-up. OBJECTIVE: To analyze {{the effects of}} an exercise program or routine follow-up on patients with chronic low back pain who have completed <b>functional</b> multidisciplinary <b>rehabilitation.</b> The short- and long-term outcome in terms of symptoms and physical and social functioning was compared. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Systematic reviews have shown that <b>functional</b> multidisciplinary <b>rehabilitation</b> improves physical function and reduces pain in patients with chronic low back pain. However, long-term maintenance of these improvements is inconsistent {{and the role of}} exercise in achieving this goal is unclear. METHODS: One hundred five chronic patients with low back pain who had completed a 3 -week <b>functional</b> multidisciplinary <b>rehabilitation</b> program were randomized to either a 3 -month exercise program (n = 56) or routine follow-up (n = 49). The exercise program consisted of 24 training sessions during 12 weeks. Patients underwent evaluations of trunk muscle endurance, cardiovascular endurance, lumbar spine mobility (flexion and extension range-of-motion, fingertip-to-floor distance), pain and perceived functional ability at {{the beginning and the end}} of <b>functional</b> multidisciplinary <b>rehabilitation,</b> at the end of the exercise program (3 months) and at 1 -year follow-up. Disability was also assessed at the same time points except at the beginning of <b>functional</b> multidisciplinary <b>rehabilitation.</b> RESULTS: At the end of the <b>functional</b> multidisciplinary <b>rehabilitation,</b> both groups improved significantly in all physical parameters except flexion and extension range-of-motion. At the 3 month and 1 year follow-up, both groups maintained improvements in all parameters except for cardiovascular endurance. Only the exercise program group improved in disability score and trunk muscle endurance. No differences between groups were found. CONCLUSION: A favorable long-term outcome was observed after <b>functional</b> multidisciplinary <b>rehabilitation</b> in both patient groups. Patients who participated in an exercise program obtained some additional benefits. The relevance of these benefits to overall health status need to be further investigated...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: In {{recent decades}} the {{treatment}} of non-specific low back pain has turned to active modalities, {{some of which were}} based on cognitive-behavioural principles. Non-randomised studies clearly favour <b>functional</b> multidisciplinary <b>rehabilitation</b> over outpatient physiotherapy. However, systematic reviews and meta-analysis provide contradictory evidence regarding the effects on return to work and functional status. The aim of the present randomised study was to compare long-term functional and work status after 3 -week <b>functional</b> multidisciplinary <b>rehabilitation</b> or 18 supervised outpatient physiotherapy sessions. METHODS: 109 patients with non-specific low back pain were randomised to either a 3 -week <b>functional</b> multidisciplinary <b>rehabilitation</b> programme, including physical and ergonomic training, psychological pain management, back school and information, or 18 sessions of active outpatient physiotherapy over 9 weeks. Primary outcomes were functional disability (Oswestry) and work status. Secondary outcomes were lifting capacity (Spinal Function Sort and PILE test), lumbar range-of-motion (modified-modified Schöber and fingertip-to-floor tests), trunk muscle endurance (Shirado and Biering-Sörensen tests) and aerobic capacity (modified Bruce test). RESULTS: Oswestry disability index was improved to a significantly greater extent after <b>functional</b> multidisciplinary <b>rehabilitation</b> compared to outpatient physiotherapy at follow-up of 9 weeks (P = 0. 012), 9 months (P = 0. 023) and 12 months (P = 0. 011). Work status was significantly improved after <b>functional</b> multidisciplinary <b>rehabilitation</b> only (P = 0. 012), resulting in a significant difference compared to outpatient physiotherapy at 12 months' follow-up (P = 0. 012). Secondary outcome results were more contrasted. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Functional</b> multidisciplinary <b>rehabilitation</b> was better than outpatient physiotherapy in improving functional and work status. From an economic point of view, these results should be backed up by a cost-effectiveness study...|$|R

40|$|To {{assess the}} cost-utility of an {{exercise}} programme vs usual care after <b>functional</b> multidisciplinary <b>rehabilitation</b> {{in patients with}} chronic low back pain. Cost-utility analysis alongside a randomized controlled trial. A total of 105 patients with chronic low back pain. Chronic low back pain patients completing a 3 -week <b>functional</b> multidisciplinary <b>rehabilitation</b> were randomized to either a 3 -month exercise programme (n = 56) or usual care (n = 49). The exercise programme consisted of 24 training sessions during 12 weeks. At the end of <b>functional</b> multidisciplinary <b>rehabilitation</b> and at 1 -year follow-up quality of life was measured with the SF- 36 questionnaire, converted into utilities and transformed into quality [...] adjusted life years. Direct and indirect monthly costs were measured using cost diaries. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated as the incremental cost of the exercise programme divided by the difference in quality-adjusted life years between both groups. Quality of life improved significantly at 1 -year follow-up in both groups. Similarly, both groups significantly reduced total monthly costs over time. No significant difference was observed between groups. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 79, 270 euros. Adding an exercise programme after <b>functional</b> multidisciplinary <b>rehabilitation</b> compared with usual care does not offer significant long-term benefits in {{quality of life and}} direct and indirect costs...|$|R
