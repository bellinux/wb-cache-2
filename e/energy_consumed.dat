50|$|In late 2008, a {{new type}} of camera emerged called mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera (MILC), which uses various sensors and offers lens interchangeability. These are simpler and more compact than DSLRs due to not having a lens reflex system. MILC camera models are {{available}} with various sensor sizes including: a small 1/2.3 inch sensor, as is commonly used in bridge cameras such as the original Pentax Q (more recent Pentax Q versions have a slightly larger 1/1.7 inch sensor); a 1-inch sensor; a Micro Four Thirds sensor; an APS-C sensor such as the Sony NEX series, Fujifilm X series, Pentax K-01, and Canon EOS M; and some, such as the Sony α7, use a full frame (35 mm) sensor and even Hasselblad X1D is the first medium format MILC. Disadvantage of MILC over DSLR is battery <b>energy</b> <b>consume</b> due to high <b>energy</b> <b>consume</b> of electronic viewfinder.|$|R

25|$|The {{island of}} Samsø erected 11 one-megawatt, {{land-based}} wind turbines in 2000, followed by ten offshore 2.3MW wind turbines completed in 2003. Together with other renewable energy measures, this community of 4,200 achieved fame, claiming {{that it is}} the largest carbon-neutral settlement on the planet. This claim exploits the general discourse, that one can neglect carbon-dioxide and other pollution from fossil fuel consumption (cars, imported electricity, heating for houses...), if the yearly average electricity production from sustained sources is higher than the total <b>energy</b> <b>consumed.</b>|$|E
25|$|Compared to the {{environmental}} impact of traditional energy sources, {{the environmental}} impact of wind power is relatively minor. Wind power consumes no fuel, and emits no air pollution, unlike fossil fuel power sources. The <b>energy</b> <b>consumed</b> to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months. While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use.|$|E
25|$|The {{two main}} types of heat pumps are {{compression}} and absorption. Compression heat pumps operate on mechanical energy (typically driven by electricity), while {{absorption heat pump}}s may also run on heat as an energy source (from electricity or burnable fuels). An absorption heat pump may be fueled by natural gas or LP gas, for example. While the gas utilization efficiency in such a device, which is {{the ratio of the}} energy supplied to the <b>energy</b> <b>consumed,</b> may average only 1.5, that is better than a natural gas or LP gas furnace, which can only approach 1.|$|E

Although the <b>energy</b> they <b>consume</b> is not the same as when they are switched on, putting them off when not in use can save some measure of energy. Consumers should be appropriately informed by the manufacturers of the energy electrical appliances at standby mode. A good way to do this is to inscribe it on a label and stick them to the appliances.|$|R
