This claim, however, might just be a way for Mailer to mitigate any negative criticism and show modesty by denying his abilities, or as a ruse to <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> discover for ourselves whether Mailer can write a good short story.|$|E
25|$|The law of {{accelerating}} returns is {{the basis}} for all of these speculations about creating a digital brain. It explains why computational capacity will continue to increase unabated even after Moore's Law expires, which Kurzweil predicts will happen around 2020. Integrated circuits, the current method of creating computer chips, will fade from the limelight, while some new more advanced technology will pick up the slack. It is this new technology that will <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the massive levels of computation needed to create an artificial brain.|$|E
25|$|If the {{immediate}} international situation {{is used as}} an excuse to <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> drop our opposition to the rearmament programme of the Government, the next phase must be that we must desist from any industrial or political action that may disturb national unity in the face of Fascist aggression. Along that road is endless retreat, {{and at the end of}} it a voluntary totalitarian State with ourselves erecting the barbed wire around. You cannot collaborate, you cannot accept the logic of collaboration on a first class issue like rearmament, and at the same time evade the implications of collaboration all along the line when the occasion demands it.|$|E

500|$|Mustaine {{revealed}} the album's North American release date as November 1, 2011. Mustaine previously said the label was [...] "looking at November 1st.

[...] This live performance Mustaine mentioned would ultimately turn out to be an appearance on the October 31, 2011 edition of Jimmy Kimmel Live!. The band, performing in Halloween costumes, played [...] "Public Enemy No. 1" [...] and [...] "Symphony of Destruction", the former of which was televised.

500|$|Frank Spotnitz {{said of the}} episode's origins, [...] "We've {{destroyed}} all {{the stuff}} about Mulder's father, the project, and the Syndicate. All the things that had sustained us for six years were suddenly gone. We had no crutches. From that point on, every time we sat down to write a mythology show, {{we knew it was}} going to be a completely different challenge." [...] Chris Carter saw the episode as a transitional episode, stating [...] "I felt that, with [...] "The Sixth Extinction", I was just playing a supporting role and that the episode, essentially the middle episode of a three-episode arc, was just a transitional episode to <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> '', which was really less about the mythology and more about Mulder's choices in life." ...|$|E

I wanted to experiment." [...] Bono noted that the end product [...] "doesn't quite get off the ground the way I'd hoped it would." [...] An early mix of the track was included on some versions of the 20th anniversary reissue of Achtung Baby. The mix, titled [...] "'Baby' Acrobat", contained lyrics that were later modified to a different perspective ("You know I'd hit out if I only knew who to hit" [...] instead of the final [...] "I know you'd hit out if you only knew who to hit") or scrapped entirely ("If the sky turns to purple and the moon turns to blood / Will you dig me out when I'm face down in the mud").|$|E

500|$|Ryan McGee of Zap2it {{also had}} a {{positive}} review of the episode, writing that [...] "Confidence Man" [...] was [...] "A taut, tense, character-based episode which excelled on the Island and paid off in the flashback as well." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave the episode a 82/100, praising Sawyer's performance, and writing {{that it was a}} [...] "a very well written story", but criticized the music montage at the end as being a crutch, explaining that [...] "It’s as if the directors can’t think of any other way to finish the show." [...] Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club gave [...] "Confidence Man" [...] a B and wrote that [...] "Sawyer’s flashback is really well done", but adds that [...] "Lost—at least at this point in its run—is not calibrated for one of its characters to torture another one. The episode simply doesn’t do enough to <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> the point where we can understand why this event was necessary, and why cooler heads couldn’t have prevailed." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The Los Angeles Times ranked the episode as the 83rd best of Lost (excluding the finale), writing the episode is [...] "Not bad, but giving Sawyer a big, epic origin story feels kind of beside the point." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 1988, the State of California Board of Medical Quality charged Landy with {{ethical and}} license code {{violations}} {{stemming from the}} improper prescription of drugs and various unethical personal and professional relationships with patients, citing one case of sexual misconduct with a female patient, along with Wilson's psychological dependency on Landy. Landy denied the allegations, but later admitted {{to one of the}} seven charges which accused him of wrongfully prescribing drugs to Wilson. Landy surrendered his psychological license, complying with an agreement made with the state of California, and was not allowed applications for reinstatement for the next two years. An August 1988 board meeting with the Beach Boys had Landy promising that Brian would reconnect with the group, which Love says: [...] "was a ruse to <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> write a letter in his defense against the California authorities. We never wrote the letter, and Brian's public behavior continued to unsettle." [...] Landy and his colleagues claimed that his treatment of Wilson ended in February 1988 {{at the request of the}} state attorney general's office, but the deputy attorney who drafted the complaint reported that he was not aware of any such request, nor was the office advised that they sever Landy's relationship with Wilson. Others witnessed no changes, and Landy's assistants remained with Wilson. Samuels believed, [...] " [...] still has an oral drive. He would still overeat and overdose if you let him. He has total freedom in every other way." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lose Yourself" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by most television critics. James Poniewozik of Time has mixed {{reactions to the}} episode. He was critical of the plot arc between Grey and Chase, [...] harshly criticizing Grey's acting and expressing that [...] " [...] didn't think that Adrian Grenier had completely sold Vince’s downward spiral." [...] He continued: [...] "There’s something half-jokey about his manner that makes me think he’s about to break up laughing, as in a blooper reel." [...] In contrast, Poniewozik felt that [...] "for {{the first time in}} a while, I’m really interested to see what happens on Entourage next." [...] Dan Philips of IGN gave the episode a nine out of ten, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. Philips praised [...] "Lose Yourself", opining that it was an [...] "excellent, extremely entertaining climax to this season's two main plot lines." [...] He added, [...] "Even though the episode never got around to providing any resolution, the overall journey was engaging enough to make its cliffhanger feel less like a cheap trick to <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> tune in for season eight." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Josh Wagler of MTV, who praised Grenier's performance, opining that it was his best performance to date. The A.V. Club writer Kyle Ryan gave the episode a 'B-' grade. Ryan wrote, [...] "The last episode teed up tonight’s many confrontations [...] For a show that has specialized in spinning its wheels, these were surprisingly high stakes." [...] He was critical with the development of Vincent Chase, as well as his storyline with Sasha Grey, commenting that [...] "Vincent and his coterie just aren’t that interesting." ...|$|E

2500|$|The press duly {{built the}} series up as a must-see, but {{the players were}} far more reticent {{than they had been}} during the {{adjacent}} encounter three years before. [...] Early in December, however, Australian captain Ricky Ponting drew considerable criticism for his comments about the ICC's wines and spirits. [...] "It has taken us a long time and a lot of great wins in different conditions around the world to <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> that number-one spot", Ponting declared, speaking to the Associated Press. [...] "If South Africa beat us three-nil I don't know if that gives them enough points to get over us. [...] But if they won the series one-nil or two-one, I don't think that would mean that they deserve to take over that mantle. [...] It's a bit the same with India last series. [...] Just because they beat us, the number-one team, doesn't necessarily mean they go from the number four or number five in the world to number one in the world, because it's something that's accrued {{over a long period of}} time." [...] The remark was seen as fatalist and trivialising, suggesting that the rubber hardly mattered and, in the eyes of many, that Ponting's hopes of securing a series victory were low.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{introduction}} of computers into {{education is not}} important because it is <b>getting</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> talk about computers. It {{is important because it}} is <b>getting</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> talk about education. Because the computer offers such a range of applications, we are forced to ask {{what we are going to}} use it for and why we are choosing to use it in a certain way with certain students. It is ant excuse, and a good one, to reflect on our practice, to articulate our educational goals, and to surface hidden assump-tions and values, which may be guiding our practice without our being aware of what a powerful influence they are having. Although this article is about special educa-tion and computers, in some ways it is neither about special education nor about computers.

2500|$|Accounts differ {{as to who}} popularized the term. President George W. Bush {{introduced}} the term officially during his presidency. According to Safire, author Christopher Hitchens was responsible for its diffusion, while Valerie Scatamburlo d'Annibale argues that its popularization {{is due to the}} work of Eliot Cohen, former counselor to Condoleezza Rice, reputed occasionally to be [...] "the most influential neocon in academe". It circulated in neoconservative circles for some years after 2001 and came into wider currency after President George W. Bush, still grappling to find a phrase that might identify the nature of the [...] "evil" [...] which would define the nature of his enemy in the War on Terror, stated in 2005 that Islamofascism was an ideology synonymous with Islamic radicalism and militant jihadism, which, he then clarified, was decidedly distinct from the religion of Islam. It moved into the mainstream in August 2006. [...] After the arrest of Islamic terrorists suspected of preparing to blow up airlines, Bush once more alluded to [...] "Islamic Fascists", apparently a [...] "toned-down" [...] variant of the word, The public use of the neologism and the analogous Islamic fascism during the run-up to the U.S. 2006 mid-term elections, perhaps with a specific focus group in mind, provoked an outcry, or storm of protest, and was quickly dropped from the president's rhetorical armory. Katha Pollitt, stating the principle that, [...] "if the control the language, you control the debate", remarked that while the term looked [...] "analytic", it was emotional and [...] "intended to <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> think less and fear". David Gergen, former speechwriter for Richard Nixon, commented that the phrase [...] "confuses more than it clarifies", for [...] "Islamic fascism has no meaning" [...] in the Arab world. Neoconservative writers, critics and scholars from Hitchens to Robert Wistrich however responded that the Muslim religion itself is fascistic, a view which, in identifying Islam with political fascism, was lambasted for being as offensive as the term Judeo-Nazi coined in the 1970s by Yeshayahu Leibowitz, editor of the Encyclopedia Hebraica, to characterize Messianic Jews settling in the occupied West Bank. Hitchens replied that the link is no more deleterious than that made by Leibowitz, or by left-wing analysts who wrote of clerical fascism.|$|E
