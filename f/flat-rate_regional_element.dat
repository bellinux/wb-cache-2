40|$|Operation {{offshore}} or regionalization {{is one of}} the key strategies by many Malaysian MNCs nowadays. The {{purpose is}} to expand their business and also establish a sustainable business model. This change in business direction introduces impacts to performance management framework. If these impacts are not properly handled, it may leads to business expansion failure. The current performance management framework will have to be enhanced such that the regional needs in the performance management are catered. The objective of this research is to identify the impacted areas in the current performance management framework and recommend necessary enhancements. Base on the research, there are 5 areas in the performance management framework impacted by operation offshore or regionalization, they are “Employee satisfaction and work-life balance”, “HR Development”, “Staff Recruitment and Retention”, Standardization” and “Culture and Perception”. It is essential to add in the <b>regional</b> <b>elements</b> into the above 5 impacted areas in order to ensure the organization continue with sustainable growth after regionalization.

Among them, quadrants HH and LL are spatially positively correlated, indicating strong homogeneity while quadrants LH and HL are negatively correlated, indicating strong heterogeneity.|$|R

50|$|The Vinča {{culture in}} Romania comes {{in many forms}} {{depending}} on the local background against which it developed (the Starčevo-Criş culture and the linear pottery) {{and the degree of}} southern influence.

A general characteristic of these groups is the black polished pottery (cups, bowls, lids, etc.). The decorations are variously incised and impressed (bands filled in with stripes, in particular) in addition to displaying fine grooves. The statuettes feature oblong heads (possibly indicating a mask), cross-like bodies, and are often decorated with spiral winding patterns.|$|R
