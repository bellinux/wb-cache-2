5|$|Banksia verticillata, {{commonly}} known as granite banksia or Albany banksia, is a species of shrub or (rarely) tree of the genus Banksia in the family Proteaceae. It is native to the southwest of Western Australia and can reach up to 3m (10ft) in height. It can grow taller to 5m (16ft) in sheltered areas, and much smaller in more exposed areas. This species has elliptic <b>green</b> <b>leaves</b> and large, bright golden yellow inflorescences or flower spikes, appearing in summer and autumn. The New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) is the most prominent pollinator, although several other species of honeyeater, as well as bees, visit the flower spikes.|$|E
5|$|In north-west Nelson, {{there are}} three {{ecotypes}} defined by soil and exposure. Trees growing on limestone bluffs have stiff, blue-green leaves. On the river flats, the trees are tall with narrow, lax, dark <b>green</b> <b>leaves,</b> and an uneven canopy. They resemble the cabbage trees of the North Island's East Cape. Along the coast to the far west, the trees are robust with broad, bluish leaves. The latter two forms extend down the West Coast, with the lax-leaved forms growing in moist, fertile, sheltered river valleys while the bluish-leaved forms prefer rocky slopes exposed to {{the full force of}} the salt-laden coastal winds.|$|E

40|$|Application of {{levulinic acid}} (LA), a {{competitive}} inhibitor of δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase, to greening plant tissues causes ALA to accumulate {{at the expense}} of chlorophyll. 4, 6 -Dioxoheptanoic acid (DA), which has been reported to be an effective inhibitor of this enzyme in animal systems, has a similar but more powerful effect on ALA and chlorophyll metabolism in <b>greening</b> <b>leaves</b> of Hordeum vulgare L. var. Larker. Both LA and DA also inhibit the uptake of [14 C]amino acids into etiolated and <b>greening</b> barley <b>leaves</b> and reduce their incorporation into protein. Treatment of etiolated and <b>greening</b> <b>leaves</b> with these compounds results in the inhibition of 14 CO 2 evolution from labeled precursors, including amino and organic acids. Inhibition of 14 CO 2 evolution by these compounds is more effective in <b>greening</b> <b>leaves</b> than in etiolated leaves when [4 - 14 C]ALA or [1 - 14 C]glutamate are employed as precursors. Both LA and DA also inhibit the uptake and increase the incorporation of 32 Pi into organophosphorus by etiolated barley leaves. These results indicate that LA and DA have more far-reaching effects upon plant metabolism than was previously believed...|$|R
5|$|Sweltering / Yellowing: Unique {{to yellow}} teas, warm and damp tea leaves from after kill-green {{are allowed to}} be lightly heated in a closed container, which causes the {{previously}} <b>green</b> <b>leaves</b> to turn yellow. The resulting leaves produce a beverage that has a distinctive yellowish-green hue due to transformations of the leaf chlorophyll. Through being sweltered for 6–8 hours at close to human body temperatures, the amino acids and polyphenols in the processed tea leaves undergo chemical changes to give this tea its distinct briskness and mellow taste.|$|E
5|$|In Northland, C.australis shows a {{great deal}} of genetic diversity—suggesting it is where old genetic lines have endured. Some trees in the far north have floppy, narrow leaves, which {{botanist}} Philip Simpson attributes to hybridisation with C.pumilio, the dwarf cabbage tree. In eastern Northland, C.australis generally has narrow, straight dark <b>green</b> <b>leaves,</b> but some trees have much broader leaves than normal and may have hybridised with the Three Kings cabbage tree, C.obtecta, which grows at North Cape and on nearby islands. These obtecta-like characteristics appear in populations of C.australis along parts of the eastern coastline from the Karikari Peninsula to the Coromandel Peninsula. In western Northland and Auckland, a form often called tītī grows. When young, tītī are generally very spindly, and are common in young kauri forests. When growing in the open, tītī can become massive trees with numerous, long thin branches and relatively short, broad leaves.|$|E
5|$|Stems mainly {{provide support}} to the leaves and {{reproductive}} structures, but can store water in succulent plants such as cacti, food as in potato tubers, or reproduce vegetatively as in the stolons of strawberry plants or {{in the process of}} layering. Leaves gather sunlight and carry out photosynthesis. Large, flat, flexible, <b>green</b> <b>leaves</b> are called foliage leaves. Gymnosperms, such as conifers, cycads, Ginkgo, and gnetophytes are seed-producing plants with open seeds. Angiosperms are seed-producing plants that produce flowers and have enclosed seeds. Woody plants, such as azaleas and oaks, undergo a secondary growth phase resulting in two additional types of tissues: wood (secondary xylem) and bark (secondary phloem and cork). All gymnosperms and many angiosperms are woody plants. Some plants reproduce sexually, some asexually, and some via both means.|$|E

40|$|The {{chemical}} induction of porphyrin synthesis {{has been}} investigated in etiolated and <b>greening</b> <b>leaves</b> of Phaseolus vulgaris L. var. Red Kidney. When these leaves are incubated in darkness with solutions of transition metal ion chelators such as α,α′-dipyridyl, 1, 10 -phenanthroline, pyridine- 2 -aldoxime, or other related aromatic heterocyclic nitrogenous bases, they synthesize large amounts of protochlorophyllide and Mg protoporphyrins. <b>Greening</b> <b>leaves</b> produce more porphyrin than do etiolated leaves under such conditions. If the leaves are then transferred to 1 millimolar solutions of various transition metal salts such as Fe 2 +, Zn 2 +, or Co 2 + (but not Mn 2 + or Mg 2 +), Mg protoporphyrin (monomethyl ester) synthesis immediately ceases and the pigment(s) rapidly disappear(s); protochlorophyllide synthesis gradually diminishes during 4 to 8 hours of treatment. The loss in Mg protoporphyrin(s) can {{be accounted for by}} a simultaneous increase in protochlorophyllide in partially <b>greened</b> <b>leaves</b> but not in etiolated leaves. In the latter, the decline in Mg protoporphyrin(s) initiated by the application of Zn 2 + is retarded by low temperature and anaerobiosis but not by respiratory inhibitors. Cycloheximide inhibits the loss of Mg protoporphyrin(s) but does not affect their conversion to protochlorophyllide...|$|R
5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the <b>green</b> <b>leaves</b> of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia levis grows as a tall shrub {{to small}} tree, and can reach 5m (16ft) in height. The flaky soft bark is dark grey on the surface, while deeper layers are reddish in colour. Within the bark are epicormic buds, which sprout new growth after bushfire. The new growth is smooth to {{slightly}} hairy. The large <b>green</b> <b>leaves</b> measure 6 to 14cm (2.2–5.5in) in length, and 1.3 to 8cm (0.5–3.2in) in width, and are oblong or sickle-shaped (falcate).

The bright green foliage, particularly of new growth, stands {{out against the}} more subdued tones of the surrounding vegetation and the stems, which are reddish in colour. The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April), and peak over December to February. They are arranged on short axillary racemes along the branchlets. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth, consisting of tepals fused {{for most of their}} length, within which are both male and female parts. The central style is surrounded by the anther, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma, which is located {{at the tip of the}} style. The smooth fleshy fruit, known as a drupe, is green and more or less round, measuring 1cm (0.4in) by 0.8cm (0.3in) in diameter. It contains two seeds, and has a spike at the end. The drupe is juicy but stringy when unripe, and the seeds and skin are inedible.|$|E
