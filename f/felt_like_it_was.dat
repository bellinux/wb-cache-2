Even though it featured sports as the theme, it wasn't any funnier for those who played hockey as a kid, but could be enjoyed by anybody that has seen this type of film. The only problem that we had with the episode was the disregard for Steve Irwin's death.

According to Kelly, the payment covered one half or less of the production costs of the music video, and Black's family could have paid nothing in exchange for giving up all rights to the song. Black chose [...] "Friday", as [...] "the other song was about adult love – I haven't experienced that yet. I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> my personality in that song."

The trailer was released in November 1993, accompanying The Three Musketeers in theaters, as only a third of The Lion King had been completed. Audience reaction was enthusiastic, causing Hahn to have some initial concerns as he became afraid of not living up to the expectations raised by the preview.

The band recorded on their own time with their own resources, which both provided comfort {{and a sense of}} nervousness to the group. They did not sit down and preconceive the album as a change in style, but rather relaxed and took their time writing it. [...] "We just <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like we were just taking our time and just kinda living life and not worrying about too much other than getting together and making music," [...] remarked Taylor.

When I was told of the characterization of ‘Kalabhairava’, I had an impression of a young, passionate soldier and naturally it had to have a great body and an authoritative voice. So, we also worked on it. We actually went to Rajasthan and observed the local culture and their way of dressing, we researched a lot about their costumes, history and great personalities 400 years ago and planned it accordingly."
