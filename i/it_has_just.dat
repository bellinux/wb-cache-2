500|$|Apart {{from a few}} early attempts, Hebel's {{began his}} {{literary}} work {{near the end of}} the 18th century. After returning to Karlsruhe from a trip to Wiesental in 1799, he began to write Allemannische Gedichte, inspired by a longing for his home. (Allemannische is the spelling he used; normally <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> one [...] "l".) The 32 poems [...] "for friends of the rural way of life" [...] were written in Alemannic, the local dialect of Wiesental. Hebel could not find a Basel publisher willing to produce the book in Alemannic, and the collection was only published in 1803 by Philip Macklot in Karlsruhe, after Hebel and his friends managed to collect enough advance subscriptions. The first edition was published anonymously, possibly because Hebel was concerned about getting a rustic image.|$|E

Forward Unto Dawn consists of five 15-minute episodes released weekly starting on October 5, 2012, and was later released as a single film on DVD and Blu-ray and was later put on Netflix in 2013. The series was produced as a marketing effort for the video game Halo 4 intended to widen the audience of the Halo series and as a stepping stone to a potential Halo film. It was written by Aaron Helbing and Todd Helbing, and directed by Stewart Hendler. Forward Unto Dawn was shot in Vancouver over 25 days in May 2012 on a budget just under [...] <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> under 500 shots with computer generated imagery, approximately a quarter of what a feature film would have, but the visual effects received praise from reviewers.|$|E

The brighter component has been classed as a Delta Scuti variable star, though this view is not universal. The components are main sequence stars of spectral types B9V and A3V.

[...] Herald-Tribune critic Walter Kerr noted that [...] "Rodgers and Hammerstein have come perilously close to writing a show-without-a-show." [...] George Jean Nathan of the Journal American stated that [...] "Hammerstein's book has the effect of hanging idly around waiting for an idea to come to him." [...] Robert Coleman of the Daily Mirror noted, [...] "Having set new high standards for musicals throughout the world, Rodgers and Hammerstein dipped into the lower drawer of their desk for Me and Juliet. It proved a big disappointment for this dyed-in-the-wool R. & H. fan." [...] John Chapman of the Daily News commented, [...] "It is at its most interesting when Jo Mielziner's sets are in motion".

500|$|Doe joined Conference Premier club Weymouth on 1 July 2007, {{along with}} Swindon Town youth {{teammate}} Jon Stewart, where {{he signed a}} one-year contract. His debut for Weymouth was in the 3–0 home win during a pre-season friendly against League Two side Bournemouth on 17 July. He made his competitive debut for his new club on 15 September in the 3–1 away win at Droylsden, replacing Conal Platt as a substitute in the 65th minute. Doe's first start for Weymouth was against Torquay United on 25 September, in their 3–2 away defeat. His first goal for the club was scored on 26 January 2008, away at Rushden & Diamonds, as Weymouth were defeated 3–2. Paolo Vernazza took a free kick in the 25th minute after Stuart Beavon was fouled just outside the penalty area by Curtis Osano. Doe scored with a header, which took a slight deflection as the ball crossed the goal line. During Weymouth's 2–1 away defeat on 1 March to Halifax Town, Doe was controversially sent off three minutes into stoppage time. He was sent off for a tackle on Andy Campbell, but manager John Hollins claimed [...] "there {{is no doubt that}} Scott got the ball". Weymouth finished the season in 18th position, defying relegation, with Doe ending the 2007–08 season having made 33 appearances in the Conference, scoring once. Doe won the [...] "Supporters Player of The Year" [...] award, describing it as [...] "the best thing in the World". He admitted he did not expect to play more than 15 games during the season, saying [...] "when I first came to the club I thought I might play 15 games throughout the whole season but I have ended up playing over twice that and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>just</b> been fantastic" [...] stated Doe.|$|E
