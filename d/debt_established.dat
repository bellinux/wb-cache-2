50|$|After {{serving as}} a {{minister}} at various institutions, such as the Summerfield Methodist Church of Brooklyn, Sims was approached to become chancellor of Syracuse University in 1881. During his tenure, Sims pushed for the university to pay off <b>debts,</b> <b>establish</b> endowments, and expand the university with new buildings. Holden Observatory was the first building completed under Sims' building fund, and Sims likewise oversaw {{the construction of the}} John Crouse Memorial College for Women (now Crouse College). He retired as chancellor in 1893.|$|R
50|$|Financial health {{management}} first aims {{to help people}} get out of immediate <b>debt</b> with an <b>established</b> <b>debt</b> relief method. In the case of FHM using debt settlement, a client makes monthly savings to an account until the balance rises high enough {{to reach a settlement}} with a creditor. The financial {{health management}} company would then negotiate a settlement deal with the creditor. The debt is then paid off from the saved funds.|$|R
50|$|Pease first ran for {{governor}} in 1851 but withdrew from the race {{two weeks before the}} election. He was elected in each of the next two elections, 1853 and 1855. As governor, he paid off the state <b>debt</b> and <b>established</b> the financial foundation that the state would later use to finance its schools and colleges.|$|R
50|$|However, she met strong {{opposition}} from a hard core of local councillors, town clerks {{and members of}} the public (four councillors and the town clerk resigned in response to her election), and they often disrupted meetings and orchestrated opposition to her every proposal. It is noted by some critics that she did not help her own cause by being 'tactless' and 'dictatorial' in her manner. Only a year later, she was defeated roundly at the polls. Even her opponents had to concede however, that she had been very effective during her short tenure, having liquidated the borough <b>debt,</b> <b>established</b> a sinking fund, reorganised the fire brigade, upgraded roads, footpaths and sanitation, and having personally lobbied the government to authorise the reopening of the Waikaraka cemetery.|$|E
5000|$|Australia had accrued {{substantial}} debt, {{mainly from}} Britain's independent banking sector, {{by the late}} 1920s - {{partly as a result}} of Prime Minister Bruce's [...] "Men, Money, Markets" [...] economic strategy, and partly because of the large war <b>debt</b> <b>established</b> during World War I. After the Wall Street Crash, the United States called in many of its World War I loans, including many from the UK, which, in turn called in its own loans from Australia. Australia had accumulated such massive debt that it was unable to repay even the interest on its loans. To avert total bankruptcy with the onset of the Australia's Great Depression, Australia asked Britain for a deferment of payment on its war debts. To determine whether or not this was a viable financial option, the Bank of England sent Niemeyer to give an assessment of Australia and its financial situation. He came by arrangement with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and agreement by Prime Minister James Scullin.|$|E
40|$|Another satire on Andrew Jackson's {{conflict}} with French king Louis Philippe over French reparations due the United States under the Treaty of 1831. The artist blames vice-president Van Buren for escalation of anti-French {{feeling in the}} Administration to the verge of war. In the center Jackson, holding a sack of 25 million francs (the amount of French <b>debt</b> <b>established</b> by the treaty), dances to a tune played by "First Fiddle" Van Buren and the Cabinet orchestra. Louis Philippe {{falls to the floor}} at left. Jackson: "Par l'Eternel! Louis Philippe, je jouerai l'enfer et Thomas avec vous! D [...] n it Martin give us a War-dance! Whoop!!" Louis Philippe: "Nom de Dieu! I try de double shuffle wis dis d [...] n old Jackson, & he put me on my back supristi!!" Van Buren: "'I am the boy for bewitching 'em!' Forward and back two!!" Various other foreign heads of state and significant persons (identified in the lower margin) witness the scene, some commenting on it. The words given to Baron de Rothschild, for instance, express the anti-Semitic, anti-bank sentiments of the artist, "By Moses and de Profits, I am King of de Jews!" Weitenkampf records three different "issues" of the print, but describes only one, signed by Edward Williams Clay and published by Robinson in February 1836 at 48 Courtlandt St. The Library's impression has a variant imprint, listing the address as 52 Courtlandt St., and lacking Clay's monogram.

5|$|After {{putting on}} the crown, Finn becomes {{corrupted}} by its power, going mad. He attacks the Destiny Gang—who his family owed a <b>debt</b> as <b>established</b> in the previous episode—and put out the fires that they started, but his uncontrolled power causes the mutagenic bomb that Simon stopped to explode, destroying the surrounding area. Jake, however, falls into a mutagenic puddle and is mutated into a creature similar to the Lich, which attacks Finn.|$|R

25|$|Following recognition, Brooke {{expanded}} the kingdom territory {{at the expense}} of Brunei by reducing the territory of the latter. Several major rebellions occurred against his rule, causing him to be plagued by debt incurred in countering the rebellions, and the sluggish economic situation at the time. His nephew, Charles Brooke, succeeded James and normalised the situation by improving the economy, reducing government <b>debts</b> and <b>establishing</b> public infrastructure. The kingdom was made a British protectorate in 1888.|$|R
50|$|The United States Congress had {{enacted the}} Legal Tender Acts during the U.S. Civil War when {{southern}} Democrats were {{absent from the}} Congress, and thus their Jacksonian hard money views were underrepresented. After the war, the Supreme Court ruled on the Legal Tender Cases to determine {{the constitutionality of the}} use of greenbacks. The 1870 case Hepburn v. Griswold found unconstitutional the use of greenbacks when applied to <b>debts</b> <b>established</b> prior to the First Legal Tender Act as the five Democrats on the Court, Nelson, Grier, Clifford, Field, and Chase, ruled against the Civil War legislation in a 5-3 decision. Secretary Chase had become Chief Justice of the United States and a Democrat, and spearheaded the decision invalidating his own actions during the war. However, Grier retired from the Court, and President Grant appointed two new Republicans, Strong and Bradley, who joined the three sitting Republicans, Swayne, Miller, and Davis, to reverse Hepburn, 5-4, in the 1871 cases Knox v. Lee and Parker v. Davis. During 1884, the Court, controlled 8-1 by Republicans, granted the federal government very broad power to issue Legal Tender paper through the case Juilliard v. Greenman, with only the lone remaining Democrat, Field, dissenting.|$|R
50|$|Late in the war, Congress asked {{individual}} colonies {{to equip}} their own troops, and pay upkeep {{for their own}} soldiers in the Continental Army. When the war ended, the United States had spent $37 million {{at the national level}} and $114 million at the state level. The United States finally solved its debt problems in the 1790s when Alexander Hamilton founded the First Bank of the United States in order to pay off ear <b>debts</b> and <b>establish</b> good national credit.|$|R
5000|$|The Pakistani {{government}} made progress {{in its efforts}} to prevent human trafficking. The Punjab provincial government continued implementation of its $1.4 million project, Elimination of Bonded Labour in Brick Kilns (launched in 2008). To date, this project helped nearly 6,000 bonded labourers obtain Computerized National Identification Cards, in collaboration with the government National Database and Registration Authority. It has also provided $140,000 in no-interest loans to help free labourers from <b>debt</b> and <b>established</b> 60 on-site schools that educated over 1,500 children of brick kiln labourers.|$|R

5000|$|In {{sovereign}} financial systems, banks {{can create}} money but these [...] "horizontal" [...] transactions do not increase {{net financial assets}} as assets are offset by liabilities. “The balance sheet of {{the government does not}} include any domestic monetary instrument on its asset side; it owns no money. All monetary instruments issued by the government are on its liability side and are created and destroyed with spending and taxing/bond offerings, respectively.” In addition to deficit spending, valuation effects e.g. growth in stock price can increase net financial assets. In MMT, [...] "vertical" [...] money (see below) enters circulation through government spending. Taxation and its legal tender power to discharge <b>debt</b> <b>establish</b> the fiat money as currency, giving it value by creating demand for it {{in the form of a}} private tax obligation that must be met. In addition, fines, fees and licenses create demand for the currency. This can be a currency issued by the government, or a foreign currency such as the euro. An ongoing tax obligation, in concert with private confidence and acceptance of the currency, maintains its value. Because the government can issue its own currency at will, MMT maintains that the level of taxation relative to government spending (the government's deficit spending or budget surplus) is in reality a policy tool that regulates inflation and unemployment, and not a means of funding the government's activities by itself.|$|R

50|$|As {{chair of}} the Assembly Budget Committee, Bob oversaw the shaping of a state {{spending}} plan in 2013 that marked a new beginning for California's fiscal future. When he {{was sworn in as}} a freshman legislator in December 2008, the State faced a looming fiscal emergency and a state deficit of $40 billion. In the years that followed, Blumenfield would deliver three on-time balanced budgets—a feat not seen since the mid-1980s. Blumenfield delivered a spending blueprint that maintained fiscal responsibility, tracked the governor’s conservative revenue estimates, paid down $5.2 billion in <b>debt</b> and <b>established</b> a rainy-day fund for emergencies.|$|R
50|$|Petitions {{circulated}} {{in favour of}} American annexation. The first, in 1867, was addressed to Queen Victoria, demanding that the British government assume the colony's <b>debts</b> and <b>establish</b> a steamer link, or allow the colony to join the U.S. In 1869, a second petition was addressed to President Ulysses S. Grant, asking him to negotiate American annexation of the territory from Britain. It was delivered to Grant by Vincent Colyer, Indian Commissioner for Alaska, on December 29, 1869. Both petitions were signed by {{only a small fraction}} of the colony's population, and British Columbia was ultimately admitted as a Canadian province in 1871.|$|R

60|$|The {{correspondence}} {{was carried}} no further, for not even can a Mrs. Carbuncle exact payment {{of such a}} <b>debt</b> in any <b>established</b> court; but she inveighed bitterly against the meanness of Mrs. Smith, telling the story openly, and never feeling that she told it against herself. In her set it was generally thought that she had done quite right.|$|R
50|$|With charge-offs (debts {{written-off}} by banks) increasing, banks <b>established</b> <b>debt</b> settlement departments staffed with {{personnel who}} were authorized {{to negotiate with}} defaulted cardholders to reduce the outstanding balances in hopes to recover funds {{that would otherwise be}} lost if the cardholder filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Typical settlements ranged between 25% and 65% of the outstanding balance.|$|R
25|$|The Ursulines {{being in}} great <b>debt,</b> Wheelwright <b>established</b> much-needed {{financial}} stability for the Order, primarily by encouraging the nuns to pursue Amerindian embroidery, using Native materials of birch bark, deer skin, moose and porcupine hair to create images of saints. Despite being an arduous task, the moose hair requiring constant rethreading, this art became a commercial success, and many embroideries {{were sold to}} English soldiers and tourists. The Ursulines' economic self-sufficiency helped provide for their community services to French and Native inhabitants, and contributed to their independence from reform-minded bishops. In {{the latter half of}} the 18th century, the Ursuline school increasingly hosted British students, among them the Brookes' daughters.|$|R
50|$|A {{mortgage}} bond, as per Thienhaus v Metje & Ziegler, is {{an instrument}} of hypothecation, {{a record of the}} mortgage agreement, a record of the principal debt and a <b>debt</b> instrument. It <b>establishes</b> the mortgagee’s right of mortgage (ius hypothecarium). Registration does not depend on the validity of the underlying causa, as South Africa applies the abstract system of transfer of real rights.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} three proposals {{intended to}} enhance liquidity {{in the market}} for U. S.

The proposals would enhance liquidity by improving the substitutability of identical and very nearly identical Treasury liabilities, and by increasing the integration of the markets for bills, notes, bonds and STRIPS. The proposals would be complementary to, rather than a substitute for, the initiative to buy back outstanding debt announced in August 1999. ...|$|R

25|$|In 1871, Virginia enacted {{legislation}} exchanging {{two-thirds of}} its outstanding bonds for new debt, and issuing certificates for the remaining one-third of the debt (which the state assumed would be paid by West Virginia) guaranteeing payment once the state's debt dispute with West Virginia was resolved. Virginia enacted legislation in 1879 reducing the interest rate on the outstanding one-third of the debt, {{but was unable to}} discharge the debt due to bondholder resistance. A second sale in 1882 also failed, and in 1892 Virginia issued new bonds to pay off the old one-third <b>debt.</b> Virginia <b>established</b> a commission in 1894 to negotiate with West Virginia over the debt, and in 1900 authorized the commission to accept the 1871 certificates from bondholders with the promise to pay once negotiations with West Virginia concluded.|$|R

Specifically, we examine and propose some proxies for debt, taxes and non-debt tax shields, since taxation and debt are the focus of our research. This is a key issue since the specific explanatory variables used in any study significantly influence tax effects; omitted variable biases are indeed quantitatively important (Feld et al. 2013).|$|R
