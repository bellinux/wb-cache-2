40|$|Résumé de l'ouvrage) In {{the first}} volume of this long-anticipated {{collection}} by Moessner and Tiede, seventeen leading scholars of antiquity present an amazing "sea change" of opinion that Luke is indeed the interpreter of Israel. The book represents an unprecedented international consensus that the Hellenistic author Luke composed a carefully crafted narrative in two parts to claim Jesus of Nazareth as Israel's true heritage and enduring legacy to the world. Part One explores the nature of Luke's prologues and his intention to write a narrative of "events brought to fruition," using the narrative conventions and audience expectations of the Greco-Roman milieu. Part Two illuminates the relation of Luke's second "volume" to the first by inquiring about the consistency and coherence of his narrative-thematic strategies in retelling the story of Israel's legacy of "the Christ. " Whether Luke completed Acts, the larger role of Paul and, most significantly, the meaning of Israel by the end of Acts are approached from new perspectives and charged with provocative insights. In addition to the volume editors, the contributors include L. Alexander, D. Schmidt, V. Robbins, C. Thornton, R. Pervo, W. Kurz, C. Holladay, G. Sterling, D. Balch, E. Plmacher, Charles H.

International Society for Horticultural Science, Wageningen, 35 - 41 In insect-pollinated plants, {{the effects of}} habitat {{fragmentation}} on gene flow are mediated through the foraging behaviour of pollinators, which will be modified by the relative attractiveness and density of resource patches and the relative constancy of pollinators to a target species and/or patch. Bee-mediated gene flow between groups of self-incompatible plants was quantified using five selection lines of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) with isoenzyme markers. The objectives were to investigate whether pollen flow and consequent gene flow reflected bee patch constancy and how pollen flow varied with distance and vegetation between donor and recipient plants. Groups of five clover plants were positioned on grass/herb patches, sown within a field of barley. Each group of plants contained one clover line. Seed paternity in three cohorts of inflorescences was determined using starch gel electrophoresis. Most (92 %) of the sampled seed was sired by plants from the same group as the recipient plant. There was a significant negative relationship between pollen flow and distance between plant groups, and pollen flow declined significantly over time. There was some evidence that a strip of barley between the grass/herb patches acted {{as a barrier to}} pollen flow. In conclusion, pollen and gene flow reflected the bee patch constancy observed in a previous experiment, and short distances of separation (26 m) between plant groups led to restricted bee-mediated pollen flow.

40|$|In {{preparation}} for a thorough study of the Book of Acts, it is worth-while {{to take stock of}} the resources available. For a book which is as pivotal as Acts to our practice of NT Christianity, it is deplorable that there are so few really exceptional commentaries available. Hopefully, this situation is beginning to improve. There are two new books which have just been completed on Acts. The first, by J. Stott (InterVarsity, 1990) is already available. It is written primarily in narrative form and deals with the material by paragraph rather than verse by verse. The second, which will be out in December, is by S. Kistemaker in the New Testament Commentary (Baker, 1990). We look forward to this one because of the thorough approach and careful scholarship. E. Ellis calls it a "’meat and potatoes ’ book with solid exposition. " Perhaps the best two commentaries available on Acts are those by F. F. Bruce (Eerdmans, 1954) and <b>I.</b> <b>H.</b> <b>Marshall</b> (Tyndale, 1980). Bruce in fact, has two commentaries on Acts: one for the student of Greek and one for the English reader (NIC). The NIC volume is now available in a newly revised edition (Eerdmans, 1989). This work is valuable not only because of its solid exposition and theological insight, but because of its attention to historical details which are helpful to the Similarly, Marshall's commentary is helpful for the same reasons. is part of the Tyndale New Testament Commentary series and E. M. Blaiklock's work in that series, which was too brief to justice to a lengthy book such as Acts. Other current works which are worthy of note include E. F. Harrison (Acts: The Expanding Church). This work has an especially good introduction to Acts which would be appropriate for an inter-mediate student of this subject. This commentary, however, deals wit...|$|E
