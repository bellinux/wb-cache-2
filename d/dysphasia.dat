25|$|An {{assortment}} of neurological {{effects can be}} observed in 75-90% of individuals of any age with clinically observable B12 deficiency. Cobalamin deficiency manifestations are apparent in the abnormalities of the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, optic nerves, and cerebrum. These abnormalities involve a progressive degeneration of myelin, and may be expressed behaviourally through reports of sensory disturbances in the extremities, or motor disturbances, such as gait ataxia. Combined myelopathy and neuropathy are prevalent within a large percentage of cases. Cognitive changes may range from loss of concentration to memory loss, disorientation, and dementia. All of these symptoms may present with or without additional mood changes. Mental symptoms are extremely variable, and include mild disorders of mood, mental slowness, and memory defect. Memory defect encompasses symptoms of confusion, severe agitation and depression, delusions and paranoid behaviour, visual and auditory hallucinations, urinary and fecal incontinence in the absence of overt spinal lesions, <b>dysphasia,</b> violent maniacal behaviour, and epilepsy. It has been suggested that mental symptoms could be related to a decrease in cerebral metabolism, as caused by the state of deficiency. All of these symptoms may present with or without additional mood changes.|$|E

Other general {{symptoms}} of Behçet's disease are also present among parenchymal NBD patients such as fever, headache, genital ulcers, genital scars, and skin lesions. When the brainstem is affected, ophthalmoparesis, cranial neuropathy, and cerebellar or pyramidal dysfunction may be observed.

50|$|Transcortical {{motor aphasia}} (TMoA), {{also known as}} commissural <b>dysphasia</b> and white matter <b>dysphasia,</b> results from damage, {{typically}} due to cerebrovascular accident (CVA), in the anterior superior frontal lobe of the language-dominant hemisphere. The left hemisphere usually performs language functions, although left-handed individuals {{have been shown to}} perform language functions with both their right and left hemispheres. Damage in the watershed region does not directly damage the areas of the brain involved in language production or comprehension; instead, the damage isolates these areas {{from the rest of the}} brain. Due to damage in areas of the frontal lobe, executive functions related to language use are often affected in individuals with TMoA. Relevant executive functions include activating language responses and controlling syntax (grammar) and narrative discourse, which can lead to difficulties forming complex sentences, choosing which words to use appropriately, and initiating speech in conversation. The extent of brain damage will impact how much language functioning is impaired (i.e. damage deep to the frontal lobe and/or damage across multiple regions will greatly impair language). Right hemiparesis, which is right-sided paralysis, may occur along with TMoA if the lesion in the anterior frontal lobe is large enough and extends into the posterior frontal lobe. There are also other forms of aphasias that are a result of TMoA. Adynamic aphasia is one example; it is a form of TMoA characterized by sparse speech. Adynamic aphasia has normal spontaneous speech due to the fact that when new concepts are introduced by external stimuli, spontaneous speech improves. This is a result of executive functioning in the frontal lobe.|$|E

40|$|Deep <b>dysphasia</b> is a {{language}} impairment that {{is defined by}} impaired repetition. In this study we report a bilingual Turkish-English patient BRB who shows many {{of the features of}} deep <b>dysphasia</b> in both languages. BRB was given lexical and non-lexical processing tasks including oral reading, repetition and writing to dictation manipulating several variables (AoA, regularity, imageability, grammatical class) in Turkish (L 1) and English (L 2). BRB was also asked to translate orally and in writing both high and low frequency and high and low imageability words from L 1 to L 2 and from L 2 to L 1. Significant main effects of language and task as well as interactions between language and task were observed e. g., BRB’s repetition, reading and writing was better in L 1 than L 2 object naming was better in L 2 than L 1 but only with high imageability words. We argue that impaired language processing in deep <b>dysphasia</b> arises from the under-activation of phonological representations. We propose that current models of deep <b>dysphasia</b> require modification to explain bilingual deep <b>dysphasia</b> and also interpret BRB’s performance using a model of bilingual lexical processing...|$|E

40|$|Deep <b>dysphasia</b> is a {{relatively}} rare subcategory of aphasia, characterized by word repetition impairment and profound auditory-verbal short-term memory (AVSTM) limitation. Accuracy of word repetition is better for words than nonwords (lexicality effect) and better for high-image than low-image words (imageability effect). The cardinal feature of deep <b>dysphasia</b> is the occurrence of semantic errors in single word repetition (Howard & Franklin, 1988). Phonological <b>dysphasia</b> shares all of these features except that semantic errors in repetition appear in repetition of multiple words and sentences. Thus, it has been proposed that these two ‘syndromes’ are not distinct, but actually are based on an impairment of auditory-verbal STM that can vary by severity, leading to deep <b>dysphasia</b> when severe and phonological <b>dysphasia</b> when mild (Martin, Saffran & Dell, 1996; Ablinger, Ablel & Huber, 2008). First, we report a single case treatment study of a person whose pattern of word repetition performance {{was consistent with the}} continuum of phonological-deep dysphasia: poor repetition of nonwords, imageability effects in repetition of single and multiple words and semantic errors in repetition of multiple word utterances. Differences in processing abstract (i. e., low imageability) versus concrete (i. e., high image) have been considered recently in aphasic treatment protocols (Kiran, Sandberg & Abbott, 2009). Here we test the effects of a theoretically motivated treatment that manipulates the semantic cohesiveness of low imageability (i. e., abstract) -low frequency (LI-LF) words to improve access to and short-term retention of LI words in deep-phonological <b>dysphasia.</b> Following presentation of the treatment case study, we describe an experimental protocol to determine if this approach of increasing imageability of abstract words through syntactic and semantic contexts can be extended to other individuals who present along the deep [...] phonological <b>dysphasia</b> continuum...|$|E
