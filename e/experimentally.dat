5|$|PrPSc <b>experimentally</b> {{transmitted}} {{between one}} species and another results in PrPSc with the amino-acid {{sequence of the}} recipient species, suggesting that nucleic acid-mediated replication of the donor agent does not occur.|$|E
5|$|Several {{isotopes}} of bismuth {{with short}} half-lives occur within the radioactive disintegration chains of actinium, radium, and thorium, and more have been synthesized <b>experimentally.</b> Bismuth-213 {{is also found}} on the decay chain of uranium-233.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the proteome of E. coli. By 2006, 1,627 (38%) of the 4,237 open reading frames (ORFs) had been identified <b>experimentally.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} for explanations involving dietary conservatism, in which predators avoid new prey {{because it is}} an unknown quantity; this is a long-lasting effect. Dietary conservatism has been demonstrated <b>experimentally</b> in some species of birds.|$|E
5|$|A {{graduate}} of the University of Göttingen, Goeppert Mayer wrote her doctorate on the theory of possible two-photon absorption by atoms. At the time, the chances of <b>experimentally</b> verifying her thesis seemed remote, but {{the development of the}} laser permitted this. Today, the unit for the two-photon absorption cross section is named the Goeppert Mayer (GM) unit.|$|E
5|$|Although {{humans are}} the only known natural hosts of poliovirus, monkeys can be <b>experimentally</b> {{infected}} and they have long been used to study poliovirus. In 1990–91, a small animal model of poliomyelitis was developed by two laboratories. Mice were engineered to express a human receptor to poliovirus (hPVR).|$|E
5|$|Although it has {{not been}} shown <b>experimentally</b> if the spores can survive the passage through an animal's {{digestive}} tract, the regular presence of Cyathus on cow or horse manure strongly suggest that this is true. Alternatively, the hard outer casing of peridioles ejected from splash cups may simply disintegrate over time, eventually releasing the spores within.|$|E
5|$|At present, hang baits {{are illegal}} off Isla Guadalupe and reputable dive {{operators}} {{do not use}} them. Operators in South Africa and Australia continue to use hang baits and pinniped decoys. In South Australia, playing rock music recordings underwater, including the AC/DC album Back in Black has also been used <b>experimentally</b> to attract sharks.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for a {{particular}} protein having evolved by a fission and fusion mechanism can be provided by observing the halves of the permutation as independent polypeptides in related species, or by demonstrating <b>experimentally</b> that the two halves can function as separate polypeptides.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{successful}} use of superheating on other Drummond classes, Robert Urie <b>experimentally</b> fitted a superheated boiler to No.126 in December 1920, {{together with an}} extended smokebox and larger cylinders. The additional weight of the new boiler raised the centre of gravity of the locomotive, thereby adding to problems of instability on faster main line trains, whilst simultaneously preventing its use on many branch lines. As a result, no further examples were fitted, and No.126 was eventually broken up for spare parts in 1937. In 1931 No. 672 was <b>experimentally</b> fitted with the Strowger-Hudd Automatic Warning System, but the equipment was not adopted by the Southern Railway and the equipment later removed.|$|E
5|$|Gas bubbles with a radius {{greater than}} 1 micron should float {{to the surface}} of a {{standing}} liquid, whereas smaller ones should dissolve rapidly due to surface tension. The Tiny Bubble Group has been able to resolve this apparent paradox by developing and <b>experimentally</b> verifying a new model for stable gas nuclei.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, a gas of {{rubidium}} atoms cooled down to {{a temperature}} of 170 nK was used to <b>experimentally</b> realize the Bose–Einstein condensate, a novel state of matter originally predicted by S. N. Bose and Albert Einstein, wherein {{a large number of}} atoms occupy one quantum state.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{required}} serpin, the protease that it normally would regulate is over-active, leading to pathologies. Consequently, simple deficiency of a serpin (e.g. a null mutation) can result in disease. Gene knockouts, particularly in mice, are used <b>experimentally</b> to determine the normal functions of serpins by the effect of their absence.|$|E
5|$|Isolated vacancy is {{the most}} studied defect in diamond, both <b>experimentally</b> and theoretically. Its most {{important}} practical property is optical absorption, like in the color centers, which gives diamond green, or sometimes even green–blue color (in pure diamond). The characteristic feature of this absorption {{is a series of}} sharp lines called GR1-8, where GR1 line at 741nm {{is the most}} prominent and important.|$|E
5|$|Non-SI units whose {{values in}} SI units must be {{obtained}} <b>experimentally</b> (Table 7). This list includes various units of measure used in atomic and nuclear physics and in astronomy {{such as the}} dalton, the electron mass, the electron volt, the astronomical unit, the solar mass, {{and a number of}} other units of measure that are well-established, but dependent on experimentally-determined physical quantities.|$|E
5|$|Plasmodium knowlesi {{has been}} known since the 1930s in Asian macaque monkeys and as <b>experimentally</b> capable of infecting humans. In 1965 a natural human {{infection}} was reported in a U.S. soldier returning from the Pahang Jungle of the Malaysian peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Sands {{went to the}} California Institute of Technology (Caltech), {{where he}} helped build and operate a 1.5 GeV {{electron}} synchrotron. He {{was the first to}} demonstrate, both theoretically and <b>experimentally,</b> the role of quantum effects in electron particle accelerators. He also studied beam instabilities, wake fields, beam-cavity interactions, and other phenomena.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty's {{informal}} approach {{changed when}} {{a branch of}} the Naval Research Laboratory was established at Leamington Spa under Commander James Yunge-Bateman to test ship camouflage schemes <b>experimentally.</b> Painted models were floated in a large tank and examined against different backgrounds, using theater lamps to simulate varying lighting conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{energies}} {{between the}} Van Hove singularities {{depend on the}} nanotube structure. Thus by varying this structure, one can tune the optoelectronic properties of carbon nanotube. Such fine tuning has been <b>experimentally</b> demonstrated using UV illumination of polymer-dispersed CNTs.|$|E
5|$|The {{interaction}} with virtual particles also explains the small (about 0.1%) deviation of the intrinsic magnetic {{moment of the}} electron from the Bohr magneton (the anomalous magnetic moment). The extraordinarily precise agreement of this predicted difference with the <b>experimentally</b> determined value is viewed {{as one of the}} great achievements of quantum electrodynamics.|$|E
5|$|The {{operations}} of Ars Technica are funded primarily by online advertising, {{and it has}} offered a paid subscription service since 2001. The website generated controversy in 2010, when it <b>experimentally</b> prevented readers who used advertisement-blocking software from viewing the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{simulations}} run on Folding@home {{are used}} in conjunction with laboratory experiments, but researchers can use them to study how folding in vitro differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe <b>experimentally.</b> For example, in 2011 Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a ribosomal exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process. Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical denaturants to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein's refolding, {{and it is difficult to}} <b>experimentally</b> determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of ProteinL, and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.|$|E
5|$|While {{the popular}} {{consensus}} is that olfaction {{is very important for}} hunting, two studies that <b>experimentally</b> investigated the role of olfactory, auditory, and visual cues found that visual cues are the most important ones for hunting in red foxes and coyotes.|$|E
25|$|Thirteen {{isotopes}} {{have been}} <b>experimentally</b> observed undergoing two-neutrino double beta decay or double electron capture. The table below contains nuclides {{with the latest}} <b>experimentally</b> measured half-lives, as of December 2016.|$|E
25|$|Sheep {{and goats}} die acutely without any {{previous}} clinical signs. Only elevation of eosinophils and slight increase of γ-globulins {{were observed in}} <b>experimentally</b> infected sheep. Recently, several changes in biochemical and haematological profile have been documented in <b>experimentally</b> infected goats. The significant increase of GLDH (glutamate dehydrogenase) was recorded from 14 weeks after infection in goats <b>experimentally</b> infected with F. magna.|$|E
