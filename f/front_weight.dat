50|$|Front-wheel drive gives more {{interior}} space since the powertrain {{is a single}} unit contained in the engine compartment of the vehicle {{and there is no}} need to devote {{interior space}} for a driveshaft tunnel or rear differential, increasing the volume available for passengers and cargo. There are some exceptions to this as rear engine designs do not take away interior space (see Porsche 911, and Volkswagen Beetle). It also has fewer components overall and thus lower weight. The direct connection between engine and transaxle reduces the mass and mechanical inertia of the drivetrain compared to a rear-wheel-drive vehicle with a similar engine and transmission, allowing greater fuel economy. In front-wheel-drive cars the mass of the drivetrain is placed over the driven wheels and thus moves the centre of gravity farther forward than a comparable rear-wheel-drive layout, improving traction and directional stability on wet, snowy, or icy surfaces. Front-wheel-drive cars, with a <b>front</b> <b>weight</b> bias, tend to understeer at the limit which, according to Saab engineer Gunnar Larsson, is easier since it makes instinct correct in avoiding terminal oversteer, and less prone to result in fishtailing or a spin.|$|E
5000|$|The Lancer Evolution WRC {{is powered}} by the same 1996 cc 4G63 engine {{that has been used}} in its sports and rally cars since the 1980s, in this {{iteration}} producing [...] at 5500 rpm and 540 Nm at 3500 rpm. The car debuted at the 2001 Rallye San Remo, after a relatively short development (Ralliart couldn't introduce the Lancer WRC later because of a contract they made with the FIA in 1999, which allowed them to run the old specification Lancers). Despite calling it Lancer, it was based on its sister-model Cedia. The WRC rules allowed more freedom in most areas of the car, therefore the engineers were able to make changes to the car they couldn't do to the older Group A Lancers. These changes included modifications to the engine and its surroundings (lighter internal parts, more rearward tilt to optimize the <b>front</b> <b>weight</b> distribution, new turbo and new exhaust system), but the most significant change was made to the suspensions: now both the front and rear suspensions were MacPhersons, and also bigger wheel arches were implanted, allowing more suspension travel. However, the drivetrain remained the same as before, and when Tommi Mäkinen left the team at the end of 2001, the new drivers couldn't get on with this special transmission, which required an aggressive left-foot braking approach. The original Evo WRC (sometimes referred to as Step1) was replaced with the Step2 from 2002 Finland onwards.|$|E

40|$|Polyvinyl {{chloride}} (PVC) {{is commonly}} used for drinking water pipes. Although PVC is resistant to natural environmental conditions, organic solvents may attack the pipe wall causing swelling, softening, water lines failure and drinking water pollution. Permeation is linked to underground storage tanks and random accidental spills of organic solvents or fuel derivates. Although rare, several cases have been reported. This thesis was developed {{with the idea of}} increasing the understanding of permeation process, developing new laboratory methods for permeation testing, and helping pipe companies in assess about pipe selection in zones of high risk. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRs) was selected as the methodology. NIR is already used in both organic solvents and polymer fields for discriminative and quantitative analysis of organic compounds. The objective of the first study was to track the permeation of PVC pipes by two major organic solvents (toluene and benzene) at different concentrations. The development of principal least squares (PLS) calibrations with NIR spectra and reference data provided by the Civil Engineering lab in Iowa State University gave accurate models with the following statistic values: R 2 above 90, Relative performance determinant (RPD) higher than 3, and standard errors of prediction (SEP) values similar to the standard error of the laboratory (SEL). These models could predict the permeation state of studied pipes in mm of solvent moving <b>front,</b> <b>weight</b> gain or days under permeation. The second study lead to the correlation of the pipe permeation susceptibility in pure toluene in mm/h 1 / 2 to the pipe spectra. Spectra differences from several pipe brands and sizes were modeled with locally weighted regression (LWR) and resulted in several models which can predict with accuracy (RPD above 5) the pipe susceptibility to permeation. In summary, NIR is a suitable tool for permeation studies and may contribute to the better understanding of permeation...|$|E
40|$|The cars {{of today}} {{tend to be}} quite heavy in the front {{meanwhile}} light in the rear, mainly due {{to the location of}} the engine compartment and powertrain {{in the front of the}} car. If the <b>front</b> <b>weight</b> of the car could be reduced, the car could be more balanced and also the most discussed parameter for cars, namely emission of carbon dioxide, can be reduced,. This study aims to investigate how to introduce a composite materials in the bonnet, with the focus on reducing the weight, while meeting important demands on the bonnet. In this study it was chosen to consider the demands related to pedestrian safety and the stiffness of the bonnet. Pedestrian safety is a complex demand saying that the bonnet should be able to absorb a certain amount of energy from a head impact without getting the pedestrian injured. From an extensive literature study three potential material structures were found to be appropriate regarding impact resistance and flexural stiffness. Carbon fibre reinforced epoxy (CFRP) /Polyvinylchloride (PVC) foam sandwich material, aluminium/polycarbonate sandwich material and Hybrix micro-sandwich material are the materials explored in the literature study to be appropriate candidates for the demands chosen in this study. As seen in recent research based on simulations of impact resistance, some materials are especially interesting. Considering those more interesting materials, it was decided to purchase and build beam sections of each material sharing the same geometry to perform impact tests in the drop tower facility at Volvo Cars Corporation (VCC) in Gothenburg. Of those three materials selected only two materials could be compiled due to the time limit of the project. The material excluded from testing was the Al/PC sandwich material. In additional to the potential stiff and impact resistant materials, also an aluminium beam was built sharing the same geometry as the other materials and the impact resistance and stiffness of samples were measured and compared with the aluminium material used in the current bonnets at VCC. Additional to the impact tests, also a three point bending test was performed on the different materials samples according to VCC and ASTM standards, in order to determine the stiffness of the structures studied. The results showed that the CFRP/PVC foam sandwich material absorbed least amount of energy at the impact test. The amount of energy absorbed was only in the elastic region of the material, but the structure did not have the ability to deform plastically. It was interesting to note that this kind of structure indicated a possibility to reduce weight, by approximately 24 % lighter than the current aluminium material. The Hybrix material combined with steel absorbed most amount of energy but was 27 % heavier than the current aluminium material. Finally, the three point bending showed that the aluminium structure had the highest stiffness of the samples studied...|$|E

The reduced 172 MB Class 9 (332000) database was prepared and ordered from 2 CD-ROMS with duplicate records removed. Front-axle weight and gross-vehicle weight (GVW) are combined conceptually by determining the <b>front</b> axle <b>weight</b> in four-quartile GVW categories. The four categories of <b>front</b> axle <b>weight</b> from the four GVW categories are combined in four ways. Three linear combinations are with fixed-coefficient fiducials and one is that optimal linear combination producing the smallest standard deviation to mean value ratio. The best combination gives coefficients of variation of 2 [...] 3 % for samples of 100 trucks, below the expected accuracy of single-event WIM measurements. Time tracking of data shows some high-variation sites have seasonal variations, or linear variations over the time-ordered samples. Modeling of these effects is very site specific but provides a way to reduce high variations. Some automatic calibration schemes would erroneously remove such seasonal or linear variations were they static effects...|$|R

5000|$|The major {{mechanical}} {{difference between}} the Legend and the Toyota, Mazda and Nissan sedans was that the Legend was front wheel drive, which Honda stated was [...] "quite simply the most logical means to the ends the engineers desired: a true luxury car with a low, aerodynamic hood; a spacious interior with a nearly flat floor, and the superior traction that results from placing the engine and drivetrain transversely over the drive wheels." [...] This provided the Legend with a front-end heavy 63/37 <b>front</b> to rear <b>weight</b> distribution ratio, similar to the NSU Ro 80. The ride was engineered to appeal towards the luxury car market and not necessarily towards the performance market, and the <b>front</b> to rear <b>weight</b> distribution ratio reflected this goal.
