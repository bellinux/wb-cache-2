Attempts to extend definitions of the Wigner distribution to <b>discrete</b> <b>signals</b> have not been completely successful. In this letter, we propose an alternative definition for the Wigner distribution, which has a clear extension to <b>discrete</b> <b>signals.</b> Under this definition, we show that the Wigner distribution does not exist for certain classes of <b>discrete</b> <b>signals...</b>|$|R
