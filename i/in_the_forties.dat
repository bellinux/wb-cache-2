5|$|For the English {{winter of}} 1930–31, Lee took on {{positions}} at both St. Andrew's College and Rhodes University, both in Grahamstown in South Africa. The MCC were touring that winter, and suffered heavily with injuries and illness. No fewer than seven players were missing at various stages, and the England captain, Percy Chapman, requested that Lee be excused from his coaching duties {{to join up}} with the touring party. Having believed he had secured this permission, {{he made his first}} appearance against Natal, scoring 14 runs in his only innings. He played in three further tour matches, twice making scores <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forties,</b> but not reaching a half-century during the tour. His only Test appearance came in the fourth Test between England and South Africa. Lee opened the innings alongside Bob Wyatt and scored 18 and 1 in his two innings of the match, which finished a draw. During the match, the MCC were contacted by one of the schools he had been coaching at, which claimed that Lee had broken his contract by leaving without permission. Lee argued vehemently against these claims, citing the fact that the sportsmaster at the school had told Jack White that he had permission to leave, but the MCC were unmoved, and refused to issue Lee his England cap and blazer until he had apologised. Lee felt he had no need to apologise, and never received either cap or blazer, though small compensation {{came in the form of}} an England touring tie, which Jack Hobbs gave to him.|$|E

25|$|After World War I broke out, {{the market}} for luxury horses {{suddenly}} became {{the market for}} military remounts. The increased availability of cars and tractors limited the roles that horses could play in agriculture and transportation. Starting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forties,</b> technical advancements in agricultural machinery initially required {{a new type of}} horse, but soon after made the horse superfluous altogether in the field. So to adapt, starting in 1920 the direction changed radically: a heavy warmblood of great economy with a good walk, calm temperament, which matures early and utilizes its feed well. The type was so heavy, it stood on the boundary with the lighter coldbloods.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>forties</b> of {{the twentieth}} century, Steven Corbet was deputy-keeper of the insect {{collection}} of the Natural History Museum. He {{was at that time}} also the foremost authority on the Linnean butterflies, and had access tot the collection of the Linnean Society. During research, Corbet found the specimen labelled Ajax in Linnaeus's own handwriting. From the way it was pinned, Corbet concluded that it was almost certainly a specimen collected by Pehr Osbeck in Canton in 1751, so not of North-American origin. Corbet at once identified the type as a specimen of the Oriental species named Papilio xuthus by Linnaeus in 1767, a name by which it has ever since been known.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though both}} plants were busy during the war, {{the company did}} not prosper <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forties</b> due to {{shortages}} of lumber and labor as the country's workforce went to war. Minutes of the 1946 stockholders' meeting show the company's lumber inventory had been reduced, from over 3 million board feet in 1942, to just over a million in 1946. After the war, there was pent-up demand not only for boxes and crates, but also for furniture that the Tacoma plant had been producing. The company expanded to produce box-springs, and began an effort to improve handling of lumber to be kiln-dried. Both plants also continued to replace aging steam engines and boilers with electrical mill machinery. But there were no dividends distributed to stockholders for 1946. The trends of the decade were higher wages, shortages of materials, higher prices, and heavy competition, especially from local non-unionized factories.|$|E

25|$|Lawry {{started the}} 1967–68 home series against India well. After {{compiling}} 42 and a duck in the First Test win, {{he made an}} even 100 in the Second Test in Adelaide to help secure an innings victory. After the Test, Lawry became Australian captain when Simpson stood aside having {{announced that he would}} retire from international cricket {{at the end of the}} series. His form remained consistent, scoring 64, 45, 66 and 52 in the two remaining Tests as Australia completed a 4–0 clean sweep. He had a productive summer with 369 runs at 52.71. In all first-class matches, Lawry made 805 runs at 47.35, adding a second century for the season in a vain attempt to prevent a Victorian defeat at the hands of Western Australia. Throughout the summer, Lawry made many start without converting them into large scores. In 17 innings, he made six half-centuries, all less than 70, and four scores <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forties.</b> Under his leadership, Victoria won three and lost two of their seven Shield matches for the season.|$|E
25|$|Ryan Sidebottom dug {{out the top}} four, {{ending with}} four for 41, and Andrew Harris got exactly the same figures (but from half the overs), as Warwickshire crashed to 156 at Trent Bridge after winning the toss and opting to bat first. And from then on, it only got worse for the {{visitors}} from the Midlands. Only Dougie Brown's 34 not out took them past 150, and he then took two wickets as Nottinghamshire looked to go the same way - being 45 for 3. However, David Hussey and Chris Read batted well together, seeing Nottinghamshire to stumps and making fifties. Their 148-run partnership gave Nottinghamshire a healthy lead, but Hussey did not stop there. He made a career-best 232 not out - eventually running out of partners as Nottinghamshire finished on 514, to secure a first-innings lead of 358. Brown took five for 128, but despite bowling the most overs of all he could not stop the rampant Hussey. Nick Knight was injured and could not bat, so with ten men Warwickshire had to score 358 to make Nottinghamshire bat again. It was an impossible task - Alex Loudon and Neil Carter both made scores <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forties,</b> but the team succumbed to 207 and their third innings defeat of the season. Warwickshire were later deducted 0.5 points for a slow over rate on day two.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Kent, Somerset did {{feature in}} the first round, in which they faced Leicestershire. Mervyn Kitchen and Graham Burgess each batted well to propel Somerset to a score of 251 for 9. Leicestershire were then bowled out for 160 runs after just 46.3 overs, giving Somerset a 91-run victory. Somerset's second round match against Warwickshire, in Birmingham, took three days to complete. Somerset batted first again, and scored 206 for 8. No batsmen {{particularly}} stood out; Roy Virgin, Bill Alley and Colin Atkinson all made scores <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forties,</b> while Kitchen scored 35, and no other batsman reached double figures. Warwickshire then reached 84 for 4 just short of halfway through their overs when the game was postponed due to bad weather. Cricket {{at the time was}} not played on Sundays, and no further play was possible on Monday, so the game continued on Tuesday, when economical bowling from Fred Rumsey, along with the wickets taken by Alley on the first day, helped to restrict Warwickshire to 181 runs. Somerset batted first again in their quarter final match against Northamptonshire, but only managed to score 184 runs. No Somerset player managed to score more than 40 runs during the innings. The Somerset bowlers played well in comparison; Rumsey took four wickets, while Alley conceded only eight runs from his twelve overs, and Northamptonshire were bowled out for 148. Somerset once again had no stand-out batting performance in their semi-final; Kitchen was their highest scorer with 40 runs, as they posted 210 for seven in a rain-interrupted innings which continued into {{the second day of the}} match. Three of the Somerset bowlers, Ken Palmer, Rumsey and Alley all conceded less than two runs per over to help their side limit Lancashire to 110 runs, and give Somerset a 100-run victory.|$|E

500|$|Critic Jonathan Rosenbaum cited The Seventh Victim as his {{favorite}} horror film; {{it is the}} only horror movie on his list of 100 favorite movies. Film historian Carlos Clarens also praised the film, noting: [...] "Rarely has a film succeeded so well in capturing the nocturnal menace of a large city, the terror underneath the everyday, the suggestion of hidden evil," [...] and deemed it [...] "hauntingly oppressive." [...] In Guide for the Film Fanatic, critic Danny Peary wrote that The Seventh Victim is [...] "a complete original, a cult film in England way back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forties.</b> It features bizarre and sinister characters (i.e. a one-armed female devil-worshipper who plays piano), smart, strong-willed women, and several scary scenes... The double suicide [...] that ends the film is perhaps the most baffling, depressing moment in all horror films." ...|$|E
500|$|When Fox {{decided to}} produce no further Chan films, Sidney Toler {{purchased}} the film rights. Producers Philip N. Krasne and James S.

For the first time, Chan was portrayed on occasion as [...] "openly contemptuous of suspects and superiors." [...] African-American comedic actor Mantan Moreland played chauffeur Birmingham Brown in 13 films (1944–1949) {{which led to}} criticism of the Monogram films <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forties</b> and since; some call his performances [...] "brilliant comic turns", while others describe Moreland's roles as an offensive and embarrassing stereotype. Toler died in 1947 and was succeeded by Roland Winters for six films. Keye Luke, missing from the series after 1938's Mr. Moto rework, returned as Charlie's son {{in the last two}} entries.|$|E

500|$|The Coen {{brothers}} {{first met}} Sam Raimi when Joel Coen {{worked as an}} assistant editor on Raimi's The Evil Dead (1981). Together, they began writing the script for The Hudsucker Proxy in 1981, and continued during the filming of Crimewave (1985), and post-production on Blood Simple (1985), in which Joel and Ethan Coen shared a house with Raimi. The Coens and Raimi were inspired by the films of Preston Sturges, such as Christmas in July (1940) and the Hollywood satire, Sullivan's Travels (1941). The sentimental tone and decency of ordinary men as heroes was influenced by films of Frank Capra, like Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), Meet John Doe (1941), and It's a Wonderful Life (1946). The dialogue is an homage to Howard Hawks' His Girl Friday (1940), while Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance as fast-talking reporter Amy Archer is reminiscent of Rosalind Russell and Katharine Hepburn, in both the physical and vocal mannerisms. Other movies that observers found references to include Executive Suite (1954) and Sweet Smell of Success (1957). The brothers had no intention commenting on or parodying such movies, instead as Ethan said [...] " [...] It's the case where, having seen those movies, we say ' They're really fun - let's do one; as opposed to 'They're really fun- let's comment upon them." [...] Raimi describes the script as [...] " [...] "big-business comedy. It's {{a return to the}} very large love story comedies they used to make <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>forties</b> and early fifties." [...] So the brothers started to pace around their apartment, taking turns on the typewriter, and when they found themselves stuck at a point, Raimi would do all sorts of tricks to get the boys back up. For example, while Ethan is pacing around, he would move things around the apartment so Ethan would be thrown off, he even said he threw firecrackers at them.|$|E
500|$|Despite the New York City setting, {{additional}} skyscrapers in Chicago, Illinois provided {{inspiration for}} the opening sequence of the skyline, such as the Merchandise Mart and Aon Center. Skyscrapers from New York City included the Chanin Building, the Fred F. French Building and One Wall Street, Manhattan. [...] "We took all our favorite buildings in New York from where they actually stood and sort of put them into one neighborhood," [...] Gassner continued, [...] "a fantasy vision which adds to the atmosphere and flavor." [...] First of all, a model had to be created based on the fantasy 1950's New York for the opening shot. So a miniature city was created, as McAlister mentioned that the Coens did not want a realistic reproduction of [...] 1950's New York skyline, instead they wanted a more stylized version of it. [...] So Gassner used the book New York <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Forties</b> as a reference to create the look for the cityscape. It took three months and 27 crew member to create the miniature city at the scale of 24:1. As for the Hudsucker building, they made it at the scale of 6:1 for closer shots including the long-zoom in of Norville at the beginning. For that scene to be created, it started off with a wide angle shot, moving closer towards Tim Robbins, who was standing in a full sized set, which they inserted inside the shot of the model clock. ‘Marrying a live-action image with a painted or miniature element was, of course, nothing new, however, {{in the case of}} the zoom-in on Robbins from such a distance, keeping the full-size set locked in with the model building, ‘that was state-of-the-art and the only way to do it was with computers.’ says McAlister. Most of the buildings were created with two sides only, as they will only be seen from the front and the side, and some only needed one side as they were only going to be seen from the front, while the Hudsucker building was made completely three-dimensional. The work of The Computer Film Company (supervised by Janek Sirrs) included manipulations of the zoom-in shot of Norville at the beginning, as well as CGI snow and composites of the falling sequences.|$|E
