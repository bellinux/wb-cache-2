2500|$|The {{entomologist}} E. O. Wilson has characterised parasites as [...] "predators {{that eat}} prey in units {{of less than}} one". Within that scope are many possible ways of life. Parasites are classified {{in a variety of}} different but overlapping schemes, based on their interactions with their hosts and on their life cycles. An obligate parasite is totally dependent on the host to complete its life cycle, while a <b>facultative</b> <b>parasite</b> is not. A direct parasite has only one host while an indirect parasite has multiple hosts. For indirect parasites, {{there will always be a}} definitive host and an intermediate host.|$|E

5000|$|Phasmarhabditis is a genus of bacterial-feeding {{nematodes}} {{which are}} <b>facultative</b> <b>parasites</b> that primary host are terrestrial gastropods (slugs and snails). The {{name comes from}} Greek: Phasma- (φάσμα (monster); rhabditis = rod-like (ῥάβδος (rhabdos). The Phasmarhabditis genus contains Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita, Phasmarhabditis neopapillosa [...] & Phasmarhabditis californica.|$|R
50|$|Phasmarhabditis californica is a {{nematode}} in {{the family}} Rhabditidae. It is a lethal <b>facultative</b> <b>parasite</b> of the terrestrial gastropods (slugs and snails).|$|E

50|$|Orobanchaceae is {{the largest}} of the 20-28 dicot {{families}} that express parasitism. It consists of all types of plant parasitism: <b>facultative</b> <b>parasite,</b> obligate parasite, hemiparasites, and holoparasites.|$|E
50|$|Athelia is a genus of corticioid {{fungi in}} the family Atheliaceae. Some species are <b>facultative</b> <b>parasites</b> of plants (including crops) and of lichens. The {{widespread}} genus contains 28 species. However, Athelia rolfsii was found to belong in the Amylocorticiales in a molecular phylogenetics study, but has yet not been renamed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Facultative</b> {{intracellular}} <b>parasites</b> {{are capable}} of living and reproducing either inside or outside cells.|$|R
50|$|Recently formed parasites undergo severe {{bottlenecks}} and {{can rely}} on host environments to provide gene products. As such, in recently formed and <b>facultative</b> <b>parasites,</b> there is an accumulation of pseudogenes and transposable elements {{due to a lack}} of selective pressure against deletions. The population bottlenecks reduce gene transfer and as such, deletional bias ensures the reduction of genome size in parasitic bacteria.|$|R
50|$|Rhynchogastremataceae is {{a family}} of fungi in the order Tremellales.Only a single species is known, Rhynchogastrema coronatum, {{isolated}} from soil, and probably a <b>facultative</b> <b>parasite</b> of other fungi.|$|E
5000|$|This is a <b>facultative</b> <b>parasite</b> whose stages remain unclear. It dwells {{actively}} in soil, plants, and other organically rich environments [...] including manure and compost; {{it is sometimes}} found in horses.|$|E
50|$|Rhopalomyces elegans is {{a common}} species of zygomycete fungus, and the type species of the genus Rhopalomyces. Widely distributed, it is found in soil, rotting plant material, and animal dung. It is a <b>facultative</b> <b>parasite</b> of {{nematode}} eggs.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{members are}} {{primarily}} <b>facultative</b> <b>parasites</b> and commensals {{of humans and}} other animals, living {{in and around the}} sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and other areas of the skin. They are virtually ubiquitous and do not cause problems for most people, but propionibacteria have been implicated in acne and other skin conditions. [...] One study found the Propionibacterium was the most prevalent human skin-associated genus of microorganisms.|$|R
50|$|Mortierella is {{the most}} {{commonly}} encountered and well studied of the genera. Members of this genus typically are saprobes in soil, dung, and reproductive bodies of higher fungi, but there are <b>facultative</b> <b>parasites.</b> Isolates of Mortierella can be readily obtained from forest soils on Czapek agar, hay agar, or water agar. Members of this genus are thought to play significant roles in temperate forest ecosystems, though many are psychrophiles (requiring cold temperatures for growth) and are likely overlooked in soil samples incubated at room temperature.|$|R
50|$|Diplonemidae is a {{small group}} of {{flagellate}} protists, with the majority being free living phagotrophs, though some are <b>facultative</b> <b>parasites.</b> They are especially common in marine habitats where they consume detritus, algae and other particles of moderate size. Two species also live in fresh water. They are oval with two short flagella inserted in a subapical pocket. They have a highly active metabolism, with feeding apparatus arranged longitudinally and connected with the flagellar apparatus. Diplonemid mitochondria contain few very large flattened cristae, whereas most other Euglenozoa have smaller and more numerous discoidal cristae.|$|R
50|$|Like {{others of}} its genus, it is a root {{parasitic}} plant, attaching {{to the roots}} of other plants to obtain nutrients and water. This species is a <b>facultative</b> <b>parasite,</b> or hemiparasite, in that it can live without attaching to another plant but will parasitize if presented with the opportunity. It often parasitizes plants of the heath family, such as manzanita.|$|E
50|$|Parasites are {{classified}} {{based on their}} interactions with their hosts and on their life cycles.

5000|$|Athelia {{arachnoidea}} is a corticioid fungus in {{the family}} Atheliaceae. The species forms thin, white, cobwebby basidiocarps (fruit bodies) and typically occurs saprotrophically on leaf litter and fallen wood. It can, however, also be a <b>facultative</b> <b>parasite</b> of lichens and can additionally be a plant pathogen (typically found in its asexual Fibulorhizoctonia carotae state), causing [...] "crater rot" [...] of stored carrots.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, green {{plants in}} genera such as Rhinanthus and Colpoon can grow {{independently}} of any host, {{but they also}} act opportunistically as <b>facultative</b> root <b>parasites</b> of neighboring green plants.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} this in humans is Naegleria fowleri. As a rule this amoeboid species is a {{free-living}} predator on microbes, but occasionally it successfully infects humans as a <b>facultative</b> internal <b>parasite.</b>|$|R
40|$|Wheat seed is a {{very good}} medium for {{development}} of numerous saprophytes and parasitic fungi species that influence biological characteristics of seed and its value. The presence of fungi, especially parasitic species, causes some changes (colour changes, empty seed, spots, mould, deformation) in seed macroscopically visible. The most common agents are <b>facultative</b> <b>parasites</b> (Fusarium graminearum, Helminthosporium sativum, Septoria nodorum). They are believed to be extremely harmful since their influence on the essential seed functions are negative. The research was done on two wheat cultivars (Ţitarka and Demetra). Significant differences in micopopulation were registered at two points - immediately after harvesting and after seed storage - despite the used methods (filter paper, moist chamber, deep-freezing, germination in sand) and applied fungicides (Raxil 2 WS and Vitavax 200 FF). The most numerous micopopulation was established in non-treated seed after harvesting by freezing method. There were 9 fungi genera determined of which weretwo <b>facultative</b> <b>parasites.</b> All research done on treated seed showed that there was a smaller number of fungi species and the percentage of the infected seed was lower. Under the influence of Fusarium graminearum as well as other fungi species the ability of germination was decreased. According to all used methodes both wheat cultivars seed treated with fungicides were chacarterized by a lower level of infection and better germination during both research periods. By the analyses done on the stored seed a higher percentage of nongerminate seed and deformed germs were established, especially on the treated wheat seed...|$|R
50|$|An obligate {{parasite}} or holoparasite, is a parasitic organism that cannot complete its life-cycle without exploiting a suitable host. If an {{obligate parasite}} cannot obtain a host it {{will fail to}} reproduce. This is opposed to a <b>facultative</b> <b>parasite,</b> which {{can act as a}} parasite but does not rely on its host to continue its life-cycle. Obligate parasites have evolved a variety of parasitic strategies to exploit their hosts.|$|E
50|$|Castilleja caudata is an herb {{with a short}} taproot. The plant {{appears to}} be a <b>facultative</b> <b>parasite,</b> capable of {{surviving}} without draining nutrients from other plants but growing more healthy if it can draw sustenance from other plants. Stems can reach a height of 40 cm (16 inches). Leaves and stems tend to be hairless toward the bottom, finely hairy above, and bristly in the inflorescence. Leaves are narrowly lanceolate, tapering gradually toward the tip. The inflorescence has 5-12 flowers, the flowers greenish-yellow each with a greenish-yellow to cream-colored bract below.|$|E
5000|$|Orchitophrya stellarum tolerates a sea {{temperature}} range of between [...] and [...] and a salinity range of between 2 {{and at least}} 30 parts per thousand of salt equivalent. The lower the temperature, the lower the acceptable level of salinity. Growth is most rapid at 24 °C. It is a <b>facultative</b> <b>parasite</b> of sea stars in the Asteriidae family. It seems {{to be able to}} survive in the open sea indefinitely {{as long as there is}} a supply of bacteria and tissue detritus on which it can feed.|$|E
50|$|Francisella is a genus of pathogenic, Gram-negative bacteria. They {{are small}} coccobacillary or rod-shaped, nonmotile organisms, {{which are also}} <b>facultative</b> {{intracellular}} <b>parasites</b> of macrophages. Strict aerobes, Francisella colonies bear a morphological resemblance {{to those of the}} genus Brucella.|$|R
50|$|L. pneumophila is a <b>facultative</b> {{intracellular}} <b>parasite</b> {{that can}} invade and replicate inside amoebae in the environment, which can thus {{serve as a}} reservoir for L. pneumophila, {{as well as provide}} protection from environmental stresses, such as chlorination.|$|R
40|$|Lucilia sericata {{is one of}} the <b>facultative</b> <b>parasites</b> {{which causes}} myiasis in animals, and rarely in humans as an ectoparasite. Infestation in humans and {{domestic}} herbivorous animals occurs in wounds, mouth, eyes, and nose. It causes itching, pain, inflammation, secondary bacterial infections, eosinophilia, and erythema. We report on a 26 -year-old man from Kashan, with a 12 -year history of opium and a 3 -year history of heroin injections was taken to Iran, following a heroine injection, and with signs of hypoxic encephalopathy, decreasing mental clearness, and coma. He was HBsAg and HIV negative, and HCV positive. From the wounds of his left hand, which were caused by repeated injections, 38 live larvae were removed. The larvae proved to be Lucilia sericata...|$|R
50|$|Kretzschmaria deusta, {{commonly}} known as brittle cinder, is a fungus and plant pathogen found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is common {{on a wide range}} of broadleaved trees including beech (Fagus), oak (Quercus), lime (Tilia), and maple (Acer). It causes a soft rot, breaking down both cellulose and lignin, and decays the trunk and/or roots of living trees. The fungus continues to decay wood after the host tree has died, making K. deusta a <b>facultative</b> <b>parasite.</b> The resulting brittle fracture has a ceramic-like fracture surface. Black zone lines can be seen in cross-sections of wood infected with K. deusta.|$|E
50|$|Like {{some other}} {{bumblebee}} taxa, this species {{is a social}} parasite. It does not produce its own worker bees and cannot maintain its own colony; instead, individuals live inside the nest of another bumblebee species. B. inexspectatus lives inside the nest of the more common red-shanked bumblebee (Bombus ruderarius). It is supported by its host, as it cannot produce the wax used to build nests {{and it does not}} have pollen baskets on its legs. Thus, it is an obligate social parasite, one that must be supported by another species, rather than a <b>facultative</b> <b>parasite,</b> which can live on its own if necessary. This species has apparently evolved obligate parasitism separately from the few other taxa that practice it, such as the cuckoo bees (subgenus Psithyrus).|$|E
5000|$|Halicephalobus gingivalis is a {{free-living}} nematode {{species that}} was identified and named in 1954 by Stefanski. It is a <b>facultative</b> <b>parasite</b> of horses and humans. Based on studies performed on infected horses in Florida, {{it can be}} inferred that the parasite is associated to swampland environments. They are dioecious as both female and male organs have been found separately. Eggs and immature larvae {{have been found in}} tissue sections, indicating an asexual reproductive cycle. Free-living males have been found in soil environments, indicating that sexual reproduction also occurs. The site of entry for the parasite is hypothesized to be through breaks in skin or through mucous membranes. They are distributed worldwide as cases of equine infections have been found in Canada, Florida, the Nordic regions, and Arabian horses alike.|$|E
40|$|In the {{evolution}} of interspecific social parasites, the shift from facultative to obligate brood parasitism {{is thought to be}} driven by the cost of parental investment. Accordingly, avian brood parasites with precocial young are almost exclusively <b>facultative</b> <b>parasites,</b> whereas those with altricial young are almost exclusively obligate parasites. Surprisingly, then, North American cuckoos (Coccyzus spp.) have altricial young but are described as <b>facultative</b> brood <b>parasites.</b> Because little is known about parasitism by Coccyzus cuckoos, we explored the potential importance of heterogeneric brood parasitism to their reproductive strategy. In contrast to the existing set of anecdotal reports of cuckoos parasitizing songbirds, we found no evidence of cuckoo parasitism in 10 [*] 197 songbird nests, despite spatial and temporal overlap between cuckoos and potential hosts and despite varied food availability. Experiments revealed a lack of egg-rejection behavior {{in some of the most}} common potential hosts, suggesting that parasitic eggs would be accepted if laid and that we would detect cuckoo parasitism if it occurred regularly. We propose that reports of Coccyzus cuckoos parasitizing songbirds stem from errant attempts to parasitize other cuckoos. This resolves a theoretical paradox about interspecific parasitism and mode of offspring development, as we suggest that Coccyzus cuckoos have not evolved to parasitize other species.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{competitive}} saprophytic ability (CSA) of two destructive {{root rot}} pathogens of sugarbeet (Beta vulgaris L.) seedlings, viz., Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn. and Rhizoctonia bataticola (Tassi) Goid was investi. gated using the Cambridge method by employing {{two types of}} baits (wheat straw and sugarbeet hypocotyl pieces) in a sandy loam soil. The competi-tive saprophytic colonization (CSC) of these two baits by these two <b>facultative</b> <b>parasites</b> appreciably increased as the concentration of inoculum increased in the soil. The per cent colonization of baits was also influenced by the incubation period. Key words: Inoculum density, inoculum potential, saprophytic behaviour, Rhizoctonia solani, R. bataticola The success of root infecting fungi depends on their potential to survive saprophytically in soil or on or-ganic residues buried in soil, or on dead tissues colo-nized during the parasitic phase (Dhingra and Sinclair...|$|R
