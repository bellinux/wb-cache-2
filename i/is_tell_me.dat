6000|$|There was {{a mixture}} of truth {{in this part of the}} charge which disconcerted Lord Glenvarloch exceedingly; for he could not, as a man of honour, deny that Lord Dalgarno, and others, had {{occasionally}} jested with him on the subject of Dame Nelly, and that, though he had not played exactly le fanfaron des vices qu'il n'avoit pas, he had not at least been sufficiently anxious to clear himself of the suspicion of such a crime to men who considered it as a merit. It was therefore with some hesitation, and in a sort of qualifying tone, that he admitted that some idle jests had passed upon such a supposition, although without the least foundation in truth. John Christie would not listen to his vindication any longer. [...] "By your own account," [...] he said, [...] "you permitted lies to be told of you injest. How do I know you are speaking truth, now you are serious? You thought it, I suppose, a fine thing to wear the reputation of having dishonoured an honest family,--who will not think that you had real grounds for your base bravado to rest upon?

DEAR MOTHER--You or Jeff {{must try}} to write {{as soon as you}} receive this and let me know how little Sis <b>is.</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> if she got entirely over the croup and how she is--also about George's trunks. I do hope he {{received}} them; it was such a misfortune; I want to hear the end of it; I am in hopes I shall hear that he has got them. I have not seen in the papers whether the 51st has left New York yet. Mother, I want to hear all about home and all the occurrences, especially the two things I have just mentioned, and how you are, for somehow I was thinking from your letters lately whether you was as well as usual or not. Write how my dear sister Mat is too, and whether you are still going to stay there in Portland avenue the coming year. Well, dear mother, I am just the same here--nothing new. I am well and hearty, and constantly moving around among the wounded and sick. There are a great many of the latter coming up--the hospitals here are quite full--lately they have [been] picking out in the hospitals all that had pretty well recovered, and sending them back to their regiments. They seem to be determined to strengthen the army this spring to the utmost. They are sending down many to their reg'ts that are not fit to go in my opinion--then there are squads and companies, and reg'ts, too, passing through here in one steady stream, going down to the front, returning from furlough home; but then there are quite a number leaving the army on furlough, re-enlisting, and going North for a while. They pass through here quite largely. Mother, Lewis Brown is getting quite well; he will soon {{be able to have a}} wooden leg put on. He is very restless and active, and wants to go round all the time. Sam Beatty is here in Washington. We have had quite a snow storm, but [it] is clear and sunny to-day here, but sloshy. I am wearing my army boots--anything but the dust. Dear Mother, I want to see you and Sis and Mat and all very much. If I can get a chance I think I shall come home for a while. I want to try to bring out a book of poems, a new one, to be called [...] "Drum-Taps," [...] and I want to come to New York for that purpose, too.|$|E

50|$|The {{two of them}} {{relocate}} to Beardsley School for Girls, where Humbert gets a teaching job and Lolita attends the 8th grade (Buckin’ for Beardsley/Beardsley School for Girls”). Lolita is angry with Humbert for not allowing her to star in the school play. The Headmistress meets with Humbert to express her concerns about Lolita: that {{she has not been}} properly educated about sex, and needs more social interaction with her peers. She presents Humbert with an ultimatum: either he and Lolita attend group therapy, or he allows Lolita to participate in the school play written by Quilty. Humbert agrees to the latter. During rehearsal, Quilty meets Lolita and becomes fascinated with her; he admits that his uncle, a dentist and friend of Charlotte’s, told him she was at school. Quilty decides to break off his relationship with his partner after meeting Lolita (“March Out of My Life”). Meanwhile, Humbert has become increasingly paranoid about Lolita’s absence from home, and confronts her (“The Same Old Song (Reprise)”). Lolita protests innocence, and her friend Phyllis corroborates her story, but Humbert doesn’t believe her. Lolita accuses Humbert of keeping her locked up under the guise of loving her (“All You Can Do <b>Is</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> You Love Me”).|$|E
40|$|Background:  It is a truism that {{nursing care}} must be {{informed}} by assessment, otherwise how can one know what care is required or {{that it has been}} successfully delivered? Yet, {{little is known about the}} process of comprehensive mental health nursing assessment in practice. If the education of mental health nurses is to be effective, it is essential that the key content of, and the processes involved in carrying out a mental health nursing assessment in practice are able to be articulated to learners. Aim:  To identify the processes of assessment that occur in mental health nursing practice based on interviews with mental health nurses working in clinical and management roles in clinical areas. Method:  Interviews were undertaken with 18 nurses who worked in inpatient and community mental health settings either as clinicians or managers. The nurses ranged from new graduates to those with more than 20 years of experience. Findings and discussion:  Clear processes were reported to be involved in undertaking a comprehensive mental health nursing assessment in practice, with three main themes emerging during analysis. First is the importance of engaging the patient; second <b>is</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what the problem is? with one subtheme reconcile inconsistencies; and finally, the ongoing nature of the assessment process. Conclusion:  Common processes emerged when the nurses described their individual approaches to undertaking comprehensive mental health assessment. The results have important policy implications for the educational preparation of mental health nurses, their ongoing supervision and further research into contemporary mental health nursing practice...|$|E

The objective {{of this study is}} to develop appropriate tasks by using songs for teaching listening skills for grade X students of MAN Yogyakarta II in the academic year of 2010 / 2011. This study is categorized as a Research and Development (R&D) study. The steps in this study were conducting the needs analysis, developing the course grid, developing the first draft of the tasks, trying-out the first draft of the tasks, evaluating the draft of the tasks, revising the draft of the tasks, and writing the final draft of the tasks. The instruments used in this study were questionnaires and interview guideline. The questionnaires were given in two separate times. The first questionnaire was administered to find out the students’ needs toward the learning of English listening skills. The second questionnaire was distributed to get the feedback from the students related to the first draft of the tasks. The developed tasks are divided into three units. Each unit consists of 14 to 16 tasks. The topic of each unit <b>is</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> What You did Yesterday for Unit 1; Once Upon a Time for Unit 2; and What does She Look Like for Unit 3. Unit 1 talks about past experience in the form of recount. Unit 2 explores stories in the form of narrative. Unit 3 discusses people descriptions in the form of descriptive. The average score of the respondents’ agreement toward the statement in the second questionnaire is 3. 4375 to 4. 375. The scores were in the range of ideal one, i. e. ˃ 4. 2 (Very Good Category) and 3. 4 ˂ ≥ 4. 2 (Good category). The scores indicate that the developed tasks are suitable with the students’ needs and interest...|$|E
