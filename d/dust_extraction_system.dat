In batch plants, the fibre additive is added direct to the pugmill using individually wrapped press packs or bulk dispensing equipment. Mixing times may be extended ensure that fibre is homogeneously distributed throughout the mix and temperatures controlled in order to avoid overheating or damage to the fibre. In drum plants, particular care must be taken to ensure that both the additional filler content and fibre additive are incorporated into the mixture without excessive losses through the <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>system.</b> Filler systems that add filler directly into the drum rather than aggregate feed are preferred. Pelletised fibres may be added through systems designed for addition of recycled materials, but a more effective means is addition through a special delivery line that is combined with the bitumen delivery, so that the fibre is captured by bitumen at the point of addition to the mixture.|$|E

The measurement of solids phase velocity therefore has wide potential application in flow monitoring and, in conjunction with density measurement instrumentation, solids mass flow rate measurement. Historically, a number of authors have detailed possible measurement techniques, and some have published limited test results. It is, however, apparent that none of these technologies have found wide application in industry. Solids phase velocity measurements were undertaken using real time cross correlation of signals from two electrostatic sensors spaced axially along a pipeline conveying pulverised coal (PF). Details of the measurement equipment, the pilot scale test rig and the test results are presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a number of electric charge sensors. The sensors have been developed specifically to investigate triboelectric charge transfer which takes place between particles and the pipeline wall, when powdered materials are conveyed through a pipeline using air. A number of industrial applications exist for such gas-solids pipelines, including pneumatic conveyors, vacuum cleaners and <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>systems.</b> The build-up of electric charge on pipelines and powdered materials can lead to electrostatic discharge and so is of interest from a safety viewpoint. The charging of powders can also adversely affect their mechanical handling characteristics and so is of interest to handling equipment engineers. The paper presents the design of the sensors, the design of the electric charge test rig and electric charge measurement test results...|$|R
40|$|Dust {{control in}} belt {{conveying}} operations {{is becoming increasingly}} important due {{to a number of}} reasons, most notably the increasing emphasis on health and safety and also the conservation of the environment. The primary objective is to reduce dust emissions by passive means without the need for external energy as associated with <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>systems.</b> Pilot scale tests followed by proven industrial applications have confirmed that very effective passive dust control is achievable by maintaining streamlined flow of the bulk solid through the conveyor transfer system. This experience provides the background to the present paper which focuses on the modelling of chute flow aimed at achieving optimum performance. The work presented in this paper involves an initial study of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to investigate the granular flow through a typical transfer chute with a view to reducing dust emissions. Experiments using a scale model test rig are described and the test results are compared with the computed results obtained by the CFD/continuum model. As a final discussion the integration of CFD with a well established continuum model (Roberts, 2003) is considered...|$|R
5000|$|De Hoop is {{what the}} Dutch {{describe}} as a [...] "stellingmolen" [...] It is a three-storey smock mill on a three-storey base. The stage is at third-floor level, 7.00 m above ground level. The smock and cap are thatched. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch with a continuous chain. The cap rotates on 24 wooden blocks. The sails on the outer sailstock are Common sails, with leading edges streamlined on the Fok system. The sails on the inner sailstock are Ten Have sails, with leading edges fitted with aerofoils on the Van Bussel system. Both have a span of 24.55 m. The sails are carried on a cast-iron windshaft, which was cast by IJzergieterij Hardinxveld-Giessendam as number 47. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 65 cogs. This drives the wallower (32 cogs) {{at the top of}} the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the great spur wheel, which has 87 cogs, drives the two lantern pinion stone nuts, which have 27 and 28 staves. These drive the 1.40 m and 1.50 m diameter millstones. A third pair of stones is driven by an electric motor so production could continue on days when there was not enough wind.Several modern developments were added during the 1992 rebuild. A chain elevator lifted grain from the ground floor to the grain silos on the third floor (first floor in the smock) from where it could be fed by gravity to one of the pairs of millstones. The grain flow to the silos and from silo to millstone was computer controlled by pneumatically operated valves. Also a central <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>system</b> was added. Flour was collected on the first floor in a large silo and mixer from where it could be bagged on the ground floor. Unfortunately following years of standstill and disuse these systems are no longer functional. The ground floor also houses a small shop selling flour and bread making products.|$|E

The case study comprised of a large crushing station that screens and crushes oversize product. The coal processed varies from dry dusty coal to wet cohesive coal that can often block sections of the transfer chute. The air generation can often be significant in the stilling chamber on the out-going conveyor due to the large drop height, making it a formidable task to design a reliable <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>system.</b> Material testing for DEM calibration purposes was conducted on representative samples of dry and wet coal {{in order to improve}} the accuracy of the solution.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Construction {{workers are}} educated at {{vocational}} training centers before they begin their working lives. Future bricklayers and their instructors {{are exposed to}} respirable dust and possibly to hazardous respirable crystalline silica from trial mortar. METHODS: Thirty-six personal air samples were collected at six training centers to estimate exposure to respirable dust for both students and teachers. A selection of 22 samples was analyzed for crystalline silica. RESULTS: Average respirable dust exposures ranged from 0. 59 mg/m(3) for teachers to 1. 45 mg/m(3) for students performing recycling and cleaning tasks. In 45 % of the analyzed samples, respirable crystalline silica was detected. Exposure to silica remained below the Dutch OEL (75 microg/m(3)). Exposure was significantly less for teachers than for students. This effect was found in both types of vocational training centers present in the Netherlands. Dry sweeping, as performed at all locations in this study, contributed considerably to the exposure to respirable dust. A first step in reducing exposure to dust and silica at training centers would therefore be to avoid dry sweeping. The presence of a <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>system,</b> although not optimally designed, also significantly lowered exposure. CONCLUSIONS: To assess a construction worker's lifetime exposure to respirable dust and crystalline silica, the vocational training period should also be taken into account. Several epidemiological {{studies have shown that}} time since first exposure can be an important risk factor for chronic health effects...|$|E
40|$|Basic oxygen {{steelmaking}} (BOS) produces significant {{quantities of}} dust which are both rich in iron, and varied in composition, presenting either a potential recycling resource or disposal liability. In particular, the {{increasing use of}} galvanised steel in the automotive industry has resulted in larger quantities of galvanised scrap recycling during BOS manufacturing. The zinc from this scrap finds its way into the process dusts, contaminating them and causing difficulties in their recycling. The treatment of BOS dust via pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes has been researched extensively and proven to be difficult to be commercially successful. The objectives of this study were to characterise the zinc contamination of BOS dust; assess the impact of charging different amounts of galvanised scrap and waste oxide briquettes (WOBs); and to analyse if zinc contamination can be reduced by holding galvanised scrap in a hot converter in an inert nitrogen atmosphere, prior to the hot metal addition, to volatilise the zinc. The impact of the different scrap charges and the success of holding the galvanised scrap were evaluated by measuring the mass and concentration of the zinc in the BOS <b>dust</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>systems.</b> The finding of this work includes: 25...|$|R

However, some challenges are facing in fabrication and {{assembly of the parts}} with composite materials.

In the past years, a lot of solutions are described and various information <b>extraction</b> <b>systems</b> are implemented.
