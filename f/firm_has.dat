40|$|Comparing the {{financial}} characteristics of firms {{in different countries}} and different regions has been a popular research topic in finance. However, NAFTA and Latin American manufacturing <b>firms</b> <b>have</b> never been compared. In this paper, we undertake such a study with the MANOVA (Multivariate Analysis of Variance) method and with data drawn from the Research Insight/Global Vintage database in October 2015. Our findings indicate that NAFTA manufacturing <b>firms</b> <b>have</b> less liquidity risk, but more financial risk, compared with Latin American Manufacturing firms. NAFTA manufacturing <b>firms</b> <b>have</b> significantly higher returns on equity due to achieving higher returns on assets and using more financial leverage.

5|$|The {{game with}} no {{government}} subsidy {{to the domestic}} firm is shown in Figure 1 on the left. If both firms enter, they each suffer a loss of 10 million dollars and if they both {{stay out of the}} market neither firm makes a profit or a loss. If only one firm enters however, that firm will realize a profit of 50 million dollars while the other firm will make nothing. The two Nash equilibria of this game (marked in purple) are the situations in which only one firm enters – but which firm, domestic or foreign, is indeterminate. In such a situation if the foreign <b>firm</b> <b>has</b> a slight initial advantage over the domestic firm (perhaps because it began product development earlier) the domestic firm will stay out and the foreign firm will enter.|$|E

Federal contractors must deal with an exceptional amount of paperwork and bureaucracy relative to firms that deal only with the private sector. I investigate whether federal contractor’s costs have different responses to revenue increases and decreases. I start by generating a set of federal focus <b>firms</b> that <b>have</b> a business unit name that incorporates the words federal, military, and defense. These <b>firms</b> <b>have</b> built their organizational structure around federal contracting. Because extra paperwork costs are likely {{to be part of the}} Selling, General, and Administrative (SGA) costs, I estimate a model of SGA sticky costs. I find that when revenues increase, federal focus <b>firms</b> <b>have</b> greater increases in SGA costs compared to controls. This increase is consistent with higher fulfillment costs for federal contracts. When revenues decrease, federal focus <b>firms</b> <b>have</b> a much lower decrease in SGA costs compared to controls. Federal focus <b>firms</b> <b>have</b> extremely sticky SGA costs.
