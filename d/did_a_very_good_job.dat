25|$|In March 2016, Pakistan's {{exit from}} the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 after losing 3 matches caused great {{controversy}} in Pakistan, with blame shifting between Waqar Younis {{as well as many}} of the players on the team. Hafeez was accused, by Younis, of lying about his knee injury before the T20. He said it could have affected the teams poor performance. Despite bad performance during the T20I world cup 2016 Hafeez was picked for the England tour of 2016 Hafeez was out on 0 several times throughout the test series and during the ODI series in the first match he was out on 11 which then he was dropped for rest of the tour because of bad performance and not fit enough to play. After missing out of international cricket for months in which he missed the West Indies series in the UAE, Hafeez was then picked for the Australia tour 2017 to play the ODI series. As of the first ODI match Hafeez was out on 4. For the second ODI Azhar Ali was ruled out because of injury which promoted Hafeez to captain Pakistan, Hafeez <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> as Pakistan won the match and first time in 12 years in Australian soil. Not only that Hafeez captaincy was appreciated but he also made 72 runs which earned him player of the match.|$|E

Felipe Massa, asked about his last lap fight with teammate Bottas, stated: [...] "I’m getting old for that! I even said to the team I’m getting old!

[...] During the post-race press conference, Hamilton expressed surprise over his championship lead, since {{he had not been}} made aware of Rosberg's retirement at that point. When asked about the tyre pressure issue, Sebastian Vettel defended Hamilton, saying: [...] "I think it’s not fair to hand that question to Lewis because he doesn’t know what’s going on [...] In a lot of respect and fairness he <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> today and you have to accept that." ...|$|E
500|$|City Lights {{marked the}} first time Chaplin {{composed}} the film score to one of his productions. While Chaplin preferred his films to have live sound by the 1930s most theaters had gotten rid of their orchestras. Many of his critics claimed he was doing it to grab more credit. Chaplin, whose parents and many members of the Chaplin family were both musicians, was struggling with the professional musicians he hired and took it upon himself to compose the score himself. It was written in six weeks with Arthur Johnston and included over one hundred musical cues. Chaplin told a reporter that [...] "I really didn't write it down. I la-laed and Arthur Johnson wrote it down, and I wish you would give him credit because he <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job.</b> It is all simple music, you know, in keeping with my character." [...] The intention was to have a score that would translate the characters' emotions through its melodies. The score was recorded in five days with musical arranger Alfred Newman.|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the record}} crowd {{remained}} after the game as they watched Seattle players and coaches engaged in the post match trophy awarding ceremony and celebrated on the field. [...] In the post match press conference, Sigi Schmid praised his team's defensive efforts in the match, saying [...] "We talked about making sure their defenders – and primarily Pável Pardo – didn’t {{have a chance to}} lift their heads and hit those long balls in behind." [...] Schmid continued, [...] "I thought Evans did a really good job. Sometimes we were stretched in the midfield, but I thought he <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> of stepping up to Pável. When you look at the 90 minutes, it was a rare occasion {{that he was able to}} hit a ball behind our defense." [...] Chicago midfielder Logan Pause commented on the game saying, [...] "It’s disappointing. We came here to win. We were under the gun all night. They’re a great team, one of the best in the league. It was a great atmosphere and home field advantage. The better team won tonight unfortunately." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics lauded the {{development}} of the storyline between Shane and Rick. Writing for Best Week Ever, Dan Hopper stated that it presented a cold and eerie outlook {{on the future of the}} two men. Nate Rawlings of Time evaluated their physical confrontation as [...] "darn good", and Alex Crumb of The Faster Times called it [...] "wholly satisfying". Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich commended the fight scene; [...] "The Shane/Rick fight was great, a brilliantly extended scuffle that started out with an air of boys-will-be-boys pettiness but quickly escalated into something genuinely homicidal." [...] Goldman summated on the scene: [...] "Of course, it was also gratifying to finally see that conflict turn physical, with a fight we've been waiting to see for a long time. Rick vs. Shane was appropriately brutal and <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> of representing the two men's different tactics—Rick was no doubt a formidable and dangerous guy in a fight, wailing on Shane with a series of punches. But Shane was going for the kill, using anything he could grab as a weapon, as he shoved a motorcycle onto Rick at one point and then threw a massive wrench at him in an effective, 'Holy S**t!' moment." ...|$|E

[...] Following a tale of love and separation, the video alternates between two different time frames. The first of these involves a tearful Carey in the present, while the second invokes memories of a relationship with a former lover (played by Dolce & Gabbana model Christian Monzon).

And we’ve had some nice conversations and, um, a nice time. OK, I'll say he definitely <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> in the video."
