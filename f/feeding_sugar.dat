Feedings was provided by Boardman feeders and the amount was adjusted according to consumption. A layer of beeswax was manually set up into the honeybee nest and beeswax built area was measured weekly. Total reducing sugar, calorimetry, dry matter and ashes of all feedings were analyzed.

40|$|The {{hypothalamus}} is {{the main}} appetite-regulating center in the brain receiving peripheral signals regarding the metabolic status of the body. Pancreatic procolipase has recently been identified in rat hypothalamus. Procolipase is known mainly for its actions in the intestine where it is cleaved to colipase, an enzyme required {{for the maintenance of}} pancreatic lipase activity, and enterostatin, a peptide involved in appetite regulation through the gut–brain axis. Colipase is able to increase the activity of pancreatic lipase-related protein- 2 (PLRP 2), a lipase also expressed in extra-pancreatic tissues. This study was performed to elucidate if PLRP 2, in addition to colipase, is expressed in the hypothalamus and if the mRNAs of colipase and PLRP 2 respond to metabolic challenges such as fasting, high-fat feeding or <b>feeding</b> <b>sugar</b> solutions. RNA from rat hypothalamus was extracted and subjected to RT-PCR. For quantitative mRNA analysis of hypothalamic tissue from the different metabolic situations real-time RT-PCR was used. We found PLRP 2 and colipase mRNA to be expressed in the hypothalamus. An overnight fast resulted in down-regulated colipase (3 -fold) and PLRP 2 (7 -fold) mRNA compared to freely fed rats. Conversely, high-fat feeding resulted in up-regulated colipase and PLRP 2 mRNA (1. 3 -fold and 1. 8 -fold, respectively) compared to standard chow-fed rats. A similar up-regulation in mRNA expression was observed after offering sugar solutions. In conclusion, PLRP 2 mRNA is expressed in the rat hypothalamus and both procolipase and PLRP- 2 mRNA are down-regulated during fasting and up-regulated during conditions of metabolic excess, suggesting an involvement in signaling energy availability...|$|E

Two fistulated Friesien Holstein grade of each feeding used in this research. The ration in given similar with the sample to measured the degration in the rumen are corn stover (CST) and sugar cane top (SCT). Disappearance of the NDF, ADF, and NDIN in the rumen was calculated based on the incubation time and using an exponential negative modwl Y= a + b (1 -e-ct) from Orskov and Mc Donald, (1979). Values of a,b and c fraction were used to calculate theoretical degradation DT=a+ ((b. c) /(c+Kp)) with the assumption  of flow of particle (Kp) is about 5 %/hour. The results on fermentation characteristics of feeding corn stover give ph about 6. 54 ± 0. 16; N-NH 3 about 7. 36 ± 3. 10 mg/ 100 ml and VFA about 64. 84 ± 10. 82 mmol/ 1, whilst for <b>feeding</b> <b>sugar</b> can to give ph about 6. 54 ± 0. 14; NH 3 about 2. 62 ± 0. 85 mg/ 100 ml and VFA about 44. 13 ± 6. 7 mmol/ 1.

40|$|The floral and the {{geographical}} origins of honey {{can be determined}} by microscopic examination of the pollen present, however this technique {{cannot be applied to}} highly strained or pollen free honeys. Thus, {{there is a need for}} a chemical technique that can be applied to such samples. This present work was undertaken with the help of the British Beekeepers Association and their members, who provided honey samples of known origin within the United Kingdom for chemical evaluation and comparison. There were 192 samples of English honey from the U. K. survey and an additional 69 samples including those of foreign origin obtained from various sources. A selection of 11 foreign and 5 English honeys were examined for proteins present by the technique of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate. This approach was abandoned since preliminary studies indicated that a correlation between the proteins and {{the geographical}} origin was not possible. For 256 samples out of the 261, the free amino acids and the pollens present were examined. The free ninhydrin positive substances were separated by ionexchange chromatography and then concentrated. Forty ninhydrin positive substances were detected by a combination of paper electrophoresis and chromatography and 28 of these compounds were identified. quantitative measurements of the concentration of 13 detectable amino acids were made on an automatic amino acid analyser. The average concentration of the 13 amino acids of the 191 samples of the U. K. survey and those of the 5 predominant pollens of the U. K. have been given in Table A. The major floral sources of-each honey were confirmed by quantitative pollen analysis of the original sample. It was found that by performing discriminant analysis using the computer package Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) that the amino acid concentration measurements could be correlated to the floral source of the samples examined, provided the sub-group samples were sufficiently large. The overall pattern of floral sources coupled with the detection of ninhydrin positive substances can be used successfully to categorise unspecified samples. This is then followed by correlation, in some cases, with amino acid concentration measurements using the SPSS to predict a definite geographical region. The potential role of using the SPSS predictive classifications to evaluate the following aspects of honey production were indicated to be successful. These aspects were: honeydew and nectar honeyst <b>feeding</b> <b>sugar</b> to honeybees, the effects of heating honey, adulteration especially with foreign honeys and/or commercial sugar products, commercial processing methods and floral source with reference to plant family...|$|E

Foram utilizadas 40 ovelhas da raça Santa Inês individualmente alojadas em baias cobertas. Não houve diferença (P> 0, 05) entre os tratamentos na produção de leite. O teor de gordura do leite foi maior nas ovelhas que consumiram as rações contendo as silagens.

A concentração de ácidos graxos não-esterificados não foi alterada (P> 0, 05) entre os tratamentos. Não foi verificada diferença (P> 0, 05) entre os tratamentos nas avaliações do comportamento ingestivo dos animais.

Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effects of fresh sugarcane or sugarcane silages added during ensiling with calcium oxide and limestone (1 % as-fed basis). The experiment I assessed the fermentative characteristics and aerobic stability of silages and fresh sugarcane. The lowest gas losses were observed for treatments containing calcium oxide and limestone. These two treatments also showed low ethanol production and higher concentrations of residual soluble carbohydrates, acetic and butyric acids when compared with non-treated silage. In the aerobic stability trial, silage treated with calcium oxide presented the highest aerobic stability, observed by the heating delay and the lowest dry matter losses. Nutrient digestibility and ruminal parameters were also evaluated in the experiment II using sixteen Santa Inês ram lambs kept in metabolism crates. All experimental diet contained 50 % of roughage (DM basis) and treatments were defined according to roughage type: fresh sugarcane, sugarcane silage with no additive, sugarcane silage with calcium oxide (1 % as-fed basis), and sugarcane silage with limestone (1 % as-fed basis). It was observed difference (P 0. 05), with mean value of 6. 3. In the experiment III, milk production, ovarian activity resumption, and ingestive behavior were evaluated using forty Santa Inês ewes individually penned.
