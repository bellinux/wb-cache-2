We identify 36 volatility events, {{most of which are}} purely regional, but three of which are national. We find significant associations of volatility events and economic conditions, especially national and regional income growth, inflation, and interest rates. During an <b>initial</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>period</b> after a volatility shift, realized housing returns move opposite to volatility. We find evidence of significant interregional diffusion of volatility increases, but not of decreases.

It was found that the horizontal and vertical distribution of cumulus heating can be altered in ASCP by adjusting these parameters. These changes can have a strong influence on the vertical structure of condensation heating, water vapor distribution, temperature, and rainfall. The CCWF is an important limiting parameter that controls the onset of different cloud types; increasing the threshold values of CCWF for all clouds tends to concentrate the rainfall into a narrower ITCZ and affects the rainfall during the <b>initial</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>period...</b>|$|E

The physiological responses of populations of a marine Pseudomonas sp. to nutrient starvation were observed for periods of up to 40 days. At various intervals during starvation, the numbers of total, viable, and respiring cells were determined within the cultures. The ATP content, endogenous respiration rate, uptake rates, and percent respiration for exogenous glucose and glutamate were determined throughout the starvation period to characterize the physiological changes in the cells.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} the effects of pH and acid concentration on the dissolution of enamel, dentine, and compressed hydroxyapatite (HA) in citric acid solutions (15. 6 and 52. 1 mmol l(- 1); pH 2. 45, 3. 2, and 3. 9), using a pH-stat system. After an <b>initial</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>period,</b> the dissolution rates of enamel and HA were constant, while that of dentine decreased with time. The dissolution rate increased as the pH decreased, and this was most marked for enamel. To compare substrates, the rate of mineral dissolution was normalized to the area occupied by mineral at the specimen surface. For a given acid concentration, the normalized dissolution rate of HA was always less than that for either dentine or enamel. The dissolution rate for dentine mineral was similar to that for enamel at pH 2. 45 and greater at pH 3. 2 and pH 3. 9. The concentration of acid significantly affected the enamel dissolution rate at pH 2. 45 and pH 3. 2, but not at pH 3. 9, and did not significantly affect the dissolution rates of dentine or HA at any pH. The variation in response of the dissolution rate to acid concentration/buffer capacity with respect to pH and tissue type might complicate attempts to predict erosive potential from solution composition...|$|E
40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} the effects of dietary supplementation with rice bran, sire breed and gender on live animal performance and carcass characteristics in Australian crossbred and purebred Merino lambs. Methods: Forty-eight lambs balanced by sire breed (Dorset, White Suffolk, Merino) and gender (ewe, wether) were randomly allocated into three dietary supplementation groups (Control- 24 lambs fed wheat/barley-based pellets, Low- 12 animals fed a 50 / 50 ratio of wheat-based/rice bran pellets, and High- 12 lambs fed rice bran pellets). The Rice bran pellets replaced 19 % of the barley component of the feed. Animals were group-fed at the rate of 1000 g of the supplement per head per day with ad libitum access to lucerne hay as the basal diet and water. The duration of the feeding trial was 49 days with an <b>initial</b> 21 -day <b>adjustment</b> <b>period.</b> Results: Sire breed differences were evident for initial (p < 0. 0002) and final (p < 0. 0016) liveweights, hot carcass (p < 0. 0030) and cold carcass (p < 0. 0031) weights, as well as dressing percentage (p < 0. 0078), fat thickness (p < 0. 0467), yield grade (p < 0. 0470) and rib eye area (p < 0. 0022) with purebred Merino under-performing compared to the crossbreds. Concentrate feed conversion efficiency, costs per unit of liveweight gain and over the hooks income were comparable between treatments regardless of the observed trend where the high supplementation group tended to show lower feed intake (745. 8 g/day) compared to both the control (939. 9 g/day) and lo...|$|R

40|$|Beach-cast kelp (the {{most widely}} used feed for commercially grown South African abalone) is {{plentiful}} during winter months when periodic storms cause kelp to wash ashore. During summer, however, this resource is not always readily available and farmed abalone are often starved for short periods. The aim {{of this research was}} to assess how periodic kelp starvation influences growth of the commercially grown abalone, Haliotis midae Linnaeus. Growth of grow-out abalone was monitored on a commercial abalone farm over a period of six months and consisted of 3 treatments with 2 replicates (n = ± 250 abalone per replicate). The treatments were: Control (abalone always given more kelp than what they typically needed); Treatment 1 (abalone fed their weekly ration only once a week); Treatment 2 (abalone fed half their weekly ration every 3 and then 4 days respectively). While the data at first suggest that the control animals outperform the treatment animals, after undergoing an <b>initial</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>period</b> to the new feeding regime, the treatment animals perform better. Weight gain and feed conversion efficiencies show that the treatment animals perform better overall. The control animals generally required much more feed to produce comparable increases in both length and weight compared to the treatment animals.

40|$|During {{the second}} part of the 1990 s, the Israeli economy {{experienced}} a surge in labor productivity and total factor productivity, which was driven primarily by the manufacturing sector. This surge in productivity coincided with the full absorption and integration into the workforce of highly skilled immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The Soviet immigrants were disproportionately employed in manufacturing and, after an <b>initial</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>period,</b> progressively moved into higher responsibility occupations where their skills could be put to use more efficiently. This has led some observers to comment that the high-skilled immigration wave was one of the main determinants for the fast growth of the Israeli economy in the 1990 s. In this paper, I use a unique data set on Israeli manufacturing firms and investigate directly whether firms and industries with a higher concentration of immigrants experienced increases in productivity. The analysis shows that there is no correlation between immigrant concentration and productivity at the firm level in cross-sectional and pooled OLS regressions. First-differences estimates, which control for fixed unobserved differences between firms, reveal, if anything, a negative correlation between the change in output per worker and the change in the immigrant share. A more in-depth analysis reveals that the immigrant share was strongly negatively correlated with output and productivity in low-tech industries. In high-technology industries, the results tend to point to a positive relationship, hinting at complementarities between technology and the skilled immigrant workforce. immigration, productivity...|$|E
40|$|Obesity is a {{worldwide}} epidemic. Diet, exercise, and medical therapies alone {{have not been}} enough {{to stem the tide}} of this epidemic. Bariatric surgery has been found not only to be the most effective intervention for morbid obesity, but also results in substantial improvement in many of the associated co-morbid conditions. However, {{it is not clear what}} impact the surgery and subsequent life-style changes have on the patients' couple relationships. In order to explore the impact of bariatric surgery on the couple relationship, two research articles were completed: (a) a systematic literature review was used to explore existing research on the impact bariatric surgery on the marital/couple relationship and (b) a phenomenological study was conducted to explore and better understand the impact of weight loss surgery on the couple relationship. The results of the literature review demonstrated that very little is known on this topic. Of the published studies focusing primarily on the effects of weight loss surgery and couples, the vast majority of these studies were conducted between the years 1977 and 1991, with the most current study published in 2000. The more recent studies found that many couple relationships improved or remained stable after an <b>initial</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>period</b> post-surgically.

40|$|Abstract Purpose:to study {{changes of}} the intraocular {{pressure}} at high altitude and to compare tonometric measurements and atmospheric pressure. The intraocular pressure (IOP) increase {{is one of the}} favourable factors in the apoptosis or death of the retinal nervous cells and is responsable for the progressive lost of the same cells. Methods:during the "Cho Oyu 2008 " expedition, some tonometric readings were recorded to 13123 ft. at the main base campsat 21066 ft. Four climbers undergone an ophthalmic check-up and a retinal peripapillary fibers thickness study with laser scanning polarimeter (GDx VCC Zeiss) before the depart. During the expedition, tonometric measurements were taken using the handheld instrument Tono Pen Avia (Reichert). Upon returning from the expedition, the four mountain climbers once more underwent ophthalmic examination and a study of the nervous retinal peripapillary fibers using GDxVCC. The readings recorded were analyzed using a Test T. Data collection on web and data elaboration was managed by CoMed research. Results:compared with the readings recorded during the first examination, a rise in the pressure readings was observed during the expedition. The IOP increase proved to be directly proportional to the reduction of the atmospheric pressure. However, when the measurements were taken again a week after, at the same altitude, a fall in the IOP readings was observed with a decrease within original readings. Conclusions:the ascent to high altitude initially determines a IOP increase in healthy subjects. However, the rise in IOP {{does not appear to be}} permanent. After an <b>initial</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>period,</b> IOP readings returned within normal parameters. GDx measurements taken before and after the expedition are already under observation...|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} nature and {{performance}} of the New Zealand sheep meat industry from 1980 to 2007. As almost 94 per cent of sheep meat produced in New Zealand is exported {{the focus of this}} study is on the export sector of the sheep meat industry, and in particular, the lamb meat export industry. Deregulation of the New Zealand economy led to a fundamental change of philosophy within the sheep meat industry. Government support was reduced in the mid- to late- 1980 s, and financial deregulation was initially associated with rising interest rates and high exchange rates. After an <b>initial</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>period,</b> interest rates fell, but variable exchange rates have remained. After having a high level of involvement in the processing and marketing sectors through ownership of both processing companies and product, the role of the New Zealand Meat Board reduced in the mid- 1990 s to that of an industry-good role, managing quota and allocating research funding. In the sheep meat industry, markets and market destinations have not changed dramatically over the study period 1980 - 2007, but the product form has undergone some quite radical changes. The nature of the product now being sold has been transformed from a frozen carcass to a range of both chilled and frozen, and bone-in and boneless cuts of lamb. Over the period concerned, supermarkets have emerged as the dominant prescriber of specifications, and these specifications have become more demanding. This study has identified a number of factors that have been important in transforming the sheep meat industry from a heavily subsidised, production-driven sector to one that is more market-oriented operating in a market economy. The study has also identified factors that underpin the continued instability of the industry as a whole, and specifically, low profitability for process-exporting companies and variable returns for farmers...|$|E
40|$|Transgenerational {{plasticity}} (TGP), a type {{of maternal}} effect, occurs when the environment experienced by one or both the parents prior to fertilization directly translates, without changing DNA sequences, into changes in offspring reaction norms. Evidence of such effects {{has been found in}} several traits throughout many phyla, and, although of great potential importance - especially in a time of rapid climate change - TGP in thermal growth physiology had never been demonstrated for vertebrates until the first experiment on thermal TGP in sheepshead minnows, who, given sufficient time, adaptively program their offspring for maximal egg viability and growth at the temperature experienced before fertilization. This study on sheepshead minnows from South Carolina and Connecticut investigates how population, parent temperature, and offspring temperature affect egg production, size, viability, larval survival and growth rates, whether these effects provide evidence of TGP, and whether and how they vary with length of exposure time (5, 12, 19, 26, 33 and 43 days) of the parents to the new experimental temperatures of either 26 °C or 32 °C. Several results are consistent with those obtained in the previous TGP study, which outline a sequence of events consisting of an <b>initial</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>period</b> to the new temperatures, in which egg production decreases and no signs of TGP are present, followed by a shift to TGP (towards 26 - 33 days of exposure) in which parents start to produce more eggs which are better adapted to the new thermal environment. Other results present new information, such as signs of TGP in the parent temperature effect on egg sizes already around 20 days of exposure. The innovative idea of populations being able to adapt to rapidly shifting environments through non-genetic mechanisms such as TGP opens new possibilities of survival of species and will have important implications on ecology, physiology, and contemporary evolution...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: The black cutworms (Agrotis ipsilon) {{were grown}} in an {{artificial}} medium {{to evaluate their}} potential as a human food. Approach: The culture was started from moths and the life cycle and culture structure were evaluated. There was an <b>initial</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>period</b> of 3 days during which {{the growth of the}} larvae was very slow. The size of the larvae increased reaching maximum weight and length after 23 days and then declined as the larvae entered the pupation stage. For an efficient production system, the larvae should be harvested after 21 days. The moisture content of the medium may present an important management problem for commercial production. Results: A system in which the eggs are separated from the adults and hatched in separate cages would alleviate the danger of losing the new larvae due to fungal disease. The high moisture content of the larvae (60 %) could also cause handling and storage problems. Drying and grinding the larvae would reduce them to easily manageable forms and would improve their marketability as novel food. The moisture, ash, carbohydrate, protein and fat contents were, 13. 4, 12. 1, 7. 5, 53. 1 and 13. 9 % (dry basis), respectively. The larval time index (time to produced one gram) was 3. 20 d g - 1 weight. Considering the fact that a female moth produces 1200 eggs, the population time index is 3. 90 min g - 1 weight. Because the larvae seem to be a promising source of protein for human consumption, further research is required to evaluate their growth characteristics on low substrates. Conclusion: The research should also evaluate the quality of larval protein (amino acid profile) and other nutritional values such as vitamins and minerals. The effects of environmental parameters, such as temperature, relative humidity and CO 2 and heat production on food consumption and protein yield, should also be investigated. This information will aid in the design of an optimal production system of insect protein...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} subjective uncertainty, threat, and psychological and behavioural acculturation {{from the perspective of}} well-educated Canadian women who emigrated from Asia. In the first study, 153 women completed a questionnaire. These women lived in Canada for an average of 17 years, and were proficient in English. In the second study, in-depth qualitative interviews with three women who scored high and three women who scored low on the cultural uncertainty scale in the first study illustrated how women describe uncertainty in their lives. Subjective uncertainty reduction theory (SURT) posits that higher uncertainty leads to stronger group identification. However, Study 1 and Study 2 contradicted SURT, in that higher certainty was related to stronger cultural and Canadian identities. Women in this research identified strongly with their cultural group and as Canadians, they reported low levels of uncertainty, and they did not feel very threatened. Women’s stories from Study 2 illustrate these findings. Moreover, threat and uncertainty were not related, suggesting that they are two conceptually different constructs. In Study 1, uncertainty and threat significantly contributed to the prediction of women’s strength of social identifications after controlling for background variables, providing support for social identity theory. As well, Study 1 and Study 2 found support for the bidimensional approach to acculturation, remooring of cultural identity, and the compatibility of women’s cultural and Canadian identities. These findings are consistent with past research, and suggest that women had very secure cultural and Canadian identities. The six interviews demonstrated the breadth and idiosyncratic nature of women’s experiences. However, several themes revealed that social identifications served three functions for women: enhanced self-esteem, ingroup cooperation and cohesion, and social interactions. Whether these motives are derivatives of subjective uncertainty needs further investigation. Taken together, these results suggest that SURT may be more applicable as a theory of adaptation, in that the <b>initial</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>period</b> may induce high uncertainty and insecure social identifications. More broadly, the findings suggest continued application of theory to real-life settings is critical to the investigation of the motivational dynamics of identity choice and maintenance...|$|E

For Test+RPL, 45 g of RP-Lys (AminoShure-L®; Balchem Corp., New Hampton, NY, containing 23. 4 g Lys) was top-dressed on the TMR once daily. The PC diet resulted in lower dry matter intake (P = 0. 03) as compared to either the Test or Test+RPL diet. PC, Test, and Test+RPL cows averaged 42. 6, 42. 9, 43. 6 kg/d of milk and 27. 3, 28. 4, 28. 8 kg/d of DMI, respectively. Crude protein intake for the PC, Test, and Test+RPL diets was 4. 83, 4. 67, and 4. 74 kg/d respectively. MUN decreased (P 0. 05) among treatments. A post-study CPM Dairy evaluation using final chemical composition analyses of the feedstuffs and average production data from the animals predicted that diets supported more than 47 kg of milk and Lys was not limiting. Cows on the study produced slightly less milk, however DMI was 5 - 8 % more than predicted by initial formulations. Formulation accuracy of the MP and Lys deficient diet may have been improved if data had been available from an <b>initial</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>period</b> measuring DMI, body weight, milk yield and milk composition. It is also possible that the bioavailability of the RP Lys was not as great as thought during the diet formulation process. However, given the fact that the post-trial CPM analysis did not indicate a deficiency of Lys, it is not very likely that this impacted the results of this trial...|$|E
40|$|Fixed {{nitrogen}} (N) limits phytoplankton growth {{throughout the}} low latitude ocean. The oceanic reservoir of this essential nutrient {{is therefore a}} critical determinant of the fertility of the ocean as a whole, {{and the strength of}} the biological pump that sequesters carbon in deep waters out of contact with the atmosphere. Two biological processes dominate the ocean's N budget: a source of N through N 2 fixation by diazotrophic plankton, and a sink through bacterial denitrification when oxygen is depleted. These processes are subject to external climate-related forces that push the N budget out of balance, but also coupled through internal feedbacks that strive to restore a balance and stabilize the N reservoir. The feedback mechanism can be thought to operate like a "nutrient thermostat", in which the nitrogen-to-phosphorous (N:P) requirement of phytoplankton represents a setpoint towards which the ratio of N and P reservoirs is restored. This dissertation comprises four projects that address different aspects of the general question: how flexible is the oceanic N reservoir? 	Chapters 2 and 3 examine the flexibility of the setpoint towards which the N reservoir is restored. In Chapter 2, a diagnostic model is used to show that the N:P of nutrient drawdown by marine phytoplankton, long considered to have a universal "Redfield ratio" of 16 : 1, varies significantly at the scale of marine biomes due to stoichiometric diversity between taxa. Thus the mean N:P of marine phytoplankton, previously thought of as a fundamental biological property, only reflects the balance of high and low N:P biomes under modern-ocean conditions. Chapter 3 explores the role of this variability in the nutrient thermostat feedbacks. An ecosystem model is used to show that the ratio of nutrient reservoirs it is biased upwards towards the high N:P requirements of subtropical phytoplankton that cohabit and compete directly with N 2 -fixers. This resolves a discrepancy between the observed N reservoir and the predictions of "Redfieldian" models, which lose too much N before reaching equilibrium. We also demonstrate {{an important role in the}} nutrient thermostat for ocean circulation, which communicates stoichiometric signatures between biomes. Changes in the N reservoir may thus be driven, over millennial timescales, by a restructuring of plankton biomes and the circulation pathways that connect them. Chapters 4 and 5 examine the potential for variations in the N reservoir via direct forcing of the oceanic N budget. Chapter 4 focuses on the process of N 2 -fixation, which may be limited either by an external supply of Fe through the atmosphere, or the internal generation of N deficits that allow diazotrophs to compete with faster-growing plankton, which are susceptible to N-limitation. Multiple geochemical constraints are used to show that N 2 -fixation in the modern ocean is limited by Fe inputs at the community scale, but strongly coupled to N loss through denitrification at the basin scale. These results reconcile biochemical evidence for Fe-stress in diazotroph communities with the existence of regulatory feedbacks that maintain a balanced the N budget. Within the regime of intermediate Fe-control, the oceanic N reservoir would respond weakly to the enhanced dust fluxes hypothesized for a glacial climate, but strongly to the reduced fluxes expected under climate warming. Chapter 5 uses a biogeochemical model to derive a simple framework for understanding the strength of N cycle feedbacks. A feedback response to any N-budget forcing comprises two components: a fast <b>initial</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>period</b> involving only the upper ocean, in which changes in the N reservoir are minor, and a slow millennial response involving deep ocean circulation. The magnitude of changes in the N reservoir depend on the fraction of forced anomalies that "leak" into the deep ocean, and the timescale over which those deep-ocean anomalies are removed. Feedbacks through N 2 -fixation, rather than denitrification, are most efficient at preventing leakage and removing deep-ocean anomalies, and are strong enough to prevent major perturbation to the N reservoir, unless Fe shortages confine diazotrophs to small regions of the ocean...|$|E
