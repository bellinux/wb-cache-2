Game commented these statements about given was so far off his radar and that it was ridiculous.

2500|$|As the First Indochina War ended, and the Kingdom of Laos moved towards independence, {{the departing}} French bureaucrats and {{soldiers}} were gradually replaced by Americans. Captain Kong Le {{was opposed to}} foreign involvement in his nation's affairs, so he staged a coup d'etat on 9 August 1960. A counter-coup by General Phoumi Nosavan would eclipse him on 14 December 1960. In {{the wake of his}} ascension, James William Lair of the Central Intelligence Agency secretly entered Laos. On 9 January 1961, Lair helicoptered out to Ta Vieng on the Plain of Jars to meet a young Hmong lieutenant colonel of the Royal Lao Army named Vang Pao. A Thai officer with Lair arranged a later meeting. On 11 January, Vang Pao told Lair, [...] "Either we fight or we leave. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> weapons, we fight," [...] When asked how many troops he could raise, he asked for equipment to begin training 10,000 recruits.|$|E
2500|$|On July 26, 1976, Gacy {{employed}} an 18-year-old named David Cram. On August 21, Cram {{moved into}} his house. The following day, Gacy conned Cram into donning handcuffs while the youth was inebriated. Gacy swung Cram around while holding the chain linking the cuffs, then {{informed him that}} he intended to rape him. Cram, who had spent a year in the Army, kicked Gacy in the face, then freed himself from the handcuffs as Gacy lay prone. One month later, Gacy appeared at Cram's bedroom door with the intention to rape him and said: [...] "Dave, you really don't know who I am. Maybe it would be good <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> what I want." [...] Cram resisted Gacy's attempts to assault him and Gacy left his bedroom. After this incident, Cram moved out of Gacy's home and subsequently left PDM Contractors, although he did periodically work for Gacy over the following two years. Shortly after Cram had vacated Gacy's residence, another employee of PDM Contractors, 18-year-old Michael Rossi, moved into Gacy's house.|$|E
2500|$|Singing differs {{by region}} in {{that a high}} falsetto {{is used in the}} north while in the south a lower range is used. [...] "To the {{unfamiliar}} listener, Indian singing sounds exotic, different, and difficult to comprehend," [...] and the contrast in the quality or timbre of voice used in traditional Indian and European musics may {{have much to do with}} that difficulty. However, [...] "to the trained ear, melodies flow, ascend and descend" [...] while dancers react to changes in the structure of the melody and the song. Boye Ladd says, [...] "If you give me a stink song, I'll dance stink. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> good music, I'll give you a great show," [...] implying that one can appreciate the music through the dancing, which is readily appreciated by everyone. But others say that today's contemporary contest dancers are expected to dance their best no matter how well or poor the drum group is that is singing for their contest. Generally, Native American singing follows a pentatonic scale (as if playing only the black keys on a piano) and while, to the outsider, it may sound like we're just pounding a drum and going [...] "Heya-heya-heya-heya" [...] sometimes there are actual words in Cree, Pikuni, Lushuutsid, Niimipuu, Lakhota, Sahpatin, Salish, Ojibwemowin or many other Native languages.|$|E

2500|$|Once Phoumi's counter-coup succeeded on 14 December 1960, Lair {{moved his}} {{headquarters}} to Vientiane. Fitzgerald promptly joined him there. Fitzgerald {{saw that the}} PARU's flawless performance in the counter-coup was based on reliable inside information, and decided that Lair and his special forces police should remain in Laos. This series of events marked {{the start of the}} Laotian Civil War. Once established there, Lair reached out to contact Vang Pao. He flew via Air America Sikorsky H-34 to the Lao village of Tha Vieng to meet the Hmong leader on 19 January 1961. Vang Pao told Lair that his people could not live under Vietnamese communist rule. [...] "Either we fight or we leave. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>me</b> weapons, we fight," [...] he told Lair. He promised he could call up 10,000 tribesmen for military training. They would follow him, he promised, and he pledged loyalty to the King of Laos. The approximately 4,300 Hmong who had accompanied him at Tha Vieng indicated that Vang Pao already had a sizable following. Although Lair did not know it at first, he was about to inherit a tradition of resistance to the Vietnamese. In the late-1800s the Hmong had founded zones of resistance under the command of local village chiefs. Now, many of their descendants would join the CIA effort. Lair saw the Hmong guerrillas as a valuable supplement to the Royal Lao Army's regular forces. His seniors agreed.|$|E
