25|$|Because the {{necropolis}} of Sekhemkhet {{was never}} finished, {{it is hard}} to say which planned cultic building had already existed. The pyramid courtyard was surrounded by a niched enclosure wall facing north-west. It was 1.850ft long, 607ft wide and 33ft high. The only archaeologically preserved cultic building is the Southern Tomb, its base measurement is estimated to be 105ft x 52ft. The subterranean structure included a tight corridor, beginning at the western site of the tomb and ending in a <b>double</b> <b>chamber.</b> In this chamber in 1963 Jean-Philippe Lauer excavated the burial of a 2-years-old toddler. The identity of this child remains a mystery, the only for sure known fact about it is that it cannot be king Sekhemkhet himself, since the king was always depicted as a young man.|$|E

Microbial Fuel Cells can be simultaneously {{used for the}} treatment of wastewater and generation of electricity. In this study single <b>chamber</b> MFC and <b>double</b> <b>chambered</b> MFC were compared for the distillery wastewater treatment and generation of electricity. Microorganisms present in distillery wastewater and sewage were used as inoculum, and distillery wastewater acted as substrate. Single chamber MFC was efficient and found to be producing maximum current of 0. 84 mA, power density of 28. 15 mW/m 2 where as <b>double</b> <b>chambered</b> MFC produced a maximum current of 0. 36 mA and power density of 17. 76 mW/m 2. <b>Double</b> <b>chambered</b> MFC was efficient in the removal of COD (64 % removal) when compared with single chamber MFC which attained 61 % COD removal efficiency. The removal of dissolved solids in both single and <b>double</b> <b>chambered</b> MFC was found to be 48 %. Five varied feed concentrations were loaded to both the single and <b>double</b> <b>chambered</b> MFC and the systems were stable. The COD and dissolved solids removal observed in distillery wastewater might be attributed to the microbial catalyzed electrochemical reactions occurring in the anodic chamber of single and <b>double</b> <b>chambered</b> MFC...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Double</b> <b>chambered</b> right {{ventricle}} {{is a rare}} congenital cardiac anomaly {{in which}} the right ventricle {{is divided into two}} chambers by an anomalous muscle bundle. The diagnosis of this disorder is difficult in adults. Calcification of the tricuspid valve is extremely rare, and very few cases have been reported. Most cases of tricuspid valve calcification had a congenital disorder with high pressure in the right ventricle. Case presentation We report a rare case of a 71 -year-old Japanese woman who presented with chest discomfort, and was found to have a <b>double</b> <b>chambered</b> right ventricle with severe calcification of the tricuspid valve. This abnormality was found by echocardiography, and the diagnosis was confirmed by multislice cardiac computerized tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and cardiac catheterization. Our patient rejected surgical repair, and medical therapy with carvedilol was effective to reduce her symptoms. Conclusion Calcification of the tricuspid valve is extremely rare, and considered to be due to high pressure in the right ventricle. To the best of our knowledge, there are no other reported cases of this combination of <b>double</b> <b>chambered</b> right ventricle and calcification of the tricuspid valve. </p...|$|R
60|$|He {{was young}} and strong, or he never could have {{executed}} with such zest the undertakings to which he now applied himself, since they involved reading {{most of the night}} after working all the day. First he bought a shaded lamp for four and six-pence, and obtained a good light. Then he got pens, paper, and such other necessary books as he had been unable to obtain elsewhere. Then, to the consternation of his landlady, he shifted all the furniture of his room--a single one for living and sleeping--rigged up a curtain on a rope across the middle, to make a <b>double</b> <b>chamber</b> out of one, hung up a thick blind that nobody should know how he was curtailing the hours of sleep, laid out his books, and sat down.|$|E
6000|$|It was a {{large and}} lofty room in which the young baronet found himself. The carpet was so soft and thick that his feet made no sound as he walked across it. The two gas jets were turned only half-way up, and the dim light with the faint {{aromatic}} smell which filled the air had a vaguely religious suggestion. He {{sat down in a}} shining leather armchair by the smouldering fire and looked gloomily about him. Two sides of the room were taken up with books, fat and sombre, with broad gold lettering upon their backs. Beside him was the high, old-fashioned mantelpiece of white marble--the top of it strewed with cotton wadding and bandages, graduated measures, and little bottles. There was one with a broad neck just above him containing bluestone, and another narrower one with what looked like the ruins of a broken pipestem and [...] "Caustic" [...] outside upon a red label. Thermometers, hypodermic syringes bistouries and spatulas were scattered about both on the mantelpiece and on the central table {{on either side of the}} sloping desk. On the same table, to the right, stood copies of the five books which Dr. Horace Selby had written upon the subject with which his name is peculiarly associated, while on the left, on the top of a red medical directory, lay a huge glass model of a human eye the size of a turnip, which opened down the centre to expose the lens and <b>double</b> <b>chamber</b> within.|$|E

50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>chamber</b> sealers {{require the}} entire product {{to be placed}} in a plastic bag within the machine. Once the product is placed in the machine on the seal bar, the lid is closed and air is removed. Then a seal bar inside the chamber seals the product in the bag, after sealing the bag the chamber is {{refilled}} with air by the automatic opening of a vent to the outside. This oncoming pressure squeezes all remaining air in the bag. The lid is then opened and the product removed. <b>Double</b> <b>chamber</b> sealers are typically used for medium-volume packaging, and also have the capability to vacuum seal liquids. The lid generally swings from one side to another, increasing production speed over a single chamber model. <b>Double</b> <b>chamber</b> vacuum packaging machines generally have either spring-weighted lids or fully automatic lids.|$|E
