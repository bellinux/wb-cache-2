There are two contributions in the proposed <b>improvement</b> <b>scheme.</b> One is to exchange the sequence of compression and encryption. The other is to adopt XOR and substitution operations for encryption. Hence, the improvements on encryption time, compression ratio and security are possible...|$|R
