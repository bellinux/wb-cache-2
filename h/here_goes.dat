2500|$|The exact {{definition}} of the civitas probably corresponded at least roughly {{to the area of}} the large medieval Catholic diocese of Liège, which was reduced in 1559. Many early medieval dioceses were based upon older Roman provinces. And it is known that this diocese saw itself as the diocese of the Civitas Tungrorum. However, doubts exist about exact borders in this case {{due to the fact that}} the northern part of the civitas was for a long time pagan Frankish, and outside of Roman or Catholic influence. Edith Wightman, considering the question of the locations of the tribes Caesar originally met <b>here,</b> <b>goes</b> as far as saying that this region [...] "had the least stable political situation of any within later Belgica, and since the pattern was repeated in the Middle Ages, bishopric boundaries are of no help".|$|E

I have had the most amazing time and I have learnt so much. It was important that my record was personal to me. I {{wanted to be able to}} look back on the album and know that I have honestly put 100% of myself into it. I've written songs and stories that I have wanted to write for a long time. I really hope that you're able to relate to my music, because that really is what it's all about.. So <b>here</b> <b>goes,</b> I'm taking a big leap, but it's going to be the best fun ever.|$|E
