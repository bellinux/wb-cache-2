40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} police raids at nuisance bars on drug dealing {{in and around the}} nuisance bar. We examine effects of both dosage (number of raids) and duration of the intervention, as well as the conditioning effects of land use and population characteristics in shaping the underlying risk levels of drug dealing in the target and surrounding <b>displacement</b> <b>areas.</b> Results indicate that the police intervention does suppress levels of drug dealing during periods of active enforcement, but these effects largely disappear when the intervention is withdrawn. Also, the effects of the intervention are mediated by risk characteristics in target and <b>displacement</b> <b>areas.</b> In general, target areas characterized by higher levels of risk are more resistant to intervention effects than those with lower levels or risk. Risk factors in nearby <b>displacement</b> <b>areas</b> are also significant.

The obtained surface displacement maps show that the ground around Mount Sounzan moved to the east (<b>Displacement</b> <b>area</b> B) and the area between Mounts Kamiyama and Sounzan subsided (<b>Displacement</b> <b>area</b> C). Carrying out a nonlinear inversion based on the displacements obtained by two of the four pairs, we found that a combination model of an open crack and a deflation sill is better than a model of an open crack only. The estimated volume changes of the open crack and the sill were 1.14 [*]×[*] 105  m 3 (inflation) and 0.49 [*]×[*] 105  m 3 (deflation), respectively. In addition to the source model, a localized swelling detected in Owakudani (Displacement A) was also modeled as a point source.

As a gravity sensor, the vestibular system is one {{of the most}} important tools of the nervous system in the control of the posture.

The present study had as objective to correlate the results of the postural control evaluation in young people obtained through the Foam-Laser Dynamic Posturography (FLP) and force platform. For the accomplishment of the study, 31 volunteers were invited (19 men and 11 women) who were submitted to the evaluation of the postural control through the Dynamic Foam-Laser Posturography and force platform simultaneously. The results reveled that there was strong correlation among the values obtained in the sensory organization tests (SOT) and pressure center (PC) <b>displacement</b> <b>area</b> on force platform in all TOS.

40|$|Aims: To {{assess the}} longer-term {{effects of the}} 2014 NSW liquor law reforms on levels of {{violence}} in the inner Sydney area. Method: Interrupted time series models were used {{to examine the effects of}} the legislative reforms introduced in January 2014. Police recorded non-domestic assaults were analysed over the period January 2009 and September 2016. Separate analyses were carried out for the Kings Cross Precinct (KXP); the Sydney CBD Entertainment Precinct (CBD); an area contiguous with KXP and CBD called the proximal <b>displacement</b> <b>area</b> (PDA); a group of entertainment areas not far from KXP and CBD called the distal <b>displacement</b> <b>area</b> (DDA) and the rest of NSW. Results: Following the reforms statistically significant reductions in non-domestic assault incidents occurred in both the Kings Cross (down 49 %) and CBD Entertainment Precincts (down 13 %). There was evidence of geographical displacement to surrounding areas with increases in non-domestic assault observed in both the PDA (up 12 %) and the DDA (up 17 %). The reduction in the combined Kings Cross and CBD Precincts (930 fewer non-domestic assaults) was much greater than the increase in the combined proximal and displacement areas (299 more non-domestic assaults). Conclusion: Restrictions on the availability of alcohol appear to have reduced non-domestic assault in the target Precincts.

40|$|A common {{model for}} normal fault growth {{involves}} a single fault at depth splaying upwards {{into a series}} of en-echelon segments. This model is applied to faults as well as a range of extension fractures, including veins, joints and igneous dykes. Examples of splaying growth fault systems in the Columbus Basin, offshore Trinidad, are presented. They include the commonly described upwards splaying type, but also one fault zone with an upward change from disconnected overlapping synthetic faults to a continuous fault. One fault zone with high-displacement fault segments is separated by a relay ramp at depth, becomes breached higher up, developing into a continuous fault at its upper part, where displacements are least. This example suggests that whilst kinematic linkage typically precedes geometric linkage in the evolution of relay ramps, low-displacement parts of a fault system may be geometrically linked whereas higher <b>displacement</b> <b>areas</b> are only kinematically linked...|$|R

The findings showed that the center of pressure-CoP (<b>displacement,</b> <b>area</b> and length) had least motion at the baseline (0 ° Flat) platform condition that progressively increased as a function of platform angle in both facing up and down directions. The virtual time to collision (VTC) dynamics revealed that the spatio-temporal margins to the functional stability boundary were progressively smaller and the VTC time series also more regular (SampEn-Sample Entropy) as slope angle increased. Surface slope induces a restricted stability region with lower dimension VTC dynamics that is more constrained when postural orientation is facing down the slope. These findings provide further evidence that VTC acts as a control variable in standing posture that is influenced by the emergent dynamics of the individual-environment-task interaction...|$|E
