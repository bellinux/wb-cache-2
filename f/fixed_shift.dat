We establish a condition on the periodic points of X and Y that is necessary for Y to be the <b>fixed</b> point <b>shift</b> of an inert involution of X. We show that this condition is sufficient to realize Y as the <b>fixed</b> point <b>shift</b> of an involution, up to shift equivalence on X, if X is a shift of finite type with Artin-Mazur zeta function equivalent to 1 mod 2. Given an inert involution f of a mixing shift of finite type X, we characterize what f-invariant subshifts can be realized as the <b>fixed</b> point <b>shift</b> of an inert involution. 1. Introduction and Statement of Results. We refer the reader to Section 2 for precise definitions. The group of shift commuting homeomorphisms of a shift of finite type X is called the automorphism group (of X) and is denoted as Aut(σX). The group Aut(σX) has been a vital tool in attempts to classify shifts of finite type, but in general, Aut(σX) is large and mysterious.

40|$|Using the {{homogeneous}} {{electron gas}} (HEG) as a model, we investigate {{the sources of}} error in the `initiator' adaptation to Full Configuration Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (i-FCIQMC), {{with a view to}} accelerating convergence. In particular we find that the <b>fixed</b> <b>shift</b> phase, where the walker number is allowed to grow slowly, can be used to effectively assess stochastic and initiator error. Using this approach we provide simple explanations for the internal parameters of an i-FCIQMC simulation. We exploit the consistent basis sets and adjustable correlation strength of the HEG to analyze properties of the algorithm, and present finite basis benchmark energies for N= 14 over a range of densities 0. 5 ≤ r_s ≤ 5. 0 a. u. A single-point extrapolation scheme is introduced to produce complete basis energies for 14, 38 and 54 electrons. It is empirically found that, in the weakly correlated regime, the computational cost scales linearly with the plane wave basis set size, which is justifiable on physical grounds. We expect the <b>fixed</b> <b>shift</b> strategy to reduce the computational cost of many calculations of weakly correlated systems. In addition, we provide benchmarks for the electron gas, to be used by other quantum chemical methods in exploring periodic solid state systems. Comment: 16 pages, 22 figure...|$|E

We make this point in a simple linear tax setting {{with a population of}} agents differing in terms of productivities, labor supply elasticities, and costs of income shifting. In the most empirically plausible scenario when people who shift easily are also more elastic in labor supply, giving them a lower tax rate is a good thing. This mechanism may be compared to third degree price discrimination in industrial organization. Numerical simulations suggest that <b>fixed</b> <b>shifting</b> costs have a large impact on optimal taxes.

Endometriosis may be elevated in night shift workers, but evidence is only preliminary. Adequate data are lacking to assess associations between night shift work and infertility or time to pregnancy.
