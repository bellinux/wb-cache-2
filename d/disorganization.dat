5|$|Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, {{and control}} of {{criminal}} activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, psychology, and the behavioural sciences. The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate norms, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; {{and how they are}} enforced. The concept of social <b>disorganization</b> is when the broader social systems leads to violations of norms. For instance, Robert K. Merton produced a typology of deviance, which includes both individual and system level causal explanations of deviance.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{years after}} the 1917 Russian Revolution, Du Bois {{extended}} a trip to Europe to include {{a visit to the}} Soviet Union. Du Bois was struck by the poverty and <b>disorganization</b> he encountered in the Soviet Union, yet was impressed by the intense labors of the officials and by the recognition given to workers. Although Du Bois was not yet familiar with the communist theories of Karl Marx or Vladimir Lenin, he concluded that socialism may be a better path towards racial equality than capitalism.|$|E
5|$|Apparently formidable, the Libyan {{military}} disposition in Chad was {{marred by}} serious flaws. The Libyans were prepared for a war {{in which they would}} provide ground and air support to their Chadian allies, act as assault infantry, and provide reconnaissance. By 1987, however, Muammar Gaddafi had lost his allies, exposing Libya's inadequate knowledge of the area. Libyan garrisons came to resemble isolated and vulnerable islands in the Chadian Sahara. Also important was the low morale among the troops, who were fighting in a foreign country, and the structural <b>disorganization</b> of the Libyan army, which was in part induced by Gaddafi's fear of a military coup against him. This fear led him to avoid the professionalization of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|By 20:00, Scheer {{ordered the}} German line to {{complete}} a 180-degree turn eastward to disengage from the British fleet. The maneuver, conducted under heavy fire, caused <b>disorganization</b> in the German fleet. Kaiserin had come too close to Prinzregent Luitpold {{and was forced to}} haul out of line to starboard to avoid a collision. The latter vessel came up alongside Kaiserin at high speed. As a result, Kaiserin had to remain out of line and could not return to her assigned position. The turn reversed the order of the German line; Kaiserin was now the seventh ship {{from the rear of the}} German line. At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized into the night cruising formation. Kaiserin was the eleventh ship, in the center of the 24-ship line.|$|E

5|$|Milk's {{continuing}} campaign, {{run from}} the storefront of Castro Camera, was a study in <b>disorganization.</b> Although the older Irish grandmothers and gay men who volunteered were plentiful and happy to send out mass mailings, Milk's notes and volunteer lists were kept on scrap papers. Any time the campaign required funds, the money came from the cash register without any consideration for accounting. The campaign manager's assistant was an 11-year-old neighborhood girl. Milk himself was hyperactive and prone to fantastic outbursts of temper, only to recover quickly and shout excitedly about something else. Many of his rants were directed at his lover, Scott Smith, who was becoming disillusioned {{with the man who}} was no longer the laid-back hippie he had fallen in love with.|$|E
5|$|While RAD {{is likely}} to occur {{following}} neglectful and abusive childcare, {{there should be no}} automatic diagnosis on this basis alone as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect. Abuse can occur alongside the required factors but on its own does not explain attachment disorder. Experiences of abuse are associated with the development of disorganised attachment, in which the child prefers a familiar caregiver, but responds to that person in an unpredictable and somewhat bizarre way. Within official classifications, attachment <b>disorganization</b> is a risk factor but not in itself an attachment disorder. Further although attachment disorders tend to occur in the context of some institutions, repeated changes of primary caregiver or extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{reinforcements}} poured in. The {{rest of the}} 27th Infantry moved in, as well as {{a battalion}} from the 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd US Infantry Division. These were able to push North Korean infiltrators out of Yongsan and back to their firmly held positions at Cloverleaf Hill. On August 14, following an artillery barrage, Task Force Hill launched a direct assault on these positions. Fighting continued the entire day in a fierce series of attacks and counterattacks in which both sides, already at far reduced strength, inflicted large numbers of casualties. However, Task Force Hill's second attack was just as unsuccessful as its first. Casualties among officers was high in the fight, and the <b>disorganization</b> that followed meant most of the units in the fight could not communicate to coordinate any large actions. It became a battle of attrition by August 15 as neither 4th North Korean Division nor Task Force Hill were able to get the upper hand in the fight, which in several cases erupted in desperate hand-to-hand combat. Casualties mounted and a frustrated Walker ordered the 5,000-man 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the area to turn the tide. The brigade moved from the Masan region {{in the middle of a}} counteroffensive being conducted by the 25th US Infantry.|$|E
5|$|Due to land {{interaction}} and its eyewall replacement cycle, Hurricane John weakened to a 105mph (170km/h) hurricane by late on August 31, but restrengthened {{to a major}} hurricane shortly after as its eye became better defined. After completing another eyewall replacement cycle, the hurricane again weakened to Category2 status, and on September 1, it made landfall on Cabo del Este on {{the southern tip of}} Baja California Sur with winds of 110mph (180km/h). John passed near La Paz as a weakening Category1 hurricane on September 2, and weakened to a tropical storm shortly thereafter over land. John continued to weaken, and late on September 3, the system deteriorated to a tropical depression while still over land. By September 4, most of the convection decoupled from the circulation towards mainland Mexico, and a clear circulation had not been discernible for 24hours. Based on the <b>disorganization</b> of the system, the National Hurricane Center issued its last advisory on the system.|$|E
5|$|The ROK <b>disorganization</b> was {{so great}} {{in the face of}} {{continued}} North Korean pressure that Task Force Jackson could not launch its planned attack. The US 21st Infantry was in an assembly area north of An'gang-ni and ready for an attack the morning of the 28th, but during the night the ROK 17th Regiment lost its position on the high ridge northward at the bend of the Kigye valley, and the attack was canceled. The South Koreans regained their position in the afternoon but that night lost it again. At the same time, elements of the NK 5th Division penetrated the ROK 3rd Division southwest of P'ohang-dong. Coulter directed the 21st Infantry to repel this penetration. During the day on August 29, B Company, 21st Infantry, supported by a platoon of tanks of B Company, 73rd Medium Tank Battalion, successfully counterattacked northwest from the southern edge of P'ohang-dong for a distance of , with South Korean troops following. The American units then withdrew to P'ohang-dong. That night the ROK's withdrew, and the next day an American infantry-tank force repeated the action of the day before. The 21st Infantry then took over from the ROK 3rd Division a sector extending north and northwest of P'ohang-dong.|$|E
5|$|Thought {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) of thought. Thought process cannot be {{directly}} observed but {{can only be described}} by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of thought, some people may experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or <b>disorganization</b> of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and might be described more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment of thought, or knight's move thinking. Thought may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E
5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a subtropical cyclone, Andrea was {{embedded within a}} large, nearly stationary deep-layer trough, resulting in a westward movement. Drifting over sea surface temperatures {{of no more than}} 77°F (25°C), the organization of the system deteriorated with a significant decrease in convection. By early on May 10, much of the associated weather was located to the east of the cyclone within a band of moderate convection due to a brief spell of westerly vertical wind shear. The center of circulation had become disorganized, with several small cloud swirls within the larger circulation. This <b>disorganization</b> of the center, combined with increasing wind shear and dry air suppressing convective activity, caused it to begin weakening later that morning. By 1500UTC on May 10, only a few thunderstorms remained near the center, and thus the NHC downgraded Andrea to subtropical depression status. Though a few intermittent thunderstorms persisted over the eastern semicircle, the depression remained disorganized and weak; the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on May 11, after it had been without significant deep convection for 18hours about 80miles (125km) northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida.|$|E
5|$|The Union flanks {{were being}} pushed back, but not decisively. Hardee and Polk caused Sherman and McClernand on the Union right to retreat in the {{direction}} of Pittsburg Landing, leaving the right flank of the Hornet's Nest exposed. Just after Johnston's death, Breckinridge, whose corps had been in reserve, attacked on the extreme left of the Union line, driving off the understrength brigade of Col. David Stuart and potentially opening a path into the Union rear and the Tennessee River. However, the Confederates paused to regroup and recover from exhaustion and <b>disorganization,</b> then followed the sounds of the guns toward the Hornet's Nest, and an opportunity was lost. After the Hornet's Nest fell, the remnants of the Union line established a solid three-mile (5km) front around Pittsburg Landing, extending west from the river and then north, up the River Road, keeping the approach open for the expected, although belated, arrival of Lew Wallace's division. Sherman commanded the right of the line, McClernand took the center, and on the left, the remnants of W. H. L. Wallace's, Hurlbut's, and Stuart's men mixed with thousands of stragglers who were crowding on the bluff over the landing. The advance of Buell's army, Col. Jacob Ammen's brigade of Bull Nelson's division, arrived in time to be ferried over and join the left end of the line. The defensive line included a ring of more than 50 cannons and naval guns from the river (the gunboats USS Lexington and USS Tyler). A final Confederate charge of two brigades, led by Brig. Gen. Withers, attempted to break through the line but was repulsed. Beauregard called off a second attempt after 6 p.m., as the sun set. The Confederate plan had failed; they had pushed Grant east to a defensible position on the river, not forced him west into the swamps.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} this {{migration}} have been observed {{in the ruins of}} burial sites left behind by the Iazyges, in that they lacked the standard items of gold being buried alongside a person, and even lacked the gear of a warrior. One explanation for this was that the Iazyges were no longer in contact with the Pontic Steppe, and thus cut off from all trade with them, which had previously been a vital part of their economy. Another problem the Iazyges had with their new location was that it lacked both precious minerals and metals, such as iron, that could be turned into weapons. The Iazyges found that it was much harder to raid the Romans, due to them having organized armies around the area, as opposed to the <b>disorganization</b> of the armies of their previous neighbors. Due to their trade with the Pontic Steppe being cut off, they could no longer trade for gold for burial sites, assuming any of them could afford it. The only such goods they could find were the pottery and metals of the Dacian and Celtic peoples near them. Iron weapons would have been exceedingly rare, if the Iazyges even had them, and would likely have been passed down from father to son, rather than buried, because it could not have been replaced.|$|E
5|$|Without {{support from}} the Europeans, some Franks in Outremer, {{particularly}} the Knights Hospitaller of the fortress of Marqab, {{and to some extent}} the Franks of Cyprus and Antioch, attempted to join in combined operations with the Mongols in 1280–1281. The death of the Egyptian leader Baibars in 1277 led to <b>disorganization</b> in the Muslim territories, making conditions ripe for a new action by other factions in the Holy Land. The Mongols seized the opportunity, organized a new invasion of Syria, and in September 1280 occupied Bagras and Darbsak, followed by Aleppo on October 20. The Mongol leader Abaqa, taking advantage of his momentum, sent envoys to Edward I of England, the Franks of Acre, King Hugh of Cyprus, and Bohemond VII of Tripoli (son of Bohemond VI), requesting their support for the campaign. But the Crusaders were not organized enough themselves to be of much help. In Acre, the Patriarch's Vicar replied that the city was suffering from hunger, and that the king of Jerusalem was already embroiled in another war. Local Knights Hospitaller from Marqab (in the area which had previously been Antioch/Tripoli) were able to make raids into the Beqaa Valley, as far as the Mamluk-held Krak des Chevaliers in 1280 and 1281. Hugh and Bohemond of Antioch mobilized their armies, but their forces were prevented from joining those of the Mongols by Baibars' successor, the new Egyptian Sultan Qalawun. He advanced north from Egypt in March 1281, positioned his own army between the Franks and Mongols, and then further divided the potential allies by renewing a truce with the Barons of Acre on , extending it for another ten years and ten months (a truce he would later breach). He also renewed a second 10-year truce with Bohemond VII of Tripoli on , and affirmed pilgrim access to Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|These events {{led to a}} demoralization and <b>disorganization</b> of {{the police}} in the city. Between the years 1905 and 1906 there were seven police chiefs. The police did not enter Surazh Street, which was {{considered}} a stronghold of anarchists.|$|E
25|$|From October 1866 until July 1867, all {{offensive}} {{operations were}} suspended. Military operations {{were limited to}} skirmishes with the Paraguayans and bombarding Curupaity.

25|$|It is also {{possible}} that problems with binding give way to the fractured mental state that is characteristic of schizophrenia. Schizophrenic patients experience a “disintegration of consciousness” which involves hallucinations, delusions, and generally disordered thinking. It is hypothesized that this mental <b>disorganization</b> is caused by underlying neural <b>disorganization</b> due to disordered binding, which is then further complicated by the occurrence of complex mental processes in this disordered state. This can essentially be viewed as a pathological rise in the neural complexity of the brain. The dissociative symptoms and disorganized speech associated with schizophrenia are consistent with this idea. It is {{also possible}} that disordered binding between the regulatory mechanisms of the brain gives rise to a lack of synchronized activation of its neural networks.|$|E
25|$|In 1995 COPECAS, in {{collaboration}} with other principal institutions, conducted a country-wide analysis of water and sanitation to address <b>disorganization,</b> contradictions and discrepancies in the sector. This study led {{to changes in the}} coordination and management of the sector, such as giving INFOM the responsibility to manage the sector.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture wasn't {{destroyed}} by the civil war, but the <b>disorganization</b> of the exports destroyed the food industry and reduced the peasants' incomes. Furthermore, prodrazvyorstka and then the natural food tax contributed to growing discontent. In 1920–1924 there was a number of anti-communistic riots in rural areas, with up to 40,000 people involved.|$|E
25|$|Wolfpak {{began in}} 2001 when leader Kala Alexander moved to North Shore {{in search for}} job opportunities, and found <b>disorganization</b> and lack of respect in the surf lineup at surf reef break, Pipeline. Alexander found it {{necessary}} to dictate organization in who would surf the Pipeline to both preserve the value, and also protect surfers from the reef’s potentially life-threatening waves.|$|E
25|$|On November 18, after {{a period}} of <b>disorganization</b> during which it {{appeared}} to be dissipating, the system strengthened and was upgraded to a tropical storm off the coast of Honduras and given the name Gamma. There, its torrential rainfall triggered deadly landslides. Gamma's winds and rains also reached into Belize, where they were less deadly. The storm dissipated on November 22, having killed 39people.|$|E
25|$|The Gauls camped at the Anio river, {{carrying}} {{loads of}} recently captured plunder. Near them, at the Alban Hills, Camillus discovered their <b>disorganization,</b> which {{was due to}} unruly celebrations. Therefore, before the dawn, the Roman light infantry disrupted the Gallic defences and, subsequently, the Roman heavy infantry and pikemen finished off their enemy. After the battle, Velitrae surrendered voluntarily to Rome. Back in Rome, Camillus celebrated with another Triumph.|$|E
25|$|Historians do {{not believe}} that Indian {{casualties}} approached the higher estimates. The Plains Indians rarely mounted a direct charge at a foe capable of defense. Rather, they struck at the rear and flanks of an opponent, using mounted mobility to probe for weaknesses and attempt to cause <b>disorganization</b> and panic, backing off if they encountered a stout defense, and closing in for the kill when they could do so with little risk of heavy casualties.|$|E
25|$|Some unorthodox economists like Stephen Kanitz {{attribute}} {{the debt crisis}} not to the high Brazilian level of indebtedness nor to the <b>disorganization</b> of the country's economy. They say {{that the cause of}} the crisis was rather a minor error in the U.S. government banking regulations which forbids its banks from lending over ten times the amount of their capital, a regulation that, when the inflation eroded their lending limits, forced them to cut the access of underdeveloped countries to international savings.|$|E
25|$|Many {{individuals}} arrested experienced prolonged pretrial detention, often {{ranging from}} months to years. MONUC reported that 70 to 80 percent of detainees nationwide were in pretrial detention. Prison officials often held individuals long after their sentences had expired due to <b>disorganization,</b> judicial inefficiency, or corruption. In several instances when NGOs or MONUC brought cases {{to the attention}} of the government, prison officials released them. Armed groups operating outside government control in parts of the east sometimes detained civilians, often for ransom.|$|E
25|$|During {{the rule}} of Ahmad Bey (r.1837-1855) {{extensive}} modern reforms were initiated. Later, in 1861 Tunisia promulgated the first constitution in the Arab world. Yet the Tunisian drive toward modernizing {{the state and the}} economy met resistance. Reformers became frustrated by comfort-seeking insiders, political <b>disorganization,</b> regional discontent, and rural poverty. An 1864 revolt in the Sahil region was brutally put down. Later, after ineffective measures had failed, the leading reformer Khair al-Din (Khaïreddine) became chief minister 1873–1877, but he too eventually met defeat by wily conservative politicians.|$|E
25|$|The short novel Laughter and Grief (Sovremennaya letopis, March–May, 1871), {{a strong}} social {{critique}} {{focusing on the}} fantastic <b>disorganization</b> and incivility of Russian life and commenting on the sufferings of individuals in a repressive society proved to be his last; from then on Leskov avoided the genre of the orthodox novel. In November 1872, though, he adapted Victor Hugo's Toilers of the Sea for children. Five years later Józef Ignacy Kraszewski's The Favourites of King August came out, translated from the Polish and edited by Leskov.|$|E
25|$|Liu Xiu {{was one of}} {{the many}} {{descendants}} of the Han imperial family. Following the usurpation of the Han throne by Wang Mang and the ensuing civil war during the disintegration of Wang's short-lived Xin Dynasty, he emerged as one of several descendants of the fallen dynasty claiming the imperial throne. After assembling forces and proclaiming himself emperor in the face of competitors, he was able to defeat his rivals, destroy the peasant army of the Chimei, known for their <b>disorganization</b> and marauding, and finally reunify the whole of China in AD 36.|$|E
25|$|The Hephthalites were {{a strong}} {{military}} power but they lacked {{the organization to}} fight on multiple fronts. The Persians and the Western Turkic Khaganate made an alliance and in 557 launched a two pronged attack on the Hephthalites, taking advantage of their <b>disorganization</b> and disunity. As a result, the Turkic tribes took the territory north of the Oxus river, while the Persians annexed land to the south. According to the medieval Arab historian al-Masudi, Khosrow had before this event campaigned deeply in Hephthalite territory, where he killed their king Khushnavaz (also known as Akhshunvar or Akhshunwar) at Khuttal.|$|E
25|$|Relationship {{issues have}} been {{consistently}} linked {{to the development of}} mental disorders, with continuing debate on the relative impact of the home environment or work/school and peer groups. Issues with parenting skills or parental depression or other problems may be a risk factor. Parental divorce appears to increase risk, perhaps only if there is family discord or <b>disorganization,</b> although a warm supportive relationship with one parent may compensate. Details of infant feeding, weaning, toilet training etc. {{do not appear to be}} importantly linked to psychopathology. Early social privation, or lack of ongoing, harmonious, secure, committed relationships, have been implicated in the development of mental disorders.|$|E
25|$|Shaba I was a {{conflict}} in Zaire's Shaba (Katanga) Province lasting from March 8, 1977, to May 26, 1977. The conflict {{began when the}} Front for the National Liberation of the Congo (FNLC), {{a group of about}} 2,000 Katangan Congolese soldiers (veterans of the Congo Crisis, the Angolan War of Independence, and the Angolan Civil War) crossed the border into Shaba from Angola. The FNLC made quick progress through the region, due to sympathizing locals and to the <b>disorganization</b> of the Zairian military (Forces Armées Zaïroises, or FAZ). Traveling east from Zaire's border with Angola, the rebels reached Mutshatsha, a small town near to the key mining town of Kolwezi.|$|E
25|$|The Community of Christ today {{considers}} {{the period from}} 1830 to 1844 {{to be a part}} of its early history and from 1844, the year of the death of the founder, to 1860, to be a period of <b>disorganization.</b> Since 1844, the doctrines and practices of the Community of Christ have evolved separately from the other denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement. Since the 1960s, the church's proselytizing outside North America forced a re-assessment and a gradual evolution of its practices and beliefs. Some changes included the ordination of women to the priesthood, open communion, and changing the church's name from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints to the current name in April 2001.|$|E
25|$|On July 16, Colonel Prescott {{assembled}} 1200 {{men from}} various regiments and companies, acting on orders from General Artemas Ward, and departed from Cambridge at 9:00 that evening. Putnam had procured the various entrenching tools and materials needed for building the fortifications, had them loaded into wagons, {{and proceeded to}} Charlestown with Prescott. There was some <b>disorganization</b> among the colonial troops, some of them with no commanding officers to lead them, along with disagreement {{among some of the}} officers as to how and where to prepare for battle. After a two-hour meeting at Charlestown Neck, Putnam and Colonel Richard Gridley, an army engineer, had persuaded Prescott to fortify Breeds Hill rather than Bunker Hill as originally planned.|$|E
25|$|A United Nations Special Rapporteur {{undertook}} {{a mission to}} Mexico in 2002 to investigate reports by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights that the country's judiciary and administration of law was not independent. During {{the course of his}} visit to a number of cities, the rapporteur observed that corruption in the judiciary had not been reduced significantly. One of the principal issues is that, because the federal courts operate at a relatively high level, most citizens are compelled to seek justice in the inadequate state courts. Additionally, the rapporteur expressed concerns about such issues as <b>disorganization</b> in the legal profession, difficulties and harassment faced by lawyers, poor trial procedures, poor access to the justice system for indigenous peoples and minors, and lacklustre investigation of many crimes.|$|E

In 1915, he was appointed as aide-de-camp to the commander in chief and Nicholas II employed him as supervisor of operations. In this position, he had to report to the Emperor about the general situation on the front.
