At the same time it would lead to a reduction in the extreme motion response, resulting in heave and pitch oscillation heights of 7 m and 19 ° and surge excursion of 12 m.

The metalized tetroons were positioned at 1 -min. intervals {{by means of a}} manually operated SP- 1 M radar. From knowledge of these positions, overlapping 5 -min. average velocities were determined for flight durations of up to 5 hr.

With the addition of this mesh, flights at altitudes of less than 5, 000 ft. were tracked as far as 92 n. mi. from the radar, or approximately to the radar horizon. Spectral analysis of the velocity data obtained from the four best flights shows some evidence for a (Lagrangian) wind speed periodicity of 26 -min. period, a vertical motion periodicity of 13 -min. period, and a cross-stream velocity periodicity of 17 -min. period. Cross spectrum analysis shows that, with the exception of oscillations of 45 -min. period, the wind speed is at a maximum ahead of the trough in the trajectory. Thus, if the large-scale air flow is nearly geostrophic, there is evidence that kinetic energy and momentum are transported down the pressure gradient by these small-scale oscillations.

40|$|The geobag {{embankment}} constructed at Kapp Amsterdam {{is part of}} {{an ongoing}} research by SINTEF related to exploration of suitability for use of geobags for coastal erosion protection in the Arctic. Erosion rates in the Arctic are often high and the lack of proper local masses for erosion protection creates the need for alternative solutions. The actions on the embankment caused by the surrounding ice need to be mapped whereas theyc onstitute one of the important features related to Arctic environments, alongside permafrost. It is of essential importance for the functionality of the geobags that the problems caused by the ice are manageable. Field work was performed at the site to gather data on features that influence actions from ice, including physical and mechanical properties. Some laboratory work was also included for supplemental measurements. The months of February to April were spent on the landfast ice sheet for data collection and monitoring of developments in the surrounding ice. During the field work,help was provided by more experienced PhD-students. The investigations focused especially on tidal influence. This involved investigating for any difference in the zone of tidal influence, called the hingezone, compared with the level ice zone further out. The peak level ice thickness during February to April was 0. 67 m. Stefan’s law failed to predict the ice thickness growth. A coefficient of 0. 14 had to be used to fit the observed growth. This is lower than for previous years which have indicated a coefficient of 0. 3 - 0. 4 (Høyland, 2009). Variations in horizontal compressive strengths of the ice were measured in both the level ice zoneand the hinge zone. The maximum compressive strength measured was 5. 3 MPa which was for the level ice. The highest strength found in the topmost part of the hinge zone was 2. 0 MPa. Lowertemperature and salinity would indicate higher strength in the hinge zone, but high porosity seemsto counter this. 3 days of horizontal stress measurements in the ice {{on both sides of the}} upper tidal crack in the hingezone gave a maximum value of 100 kPa in compression, occurring on the sea side. The results from the land side gave negative values, indicating that there was mainly tension on this side. Fluctuations of about 25 kPa on both sides correlated clearly with tide. Other stress constituents as thermal expansion or drag forces were not identified. The vertical positions of 5 points from the level ice and up through the hinge zone were measured during half a tidal cycle. The free <b>floating</b> <b>level</b> ice was displaced 0. 74 m which correlated with the estimate of fluctuation in water level from the Longyearbyen tide table, taken from Caline (2010). Expectedly, displacements of the ice further into to hinge zone decreased with decreasing distance from land. The pattern of cracks formed in the hinge zone stayed relatively unchanged during the period of observations, indicating relation to tidal movement. Applied theory based bending of the ice sheet due to fluctuations in water level, overestimated the distances between the major cracks by around 50 - 75 %, indicating that the ice was weaker than assumed in the input parameters for the calculations. The obtained field work results have been compared with results from previous work. Theory from relevant literature has also been applied when available, though the work of this has crossed the intersection between land and sea making it challenging to find specific literature for support. Nevertheless, sampling and in-situ measurements have proved valuable results. These have made up a substantial foundation for assessment of the significance related to influence from ice actions. It seems that the landfast ice cover constitutes a small load on the embankment as the ice breaks from creep. However, the periods of ice build-up and break-up may cause another problem than what is monitored and analyzed here. The problem relates to bag rupture from free floating pieces ofice periods of ice build-up and break-up, as experienced by Gadd (1980). Bag rupture is regarded asgreater concern than displacements. Regarding overall stability the results indicate that ice actions are less of a problem compared withwave forces and stability issues related permafrost soil. </p...|$|E

Bu çalısmanın yola çıkış noktası olarak motorların yağlanması, motorun ömrüne doğrudan etki eden kritik bir faktör olması nedeniyle, sıvı seviyesini dinamik olarak ölçebilen bir sensöre ihtiyaç duyulmuştur.

The {{discovery}} of new {{materials and the}} technological developments in electronics have changed the whole industry and the world. Today sensors are being used nearly in every application of aeration, space, naval, automotive, civil, mechanical, industrial, electronics and computer engineering as well as advanced medicine, medical sciences and many other areas, and led to innovations and advances to every process when used. The study has started with the need of highly sensitive, compact liquid level measurement sensor {{which can be used}} even in flammable medium. To provide the demand, the positive and negative features and aspects of the current sensors, the literature and similar studies have been investigated. At first, a valid ultrasonic liquid level sensor has been analyzed to meet the requirements by improving its characteristics. For improving and solving the problems of the current sensor, finite element analysis has been performed until reaching a new model, which can be used to build the initial production prototypes. Although consideration of the results has shown that to meet all of the targets, a new and highly sensitive liquid levels sensor has to be developed, which should be the next step of the study. When looking through the techniques of the liquid level detection, it has been seen that there is a wide variety of detection methods. Some of them are: sensors working mechanically with Archimedes’ principle, <b>floating</b> <b>level</b> sensors, magnetic liquid level indicators, liquid level sensors using ultrasound and lambda waves to measure the flight time of the waves, Nuclear level switches using low level radiations emitted by radioactive sources, and various optical detection methods. In some of the optic applications, optic sensors are located at top or bottom level according to liquid existence and some of the fiber optic based systems measure the liquid level by the change of the refractive index. Other than these, when investigating some other common sensors, capacitive pressure measurement systems based on principle that measures the pressure change between the capasitor plates, strain gage systems which measure the pressure by shape changes, load cell type systems and piezoelectric pressure measuring systems has been evaluated. These systems usually have sensitivity problems. As an example, ultrasonic liquid level systems in automotive applications have ± 1 mm liquid height sensitivity values, while most of the precise pressure measurement sensors are sensitive to measure 50 - 100 kpa. The theory of this study was found many years ago when it was seen that sound waves in whispering tone bounce along the circular gallery of St Paul s Cathedral with very little loss, and this phenomenon was named as Whispering Gallery Mode (WGM). Today WGM theory has been introduced into modern electronics, and as a result, it has become an advanced theory including optical physics and electronics. In modern WGM applications, when laser light comes into the microsphere in its contact point with the tapered film, the light undergoes total internal reflections in the sphere. After repeated total internal reflections at the curved boundary, the electromagnetic field can close on itself and a resonance occurs on the light signal going to the photodiode. More importantly these resonances change when there is a change on the refractive index or geometry. The resonance frequencies shift with the changes of the microsphere size and/or the optical properties of the surrounding medium. One of the biggest advantages of the WGM theory is that very small values such as 10 - 5 N can be detected by using this method. For evaluating the possibility of developing a higly sensitive novel liquid level sensor using WGM phenomenon Southern Methodist University Microsensors lab. has been visited. After many meetings and discussions, it has been considered that a new kind of highly sensitive liquid level sensor can be developed by using the WGM phenomenon, in the Micro sensors lab. facilities of Southern Methodist University, where the experiments of the novel sensor have been performed. The novel sensor shows that the dependence of WGM shifts to liquid levels can be assumed as perfectly linear all the measurement range without being affected by the amount of liquid in the container. A Pa change in liquid pressure, results as high as 3, 12 pm WGM shifts, which have been observed during the liquid level experiments. When the axis have been switched, it can be estimated that the values are ranging between 0, 033 - 0, 053 mm of water level per pm WGM shift of the Laser Spectrum, again with a perfect linear correlation. It has also been calculated that the total uncertainty of the experiments is assumed to be around ± 1, 12 %, which might be improved with the usage of equipment with higher accuracy. Also another advantage relies on the WGM phenomenon, in which this novel sensor can be worked in any environment without being affected by the availability of flammable liquids and gasses etc. As a result of this study, a novel high-tech laser-optic technology based liquid level measurement sensor has been designed which can be used in automotive, aerospace & aviation industries, medicine, defense, civil engineering, and many other fields.

In the conventional carburettor, a venturi in the airflow creates a lowered pressure and this is enough to encourage the flow of fuel through the metering jets. The flow rate is critically sensitive to the fuel pressure at the jet, i.e. the hydrostatic head owing to the depth of fuel between the jet and the <b>float</b> <b>level.</b> Any sloshing within the float chamber affected this. Fish's design kept the float chamber, but avoided the dependency of flow rate on fuel depth. The float chamber was sealed and pressurised by a ram air effect from the air inlet, which then caused fuel to flow through the metering jet. This flow rate was entirely independent of fuel level, but did remain approximately proportional to the mass airflow. The Fish carburettor was also sensitive to mass airflow, rather than volume airflow, making it self-compensating for changes due to temperature or altitude.|$|R
