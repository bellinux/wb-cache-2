50|$|The {{blacksmith}} lapwing {{occurs in}} association with wetlands of all sizes. Even very small damp areas caused by a spilling water trough can attract them. In South Africa they are most numerous in the mesic <b>grassland</b> <b>region,</b> less so in higher-rainfall grasslands. Like the crowned lapwing, this species may leave Zambia and Zimbabwe in years of high rainfall and return in dry years. It avoids mountains of any type.|$|E

50|$|Situated in {{the fertile}} <b>grassland</b> <b>region</b> - {{known as the}} Baie des Veys - which {{constitutes}} the joint estuary of four rivers, Isigny is an important centre of the dairy industry.

Oysters have been extensively cultivated in the nearby waters of the Baie des Veys since the mid 20th century. A major river, the Vire, passes through the commune.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the days}} of early {{agricultural}} settlement, the majority of Alberta's population has been concentrated in the parkland belt (mixed forest-grassland), a boomerang-shaped strip of land extending along the North Saskatchewan River from Lloydminster to Edmonton and then along the Rocky Mountain foothills south to Calgary. This area is slightly more humid and treed than the drier prairie (<b>grassland)</b> <b>region</b> called Palliser's Triangle to its south, and {{large areas of the}} south (the “Special Areas”) were depopulated during the droughts of the 1920s and 30s. The chernozem (black soil) of the parkland region is more agriculturally productive than the red and grey soils to the south. Urban development has also been most advanced in the parkland belt. Edmonton and Red Deer are parkland cities, while Calgary is on the parkland-prairie fringe. Lethbridge and Medicine Hat are prairie cities. Grande Prairie lies in the Peace River Country a parkland region (with isolated patches of prairie, hence the name) in the northwest isolated {{from the rest of the}} parkland by the forested Swan Hills. Fort McMurray is the only urbanized population centre in the boreal forest which covers much of the northern half of the province.|$|E
5000|$|The route {{starts off}} in Regina, {{the capital of}} the province. Hwy 11 begins at the {{junction}} with the Trans Canada Highway as a 7 km concurrency with Hwy 6. Besides being the provincial capital, Regina is a cultural and commercial metropole for both southern Saskatchewan and adjacent areas in the neighbouring American states of North Dakota and Montana. Hwy 11 begins in a moist mixed <b>grassland</b> <b>region</b> known as the Regina Plain ecoregion. Evraz Regina, a North American steel company formerly known as IPSCO, is located in the Sherwood Industrial Park (SIP) north of Regina. The final chapter for the namesake of the Louis Riel Trail occurred in Regina. It was here that Métis leader Louis Riel was tried and hung on September 18, 1885 for treason. In the spring of 2008, Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell proclaimed in Duck Lake, that [...] "the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Resistance is an excellent opportunity {{to tell the story of}} the prairie Métis and First Nations peoples' struggle with Government forces and how it has shaped Canada today." [...] The length of the route is an asphalt concrete primary weight highway which is part of the national highway system (NHS) The Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure (SHS) South Central Planning Committee manages the construction and maintenance of the highway near Regina which handles approximately 11,000 vehicles per day (VPD) in the Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) count.|$|E

40|$|The central <b>grassland</b> <b>region</b> {{occupies}} {{the center of}} North America in the United States, Canada and Mexico and is a unique resource for the continent. While {{there are no other}} areas with comparable features, the largest similar grassland areas occur in Europe and Asia. The uniqueness of the region derives from its size, its relative flatness, and the smoothness of its physical gradients. The smooth gradients in precipitation and temperature are the reasons why most gradients in ecosystem properties are also smooth. The west-east gradient in precipitation and the north-south gradient in temperature result in corresponding gradients in plant community types, net biomass production by plants, soil carbon storage, and nitrogen availability to plants. One of the most striking features of the present condition of the central <b>grassland</b> <b>region</b> is that a huge fraction of the original native grassland have been replaced by cropland...|$|E

40|$|Using {{radiosonde}} sounding {{data collected}} over an irri-gated area and over an adjacent natural <b>grassland</b> <b>region</b> in northeast Colorado, it is documented that larger available buoyant energy {{exists in the}} lower troposphere over the irri-gated land. This enhanced energy, a result of evapo-transpiration from the crops, is suggested as a mechanism forpotentially enhanced thunderstorm severity over and near irrigated locations. Low-level convergence that develops {{as a result of}} the differential turbulent sensible heating between the two land slllfaces can further enhance available buoyant energy. During recent years, there are anecdotal opinions that tor-nado frequency in the Colorado Front Range communities has increased significantly. While it is easy to dismiss thes...|$|E

40|$|In {{the prairie}} ecozone of Alberta and Saskatchewan, 356 species of spiders in 2 I {{families}} have been collected.
