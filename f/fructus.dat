2500|$|Lycium, {{the genus}} name, {{is derived from}} the ancient {{southern}} Anatolian region of Lycia (Λυκία). The fruit is known in pharmacological references as Lycii <b>fructus,</b> which is Latin for [...] "Lycium fruit".|$|E
2500|$|The species {{appears to}} have been seen and {{described}} – [...] "MARACANA Brasiliensibus, avis Psittaco planè similis (cuius & species) sed maior, plumae totius ex gryseo subcoerulescunt, clamat ut Psittacus. <b>Fructus</b> amat, Murucuia imprimis. [...] ("Brazilian parrot, bird very similar to Psittacus but larger, the entire plumage is ashy-bluish, calls like a parrot. Fruit it loves, especially Passionfruit.") – by the German naturalist Georg Marcgrave when he worked in Pernambuco in 1638.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] Centiloquium 'one hundred (sayings)' was {{the common}} Latin {{title of a}} [...] {{collection}} of 100 important astrological aphorisms. It was also known in Latin as Liber <b>Fructus</b> (Arabic: Kitab al-Tamara; Hebrew: Sefer ha-Peri) 'Book of the Fruit'. The latter reflected the belief that this offered a summation of Ptolemy's key astrological principles, and therefore presented [...] "The Fruit of his Four Books". It began, as all Ptolemy's works did, with a dedication to [...] "Syrus", which helped support the assumption of the work's Ptolemaic authenticity.|$|E
2500|$|An Egyptian Coptic ostracon {{that dates}} to {{around the year}} 600 bears the Greek words: [...] "Hail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, because thou didst {{conceive}} Christ, the Son of God, the Redeemer of our souls". This Eastern variant of the Ave Maria was apparently intended for liturgical use, just as the earliest form of the Hail Mary in the Western Church took {{the shape of an}} antiphon. However, {{there is little or no}} trace of the Hail Mary as an accepted [...] "devotional formula" [...] before about 1050. While two Anglo-Saxon manuscripts at the British Museum, one of which may be as old as the year 1030, show the words [...] "Ave Maria" [...] etc. and [...] "benedicta tu in mulieribus et benedictus <b>fructus</b> ventris tui" [...] it is not certain when these clauses were first joined to make one prayer The way that the rosary works is that your pray multiple of smaller prayers that became one huge prayer to worship and honor Jesus, Mary, and God.|$|E
2500|$|Synephrine, or, more specifically, p-synephrine, is an alkaloid, {{occurring}} {{naturally in}} some plants and animals, {{and also in}} approved drugs products as its m-substituted analog known as neo-synephrine. p-Synephrine (or formerly Sympatol and oxedrine [...] ) and m-synephrine {{are known for their}} longer acting adrenergic effects compared to norepinephrine. This substance is present at very low concentrations in common foodstuffs such as orange juice and other orange (Citrus species) products, both of the [...] "sweet" [...] and [...] "bitter" [...] variety. The preparations used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), also known as Zhi Shi, are the immature and dried whole oranges from Citrus aurantium (<b>Fructus</b> Aurantii Immaturus). Extracts of the same material or purified synephrine are also marketed in the US, sometimes in combination with caffeine, as a weight-loss-promoting dietary supplement for oral consumption. While the traditional preparations have been in use for millennia as a component of TCM-formulas, synephrine itself is not an approved OTC drug. As a pharmaceutical, m-synephrine is still used as a sympathomimetic (i.e. for its hypertensive and vasoconstrictor properties), mostly by injection for the treatment of emergencies such as shock, and rarely orally for the treatment of bronchial problems associated with asthma and hay-fever.|$|E
2500|$|During the 11th century, as {{the number}} of monasteries grew, so did Marian prayers. There is little or no trace of the Hail Mary as an {{accepted}} devotional formula before about 1050. All the evidence suggests that it took its rise from certain versicles and responsories occurring in the Little Office or Cursus of the Blessed Virgin which just at that time was coming into favour among the monastic orders. Two Anglo-Saxon manuscripts at the British Museum, one of which may be as old as the year 1030, show that the words [...] "Ave Maria" [...] etc. and [...] "benedicta tu in mulieribus et benedictus <b>fructus</b> ventris tui" [...] occurred in almost every part of the Cursus, and though {{it is not clear that}} these clauses were at first joined together so as to make one prayer, there is conclusive evidence that this had come to pass only a very little later. As regards the addition of the word [...] "Jesus," [...] it is commonly said that this was due to the initiative of Pope Urban IV (1261) although the evidence does not seem sufficiently clear to warrant positive statement on the point. This was the prayer as known to Thomas Aquinas when he gave a Lenten sermon on the [...] "Salutation of the Blessed Virgin" [...] in 1273. By the fourteenth century it was not uncommon to conclude with an appeal for sinners and especially for help at the hour of death. Official recognition of the Ave Maria in its complete form was finally given in the Roman Breviary of 1568.|$|E

6000|$|It was not right, somehow. What {{these words}} meant when {{translated}} {{was not the}} same as the pale rosary meant. There was a discrepancy, a falsehood. It irritated her to say, [...] "Dominus tecum," [...] or, [...] "benedicta tu in mulieribus." [...] She loved the mystic words, [...] "Ave Maria, Sancta Maria;" [...] she was moved by [...] "benedictus <b>fructus</b> ventris tui Jesus," [...] and by [...] "nunc et in hora mortis nostrae." [...] But none of it was quite real. It was not satisfactory, somehow.|$|E
6000|$|But Anna {{was only}} half safe within her mother's unthinking knowledge. She had a mother-of-pearl rosary that had been her own father's. What it meant to her she could never say. But the string of {{moonlight}} and silver, when she had it between her fingers, filled her with strange passion. She learned at school a little Latin, she learned an Ave Maria and a Pater Noster, she learned how to say her rosary. But that was no good.
