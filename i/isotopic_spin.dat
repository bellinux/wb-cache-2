40|$|An {{investigation}} of the rotational spectra of baryons and mesons is conducted. Diakonov, Petrov and Polyakov claimed that all light baryons are rotational excitations. A study {{of the history of}} particle physics indicates that the ideas of rotational spectra can be originally attributed to a constituent-quark (CQ) model as proposed by Mac Gregor. Later research advanced spin-orbit splitting in a deformed model as suggested by Bhaduri and others. In the present work, we show from current data that the rotational spectra of baryons and mesons are in agreement with the original claims of Mac Gregor: namely, the values for the rotational energies Erot of particles merge with those of nuclear rotational bands in light nuclei. It is also shown that particles of different <b>isotopic</b> <b>spins</b> are separated in mass by a 70 MeV quantum, which is related to the SU(3) decuplet mass spacing as originally proposed by Gell-Mann.

40|$|Some {{effects of}} the charge {{independence}} of nuclear forces on the emission and absorption of photons by light nuclei are investigated. It is found that the selection rules governing the change of <b>isotopic</b> <b>spin</b> T in such transitions are of practical importance in nuclei with T_z= 0, particularly the rule that E 1 transitions without change of <b>isotopic</b> <b>spin</b> are forbidden. Two examples of forbidden E 1 -emission (in N^(14) and O^(16)) are discussed, and detailed experimental reinvestigation is suggested in conection with each of them. The main consequence for photonuclear reactions of the aforementioned selection rule is that for each T_z= 0 nucleus there is a threshold for (allowed) E 1 absorption, corresponding to the first level with J= 1 −, T= 1. For (γ, α) - and (γ, d) -reactions, where no <b>isotopic</b> <b>spin</b> can be carried off by the particle, E 1 absorption can become effective only when there is enough energy to leave the residual nucleus in a T= 1 state. The roles of E 2 and M 1 absorption, with and without change of <b>isotopic</b> <b>spin,</b> are discussed, and appropriate sum rules are derived. The rules governing (γ, α) processes are applied particularly to reactions in C^(12) and O^(16), where considerable experimental evidence is available and appears to support the theoretical conclusions...|$|E
40|$|Bose-Einstein {{correlations}} of pions have been calculated {{in the presence}} of both statistical and coherent pion production with <b>isotopic</b> <b>spin</b> conservation taken into account. An additional contribution to pion correlation function has been found arising due to isospin effectBose-Einstein (BE) {{correlations of}} identical particles in multiple production processes are extensively studied last years because they give an information on the spacetime region of interaction [1, 2]. The basic effect is analogous to Hanbury Brown- Twiss (HBT) interferometry in optics [3] and suggests statistical production of the particles (mainly π mesons). The possible presence of coherent pionic component (for example, in the case of disoriented chiral condensate formation) modifies the HBT effect. This modification in particle physics was taken formerly in close analogy with optics [4]. On the other hand, the pions (contrary to photons) are subject to <b>isotopic</b> <b>spin</b> (and electric charge) conservation and so they can not be emitted independently.

40|$|Maleinimides {{are widely}} used to label {{proteins}} and to derivatize thiols. The so-called click reaction was shown to allow the efficient introduction of the maleinimido group into azido-modified fluorophores (benzoxazines) by reacting them with an alkyne-modified maleinimide to yield new thiol-reactive fluorescent labels 5 – 7. The reaction proceeds under mild experimental conditions and provides a new strategy with which to introduce the maleimide group, as exemplified here for fluorophores. Conceivably, it may be extended to radioactive, electro-active, <b>isotopic,</b> or <b>spin</b> labels. Previously reported methods {{for the formation of}} such maleinimides starting from open-ring precursors require rather harsh conditions. The new benzoxazines 5 – 7 are characterized by a fairly long and flexible linker between the chromophore and the maleinimide functional group, and their fluorescence can be photoexcited with diode lasers (which are preferred light sources in fluorometry). They were conjugated to: (a) the aminothiol cysteamine, (b) the peptide glutathione, and (c) to human serum albumin. The fluorescence of the phenoxazinone 5 is strongly solvatochromic, which suggests its use as a polarity-sensitive probe...|$|R

40|$|Pion-pion {{interaction}} is analyzed {{by using the}} dispersion relation for pion-nucleon scattering obtained by keeping the momentum transfer between an initial pion and a final nucleon constant. In order {{to take into account}} the singularity of two-pion threshold in the dispersion relation, the dispersion relation may be regarded as an integral equation for pion-nucleon scattering amplitude with the kernel of a pion-pion scattering amplitude. When this solution is compared with experiments on pion-nucleon scattering, it is found that the unknown quantity in the dispersion relation is only a pion-pion scattering amplitude. Therefore, if pion-pion amplitude is expressed in terms of an unknown parameter such as. scattering length, then this value can be determined via dispersion relation. Thus we are led to the following conclusion: In the <b>isotopic</b> <b>spin</b> state 1 = 0 (S-wave) of pion-pion system pion-pion {{interaction is}} attractive and the scattering length is of the order of one pion Compton wavelength, while in the <b>isotopic</b> <b>spin</b> state 1 = 1 (P-wave) of pion-pion state a definite conclusion could not be obtained.
