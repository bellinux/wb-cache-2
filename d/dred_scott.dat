5|$|Legally, {{scholars}} have compared Lone Wolf to the infamous <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> case, and universally condemned the decision.|$|E
5|$|African {{slaves were}} {{originally}} excluded from United States citizenship. In 1857, the United States Supreme Court held in <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> v. Sandford that slaves, former slaves, {{and their descendants}} were not eligible under the Constitution to be citizens. Additionally, American Indians were not originally recognized as citizens, since Indian tribes {{were considered to be}} outside the jurisdiction of the U.S. government.|$|E
5|$|The amendment's {{first section}} {{includes}} several clauses: the Citizenship Clause, Privileges or Immunities Clause, Due Process Clause, and Equal Protection Clause. The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition of citizenship, nullifying the Supreme Court's decision in <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> v. Sandford (1857), which had held that Americans descended from African slaves {{could not be}} citizens of the United States. The Privileges or Immunities Clause has been interpreted {{in such a way}} that it does very little.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, {{tensions}} {{were growing}} between the North and South over various issues including slavery. The Wilmot Proviso, introduced in 1846, contributed to these tensions; if passed, {{it would have}} banned slavery in any land acquired from Mexico. The Compromise of 1850 brought a temporary respite, but the <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> case, decided by the United States Supreme Court in 1857, spurred public debate. Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional and that African Americans had no standing as citizens under the constitution. Northerners were outraged and there was increasing talk in the South of secession from the Union.|$|E
5|$|The Citizenship Clause {{overruled}} the Supreme Court's <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> {{decision that}} black people were not citizens and could not become citizens, nor enjoy the benefits of citizenship. Some members of Congress voted for the Fourteenth Amendment in order to eliminate doubts about {{the constitutionality of the}} Civil Rights Act of 1866, or to ensure that no subsequent Congress could later repeal or alter the main provisions of that Act. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 had granted citizenship to all persons born in the United States if they were not subject to a foreign power, and this clause of the Fourteenth Amendment constitutionalized this rule.|$|E
5|$|In early 1859, {{abolitionist}} Republican U.S. Senator William H. Seward sold Tubman a {{small piece}} of land on the outskirts of Auburn, New York, for US$1,200. The city was a hotbed of antislavery activism, and Tubman seized the opportunity to deliver her parents from the harsh Canadian winters. Returning to the U.S. meant that escaped slaves were at risk of being returned to the south under the Fugitive Slave Law, and Tubman's siblings expressed reservations. Catherine Clinton suggests that anger over the 1857 <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> decision may have prompted Tubman to return to the U.S. Her land in Auburn became a haven for Tubman's family and friends. For years, she took in relatives and boarders, offering a safe place for black Americans seeking a better life in the north.|$|E
5|$|States sent Union regiments {{south in}} {{response}} to Lincoln's call to save the capital and confront the rebellion. On April 19, mobs in Baltimore, which controlled the rail links, attacked Union troops who were changing trains, and local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital. The Army responded by arresting local Maryland officials. Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach Washington. John Merryman, a Maryland official involved in hindering the U.S. troop movements, petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice and Marylander, Roger B. Taney, author of the controversial pro-slavery <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> opinion, to issue a writ of habeas corpus, and in June Taney, acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the Supreme Court, issued the writ, because in his opinion only Congress could suspend the writ. Lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the Ex parte Merryman ruling.|$|E
5|$|With its {{connection}} through the Ohio River to the east, the Mississippi {{to the south}} and north, and the Missouri to the west, St. Louis was ideally located to become the main base of interregional trade. In the 1840s, it became a destination for massive immigration by Irish and Germans. Some native-born Americans reacted with fear to the newcomers, adopting nativist sentiments. Missouri was a slave state, but the city's proximity to free states caused it to become a center for the filing of freedom suits. Many slaves gained freedom through such suits in the antebellum years. But, by the 1850s and the <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> case, interpretations had changed and the US Supreme Court ruled against him. It also ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional, contributing to the tensions causing the American Civil War. During the War, St. Louis had a small skirmish on its outskirts, but was held under Union control.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin {{worked to}} deny Douglas the 1860 Democratic presidential nomination, feeling {{he had turned}} against the South. Douglas contended that {{although}} the Supreme Court, in <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> v. Sandford, had stated Congress could not restrict slavery in the territories, the people of each territory could pass legislation to bar it. This position was anathema to the South. Benjamin praised Douglas's opponent in his re-election bid, former congressman Abraham Lincoln, for at least being true to his principles as an opponent of the expansion of slavery, whereas the senator considered Douglas to be a hypocrite. Benjamin was joined in his opposition to Douglas by Senator Davis; the two were so successful that the 1860 convention {{was not able to}} nominate anyone and split into Northern and Southern factions. The Northerners backed Douglas while Southern delegates chose Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky. Despite their agreement in opposing Douglas, Benjamin and Davis differed on some race issues: in May, Benjamin voted for a bill to aid Africans liberated by U.S. naval vessels from illegal slave ships, in order to return them to their native continent from Key West. Davis and many other Southerners opposed the bill.|$|E
5|$|The new senator {{took his}} seat when Congress convened in December 1857 (the term of his predecessor, James C. Jones, had expired in March). He came to Washington as usual without {{his wife and}} family; Eliza would visit Washington only once during Johnson's first time as senator, in 1860. Johnson {{immediately}} set about introducing the Homestead Bill in the Senate, but as most senators who supported it were Northern (many associated with the newly founded Republican Party), the matter became caught up in suspicions over the slavery issue. Southern senators felt that those who {{took advantage of the}} provisions of the Homestead Bill {{were more likely to be}} Northern non-slaveholders. The issue of slavery had been complicated by the Supreme Court's ruling earlier in the year in <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> v. Sandford that slavery could not be prohibited in the territories. Johnson, a slaveholding senator from a Southern state, made a major speech in the Senate the following May in an attempt to convince his colleagues that the Homestead Bill and slavery were not incompatible. Nevertheless, Southern opposition was key to defeating the legislation, 30–22. In 1859, it failed on a procedural vote when Vice President Breckinridge broke a tie against the bill, and in 1860, a watered-down version passed both houses, only to be vetoed by Buchanan at the urging of Southerners. Johnson continued his opposition to spending, chairing a committee to control it.|$|E
25|$|Douglas {{faced an}} ugly dilemma. If he {{rejected}} <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott,</b> {{he would lose}} Southern support he needed for the presidential election of 1860. If he embraced <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott,</b> he would lose northern support. He tried to avoid both hazards, issuing a tepid endorsement of the decision, while continuing to assert popular sovereignty without explicitly saying the Court was wrong.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, Moore {{called for}} impeaching judges who have issued rulings {{supportive}} of homosexuality and same-sex marriage. In November 2016, Moore {{argued that the}} Obergefell v. Hodges ruling which legalizedsame-sex marriage throughout the United States was worse than the 1857 <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> v. Sandford ruling which declared that African-Americans whether enslaved or free, were property {{and could not be}} American citizens. The <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> ruling is widely considered as the worst Supreme Court ruling.|$|E
25|$|Lincoln {{argued in}} his House Divided Speech that Douglas {{was part of}} a {{conspiracy}} to nationalize slavery. Lincoln said that ending the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery in Kansas and Nebraska was the first step in this direction, and that the <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> decision was another step in the direction of spreading slavery into Northern territories. Lincoln expressed the fear that the next <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> decision would make Illinois a slave state.|$|E
25|$|Including the Scypion family {{case and}} the <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> case, three hundred and one freedom suits were filed in St. Louis courts from 1814 to 1860. However, slaves gained freedom in {{less than half of}} them.|$|E
25|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that former Associate Justice Benjamin Robbins Curtis argued the case on behalf of Virginia before the Court. He lost. Curtis, as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, had dissented from the holding in <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> v. Sandford.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton Gamble was an American jurist and {{politician}} {{who served as}} the Chief Justice of the Missouri Supreme Court. He {{began his career as a}} prosecuting attorney for the Circuit Court of Howard County, Missouri until being appointed the Missouri Secretary of State. After a few years in St. Louis, Gamble opened a private legal practice that offered legal representation to slaves in court for both petitions for freedom and criminal proceedings. Though a slaveholder himself, he dissented in the Missouri Supreme Court decision of the <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> v. Emerson case. Gamble asserted that because <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> was held illegally as a slave while residing in a free state, he should be awarded his freedom.|$|E
25|$|Douglas {{initially}} {{endorsed the}} <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> decision of 1857. But during the 1858 Senate campaign, he argued its effect could be negated by popular sovereignty. He also opposed {{the efforts of}} President James Buchanan and his Southern allies to enact a Federal slave code and impose the Lecompton Constitution on Kansas.|$|E
25|$|A major Southern {{argument}} in the 1850s was that banning slavery in the territories discriminated against states that allowed slavery, making them second-class states. In 1857 the Supreme Court sided with the states' rights supporters, declaring in <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> v. Sandford that Congress had no authority to regulate slavery in the territories.|$|E
25|$|Criticisms of the {{doctrine}} continue as before. Critics argue judges are making determinations of policy and morality that properly belong with legislators ("legislating from the bench"), they are reading doctrines and principles into the Constitution that are not expressed in or implied by the document, or they are claiming power to expand the liberty of some people {{at the expense of}} other people's liberty (such as in <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> v. Sandford).|$|E
25|$|But, in 1857 the Supreme Court of the United States {{ruled in}} the <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> case that slaves had no {{standing}} as citizens to file freedom suits, {{and that the}} Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional, so the state's prohibition against slavery could not be enforced. More Southerners migrated to St. Cloud and Minnesota with slaves. After {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War, most Southerners returned to the South, taking their slaves with them.|$|E
25|$|Polk {{nominated}} both George W. Woodward of Pennsylvania and Levi Woodbury of New Hampshire in December 1845. Woodbury was confirmed, but Woodward {{was rejected}} by the Senate in 1846. Woodward's nomination was defeated in large part due to the opposition of Buchanan and Pennsylvania Senator Simon Cameron. Polk subsequently nominated Robert Cooper Grier of Pennsylvania, and Grier won confirmation. Woodbury died in 1851, but Grier served until 1870 and notably joined with the majority decision in <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> v. Sandford.|$|E
25|$|In 1846, {{the slaves}} <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> {{and his wife}} Harriet sued for freedom, in a case heard at the Old Courthouse, based on their having {{traveled}} and lived with their master in free states. Although the state ruled in his favor, {{an appeal to the}} U.S. Supreme Court resulted in an 1857 ruling against them. The Supreme Court ruled that slaves could not be counted as citizens. This decision overturned the basis of the Missouri Compromise. The year of the decision, both of the Scotts were emancipated by their master's family.|$|E
25|$|The Taney Court (1836–64) {{made several}} {{important}} rulings, such as Sheldon v. Sill, which held that while Congress may not limit the subjects the Supreme Court may hear, it may limit {{the jurisdiction of}} the lower federal courts to prevent them from hearing cases dealing with certain subjects. Nevertheless, it is primarily remembered for its ruling in <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> v. Sandford, which helped precipitate the Civil War. In the Reconstruction era, the Chase, Waite, and Fuller Courts (1864–1910) interpreted the new Civil War amendments to the Constitution and developed the doctrine of substantive due process (Lochner v. New York; Adair v. United States).|$|E
25|$|Slave rebellions, by Gabriel Prosser (1800), Denmark Vesey (1822), Nat Turner (1831), {{and most}} famously by John Brown (1859), caused {{fear in the}} white South, which imposed stricter {{oversight}} of slaves and reduced the rights of free blacks. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 required the states to cooperate with slave owners when attempting to recover escaped slaves, which outraged Northerners. Formerly, an escaped slave that reached a non-slave state was presumed to have attained sanctuary and freedom under the Missouri Compromise. The Supreme Court's 1857 decision in <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> v. Sandford ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional; angry Republicans said this decision threatened to make slavery a national institution.|$|E
25|$|Over the {{following}} decades, another central dispute over states' rights {{moved to the}} forefront. The issue of slavery polarized the union, with the Jeffersonian principles often being used by both sides—anti-slavery Northerners, and Southern slaveholders and secessionists—in debates that ultimately led to the American Civil War. Supporters of slavery often argued {{that one of the}} rights of the states was the protection of slave property wherever it went, a position endorsed by the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1857 <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> decision. In contrast, opponents of slavery argued that the non-slave-states' rights were violated both by that decision and by the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. Exactly which—and whose—states' rights were the casus belli in the Civil War remain in controversy.|$|E
25|$|The Compromise of 1850 {{allowed the}} territories of Utah and New Mexico {{to decide for}} or against slavery, but it also allowed the {{admission}} of California as a free state, reduced {{the size of the}} slave state of Texas by adjusting the boundary, and ended the slave trade (but not slavery itself) in the District of Columbia. In return, the South got a stronger fugitive slave law than the version mentioned in the Constitution. Whereas Douglas said that the Compromise of 1850 replaced the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery in the Louisiana Purchase territory north and west of the state of Missouri, Lincoln said that this was false, and that Popular Sovereignty and the <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> decision were a departure from the policies of the past that would nationalize slavery.|$|E
25|$|The Lecompton Constitution and <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> v. Sandford (sic)—Sanford: the defendant's {{name was}} misspelled in the reports— were both {{part of the}} Bleeding Kansas {{controversy}} over slavery {{as a result of}} the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which was Stephen Douglas' attempt at replacing the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery in the Kansas and Nebraska territories with popular sovereignty, which meant that the people of a territory could vote either for or against slavery. The Lecompton Constitution, which would have allowed slavery in Kansas, was the result of massive vote fraud by the pro-slavery Border Ruffians. Douglas defeated the Lecompton Constitution because it was supported by the minority of pro-slavery people in Kansas, and Douglas believed in majority rule. Douglas hoped that both South and North would support popular sovereignty, but the opposite was true. Neither side trusted Douglas.|$|E
25|$|At {{the debate}} at Freeport Lincoln forced Douglas {{to choose between}} two options, either of which would damage Douglas' {{popularity}} and chances of getting reelected. Lincoln asked Douglas to reconcile popular sovereignty with the Supreme Court's <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> decision. Douglas responded {{that the people of}} a territory could keep slavery out even though the Supreme Court said that the federal government had no authority to exclude slavery, simply by refusing to pass a slave code and other legislation needed to protect slavery. Douglas alienated Southerners with this Freeport Doctrine, which damaged his chances of winning the Presidency in 1860. As a result, Southern politicians would use their demand for a slave code for territories such as Kansas to drive a wedge between the Northern and Southern wings of the Democratic Party. In splitting what was the majority political party in 1858 (the Democratic Party), Southerners guaranteed the election of Lincoln, the nominee of the newly formed Republican Party, in 1860.|$|E
25|$|The Blair, Lee, and Jalloh and Barrie families, three {{politically}} active {{families of the}} time, are irrefutably tied to Silver Spring's history. In 1840, Francis Preston Blair, who later helped organize the modern American Republican Party, along with his daughter, Elizabeth, discovered a spring flowing with chips of mica (the now-dry spring is still visible at Acorn Park). Two years later, he completed a twenty-room mansion he dubbed Silver Spring on a 250-acre (one-square-kilometer) country homestead situated just outside Washington, D.C. (The house stood until 1954.) By 1854, Blair's son, Montgomery Blair, who became Postmaster General under Abraham Lincoln and represented <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> before the United States Supreme Court, built the Falkland house in the area. By {{the end of the}} decade, Elizabeth Blair married Samuel Phillips Lee, third cousin of future Confederate leader Robert E. Lee, and gave birth to a boy, Francis Preston Blair Lee. The child would eventually become the first popularly elected Senator in United States history.|$|E
25|$|In 1803, the Supreme Court {{established}} {{judicial review}} of federal legislation in Marbury v. Madison, holding, however, that Congress could not grant unconstitutional power to the Court itself. The Constitution does not explicitly state that the courts may exercise judicial review; however, the notion that courts could declare laws unconstitutional was envisioned by the founding fathers. Alexander Hamilton, for example, mentioned and expounded upon the doctrine in Federalist No. 78. Originalists on the Supreme Court have argued that if the constitution does not say something explicitly it is unconstitutional to infer what it should, might or could have said. Judicial review means that the Supreme Court can nullify a congressional law. It is a huge check by the courts on the legislative authority and limits congressional power substantially. In 1857, for example, the Supreme Court struck down provisions of a congressional act of 1820 in its <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> decision. At the same time, the Supreme Court can extend congressional power through its constitutional interpretations.|$|E
25|$|The Episcopal Church {{can trace}} its {{beginnings}} in Scott County to services held in 1837 by the Rt. Rev. Philander Chase, Bishop of Illinois. The services {{were held in}} the hotel at Rockingham, which is now the southwest section of Davenport. In 1841 the Rev. Zachariah Goldsmith of Virginia was appointed missionary to Davenport by the Domestic Committee of the Board of Missions of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States. On October 14, 1841, Trinity Church was organized in Davenport. The congregation originally worshiped {{in the home of}} Dr. John Emerson on Second Street. He had owned the slave <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott,</b> who lived with him in Davenport when it was still a part of the Wisconsin Territory. A small frame church was built on the corner of Fourth and Main Streets. In 1853 the congregation erected a stone building at the corner of Fifth and Rock Island (now Pershing) Streets. The building was built in the Gothic style and included a rose window. It is the first church in Iowa to have a pipe organ.|$|E
25|$|The Lincoln-Douglas Debates were {{a series}} of seven debates in 1858 between Stephen Douglas, United States Senator from Illinois, and Abraham Lincoln, the Republican who sought to replace Douglas in the Senate. The debates were mainly about slavery. Douglas defended his Kansas–Nebraska Act, which {{replaced}} the Missouri Compromise ban on slavery in the Louisiana Purchase territory north and west of Missouri with popular sovereignty, which allowed residents of territories such as the Kansas to vote either for or against slavery. Douglas put Lincoln on the defensive by accusing him of being a Black Republican abolitionist, but Lincoln responded by asking Douglas to reconcile popular sovereignty with the <b>Dred</b> <b>Scott</b> decision. Douglas' Freeport Doctrine was that residents of a territory could keep slavery out by refusing to pass a slave code and other laws needed to protect slavery. Douglas' Freeport Doctrine, {{and the fact that}} he helped defeat the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution, made Douglas unpopular in the South, which led to the 1860 split of the Democratic Party into Northern and Southern wings. The Democrats retained control of the Illinois legislature, and Douglas thus retained his seat in the U.S. Senate (at that time United States Senators were elected by the state legislatures, not by popular vote); however, Lincoln's national profile was greatly raised, paving the way for his election as president of the United States two years later.|$|E
