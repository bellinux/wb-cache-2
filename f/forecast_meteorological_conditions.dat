40|$|International audienceIn {{the frame}} of the WMO Global Atmosphere Watch Urban Research Meteorology and Environment {{programme}} (GURME), a system for forecasting air pollution episode potential in the Canary Islands has been developed. Meteorological parameters relevant to air quality (synoptic wind speed, wind direction, boundary layer height and temperature at 91 vertical levels) are obtained from the European Centre for Medium range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) once a day for up to four days ahead. In addition, a model based on the analogue method utilising six years of historical meteorological and air quality data predicts the probability of SO 2 concentration exceeding certain thresholds for a measurement station located in Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Meteorological forecasts are also provided from a high resolution (2 km) local area model (MM 5) implemented for the Canary Islands domain.

40|$|Solid-fuel rocket motors {{used by the}} United States Air Force (USAF) {{to launch}} {{missiles}} and spacecraft can produce ambient-air concentrations of hydrogen chloride (HCI) gas. The HCI gas is a reaction product exhausted from the rocket motor during normal launch or emitted {{as a result of}} a catastrophic abort destroying the launch vehicle. Depending on the concentration in ambient air, the HCI gas can be irritating or toxic to humans. The diagnostic and complex-terrain wind field and particle dispersion model used by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory`s (LLNL`s) Atmospheric Release Advisory Capability (ARAC) Program was applied to the launch of a Peacekeeper missile from Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) in California. Results from this deterministic model revealed that under specific <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions,</b> cloud passage from normal-launch and catastropic-abort situations can yield measureable ground-level air concentrations of HCI where the general public is located. To protect public health in the event of such cloud passage, scientifically defensible, emergency ambient-air concentration limits for HCI were developed and recommended to the USAF for use as launch-hold criteria. Such launch-hold criteria are used to postpone a launch unless the <b>forecasted</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> favor the prediction of safe ground-level concentrations of HCl for the general public. The recommended concentration limits are a 2 ppM 1 -h time-weighted average (TWA) concentration constrained by a 1 -min 10 -ppM average concentration. This recommended criteria is supported by human dose-response information, including data for sensitive humans (e. g., asthmatics), and the dose response exhibited experimentally by animal models with respiratory physiology or responses considered similar to humans...|$|R
40|$|The Glory Trip (GT) 17 -PA Peacekeeper launch {{originally}} scheduled at Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) between 15 and 20 November 1994 was cancelled {{based on}} modeled toxic exhaust cloud calculations. The Missile Flight Control Branch, 30 th Space Wing Safety Office (30 SW/SEY), made several successive ``No Go`` decisions using Version 7. 05 Rocket Exhaust Effluent Dispersion Model (REEDM) with <b>forecasted</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions.</b> REEDM runs made from T- 14 hours to T- 30 minutes predicted that ground-level concentrations of hydrogen chloride (HCl) {{gas from the}} catastrophic abort case would exceed 5 ppM, the ``instantaneous`` ambient air concentration ``Tier 2 `` limit at that time, modeled as a peak 1 -minute cloud centerline concentration. Depending on the forecasted wind direction and speed at launch time, this limit was predicted to be exceeded sometimes at Base Housing, approximately 10 km southeast of the launch, and during other launch windows at the town of Casmalia, about 5 km east- southeast. In late December 1994, the LLNL Atmospheric Release Advisory Capability (ARAC) program modeled the aborted November 1994 Peacekeeper launch and compared its results with REEDM. This initial comparison showed that the ARAC model predicted values about 1 / 3 as large as REEDM for the limiting case at Base Housing. Subsequently ARAC was asked to provide real-time modeling support to 30 SW/SEY during the rescheduled Peacekeeper GT 17 -PA launch in January 1995 and two Minuteman launches in February and March.

40|$|AbstractDue to the high-uncertainty and high-dynamics {{of climate}} and weather changes, the {{monitoring}} and <b>forecasting</b> of <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> {{have been a}} challenging task, especially for the southern hemisphere and polar areas where ground-based data are very sparse and only limited meteorological information is available.

It is critical to analyse the error characteristics of GNSS RO retrievals as a fundamental step for this new research initiative. COSMIC atmospheric products are evaluated extensively by using radiosonde records from 35 Australian and Antarctic weather stations {{for a period of}} thirteen months (between July 2006 and July 2007).

40|$|International audienceThe {{operational}} numerical {{weather prediction}} model Lokalmodell LM with 7 km horizontal resolution was evaluated for <b>forecasting</b> <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> during observed urban air pollution episodes. The resolution was increased to experimental 2. 8 km and 1. 1 km resolution by one-way interactive nesting without introducing urbanisation of physiographic parameters or parameterisations. The episodes examined are two severe winter inversion-induced episodes in Helsinki in December 1995 and Oslo in January 2003, three suspended dust episodes in spring and autumn in Helsinki and Oslo, and a late-summer photochemical episode in the Valencia area. The evaluation was basically performed against observations and radiosoundings {{and focused on the}} LM skill at <b>forecasting</b> the key <b>meteorological</b> parameters characteristic for the specific episodes. These included temperature inversions, atmospheric stability and low wind speeds for the Scandinavian episodes and the development of mesoscale recirculations in the Valencia area. LM forecasts often improved due to higher model resolution especially in mountainous areas like Oslo and Valencia where features depending on topography like temperature, wind fields and mesoscale valley circulations were better described. At coastal stations especially in Helsinki, forecast gains were due to the improved physiographic parameters (land fraction, soil type, or roughness length). The Helsinki and Oslo winter inversions with extreme nocturnal inversion strengths of 18 °C were not sufficiently predicted with all LM resolutions. In Helsinki, overprediction of surface temperatures and low-level wind speeds basically led to underpredicted inversion strength. In the Oslo episode, the situation was more complex involving erroneous temperature advection and mountain-induced effects for the higher resolutions. Possible explanations include the influence of the LM treatment of snow cover, sea ice and stability-dependence of transfer and diffusion coefficients. The LM simulations distinctly improved for winter daytime and nocturnal spring and autumn inversions and showed good skill at <b>forecasting</b> further episode-relevant <b>meteorological</b> parameters. The evaluation of the photochemical Valencia episode concentrated on the dominating mesoscale circulation patterns and showed that the LM succeeds well in describing all the qualitative features observed in the region. LM performance in forecasting the examined episodes thus depends on the key episode characteristics and also the season of the year with a need to improve model performance in very stable inversion conditions not only for urban simulations...|$|R

40|$|Coal mining {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{industries}} in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. From an environmental perspective, dust and the contribution from mining is a key topic of discussion by industry, regulators and the community. While measured dust levels are influenced by many sources, the local mining industry generally aims to manage site emissions as far as is reasonably practicable. To assist with the management of dust emissions from coal mines in the Hunter Valley, the Australian Coal Association Research Program funded a project (C 19034) to develop an emission estimation and air dispersion modelling system. This paper describes the system and its key outcomes. The main objective of the system is to issue dust and <b>meteorological</b> <b>forecasts</b> so that operations can plan for and implement suitable emission reduction measures in advance of potentially adverse conditions. The system makes use of the CSIRO’s computer-based air dispersion model known as TAPM (The Air Pollution Model). This model is provided with estimates of mine site dust emissions and <b>forecasts</b> of <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> to predict ambient dust concentrations in the Hunter Valley, for up to two days in advance. Dust concentrations are represented as an air quality index, consistent with the approach adopted by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage. Forecasts are delivered via a daily email and detailed system outputs are uploaded to a dedicated web-site that can be accessed at any time by relevant stakeholders. Interest in the system has grown since its development and the main factor for the take up appears to be the simplistic nature of the outputs.

40|$|Blowing and {{drifting}} of snow is a {{major concern}} for transportation efficiency and road safety in regions where their development is common. One common way to mitigate snow drift on roadways is to install plastic snow fences. Correct design of snow fences is critical for road safety and maintaining the roads open during winter in the US Midwest and other states affected by large snow events during the winter season and to maintain costs related to accumulation of snow on the roads and repair of roads to minimum levels. Of critical importance for road safety is the protection against snow drifting in regions with narrow rights of way, where standard fences cannot be deployed at the recommended distance from the road. Designing snow fences requires sound engineering judgment and a thorough evaluation of the potential for snow blowing and drifting at the construction site. The evaluation includes site-specific design parameters typically obtained with semi-empirical relations characterizing the local transport conditions. Among the critical parameters involved in fence design and assessment of their post-construction efficiency is the quantification of the snow accumulation at fence sites. The present study proposes a joint experimental and numerical approach to monitor snow deposits around snow fences, quantitatively estimate snow deposits in the field, asses the efficiency and improve the design of snow fences. Snow deposit profiles were mapped using GPS based real-time kinematic surveys (RTK) conducted at the monitored field site during and after snow storms. The monitored site allowed testing different snow fence designs under close to identical conditions over four winter seasons. The study also discusses the detailed monitoring system and analysis of weather <b>forecast</b> and <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> at the monitored sites.

Atmospheric particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter [*]≤[*] 2. 5  µm (PM 2. 5) samples were collected and gaseous pollutants (SO 2, NO, NO x, and O 3) were measured online at a site in Peking University (PKU). To determine the influence of <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> on the levels of air pollution, we first compared the air pollutant concentrations during days with stable <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, there were few days with stable <b>meteorological</b> <b>conditions</b> during the Victory Parade.
