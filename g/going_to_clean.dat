2500|$|In November 2008 Benjamin Emanuel, {{the father}} of U.S. {{president}} Barack Obama's new Chief of Staff appointee Rahm Emanuel was quoted by a Hebrew language daily as saying, [...] "Obviously, he will influence the President to be pro-Israel. Why shouldn't he do it? What is he, an Arab? He's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> {{the floor of the}} White House." [...] ADC called on Rahm Emanuel to repudiate his father's comment, saying it viewed [...] "this characterization of an Arab as an unacceptable smear." [...] On November 13, 2008 Rahm Emanuel issued a statement doing so. An Emanuel spokesman said Emanuel offered to meet with Arab-American community representatives in the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, {{he criticized}} the militant Trotskyist and {{historian}} Jean-Jacques Marie for {{the contents of}} chapter entitled: [...] "1922: the year of serenity", published in his biography Lenin, 1870-1924 (Balland, Paris, 2004). Courtois accuses Jean-Jacques Marie for apologising for Lenin for whom 1922, on the contrary, was [...] "the year of transition to paranoia". This showed itself on the one hand, by the note from Lenin to the Politburo on 19 March 1922 in which he {{wanted to use the}} Soviet famine of 1921–1922 to destroy the Orthodox Church: [...] "It is precisely now when the famine-struck regions eat human flesh, and thousands of corpses litter the roads, that we need to enforce the confiscation of church property with savage energy and most unforgivingly, and crush any hint of resistance, with such brutality that it will be talked about for decades". This [...] "paranoia" [...] is also reflected in the Terror against the Socialist-Revolutionaries (death sentences, gulag, etc..) as well as the expulsion (or sometimes internal exile) of the Russian intelligentsia. This last event is described by him in the chapter, [...] "Lenin and the destruction of the Russian intelligentsia", in his book Communism and totalitarianism (pre-published in Societal magazine No. 55 to 59): [...] "the deportees were warned that any illegal return to Russia would automatically entail the death penalty". On 25 May 1922, Lenin addressed himself to Stalin in the following terms: [...] "hundreds of these gentlemen must be expelled without mercy. We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> up Russia once and for all.... They should all be turned away from Russia". In September 1922, Lenin justified his act to Maxim Gorky: [...] "the intellectuals, the lackeys of capitalism, think they are the brains of the nation. In reality, they are not the brain, they are crap".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{believed}} {{the version of}} the incident as told by the four men – that they were merely panhandling with neither intimidation nor threats of violence. This view was later discredited when Cabey admitted in a newspaper interview that his friends had indeed intended to rob Goetz, who looked like [...] "easy bait". Some saw the incident as racial (with Goetz being white and the four young men black), and the jury verdict as a blow to race relations. Benjamin Hooks, director of the NAACP, said [...] "The jury verdict was inexcusable. [...] It was proven – according to his own statements – that Goetz did the shooting and went far {{beyond the realm of}} self-defense. There was no provocation for what he did." [...] Representative Floyd Flake agreed, saying, [...] "I think that if a black had shot four whites, the cry for the death penalty would have been almost automatic." [...] Co-counsel for Cabey C. Vernon Mason, a candidate for district attorney who was later disbarred, said Goetz's actions were racist, as did the Rev. Al Sharpton. Organized demonstrators accused Goetz of genocide. Goetz's racial language about criminal activity on 14th Street, allegedly made at a community meeting 18 months before the shooting – [...] "The only way we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> up this street is {{to get rid of the}} spics and niggers" [...] – was offered as evidence of racial motivation for the shooting. Black political and religious leaders twice called for Federal civil rights investigations. An investigation by the office of U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani determined that the impetus for the shooting had been fear, not race. In an interview with Stone Phillips of Dateline NBC, Goetz later admitted that his fear was enhanced due to the fact that the alleged muggers were black.|$|E

This <b>going</b> home <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> himself {{is one of the}} man’s incomprehensible compromises with inexorable facts; he, and his hat, and his boots, and his clothes, never showing any trace of cleaning, but being uniformly in one {{condition}} of dust and grit.|$|R

6000|$|I {{have never}} held a whole-hearted brief for the British character. There {{is a lot}} of good in it, but much which is repellent. It has a kind of {{deliberate}} unattractiveness, setting out on its journey with the words: [...] "Take me or leave me." [...] One may respect a person of this sort, but it is difficult either to know or to like him. I am told that an American officer said recently to a British staff officer in a friendly voice: [...] "So we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> up Brother Boche together!"

Nobody ever saw or heard anything quite like Norman Douglas these days, believe ME. He's so tickled that he's going to marry Ellen West after wanting her all his life. If I was Ellen--but then, I'm not, and if she is satisfied I can very well be. I heard her say years ago when she was a schoolgirl that she didn't want a tame puppy for a husband.

50|$|Rondalee {{steps up}} for the White Team, taking on two NFLers: Scott for the Red Team and Damien for the Blue Team. The Blue Team is down to only two players - Damien and Lori - so the stakes are {{especially}} high. The Red Team hasn't won a challenge all season {{and they are very}} sick of losing. Rondalee is the first to fall in, leaving the quarterback and the lineman to face off. It's a tough battle, but in the end Damien drops, which means Scott nabs the Red Team's first victory! Now it's time to assign the penalties. One team will be on cleaning duty - they have <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> the whole house and can't hit the gym until their chores are done. The other team will be leaving the ranch and won't be back until the weigh-in. They won't have their trainer or access to the gym. Instead, they'll be headed to the polar opposite of the ranch: Las Vegas. The Red Team decides to send the White Team to Vegas, seeing as they've been the dominant team all season.

50|$|Characteristically of the series, the angel-hearted Kitano would {{misunderstand}} {{the actions}} of the people he faces (or forced to face), never even thinking ill of them, while the reverse is almost certainly true. This is the running gag that serves as the centre of which the story revolve around. For example, in chapter 14, when Kuroda asked Kitano and Takehisa to help him “clean up the trash” in Soukyuu Park near the school, Kitano told them, “If you’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>clean</b> up trash, you use brooms, isn’t that right?” Kuroda and Takehisa thought the brooms will be used as weapons to “clean up the trash” (beating up the delinquents from the other schools in Soukyuu Park), while Kitano literally meant for cleaning up the park (picking up and throwing away used soda cans and food into the trash).|$|E
