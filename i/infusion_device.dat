40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract In {{a context of}} day hospital care of cancer patients, a protocol combining etoposide and carboplatin is used in paediatrics. Disposable <b>infusion</b> <b>devices</b> {{can be used to}} improve patient quality of life and to optimize nursing time. Stability data are available for carboplatin in these devices but not for etoposide. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the stability of etoposide solutions in these devices by monitoring the changing etoposide con-centration. To study the changing etoposide concentration, we investigated three different concentrations, each in two different solvents: sodium chloride (NaCl) 0. 9 % and dextrose 5 %, in Intermate disposable <b>infusion</b> <b>devices.</b> Quantitative analyses were performed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet (UV) detection on samples collected over a 24 -h study period. The results showed that 100 mg/L etoposide solutions were stable for 24 h in NaCl 0. 9 % and for 12 h in dextrose 5 %, whatever the temperature. The 400 -mg/L solutions were stable for 24 h in both diluents, whatever the temperature, whereas the 600 -mg/L solutions when diluted in NaCl 0. 9 % and dextrose 5 % in water were stable for 8 and 6 h, respectively. We found that precipitation was the main phenomenon responsible for decreased etoposide concen-trations. This study allowed us to conclude that etoposide solutions prepared in Intermate <b>infusion</b> <b>devices</b> are stable for day hospital administration in paediatrics. It will also allow us to conduct a future clinical study that will focus on the medico-economic feasibility of this protocol and on the evaluation of patient and nurse satisfaction. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} {{compliance}} of disposable {{elements such as}} infusion lines and syringes can significantly affect the performance characteristics of <b>infusion</b> <b>devices.</b> In a technique {{used to determine the}} compliance of infusion lines, the item under test is placed in a semi sealed water filled enclosure and the volume of fluid displaced is measured on an analytical weighing balance as set pressures are applied to the test item. Thermal drift of the measurement chamber was minimised by inclusion of discs of Invar alloy. Measurements were also made to determine the compliance of syringes used with syringe drivers where the volume of fluid displaced upon release of established pressure levels within a syringe was measured using a separate measurement configuration using again an analytical weighing balance. These techniques were used to determine the relative contributions to compliance of infusion lines and syringes to the dynamics of operation of syringe drivers. This indicated that contributions to compliance from syringes were significantly greater than that of connected infusion lines. Values of time to occlude, occlusion bolus and effects of height elevation for <b>infusion</b> <b>devices</b> with elements of varying compliance and line configuration are discussed. ...|$|R
