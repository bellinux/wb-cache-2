This is contrasted to a possible alternative policy of English and their native language, and that the emphasis on Mandarin threatens family ties, as older generations are often not conversant in Mandarin (unless it is their native tongue). Some critics include that the Mandarin education system's goal of promoting cultural identity has left many younger generations of Mandarin speakers unable to communicate with their non-Mandarin Chinese language-speaking grandparents.|$|E

2500|$|Juma and the Magic Jinn is a children's {{picture book}} written by Joy Anderson and {{illustrated}} by Charles Mikolaycak. First published in 1986, this folktale with an African setting {{tells the story of}} a fictional, daydreaming boy named Juma who is living on the real Lamu Island just off the East coast of Kenya. Desiring to be some place where he won't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> or behave, Juma seeks the help of a magical jinn (in English, a genie), a decision which leads Juma on misadventures. In the same year the book was published, Juma and the Magic Jinn won a 1986 Golden Kite Award for Mikolaycak's illustrations. These illustrations additionally played a role in Mikolaycak receiving the 1987 Kerland Award [...] "in recognition of singular attainments in the creation of children's literature." ...|$|E

2500|$|At home, Juma disobeys his mother's prior {{instructions}} and removes the cork sealing the jinn jar and calls the jinn. Juma is sceptical about his efforts {{and does not}} believe in magic. However, the magic jinn appears, in this instance as a [...] "young woman with black and smiling catlike eyes," [...] whose dark hair is tied with amber beads. The jinn offers to grant Juma wishes. Desiring to be some place where he won't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> or behave, Juma formulates his wishes to overcome his need for schooling, particularly math and writing ("sums and script"). The magic jinn grants some of Juma's wishes and is sent away from his home on what turns out to be misadventures. Eventually, Juma is able to get home again but arrives with new appreciation of his home and family and realisation that learning can be exciting and fun.|$|E
2500|$|In Du [...] "Cubisme" [...] Gleizes and Metzinger wrote: [...] "If we {{wished to}} relate {{the space of the}} [...] {{painters}} to geometry, we should have to refer it to the non-Euclidean mathematicians; we should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>study,</b> at some length, certain of Riemann's theorems." [...] Cubism itself, then, was not based on any geometrical theory, but corresponded better to non-Euclidean geometry than classical or Euclidean geometry. The essential was in the understanding of space other than by the classical method of perspective; an understanding that would include and integrate the fourth dimension. Cubism, with its new geometry, its dynamism and multiple view-point perspective, not only represented a departure from Euclid's model, but it achieved, according to Gleizes and Metzinger, a better representation of the real world: one that was mobile and changing in time. For Gleizes, Cubism represented a [...] "normal evolution of an art that was mobile like life itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Husk {{has been}} able to shift into {{anything}} that does not exceed her body mass. Any extra mass left when she shifts into a smaller form such as an insect or a bird is shunted into an unknown extra-dimensional space, and will return to Husk when she resumes her human form. However, she has also demonstrated an ability to take on extra mass and become heavier. [...] She has the capability to blend in with surroundings, but in order to do so, she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> the texture she seeks to mimic first. [...] She can husk away minor injuries, but deeper ones will stay with her. She can hold a form for about an hour before she needs to revert to her original form. She can morph repeatedly. She is not required to stay in any one form, but too many transformations can become very painful. In great stress or trauma, Paige can shed without control, revealing patchwork forms. When Paige 'husks', she sheds her clothing as well, this has the side effect of leaving her nude when she returns to her normal form.|$|E

2500|$|Stephanie Maslansky {{returned}} as the costume designer for Jessica Jones from Daredevil, and was assisted {{on the first}} episode by Jenn Rogien, who crafted Jessica Jones' costume of leather jacket, faded jeans, and boots. Maslansky's fashion choices for each character were influenced by their comic incarnations, with her saying, [...] "You really <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> your history of the original characters {{and see how they}} dress, how they were originally drawn, how they evolved through the years in these comics. And what you might discover is that, as illustrated, they kind of do wear the same thing all the time." [...] Maslansky also stated that [...] "everyone has a very specific look, and you can vary within that look, but it’s not over the top. It has to feel realistic and feel very grounded in this authentic reality we’ve created in Hell’s Kitchen." [...] On Jones' costume, Maslansky said she [...] "considers her clothing to be an armor and a shield and something that helps her maintain a distance from other people and privacy. It keeps her from having to deal with the rest of humanity in a certain sort of way." [...] At least 10 versions of Jones' jacket were made, which started as an Acne Studios leather motorcycle jacket that had any [...] "bells and whistles and any additional superfluous design details" [...] removed, while 20 pairs of jeans were used, with both being aged and distressed.|$|E
