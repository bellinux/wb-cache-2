5|$|Red foxes are {{the most}} {{important}} rabies vector in Europe. In London, arthritis is not uncommon in foxes, being particularly frequent in the spine. Foxes may be infected with leptospirosis and tularemia, though they are not overly susceptible to the latter. They may also fall ill from listeriosis and spirochetosis, as well as acting as vectors in spreading erysipelas, brucellosis and tick-born encephalitis. A mysterious fatal disease near Lake Sartlan in the Novosibirsk Oblast was noted among local red foxes, but the cause was undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of <b>encephalomyelitis,</b> which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes. Individual cases of foxes infected with Yersinia pestis are known.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of oligoclonal bands {{in the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination <b>encephalomyelitis,</b> and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.|$|E

25|$|When {{the patient}} suffers {{more than one}} demyelinating episode of ADEM, the disease is then called {{recurrent}} disseminated <b>encephalomyelitis</b> or multiphasic disseminated <b>encephalomyelitis</b> (MDEM). Also, a fulminant course in adults has been described.|$|E
25|$|Acute disseminated <b>encephalomyelitis</b> (ADEM), or acute demyelinating <b>encephalomyelitis,</b> {{is a rare}} {{autoimmune}} disease marked by a sudden, widespread attack of inflammation {{in the brain and}} spinal cord. As well as causing the brain and spinal cord to become inflamed, ADEM also attacks the nerves of the central nervous system and damages their myelin insulation, which, as a result, destroys the white matter. It is often triggered after the patient has received a viral infection or, perhaps exceedingly rarely specific non-routine vaccinations.|$|E
25|$|D-ribose is {{commonly}} indicated for {{congestive heart failure}} (as well as other forms of heart disease) and for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also called myalgic <b>encephalomyelitis</b> (ME).|$|E
25|$|The scleroses {{that define}} the disease are the {{remainders}} of previous demyelinating lesions in the CNS white matter of a patient (<b>encephalomyelitis)</b> showing special characteristics, like for example confluent instead of perivenous demyelination.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{allergic}} <b>encephalomyelitis</b> (EAE) is {{an animal}} model of CNS inflammation and demyelination frequently used to investigate potential MS treatments. An acute monophasic illness, EAE {{is far more}} similar to ADEM than MS.|$|E
25|$|From 1985 to 1992, Rutter {{suffered}} severely from myalgic <b>encephalomyelitis</b> (ME, {{or chronic}} fatigue syndrome), which restricted his output; after 1985 he stopped writing music on commission, {{as he was}} unable to guarantee meeting deadlines.|$|E
25|$|In Britain, the 1950s saw the weaponization of plague, brucellosis, {{tularemia}} {{and later}} equine <b>encephalomyelitis</b> and vaccinia viruses, but the programme was unilaterally cancelled in 1956. The United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories weaponized anthrax, tularemia, brucellosis, Q-fever and others.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{instances}} of optic neuritis and myelitis were reported, and many believed it constituted a distinct clinical entity. However, some patients had pathology {{in other parts}} of the brain, a feature which was more suggestive of acute disseminated <b>encephalomyelitis</b> or MS.|$|E
25|$|Chronic fatigue {{syndrome}} (CFS), {{also referred to}} as myalgic <b>encephalomyelitis</b> (ME), is a medical condition characterized by long-term fatigue and other symptoms that limit a person's ability to carry out ordinary daily activities. Quality of life of persons with CFS can be compromised.|$|E
25|$|For some {{investigation}} teams {{this means that}} MS is an immunopathogenetically heterogeneous disease. The latter hypothesis is further corroborated by a recent study that demonstrated significant differences in routine cerebrospinal fluid findings between patients with pattern I lesions and patients with non-pattern I lesions, including a lack of CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands, in most pattern II and III patients. Finally, some previously diagnosed with pattern II MS were later found to have in fact MOG-IgG-related <b>encephalomyelitis,</b> suggesting that both the current clinicoradiological diagnostic criteria for MS and the histopathological criteria for MS may be insufficiently specific. This was already indicated by previous studies that found a relatively high rate of false diagnoses of MS among patients with AQP4-IgG-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders or MOG <b>encephalomyelitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{variant of}} ADEM in adults has been described, {{also related to}} anti-MOG auto-antibodies, has been named fulminant disseminated <b>encephalomyelitis,</b> {{and it has been}} {{reported}} to be clinically ADEM, but showing MS-like lesions on autopsy. It has been classified inside the anti-MOG associated inflammatory demyelinating diseases.|$|E
25|$|A {{direction}} {{of research is}} towards {{the use of drugs}} that target remyelinating inhibitor proteins, or other inhibitors. Possible strategies include vaccination against these proteins (active immunisation), or treatment with previously created antibodies (passive immunisation). These strategies appear promising on animal models with experimental autoimmune <b>encephalomyelitis</b> (EAE), a model of MS.|$|E
25|$|Regional {{variations}} in disease presentation are seen: parotid abscesses characteristically occur in Thai children, but this presentation {{has been described}} only once in Australia. Conversely, prostatic abscesses are found in up to 20% of Australian males, but are rarely described elsewhere. An <b>encephalomyelitis</b> syndrome is recognised in northern Australia.|$|E
25|$|NOGO –The protein family Nogo, {{particularly}} Nogo-A, {{has been}} identified as an inhibitor of remyelination in the CNS, especially in autoimmune mediated demyelination, such as found in Experimental Autoimmune <b>Encephalomyelitis</b> (EAE) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Nogo A functions via either its amino-Nogo terminus through an unknown receptor, or by its Nogo-66 terminus through NgR1, p75, TROY or LINGO1. Antagonising this inhibitor results in improved remyelination, as it is involved in the RhoA pathway.|$|E
25|$|Chronic <b>encephalomyelitis,</b> {{which may}} be progressive, can involve {{cognitive}} impairment, brain fog, migraines, balance issues, weakness in the legs, awkward gait, facial palsy, bladder problems, vertigo, and back pain. In rare cases, untreated Lyme disease may cause frank psychosis, which has been misdiagnosed as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Panic attacks and anxiety can occur; also, delusional behavior may be seen, including somatoform delusions, sometimes accompanied by a depersonalization or derealization syndrome, where the patients begin to feel detached from themselves or from reality.|$|E
25|$|Crawford {{had a short}} {{comeback}} to Broadway as the Count von Krolock in {{the short-lived}} musical Dance of the Vampires (2002–03). He originated {{the role of the}} morbidly obese Count Fosco in Lloyd Webber's The Woman in White, which opened at the Palace Theatre, London in September 2004. However, he was forced to leave the show three months later because of ill health caused by dehydration resulting from the enormous fat-suit he wore during the performance. He spent several months recuperating and was thus unable to reprise the role on Broadway. He learned he was suffering from the post-viral condition myalgic <b>encephalomyelitis</b> (ME), which debilitated him for six years.|$|E
25|$|Sheep may be {{infected}} by four recognized species of Sarcocystis: S. arieticanis and S. tenella (S. ovicanis) are pathogenic; S. gigantea (S. ovifelis) and S. medusiformis are non-pathogenic. Infection with these parasites {{is common in}} the US with over 80% of sheep examined showing evidence of infection. S. arieticanis and S. tenella both produce extra intestinal disease. Anemia, anorexia, ataxia, and abortions are the chief clinical signs. Myositis with flaccid paralysis has been reported {{as a consequence of}} infection. Ovine protozoan myeloencephalitis is a recognised syndrome that may occur in outbreaks. The usual pathological findings in such cases are multifocal spinal cord white matter oedema and necrosis, glial nodules and mild to moderate nonsuppurative <b>encephalomyelitis.</b> The diagnosis may be established finding protozoan bodies (12.7-23.0 micrometres) that stain immunocytochemically for Sarcocystis epitopes.|$|E
25|$|Stiff-limb {{syndrome}} is {{a variant of}} SPS. This syndrome develops into full SPS about 25 percent of the time. Stiffness and spasms are usually limited to the legs and hyperlordoisis generally does not occur. The stiffness begins in one limb and remains most prominent there. Sphincter and brainstem issues often occur with stiff-limb syndrome. Progressive <b>encephalomyelitis</b> with rigidity, another variant of the condition, includes symptoms of SPS with brainstem issues and autonomic disturbances. It involves polio-encephalomyelitis in the spine and brainstem. There is cerebellar and brainstem involvement. In some cases, the limbic system is affected, as well. Most patients have upper motoneuron issues and autonomic disturbances. Jerking man syndrome or jerking SPS is another subtype of the condition. It begins like classical SPS and progresses for several years, up to 14 in some cases. It is then distinguished {{by the development of}} myoclonus as well as seizures and ataxia in some cases.|$|E
500|$|Barry was {{distinguished}} in {{the subsequent}} case R. v. East Sussex County Council, ex parte Tandy (1998), in which the reduction of home tuition services provided by East Sussex County Council to a young myalgic <b>encephalomyelitis</b> (chronic fatigue syndrome) sufferer was challenged. The services were reduced due to {{a cut in the}} authority's home tuition budget. Lord Browne-Wilkinson, speaking for the House of Lords, noted that the statute in question in Barry had required the decision-maker to assess the [...] "needs" [...] of disabled people and whether arranging for home care services to be provided was [...] "necessary in order to meet" [...] those needs. The statute only listed the services that could be provided, and did not define what [...] "needs" [...] meant. Thus, it was [...] "perhaps not surprising" [...] that the court had laid down the availability of resources as a criterion for determining what should be considered [...] "needs". On the other hand, in Tandy the statute involved imposed on the authority a duty to arrange to provide [...] "suitable education" [...] to the applicant, which was defined according to [...] "wholly objective educational criteria". Financial resources were not mentioned at all. In the circumstances, the judge held that the extent of the latter was not a consideration relevant to the authority's decision. He also commented that since it had not been submitted that the authority lacked resources to perform its duty, this was a situation of the authority preferring to spend money on other matters. Thus, the authority could divert funds from discretionary matters and apply them to fulfil its statutory duty.|$|E

2500|$|The {{mortality}} {{rate of the}} virus largely depends on the immune status of the infected dogs. Puppies experience the highest {{mortality rate}}, where complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis are more common.

2500|$|From 1934 onwards, {{outbreaks}} of a previously unknown illness {{began to be}} recorded by doctors. Initially [...] considered to be occurrences of [...] poliomyelitis, the illness was subsequently referred to as [...] "epidemic neuromyasthenia". In the 1950s, the term [...] "benign myalgic encephalomyelitis" [...] was used {{in relation to a}} comparable outbreak at the Royal Free Hospital in London. The descriptions of each outbreak were varied, but included symptoms of malaise, tender lymph nodes, sore throat, pain, and signs of <b>encephalomyelitis.</b> The cause of the condition was not identified, although it appeared to be infectious, and the term [...] "benign myalgic encephalomyelitis" [...] was chosen to reflect the lack of mortality, the severe muscular pains, evidence of damage to the nervous system, and to the presumed inflammatory nature of the disorder. The syndrome appeared in sporadic as well as epidemic cases and in 1969, benign myalgic <b>encephalomyelitis</b> appeared as an entry to the International Classification of Diseases under Diseases of the nervous system.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "chronic fatigue syndrome" [...] {{has been}} criticized by {{patients}} as being both stigmatizing and trivializing, and which in turn prevents the illness from being seen as a serious health problem that deserves appropriate research. While many patients prefer [...] "myalgic encephalomyelitis", which they believe better reflects the medical nature of the illness, there is [...] resistance amongst clinicians toward the use of myalgic <b>encephalomyelitis</b> {{on the grounds that}} the inflammation of the central nervous system (myelitis) implied by the term has not been demonstrated.|$|E
2500|$|The above signs, {{especially}} fever, respiratory signs, neurological signs, and thickened footpads {{occurring in}} unvaccinated dogs strongly indicate canine distemper. [...] However, several febrile diseases match {{many of the}} signs of the disease and only recently has distinguishing between canine hepatitis, herpes virus, parainfluenza and leptospirosis been possible. [...] Thus, finding the virus by various methods in the dog's conjunctival cells or foot pads gives a definitive diagnosis. [...] In older dogs that develop distemper <b>encephalomyelitis,</b> diagnosis may be more difficult, since many of these dogs have an adequate vaccination history.|$|E
2500|$|The {{authors of}} {{a review of}} 15 {{outbreaks}} of benign myalgic <b>encephalomyelitis,</b> carried out in 1970, concluded that these were psychosocial phenomena caused by either mass hysteria {{on the part of}} the patients or altered medical perception of the community. These conclusions were based on the higher prevalence of the disease in females in whom there was a lack of physical signs. On that basis, the authors recommended that the disease should be renamed [...] "myalgia nervosa". Despite strong refutation by Dr. Melvin Ramsay, the proposed psychological cause created great controversy, and convinced health professionals that this was a plausible explanation for the condition.|$|E
2500|$|Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHL, or AHLE), {{also known}} as acute necrotizing {{encephalopathy}} (ANE), acute hemorrhagic <b>encephalomyelitis</b> (AHEM), acute necrotizing hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (ANHLE), Weston-Hurst syndrome, or Hurst's disease, is a hyperacute and frequently fatal form of ADEM. AHL is relatively rare (less than 100 cases {{have been reported in}} the medical literature [...] ), it is seen in about 2% of ADEM cases, and is characterized by necrotizing vasculitis of venules and hemorrhage, and edema. Death is common in the first week and overall mortality is about 70%, but increasing evidence points to favorable outcomes after aggressive treatment with corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, cyclophosphamide, and plasma exchange. About 70% of survivors show residual neurological deficits, but some survivors have shown surprisingly little deficit considering the magnitude of the white matter affected.|$|E
2500|$|Adverse reactions, rarely serious, {{may occur}} from each {{component}} of the MMR vaccine. Ten percent of children develop fever, malaise, and a rash 5–21 days after the first vaccination; and 3% develop joint pain lasting 18 days on average. Older women {{appear to be more}} at risk of joint pain, acute arthritis, and even (rarely) chronic arthritis. Anaphylaxis is an extremely rare but serious allergic reaction to the vaccine. One cause can be egg allergy. In 2014, the FDA approved two additional possible adverse events on the vaccination label for acute disseminated <b>encephalomyelitis</b> (ADEM), and transverse myelitis, with permission to also add [...] "difficulty walking" [...] to the package inserts.

2500|$|The virus first {{appears in}} {{bronchial}} lymph nodes and tonsils {{two days after}} exposure. [...] The virus then enters the blood stream on {{the second or third}} day. [...] A first round of acute fever tends to begin around three to eight days after infection, which is often accompanied by a low white blood cell count, especially of lymphocytes, as well as low platelet count. [...] These signs {{may or may not be}} accompanied by anorexia, a runny nose, and discharge from the eye. [...] This first round of fever typically recedes rapidly within 96 hours, and then a second round of fever begins around the 11th or 12th day and lasts at least a week. [...] Gastrointestinal and respiratory problems tend to follow, which may become complicated with secondary bacterial infections. [...] Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, otherwise known as <b>encephalomyelitis,</b> either is associated with this, subsequently follows, or comes completely independent of these problems. A thickening of the footpads sometimes develops, and vesicularpustular lesions on the abdomen usually develop. Neurological signs typically are found in the animals with thickened footpads from the virus. About half of sufferers experience meningoencephalitis. Less than 50% of the adult dogs that contract the disease die from it. Among puppies, the death rate often reaches 80%.|$|E
