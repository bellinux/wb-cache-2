40|$|The thesis aims to {{introduce}} the problem of panel <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> in the Czech Republic, to evaluate the development policy of these areas and to suggest the possibilities of transformation of Prague panel <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> {{in order to enhance}} quality of residential environment. In the Czech Republic lives a substantial part of the population in the panel <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> and their degradation is a real threat that could lead to the decline of entire cities. About 40 % of Prague's residents live in <b>housing</b> <b>estates,</b> which are an indispensable part of urban structure of the capital city, and therefore the thesis focuses on Prague's <b>housing</b> <b>estates.</b> Through a literature research the theoretical part deals in major with the circumstances of creation and specifics of Czech panel housing with focus on the Prague <b>housing</b> <b>estates.</b> The theoretical part concludes that the future of <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> will depend on the attitude of public authorities and its residents as we cannot rely on the fact that leaving <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> their own development will not lead to their degradation. The practical part aims {{to introduce}} national and local key documents and programs, which involve <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> transformation issues and assesses their importance and contribution to the transformation process itself. Further, there are introduced examples of foreign and Czech transformations and using SWOT analysis there is assessed the potential usability of these measures in the transformation of Prague <b>housing</b> <b>estates.</b> The end of practical part performs a synthesis of previous findings and suggests the possibilities of transformation of Prague panel <b>housing</b> <b>estates,</b> which should increase the quality of the residential environment.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis is to capture the {{diversity}} of perceptions of <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> {{from the perspective of}} their population and from the outsiders' perspective. The thesis is divided into two parts. The theoretical part deals with the image of <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> and their positives and negatives. In the theoretical framework, also the studies of image of <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> from selected foreign countries are presented. The second empirical part is based on the analysis of semi-structured interviews conducted with 50 residents of 10 <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> in Prague and the results of focus group, which was conducted with 10 geography students who were generally familiar with the reputations of studied <b>housing</b> <b>estates.</b> These two research phases aimed to reveal, if the <b>housing</b> <b>estates</b> are perceived negatively as a place to live.
