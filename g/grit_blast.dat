50|$|Bristle blasting, is a {{mechanical}} abrasion cleaning {{process that is}} performed on metallic surfaces by a brush-like rotary power tool. The tool consists of sharpened, high-carbon steel wire bristle tips that are designed with a forward-angle bend, i.e., the shank of the wire is bent {{in the direction of}} tool rotation. During operation, the rotating bristle tips are brought into direct contact with the metallic surface, whereby the bristle tips strike the surface with kinetic energy that is equivalent to processes that use <b>grit</b> <b>blast</b> media. This repeated contact of sharp bristle tips with the target surface results in localized impact, rebound, and the formation of craters, thereby simultaneously cleaning and coarsening the surface, while exposing a contamination-free base metal.|$|E

Energetic processes such as laser ablation or plasma treatment are amenable to automation and are easily monitored and adjusted for controlled surface preparation. A laser ablation process was developed to accurately remove a targeted depth of resin, approximately 0. 1 to 20 micrometers, from a carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composite surface while simultaneously changing surface chemistry and creating micro-roughness. This work demonstrates the application of this process to prepare composite surfaces for bonding without exposing or damaging fibers on the surface. Composite panels were prepared in an autoclave and had a resin layer approximately 10 micrometers thick above the fiber reinforcement. These composite panels were laser surface treated using several conditions, fabricated into bonded panels and hygrothermally aged.

The coatings were erosion tested in a slurry jet facility and their performance compared with a D-gun 86 WC– 10 Co– 4 Cr coating that is currently widely used in service. Sand erosion tests were conducted at 28 m s? 1 and with 135 and 235 ?m sand, respectively. The eroded surfaces were examined so that the erosion mechanisms of each coating could be determined.

It was found that for cryogenic applications, a flexible, low modulus resin system must be used. Additionally, the samples prepared with {{a thin layer of}} cured resin - or prebond - performed significantly better than those without. It was found that it is critical that the prebond surface must have sufficient surface roughness prior to the bonding application. Also, the aluminum test pieces that were prepared using a surface etchant slightly outperformed those that were prepared with a <b>grit</b> <b>blast</b> surface finish and performed significantly better than those which had been scored using sand paper to achieve the desired surface finish.

The resistance to aseptic loosening of acetabular components with different surface coatings was investigated. Implants remained in vivo for 1 year. Sheep were {{randomly assigned to one of}} six experimental groups where the acetabular cup was fixed utilising an: (a) cemented polyethylene acetabular cup, (b) metal backed <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> surface, (c) metal backed plasma sprayed titanium porous coating, (d) metal backed sintered beaded coating, (e) Hydroxyapatite (HA) -coated <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> surface (f) and HA-coated porous components. Ground Reaction Force (GRF) was used to asses the functional performance of the implants and data was collected pre-operatively and at 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks post op. Wear debris generated was analysed and radiographs taken prior to preparation of thin sections. Fibrous tissue (FT) thickness and bone contact at 1 mm intervals along the acetabular bone-implant interface was calculated. GRF data demonstrated significant differences between experimental groups. In all groups there was an increase in the function of the hip after surgery and up to 24 weeks but thereafter the function of the group with the <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> surface reduced whereas the function of the other groups did not significantly change. Average wear particles generated were < 1 microm in size. The cemented group demonstrated a significantly thicker average FT layer (2. 69 mm) when compared with all other groups (p< 0. 05 in all cases) except the <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> group (1. 56 mm). HA porous coated cups demonstrated significantly least fibrous tissue adjacent to its interface when compared with all other groups (cemented p< 0. 05, <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> p= 0. 029, porous p< 0. 05, sintered beads p< 0. 05 and HA <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> p< 0. 05).

The macro-scaled roughness of the <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> zirconia discs, independent of the surface treatment, was within a narrow range and only slightly smoother than titanium discs. However, the alkaline- and acid-etching led to an increase of the micro-roughness of the surface.

Materials and Methods: Fifty cast commercially pure titanium discs (9 mm × 2 mm) were divided into five groups (n = 10), which received the following surface treatments: Control group (no surface treatment), group 1 (<b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> using 110 µm Al 2 O 3 particles and application of alloy primer), group 2 (<b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> using 110 µm Al 2 O 3 particles and chemical treatment using 1 N HCl), group 3 (chemical treatment using 1 N HCl and application of alloy primer), and group 4 (<b>Grit</b> <b>blasting</b> using 110 µm Al 2 O 3 particles, chemical treatment using 1 N HCl and application of alloy primer). Superbond C and B resin cement was applied to the treated titanium surfaces including controls. SBSs were determined after thermocycling for 5000 cycles. Data (megapascal) were analyzed by ANOVA and Bonferroni test. Results: Group 4 (<b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> using 110 µm Al 2 O 3 particles, chemical treatment using 1 N hydrochloric acid, and application of alloy primer) produced the highest bond strength followed by group 1, group 3, group 2, and the control group which showed the least bond strength. Conclusion: (1) Air-abrasion with alumina particles increases the micromechanical retention of the resin to titanium. (2) The alloy primer promotes wettability, which increases the adhesive bonding of resin cement to titanium.

A laser based process provides an alternative to chemical-dip, manual abrasion and <b>grit</b> <b>blast</b> treatments which are expensive, hazardous, polluting, and less precise. This report documents preliminary testing of a surface preparation technique using laser ablation as a replacement for the chemical etch and abrasive processes currently applied to Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy adherends.

Chemical analyses showed trends for surface chemical species which correlated with improved bond strength and durability. Combined, these results suggest that laser ablation is a viable process for inclusion with or/and replacement of one or more currently used titanium surface treatments.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of high speed laser surface modification on 316 L stainless steel and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V for biomedical implants application. Laser processing {{was carried out in}} an inert argon environment using a 1. 5 kW CO 2 laser. Parameters investigated in this work included irradiance, residence time, pulse width and sample pre-treatments. Surface topology, microstructure and melt pool depth were characterised using the scanning electron microscope. White light interferometry and stylus profilometry were used to determine the surface roughness. X-ray diffractometry was used to investigate the crystallinity and phase transformation induced by the laser treatment. Micro-hardness was measured using a Vickers micro-hardness indentation apparatus. Wear behaviour was investigated using a pin on disk apparatus. Corrosion behaviour was evaluated using a potentiostat and an electrochemical cell set-up simulating human body conditions. Biocompatibility of the samples was investigated in vitro by monitoring NIH/ 3 T 3 fibroblast and MC 3 T 3 -E 1 osteoblast cell growth via MTT and Hoechst DNA assays. A strong correlation between irradiance, residence time, depth of processing and roughness was established in 316 L. High depth of altered microstructure and increased roughness were linked to higher levels of both irradiance and residence times. At fixed energy density, increase in residence time resulted in growth of the melt pool. In the melted region, a uniform composition in microstructure with fewer impurities was observed. In Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy, laser treatment resulted in crack-free layers, twenty to fifty microns thick. With increase in both irradiance and residence time, surface roughness was found to decrease while melt pool depth increased. A martensite structure formed on the laser treated region producing acicular αTi nested within the aged βTi matrix. The βTi phase volume fraction was reduced by up to 19 %. Microhardness increased up to 760 HV 0. 05 which represented a 67 % increase compared to the bulk material. A homogenous chemical composition of the alloying elements was achieved in laser modified regions. Much lower levels of wear were noted in laser treated samples compared to untreated samples.

40|$|The aims of {{the study}} were to carry out a {{comparison}} of <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> and other surface pretreatment processes and identify the relation between <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> parameters and coating adhesion, because it can be assumed that the adhesion between substrate and coating strongly depends on the physical properties of the substrate surface. By this way, in order to improve the bonding between substrate and coating, it is necessary to study the influence of different surface pre-treatment parameters and to compare different pre-treatment techniques. <b>Grit</b> <b>blasting,</b> water jet blasting and mechanicals processes (milling and grinding) have been studied. In order to compare them, the roughness of the surface, the adhesive straights, the topography, the contact surface and the residual stresses have been the considered parameters to carry out the research. Two different substrates have been studied, AlMg 7 and St_ 42. For <b>grit</b> <b>blasting,</b> five different blasting parameters have been analyzed and combined to obtain reliable results, attack angle, air pressure, lineal velocity, number of passes, and distance between substrate and nozzle. After measuring the obtained values, the most influence parameters were recombined and analyzed to obtain better surface conditions. In the case of mechanicals processes (milling and grinding), the samples were studied for different mechanical parameters, analyzed and compared with the other surface pretreatments in order to obtain the most suitable method. For water jet blasting, eight samples were sent to WLH (University of Hannover) to be treated. To carry out the pretreatment, the velocity of the water jet blasting was modify while the other blasting parameters remained constant, in order to compare the obtained values of roughness, adhesion, activate area and residual stresses for water jet with <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> and mechanical processes. The next conclusions can be assumed: The roughness is not so important than the topography to obtain the best adhesive bonding between the substrate and the coating, and the best bonding was obtained for homogeneous topographies (obtained for water jet <b>blasting</b> and <b>grit</b> <b>blasting).</b> Comparing the surface pretreatments is observed that water jet blasting is the surface pretreatment method which leads to the highest bonding between substrate and coating. It can be assumed that a higher contact surface area leads to a better adhesion between substrate and coating.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{tribology}} of thermal sprayed WC-Co based coatings and covers the high energy air-sand erosion resistance and slurry jet impingement erosion performance, dry and wet sliding tribology of thermal spray WC-Co based coatings {{as well as the}} abrasion and abrasion-corrosion of these coatings. The tribological and tribo-corrosion performance of the coatings will be related to their mechanical and corrosion properties as well as deposition parameters, microstructure and actual composition. For example, the anisotropic microstructure of thermally sprayed WC–Co–Cr coatings, in particular the low fracture toughness in a direction parallel to the substrate, has been observed to affect the nature of crack formation under 200 ?J air-solid particle erosion conditions. Voids and occasionally other microstructural features (i. e. cobalt lakes, splat boundaries, interfacial inclusions) in the coating act as crack initiation sites. The erosion rate was dominated by cracks within 5 ?m of the surface and was relatively insensitive to total length of cracks, showing a near-surface damage front controls the erosion rate and this region is coincident with the region of maximum shear stress induced by erodent impacts. Optimisation of the deposition parameters of HVOF 86 WC– 10 Co– 4 Cr coatings show an improvement in erosion resistance of more than 50 % over the conventional D-gun applied coating of identical nominal composition. The variation in the slurry erosion performance of the thermally sprayed coatings is also linked to directional fracture toughness and crack propagation paths which are influenced by the presence of pores, inhomogeneous carbide distributions and substrate <b>grit</b> <b>blast</b> remnants. The influence of slurry jet angle is more pronounced under 0. 4 ?J energy conditions where maximum erosion occurred at 90 ° and the minimum at 30 ° in contrast to 7 ?J slurry erosion rates which were independent of jet angle. This reflects the lower levels of fluctuating stresses imparted to the coating during low energy slurry impacts leading to the impact angle having a greater effect on sub critical crack growth rate than for higher energy conditions. The abrasion resistance of these coatings was found comparable to sintered cermets of the same composition. The synergistic effects between micro and macro abrasion and corrosion for detonation gun (D-gun) sprayed WC– 10 Co– 4 Cr coatings are shown to be significant and depend on the environment. The size effect of the abradant relative to the microstructure and splat size is important as well as the propensity for the various phases to passivate to control corrosion levels. Comparisons between exposed and freshly polished coating surfaces in strong NaOH solutions (pH 11) show that significantly lower wear rates were seen for the exposed surface due to a negative wear–corrosion synergy due to selective phase removal and the effects of localised passivation. Dry and wet sliding wear resistance of these coatings is shown to be high (wear rates of 10 - 16 to 10 - 18 m 3 /Nm) with modest coefficient of friction levels between 0. 2 and 0. 5. The presence of oxides on the binder phases appears to influence the friction and wear levels. Wear appears to be by carbide ejection and/or by tribo-chemical processes...|$|E

The primary initiative of the WINCO Decontamination Development Program is the development of methods to eliminate/minimize the use of sodium-bearing decontamination chemicals. One method that was chosen for cold scoping studies during FY- 93 was abrasive <b>grit</b> <b>blasting.</b> Abrasive <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> has been used in many industries and a vast amount of research and development has already been conducted. However, new grits, process improvements and ICPP applicability was investigated. This evaluation report is a summary of the research efforts and scoping tests using the liquid abrasive <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> decontamination technique. The purpose of these scoping tests was to determine the effectiveness of three different abrasive grits: plastic beads, glass beads and alumina oxide...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of high temperature low cycle fatigue tests carried out on Inconel 713 LC. This polycrystalline nickel based superalloys is mainly used for high temperature applications such as disks, blades and vanes of gas turbine engines. These machine components are manufactured by investment casting and undergo a series of postcast processes to remove remnants of shells, oxides and other contaminants. <b>Grit</b> <b>blasting</b> {{is one of the most}} widely used and cheapest technology ensuring adequate cleaning of the surface and at the same time is used to treat the substrate surface prior to application of metalic bond coat and various protective coatings (like diffusion, overlay or thermall barier coatings). Low cycle fatigue tests were conducted on as-received and <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> material in fully reversed pull-push cycle in strain control mode with constant total strain amplitude and strain rate at 900 °C in air. Experimental data on fatigue life were evaluated and parameters of Baquin and Coffin-Manson curves were obtained for both tested materials. Specimen surface and cross sections of both treated and untreated materials were analysed prior to fatigue tests and also after testing by means of optical microscopy (OM), as well as scaning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Vickers microhardness was measured. Fatigue degradation mechanisms was documented in both materials and negligible effect of <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> on low cycle parameters was discussed...|$|R
40|$|Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBC) {{have been}} used {{for a number of years}} on {{components}} for use in aircraft gas turbine engines. The standard for processing these components includes <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> the bond coat prior to TBC deposition by Electron Beam Physical Vapor Deposition (EBPVD). While <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> has worked well for industry, it is argued that EBPVD TBC's are able to form strong bonds on smoother surface finishes. This would theoretically improve the component lifetime. This study involved the examination of the performance and failure of several industrially and economically viable alternative surface finishes as well as the effect of pre-oxidation treatments on the lifetime of the TBC. The system used consisted of a substrate of CMSX 4 (Ni based superalloy), a platinum modified diffusional aluminide coating, and yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ) deposited by EBPVD as the TBC. Surface finishes applied prior to TBC deposition include 120 and 40 minute media finishes, barrel finish, and 3 mm hand polish. The various atmospheres were chosen for the pre-oxidation treatments in order to grow metastable and stable alumina scales. Exposure was done cyclically (1 hour cycles) at 1121 oC in laboratory air until failure. Samples with the combination of media finish and mostly a alumina scales had lifetimes up to 1040 cycles. This is well beyond the expected value (~ 750 cycles) of a <b>grit</b> <b>blasted</b> sample in the same exposure conditions...|$|R
30|$|The {{experimental}} program consists, {{first to}} damage the short reinforced concrete corbels at different loads respectively at 45, 65 and 90  % of their ultimate load and secondly to repair them and load to failure. The repair used bonding technique with cleaning concrete corbel surfaces by <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> method and gluing carbon fibre fabrics.|$|R
40|$|Adhesion was {{studied with}} {{emphasis}} on the characterization of surface oxide layers, the analysis of fracture surfaces, and the interaction of matrices and fibers. A number of surface features of the fractured lap shear samples were noted in the SEM photomicrographs including the beta phase alloy of the Ti 6 - 4 adherend, the imprint of the adherend on the adhesive failure surface, increased void density for high temperature samples, and the alumina filler particles. Interfacial failure {{of some of the}} fractured lap shear samples is invariably characterized by the appearance of an ESCA oxygen photopeak at 530. 3 eV assigned to the surface oxide layer of Ti 6 - 4 adherend. The effect of <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> on carbon fiber composites is evident in the SEM analysis. A high surface fluorine concentration on the composite surface is reduced some ten fold by <b>grit</b> <b>blasting...</b>|$|R
40|$|The surface {{preparation}} by hydrodynamic profiling and <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> of low-carbon steel specimens is investigated. Roughness measurements and SEM imaging show that hydrodynamic profiling forms a surface profile {{with a high}} roughness and without surface contamination. In contrast, grit-blasted specimens show grit residues embedded in the substrate surface. The debris collected after hydrodynamic profiling show a rounded shape suggesting that the material is removed due to low-cycle fatigue. The debris produced by <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> appear {{in the shape of}} platelets and flow-type chips suggesting a mixture of micro-cutting and forging-extrusion. The influence of stand-off distance, exposure time, and flow speed on the profiling process are also studied. The results identified the optimum operational conditions for hydrodynamic profiling. Fatigue by impacting fluid drops is suggested to be the dominant material failure mode. However, results of a comparative calculation of the incubation drop impact frequency suggests that fatigue is accompanied by energy-dissipative processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> for thermal spray {{applications}} is to ensure a strong mechanical bond between the substrate and the coating by the enhanced roughening of the substrate material. This study presents statistically designed experiments that were accomplished to investigate the effect of abrasives on roughness for A 36 / 1020 steel. The experiments were conducted using a Box statistical design of experiment (SDE) approach. Three <b>grit</b> <b>blasting</b> parameters and their effect on the resultant substrate roughness were investigated. These include blast media, blast pressure, and working distance. The substrates were characterized for roughness using surface profilometry. These attributes were correlated with the changes in operating parameters. Twin-Wire Electric Arc (TWEA) coatings of aluminum and zinc/aluminum were deposited on the grit-blasted substrates. These coatings were then tested for bond strength. Bond strength studies were conducted utilizing a portable adhesion tester following ASTM standard D 4541...|$|R
