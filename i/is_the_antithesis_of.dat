5|$|Viswanathan (T. S. Balaiah) is an arrogant, money-minded {{estate owner}} {{who lives in}} a {{bungalow}} called Chinnamalai Estate near Pollachi. His son Chellappa (Nagesh) is an aspiring filmmaker; Chellappa <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> his father and voices his displeasure at his father's arrogance. Viswanathan also has two daughters; Kanchana (Kanchana) and Nirmala (Rajasree). Kanchana is in love with her college mate Vasu (R. Muthuraman), the son of a rich Chennai-based businessman Sachidanandam (V. S. Raghavan). The sisters return home after completing their education in Chennai. One day while out sightseeing, a battered car driven by their father's young, rebellious estate manager Ashok (Ravichandran) bumps into their car. The sisters quarrel with Ashok and are annoyed by his insolence. At their home, they force Viswanathan to dismiss Ashok. Infuriated, Ashok pitches a tent overlooking their bungalow and begins a strike to get his job back. Nirmala accidentally drops a bucket of water on Ashok's head, hurting him. Feeling guilty, she visits Ashok's tent to apologise and they fall in love.|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Widmerpool is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in Anthony Powell's novel sequence A Dance to the Music of Time, a 12-volume account of upper-class and bohemian [...] life in Britain between 1920 and 1970. Regarded by critics {{as one of}} the more memorable characters of 20th century fiction, Widmerpool <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> the sequence's narrator-hero Nicholas Jenkins. Initially presented as a comic, even pathetic figure, he becomes increasingly formidable, powerful and ultimately sinister as the novels progress. [...] He is successful in business, in the army and in politics, and is awarded a life peerage. His only sphere of failure is his relationships with women, exemplified by his disastrous marriage to Pamela Flitton. The sequence ends with Widmerpool's downfall and death, in circumstances arising from his involvement with a New Age-type cult.|$|E
500|$|In a 1969 {{column for}} The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau said that, apart from The Mothers of Invention's We're Only in It for the Money, Tommy {{is the first}} {{successful}} [...] "extended work" [...] in rock music, but Townshend's parodic side is more [...] "profound and equivocal" [...] than Frank Zappa. He praised Townshend for deliberately constructing the album so that each song can be enjoyed individually and felt that {{he is determined to}} [...] "give his audience what it wants without burying his own peculiarity". Albert Goldman, writing in Life magazine, said that The Who play through [...] "all the kinky complications" [...] of the narrative in a hard rock style that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> most contemporary [...] "serious" [...] rock. Goldman asserted that, based on innovation, performance, and [...] "sheer power", Tommy surpasses anything else in studio-recorded rock. Christgau named Tommy the best album of 1969 in his year-end list for Jazz & Pop magazine.|$|E

50|$|Bishop Weisgerber {{has spoken}} against plans to legalize {{euthanasia}} in Canada, {{saying that it}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> what should <b>be</b> at <b>the</b> heart of human civilization: trust, respect, concern and solidarity, based on reverence for all human life.|$|R
50|$|During this time, Bungert was {{considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> Wagner - Wagner's works drew themes from Norse mythology, while Bungert's libretti <b>were</b> influenced by <b>the</b> Greek classics. Bungert was strongly influenced by Wagner, and planned to build a Bayreuth-style theatre in Bad Godesberg.|$|R

[...] Brown's verse continues with [...] "Been a long time I've been missing your body/ Turn the lights down/ When I go down it's a private party." [...] Brown delivers his vocals in an aggressive and manipulative manner as he sings [...] "Give it {{to her in the}} worst way, can't wait to blow her candles out." [...] At the end of the song, Rihanna performs new lyrics which were not included on the original 1 minute and 18 second interlude; [...] "Remember how you did it/ If you still wanna kiss it/ Then come and get it." [...] According to Ben Rayner of the Toronto Sun, the instrumentation of [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] consists of [...] "snaky, slurpy, bass-droppin' beats." [...] The song's lyrics revolve around sadomasochistic sexuality and dominance over men, and consists mainly of oral sex metaphors, including the lyric [...] "Doggy want the kitty." ...|$|E
500|$|Roberts {{described}} Joseph as an [...] "awkward {{and very}} bookish" [...] character, one who struggled {{to relate to}} his patients, {{in contrast to the}} [...] "happy-go-lucky Sam", which resulted in comedy as [...] "Sam <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> Joe." [...] He also deemed his character [...] "incredibly honest and morally upright", [...] "a total oddball with all sorts of hang-ups", and as being [...] "very stuck in his ways." [...] During his tenure, these aspects of his characterisation have each been explored. It was revealed in Joseph's first appearance that both his father and grandfather had been pioneering cardiothoracic Consultants, and that it had always been expected of him to follow the same path. [...] His residual guilt over his brother's attempted suicide was developed throughout his first few months at Holby City Hospital. Roberts commented on the event that: [...] "It underpins much of his behaviour. He is a man burdened by guilt and loss. I think I can be so bold as to say he transfers many of his feelings about his brother onto patients and staff alike, without ever betraying the source of his pain." [...] Joseph's resultant fastidiousness developed into OCD, something he attempted to control and hide by use of relaxant medication.|$|E
500|$|Bianco {{observed}} that [...] "On most shows, linking two main characters like Monica and Chandler {{would have been}} an act of desperation." [...] However, [...] "On Friends, it was a stroke of genius that made both characters more appealing while providing a needed diversion from the show's central task: Retaining a romantic equilibrium between Ross and Rachel." [...] Monica and Chandler's relationship <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> Ross and Rachel's because it remained [...] "healthy and strong until the series ended", while the other couple was relentlessly on-and-off. Encyclopedia of Television author Horace Newcomb believes that Monica's feelings for Chandler are responsible for curing the latter's fear of commitment. Similarly, Slate writer Ruth Graham {{observed that}} [...] "Chandler is painted as a self-loathing loser with women, until he finally snags Monica at the end of Season 4." [...] Meanwhile, Silveri believes that Friends ultimately ran as long as it did due in part to Monica and Chandler's romance, explaining, [...] "if the center of Friends had remained Ross and Rachel, you would've seen a much shorter shelf life for the show"; Monica and Chandler's arc is believed to have extended the series by approximately three years. Crane and Kauffman had always intended to give Monica and Chandler a child. [...] When it finally came time for them to write the finale, the idea of the couple adopting newborn twins was conceived at the last minute simply [...] "for fun". [...] The birth of Monica and Chandler's twins serves as one of the finale's main plots. They were named Jack and Erica – after Monica's father and their birth mother, respectively. – The twins are born three minutes and forty-six seconds apart. Although the surprise addition of Monica and Chandler's twins was generally well received, critics questioned the fact that the babies are brought home from the hospital the same day as their delivery ...|$|E

2500|$|Chemiluminescence {{differs from}} {{fluorescence}} or phosphorescence {{in that the}} electronic excited state {{is the product of}} a chemical reaction rather than of the absorption of a photon. [...] It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> a photochemical reaction, in which light is used to drive an endothermic chemical reaction. [...] Here, light is generated from a chemically exothermic reaction. The chemiluminescence might be also induced by an electrochemical stimulus, in this case is called electrochemiluminescence.|$|E

[...] Avery describes the pose as [...] "The impression is of a momentary action that has been frozen: the left arm and leg both project well forward, suspended freely in space, in an extraordinary pose that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> the canonical Renaissance contrapposto".|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that narcissism in adults is related to defenses against shame and that narcissistic personality disorder is connected to shame as well. [...] According to psychiatrist Glen Gabbard, NPD can be broken down into two subtypes, a grandiose, arrogant, thick-skinned [...] "oblivious" [...] subtype and an easily hurt, oversensitive, ashamed [...] "hypervigilant" [...] subtype. The oblivious subtype presents for admiration, envy, and appreciation a grandiose self that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> a weak internalized self which hides in shame, while the hypervigilant subtype neutralizes devaluation by seeing others as unjust abusers.|$|E
2500|$|Chatwin's admiration was effusive: [...] "By common consent, {{the art of}} the {{drop-out}} {{generation is}} a mess -- and the art of Donald Evans <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> mess. [...] Nor is it niggling. [...] Nor is it precious. [...] Yet I can't think of another artist who expressed more succinctly and beautifully the best aspirations of those years: [...] the flight from war and the machine; the asceticism; the nomadic restlessness; the yearning for sensual cloud-cuckoo-lands; the retreat from public into private obsessions, from the big and noisy to the small and still." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{governor}} of the Banca Romana {{at the time of}} the scandal, Bernardo Tanlongo, was a peculiar man, semi-literate but with a genius for accounts and finance. [...] "He was not a womanizer, he never played, he <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> all elegance, his frugality resembles avarice," [...] was how the Corriere della Sera once described him. A former farm hand and former spy during the short-lived Roman Republic in 1849, he made his career in the bank in the Papal State, providing illicit entertainment to Vatican officials. Tanlongo remained at his post in the Banca Romana after the unification of Italy and was promoted governor in 1881. He had a remarkable ability to secure friendships and protection by providing loans to cover up secrets.|$|E

50|$|Daibutsuyō - a Japanese {{religious}} {{architectural style}} which {{emerged in the}} late 12th or early 13th century {{on the basis of}} contemporary Chinese architecture.

2500|$|Humanitarianism {{is based}} on a view that all human beings deserve respect and dignity and should be treated as such. Therefore, humanitarians work towards {{advancing}} the well-being of humanity as a whole. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> the [...] "us vs. them" [...] mentality that characterizes tribalism and ethnic nationalism. Humanitarians abhor slavery, violation of basic and human rights, and {{discrimination on the basis of}} features such as skin colour, religion, ancestry, or place of birth. Humanitarianism drives people to save lives, alleviate suffering, and promote human dignity in the middle of man-made or natural disasters. Humanitarianism is embraced by movements and people across the political spectrum. The informal ideology can be summed up by a quote from Albert Schweitzer: [...] "Humanitarianism consists in never sacrificing a human being to a purpose." ...|$|E
2500|$|Law Courts, {{designed}} by the Richard Rogers Partnership, Arup and VK Studio, and opened by King Albert II, in April 2006.

The courtrooms sit on top of six fingers that radiate from an airy central hall, and are surmounted by spires, which provide north light and resemble oast houses or the sails of barges on the nearby River Scheldt. It is built {{on the site of}} the old Zuid ("South") station, at the end of a magnificent [...] perspective at the southern end of Amerikalei. The road neatly disappears into an underpass under oval Bolivarplaats to join the motorway ring. This leaves peaceful surface access by foot, bicycle or tram (route 12).

2500|$|The Zapatistas' {{response}} {{to the introduction of}} NAFTA in 1994, it is argued, reflects the shift in perception taking place in societies that have experienced colonialism. The theory of [...] "postcolonial gaze" [...] studies what is described as the cultural and political impacts of colonization on formerly colonized societies and how these societies overcome centuries of discrimination and marginalization by colonialists and their descendents. In Mexico, the theory of the postcolonial gaze is being fostered predominantly in areas of large indigenous populations and marginalization, like Chiapas. Over the last 20 years, Chiapas is said to have emerged as a formidable force against the Mexican government, fighting against structural violence and social and economic marginalization brought on by globalization. The Zapatista rebellion not only raised many questions about the consequences of globalization and free trade; it also questioned the long-standing ideas created by the Spanish colonial system. Postcolonialism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> imperialism because it attempts to explain how the prejudices and restrictions created by colonialism are being overcome. This is especially obvious in countries that have large social and economic inequalities, where colonial ideas are deeply entrenched {{in the minds of the}} colonials' descendents.|$|E

2500|$|Ratings for Smallvilles {{second season}} were up 23% {{from the same}} point last year. It also surpassed 7th Heaven as The WB's most popular show. Gough {{contributes}} much of the second season's success to the family dynamic between Clark and his parents, whose emotional core provided {{a large part of}} the appeal, as was the move away from the overused [...] "freak of the week" [...] story lines. Gough stated, [...] "Most of the time (on TV), the kids are smart, the parents are clueless and they never talk to each other. Ours <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>antithesis</b> <b>of</b> that.

That was also a move to #113 overall in the Nielsen ratings, up from #115 the year before. The season's fourth episode, [...] "Red", the season's seventeenth episode [...] "Rosetta", and the season finale, [...] "Exodus", were selected in The Futon Critic's 50 best episodes of 2002 and 2003, respectively.
