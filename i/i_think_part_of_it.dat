Responding to the band's concerns, Guggenheim said, [...] "I tell the story that's in front of me, warts and all. In the rock 'n' roll business, it's about adding layers.

He remarked, [...] "They said from the beginning, we want you to make the movie that you want to make and they let me make the movie I wanted to make.

Then I did some shows with them and I toured with Sade, so I spent a decent amount of time on the road, and then I spent {{the past couple of years}} on the album. It took a little longer on this album than on previous albums, but I’m really just a year off my pace." [...] He also spoke about working with Kanye West on the album, saying: [...] "I worked with Kanye more on this album than I had before, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is just us connecting and getting together to create, given how busy he is and how busy I am. Just finding time for us to work together kind of added a little bit of extra time to the process. But I think it was worth it." [...] He also spoke about how he feels this is his best album yet, saying: [...] "I feel like it’s my best album yet, and I think creatively, we did some great things. The collaboration and the talent that we have on the album is better than we’ve ever had. As far as producers, co-writers and people just helping shape the sound.

There is a kind of religion in science; it is the religion of a person who believes there is order and harmony in the Universe. Every event can be explained in a rational way as the product of some previous event; every effect must have its cause, there is no First Cause. … This religious faith of the scientist is violated by the discovery that the world had a beginning under conditions in which the known laws of physics are not valid, and as a product of forces or circumstances we cannot discover.
