In 1989, Aniston appeared on The Howard Stern Show, as a spokesmodel for Nutrisystem. That year, Aniston moved back to Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|During a {{momentary}} {{lull in the}} shooting, when it seemed safe, Ziemba's daughter Rosa managed to run across first and then motioned to the others with her arm. Her signal was misunderstood. Believing it to be safe, Ziemba, holding his five-year-old grandson Yankele Ber by the hand, {{tried to make a}} run <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b> Wild screams and gunfire ensued. Ziemba fell to the floor; the others retreated under the ferocious assault.|$|E
2500|$|Potts' initial task {{had been}} to retake the village of Kokoda. In the end the 25th Brigade walked in and took vacant {{possession}} on 2 November, the Japanese having abandoned it some time before. The Japanese were by now a shadow of the powerful force that had faced Potts in August. The survivors were riddled with dysentery and starving. Some evidence points to cannibalism. Japanese war correspondent Seizo Okada reported that after receiving the order to return to Buna, [...] "for a time the soldiers remained stupefied among the rocks on the mountain side. Then they began to move, and once in retreat they fled <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life</b> ... discipline was completely forgotten".|$|E
6000|$|Come, {{let me take}} thee to my breast, [...] And pledge we ne'er shall sunder; [...] And I shall spurn as vilest dust [...] The world's {{wealth and}} grandeur: [...] And do I hear my Jeanie own [...] That equal {{transports}} move her? [...] I ask <b>for</b> <b>dearest</b> <b>life</b> alone, [...] That I may live to love her.|$|R
60|$|Seb. Then, thus adjured, On a king's word 'tis truth, but truth ill-timed; <b>For</b> her <b>dear</b> <b>life</b> is now exposed anew, Unless you wholly {{can put on}} divinity, And graciously forgive.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Art thou only a beginner?' said E23, labouring {{literally}} <b>for</b> the <b>dear</b> <b>life,</b> as he {{slid out}} of his body-wrappings and stood clear in the loin-cloth while Kim splashed in a noble caste-mark on the ash-smeared brow.|$|R
60|$|Toby {{bent his}} {{head over the}} pail and stirred away as if <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{struck the}} bear one hasty blow {{with his gun}} stock and then ran <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
60|$|Even now, {{when two}} of the intruders were wounded and the third running <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life,</b> Isaac was {{doubtful}} {{as to whether he}} should show himself.|$|E
60|$|Marguerite was so happy, {{she could}} have stayed here for ever, hearing his voice, asking a hundred questions. But at mention of Chauvelin's name she started in quick alarm, afraid <b>for</b> the <b>dear</b> <b>life</b> she would have died to save.|$|R
60|$|For {{several minutes}} it buzzed and droned, that mystic implement, growing louder and louder, till it roared like thunder. One after another, {{the men of}} the island rushed in as if mad or in flight for their lives before some fierce beast {{pursuing}} them. They ran up, panting, and dripping with sweat; their hands clapped to their foreheads; their eyes starting wildly from their staring sockets; torn and bleeding and lacerated by the thorns and branches of the jungle, for each man ran straight across country from the spot where he lay asleep, {{in the direction of the}} sound, and never paused or drew breath, <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life's</b> sake, till he stood beside the corpse of the dead Tu-Kila-Kila.|$|R
60|$|So E Company, in its shirt-sleeves mainly, doubled <b>for</b> the <b>dear</b> <b>life,</b> and in {{the rear}} toiled the perspiring Sergeant, adjuring it to double yet faster. The {{cantonment}} was alive with {{the men of the}} 195th hunting for Wee Willie Winkie, and the Colonel finally overtook E Company, far too exhausted to swear, struggling in the pebbles of the river-bed.|$|R
60|$|And all {{the time}} I dared not look toward the land lest my heart should fail me. I {{released}} my grip at last and he ran forward as if fleeing <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
60|$|With {{the blood}} {{streaming}} {{down his face}} Jake ran <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life</b> in the direction taken by {{the remainder of the}} party, and now fully realizing the danger he had brought upon them.|$|E
60|$|To work {{went the}} two girls, ripping, fitting, basting, sewing <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b> By dint of unceasing effort {{they got the}} dress done by seven o'clock and Miranda tried it on in Rilla's room.|$|E

6000|$|Yoked in {{knowledge}} and remorse, now {{we come to}} rest, [...] Laughing at old villainies that Time has turned to jest, [...] Pardoning old necessities no pardon can efface-- [...] That undying sin we shared in Rouen marketplace. [...] Now we watch the new years shape, wondering if they hold [...] Fiercer lightnings in their heart than we launched of old. [...] Now we hear new voices rise, question, boast or gird, [...] As we raged (rememberest thou?) when our crowds were stirred, [...] Now we count new keels afloat, and new hosts on land, [...] Massed like ours (rememberest thou?) when our strokes were planned.

60|$|I {{am not a}} bit {{the worse}} of it, except fore-mentioned state of hands, a slight crick in my neck from the rain running down, and general {{stiffness}} from pulling, hauling, and tugging <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
6000|$|When he had trotted {{along for}} some {{distance}} {{he came upon}} a greyhound lying on the road, and panting <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b> 'Well, brother,' said the donkey, 'what's the matter with you? You look rather tired.' ...|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} the driver ceased {{speaking}} the engine {{was on its way}} out of the building, and Seth, swaying to and fro, clung <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life</b> to the guard-rail, as the mighty machine was drawn swiftly over the pavement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course he'd {{much the}} best of it to the last,--his {{character}} was so good. He had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous intentions; and his punishment was light. I was put in irons, brought to trial again, and sent for life. I didn't stop <b>for</b> <b>life,</b> <b>dear</b> boy and Pip's comrade, being here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let's down," [...] says I; {{but he was}} all {{the time}} {{employed}} in disengaging Trumpeter, whom {{he got out of}} the ditch, trembling and as quiet as possible. [...] "Let's down," [...] says I. [...] "Presently," [...] says he; and taking off his coat, he begins whistling and swishing down Trumpeter's sides and saddle; and when he had finished, what do you think the rascal did?--he just quietly mounted on Trumpeter's back, and shouts out, [...] "Git down yourself, old Bearsgrease; you've only to drop! I'LL give your 'oss a hairing arter them 'ounds; and you--vy, you may ride back my pony to Tuggeridgeweal!" [...] And with this, I'm blest if he didn't ride away, leaving me holding, as <b>for</b> the <b>dear</b> <b>life,</b> and expecting every minute the branch would break.|$|R
6000|$|If Bella saw such a book, Mr Boffin would {{instantly}} dart in and buy it. And still, as if {{they had}} not found it, they would seek out another book-shop, and Mr Boffin would say, 'Now, look well all round, my <b>dear,</b> <b>for</b> a <b>Life</b> of a Miser, or any book of that sort; any Lives of odd characters who may have been Misers.' ...|$|R
60|$|Leaning {{over the}} side, with {{two pairs of}} gloves on, I caught the double line, and as I pulled and Dan reeled the fish came up nearer. But I could not see him. Then I reached the leader and held on as <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
60|$|While {{this terrible}} fight <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life</b> was going on, the lifeboat-men were not idle. They ran out their good boat, the Constance, and {{launched}} her. And what a fearful launching that was! This boat {{belonged to the}} Institution, and her crew were justly proud of her.|$|E
6000|$|... "We can't buy {{anything}} so soft and good as worn out sheets and table-cloths. New ones wont do, or I'd cut up {{every one of}} mine," [...] said a newly married Wheeler, sewing <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life,</b> as she remembered the many cousins gone to the war.|$|E
6000|$|Up to this, I'd kept my seat {{as well as}} the best, for we'd {{only been}} {{trotting}} gently about the field until the dogs found; and I managed to stick on very well; but directly the tow-rowing began, off went Trumpeter like a thunderbolt, and I found myself playing among the dogs like the donkey among the chickens. [...] "Back, Mr. Coxe," [...] holloas the huntsman; and so I pulled very hard, and cried out, [...] "Wo!" [...] but he wouldn't; and on I went galloping <b>for</b> the <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b> How I kept on is a wonder; but I squeezed my knees in very tight, and shoved my feet very hard into the stirrups, and kept stiff hold of the scruff of Trumpeter's neck, and looked betwixt his ears as well as ever I could, and trusted to luck: for I was in a mortal fright, sure enough, as many a better man would be in such a case, let alone a poor hairdresser.|$|R
6000|$|For {{two seconds}} he hesitated. It was hateful even to temporize with so hideous a proposition. But for Muriel's sake, <b>for</b> her <b>dear</b> <b>life's</b> sake, he must meet these savages with guile for guile. [...] "If it be, indeed, {{the custom of}} Boupari," [...] he {{answered}} back, with pale and trembling lips, [...] "and if I, one man, am powerless to prevent it, I will give your message, myself, to the Queen of the Clouds, and you may send, as you say, your wedding decorations. But come what will--mark this--you shall not see her yourself to-day. You shall not speak to her. There I draw a line--so, with my stick in the dust, {{if you try to}} advance one step beyond, I stab you to the heart. Wait till to-morrow to take your prey. Give me one more night. Great god as you are, if you are wise, you will not drive an angry man to utter desperation." ...|$|R
60|$|The chase was long, {{for when}} a man is journeying {{literally}} <b>for</b> the <b>dear</b> <b>life,</b> he does not tarry upon the road. Round the world Hay swept anew, and overtook the wearied Doctor, who had been sent out to look for him, in Madras. It was there that he found the reward of his toil and the assurance of a blessed immortality. In half an hour the Doctor, watching always the parched lips, the shaking hands, and the eye that turned eternally to the east, won John Hay to rest in a little house close to the Madras surf. All that Hay need do was to hang by ropes {{from the roof of}} the room and let the round earth swing free beneath him. This was better than steamer or train, for he gained a day in a day, and was thus the equal of the undying sun. The other Hay would pay his expenses throughout eternity.|$|R
60|$|Then Hooker {{began to}} suck furiously {{at the little}} pink spot on the ball of his thumb--sucking <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b> Presently he felt a strange aching pain {{in his arms and}} shoulders, and his fingers seemed {{difficult}} to bend. Then he knew that sucking was no good.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Keep {{an eye on}} them, and let me {{know when}} they enter the avenue. It will take but a minute to tidy up and run down,' {{answered}} Mrs Jo, scribbling away <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life,</b> because serials wait for no man, not even the whole Christian Union en masse.|$|E
60|$|Next instant Felix found himself, he {{knew not}} how, {{struggling}} {{in a wild}} grapple with the dark, black water. A woman was clinging to him--clinging <b>for</b> <b>dear</b> <b>life.</b> But he couldn't have told you himself that minute how it all took place. He was too stunned and dazzled.|$|E
5000|$|Mr Boffin would say, 'Now, look {{well all}} round, my <b>dear,</b> <b>for</b> a <b>Life</b> of a Miser, or any book of that sort; any Lives of odd {{characters}} {{who may have}} been Misers.' .... The moment she pointed out any book as being entitled Lives of eccentric personages, Anecdotes of strange characters, Records of remarkable individuals, or anything to that purpose, Mr Boffin's countenance would light up, and he would instantly dart in and buy it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By which, nevertheless, we only {{increased}} our misery. For two fell from that cliff, as men asleep for very weariness, and miserably broke their bones; and others, whether {{by the great}} toil, or sunstrokes, or eating of strange berries, fell sick of fluxes and fevers; where was no drop of water, but rock of pumice stone as bare as {{the back of my}} hand, and full, moreover, of great cracks, black and without bottom, over which we had not strength to lift the sick, but were fain to leave them there aloft, in the sunshine, like Dives in his torments, crying aloud for a drop of water to cool their tongues; and every man a great stinking vulture or two sitting by him, like an ugly black fiend out of the pit, waiting till the poor soul should depart out of the corpse: but nothing could avail, and <b>for</b> the <b>dear</b> <b>life</b> we must down again and into the woods, or be burned up alive upon those rocks.|$|R
6000|$|It was a forlorn little jingle; {{the thick}} air seemed to pinch it off; {{and in the}} pauses Harvey heard the muffled shriek of a liner's siren, and he knew enough of the Banks to know what that meant. It came to him, with horrible distinctness, how a boy in a cherry-coloured jersey--he despised fancy blazers now with all a fisherman's contempt--how an ignorant, rowdy boy had once {{said it would be}} [...] "great" [...] if a steamer ran down a fishing-boat. That boy had a state-room with a hot and cold bath, and spent ten minutes each morning picking over a gilt-edged bill of fare. And that same boy--no, his very much older brother--was up at four of the dim dawn in streaming, {{crackling}} oilskins, hammering, literally <b>for</b> the <b>dear</b> <b>life,</b> on a bell smaller than the steward's breakfast-bell, while somewhere close at hand a thirty-foot steel stem was storming along at twenty miles an hour! The bitterest thought of all was that there were folks asleep in dry, upholstered cabins who would never learn that they had massacred a boat before breakfast. So Harvey rang the bell.|$|R
