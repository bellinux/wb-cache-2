5|$|Rowland (2009) {{identified}} {{an additional}} mechanism of countershading not previously analysed, namely that a round {{body like a}} cylinder illuminated and seen <b>from</b> <b>above</b> appears to have dark sides. Using a graphics tool, she demonstrated that this effect can be flattened out by countershading. Since predators are known to use edges to identify prey, countershading may therefore, she argues, make prey harder to detect when seen <b>from</b> <b>above.</b>|$|E

5|$|By {{including}} celestial motifs in clothing {{it becomes}} {{possible for the}} wearer to make claims the power on Earth is drawn <b>from</b> <b>above.</b> It {{has been said that}} the Shield of Achilles described by Homer is also a catalogue of constellations.

5|$|Lady Denman Drive, a roadway {{atop the}} dam wall, {{provides}} a third road crossing for the lake. It {{consists of a}} roadway and a bicycle path, and allows residents in western Canberra to cross the lake. This was possible because the dam gates are closed by pushing up from below, unlike most previous designs that wherein the gates were lifted <b>from</b> <b>above.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lemmings {{is divided}} {{into a number of}} levels, grouped into four {{difficulty}} categories. Each level begins with one or more trap doors opening <b>from</b> <b>above,</b> releasing a steady line of lemmings who all follow each other. Levels include a variety of obstacles that prevent lemmings from reaching the exit, such as large drops, booby traps and pools of lava.|$|E

5|$|Rammed {{earth is}} {{generally}} made without much water, {{and so does}} not need much time to dry as the building rises. It is susceptible to moisture, so must be laid on a course that stops rising dampness, must be roofed or covered to keep out water <b>from</b> <b>above,</b> and may need protection through some sort of plaster, paint or sheathing.|$|E
5|$|The Stalinist {{occupation}} of Eastern Europe {{was the issue}} of prime concern, and it raised many problems of interpretation. At first, the International held that, while the USSR was a degenerated workers' state, the post-World War II East European states were still bourgeois entities, because revolution <b>from</b> <b>above</b> was not possible, and capitalism persisted.|$|E
5|$|The building's name {{is based}} on its {{similarity}} to the cross-section of a strawberry viewed <b>from</b> <b>above.</b> When Strawberry Panic! was initially created, the three schools were arranged in a triangle, with the Strawberry Dorms in the center, and the dormitory {{was not a single}} building but three separate dormitories also arranged in a triangle around a central courtyard.|$|E

5|$|The two orbits do not intersect. When Pluto is {{closest to}} the Sun, and hence closest to Neptune's orbit as viewed <b>from</b> <b>above,</b> {{it is also the}} {{farthest}} above Neptune's path. Pluto's orbit passes about 8 AU above that of Neptune, preventing a collision.|$|E
5|$|When the IRT subway {{debuted in}} 1904, the typical tunnel {{construction}} method was cut-and-cover.

Temporary steel and wooden bridges carried surface traffic above the construction.|$|E

5|$|Where {{transparency}} {{cannot be}} achieved, {{it can be}} imitated effectively by silvering to make an animal's body highly reflective. At medium depths at sea, light comes <b>from</b> <b>above,</b> so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side. Most fish in the upper ocean such as sardine and herring are camouflaged by silvering.|$|E
5|$|A simple rule {{of thumb}} is that for {{high-pressure}} areas, where generally air flows from the center outward, the coriolis force given by the earth's rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earth's apparent rotation if viewed <b>from</b> <b>above</b> the hemisphere's pole. So, both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern. The opposite to these two cases occurs {{in the case of a}} high. These results derive from the Coriolis effect; that article explains in detail the physics, and provides an animation of a model to aid understanding.|$|E
5|$|Abel Starkey was {{a native}} of Roxbury, Massachusetts. The story of Starkey's capture was {{published}} by George Hubbard in The New England Magazine. Starkey was part of a gang of counterfeiters, including Stephen Burroughs, Samuel Corson and James Smith. Pursued by the authorities, Abel Starkey disappeared in the vicinity of a lightning splitter home that was owned by the Shephardson family. A thorough search of the house was conducted and the authorities found nothing. According to Hubbard, the house was the refuge of the counterfeiters for a number of years. After a time the public and authorities continued to track members of the gang to the location and investigations were performed only to turn up empty. Sheriff Johnson of Worcester tracked the counterfeiters to the house one day and set up a team of men outside and inside the house to uncover and arrest the counterfeiters. A careful search turned up nothing, so measurements of the house were taken to make sure no secret rooms or areas existed. With the inaccessible third attic all but ruled out, the discovery of its access through the chimney was by chance when an officer emptied out his trash into the fireplace. Contained in the trash was some snuff and a sneeze came <b>from</b> <b>above,</b> alerting the officers of hidden occupants in the chimney. After the fire had been extinguished and raked out, Sheriff Johnson attempted to climb up into the chimney. A brick was dropped <b>from</b> <b>above</b> and wounded him. The authorities capped the chimney and smoked the counterfeiters until they fell unconscious. Starkey was amongst the three arrested counterfeiters.|$|E
