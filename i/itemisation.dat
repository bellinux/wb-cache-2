50|$|Taxation of costs, {{now known}} as Detailed Assessment in English law {{following}} the Civil Procedure Act 1998, is a ministerial function performed by a court upon the resolution of case. It involves entering the various costs and their amounts against the party (either the Claimant or Defendant) against whom those costs have been awarded by the court. The <b>itemisation</b> of costs or the subsequent determination of the costs that should be allowed is not a determination {{of the outcome of}} the litigation.|$|E

The second part of the article is devoted to the methodological and theoretical status of the study of past emotions. It highlights how many studies in the history of emotions remain heavily conditioned by an idea of culture typical of Western philosophy of history...|$|E

Unfortunately his paper contains serious and systematic errors and misrepresentations about the causes and potential consequences of climate change, the overall effect {{of which is to}} convey an inaccurate and misleading impression of the scientific evidence. Indeed, the overall tone of Carter (2008) is one of a polemic rather than an objective analysis of the facts. An <b>itemisation</b> of all the inaccuracies in Carter (2008) would require a great deal of space, so this paper identifies and corrects {{some of the most important}} errors. global warming, human-caused global warming, climate change, economics of climate change, rationalist views on climate change, sceptical views on climate change...|$|E
40|$|To {{minimize}} {{the impact of}} end-of life vehicles on the environment {{they have to be}} managed in accordance with the legal requirements. Against this background it is important to comprehend the whereabouts of permanently decommissioned passenger cars. From the available statistical sources it was only possible to account for the whereabouts in parts for the last years. The subject-matter of the research project was the closure of this "statistical gap" to the maximum extent possible. The objectives of the project were the identification of the possible reasons underlying the "statistical gap", the determination, <b>itemisation</b> and, to the maximum extent possible, quantification of information on the actual whereabouts of permanently decommissioned vehicles and the development of measures and instruments {{that can be used to}} permanently improve the data situation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{an earlier}} study, the six {{phases of the}} {{economic}} product life cycle were complemented {{with a set of}} six qualitative ‘product phases’, which allows us to explain in what phases of the product life cycle qualities such as functionality, ergonomics, production technology, styling, as well as the service level and the ethical behaviour of a company are important. The six product phases are called: performance, optimisation, <b>itemisation,</b> segmentation, individualisation and awareness. In the original study, it was proposed that the product phases follow one after another. In a follow up study, it was concluded that the last three phases often exist simultaneously. In this paper, first the results of the follow up study are summarised. After that, the results will be presented of research into if and how master students of Industrial Design Engineering were able to use the theory to create starting points for new product development...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} accounting and taxation in antiquity. It draws upon complete translations of original documents from the New Kingdom (1552 – 1080 BC), ancient Egypt, to examine the accounting practices used in the various stages of the ‘cycle of taxation’, beginning with identifying taxable subjects, through the estimation and final assessment of taxes, to the collection, transportation and storage of taxes. The paper argues that these accounting practices were sufficiently fine-tuned for an ancient system of human accountability to function. Accounting practices used in these ancient documents embodied several key characteristics: designation of precise time and space, the identification of individuals responsible, and the naming, <b>itemisation,</b> enumeration, valuation and attribution of responsibility for different objects. Extrinsic relative valuations of different objects collected as tax in kind could be derived because the ancient scribes used a money of account system that allowed inter-translatability across different monies. This evidence points to {{the centrality of the}} role of accounting in the economy of ancient Egypt...|$|E
40|$|In England and Canada {{there is}} a ‘professional’ nuance to teachers’ employment. Jurisprudence in both {{countries}} suggests a deliberate expansion of what reasonable expectations education employers have of their teacher employees. Teachers’ claim to professional status forms the basis for this expansion of teachers’ duties. The function of this long-held interpretation constitutes a further step in the contractualisation of teachers’ work. A hallmark of reforms {{dating back to the}} 1970 s has been the increasing prescription of teachers work, a point which remains at odds with the claimed professional status. The age of the relevant cases hints that contractual flexibility has been a tool during times of reform. The result is that teachers’ employment contracts are understood as professional-level contracts, which means (to the courts) that not all duties must be spelled out in the contract. In fact, professional-level contracts cannot possibly include such an <b>itemisation.</b> Teachers are left with a series of lost decisions which reinforce not only their professional status (though in an unintended manner), but also unequivocally identify them as employees who are expected to follow all reasonable expectations of their education employers...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{industrial}} design engineering, research was until now concentrated on ergonomics, marketing, design methodology, etcetera. However, very {{little research has been}} undertaken studying the relationships between form giving and the following aspects: functionality, ergonomics, production and marketing. In this thesis, the phenomena that appear during the various phases of a product's life have been summarized. These phenomena apply amongst others to the market (is the product new to the market or are there a lot of competitors?), the functionality (is it possible to improve the functionality or has it reached a high degree of perfection?), and the ergonomics (has enough attention been paid to the product's ease of use, or is there scope for improvement?). The regularities that were found have been analysed and described. This has led to six product phases: performance, optimisation, <b>itemisation,</b> segmentation, individualisation, and awareness. The six phases are placed in a chronological order such that predictions about new or future products can be made. This can be done by positioning a product, based on its product characteristics, into one of the product phases. When developing a future product, a designer can add to the product characteristics of the next product phase, thus creating added value for the intended user. In this way, the product phases can help a designer in creating the next generation of a product. Industrial Design Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the possibility, form and key {{features of a}} jurisprudence or theory of law based on the philosophy of Theodor W. Adorno. The theory of law I propose draws on Adorno's critique of the thoroughgoing abstraction of contemporary society, which considers existence {{only in terms of}} universal concepts. I contend that the field of law provides a paradigmatic example of the operation of identity-thinking. In making this argument I draw on the jurisprudential theories of Ronald Dworkin, Roberto Mangabeira Unger and Alan Norrie in particular. I also draw on the work of J. M. Bernstein in proposing an brand of normative ethics based on Adorno's philosophy. I argue that the space between law's abstract <b>itemisation</b> of situations and subjects over which it passes judgment and the full, non-identical particularity of those situations and subjects forms a gap between the operation of law and the possibility of justice. By training its gaze to the gap itself and maintaining a self-reflective attitude towards its own distorting effects, I argue that an "Adornian" jurisprudence can more successfully avoid doing "violence" to the world it seeks to adjudicate. In particular, this jurisprudence would need to negotiate the space between the law's current reliance on universal ethical principles and a more substantial engagement with the situation presented for judgment, so as to ask how such a situation might give rise to its own, particular ethical response...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: General {{recommendations}} for a reference case for economic studies in rheumatic diseases {{were published in}} 2002 in an initiative to improve the comparability of cost-effectiveness studies in the field. Since then, economic evaluations in osteoarthritis (OA) continue to show considerable heterogeneity in methodological approach. OBJECTIVES: To develop a reference case specific for economic studies in OA, including the standard optimal care, with which to judge new pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions. METHODS: Four subgroups of an ESCEO expert working group on economic assessments (13 experts representing diverse aspects of clinical research and/or economic evaluations) were charged with producing lists of recommendations that would potentially improve the comparability of economic analyses in OA: outcome measures, comparators, costs and methodology. These proposals were discussed and refined during a face-to-face meeting in 2013. They are presented here in {{the format of the}} recommendations of the recently published Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement, so that an initiative on economic analysis methodology might be consolidated with an initiative on reporting standards. RESULTS: Overall, three distinct reference cases are proposed, one for each hand, knee and hip OA; with diagnostic variations in the first two, giving rise to different treatment options: interphalangeal or thumb-based disease for hand OA and {{the presence or absence of}} joint malalignment for knee OA. A set of management strategies is proposed, which should be further evaluated to help establish a consensus on the "standard optimal care" in each proposed reference case. The recommendations on outcome measures, cost <b>itemisation</b> and methodological approaches are also provided. CONCLUSIONS: The ESCEO group proposes a set of disease-specific recommendations on the conduct and reporting of economic evaluations in OA that could help the standardisation and comparability of studies that evaluate therapeutic strategies of OA in terms of costs and effectiveness.
