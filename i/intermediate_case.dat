5|$|In a liquid, powder or {{amorphous}} sample, molecules {{within that}} sample are in random orientations. Such samples have a continuous Fourier spectrum that uniformly spreads its amplitude {{thereby reducing the}} measured signal intensity, as is observed in SAXS. More importantly, the orientational information is lost. Although theoretically possible, it is experimentally difficult to obtain atomic-resolution structures of complicated, asymmetric molecules from such rotationally averaged data.

25|$|Solids with purely {{metallic}} bonding are characteristically ductile and, {{in their}} pure forms, have low strength; melting points {{can be very}} low (e.g., Mercury melts at 234K (−39°C). These properties are consequences of the non-directional and non-polar nature of metallic bonding, which allows atoms (and planes of atoms in a crystal lattice) to move past one another without disrupting their bonding interactions. Metals can be strengthened by introducing crystal defects (for example, by alloying) that interfere with the motion of dislocations that mediate plastic deformation. Further, some transition metals exhibit directional bonding in addition to metallic bonding; this increases shear strength and reduces ductility, imparting some {{of the characteristics of}} a covalent solid (an <b>intermediate</b> <b>case</b> below).|$|E
60|$|An <b>intermediate</b> <b>case</b> {{is that of}} a name used analogically or metaphorically; that is, a name {{which is}} {{predicated}} of two things, not univocally, or exactly in the same signification, but in significations somewhat similar, and which being derived one from the other, one of them may be considered the primary, and the other a secondary signification. As when we speak of a brilliant light and a brilliant achievement. The word is not applied in the same sense to the light and to the achievement; but having been applied to the light in its original sense, that of brightness to the eye, it is transferred to the achievement in a derivative signification, supposed to be somewhat like the primitive one. The word, however, is just as properly two names instead of one, in this case, as in that of the most perfect ambiguity. And one of the commonest forms of fallacious reasoning arising from ambiguity, {{is that of a}}rguing from a metaphorical expression as if it were literal; that is, as if a word, when applied metaphorically, were the same name as when taken in its original sense: which will be seen more particularly in its place.|$|E

The choice of studying PEV charging in cases with no control, full control, and with a two-hour window of flexibility is meant to represent two extreme and one <b>intermediate</b> <b>cases.</b> One could study other <b>intermediate</b> <b>cases</b> (i.e., with {{half an hour of}} charging control).

Parabolic orbits do not occur in nature; simple orbits most commonly resemble hyperbolas or ellipses. The parabolic orbit is the degenerate <b>intermediate</b> <b>case</b> between those two types of ideal orbit. An object following a parabolic orbit would travel at the exact escape velocity of the object it orbits; objects in elliptical or hyperbolic orbits travel at less or greater than escape velocity, respectively.
