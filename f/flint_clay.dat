2500|$|There {{are many}} Mississippian town sites in Kentucky, {{such as the}} Adams, Backusburg, Canton, Chambers, Jonathan Creek, McLeod's Bluff, Rowlandtown, Sassafras Ridge, Turk, Twin Mounds, and Wickliffe sites. The Wickliffe Mounds in far western Kentucky were {{inhabited}} from 1000-1350 CE. There were two large platform mounds and eight smaller mounds scattered around a central plaza. They traded with North Carolina, Wisconsin, and the Gulf of Mexico societies. The community of Wickliffe had a social hierarchy ruled by a hereditary chief. The Rowlandton Mound Site was inhabited from 1100 to 1350CE. The Rowlandton Mound site sat on a [...] site, which also a large platform mound and an associated village area, similar to the Wickliffe Mounds Site. It is probable that these civic sites were established originally by local Late Woodland peoples. The Tolu Site was inhabited by Kentucky natives from 1200–1450 CE. The Tolu site originally had three mounds: a burial mound, a substructure platform mound, and one other of undetermined function. It also had a central plaza, and a large [...] thick midden area. A rare Cahokia-made Missouri <b>flint</b> <b>clay</b> [...] human effigy pipe was found as this site. The Marshall Site was inhabited from 900 to 1300CE; The Turk Site was inhabited from 1100 – 1500CE; and the Adams Site was peopled from 1100 to 1500CE. The Slack Farm was populated from 1400-1650AD. This had a Native American mound, and extensive village occupation. As many as a thousand or more people could have been buried at the seven cemeteries at the site. Some were buried in stone box graves. Native Americans abandoned a large late Mississippian village in Petersburg that contained [...] "at least two periods of habitation dating to 1150 A.D. and 1400 A.D."

40|$|Abstract-The term "flint clay " used in USA {{and several}} other countries, {{corresponds}} very closely to the term "toasted bread (sukhar) clay". In both USA and U. S. S. R., the typical occurences of"toasted clays " are confined to deposits of the lower Carboniferous. In their properties and occurrence the well-studied toasted clays of the Borovichy deposit (Novgorod province) are highly similar to the <b>flint</b> <b>clays</b> of Missouri, differing significantly only in having lower bulk specific gravity and higher porosity than do Missouri <b>flint</b> <b>clays.</b> Varieties with excess free alumina (diaspore, boehmite) are observed both among "toasted " and <b>flint</b> <b>clays.</b> The author suggests he term "toasted complex " (sukharnii kompleks) which corresponds toW. D. Keller's term "flint clay facies". The clays of the "toasted complex " are sediments of ancient swamps and lakes which contained rich vegetation. Their source material was finaly dispersed silicate particles transported from dry land.

40|$|Abstract [...] Bulk (lump) {{densities of}} 31 kaolins were {{measured}} on the clay {{in the natural}} or raw state after drying at 100 ~ and after firing to 1510 ~ (2700 ~ The kaolins were selected from such diverse origins as surface-weathered and sedimentary accumulations, hydrothermally altered bodies and flint-clay deposits. The sedimentary group ranged in density from 0. 82 to 1 - 85 in the dried raw clay, and 1. 93 to 2 - 63 when fired.

40|$|In the {{vicinity}} of Burning Mountain, New South Wales, an unusually thick sequence of ka-olinite clayrocks (<b>flint</b> <b>clays)</b> has been considerably altered by heat from the natural com-bustion of coal seams.

Below the seams, however, the temperatures were considerably lower and metakaolin resulted. Much of the metakaolin has subsequently been rehydroxylated by groundwater to yield halloysite (l 0 A) and this reaction is continuing at the present time. To determine the reason for development of halloysite (l 0 A) instead of kaolinite as the rehy-droxylated product, a study has been undertaken of the various intermediate phases in the reaction 5 "qo"o". ordered kaolinite + metakaolin-+ halloysite 1 t 0 A).

40|$|Abstract [...] Organic a ids in the 0 - 01 M {{concentration}} range representing amino-, aliphatic, and aro-matic types present in humus dissolve 70 - 85 ppm A 1 from Arkansas bauxite at room temperature, whereas 0 - 03 ppm is dissolved in water. The species of A 1 in aqueous solution, calculated from stability data, range from A 13 + at pH 3 and lower, through AI 2 (OH) 24 + at a maximum concentration at pH 4. 5, AI(OH) 2 + at a maximum at pH 4. 7, AI(OH) 2 + at a maximum at pH 6. 0, to AI(OH) 4 - at pH 8. 5 and higher. In salicylic acid an Al-Sal + complex occurs between pH 1 " 5 and 8. 5, {{and is at}} a maximum at pH 4. 2. Solubility of A 1 obviously is pH dependent; {{also because of the}} vulnerability of organic acids to oxidation, the solubility and transport of A 1 is indirectly Eh dependent. Anions that combine with Al include OH- to form bauxite, PO 43 - to form lateritic phosphate such as the Bone Valley Formation, Fla., and SiO 4 4 - to form allophane or kaolin as noted in the kaolin synthesis by Linares and Huartes. Spongelike, pisolitic or oolitic structures, and mineral veins in bauxites, lateritic phos-phates, and some <b>flint</b> <b>clays</b> attest o mobilization of Al in solution.

50|$|This {{style of}} {{statuary}} is found at Cahokian sites in western Illinois and eastern Missouri, at Spiro and other Caddoan Mississippian sites in eastern Oklahoma and northwestern Louisiana, {{and various other}} sites throughout the American southeast. For many years the statues were {{thought to have been}} produced locally at the sites in which they were discovered, but recent scientific analysis (X-ray diffraction, sequential acid dissolution, and inductively coupled plasma analyses) has shown all of the statues to have been produced from a <b>flint</b> <b>clay</b> only found in the vicinity of St. Louis, Missouri. The particular pipestone used by the artists of Cahokia has a distinctive combination of a lithium bearing chlorite, abundant boehmite (an aluminium oxyhydroxide) and a heavy-metal phosphate mineral suite.

40|$|A {{detailed}} sedimentological and mineralogical {{study has}} been undertaken of the Early Permian Koogah Formation which is located {{a little to the}} northeast of Wingen in the Hunter Valley, NSW, with the principal objective being {{a better understanding of the}} conditions responsible for development of this unusual and indeed possibly unique sedimentary unit. From the outset it was realised that the formation comprises two distinctive and to some extent contrasting facies: (a) that forming the lower part, consisting essentially of kaolinite clayrocks or <b>flint</b> <b>clays</b> up to 75 metres thick; and (b) that constituting the upper section, composed almost entirely of quartz-lithic sandstones and conglomerates. Nevertheless coal seams that are generally lenticular and non-commercial are common to both facies. The Lower Koogah Formation is underlain by the Werrie Basalts, a two kilometre thick lava pile composed of fractionated alkaline basalt flows. The topmost flows are altered due to chemical weathering and several alteration profiles exist. Analysis of vertical sequences within the Lower Koogah Formation enabled four lithofacies to be distinguished: Sub-unit I consists of massive kaolinite clayrock with relict volcanic textures and is a palaeosaprolite: Sub-unit II is composed of xenoclasts, aggregates and particles of kaolinite and, in places, kaolinite clasts containing gibbsite and boehmite, all of which are derived from Sub-unit I and the lithofacies is interpreted as proximal mudflow breccias: Sub-unit III contains siliceous pebbles of incongruent roundness and is interpreted as proximal debris-flow conglomerates: Sub-unit IV is a varied stack of kaolinite clayrock beds with sedimentary structures and interbands of coals, red-beds and ironstones and interpreted as the mid-to distal-fan accumulations of alluvial fans. Local lakes, interlobe swamps and vegetation colonies occupied the surface of the fans. The Upper Koogah Formation consists of conglomerates, sandstones, siltstones, shales and coals with minor interbeds of kaolinite clayrocks and are typical coal measures deposited in a floodplain setting. The body of evidence favours an allochthonous origin for the bulk of the kaolinite clayrocks in the Koogah Formation...|$|R
