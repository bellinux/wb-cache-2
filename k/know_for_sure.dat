5|$|Using Mulder's credentials, Roche kidnaps {{a girl in}} Swampscott, Massachusetts whom he met on {{his flight}} with Mulder to Boston. Scully and Skinner arrive {{the next day and}} the agents head to the site of Roche's old {{apartment}} in Revere. They find him with the girl in an abandoned bus nearby. Roche holds the gun on the girl and tells Mulder that he'll never <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure</b> whether the last victim is Samantha or not if he kills him. Mulder is then forced to shoot Roche, as he starts to pull on the trigger of the stolen gun. In his office Mulder stares at the final cloth heart and puts it away, unsure of whether it belonged to Samantha or not.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure.</b> Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E

NBC reported losing $500,000 in advertising revenue. Speaking of this loss, then-NBC president Warren Littlefield said, at odds with NBC's earlier denial of possible revenue loss being a factor in its scheduling decision, [...] "There are few things in broadcasting that we <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>sure,</b> {{and one of those}} is that when you do an episode of any series that deals with AIDS, {{there is going to be}} advertiser sensitivity to it.
