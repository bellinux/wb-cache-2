40|$|While earlier {{empirical}} studies found a negative saving effect of old-age <b>dependency</b> <b>rates</b> without considering longevity, {{recent studies have}} found that longevity has a positive effect on growth without considering old-age <b>dependency</b> <b>rates.</b> In this paper, we first justify the related yet independent roles of longevity and old-age <b>dependency</b> <b>rates</b> in determining saving and growth by using a growth model that encompasses both neoclassical and endogenous growth models as special cases. Using panel data from a recent World Bank data set, we then find that the longevity effect is positive and the dependency effect is negative in savings and investment regressions. The estimates indicate that the differences in the demographic variables across countries or over time can well explain the differences in aggregate savings rates. We also find that both population age structure and life expectancy are important contributing factors to growth. (C) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Projections of the {{dependent}} elderly population (65 + years old) have been made for Belgium as a whole, by age, sex, and composition of the household, for the period 2005 - 2050, {{taking into account the}} differences in prevalence <b>rates</b> of <b>dependency</b> by household type and possible future declines in these rates. Population projections are made by the Belgian national statistical institute (INS-NIS). The distribution of the population by five-year age groups and sex according to the composition of the household is taken from the Belgian population register. Only three categories are considered: single person private households, other private households, collective households. The latter category has been corrected using the national health insurance data (INAMI-RIZIV). In the absence of adequate data for Belgium, data on the elderly <b>dependency</b> <b>rates</b> by age, sex, and type of household are those of the French HID (Handicap-Invalidité-Dépendance) survey.

30|$|For {{the period}} between 2007 and 2013, {{coefficients}} for the real per capita budgetary deficits, economy, and <b>dependency</b> <b>rate</b> of the aged are all significant at the 1 % significance level. The coefficient for real per capita budgetary deficits is 0.042, meaning that increasing 1000 yuan for real per capita budgetary deficits would lead to 42 yuan more real per capita GHE. The coefficient for economy is 125. This indicates that increasing one unit of economy would contribute to 125 yuan more real per capita GHE. The coefficient for the <b>dependency</b> <b>rate</b> of the aged is 770, which suggests that an increase of one percentage point of the <b>dependency</b> <b>rate</b> of the aged is associated with 8 yuan more real per capita GHE. Compared to {{the model for the}} years between 2007 and 2013, the corresponding model for {{the period between}} 2009 and 2013 yielded similar results. Still, the coefficients for the real per capita budgetary deficits, economy, and <b>dependency</b> <b>rate</b> of the aged are the three variables that are significant, the difference being that the coefficient for economy is no longer significant at the 1 % significance level but instead at the 5 % significance level. The coefficient for real per capita budgetary deficits dropped from 0.042 to 0.031, indicating that the influence of budgetary deficits has decreased since 2009. On the other hand, the magnitude of the coefficients for the economy and <b>dependency</b> <b>rate</b> of the aged both improved. A one-unit increase of economy would this time lead to 145 yuan more real per capita GHE, and increasing one percentage point of the <b>dependency</b> <b>rate</b> of the aged would mean 9 yuan more real per capita GHE.|$|E

40|$|The Portuguese Pension System is {{submitted}} to two risks. Over the period 2005 - 2050, {{a decrease of}} the workforce and an increase of old-age persons are eminent, which provide a doubling of the <b>dependency</b> <b>rate.</b> So, {{the system is not}} financially sustainable in the medium and long terms and it is expected that the system will enter in a growing deficit in 2015, when expenditures will overcome the revenues. Hence, the system is subject to a demographic risk (associated with the reduction of the fertility rates, the augmentation of the life expectancy and the increase of the <b>dependency</b> <b>rate)</b> and to a financial insolvency risk (motivated by the lack of equatorial correspondence between expenditures and revenues). Immigration could be a solution to the unsustainability of the pension systems. This paper examines the role of the immigration on resolving these two risks. We investigate, based on the European Economy (2006) projections about the impact of ageing on the public expenditure for the period 2005 - 50, the required immigrant flows that maintain the old-age <b>dependency</b> <b>rate</b> observed in 2004, and we calculate also the number of immigrants required to promote a null financial result for the Portuguese Pension System. We conclude that the number of immigrants that guarantees a null financial result is much lower than one that eliminates the demographic risk. Compared with the European Economy forecasts (2006), the number of immigrants required to guarantee the solvency of the Portuguese pension system is substantially higher and show an upward trend during the period under review contrary to the expected trend announced by that European entity.

40|$|Circadian {{variations}} of the QT interval and its heart <b>rate</b> <b>dependency</b> have been established. However, the respective roles of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems in their regulation are still undetermined. Eighteen healthy volunteers (average age 39 +/- 7 years, 10 men) were recruited and selected randomly to receive either placebo or atenolol (100 mg/day). The treatments were crossed after 7 days. The <b>rate</b> <b>dependency</b> of the QT was assessed by day and by night by 24 hour Holter ECG monitoring. The effects of atenolol on the <b>rate</b> <b>dependency</b> of the QT interval depend {{on the time of}} day.

Numerical dynamic uniaxial tensile tests on the sandstone are performed using both X-ray micro CT based and homogenous particle models. The results indicate that there is an only negligible strength increase with increasing strain rate for the homogenous particle model. However, a significant strength increase is observed with increasing strain rate for the X-ray micro CT based particle model. Therefore, it must be the microstructure that causes a strain <b>rate</b> <b>dependency.</b> Moreover, the influence of viscosity and <b>rate</b> <b>dependency</b> of springs are also studied.

40|$|Background: Previous {{reports have}} shown {{inconsistent}} results on clinical outcomes {{between women and}} men after stroke, and little is known about gender differences on outcomes in Chinese post-stroke patients. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore whether there were gender differences on clinical characteristics and outcomes in Chinese patients after ischemic stroke by using the data from the China National Stroke Registry (CNSR). Methods and Findings: Out of 12, 415 consecutively recruited patients with acute ischemic stroke in the CNSR from 2007 to 2008, 11, 560 (93. 1 %) patients were followed up for 12 months. Their clinical characteristics and outcomes on death, recurrence, and dependency were recorded. The multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine whether there were gender differences in these outcomes. Women were older than men at baseline (67. 9 vs. 64. 0 years, P, 0. 001). Women had a higher mortality, recurrence rate, and <b>dependency</b> <b>rate</b> at 3, 6, and 12 months than men, but after adjusting for age, history of diabetes, pre-stroke dependency, stroke severity, in-hospital complications, and other confounders, there were no statistically significant differences in gender on mortality and recurrence rate at 3, 6, and 12 months; and <b>dependency</b> <b>rate</b> at 3, and 6 months. However, the <b>dependency</b> <b>rate</b> at 12 months remained significantly higher in women (odds ratio, 1. 24; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 06 to 1. 45).

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the BGIA (Belgian Gender and Income Analysis) project, a methodology was developed to compute the individual income of women and men in order to illustrate existing gender differences, also in terms of financial dependency. This paper presents the gender distribution of individual income and financial dependency in nine European countries :Austria, Belgium, Spain, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom. First, the data and methodology are explained. In a second step, we analyse the difference between the individual income and financial <b>dependency</b> <b>rates</b> of women and men as well as those individual characteristics that determine the gender gap. We also compare our individually-based financial <b>dependency</b> <b>rates</b> with the household-based at-risk-of-poverty rates as they are defined by the European Commission. In the third part of this paper, the analysis is topped off by the estimation of an econometric model of the probit type to identify those factors with the most decisive influence on the probability of being financially dependent. The pure marginal effects of all individual characteristics separately are computed by this method. In the fourth part, four new indicators are suggested to complete the core set of poverty and social exclusion indicators which are regularly produced for every EU country on a comparable basis (the so-called 'Laeken Indicators'). info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

30|$|The {{indicator}} of the unemployment rate, although capturing {{some aspects of the}} economy, was excluded from the factor analysis due to its high uniqueness. It was added back to the regression to serve as a control variable due to its potential correlation with GHE (because unemployed people usually have a greater demand for health care services and are in particular need of government support). Among the three population characteristics identified at the beginning, the percentage of the urban population, the adolescent <b>dependency</b> <b>rate,</b> and the <b>dependency</b> <b>rate</b> of the aged, only the last was entered into the regression because the first two were found to be strongly correlated with economy. This is intuitive because more urbanized areas tend to have higher levels of economic development, and it is much more expensive to raise children in these areas, therefore lowering the number of children. In total, four indicators plus two control variables were included in the regression analyses.|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objectives}} : Nowadays, technological development has made human beings life so complicated {{and makes his}} life prone to dangers like being disabled, unemployment or even death. In order to reduce these hazardous effects on human life, insurance has shown its effectiveness and acceptance in most countries around the world. Following survey aimed to study the life insurance demand function and its most effective factors (like annual income, inflation rate, <b>dependency</b> <b>rate,</b> education, and probability of head of household’s death) and their demand elastic ties. Material and Methods : In this study, time series have been used and by deployment of OLS, each and every effective factor on life insurance demand has been studied; so the demand elasticity on each factor has been calculated. Results : The survey findings showed that except education, {{the rest of the}} data were in the 5 % level integrated from the degree one and there was no co-integration between them.   After running the model on data, it illuminated that the income elasticity of life insurance demand was 0. 112 and the demand elasticity of life insurance to the probability of head of household’s death, <b>dependency</b> <b>rate,</b> education and inflation rate were 0. 221, 2. 24, 0. 211 and - 1. 33 respectively.
