5|$|The main {{oxidizer}} {{and main}} fuel valves control {{the flow of}} liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen into the engine and are controlled by each <b>engine</b> <b>controller.</b> When an engine is operating, the main valves are fully open.|$|E
5|$|A coolant {{control valve}} {{is mounted on}} the {{combustion}} chamber coolant bypass duct of each engine. The <b>engine</b> <b>controller</b> regulates the amount of gaseous hydrogen allowed to bypass the nozzle coolant loop, thus controlling its temperature. The chamber coolant valve is 100% open before engine start. During engine operation, it is 100% open for throttle settings of 100 to 109% for maximum cooling. For throttle settings between 65 and 100%, its position ranged from 66.4 to 100% open for reduced cooling.|$|E
5|$|A test {{series was}} planned to {{determine}} RS-25 engine performance with: the new <b>engine</b> <b>controller</b> unit; lower liquid oxygen temperatures; greater inlet pressure {{due to the}} taller SLS core stage liquid oxygen tank and higher vehicle acceleration; and, more nozzle heating due to the four-engine configuration and its position in-plane with the SLS booster exhaust nozzles. New ablative insulation and heaters were to be tested during the series.|$|E

5|$|Most {{variants}} of the CFM56 feature a single-annular combustor. An annular combustor is a continuous ring where fuel is {{injected into the}} airflow and ignited, raising the pressure and temperature of the flow. Other types of combustors include can combustors, where each combustion chamber is separate, and canannular which is a hybrid of the two. Fuel injection is regulated by a Hydromechanical Unit (HMU), built by Honeywell. The HMU regulates the amount of fuel delivered to the engine {{by means of an}} electrohydraulic servo valve that, in turn, drives a fuel metering valve, that provides information to the full authority digital <b>engine</b> <b>controller</b> (FADEC).|$|E
5|$|The CFM56-4 {{series was}} a {{proposed}} improved {{version of the}} CFM56-2 designed for the Airbus A320 family of aircraft. Competing with the RJ500 engine being developed by Rolls-Royce, the -4 series was designed to produce 25,000lbf (110kN) and was to feature a new 68in (1.73m) fan, a new low-pressure compressor and a full authority digital <b>engine</b> <b>controller</b> (FADEC). Soon after the upgrade project was launched in 1984, International Aero Engines offered their new V2500 engine for the A320. CFMI realized that the CFM56-4 did not compare favorably with the new engine and scrapped the project to begin working on the CFM56-5 series.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} the HPOTP and HPFTP {{turbines}} depends on {{the position of the}} corresponding oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves. These valves are positioned by the <b>engine</b> <b>controller,</b> which uses them to throttle the flow of liquid oxygen to the preburners and, thus, control engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer valves increase or decrease the liquid oxygen flow, thus increasing or decreasing preburner chamber pressure, HPOTP and HPFTP turbine speed, and liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen flow into the main combustion chamber, which increases or decreases engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner valves operate together to throttle the engine and maintain a constant 6.03:1 propellant mixture ratio.|$|E

5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{equipped}} with a main <b>engine</b> <b>controller</b> (MEC), an integrated computer which controls all of the engine's functions (through the use of valves) and monitors its performance. Built by Honeywell Aerospace, each MEC originally comprised two redundant Honeywell HDC-601 computers, later upgraded to a system composed of two doubly redundant Motorola 68000 (M68000) processors (for a total of four M68000s per controller). Having the controller installed on the engine itself greatly simplifies the wiring between the engine and the launch vehicle, because all the sensors and actuators are connected directly to only the controller, each MEC then being connected to the orbiter's general purpose computers (GPCs) or the SLS's avionics suite via its own engine interface unit (EIU). Using a dedicated system also simplifies the software and thus improves its reliability.|$|E
5|$|The {{oxidizer}} {{and fuel}} preburners are welded to the hot-gas manifold. The fuel and oxidizer enter the preburners and are mixed so that efficient combustion can occur. The augmented spark igniter {{is a small}} combination chamber located {{in the center of}} the injector of each preburner. The two dual-redundant spark igniters, which are activated by the <b>engine</b> <b>controller,</b> are used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion in each preburner. They are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is then self-sustaining. The preburners produce the fuel-rich hot gases that pass through the turbines to generate the power needed to operate the high-pressure turbopumps. The oxidizer preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPOTP and to the oxidizer preburner pump. The fuel preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPFTP.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 November, while readying Discovery for launch, {{engineers}} {{reported an}} electrical {{issue on the}} backup Main <b>Engine</b> <b>Controller</b> (MEC) mounted on Engine No. 3 (SSME-3). Earlier in the morning, engineers said that the problem had been solved, however another glitch in the system raised concerns and additional troubleshooting was ordered. Troubleshooting followed and indicated the problem was related to [...] "transient contamination" [...] in a circuit breaker. NASA Test Director Steve Payne, addressing reporters, told that after troubleshooting and power cycles, the controller powered up normally. However, {{at the same time}} the problem was thought to be a non-issue, an unexpected voltage drop was observed.|$|E

40|$|Current {{aircraft}} <b>engine</b> <b>controllers</b> {{are designed}} and operated to provide desired performance and stability margins. Except {{for the hard}} limits for extreme conditions, <b>engine</b> <b>controllers</b> do not usually take engine component life into consideration during the controller design and operation. The end result is that aircraft pilots regularly operate engines under unnecessarily harsh conditions to strive for optimum performance. The NASA Glenn Research Center and its industrial and academic partners have been working together toward an intelligent control concept that will include engine life {{as part of the}} controller design criteria. This research includes the study of the relationship between control action and engine component life as well as the design of an intelligent control algorithm to provide proper tradeoffs between performance and engine life. This approach is expected to maintain operating safety while minimizing overall operating costs. In this study, the thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) of a critical component was selected to demonstrate how an intelligent engine control algorithm can significantly extend engine life with only a very small sacrifice in performance. An intelligent engine control scheme based on modifying the high-pressure spool speed (NH) was proposed to reduce TMF damage from ground idle to takeoff. The NH acceleration schedule was optimized to minimize the TMF damage for a given rise-time constraint, which represents the performance requirement. The intelligent engine control scheme was used to simulate a commercial short-haul aircraft engine...|$|R
50|$|Whereas {{most members}} of the Trent family are {{controlled}} by Goodrich FADECs, <b>engine</b> <b>controllers</b> on the Trent 900 are provided by Hamilton Sundstrand, a United Technologies (UTC) company. UTC is also the parent company of Pratt & Whitney, who, with GE Aircraft Engines, is partnering to produce the Engine Alliance GP7000, the other engine available for the A380.
