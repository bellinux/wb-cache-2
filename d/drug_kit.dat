Principal use is with the BACTEC 460 TB instrument. BACTEC S. I. R. E. Drugs (Streptomycin, Isoniazid, Rifampin and Ethambutol) are recommended as additives to BACTEC 12 B Culture Medium for the qualitative susceptibility testing of M. tuberculosis from culture. SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION The BACTEC procedure for drug susceptibility testing of mycobacteria {{is based on the}} same basic principle employed in the conventional method except that a liquid medium is used and instead of counting colonies after about 3 weeks, the growth is monitored radiometrically and the results are reportable within 4 to 12 days. BACTEC drug susceptibility is determined by following {{a modified version of the}} conventional proportion method. 1 The critical proportion for resistance is taken as 1 % for all antituberculosis drugs. This means that if 1 % or more of the test mycobacterial population is resistant, the culture is considered resistant for laboratory reporting purposes. Resistance is determined by comparing the rate of growth in the control vial and the 12 B Medium vials containing the test drug...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Medical {{emergencies}} {{can occur}} frequently in dental setting. Effective management {{of an emergency}} situation in the dental office is ultimately the dentist's responsibility. The lack of training and inability to cope with medical emergencies can lead to tragic consequences and sometimes legal action. For this reason, all health professionals including dentists must be well prepared to attend to medical emergencies. Providing basic life support [BLS] is dentist's most important contribution until definitive treatment for a medical emergency can be given. Hence the study is aimed to assess the dental graduates (Interns) knowledge, skills and competency regarding dentistry-medical emergency interface. Methodology: Data were collected from 105 Interns of two dental colleges of Belgaum City using a structured questionnaire consisting of 7 item questionnaire (6 closed and 1 open ended). Results: Overall in all the years, syncope / faint was seen by 40. 9 % of the respondents, 37. 1 % with hypoglycemic attacks, allergic reactions by 17. 1 %, epileptic attacks by 7. 6 %, asthmatic attacks by 4. 5 % and angina 0. 9 %. The frequencies of the emergencies encountered were once or even more. Knowledge {{of the presence of}} drugs and equipments in the emergency <b>drug</b> <b>kit</b> and the confidence in regard to use them was low. Medical emergencies training were undertaken by 42 % respondents, but in varying degrees. There was a desire for further medical emergencies training by majority of respondents. Conclusion: The study showed that syncope is the commonest medical emergency event. Dental graduates had a superficial knowledge of medical emergencies, drugs and equipments. Emphasis is placed on the need for more medical emergencies training to be offered, to increase knowledge and confidence of dental graduates (Interns) in the management of medical emergencie...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an assessment of}} the technical competence and ethical behaviour of Community-based Animal Health Workers (CAHWs) in Mwingi District, Kenya. From 99 trained CAHWs, 40 participated in the study. Using a pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire, direct observation of the relevant veterinary <b>drug</b> <b>kits</b> and participatory discussions, the study team found that the CAHWs knowledge of clinical signs of local livestock diseases and notifiable and zoonotic diseases and their ability to use veterinary drugs correctly and safely were adequate. Marks were awarded to the candidates according to an agreed marking scheme between the CAHWs’ trainers and study team members. The results showed that, overall, 36 out of 40 (90 %) of the sampled CAHWs passed the tests. The existence of a referral system for CAHWs and refresher trainings helped to ensure that CAHW competence and ethical behaviour were maintained. However, it was also found that some areas of the current curriculum required more detailed input based on field experience. The CAHW system could serve as an alternative animal health care system in areas lacking veterinary services. Peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Date of Acceptance: 05 / 12 / 2013 Context: Throughout the UK a {{large amount}} of unwanted, expired or patient {{returned}} controlled drugs are disposed of every day, in community and hospital pharmacies, veterinary surgeries, hospices, private hospitals and industrial settings. This is mostly achieved through the use of commercially available controlled <b>drug</b> destruction/denaturing <b>kits,</b> but what do these kits actually do to the drug within them? Objective: The primary aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of six commercially available kits on morphine, a chosen model controlled drug. The secondary aim was to establish if the kits could be adapted to chemically destroy any drug disposed within it. Materials and methods: Morphine was dispensed in to six commercially available controlled <b>drug</b> destruction <b>kits</b> at a known concentration. The instructions on the kits were followed and after 48 h the amount of drug remaining was determined by HPLC. In addition a new kit containing sodium perborate was tested in the same way. Results: Between 78 and 111 % of the parent drug was found to still be present in the commercial kits tested after 48 h. In the sodium perborate 5 % kit this level fell to 22 %. Discussion and conclusions: In conclusion all the commercially available CD denaturing kits tested do not destroy the controlled drug (morphine) tested but simply encapsulated it in gel. This means the parent form of the drug is still present and could potentially be recovered and abused. The new kit containing sodium perborate was much more effective in chemically destroying the parent drug but care must be taken in its use...|$|R

40|$|Zinc for the {{treatment}} of childhood diarrhoea was introduced in a pilot area in southern Mali to prepare for a cluster-randomized effectiveness study and to inform policies on how to best introduce and promote zinc at the community level. Dispersible zinc tablets in 14 -tablet blister packs were provided through community health centres and <b>drug</b> <b>kits</b> managed by community health workers (CHWs) in two health zones in Bougouni district, Mali. Village meetings and individual counselling provided by CHWs and head nurses at health centres were the principal channels of communication. A combination of methods were employed to (a) detect problems in communication about the benefits of zinc and its mode of administration; (b) identify and resolve obstacles to implementation of zinc through existing health services; and (c) describe household-level constraints to the adoption of appropriate home-management practices for diarrhoea, including administration of both zinc and oral rehydration solution (ORS). Population-based household surveys with caretakers of children sick in the previous two weeks were carried out before and four months after the introduction of zinc supplementation. Household follow-up visits with children receiving zinc from the health centres and CHWs were conducted on day 3 and 14 after treatment for a subsample of children. A qualitative process evaluation also was conducted to investigate operational issues. Preliminary evidence from this study suggests that the introduction of zinc does not reduce the use of ORS and may reduce inappropriate antibiotic use for childhood diarrhoea. Financial access to treatments, management of concurrent diarrhoea and fever, and high use of unauthorized drug vendors were identified as factors affecting the effectiveness of the intervention in this setting. The introduction of zinc, if not appropriately integrated with other disease-control strategies, has the potential to decrease the appropriate presumptive treatment of childhood malaria in children with diarrhoea and fever in malaria-endemic areas...|$|R

However, urinalysis conducted by the Department of Defense has been challenged for reliability of testing the metabolite of cocaine. There are two associated metabolites of cocaine, benzoylecgonine (BZ) and ecgonine methyl ester (EME), the first (BZ) is created by the presence of cocaine in an aqeous solution with a pH greater than 7.0, while the second (EME) results from the actual human metabolic process. The presence of EME confirms actual ingestion of cocaine by a human being, while the presence of BZ is indicative only. BZ without EME is evidence of sample contamination, however, the US Department of Defense has chosen not to test for EME in its urinalysis program.|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) {{are driven by}} an abnormal receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, occurring mainly due to somatic mutations in KIT or platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA). Although the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has revolutionized therapy for GIST patients, with time the vast {{majority of}} them develop TKI resistance. Advances in understanding the molecular background of GIST resistance allows for the identification of new targets and the development of novel strategies to overcome or delay its occurrence. Areas covered: The focus of this review is on novel, promising therapeutic approaches to overcome heterogeneous resistance to registered TKIs. These approaches involve new TKIs, including drugs specific for a mutated form of KIT/PDGFRA, drugs with inhibitory effect against multiple RTKs, compounds targeting dysregulated downstream signaling pathways, <b>drugs</b> affecting <b>KIT</b> expression and degradation, inhibitors of cell cycle, and immunotherapeutics. Expert commentary: As the resistance to standard TKI treatment can be heterogeneous, a combinational approach for refractory GIST could be beneficial. Moreover, the understanding of the molecular background of resistant disease would allow development of a more personalized approach for these patients and their response to targeted therapy could be monitored closely using "liquid biopsy". status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The health {{sector has}} been {{undergoing}} far-reaching reforms since the mid- 1990 s and {{has adopted a}} Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp). The reforms are being implemented at all levels and involve fundamental changes in many critical areas of the sector. The complexity of the current reforms and the challenges ahead are quite immense. Thus, close monitoring and evaluation of the health sector’s performance overtime is quite imperative. To this effect, 26 indicators, (input, process, output and outcome), encompassing financial, human, utilisation and epidemiological data have been identified and selected. The Public Health Sector Performance Profile has been developed to provide a commentary {{on the performance of}} the public health sector utilising the identified indicators. It is expected to be produced on an annual basis and will fulfill two critical roles, i. e., a tool to track the health sector reform progress year-on-year and to provide critical information for the monitoring of the health sector Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) targets. The work on performance monitoring in the health sector comes at quite an opportune time in light of the PRSP and Poverty Monitoring. Efforts have been made to ensure that the work in the health sector is securely anchored to these critical processes. This first profile provides baseline data for most of the identified indicators, although issues over completeness and quality of data, particularly routine and denominator data, still remains an outstanding and critical obstacle in this challenging process. Moreover, as this is a very new an innovative initiative, there may be other groups working on relevant/critical data which has not yet been accessed by the profile. Consequently, it is hoped that this profile will act as a catalyst and encourage such groups to come forward and to contribute to the next profile in 2002. Altogether, there are 26 Health Sector performance indicators, including those indicators which the health sector is expected to report on for the PRSP. There are 7 input indicators covering financial and human resources at the national, regional and district level. Process indicators consist of four in total, including the utilisation of HMIS/NSS data at the district level, proportion of public health facilities in a good state of repair, percentage of public health facilities without any stock outs and availability of <b>drug</b> <b>kits</b> in public health facilities. There are six output indicators encompassing cost sharing, OPD attendance, proportion of births attended by skilled attendants’, immunisation, malaria and consumer satisfaction. Finally, there are nine outcome indicators and these cover a number of aspects, including, maternal death, malnutrition, malaria and HIV/AIDS. Each indicator is presented under the following headings: relevance, sources of data, data quality, baseline data, discussion and future development of the indicator. ...|$|R

40|$|Throughout most of {{the past}} century, {{physicians}} could offer patients no treatments for infections caused by viruses. The experience with treatment of infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has changed the way healthcare workers deal with viral infections and has triggered a growing rate of discovery and use of antiviral agents, the first fruits of the expanding genomics revolution. HIV treatment also provides an informative paradigm for pharmacogenomics because control of infection and its consequences is limited by the development of viral drug resistance and by host factors. This report summarizes studies published to date on the significance of testing of HIV- 1 resistance to antiretroviral drugs. The only Food and <b>Drug</b> Administration-approved <b>kit</b> for HIV <b>drug</b> resistance testing by genotypic sequencing is commercially available through Visible Genetics, Inc. Genotyping sequencing alone is most likely an adequate test to assist in the therapeutic decision-making process for previous regimen failure, for treatment-naive patients in areas of high prevalence of transmitted resistant virus, and for pregnant women. However, in exceptional cases of highly complex mutation patterns and extensive cross-resistance, it may be useful to obtain a phenotype test, because that result may more easily identify drugs to which virus is least resistant. There are no published clinical trials results on the usefulness of the so-called virtual phenotype over genotypic sequencing alone. Not only has the paradigm of viral pharmacogenomics in the form of HIV genotypic sequencing been useful in treating other viral diseases, but {{it is also important to}} the real-life implementation of the growing discipline of genomics or molecular medicine. The application of this paradigm to the thousands of potential therapeutic targets that have become available through the various human genome projects will certainly gradually change the landscape of diagnosis and management of many diseases, including cancer...|$|R

The mutational outcomes predicted in silico {{were correlated with}} in vitro and in vivo activation rates and <b>drug</b> sensitivities of <b>KIT</b> mutants. The allosteric regulation of KIT in the native and mutated forms is {{described in terms of}} communication between the two remote segments, JMR and A-loop. A strong correlation between the communication profile and the structural and dynamical features of KIT in the native and mutated forms was established. Our results provide new insight on the determinants of receptor KIT constitutive activation by mutations and resistance of KIT mutants to inhibitors. Depiction of an intra-molecular component of the communication network constitutes a first step towards an integrated description of vast communication pathways established by KIT in physiopathological context...|$|R
