Therefore, it is useful to be able to obtain such joint information directly from part geometry and contact physics. The method presented here handles all lower pairs of kinematic joints. Surface mating contacts are classified into one of three types: planar, spherical and cylindrical. The contacts are represented by algebraic inequalities describing the translational and angular velocities at the contact. Non-penetration co [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 20 th century, artists have been turning to live gestures of the human body as one means among many others to express their ideas. Various forms of ‘live art’ played an important part in the history of modern art; from Futurism, the Bauhaus and Dada, to Happening, Fluxus and conceptual art. Although the history of performance in its broadest sense – i. e. any form of ‘live art’ – can be spread over the whole 20 th century, performance art became accepted as a medium of artistic expression in its own right in the 1970 s. In the Netherlands, performance has also flourished as a ‘new’ and independent artistic medium in this period. Several artists contributed {{to the development of the}} experimental art form there, among them both Dutchmen and foreigners who had settled in the Netherlands in the 1960 s and 1970 s. In this thesis the focus will firstly be on the characterization of performance art in the Netherlands and the demonstration of covering tendencies in the fields of content, form and attitude. In addition, the international relations of Netherlands-based performance artists and the interaction these contacts brought about, will be examined. (Important in this respect are structural relation networks between Dutch artists and foreign artists living in the Netherlands; but also <b>incidental</b> <b>contacts</b> with foreign artists from abroad.) These two focus points together will reveal the consequences of international relations for the development and characteristics of performance art in the Netherlands...|$|R

40|$|Stiction, {{which results}} from contact between surfaces, {{is a major}} failure mode in micro {{electro-mechanical}} systems (MEMS). Indeed microscopic structures tend to adhere to each other when their surfaces enter into contact and when the restoring forces are unable to overcome the interfacial forces. Since <b>incidental</b> <b>contacts</b> cannot be completely excluded and since contacts between moving parts {{can be part of}} the normal operation of some types of MEMS, stiction prediction is an important consideration when designing micro and nano-devices. In this paper a micro-macro multi-scale approach is developed in order to predict possible stiction. At the lower scale, the unloading adhesive contact-distance curves of two interacting rough surfaces are established based on a previously presented model [L. Wu et al., J. Appl. Phys. 106, 113502, 2009]. In this model, dry conditions are assumed and only the van der Waals forces as adhesion source are accounted for. The resulting unloading adhesive contact-distance curves are dependant on the material and on surface properties, such as, elastic modulus, surface energy and on the rough surfaces topography parameters; the standard deviation of asperity heights and the asperities density. At the higher scale, a finite element analysis is considered to determine the residual cantilever beam configuration due to the adhesive forces once contact happened. Toward this end, the adhesive contact-distance curve computed previously is integrated {{on the surface of the}} finite elements as a contact law. Effects of design parameters can then be studied for given material and surface properties. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Collaboration between general {{practitioners}} (GPs) and specialists {{has been}} the focus of many collaborative care projects during the past decade. Unfortunately, quite a number of these projects failed. This raises the question of what motivates medical specialists to initiate and continue participating with GPs in new collaborative care models. The following question is addressed in this study: What motivates medical specialists to initiate and sustain new models for collaborating with GPs? Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with eighteen medical specialists in the province of Groningen, in the North of The Netherlands. The sampling criteria were age, gender, type of hospital in which they were practicing, and specialty. The interviews were recorded, fully transcribed, and analysed by three researchers working independently. The resulting motivational factors were grouped into categories. Results 'Teaching GPs' and 'regulating patient flow' (referrals) appeared to dominate when the motivational factors were considered. In addition, specialists want to develop relationships with the GPs on a more personal level. Most specialists believe that there is not much they can learn from GPs. 'Lack of time', 'no financial compensation', and 'no support from colleagues' were considered to be the main concerns to establishing collaborative care practices. Additionally, projects were often experienced as too complex and time consuming whereas guidelines were experienced as too restrictive. Conclusion Specialists are particularly interested in collaborating because the GP is the gatekeeper for access to secondary health care resources. Specialists feel that they are able to teach the GPs something, but they do not feel that they have anything to learn from the GPs. With respect to professional expertise, therefore, specialists do not consider GPs as equals. Once personal relationships with the GPs have been established, an informal network with <b>incidental</b> professional <b>contact</b> seems to be sufficient to satisfy the collaborative needs of the specialist. The concerns seem to outweigh any positive motivational forces to developing new models of collaborative practice. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: There is {{currently}} a lack of investigation of injuries in junior sport, {{compared to that of}} adult cohorts. Consequently, very few published studies have demonstrated the incidence of injuries among young participants of Australian football. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the current rate of injury in junior Australian football, and describe the patterns and severity of these injuries across all levels of play, compared to those of McMahon et al. [1]. Methods: The Junior Australian Football Safety Study was completed during 2004 using teams from New South Wales and Victoria across nine levels of play (U 9 to U 18). Participation and injury data were collected prospectively from all games and training sessions by Primary Data Collectors. The region, nature and cause of injury were collected on injuries that were defined in accordance with a previous 1993 study. Injury severity was identified by the action of players immediately after the injury event. Results: Overall, 40, 208 hours of exposure were recorded with an injury rate of 18. 0 injuries per 1, 000 player hours (95 % CI= 16. 6 - 19. 3). Hand/finger injuries were common among all players. The main causes of injury were body contact (67 %), other contact (12 %) and game movement (10 %). There was an increase in the frequency of sprains and strains, and injury severity with level of play. Of the injuries where the player left the field of play, 63 % were able to return to participation. The rates of injury for players who did not continue participation or were advised to seek further medical aid were low. Only 28 % of all injured players were advised to seek medical treatment with few injuries taken to hospital (5 %). Conclusion: An observed reduction of injury rate in the U 15 level of play compared to a similar 1993 study (McMahon et al.), suggests that safe game development at the junior level is likely to have been effective over the past decade. Implications for future skill development include the introduction of <b>incidental</b> body <b>contact</b> skills with further ball-handling skill development in young players, and the introduction of proprioception exercises for players at higher levels of play...|$|R

The importance of built environment attributes for walking is known, but few studies of older adults have examined neighbourhood destinations and none have investigated access to specific, objectively-measured commercial destinations and walking. Methods We undertook a secondary analysis of data from the Western Australian state government’s health surveillance survey for those aged 65 – 84 years and living in the Perth metropolitan region from 2003 – 2009 (n[*]=[*] 2, 918). Individual-level road network service areas were generated at 400 m and 800 m distances, and {{the presence or absence}} of six commercial destination types within the neighbourhood service areas identified (food retail, general retail, medical care services, financial services, general services, and social infrastructure). Adjusted logistic regression models examined access to and mix of commercial destination types within neighbourhoods for associations with self-reported walking behaviour. Results On average, the sample was aged 72. 9 years (SD[*]=[*] 5. 4), and was predominantly female (55. 9 %) and married (62. 0 %).

Access to medical care services within 400 m (OR[*]=[*] 0. 77, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 63 - 0. 93) and 800 m (OR[*]=[*] 0. 83, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 70 - 0. 99) reduced the odds of sufficient walking.

For most techniques in robot trajectory generation, such as heuristic-based geometric planning, {{this has led to}} putting a high cost on contact with the world. This approach and methodology can be prohibitive to robots operating in many unmodeled and dynamic environments. This dissertation presents work on using haptic based feedback (torque and tactile sensing) to formulate a controller for robot manipulation in clutter. We define “clutter” as any environment in which we expect the robot to make both <b>incidental</b> and purposeful <b>contact</b> while maneuvering and manipulating. The controllers developed in this dissertation take the form of single or multi-time step Model Predictive Control (a form of optimal control which incorporates feedback) which attempts to regulate contact forces at multiple locations on a robot arm while reaching to a goal. The results and conclusions in this dissertation are based on extensive testing in simulation (tens of thousands of trials) and testing in realistic scenarios with real robots incorporating tactile sensing. The approach is novel {{in the sense that it}} allows contact and explicitly incorporate the contact and predictive model of the robot arm in calculating control effort at every time step. The expected broader impact of this research is progress towards a new foundation of reactive feedback controllers that will include a higher likelihood of success in many constrained and dynamic scenarios such as reaching into containers without line of sight, maneuvering in cluttered search and rescue situations or working with unpredictable human co-workers.
