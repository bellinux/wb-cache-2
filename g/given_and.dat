It's said about {{the expression}} of <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> accepting, that there are seven <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> accepting verbs and these verbs have a complicated system like honorific and unhonorific expression, inside and outside expression in Japanese, but Chinese is very easy and just has one verb without any systems by okutukeiitirou. In fact, because there are honorific and unhonorific expression in Japanese, there is a direction of {{up and down in the}} relationship between <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> accepting. On the other hand, in Chinese, the verb for <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> accepting doesn't have a difference between honorific and unhonorific expressions, so maybe there is no direction up and down just from the verb. In this paper, comparison of Japanese and Chinese about the direction of up and down in the relationship between <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> accepting will be looked at with a focus on the verbs of <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> accepting in Japanese...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{frequent}} use of surveys to study charitable <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> volunteering, {{little is known about}} the quality of the data collected. This article discusses the challenges associ-ated with designing <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> volunteering surveys, suggests strategies for improving measures of <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> volunteering, and shows how they were applied in the design of Canada’s 1997 National Survey of <b>Giving,</b> Volunteering <b>and</b> Participating. Surveys are frequently used to collect data about <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> volunteering; however, the quality of the data is seldom known, and the measurement chal-lenges inherent in such surveys are not well recognized. For example, the inability of respondents to accurately recall past behaviors introduces both random errors and probable downward biases to estimates of <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> vol-unteering. On the other hand, the tendency of some respondents to provide socially desirable responses may lead to an overreporting of <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> volun-teering. The extent to which these two potential sources of bias may offset one another is seldom known and varies from survey to survey according to the particular way in which <b>giving</b> <b>and</b> volunteering are measured.

For example, the <b>given</b> <b>and</b> solution spheres can be resized so that one given sphere is shrunk to point while maintaining tangency. Inversion in this point reduces Apollonius' problem to finding a plane that is tangent to three given spheres. There are in general eight such planes, which become the solutions to the original problem by reversing the inversion and the resizing. This problem was first considered by Pierre de Fermat, and many alternative solution methods have been developed over the centuries.|$|E
