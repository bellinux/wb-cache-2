5000|$|Woods {{was known}} for her first role as the eponymous {{character}} of [...] "Debbie" [...] in the 1978 feature adult film Debbie Does Dallas. She received top billing, and a photo of her in a bogus uniform was prominently advertised on theater marquees where she was falsely described as a former Dallas Cowboys Cheerleader. Woods had previously tried out for the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders in real life, but was cut during auditions. [...] Her partners in the non-simulated sexual intercourse she engaged in for the film included Robert Kerman, and others drawn from {{the small group of}} veteran performers who appeared in most US hard-core pornography made in the US during that era. Woods said her involvement in adult films was arranged by a female friend to whom she owed money. The producer/director, Jim Clark, said he created the stage name 'Bambi Woods' in an allusion to the Disney character: [...] "I named her Bambi Woods. There wasn't any real reason behind it. Bambi ... a deer. In the woods. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> deeper?" [...] One reviewer in a TV documentary about the film expressed the opinion that Woods's demeanor during sex scenes was in keeping with her pseudonym, being reminiscent of a deer caught in car headlights.|$|E
5000|$|John Quiñones {{was born}} in San Antonio, Texas on May 23, 1952. He is a {{fifth-generation}} San Antonian and a fifth-generation American, Quiñones {{grew up in a}} Spanish-speaking household and did not learn English until he started school at age 6. When he was 13 years old, his father was laid off from his job as a janitor and John's family, including sisters Irma and Rosemary, joined a caravan of migrant farmworkers and journeyed to Traverse City, Michigan to harvest cherries. Later that summer, the Quiñones family followed the migrant route to pick tomatoes outside of Toledo, Ohio. John will never forget the words from his father, Bruno early one morning as they knelt on the cold, hard ground of Ohio's tomato fields. [...] "Juanito, {{do you want to do}} this for the rest of your life? Or, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a college education?" [...] It was a no-brainer. Determined to overcome the current Hispanic stereotypes of being uneducated, he decided to attend college. While attending Brackenridge High School in San Antonio, Quiñones was selected to take part in the federal anti-poverty program, Upward Bound, which prepared inner-city high school students for college. [...] "Upward Bound saved my life," [...] he says. John attended St. Mary's University, in San Antonio. As an undergraduate, Quiñones was also a member of the Sigma Beta-Zeta of Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity. After graduating from St. Mary's with a bachelor's degree in Speech Communication, Quiñones earned his master's degree from Columbia University's School of Journalism.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the close}} of the eighties Ford left the film {{business}} and attempted a second career as an author, writing two books. The two books he wrote were Panic on Sunset (1989), and The Casting Couch (1990) ("the true story of broken dreams, disillusionment and fallen idols"). Panic on Sunset concerns George Schapner, the stressed out manager/agent of Velma Torraine a vamp of the silent screen whose heavy Brooklyn accent spells the end of her career as the 'talkie' era approaches. A visit to a Hollywood whorehouse specialising in celebrity look-a-likes provides George with an unlikely solution to their problem. The Casting Couch was a collaborative effort with the late agent Alan Selwyn, and is credited under the joint pseudonym [...] "Selwyn Ford". Confusingly the book portrays Selwyn Ford as an actual person. A non-fiction expose of early Hollywood à la Hollywood Babylon, among the allegations in the book are that Joan Crawford once appeared in a stag film (in a chapter entitled [...] "Joan Crawford - A Star is Porn"), and that Bella Darvi had worked as a prostitute in a Parisian brothel of which Ford had [...] "benefited from a conducted tour of in 1959". One of the final chapters [...] "The Long Killing of Marilyn", alleges Marilyn Monroe was murdered {{as a result of an}} affair with Robert Kennedy. Ford bases this assumption on a meeting [...] "Selwyn Ford" [...] had with the actor Peter Lawford, in 1984 over a never made, Italian financed film called Bloody Mary, in which an actress is abducted and forced to have an abortion after having an affair with a powerful, married man. Upon reading the script Lawford is said to have remarked [...] "are you crazy, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> us all fucking killed", and walked off. Ford's conclusion was that Lawford had interpreted the script as having parallels with Monroe and Kennedy (something Ford denies in the book), and that Lawford's heated reaction validates his claims over Monroe's death. Recent evidence uncovered by filmmaker Philippe Mora would appear to offer credibility to Ford's claim.A third book Bella, about Darvi and Darryl Zanuck was never completed, Ford died after a heart attack in a branch of WH Smith.|$|E

But I couldn’t find that in her school report. You can’t just send someone to special education. That’s something you do after an interview with a psychologist, and then you’ve got a long list of conditions you’ve got to meet […]. And my sister, she’s very much like: “Well, the school knows best. I’ll go along with it”. But I’m not like that. I want to see those files. “What do you base that conclusion on?

So I tell them: “First do the PR, and then we’ll see”. But they didn’t do that neither,so now she’s still attending regular education. So that was a time that I intervened…but that was more because I felt: “something is wrong here”.

Summon is an intuitive and fast search engine {{that helps you}} discover relevant information on any topic. It searches through our collection of books, scholarly journals, newspaper articles, e-books, DVDs and more in a single step. Rather than search {{for all of these}} things in separate databases, Summon provides a single search box. From your search results, it is one step to the full text of articles or you can see if a book is available. Results are ranked in a single list according to relevance. Many users will find that Summon points them to all the information they need. Other researchers will want to dig deeper or use search tools not available in Summon. Specialized databases remain available using the native interfaces and the Classic Catalog is still available. We hope you find this new search tool simple and easy to use. Give it a try at library. aus. edu Arabic Collection on the Move During the mid-semester break the library staff will be moving the Arabic language books from the 1 st floor Arabic Collection room and will be integrating them into the General and Reference collections.

It’s almost killing me. Corrine was the one I finally had to tell. It was awful, honey. I just had to tell somebody. She’s the one whose husband is a student officer. He’s {{training}} to be a pilot, too. She was telling me how lonesome she was 2 ̆ 6 {{so we had a}} long talk 2 ̆ 6 I dragged her off in a corner 2 ̆ 6 told her. She was real excited about it and was happy too. You know I was thinking about what you said about not marrying me at all if we waited until after the war. I’m not sure if I can explain this or not but I’ll try. Before everything I’ve planned, sorta, about ever getting married was “after the war. ” Real indefinite and everything. But now, this all seems so definite because there’s a definite date more or less. Golly. Are you sure you really want to get married in March? I’m still in a daze. Golly. Oh, did you have a good time last night? You probably did, darn it! Was she nice? Last night before I went to sleep, you know how you lie in bed 2 ̆ 6 daydream, well, I was doing that. I was just not thinking of anything in particular 2 ̆ 6 {{all of a sudden you}} were there. It was the most peculiar feeling. I felt so funny. It wasn’t like a dream or anything I’ve ever seen or felt before. What did you do last night? Hope you had a miserable time!! ____________(time passing) _______________ It’s about four hours later now 2 ̆ 6 I’m home now. Got your letter. The one that you wrote last Friday. You were pretty good about writing last week but you should be even “gooder” this week. I really have will power. Honestly, all day I was absolutely dying to tell the kids but I didn’t. I want to really surprise them. Corrine (she’s the one I finally had to tell) made a bet that before the Friday after next I’d tell all the kids. But I won’t. (It says here). The one good thing is that Jackie is getting married in three weeks this Wednesday and they’re all talking about that. What time <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married, honey? Not at that ungodly hour of 10 like Melene did. Honey, please don’t write anything to anyone because I’m afraid it might get to that fellow before I have a chance to tell him. Oh, yes, I almost forgot. Got a letter from him tonight. He seems pretty sure that he’s going overseas soon. Don’t you think I’d better write him now. It would be awful if he went over before I told him. I’ve never had to do anything like this before and I’m not sure what would be the fair thing to do. What do you think, honey? I’ll do whatever you think is best. Judson, are you really sure you know what you’re doing and what we’re getting into and everything? Are you sure you want to get married while you’re so young? After the war will you be sorry that you have a wife when all the kids start running around again? When everyone else is going out on dates 2 ̆ 6 everything? Well, honey, please write soon. Don’t forget to answer my questions. I love you very much. Golly. There’s almost a whole week left. Only one day’s over. Every time you go back I miss you so much more.
