500|$|In {{their first}} season {{back in the}} top division, Forest won the Championship by a seven-point margin ahead of runners-up Liverpool, conceding just 24 goals in 42 games with Shilton in goal. They also won the League Cup, with a 1–0 win over Liverpool in the replay, despite Shilton, David Needham and Archie Gemmill all being {{non-eligible}} to play as they were cup-tied. In February 1979, Taylor authorised the English game's first £1 million transfer, when Forest purchased Trevor Francis from Birmingham City. Taylor later reported that Clough had been holding out for a fee of £925,000 until Taylor rang Birmingham to confirm the deal at £1 million, before ringing Clough to say [...] "We've got Francis, I've just paid their price"; Clough replied simply by saying [...] "Good", and then put <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b>|$|E
500|$|While most of {{the other}} songs on the Spice album {{required}} two or three days of studio time, [...] "Wannabe" [...] was recorded in less than an hour. The solo parts were divided between Brown, Bunton, Chisholm, and Halliwell. Victoria Adams missed {{most of the}} writing session and communicated {{with the rest of the}} group on a mobile phone. In her autobiography, she wrote: [...] "I just couldn't bear not being there. Because whatever they said about how it didn't matter, it did matter. Saying 'Yes, I like that' or 'Not sure about that' <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> is not the same." [...] She contributed backing vocals and sings during the chorus. Rowe stayed up all night working on the song, and it was finished by morning, the only later addition was the sound of Brown's footsteps as she ran to the microphone.|$|E
500|$|Lennon gave Mimi an {{allowance}} of £30 per week, {{but when she}} found out that his wife's mother was being given the same amount, she phoned the Lennons' house and said, [...] "What has she [...] done to deserve anything? Tell John, when you speak to him, that I am very, very annoyed", before slamming <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> Lennon moved to New York in 1971, and never returned to England again. Despite losing touch with several family members, he kept in close contact with her and telephoned her every week. On 5 December 1980, three days before Lennon was murdered, he called her to say he was homesick and was planning a trip back to England. After Lennon's death, Mimi was furious to find out that he had never transferred the ownership of the house over to her, which meant that Ono owned the house, and could sell it at any time.|$|E

5000|$|Linear Bounded Phenogram is {{a visual}} novel {{in which the}} player {{advances}} through text and dialogue to read through several short stories; by using the player characters' cell phones to make different choices and responses in the [...] "phone trigger" [...] system, the player can affect {{the direction of the}} game's plot. In the iPhone version of the game, the player picks up and puts <b>down</b> <b>the</b> in-game <b>phone</b> by holding <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> they are playing on vertically or horizontally, respectively.|$|R
2500|$|The three {{suspects}} Viktor Sayenko ( [...] , [...] ), Igor Suprunyuk ( [...] , [...] ) and Alexander Hanzha ( [...] , [...] ) {{were arrested}} on 23 July 2007. Suprunyuk attempted {{to sell a}} mobile phone stolen from a victim in a local pawn shop, asking for 150 hryvnia (around 30 USD in 2007). Law enforcement agents tracked <b>the</b> <b>phone's</b> location. Suprunyuk and Sayenko were arrested near the cash register of the shop. Hanzha was arrested at home, reportedly managing to flush other stolen mobile <b>phones</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> toilet. <b>The</b> <b>phones</b> were recovered, but all information on them was lost.|$|R
500|$|Sammy Davis, Jr. was {{instrumental}} in bringing about a general change in policy. When the Will Mastin Trio began performing at Sands in 1958, Davis informed Entratter that his father and uncle must be allowed permission to stay at Sands while he was performing there. [...] Entratter granted them permission but continued his objection to admitting other black guests. In 1961, an African-American couple entered {{the lobby of the}} hotel and were blocked by the security guard, witnessed by Sinatra and Davis. [...] Sinatra told the guards that they were his guests and let them into the hotel. Sinatra subsequently swore profusely <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> to Sands executive Carl Cohen at how ridiculous the situation was, and the following day, Davis approached Entratter and demanded that Sands begin employing blacks. Shortly afterwards the hotel changed its policy and it began hiring black waiters and busboys, and began permitting blacks entry into the casino.|$|E
500|$|Roger Moore of The Seattle Times showed mixed {{feelings}} in his review: [...] "Rare is the thriller that goes as completely and utterly wrong as The Call does at almost precisely the one-hour mark. Which is a crying shame, because {{for an hour}} this is a riveting, by-the-book kidnapping." [...] Moore explained {{what he saw as}} the highs and lows: [...] "Brad Anderson turns this...serial-killer hunt...into a real edge-of-your-seat thriller. Given...a half-decent tale of horror, guilt, problem-solving and redemption, Anderson couldn't go far wrong," [...] but, Moore states, [...] "It's only when our Oscar-winning heroine puts <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and sets out to do some sleuthing of her own that The Call disconnects, turning into something far more generic and far less exciting." [...] The Los Angeles Times turned in a similar review: [...] "The semi-fresh thriller, set mainly in an emergency call center and on the freeways of Los Angeles, puts a tech slant on a damsel-in-distress setup. It buzzes along for a while, the promising plot innovations inviting suspension of disbelief, before by-the-numbers implausibility, over-the-top valor and unsavory contrivances take over and the line goes dead." ...|$|E
500|$|After a {{short period}} of inactivity, Dickinson once again teamed up with Roy Z and Tribe of Gypsies to record his next album, Accident of Birth; [...] "It was {{actually}} Roy that dragged me back into some assemblance, because he called up and he said, 'Listen, I've got some stuff and it's like a metal record.' And I wasn't thrilled, I wasn't really sure that I had anything to offer... Then he played me some backing-tracks he'd done for what was to become Accident of Birth <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and I thought 'There is something there.'" [...] Former Iron Maiden guitarist, Adrian Smith, was asked to guest on the record, but remained as a full-time member of Dickinson's solo outfit. The album marked a return to heavy metal for Dickinson, with Sputnikmusic remarking, [...] "The album's heavy feel is very satisfying, and definitely fills that void left by Maiden during the 90's." [...] The follow-up, The Chemical Wedding, was a semi-concept album on alchemy, which drew inspiration from William Blake's writings; with some songs, such as [...] "Book of Thel", having the same title as some of his poems, and the cover artwork featuring one of his paintings. The record was even more successful than its predecessor, with Sputnikmusic commenting, [...] "Bruce had shattered all expectations to create an album that might even be better than the previous one." [...] During The Chemical Weddings supporting tour, the live album, Scream for Me Brazil was recorded in São Paulo, after which Dickinson and Smith returned to Iron Maiden in February 1999.|$|E
50|$|In Wales, former Torchwood {{operative}} {{and young}} mother Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) is called out of exile by her old colleague Andy Davidson (Tom Price), who informs {{her that her}} father Geraint (William Thomas) has had two heart attacks, but has not died. Gwen is persuaded not to investigate the strange events any further by her husband Rhys Williams (Kai Owen), but Rex links Torchwood with the worldwide miracle and, with Esther's help, tracks Gwen <b>down</b> using <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> call data from Davidson's phone.|$|R

50|$|On February 7, 2006, a {{few days}} before the {{theatrical}} release of a Curious George motion picture, Shalleck's body was discovered, partially hidden, at his home in Boynton Beach, Florida, a victim of a robbery/homicide.

500|$|In 2000, Björk starred on {{her acting}} debut Dancer in the Dark. Whilst {{she worked on}} the film, she also began {{producing}} her next album, writing new music and teaming with new collaborators. She {{had to go to}} Denmark to work on the film and there was nothing going on. She was lying on the beach whilst looking at the ocean, with a ghetto blaster listening to producer Thomas Knak's music. When she realised he was from Copenhagen, she called him up". [...] "Cocoon", produced by Knak, {{was one of the last}} songs to be written for the album; its melody came to Björk in a sudden rush and she contacted him. She made a long-distance, late-night phone call to Knak in Denmark, and woke him up. [...] "I didn't have any track of time so she didn't really know that I was asleep. She was explaining that she had this melody in her head and maybe, if I had the time, she would still have two or three weeks to decide if this track could be worked on", said the producer. Knak took it as a chance to make a more minimal track, similar to his own releases. He liked the idea of having two songs on the album, and immediately after he put <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> he started working. His original treatment of [...] "Cocoon", made with an Ensoniq ASR-10, appeared relatively intact in the final version. Knak elaborated: [...] "She had two changes: one for one semitone up and another for I think about 20BPM slower or something. I don't really make music so I'm not really used to thinking could the singer really sing in a tempo. From there she started working on the lyrics and one more melody for the vocal".|$|E

2500|$|The Nazis {{disguised}} their [...] "Final Solution" [...] as {{the mass}} [...] "resettlement to the east". The victims {{were told they}} were being taken to labour camps in Ukraine. In reality, from 1942 on for most Jews, deportations meant only death at either Bełżec, Chełmno, Sobibór, Majdanek, Treblinka, or Auschwitz-Birkenau. Some trains that had already transported goods to the Eastern front on their return carried human cargo bound for extermination camps. The plan was being realized in the utmost secrecy. In late 1942 during a telephone conversation Hitler's private secretary Martin Bormann admonished Heinrich Himmler who was informing him about 50,000 Jews already exterminated in a concentration camp in Poland. [...] "They were not exterminated – Bormann screamed – only evacuated, evacuated, evacuated!" [...] and slammed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> wrote Enghelberg.|$|E
50|$|There {{was another}} news report in Apple Daily on 1 July 2006 that a help seeker, Mr. So, <b>phoned</b> <b>the</b> hotline center {{and asked for}} an {{appointment}} with a social worker. The hotline volunteer jotted <b>down</b> <b>the</b> ID and <b>phone</b> number of Mr. So {{and told him to}} wait for the call back in seconds, but it turned out that Mr. So had been waiting for up to 9 hours. The reason of the late call as claimed was <b>the</b> mistaken <b>phone</b> number.|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Q magazine, Mika says: [...] The song {{was inspired by a}} well-dressed, good-looking man Mika and his sister saw walking down a street in London shouting <b>down</b> his <b>phone.</b> <b>The</b> song uses a musical technique called musique concrète in which the music is devised by using everyday objects to make sound. In this particular song, the beat is created by Mika hitting his desk, clapping his hands and stamping his feet.|$|R
5000|$|On the street, Kramer and Elaine {{run into}} her friend Dan and his friends, who {{tell them they}} are going to the Nazi rally to protest O'Brien. He then {{mentions}} no one knows what O'Brien looks like. As George explains to Jerry that he is attracted to Eva, they plan to have the limo drive back to the Upper West Side and get out when they see Elaine and Kramer, who realizes that Jerry must be the O'Brien at the rally, which explains the limo. As it drives past them, Kramer sees Jerry and shouts, [...] "O'Brien!" [...] This attracts other protesters across the street standing at a bus stop. As Kramer and Elaine dive through the door and they chase <b>the</b> limo <b>down</b> <b>the</b> street, <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> rings. Kramer picks up and hands it to Eva. She listens for a few seconds and tells the others, [...] "It's O'Brien." [...] Tim and Eva pull out their guns and demand that George and Jerry say who they really are, and Jerry and George, and later Elaine, all quickly and nervously attempt to explain themselves at the same time. The car pulls up to the Paramount and the protesters begin rocking it. Dan notices Elaine as one of the passengers, and she awkwardly acknowledges him. George is placed in front of the news teams identified as Donald O'Brien, and the protesters horde around him as he frantically denies being O'Brien and shouts for Jerry.|$|R

50|$|The {{basis for}} the myth was a feature of BlackBerry phones: If the battery level was too low, the phone {{automatically}} locked down phone features and shut <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> radio for all calls except to emergency services.

25|$|Reportedly, the Packers were {{in talks}} with Oakland Raiders wide {{receiver}} Randy Moss {{at the behest of}} Brett Favre. If the Packers had made the move to acquire the 30-year-old wide receiver, the trade would no doubt have been a controversial one, as Moss has a long and storied history with the Green Bay franchise. While Moss's salary was high, Green Bay, at the time, reportedly had $24 million of cap space, and could have absorbed his contract easily. These rumors were put to an end on April 29, 2007, when Oakland dealt Moss to New England for a 4th round draft pick. In the days following the NFL draft, Favre was upset concerning Green Bay's inability to acquire Moss. Favre was reportedly so upset that his agent requested that the Packers trade him. Coach Mike McCarthy was able to calm Favre <b>down</b> over <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> and Favre eventually admitted that while he wanted to win, {{he did not want to}} be traded in order to do so.|$|R

But finally, {{just as they are}} all sitting <b>down</b> to supper, <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> rings one last time. A man believed to be Paul the Painter has been arrested at London Airport.

50|$|By mid-2012, Nett Warrior had {{recovered}} from the 10-pound Ground Soldier System's requirement overreach and cost spiraling to survive {{with the use of}} smartphones mounted inside the chest of a soldier's vest and connected to Rifleman radios on their backs. Having <b>the</b> <b>phones</b> on their chests was more comfortable and preferred to previous versions that were connected to their wrists with wires running <b>down</b> their arms. <b>The</b> <b>phones</b> can't make calls, but are used to see other soldiers’ positions, mark IED and enemy troop positions, and even text each other. The smartphone used was the Motorola Atrix, which helped users due to their familiarity with commercial devices. Army leaders exclusively run <b>the</b> <b>phones</b> on <b>the</b> Android operating system because of its open architecture. The Army plans to field 600 Nett Warrior systems in each Infantry Brigade Combat Team to be worn by squad leaders. This will give squads access to Blue Force Tracking and connect them to the Tactical Ground Reporting (TIGR) system to report what they see in the field, like enemy positions, biometrics, and weapons caches. Problems with using the Atrix smartphone included low-resolution and glaring screens and a low battery life of 3-4 hours.|$|R
