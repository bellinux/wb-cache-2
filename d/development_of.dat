40|$|According to the {{viewpoints}} of predecessors, {{we define}} the signification <b>of</b> <b>development</b> right <b>of</b> agricultural land and connotation {{of the price}} <b>of</b> <b>development</b> right <b>of</b> agricultural land as follows, the <b>development</b> right <b>of</b> agricultural land {{is to change the}} former use nature of agricultural land, so as to become the right of construction Use land; the price <b>of</b> <b>development</b> right <b>of</b> agricultural land refers to the price that is difference between the price of construction use land, and summation of the price of former agricultural land. the expense of developing agricultural land, the expense of management, and profit, after the agricultural land is transformed into non-agricultural construction use land. By using the principle of economics of land, this paper expounds the generation mechanism of the price <b>of</b> <b>development</b> right <b>of</b> agricultural land, namely the diversity of agricultural land use and the change of demand and supply <b>of</b> <b>development</b> right <b>of</b> agricultural land. The influencing factors <b>of</b> the <b>development</b> right <b>of</b> agricultural land are analyzed, and there are mainly the price of agricultural land, the price of construction use land, the contradiction of demand and supply of urban land, land use, and agricultural land.

They include frank {{teratogenicity}} such as cleft palate and hydronephrosis. <b>Development</b> <b>of</b> some organs {{may be even more}} sensitive: very low doses perturb the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> sexual organs in rodents, and the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> teeth in rats. The latter is important in that tooth deformities were also seen after the Seveso accident and possibly after a long breast-feeding of babies in the 1970s and 1980s when the dioxin concentrations in Europe were about ten times higher than at present.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Kistiakowsky was {{the head}} of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) section {{responsible}} for the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> explosives, and the technical director of the Explosives Research Laboratory (ERL), where he oversaw the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> new explosives, including RDX and HMX. He was involved in research into the hydrodynamic theory of explosions, and the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> shaped charges. In October 1943, he was brought into the Manhattan Project as a consultant. He was soon placed in charge of X Division, which was responsible for the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> the explosive lenses necessary for an implosion-type nuclear weapon. In July 1945, he watched as the first one was detonated in the Trinity test. A few weeks later another Fat Man implosion-type weapon was dropped on Nagasaki.|$|E

40|$|It is {{referred}} on a didactic experience in which pupils aged 11 - 14 face problematic situations which are to them completely new and which concern the plane <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> solid figures. The activity carried out has enabled the pupils to: i) {{have the chance}} and the motivation to make conjectures; ii) acquire good skills in connecting space to plane and refine their spatial intuition; iii) use with awareness, in a "concrete" context, geometric trasformations and their proprerties; iv) use in a spontaneus way notions connected to topological transformations; v) face in a concrete way activities - even complex ones - of the logical combinatorial kind (classifications, partitions, identifications) for the realization of a double-entrance table. Among the results achieved by the pupils we underline the following: a) the <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> the cube are exactly 11; b) the <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> the right-angled parallelepiped having the three dimensions different are exactly 54; c) the <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> the right-angled parallelepiped having the two dimensions equal are exactly 29; d) the <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> the right-angled parallelepiped (in both cases (b) and (c) {{can be divided into}} 11 classes corresponding to the 11 <b>developments</b> <b>of</b> the cube...|$|R
