40|$|The present paper {{covers and}} {{describes}} {{the influences of}} speed cutting on the part edge quality of blanked parts. Experiment shave been conducted using different material, punch <b>die</b> <b>clearances</b> and different cutting speeds. In {{order to determine the}} reachable cutting speeds and calculate the energy required for blanking, velocity stroke cures were obtained. The quality of the part edges shows that higher cutting speeds can improve the part edge quality, resulting in smaller burr height and rollover, and a larger shear zone. Furthermore, it could be observed that the part quality improvement when blanking with high cutting speeds is much more distinct for stele than for copper or aluminum. According to blanking theory, this improvement was expected because copper and aluminum have much higher heat conduction coefficients. Therefore, the at dissipates faster and the desired stress relief effect does not take place to the same degree as for stele...|$|R

Copper clad laminate is a main raw material for consumer electronics, information and telecommunications devices. The process parameters such as blank temperature, blank thickness and material specifications {{are closely related to}} the characteristics of the punching forces and displacements in copper clad laminates. The proposed system consists of small-scale force transducer, displacement transducer and data acquisition system, with which the punching forces can be measured in each punch steps. A small punch with outer diameter 2 mm is directly connected to the force transducer to measure the pushing and pulling forces during the hole-punching process. Bushings and guide pins are used inside the die configuration in order to ensure path straightness when the punch moves into the die cavity. The experimental results show that the increase of punch and <b>die</b> <b>clearances</b> decreases the punching forces. The same result is obtained with increase of blank temperatures. In the final part of the paper, a computer-aided analysis package DEFORM 2 D is used to understand the deformation and crack initiation of the blank in the small hole-punching process.

40|$|AbstractThe {{usage of}} high-strength-steels {{allows for the}} {{reduction}} of a component's weight by reducing the sheet thickness. During the production process of such components, shear cutting is commonly used for the initial cutting process. One of the main challenges in the production process is imposed by the shearing operation, which yields high tensile loads on the parts’ edges. During the subsequent forming process, edge-cracks occur and therefore limit the forming potential of these materials. Studies at our institute focus on developing a new measuring method to investigate the formation of edge-cracks. This procedure called, an edge-fracture-tensile-test, helps to identify relevant parameters of the shearing process to avoid edge-cracks. The sample geometry resembles the shape of tensile-test-samples. The following test parameters can then be varied: <b>die</b> <b>clearance,</b> cutting edge geometry, and open or closed cutting line.

It combines hydroforming and high energy forming, which first use hydro-forming to shape large character of product, then use high energy to form small features, such as convex tables, bars etc. The present work investigates the shock wave generation of hybrid impact hydroforming. In this paper, the theory of shock wave is presented and finite element simulation was carried out by using MSC. The pressure distribution changes in the depth direction, but not in the width direction. Using this shock wave loading condition we did forming experiments. Punching occurred as a result of combined tensile and shear stress effects. Furthermore, the design precise of <b>die</b> and <b>clearance</b> between punch and die may less strict.

Since a number of autoantigens are located at the cell surface or within apoptotic blebs, we examined whether exposure of mice to syngeneic apoptotic cells by the intravenous route could induce autoantibody production. Normal mice injected with syngeneic apoptotic thymocytes developed antinuclear autoantibodies and anticardiolipin and anti-ssDNA antibodies. The autoantibody levels were generally lower than those observed in MRL/Faslpr mice and were transient. Surprisingly, six out of six immunized mice demonstrated immunoglobulin G deposition in the glomeruli several months after immunization. These findings indicate that systemic exposure to apoptotic cells can induce an immune response in normal mice, and may help to explain antigen selection and initiation of the immune response in diseases characterized by increased rates of apoptosis such as AIDS and, possibly, systemic lupus erythematosus.

40|$|Abstract. Two basic {{types of}} load for the tool active {{elements}} {{can be distinguished}} for the shear cutting process of sheet metal. For high strength, brittle materials, the stamping punch will be exposed to distinctive oscillating axial dynamic loads {{as a result of}} abrupt released potential energy, from the tool active elements, the blanking tool and the stamping press, caused by a sudden cracking of the sheet. In contrast, when shear cutting ductile materials, sheet metal will be drawn into the <b>die</b> <b>clearance</b> and the resulting friction between the punch and the cut surface can cause high forces when pulling the punch out of the hole. When using punches featuring a complex cutting peripheral form,- not available as a standard part- it is necessary to decide between head and shank of the punch manufactured out of one part or a shaft without head, which is usually cheaper and can be manufactured by electro-erosive wire-cutting. In the second case, a linking element must be accepted, transferring the load transmission between shaft and tool. This linking element, realized by a form lock or traction, can be the reason for premature failure of the punch. The two described cases of load, in combination with lacking knowledge of the real load on the link as well as eligibility of different punch linking types for each case of loading, caus...|$|E
