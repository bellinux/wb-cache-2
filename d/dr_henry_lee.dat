25|$|The CIB hired renowned {{forensic}} scientist Henry Lee ({{forensic scientist}}) {{to examine the}} physical evidence. <b>Dr.</b> <b>Henry</b> <b>Lee</b> was famous for defending O.J. Simpson {{in the murder of}} his wife and lover, and helped acquit Simpson based on the LAPD's lack of professionalism and possibility of planted evidence at the murder site. <b>Dr.</b> <b>Henry</b> <b>Lee</b> and his team of Americans had previously established the belly wound was in fact a gunshot wound, and then claimed the windshield hole had been struck from the outside based on the lack of windshield powder outside the jeep. Despite widespread speculation that the casings were planted on the street, Lee expressed no concern regarding the origin of the evidence even though the casings had been found some 3½ hours after the incident occurred and street cleaning had cleaned up the firecracker debris. Dr. Lee was also not critical of the local police and National Security Bureau's inability to secure the scene of the incident afterwards until the casings were found.|$|E

2500|$|DNA {{analysis}} of blood discovered {{on a pair}} of Simpson's socks found in his bedroom identified it as Brown's. The blood had DNA characteristics matched by approximately only one in 9.7billion, with odds falling to one out of 21billion when compiling results of testing done at the two separate DNA laboratories. Both socks had about 20 stains of blood. The blood made a similar pattern {{on both sides of the}} socks. Defense medical expert <b>Dr.</b> <b>Henry</b> <b>Lee</b> of the Connecticut State Police Forensic Science Laboratory testified that the only way such a pattern could appear was if Simpson had a [...] "hole" [...] in his ankle, or a drop of blood was placed on the sock while it was not being worn.

2500|$|Although no {{one else}} was charged, and {{evidence}} points to Simpson's guilt, the murders continue to be the subject of research and speculation. For example, Detective William Dear conducted a lengthy investigation, and his evidence and conclusions, among those of other experts (e.g., <b>Dr.</b> <b>Henry</b> <b>Lee)</b> who have reviewed the crime, trial, and evidence, were addressed in the BBC documentary, OJ: The True Untold Story (2000). The documentary claims that the police and prosecution had contaminated or planted evidence pointing to Simpson as the killer, and ignored exculpatory evidence. Furthermore, it asserts that the state eliminated too hastily other possible suspects, including Simpson's elder son, Jason Simpson, and individuals linked to the drug trade, in which Brown, Goldman, and Faye Resnick participated.

50|$|Following {{the guilty}} verdict, de Lestrade interviewed the jurors {{to find out}} why they reached this verdict. By and large, the jurors were swayed by the amount of blood Kathleen lost and the number of lacerations, which {{indicated}} to them it could not have been an accident. <b>Dr.</b> <b>Henry</b> Chang-Yu <b>Lee,</b> however, had testified at the trial that the amount of blood was irrelevant, as the blood spatter indicated most of it was coughed up rather than from the wounds themselves. He also suggested some of the blood could have been diluted with urine. Lee had also duplicated blood spatter from coughing for the jury by drinking ketchup and spitting it out.|$|R

The prisoners remained separated from each other, Colonel Everard conversing with Nehemiah Holdenough, {{at a distance from}} <b>Dr.</b> Rochecliffe, Sir <b>Henry</b> <b>Lee,</b> and Joceline.
