In order to comprehensively understand {{the impacts of}} plastic <b>greenhouse</b> vegetable <b>cultivation</b> on agricultural ecosystem services and dis-services, we developed an assessment framework for the net ecosystem services and used China as a case study. Our results showed that, compared to conventional vegetable <b>cultivation,</b> plastic <b>greenhouse</b> vegetable <b>cultivation</b> has higher fresh vegetable production, greater CO 2 fixation (3. 61 Â t CO 2 ha-Â  1 Â yr-Â  1), better soil retention (23. 1 Â tÂ ha-Â  1 Â yr-Â  1), and requires less irrigation (2132 Â m 3 Â waterÂ ha-Â  1 Â yr-Â  1), maintains similar soil fertility, but also has higher NO 3 - accumulation and N 2 O emissions. In 2004, plastic <b>greenhouse</b> vegetable <b>cultivation</b> in China provided an overall net economic benefit of 67, 956 Â yuanÂ ha- 1 Â yr-Â  1 (8. 28 Â yuanÂ =Â  1 USD in 2004), where 68, 240 Â yuanÂ ha-Â  1 Â yr-Â  1 represented ecosystem services and 284 Â yuanÂ ha-Â  1 Â yr-Â  1 for dis-services.

50|$|The {{possibility}} of using carbon dioxide enrichment in <b>greenhouse</b> <b>cultivation</b> to enhance plant {{growth has been}} known for nearly 100 years. After the development of equipment for the controlled serial enrichment of carbon dioxide, the technique was established on a broad scale in the Netherlands. Secondary metabolites, e.g., cardiac glycosides in Digitalis lanata, are produced in higher amounts by <b>greenhouse</b> <b>cultivation</b> at enhanced temperature and at enhanced carbon dioxide concentration. Commercial greenhouses are now frequently located near appropriate industrial facilities for mutual benefit. For example, Cornerways Nursery in the UK is strategically placed near a major sugar refinery, consuming both waste heat and CO2 from the refinery which would otherwise be vented to atmosphere. The refinery reduces its carbon emissions, whilst the nursery enjoys boosted tomato yields and does not need to provide its own greenhouse heating.|$|E

40|$|To {{reduce the}} deep {{percolation}} during <b>greenhouse</b> vegetable <b>cultivation,</b> {{the technique of}} subsurface film strips placement was tested. Four treatments with two kinds of cross-sections (flat and U-shaped) and two different spacings (10 cm and 40 cm) of subsurface film strips were arranged in a greenhouse before planting celery. At the same time, a non-film treatment was arranged for comparison. Soil water content was measured and irrigation time was adjusted according to the soil water content. Evapotranspiration of celery during growth was calculated by the method of energy balance and the deep percolation was calculated by the equation of water balance. Deep percolation was reduced in all experimental treatments. Greater reduction in deep percolation was observed when using U-shaped cross-section strips compared with that using the flat cross-section strips. In addition, greater reduction in deep percolation was observed when the spacing between the film strips was smaller. The results of this test showed that the technique of subsurface film strips placement can reduce deep percolation and conserve irrigation water for <b>greenhouse</b> vegetables <b>cultivation.</b> However, the optimal layout variables {{for the use of}} the technique of subsurface film strips placement need further experimental and numerical analysis. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Greenhouse</b> <b>cultivations</b> {{are high}} input systems {{with respect to}} water and {{fertiliser}} usage. Worldwide increasing water shortages and competition for freshwater is raising the awareness that water use efficiency is a necessity in greenhouse horticulture. Releasing drain water from the greenhouse into the environment can also compromise surface and ground water quality due to the emissions of fertilisers and plant protection products. In soilless cultivation the nutrient solution can be recirculated; consequently they are highly efficient and sustainable production systems. Dutch growers have to realise zero emission by 2027 due to agreements made with government. However most are hesitant to fully recycle nutrient solutions, despite the many {{studies that have been}} conducted to resolve technical (installation) and physiological (growth) problems related to recycling drain water. In this study we demonstrate that with current best practice zero-emission crop production can become a reality. In the first trial (cucumber; July-November 2014) and up to the mid-season evaluation point of the second trial (sweet pepper; Dec-July 2015) no differences in production and fruit quality were found between the zero-emission cultivation and the reference cultivation grown to the agreed emission standards of 2015.

40|$|The use of low-impact {{energy sources}} for <b>greenhouse</b> <b>cultivations</b> is growing quickly due to {{environmental}} demands, {{constrained by the}} increased price of fossil energy sources, market demand for low cost greenhouse production, and need for air pollution reduction. This paper demonstrates via environmental analysis the efficiency of a Photovoltaic- Geothermal Heat Pump integrated system (PV-GHP) as a greenhouse heating system, compared to a conventional hot air generator using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG-HG). The tests were carried out in twin experimental greenhouses in the Mediterranean area (Valenzano-Italy). In order to evaluate the environmental performance of a heat pump system with electricity supplied from the national grid, a scenario (GHP Geothermal Heat Pump) was realised.

To achieve high production and quality standards, reducing environment impact, the S. Ag. A Department of Palermo carried out some researches to identify the most suitable fertilization to maximize the productive potential of fresh plug plants of two cultivars of strawberry widespread in the Sicilian area, 'Sabrosa®Candonga' and 'Nora', reducing Nitrogen inputs. The experimental design adopted was a splitplot, in which the main plot was the different doses of nitrogen, 120, 170, 220, 270, 320 kg/ha and the secondary one the cultivar. This research showed a rather wide variability of results, dependent on levels available for plants and doses distributed between the cultures. The seasonal pattern of production showed how the plot fertilized with 270 kg/ha has always achieved the highest harvest, but it's not significant for statistic analysis, in the early productive period (January-March) with the thesis treated with lower doses (120 and 170 kg/ha). The lowest doses (120 and 170 kg/ha) provided the firmest fruits, 735 g, with an high content in total soluble solids content, 7. 3 °Brix, and highest vitamin C, 53 mg/ 100 g of f. w., and a very bright orange-red color. It has been noted that the two cultivars fertilized with medium and low doses produced larger fruits, with a high soluble solids and vitamin C content.

40|$|Closed-loop {{optimisation}} techniques, such as receding horizon {{optimal control}} often have the limitation {{with respect to}} dealing with measurable disturbances that these techniques reject these disturbances in order to track openloop defined optimal input control trajectories. Sometimes measurable disturbances can also be exploited to improve the performance of processes. For example, the amount of sunlight, which is a measurable disturbance in <b>greenhouse</b> vegetable <b>cultivation,</b> can be exploited to improve the <b>greenhouse</b> vegetable <b>cultivation.</b> If disturbances in sunlight are rejected in optimal greenhouse climate control, the cultivation will be sub-optimal. Measurable disturbances can be exploited in closed-loop optimisation by using an iterative optimisation algorithm at each time controls need to be recalculated for adjustment (Rahman and Palanki 1996). Iteration is time consuming, so non-iterative algorithms are needed to recalculate controls. An interesting non-iterative closed-loop optimisation procedure was developed by Palanki, et al. (1993) and Rahman and Palanki (1996). They proposed to develop optimal feedforward/state-feedback laws symbolically for optimal singular regions for this procedure. They also proposed to use minimum or maximum input values for the non-singular regions. To determine switching times between singular and non-singular regions and what values (minimum or maximum) the manipulated inputs take in the non-singular regions, the adjoint equations {{in addition to the}} state-equations needed to be integrated in open-loop (off-line). They recommended using symbolic manipulation software such as MAPLE or MATHEMATICA for the calculation of feedforward/state-feedback laws of large systems, because of the computation {{of a large number of}} necessary Lie-derivatives.

In this work it will be presented an application of a solar cooling plant with absorption cooling machine for thermal control of a greenhouse and an advanced simulation model able to evaluate optimal plant configurations and controls. Solar cooling systems can be applied for greenhouse climate control in regions with high values of solar irradiation as alternative to traditional evaporative systems, allowing the reduction of primary energy consumption by exploiting the contemporaneity between the cooling requirements and the solar energy availability. The plant consists of a single effect LiBr-H 2 O absorption chiller fed by evacuated-tube solar collectors; the model was developed in Matlab-Simulink and is able to simulate dynamically, with time steps up to 15 minutes, the greenhouse cooling demand and the production of the solar field. Present study proposes a plant configuration with a distribution system in which the cooling power is not provided for the entire volume of the greenhouse, but only for the air volume surrounding the crop with a considerable saving of reduction of energy demand and an extremely efficient use of solar energy. The simulation study is based on the experimental data collected at the experimental center of the University of Bari, Southern Italy. The aim of the work is to demonstrate that solar cooling system could provide significant energy-saving opportunities for cooling greenhouses allowing the reduction of primary energy consumption by exploiting the contemporaneity between the cooling requirements and the solar energy availability...|$|R
