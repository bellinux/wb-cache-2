40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to conduct a {{quantitative}} analysis examining the effects of differentiation and attachment on acculturation and relational satisfaction in Asian-Caucasian American <b>international</b> <b>couple</b> relationships. The study hypothesized that differentiation, attachment, and acculturation are factors that influence relational satisfaction in Asian partners within the <b>international</b> <b>couple</b> relationships with Caucasian American partners. It is also hypothesized that differentiation and attachment increase the level of acculturation in the Asian partners. The hypotheses were examined with 42 native-born Chinese, South Korean, and Japanese partners within the <b>international</b> <b>couple</b> relationship with a Caucasian American partner in the United States. Multiple regressions were used to test the hypotheses. Results supported that differentiation and acculturation were significantly related to relationship satisfaction. Differentiation was also significantly associated with acculturation. Overall, the study supported that differentiation and acculturation are important factors influencing the relationship satisfaction in Asian-Caucasian American couples in the United States. The study also showed that differentiation had a significant effect on acculturation in the Asian partners. More importantly, a mediator model was established based on the results. The mediator model supported the idea that acculturation influenced the effect of differentiation on the relationship satisfaction. ...|$|E
40|$|An <b>international</b> <b>couple</b> builds bridges between enemies by {{involving}} them in {{a process}} of pacification and, at a deeper level, reconciliation. Following Norbert Elias's notion of double-bind, the influence of musicians and aesthetics on international conflict transformation is analysed. Namely, Edward Said and Daniel Barenboim embodied a middle-range couple in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (between top leadership focusing on high-level negotiations and grassroots actors such as local leaders and non-governmental organizations), via new symbols of integration such as the West-Eastern Divan Workshop and Orchestra (young musicians from Israel and Arab countries), the Barenboim–Said foundation or a musical centre in Ramallah. As a couple, they developed initiatives to change perceptions of others by improving intercultural relations between Israelis, Arabs, and Palestinians, showing that music can {{play a significant role in}} conflict resolution. Still, they encountered inhibiting factors in the process of reconciliation, despite their shared views about linking music and politics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In recent years, several {{member states}} of the European Union have {{tightened}} the criteria for the legal immigration of a partner from outside the European Union. In the Netherlands, the income requirement for „family formation‟ was raised in 2004 from 100 % to 120 % of the minimum wage, potentially excluding about thirty percent of the working population from eligibility. The outcomes of this measure for <b>international</b> <b>couples</b> and, on the aggregate level, for migration flows were examined {{on the basis of}} administrative trend data and fifty in-depth interviews among <b>international</b> <b>couples.</b> It is demonstrated that the potential power of governments to intervene in partner migration risks being at odds with strongly felt cultural values surrounding partner choice and family life. Partner immigration decreased substantially, especially among poorer groups (ethnic minorities, women, youngsters). At the same time, the measure put pressure on the well-being of a segment of the <b>international</b> <b>couples.</b> In 2010, the European Court of Justice ruled that the Dutch income requirement contradicts the EU directive on family reunification...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} paper proposes {{a framework for}} capturing and studying Technical Management Oversight (TMO) knowledge from past and ongoing international programs. Interviews were conducted with key program personnel from several programs to populate the framework with program data. Programs considered were HAWK, ROLAND, LANCE, MEADS, the International Space Station, and MLRS TGW. These programs had various degrees of international participation and various degrees of <b>international</b> <b>coupling.</b> Valuable insights were captured {{that can be applied}} to the structure and conduct of ongoing and future international programs. Among other conclusions, it is found that U. S. policy has not kept pace with international programs, the degree of <b>international</b> <b>coupling</b> within a program strongly affects management complexity and it is important to know the customers. Restrictions on technology transfer and release of information dramatically affect TMO. Cost share and work share issues strongly impact TMO, and patience and diplomacy are vital...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objectives}} with this paper are {{to give a}} brief overview of the Scope of application of the regulation; of the main conflict-of-law rules adopted by the regulation, in special those that are more relevant to the role that a notary might have in an international divorce situation. The regulation provides citizens with appropriate outcomes in terms of legal certainty, predictability and flexibility, protects weaker partners during divorce disputes and prevents 'forum shopping'. This also helps avoiding complicated, lengthy and painful proceedings. More specifically, it allows <b>international</b> <b>couples</b> to agree in advance which law would apply to their divorce or legal separation as long as the agreed law is the law of the Member State which they have a closer connection with. In case the couple cannot agree, the judges can use a common formula for deciding which country's law applies. This paper will bring to light some risks and coordination difficulties with the regulation and a few matters that the regulation does not apply to...|$|R

Comparing {{with the other}} {{personal}} events, such as birthday and anniversaries, wedding is more complex, because it involves friends and families {{and a range of}} related service activities covering from catering to entertainments and selection of venue. As of today, there are very limited studies regarding the arrival of international tourists for wedding event purposes in Malaysia. Therefore, this study intends to identify the perception of international bridal tourists on Malaysia as their chosen wedding destination. It also aims to find out the most significant characteristics towards the arrival of <b>international</b> wedding bridal <b>couples</b> to have their wedding events in Malaysia. A qualitative approach was considered to be the most effective research method and semi structured interview was used in getting information from the potential couples. This research conducted semi structured online and face to face interviews with nine <b>international</b> bridal <b>couples.</b> Findings clearly revealed that the uniqueness of Malaysian culture and the wedding venue are the main factors why these international bridal tourists choose Malaysia as their wedding destinations. This study provides great benefits towards local event planners especially professional wedding planners on the potential of leveraging the local resources as a wedding tourism destination. Results of the study is useful for maintaining and upgrading of the potential factors to more advance level and could generate more income and indirectly helping to promote Malaysia as a bridal tourism hub among the <b>international</b> bridal <b>couples...</b>|$|R

Under the [...] "family registration" [...] (koseki) system, changes in family status and relationships do not require official approval. Article 763 of the Civil Code of Japan authorizes {{a husband and wife}} to divorce by mutual agreement (kyogi rikon divorces), and more than 90% of all Japanese divorces adopt this fast, simple and entirely non-judicial procedure. Kyogi rikon divorces are entirely non-judicial without the involvement of lawyers or any tribunal.
