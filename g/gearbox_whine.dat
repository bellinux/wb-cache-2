40|$|Abstract – Continuing {{advances}} in the automotive industry in recent years, leading manufacturers of automobiles to develop more and more advanced products from technical and quality point of view and. In addition, consumer needs, now aligned with the high standards achieved, prevent manufacturers to make vehicles of poor quality. The user of the vehicle, in fact, seems to be particularly attentive to the vibro-acoustic emissions. For that reason the major car manufacturers devote significant resources to the NVH sector, which deals with noise and vibration of the vehicle to the vehicle driving comfort. This present work was aimed to analyze two gearboxes, made by the same manufacturer, for the objective assessment of its vibro-acoustic emissions due to the phenomenon of gear whine. Key-Words:- vibro-acoustic emission, <b>gearbox,</b> gear <b>whine</b> noise. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – This article {{reports the}} results of several tests, carried out in optical gear whine noise to {{evaluate}} {{the difference between the}} vibro-acoustic emission of two gearboxes of the same type, one, in particular, showing a micro-geometrical error located on the side of tooth and characterized by lack of material {{at the base of the}} tooth due to a slight drift of the production process. The tests were carried out in fourth gear. The user of the vehicle, in fact, seems to be particularly attentive to the vibro-acoustic emissions. For that reason the major car manufacturers devote significant resources to the Noise, Vibration and Harshness sector, which deals with noise and vibration of the vehicle to the vehicle driving comfort. Key-Words:- vibro-acoustic emission, <b>gearbox,</b> gear <b>whine</b> noise, signal processing, automotive, driving comfort. ...|$|R
