A local court acquitted officers in 2008. In 2010, however, a higher federal court declared the ruling null and void, and ordered a new investigation and trial be launched.|$|E
40|$|Drawing on feminist {{research}} methodologies and theory, this article re-centers critical security studies {{to focus on}} a migrant seeking an alternative form of security after his application for asylum was denied by the state. The two main objectives of this article are; first, to resituate a <b>failed</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker,</b> Qasim, as an agent of international security as understood through his practice of seeking and obtaining security; and, second, to demonstrate a revised performative conceptualization of security through understanding the <b>failed</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> as practicing an embodied theorization of security. The encounter with Qasim shows alternative means of seeking security, which illustrates agency {{on the part of the}} migrant that exists actively outside of the state. This contests the positioning of migrants as passive victims and recognizes a way of being in the world that by necessity cannot rely on a state-based identity. Ethnographic methods, including participant observation and a narrative interview with Qasim, elucidate his practice of security and allow for the development of a theoretical conceptualization of security that remains true to a failed asylum seeker’s practice in the UK...|$|E

40|$|The {{return of}} failed asylum seekers is an {{integral}} part of each state s migration management policy and border control. However such returns must be balanced by respect for human rights. This is especially pertinent in a time when the Norwegian government has made it a major focus of policy to step up their effort to return failed asylum seekers. The purpose of this thesis has therefore been to analyze what the responsibilities of the Norwegian government are towards failed asylum seekers who are forcefully returned. In answering this question, it has been argued for the existence of an extraterritorial obligation to investigate allegations of ill-treatment in the post-return phase. Several dilemmas and chal-lenges present itself in this phase, lack of knowledge being one of them, another being the lack of priority from the political government in Norway. Additionally it seems that the mechanisms put in place function more as a warning sign, than actual protection of the returnee. It concludes that the responsibilities ensure the protection of the <b>failed</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> to a certain degree, but there is a lack of information about the effects of the return. It has, therefore, become apparent that the government can do more to protect failed asy-lum seekers...|$|E
50|$|The {{downward}} trajectory was steep {{enough to}} prompt the Prime Minister when {{speaking at the}} 2004 Labour Party conference to set a target for IND and the Immigration Service that, by 2006, the numbers of <b>failed</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> removed from the UK would exceed the numbers of new applications. This {{became known as the}} “Tipping The Balance” target and the work to meet the target became the organisation's top priority.|$|R
40|$|When an {{individual}} signs {{a contract for}} voluntary repatriation through a private or public body, {{there may be a}} need to draw upon principles of contract law and to test contracts for unconscionability. In the case of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> and refugees, there may be procedural unconscionability when consent is only the result of fear of deportation or imprisonment, and substantive unconscionability when conditions after return include no access to basic necessities or persecution. At the same time, many <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> and refugees do wish to return, despite conditions in the country of origin or because of conditions in the host country. Ethical issues regarding consent are therefore central. Yet, it is unclear how one would ensure consent under such conditions. While {{it may be possible to}} apply principles of paternalism and hypothetical consent in such cases, this may undermine the rights of those who wish to repatriate, and remove an option they otherwise would not have. This article argues that Parfit's Principle of Consent (CP) and Rights Principle (RP) may address these concerns and applies these principles to test for the unconscionability of two policies of repatriation of refugees and <b>failed</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in Israel back to countries in Africa between 2009 and 2013. One policy was implemented by an NGO that repatriated <b>failed</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> to countries deemed safe, although returnees had no legal status to stay in Israel and were therefore at risk of deportation. A second NGO returned individuals to South Sudan, even though this was considered dangerous, but only returned South Sudanese who had the legal status to stay in Israel, as this was considered criteria for true voluntariness in the decision to return. By attempting to apply CP and RP in a test for unconscionability, this article addresses both the ethical dilemmas of repatriation of <b>failed</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> and refugees, as well as possible ways in which contracts, more generally, can be tested for unconscionability...|$|R

30|$|There are few {{reliable}} {{estimates of}} the number of illegal immigrants in the United Kingdom. However, the size of this group is likely to have increased over the last decade. For example, Gordon et al. (2009) provide a central estimate of 618, 000 illegal immigrants in the United Kingdom in 2007. This compares with a central estimate of 430, 000 by Woodbridge (2005) for 2001. There is some uncertainty around these estimates, with Gordon et al. (2009) suggesting that the true figure for 2007 is likely to lie somewhere between 417, 000 and 863, 000. Furthermore, neither study provides a breakdown of their estimates by country of origin, but the majority of illegal immigrants are estimated to be <b>failed</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> rather than overstayers or illegal entrants (Gordon et al. 2009). <b>Failed</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> originate from a wide range of countries, especially the Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Eastern Europe, whereas overstayers are typically from Asia and Africa (Gordon et al. 2009). This suggests that the total number of illegal immigrants from EaP countries in the United Kingdom is also likely to be very small, especially in comparison to the total population of legal immigrants, which is estimated to be around 8 million according to the recently published figures from the 2011 Census.|$|R

30|$|There {{are limits}} to {{external}} solidarity. We see that with the refugee issue where advanced welfare states {{with a high level}} of internal solidarity (Denmark) attempt to stem the tide of refugees. Countries like Germany and Sweden are also reverting to that stance now. In any case, such a policy does not contradict Kymlicka’s model of a multicultural welfare state. We also see differentiated patterns of membership developing within advanced welfare states. “Wanted migrants” (such as the highly skilled) rapidly become fully-fledged members, while “less wanted migrants” (such as temporary low-skilled labour migrants or family migrants) receive limited membership or are tested in terms of their civic integration capabilities, and “unwanted migrants” (such as irregular labour migrants and <b>failed</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers)</b> are excluded from membership. These types of (non-) membership go hand in hand with differences in economic, social and political rights. They have been developed to reduce the potential risks of immigration to the welfare state. If less wanted or unwanted categories of migrants are able to become fully-fledged members too easily, solidarity systems could become unaffordable and lose support. Nevertheless, there will always be internal pressure to relax membership criteria for specific categories of migrant groups. Economic rationality will sometimes support territorial admission and non-deportation, for example if employers want cheap and willing labour, and humanitarian and solidarity considerations may sustain dynamics of membership inclusion. We see the latter happening primarily at local state level with <b>failed</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> Not only do some of them receive limited support by the local state (‘bed, water and bread’ arrangement), but they may even granted amnesty and can rise up the social membership ladder.|$|R
