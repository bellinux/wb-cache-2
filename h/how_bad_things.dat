5|$|After {{damaging}} {{the instrument panel}} with a medical ointment and decapitating the scientist, who {{turns out to be}} an android, Jim escapes from the laboratory through the sewer. While searching for Sara, Jim trips next to the wheelchair-bound man, suspects and attacks him. After realizing that he caused a scene and doubts the man's involvement, he returns to the room of the woman, where he discovers she has captured Sara, now wearing a Snow White costume. The woman rambles about her time as a character princess and tells him <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> happen everywhere, including the decapitation at the park. She again hypnotizes Jim with the necklace, but Sara pulls it off and smashes it, freeing Jim from her spell. He returns to his hotel room and puts his family to bed. Jim suffers with digestive distress, vomits up a large amount of blood and hairballs, which he recognizes as symptoms of the cat flu and realizes that Sophie infected him. He begins to panic and bleed uncontrollably in the bathroom. Elliot enters and Jim begs him for help, but he closes the door on him.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Plugged In criticized Perry's {{decision to}} create an uplifting song about such a serious subject matter as divorce: [...] "Framing the song {{in terms of her}} divorce from Brand, though 'Part of Me', puts a much more somber and serious spin on things. This is no mere breakup. It's the demolition of a marital covenant. So no matter <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> were in her relationship, no matter how much better she feels now, no matter how cathartic the pulsing beats (courtesy of hitmeisters Max Martin and Dr. Luke) might feel, the ultimate end here is a very sad one indeed." [...] Priya Elan of NME panned the song: 'This is the part of me, that you're never going to take away from me,' [...] "she sings in that strange angry robot voice of hers. The sentiment, as ever, is punch you in face crystal clear and probably meant something to one of the (probably) 17 writers who wrote the song. As it stands, it's another de-humanised slab of radio pop from Perry INC." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{could hardly}} have believed, my dear Dorothea, that I should be so late in writing to you from Altruria, but you can easily believe that I am {{thoroughly}} ashamed of myself for my neglect. It is not for want of thinking of you, or talking of you, that I have seemed so much more ungrateful than I am. My husband and I seldom have any serious talk which doesn't somehow come round to you. He admires you and likes {{you as much as}} I do, and he does his best, poor man, to understand you; but his not understanding you is only a part of his general failure to understand how any American can be kind and good in conditions which he considers so abominable as those of the capitalistic world. He is not nearly so severe on us as he used to be at times when he was among us. When the other Altrurians are discussing us he often puts in a reason for us against their logic; and I think he has really forgotten, a good deal, <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> are with us, or else finds his own memory of them incredible. But his experience of the world outside his own country has taught him how to temper the passion of the Altrurians for justice with a tolerance of the unjust; and when they bring him to book on his own report of us he tries to explain us away, and show how we are not so bad as we ought to be.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper treats {{interest}} groups – {{people in their}} role as consumers of a public good and people in their role as taxpayers – as the unit of account for representative voting. Each group is allowed {{to make an effort}} to support its preferred candidate and, at the margin, the effort-benefit ratio is the political price the group is willing to pay to secure an additional dollar of benefits. Under reasonable assumptions, a unique equilibrium is assured and its characteristics are quite intuitive. In particular, the marginal political benefit (from consumers) of the last unit of output must equal the marginal political cost (from taxpayers). Alternatively, {{the rate at which the}} politician can transform taxpayer income into consumer surplus must equal the ratio of their political prices. The result will be optimal only on the rare occasion when the effort-benefit ratios of the two groups are equal. Since political goals are themselves “public goods ” for the two {{interest groups}}, they face all the normal free rider problems. Moreover, even small differences in the effort-benefit ratios of the two groups lead to large welfare losses. <b>How</b> <b>bad</b> can <b>things</b> get? Each group has an incentive to try to overcome free-rider prob...|$|R

[...] "Every honest man has a duty to the State, and it is {{certainly}} going to cost him more than he gains if he won't discharge it. There are probably more honest men than rogues everywhere, and yet one usually sees the rogues uppermost, for this reason: the honest man won't worry so long as they don't rob him, and his neighbour can't make a fight alone. Nobody is anxious to face the first blow {{for the benefit of the}} rest, and so the rogue gets bolder, until he becomes intolerable. Then the honest man stirs himself, and the rogues go down, though it causes ever so much more trouble than it would have done if the thing had been undertaken earlier. I'll give you an example.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the article {{is to provide a}} profile of Shaun Hunt. Design/methodology/approach: Shaun {{provides}} a short biographical description of his life. He is then interviewed by Jerome. Findings: Shaun tells us about the long journey of recovery that he has made {{to the point where he}} is now a University lecturer. Research limitations/implications: In large group studies the individual gets lost in statistical tables and the lived experience is absent. Single case studies provide us with stories to nurture and encourage us all. Practical implications: Shaun says that we often miss the obvious question in our interactions with people with lived experience. “What happened to you?” seems a simple but telling conversation opener. Social implications: As Shaun says there are some amazing people who work in mental health services, but they are the ones who spoke to him and not to a “schizophrenic. ” Originality/value: As Shaun also says, “Never, ever give up hope, no matter <b>how</b> dark and <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> become, there is always a way back. ...|$|R
60|$|During {{this time}} it was hard to say whether Lord Rotherwood was more of a comfort or a torment. He was {{attached}} to his cousin with all the ardour of his affectionate disposition, and not one day passed without his appearing at Beechcroft. At first it was always in the parlour at the parsonage that he took up his station, and waited till he could find some means of getting at Claude or his uncle, to hear the last report from them, and if possible to make Claude come out for a walk or ride with him. And once Mr. Mohun caught him standing just outside Mr. Devereux's door, waiting for an opportunity to make an entrance. He could not, or would not see why Mr. Mohun should allow Claude to run the risk of infection rather than himself, and thus he kept his mother in continual anxiety, and even his uncle could not feel by any means certain that he would not do something imprudent. At last a promise was extracted from him that he would not again enter the parsonage, but he would not gratify Lady Rotherwood so far as to abstain from going to Beechcroft, a place which she began to regard with horror. He now was almost constantly at the New Court, talking over the reports, and quite provoking Emily by never desponding, and never choosing to perceive <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>things</b> really were. Every day which was worse than the last {{was supposed to be the}} crisis, and every restless sleep that they heard of he interpreted into the beginning of recovery. At last, however, after ten days of suspense, the report began to improve, and Claude came to the New Court with a more cheerful face, to say that his cousin was munch better. The world seemed immediately to grow brighter, people went about with joyful looks, Lord Rotherwood declared that from the first he had known all would be well, and Lily began to hope that now she had been spared so heavy a punishment, it was a kind of earnest that other things would mend, that she had suffered enough. The future no longer hung before her in such dark colours as before Mr. Devereux's illness, though still the New Court was in no satisfactory state, and still she had reason to expect that her father and Eleanor would be disappointed and grieved. Thankfulness that Mr. Devereux was recovering, and that Claude had escaped the infection, made her once more hopeful and cheerful; she let the morrow take thought for the things of itself, rejoicing that it was not her business to make arrangements.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} Taiwan {{educational}} governments have indicated renewed principals {{in elementary and}} secondary schools. A lot of principals reported adding a number of specific major additions to their responsibilities referring to new initiatives in teacher appraisal, curriculum plans, school management, public image-building, school improvement, and multicultural programs. The current picture presents a serious problem if one considers the cumulative and over-increasing being placed on principals. One prominent {{view is that the}} principalship should be conceptualized as the principal’s risk or principal’s edges. According to Fullan(1997), “The nonrational world of the principal and <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> are <b>things</b> for the principal ”, Despite all the attention on the principal’s leadership role we appear to be losig ground, if we take as our measure of progress the declining presence of increasingly large numbers of highly effective, satisfied principals. As such, principal’s risk or edges are thought to mediate how information relevant to the principalship is encoded, organized, retrieved, and used in interactions with the environment as the basis for making “ judgements, decisions, inferences, or predictions about principals ”. One source of evidence for the principal’s edge view in Taiwan is about “How to empower school principal? ” and “ How do we make a good principal? ” In a typical principal’s task participants are presented a set of trait terms and are asked to make some decision about principal’s edge. One such decision {{is whether or not the}} trait is considered to be a good principal. The common finding is that traits processed with respec...|$|R
