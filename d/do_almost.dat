5|$|The Elves, {{particularly}} the Noldor, preoccupy themselves with various {{things such as}} smithwork, sculpture, music and other arts, and of course, what to eat. Males and females can <b>do</b> <b>almost</b> everything equally; however, the females often specialize in the arts of healing while the males go to war. This is {{because they believe that}} taking life interferes with the ability to preserve life. However, Elves are not stuck in rigid roles; females can defend themselves at need as well as males, and many males are skilled healers as well, such as Elrond.|$|E
5|$|The train {{doors were}} {{originally}} designed to be opened and closed automatically and the doors would re-open if an object blocked them, much as elevator doors <b>do.</b> <b>Almost</b> immediately after the system opened in 1976 Metro realized these features were not conducive to safe or efficient operation and they were disabled. At present the doors may be opened automatically or manually. If a door tries to close and it meets an obstruction, the operator must re-open the door.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I <b>do</b> <b>almost</b> always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E

25|$|Geary {{was also}} a capable lower order batsman who usually relied upon hitting, but could get runs with a quiet, if unstylish {{determination}} when they were desperately needed. Though he never scored a thousand runs - his best aggregates were 923 in 1929 and 900 in 1925 - his runs were frequently of great value to a county that never possessed any of the exceptionally high-class batsmen other counties could command in Geary's heyday. Owing to his considerable height and reach, Geary was an excellent slip catcher and, despite all the bowling he had to <b>do,</b> <b>almost</b> always his county's leading fielder.|$|E

Already this couple had lost three children {{in the hospital and}} so would not let these go, though I begged hard to take them out of the hot tent. I can't describe what it is to see these children lying about in a state of collapse. It’s just exactly like faded flowers thrown away.

25|$|The third tale, Guardian of the Solar System, {{finds the}} house and Sara finally separating. She trades places with a man named Robert, to whom she had told stories and granted wishes for many years. The trade, Robert's final wish, gives him the ability to <b>do</b> <b>almost</b> anything, {{although}} it necessitates sacrificing his body. Sara is suddenly reborn in {{a new version of}} her original body, albeit slightly older and with a thousand years of memories. However, she has no idea what happened to the real Sara after she left the house. This new Sara feels lost in this new world, so Robert grants her final wish. The TARDIS materializes in front of her; inside it, the Doctor (implied to be an incarnation other than the first) wonders what force dragged it down to Earth.|$|E
25|$|Many lodges were {{attached}} British Army regiments. The Moderns {{may have been}} wary of warranting lodges without a permanent address, so {{there was only one}} Grand Lodge of England warrant in the continental army from 1775–1777. The Antients and the Grand Lodge of Scotland were slightly better represented, but the overwhelming majority of regimental lodges held warrants from the Grand Lodge of Ireland. Thus it was that a group of African Americans, having been rejected by the lodges in Boston, were initiated into Lodge No 441 on the register of the Grand Lodge of Ireland, which was attached to the 38th Foot (later the 1st Staffordshire). These 15 men formed African Lodge No 1, as the British departed, leaving them a permit to <b>do</b> <b>almost</b> everything but admit new masons. Two of the members were seafarers, and obtained entrance to a lodge in London, being recognised as regularly initiated Masons. This enabled their master, Prince Hall, to apply to the Moderns for a charter, which was duly granted on 29 September 1784, now as African Lodge No 459. Such was the success of the lodge that it became a Provincial Grand Lodge, and Prince Hall the Provincial Grand Master. After his death, the provincial lodges reconstituted themselves as a grand lodge (African Grand Lodge), becoming Prince Hall Grand Lodge in 1847.|$|E

500|$|Cats {{have seven}} {{cervical}} vertebrae, as <b>do</b> <b>almost</b> all mammals; 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae like most mammals (humans have five); and a variable number of caudal vertebrae {{in the tail}} (humans retain three to five caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx). The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility. Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis. [...] Unlike human arms, cat forelimbs {{are attached to the}} shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head.|$|E
500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "County health {{officials}} {{acknowledge that the}} bacterial count {{at the mouth of}} the creek—which curls into a warm-water stagnant pond that flushes out onto the beach—is at times alarmingly high, often surpassing the legal limit for California. As a result, the area where the creek meets the sea, and the creek itself, are considered permanently off limits to swimmers and bear prominent signs that warn of the dangers of trespassing into such toxic waters. Nevertheless, people <b>do,</b> <b>almost</b> daily. Officials from the Orange County Environmental Health Department say that skin rashes, infections, [...] "pink eye" [...] and other assorted ailments are not uncommon to those who use Aliso Beach and, unwittingly, come in contact with the creek and its invisible bacteria...". The problems facing the creeks are blamed on urbanization, which has deprived the creeks of needed sediment while increasing pollution.|$|E

500|$|What was not {{publicly}} known {{during the regular}} season and playoffs was that Smith had torn his rotator cuff after suffering an impingement in his right shoulder during the July 11–14 homestand against the Padres. After suffering the impingement diving back into first base on a pickoff throw, Smith altered his throwing motion {{to such a degree that}} the rotator cuff tear subsequently developed. The 5'10" [...] (1.78m), 180-pound (82kg) Smith opted to forgo surgery and instead built up his arm strength via weightlifting, playing through whatever pain he encountered. Said Smith, [...] "I didn't tell anybody about the injury, because I wanted to keep playing and didn't want anybody thinking they could run on me or take advantage of the injury. I tried to <b>do</b> <b>almost</b> everything, except throw a baseball, left-handed: opening a door, turning on the radio—everything.
