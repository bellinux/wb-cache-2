60|$|One of the ablest recent {{supporters}} of the Volitional theory has furnished an explanation, at once historically true and philosophically acute, {{of the failure of}} the Greek philosophers in physical inquiry, in which, as I conceive, he unconsciously depicts his own state of mind. “Their stumbling-block was one as {{to the nature of the}} evidence they had to expect for their conviction.... They had not seized the idea that they must not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the processes of outward causes, but only their results; and consequently, the whole physical philosophy of the Greeks was an attempt to identify mentally the effect with its cause, to feel after some not only necessary but natural connection, where they meant by natural that which would per se carry some presumption to their own mind.... They wanted to see some reason why the physical antecedent should produce this particular consequent, and their only attempts were in directions where they could find such reasons.”(126) In other words, they were not content merely to know that one phenomenon was always followed by another; they thought that they had not attained the true aim of science, unless they could perceive something in the nature of the one phenomenon from which it might have been known or presumed previous to trial that it would be followed by the other: just what the writer, who has so clearly pointed out their error, thinks that he perceives in the nature of the phenomenon Volition. And to complete the statement of the case, he should have added that these early speculators not only made this their aim, but were quite satisfied with their success in it; not only sought for causes which should carry in their mere statement evidence of their efficiency, but fully believed that they had found such causes. The reviewer can see plainly that this was an error, because he does not believe that there exist any relations between material phenomena which can account for their producing one another; but the very fact of the persistency of the Greeks in this error, shows that their minds were in a very different state: they were able to derive from the assimilation of physical facts to other physical facts, the kind of mental satisfaction which we connect with the word explanation, and which the reviewer would have us think can only be found in referring phenomena to a will. When Thales and Hippo held that moisture was the universal cause, and external element, of which all other things were but the infinitely various sensible manifestations; when Anaximenes predicated the same thing of air, Pythagoras of numbers, and the like, they all thought that they had found a real explanation; and were content to rest in this explanation as ultimate. The ordinary sequences of the external universe appeared to them, no less than to their critic, to be inconceivable without the supposition of some universal agency to connect the antecedents with the consequents; but they did not think that Volition, exerted by minds, was the only agency which fulfilled this requirement. Moisture, or air, or numbers, carried to their minds a precisely similar impression of making intelligible what was otherwise inconceivable, and gave the same full satisfaction to the demands of their conceptive faculty.|$|E
50|$|In {{his quest}} to go beyond a {{descriptive}} account of the nervous system, Bullock studied many different and unrelated, species. He believed that this “comparative approach” would reveal both general principles of the nervous system, and offer insights into which nervous system properties (anatomical, physiological, and chemical) were relevant to observed differences in species-specific traits, as well as which specific traits were relevant to observed differences in nervous systems. His resulting discoveries helped explain various properties of nervous systems. In one influential review he wrote, “Comparative neuroscience is likely to reach insights so novel as to constitute revolutions in understanding the structure, functions, ontogeny, and evolution of nervous systems. … Without due consideration of the neural and behavioral correlates of differences between higher taxa and between closely related families, species, sexes , and stages, we cannot <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> nervous systems or ourselves”.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Stirling-matrices {{occur as}} other initimate and basic {{relatives}} of the ZV-(Vandermonde) matrix. Variants transform powerseries to exponentialseries and conversely. Using finite sizes they or their scaled variants give rational approximations to logarithms and exponentials. The most striking property for me is, that they are eigenmatrices of the Bernoullian-matrix Gp, which sums geometric series to zeta-type series of any like powers to any finite number of terms. Most of the formulae here are heuristic findings (although in the meantime I found most of the formulas in textbooks and online-references). The focus in my recent study was primarily at the binomial- and the Gp-matrix; but I <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> more details of these matrices when analyzing the Stirling-matrices intensely.

40|$|The {{vacuum of}} quantum fields {{contains}} correlated fluctuations. When restricted {{to one side}} of a surface these have a huge entropy of entanglement that scales with the surface area. If UV physics renders this entropy finite, then a thermodynamic argument implies the existence of gravity. That is, the causal structure of spacetime must be dynamical and governed by the Einstein equation with Newton's constant inversely proportional to the entropy density. Conversely, the existence of gravity makes the entanglement entropy finite. This thermodynamic reasoning is powerful despite the lack of {{a detailed description of the}} dynamics at the cutoff scale, but it has its limitations. In particular, we should not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> corrections to Einstein gravity in this way.
