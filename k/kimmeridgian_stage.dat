5|$|The type {{specimen}} of Coelurus agilis, YPM 2010 (now considered a synonym of Coelurus fragilis) was recovered in the Brushy Basin {{member of the}} Morrison Formation, in Albany County, Wyoming. The specimen was collected by Reed in gray sandstone and brown/green claystone that were deposited during the <b>Kimmeridgian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Jurassic period, approximately 157 to 152 million years ago. This specimen is housed {{in the collection of}} the Yale Peabody Museum in New Haven, Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|The {{material}} {{of the type}} species of Knoetschkesuchus, K. langenbergensis, comes from a marly limestone bed (numbered as Bed 83, not Bed 93 as reported by some publications) containing recrystallized micritic intraclasts, located within the Langenberg Quarry in the Harz Mountains near Goslar, Lower Saxony, Germany. These deposits have been dated to the Upper <b>Kimmeridgian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Jurassic - specifically, to the regional equivalent of the Upper Kimmeridgian known as the Mittleres Kimmeridge, and belong to the Süntel Formation. Although well-preserved, fossils from this quarry were recovered generally by regular blasting operations in the quarry.|$|E
5|$|Apatosaurus was {{the second}} most common sauropod in the Morrison Formation ecosystem, after Camarasaurus. Apatosaurus may have been more solitary than other Morrison Formation dinosaurs. Supersaurus has a greater total length and is the largest of all sauropods from the Morrison Formation. Apatosaurus fossils have only been found in the upper levels of the formation. Those of Apatosaurus ajax are known {{exclusively}} from the upper Brushy Basin Member, about 152–151 mya. A.louisae fossils are rare, known only from one site in the upper Brushy Basin Member; they date to the late <b>Kimmeridgian</b> <b>stage,</b> about 151mya. Additional Apatosaurus remains are known from similarly aged or slightly younger rocks, but they have not been identified as any particular species, and thus may instead belong to Brontosaurus.|$|E

500|$|Compsognathus {{is known}} from two almost {{complete}} skeletons, one from Germany that is [...] long and another from France that is [...] long. The physician and fossil collector Joseph Oberndorfer acquired the German specimen (BSP AS I 563) in 1859, discovered {{about the same}} year in the lithographic limestone deposits in the Riedenburg-Kelheim region of Bavaria, in the Jurassic part of a lagoonal region known as the Solnhofen archipelago. The limestone of this area has also yielded such well-preserved fossils as Archaeopteryx with feather impressions and some pterosaurs with imprints of their wing membranes. The German Compsognathus fossil itself most likely came from the Painten Formation of the Kapfelberg locality, specifically dated to the uppermost <b>Kimmeridgian</b> <b>stage</b> (150.8 million years ago); however, alternative possibilities include quarries near Jachenhausen or Goldberg, both from the Tithonian, to which stage Compsognathus has traditionally been dated. Johann A. Wagner discussed the specimen briefly in 1859, when he coined the name Compsognathus longipes, and described it in detail in 1861. In early 1868, Thomas Huxley compared the two species and, following earlier suggestions by Karl Gegenbaur and Edward Drinker Cope, concluded that, apart from its arms and feathers, the Archaeopteryx skeleton was closely similar to Compsognathus, and that the proto-bird {{was related to the}} dinosaurs. In 1896, Othniel Marsh recognized the fossil as a true member of the Dinosauria. John Ostrom thoroughly redescribed the species in 1978, {{making it one of the}} best-known small theropods at that time. The German specimen is on display at the Bayerische Staatsammlung für Paläontologie und historische Geologie (Bavarian State Institute for Paleontology and Historical Geology) in Munich, Germany, which bought the fossil from Oberndorfer in 1865.|$|E

500|$|Coelurus ( [...] ) is a genus of coelurosaurian dinosaur {{from the}} Late Jurassic period (mid-late <b>Kimmeridgian</b> faunal <b>stage,</b> 153150million years ago). The name means [...] "hollow tail", {{referring}} to its hollow tail vertebrae (Greek κοιλος, koilos = hollow + ουρα, oura = tail). Although its name {{is linked to}} one of the main divisions of theropods (Coelurosauria), it has historically been poorly understood, and sometimes confused with its better-known contemporary Ornitholestes. Like many dinosaurs studied {{in the early years of}} paleontology, it has had a confusing taxonomic history, with several species being named and later transferred to other genera or abandoned. Only one species is currently recognized as valid: the type species, C. fragilis, described by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1879. It is known from one partial skeleton found in the Morrison Formation of Wyoming, United States. It was a small bipedal carnivore with elongate legs.|$|R

5000|$|Archaeopterodactyloidea (meaning [...] "ancient Pterodactyloidea") is an extinct clade of pterodactyloid pterosaurs {{from the}} middle Late Jurassic to the latest Early Cretaceous (<b>Kimmeridgian</b> to Albian <b>stages)</b> of Africa, Asia and Europe. It was named by Alexander Wilhelm Armin Kellner in 1996 as the group that {{contains}} Germanodactylus, Pterodactylus, the Ctenochasmatidae and the Gallodactylidae. In 2003, Kellner defined the clade as a node-based taxon consisting of the last common ancestor of Pterodactylus, Ctenochasma and Gallodactylus and all its descendants. Although phylogenetic analyses that based on David Unwin's 2003 analysis do not recover monophyletic Archaeopterodactyloidea, phylogenetic analyses that based on Kellner's analyses, or the analyses of Brian Andres (2008, 2010, in press) recover monophyletic Archaeopterodactyloidea {{at the base of}} the Pterodactyloidea.|$|R
50|$|Pliosaurus (meaning 'more lizard') is an extinct genus of thalassophonean pliosaurid {{known from}} the <b>Kimmeridgian</b> and Tithonian <b>stages</b> (Late Jurassic) of Europe and South America. Their diet would have {{included}} fish, cephalopods, and marine reptiles. This genus has contained many species {{in the past but}} recent reviews found only six to be valid, while the validity of two additional species awaits a petition to the ICZN. Pliosaurus currently consists of the type species P. brachydeirus, and also P. brachyspondylus, P. carpenteri, P. funkei, P. kevani, P. macromerus, P. rossicus and P. westburyensis, as well as the invalid P. portentificus. Most species of Pliosaurus are notable for their large body size, while the others, P. brachydeirus, P. brachyspondylus and P. portentificus, are known exclusively from immature individuals. Species of this genus are differentiated from other pliosaurids based on seven autapomorphies, including teeth that are triangular in cross section.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} 40 years, the {{stratigraphy}} of the Upper Jurassic of Europe has received much attention and considerable revision; {{much of the}} impetus behind this endeavour has stemmed {{from the work of}} the International Subcommission on Jurassic Stratigraphy. The Upper Jurassic Series consists of three <b>stages,</b> the Oxfordian, <b>Kimmeridgian</b> and Tithonian which are further subdivided into substages, zones and subzones, primarily on the basis of ammonites. Regional variations between the Mediterranean, Submediterranean and Subboreal provinces are discussed and correlation possibilities indicated. The durations of the Oxfordian, <b>Kimmeridgian</b> and Tithonian <b>Stages</b> are reported to have been 5. 3, 3. 4 and 6. 5 Ma, respectively. This review of the present status of Upper Jurassic stratigraphy aids identification of a number of problems of subdivision and definition of Upper Jurassic stages; in particular these include correlation of the base of the Kimmeridgian and the top of the Tithonian between Submediterranean and Subboreal Europe. Although still primarily based on ammonite stratigraphy, subdivision of the Upper Jurassic is increasingly being refined by the incorporation of other fossil groups; these include both megafossils, such as aptychi, belemnites, bivalves, gastropods, brachiopods, echinoderms, corals, sponges and vertebrates, and microfossils such as foraminifera, radiolaria, ciliata, ostracodes, dinoflagellates, calcareous nannofossils, charophyaceae, dasycladaceae, spores and pollen. Important future developments will depend on the detailed integration of these disparate biostratigraphic data and their precise combination with the abundant new data from sequence stratigraphy, utilising the high degree of stratigraphic resolution offered by certain groups of fossils. This article also contains some notes on the recent results of magnetostratigraphy and sequence chronostratigraphy...|$|R
5000|$|Monkonosaurus (meaning [...] "Monkon lizard") is {{a dubious}} genus of herbivorous stegosaurian dinosaur from the Late Jurassic (<b>Kimmeridgian</b> <b>stage,</b> around 150-155 million years ago) of Tibet (and the {{cretaceous}} Lura Formation in China).
