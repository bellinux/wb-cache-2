25|$|The first Richard and Linda Thompson album, <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>the</b> Bright Lights Tonight, was {{recorded}} in May 1973 in short time and on a small budget. Largely because of the petrol shortage in Britain {{and its impact on}} the availability of vinyl for records, Bright Lights was held back by Island Records for nearly a year before being released in April 1974. The album was well received by the critics, though sales were less than stellar.|$|E
25|$|It was not {{apparent}} from their records at first, but the Thompsons had embraced an esoteric Sufi strand of Islam in early 1974. <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>the</b> Bright Lights Tonight was recorded before this conversion, but released some time afterwards. The songs {{for the second}} Richard and Linda album, Hokey Pokey, were similarly written some time ahead of the album's recording and eventual release. It was Pour Down Like Silver, with its cover photo of a turbaned Richard Thompson gazing out at the world, that tipped the public off to the Thompsons' growing preoccupation with their faith.|$|E
500|$|Though [...] "outwardly nerveless", {{according}} to military historian Patrick Bishop, Shannon was {{not immune to}} dread feelings. As they prepared to depart {{on one of their}} night missions, Cheshire commented on the beautiful sunset, to which Shannon replied, [...] "I don't give a fuck about that, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> sunrise". Having been raised to acting squadron leader, he was awarded a bar to his DSO on 26September 1944 for [...] "courage of high order on numerous sorties".

The Portland Youth Jazz Orchestra All Stars plays Ward's [...] "One Life Away" [...] as an [...] "old-timey instrumental" [...] for one of Mercer's dreams, an homage to a dancing {{sequence}} seen in Jean-Luc Godard's 1964 film Bande à part. For the closing credits, Ward and Zooey Deschanel recorded a duet cover of [...] "When I Get to the Border" [...] from Richard and Linda Thompson's 1974 album <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>the</b> Bright Lights Tonight. The pair found themselves [...] "mutually charmed", according to The New York Times Melena Ryzik, and bonded over similar musical interests. After Ward listened to Deschanel's demos, they paired up and formed the band She & Him. Pitchfork Media reported in April 2007 of a future The Go-Getter soundtrack to be released by Merge Records, including a 12-song tracklist, but Merge later claimed that it was never planning to release a soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|Talking {{about her}} {{feelings}} {{when she got}} the part, Bell expressed, [...] "Since I was 4 years old, I dreamed {{of being in a}} Disney animated film," [...] she said. [...] "It was the first goal I ever set for myself. It seemed like {{it would be a very}} unrealistic one." [...] She described Disney movies as [...] "the ones [...] watched over and over again when [...] was a kid," [...] and continued, [...] "I knew every line from The Little Mermaid. I love Aladdin. When asked about her favorite Disney character, Bell said, [...] "Ariel from The Little Mermaid. Because I think it was a shift that Disney had, where a female lead—the [...] "princess," [...] I guess—didn't just want to find her mate. She was singing [...] "I want to be where the people are. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> world. I want to venture outside my comfort zone."" [...] Bell described her initial reaction when she first found that she was cast as [...] "I was in glee". Lee admitted Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened a couple of vocal tracks from The Little Mermaid, including [...] "Part of Your World" [...] that the actress recorded when she was young, stating that without these recordings, it would've been very difficult to the find the right one to play Anna.|$|E
2500|$|More than 2000 people {{gathered}} {{to watch the}} burning prefectural office, but no one dared to extinguish the fire. They {{were looking at the}} burning office absentmindedly, thinking of the future of Japan, according to a newspaper. Another document recorded that people who had endured the government policy and Mabiki sokai (forced evacuation of houses), shouted, [...] "This is the Heaven's punishment against the evacuation of my house, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> face of those who performed the bad policy {{in the name of the}} emperor." [...] The force of fire was strong and fearful; the prefectural office was on the other side of Matsue O-hashi bridge, but a housewife stated she had felt that the fire would come to the other side of the bridge.|$|E

6000|$|He paused.

2500|$|Drummond later {{took a job}} in the {{mainstream}} music business as an A consultant for the label WEA working with Strawberry Switchblade and Brilliant. In July 1986, on his 33 and a third birthday, Drummond repented his corporate involvement and resigned his job by way of a [...] "ringingly quixotic press release": [...] "I will be 33.5 (sic) years old in September, a time for a revolution in my life. There is a mountain to climb the hard way, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> world from the top..." [...] (In an interview in December 1990, Drummond recalled spending half a million pounds at WEA on the band Brilliant– for whom he envisioned massive worldwide success– only for them to completely flop.

2500|$|In 1986, Bill Drummond was an {{established}} figure within the British music industry, having co-founded Zoo Records, played guitar in the Liverpool band Big in Japan, {{and worked as}} manager of Echo & the Bunnymen and the Teardrop Explodes. On 21 July of that year, he resigned from his position as an A man at record label WEA, citing that he was nearly 33⅓ years old (33⅓ revolutions per minute being significant to Drummond as {{the speed at which}} a vinyl LP revolves), and that it was [...] "time for a revolution in my life. There is a mountain to climb the hard way, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> world from the top". He released a well-received solo LP, The Man, judged by reviewers as [...] "tastefully understated," [...] a [...] "touching if idiosyncratic biographical statement" [...] encapsulating [...] "his bizarrely sage ruminations", and [...] "a work of humble genius: the best kind".|$|E
