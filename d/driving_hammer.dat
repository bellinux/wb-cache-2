50|$|Wave {{equation}} {{analysis is}} a numerical {{method of analysis}} for the behavior of driven foundation piles. It predicts the pile capacity versus blow count relationship (bearing graph) and pile driving stress. The model mathematically represents the pile <b>driving</b> <b>hammer</b> and all its accessories (ram, cap, and cap block), {{as well as the}} pile, as a series of lumped masses and springs in a one-dimensional analysis. The soil response for each pile segment is modeled as viscoelastic-plastic. The method was first developed in the 1950s by E.A. Smith of the Raymond Pile Driving Company.|$|E

The cracked concrete is modeled as water saturated porous media, where the cracked region is given a high permeability. A FE program based on a coupled hydro-mechanical theory has been developed to perform simulations. The simulations clearly demonstrate the water pumping phenomenon, where water is pressed out from the crack by the compressive wave induced by the pile <b>driving</b> <b>hammer,</b> and then sucked back again by the following tensile wave. Further, the principal tensile stress distribution indicates that further cracking is likely to occur at {{the surface of the}} pile around the crack, which is in agreement with the damages seen on piles in reality...|$|E

The {{observations}} and tests under small scale in 1 -gravity condition {{are intended to}} obtain a comparative behavior of a model and prototype of geotechnical case by imposing the scaling relations.

To simulate pile loading test (PLT) on clay, the following models of: clay, pile, driving simulation and procedure of PLT based on ASTM D 4410 were set-up. The PLT in reduced scale environment was then followed by performing normal practice of full scale PLT in original clay site. Load settlement curves obtained from both “pile loading test ” in small and full scale simulations showed closely good agreement.

40|$|The {{response}} {{of a table}} {{to the impact of}} its <b>driving</b> <b>hammer</b> in the highly accelerated life test (HALT) system depends on, among other things, the location of the hammer, the presence of multiple hammers, and the angle at which the hammer is mounted to the table. The present study investigated the {{response of}} a table to a variety of impacts from different combinations of hammers. It began with a theoretical analysis of the forces of impact exerted by hammers which led to the calculation of the corresponding displacement. These theoretical calculations revealed the mechanics of the HALT system to help explain the working principles behind this complex system. Then a simulation model was built to check the accuracy of the theoretical results. Finally, the accelerations of a table in a real HALT system were measured. These data showed good agreement with the experimental results and computer simulation. The responses of HALT systems have not been investigated thoroughly to date. The current study can help equipment designers and end users better understand the working principles of this kind of systems. It can be considered a breakthrough in terms of improving the performance of reliability testing with this kind of system...|$|E
40|$|Driving piles {{constitute}} {{a large portion}} of the high-capacity foundations used today. They transfer structural loads to deep bearing strata when adequate surficial soils are not available. The mechanisms required to install these piles generally consist of a hammer, hammer lead, a crane, and various support rigging. This study focused on lead sections, specifically, one which was manufactured by Berminghammer Foundation Equipment, Inc. The dimensions and strength of a lead section must be capable of supporting both the pile <b>driving</b> <b>hammer</b> and the longest anticipated pile for a given site. The strength of the section must be capable of withstanding hundreds of tons in compression and bending. If the lead is operated in a batter, (tilted forward, backward, or sideways) the weight of the hammer and pile causes much more bending than the vertical orientation. The cross-section details for these long steel sections vary from design to design but usually incorporate some form of bolt group, pins, and steel alignment dowels. This thesis focuses on the design, modeling, and testing of such a connection. The motivation of the study stems from a company-wide incentive to standardize the connections used to splice the Berminghammer C 15 -series lead section. In an effort to verify a proposed connection design, Berminghammer Foundation Engineering solicited the University of South Florida to test a full-sized lead section to failure, while monitoring the splice-connection performance...|$|E

5000|$|A player piano is a {{modified}} piano that [...] "plays itself". The piano keys move {{according to a}} pattern of holes punched in an unwinding scroll. Unlike a music synthesizer, the instrument actually produces the sound itself, with the keys moving up and down, <b>driving</b> <b>hammers</b> that strike the strings. Like its counterpart, a player piano can be played by hand as well. When a scroll is run through the instrument, the movement of its keys produce the illusion that an invisible performer is playing the instrument. Vonnegut uses the player piano as a metaphor to represent how even the most simple of activities, such as teaching oneself {{how to play the}} piano in one's spare time, has been replaced by machines instead of people. Early in the book, Paul Proteus's friend and future member of the Ghost Shirt Society, Ed Finnerty, is shown manually playing a player piano, suggesting the idea of humans reclaiming their animus from the machines.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{hydraulic}} pile <b>driving</b> <b>hammers</b> to overcome energy losses during freefall enables {{a greater proportion}} of the impact energy to be transferred to the pile in comparison to diesel hammers. This percentage, termed the energy transfer ratio, is not routinely measured in practice however, and {{there is an element of}} uncertainty regarding appropriate energy transfer ratios to assume in driveability analyses. In light of such uncertainties, the energy transfer ratios of four- and five-tonne hydraulic hammers were assessed during installation of driven cast-in-situ piles at several sites in the United Kingdom. The piling rigs were fitted with instrumentation which enabled measurement of the hammer velocity (and hence kinetic energy) at impact for each blow during installation, with the corresponding magnitude of energy transferred to the closed-ended steel installation tube ascertained using a Pile Driving Analyser. The results of the study showed that energy transfer ratios were strongly dependent on the hammer drop height, with transfer ratios of 95 % advocated by the pile hammer manufacturer only achievable when a drop height in excess of about 600 mm was used. As such, lower energy transfer ratios may need to be considered in driveability predictions for these pile types (i. e. steel or DCIS piles) if lower drop heights are used during driving. Further research is required to substantiate limited data suggesting that soil type may also be influential...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} the wave equation {{to the problem of}} selecting a <b>driving</b> <b>hammer</b> for prestressed concrete piles. The potentially damaging effects of these types of hammers on various prestressed concrete piles were analyzed by means of parametric studies carried out on a hypothetical group of problems and two case histories. A computer program written by T. C. Edwards and largely {{based on the work of}} E. A. L. Smith was used to analyze the driving stresses produced in the pile by driving it with steam-air hammers. For each hammer the variation of driving stresses in the pile due to variations of cushion characteristics, soil resistance, depth of embedment, length of pile and variations in the soil properties was studied. Throughout the study it was seen that the tensile stresses produced by a single acting hammer were much higher than corresponding stresses produced by a double acting hammer of the same energy with a heavier ram. The velocity of impact of the ram was found to be of major significance in determining the magnitude of the driving stresses. Finally, it was seen that although there was a close interaction between the pile-soil-cushion system and hammer that no absolute conclusion can be made regarding the suitability of a certain hammer for all piles, Each situation should be considered individually on the basis of a similar approach to the one followed in this study...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{measurement}} of {{dry bulk density}} is critical for determining stocks of elements such as carbon or nitrogen, in soils. During investigations of changes of soil carbon with time, we resampled soil profiles for bulk density using two methods, namely the <b>driving</b> <b>hammer</b> method and the carving method. The carving method involves gently pressing a metal ring down into a carved pedestal of soil while the hammer method uses percussion to insert a metal ring {{into the top of}} a soil layer. We consider the carving method to be more accurate because the soils are less disturbed using carving. The hammer method generally underestimated bulk density by about 5 % in comparison with the carving method – depending on soil order and horizon. Most of the bulk density data in the New Zealand National Soils Database (originally collected in moist soils for water release characterisation) were obtained with the hammer method and can now be corrected to the equivalent of data obtained by carving. With data from 44 soil profiles comprising 388 horizons, we showed that a greater correction is needed for soils in the Allophanic (+ 10 %) and Melanic soil orders than for other soil orders. The Brown Soils were separated from the remaining soils and a correction factor of about + 9 % was required for their A and AB horizons and + 3 % for their subsoil horizons. The remaining soils required a correction factor of + 6 % for their A and AB horizons and + 3. 5 % for their subsoil horizons. The correction factor for the A horizons for the Allophanic Soils was similar to their subsoil horizons, suggesting that the influence of aluminium and allophane was overriding that of soil carbon. The Melanic Soils required a correction factor of + 13 % for their A horizons but their subsoil horizons responded differently to other soils possibly because of high smectite contents. These differences in bulk density, attributed to change in sampling method, were often greater than changes in soil carbon that would be considered important. Although we used New Zealand soils, we believe that our conclusions will apply to many soils world-wide because most of our soils have equivalents within the FAO and USDA systems of soil classification. This study shows the importance of assessing bulk density methodology, and the possible need for other workers to amend the carbon stocks calculated from the hammer method...|$|E
40|$|Modeling {{pile driving}} {{is a complex}} process, {{including}} vibrations generated from the <b>driving</b> <b>hammer,</b> propagating further through the pile and transferred to the surroundings at the pile-soil interface. The vibrations propagating through the ground interact with structures, potentially causing damage to both underground and structures at surface level or potentially disturbing their inhabitants. Prediction models of ground vibrations focus on estimating the vibrations at ground surface level. The prediction of vibration amplitude at different depths can be more useful at sites with sensitive ground conditions. A model predicting these subsurface vibrations, easily applicable in engineering practice is currently not available or not validated. One of the impediments in developing a model for predicting ground vibrations at different depths {{is the lack of}} field data for validation. The purpose of this thesis is to find a prediction model for ground vibrations at different depths below the surface level. The study is focused on vibrations induced by impact driving of open ended steel tubular piles. A literature study was conducted to gain theoretical knowledge on pile driving and ground vibrations. The model developed by Massarsch and Fellenius [15] was found in the literature and although it predicts ground vibrations at surface level, the adaptation of the model for predicting vibrations at different depths was studied. Vibration measurements from the field test performed in the Caland Canal have been analyzed. The soil profile at the site consists of sandy clay and clay layers overlying a dense sand layer. First, large diameter dolphin piles were driven by a vibratory hammer. When the pile toe reached the dense sand layer, the driving process was changed to impact hammering in order to change the characteristics of the vibrations transmitted through the soil. The pile driving was extensively monitored and particle velocities were recorded by 3 D geophones placed up to depths of NAP - 22 m (9. 50 m embedment depth). The prediction model of Massarsch and Fellenius [15] makes a distinction between the velocities of different wave types emitted from piles during impact driving. These waves are the shear waves propagating with a cylindrical wave front along the pile shaft and compression waves emitted at the pile toe, propagating with a spherical wave front. Surface waves resulting from wave reflection at ground surface are not considered in this thesis, as this research focuses on vibrations at different depths. Wave velocities are calculated from the hammer input energy, taking into account ground conditions and considering the vibration transmission efficacy which defines the amount of energy transmitted at the pile-soil interface. The model is adapted for open ended tubular piles. Due to the large diameter of the dolphin piles and the present soil conditions, the soil plugging effect and its contribution to dynamic soil resistance at the pile toe are ignored. Dynamic soil resistance at the pile toe is considered the source of spherical waves, while the soil resistance along the pile shaft is the source of cylindrical waves. The ratio between the pile cross section and the total area delimited by the external diameter is taken into account when calculating the dynamic soil resistance at the pile toe, resulting particle velocities of spherical waves smaller than unity. Therefore the cylindrical waves propagating from the pile shaft are considered the main source of ground vibrations. The results of the prediction model have been compared to vibration values measured in the field test. The predicted vibration amplitudes are a good approximation of the vibration levels measured in the sandy clay and clay layers. The predicted vibrations are of higher magnitude compared to the amplitude of vibrations recorded by the sensors placed in the dense sand layer.

50|$|The {{friction}} pile driving process starts by laying the grout shoe {{at the proper}} location and inserting the spigot end of the pile shaft into the conical point.

The breaker <b>hammer</b> <b>driving</b> tool is fitted with a special grout box adapter to allow the grout to flow from the grout pump through the driving tool down into the upper most pile shaft. The pumping rate of the grout should slightly exceed the take rate of the grout. In softer soils the grout takes tend to be higher due to outward bulging of the grout column.|$|R

40|$|AbstractDriving {{energy was}} {{measured}} in a standard penetration test (SPT) and 12 types of dynamic cone penetration tests (DCPTs) having different configurations for the <b>hammer,</b> <b>driving</b> rod, anvil and cone tip. The driving energy transferred from the free falling <b>hammer</b> to the <b>driving</b> rod was estimated from the measurements of strain and acceleration below the anvil. Basically, the driving energy was estimated for 21 successive blows {{in order to obtain}} the mean value, the standard deviation (σ) and the coefficient of variance (COV) in the SPT and DCPTs. The dynamic cone resistance, qdyn, was estimated from the driving energy, the corresponding set per blow, and masses of the hammer and the total rods. Thus, the estimated dynamic cone resistance was compared with the static cone resistance, qt, from a cone penetration test (CPT). The main objective of this report is to provide information on the driving efficiency in the SPT and each DCPT. The mean values for ef in the tests ranged from 52 % to 76 %. The values of COV for ef ranged from 0. 024 to 0. 265. Even though the test results are limited, the dynamic cone resistance, qt, estimated from the dynamic measurements were relatively good measures of the cone resistance from the CPT, showing the importance of the dynamic measurement in the SPT and DCPTs. In addition, possible factors influencing the driving efficiency, such as the hammer mass, the configuration of the driving rod (solid or hollow), the ratio of the diameter of the anvil and the diameter of the hammer, and the existence of a cushion or cushions between the anvil and the hammer, are discussed {{on the basis of the}} limited test results...|$|R
40|$|Wave {{equation}} analysis programs (WEAP) such as GRLWEAP and TNOWave {{were primarily}} developed for pre-driving analysis. They {{can also be}} used for post-driving measurement applications with some refinements. In the case of pre-driving analysis, the programs are used for the purpose of selecting the right equipment for a given ground condition and controlling stresses during pile driving processes. Recently, the program is increasingly used for the post-driving measurement application, where an assessment based on a variety of input parameters such as <b>hammer,</b> <b>driving</b> system and dynamic behaviour of soil is carried out. The process of this type of analysis is quite simple and it is performed by matching accurately known parameters, such as from CAPWAP analysis, to the parameters used in GRLWEAP analysis. The parameters that are refined in the typical analysis are pile stresses, hammer energy, capacity, damping and quakes. Matching of these known quantities by adjusting hammer, cushion and soil parameters in the wave equation program results in blow counts or sets and stresses for other hammer energies and capacities and cushion configuration. The result of this analysis is output on a Bearing Graph that establishes a relationship between ultimate capacity and net set per blow. A further application of this refinement method {{can be applied to the}} assessment of dynamic formulae, which are extensively used in pile capacity calculation during pile driving process. In this paper, WEAP analysis is carried out to establish the relationship between the ultimate capacities and sets using the various parameters and using this relationship to recalibrate the dynamic formula. The results of this analysis presented show that some of the shortcoming of the dynamic formula can be overcome and the results can be improved by the introduction of a correction factor...|$|R
