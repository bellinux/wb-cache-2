40|$|Background: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} the effect of the location of the rotational center and the morphology of teeth resulting in interference with the rotational path of insertion and to estimate when an <b>interference</b> <b>test</b> should be performed. Methods: A total of 400 dental radiograms of maxillary and mandibular first and second molars (100 for each position) were selected. The radiograms were used to hand-sketch the outlines on tracing paper. Then, an <b>interference</b> <b>test</b> was simulated using calipers. Mesial long occlusal rest seats with three different lengths were designed. A curve-simulated rotational path was drawn on the tracing paper showing the outline of a molar. If the curve was intersected by the mesial outline, interference was occurred. A total of 1200 tests were performed. Results: A significant number of interference cases (18. 5 %, N =  400) occurred when the rotational center was placed at the most distal margin of the occlusal surface. The interference was reduced (2. 75 %, N =  400) but still present at the distal fourth of the occlusal surface. At the distal one-third of the occlusal surface, interference did not occur (0 %, N =  400). There was {{a significant difference between the}} results of the three rotational centers (p <  0. 0001).

40|$|Presently, {{more and}} more water {{injection}} wells operate under induced fracturing condition. Induced fractures geometry and their orientation {{with respect to the}} injection well and nearby production wells are crucial factors in determining water injection performance. Designing, conducting and interpreting well tests is a possible way to understand geometry and dynamic behavior of induced fractures. Integrating nearby wells into well testing may give a possibility to characterize induced fracture geometry and its impact on macroscopic sweep efficiency. In this thesis, one of the objectives is getting knowledge on pressure transient responses of wells connected with fractures with different geometries and orientations using numerical simulations and analytical models. Two scenarios of well tests including single-well <b>tests</b> and <b>interference</b> <b>tests</b> were simulated with two well geometries (vertical and horizontal) and two induced fracture orientations (parallel and perpendicular to the well). Base cases without fracture were simulated and compared with cases including induced fractures. The numerical simulation included injection periods and shut-in periods with similar durations. Synthetic responses generated by the numerical simulation were compared with well test responses from equivalent analytical models. Comparison between the results of all fracture cases for single-well <b>tests</b> and also <b>interference</b> <b>tests</b> were performed and subsequently used to analyse differences in pressure transient responses. Moreover, a comparison of the results of numerical simulations with analytical models was carried out and confirmed capabilities of analytical models in interpreting pressure responses from many cases with various well and fracture geometries. The analysis of single-well test simulations confirmed that the case with parallel and perpendicular induced fractures intersecting a horizontal well has identical pressure transient responses to the case of induced fracture intersecting a vertical well for cases with high or infinite conductivity. On the other hand, interpretations of the synthetic pressure response generated by simulations of well <b>interference</b> <b>tests</b> indicated different responses in the case with parallel and perpendicular induced fractures: the pressure response to the active well shut-in (or start of injection) was registered later in the observation well in the case of parallel fracture. Therefore, it was confirmed that <b>interference</b> <b>tests</b> can give more information about fracture orientation than single-well tests. Finally, it was shown the value of interpretations of synthetic pressure transients in understanding induced fracture geometry and suggesting a well test design for the field application...|$|R

40|$|<b>Interference</b> <b>test</b> {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a valuable technique for evaluating reservoir properties such as permeability thickness and storativity over an area where active and observation wells are located. <b>Interference</b> <b>test</b> can also provide qualitative indications of reservoir heterogenities and communication between two or more wells. The availability of sophisticated pressure recorders encourages providing reliable data and improved accuracy. <b>Interference</b> <b>test</b> of Sibayak geothermal field that {{has been carried out}} in December 1998 to September 1999 is examined to prove two major fault which are predicted supporting permeability of this area. The presence of linear boundary can be determined by using a new semi-log type curve matching (Sageev et al, 1985).

The first test that conducted by measuring SBY- 8 response to SBY- 5 discharge, does not reflect presenting of either fault F 4 or F 1. The second test of well SBY- 7 response to SBY- 5 discharge, indicates shifting of the pressure response to the constant pressure linear boundary curve. It is shown in a log-log plot matching (Theis curve) and more clearly in new semi-log.

The various types of language transfer are also stated in the first chapter and a thorough analysis in relation to how and when language transfer occurs is provided. The second chapter involves a definition of contextual grammar and its role and function regarding negative transfer as well as a detailed account of the use of verb tenses in both English and Greek and consequently states and classifies the differences in verb tense use between the two languages that could originate negative transfer in L 2 performance. The third chapter refers to the reasons and criteria for the verb tense <b>interference</b> <b>test</b> design and implementation and presents the negative transfer error classification system which has been established and applied throughout the L 2 data analysis process.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Hydraulic pulse {{interference}} tests {{involve a}} cyclic injection of fluid into the source well, and by high precision {{measurement of the}} pressure pulse in a neighboring well, detailed hydraulic characterization between wells can be made. The pulse <b>interference</b> <b>test</b> is highly sensitive to hydrogeological properties between the pulse source and receiver wells. The transient nature of the test, involving the time delay and attenuation of the hydraulic pulse, enables the formation’s complete hydraulic properties to be computed. The advantages of the pulse <b>interference</b> <b>test</b> are the short duration of the test, the high resolution and directional characterization data obtained, {{and the lack of}} any generated contaminated groundwater. The hydraulic pulse <b>interference</b> <b>test</b> is ideal for characterizing a site for groundwater remediation systems such as iron permeable reactive barriers and accelerated bioremediation injection systems. The hydraulic conductivity of the site formation and the hydraulic connectivity between wells are of utmost importance when designing such systems. Hydraulic pulse interference tests are presented for two case histories; one involving a subsurface iron permeable reactive barrier in a sand and gravel deposit, and the second for a accelerated bioremediation injection system in a fractured basalt bedrock overlain by a sand, gravel and clay glacial deposit. The pulse interference data are presented as pressure time histories and interpreted by type curve analyses for both the porous media and fractured bedrock sites. Data from these hydraulic pulse interference tests were utilized directly in the design of both remediation systems, the iron permeable reactive barrier and the accelerated bioremediation injection system...|$|E

Participants were 64 undergraduate students (female, n = 38; male, n = 26), {{with a mean age of}} 19. 88 years. Results of canonical correlation analysis, including subtests of the WJ-III-Cog and scores from the D-KEFS, indicated a significant model with a canonical correlation value of. 57 and a canonical R 2 of 0. 33. All WJ-III-Cog and D-KEFS variables were associated with their canonical variates. Numbers Reversed from the WJ-III-Cog and Color-Word <b>Interference</b> <b>Test</b> Condition 3 (Inhibition) from the D-KEFS had the highest correlations with their canonical variates, implicating these tests as important contributors to {{the relationship}}. Linear regression analysis indicated a significant model in which Verbal Comprehension, Numbers Reversed, Sound Blending, Visual-Auditory Learning, Visual Matching, Spatial Relations, and Concept Formation as predictor variables account for approximately 23. 4 % of the variance in the Color-Word <b>Interference</b> <b>Test</b> Condition 3 (Inhibition) score. The results overall suggest that despite a clear relationship between executive function and cognitive ability, much variance between the D-KEFS and WJ-III-Cog remains unaccounted for. This study may be considered an appropriate preliminary analysis of the relationship between intelligence and executive functioning using these measures, though future research with additional populations is suggested.
