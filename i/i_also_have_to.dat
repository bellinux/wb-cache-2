5000|$|I have to {{say that}} the prose in this book often reads as if it were written, or maybe dictated, in a great hurry. There is some {{unnecessary}} repetition, and many paragraphs spend more time than they should on digressions that seem to have occurred to the author in mid-thought. If not exactly chiseled, the prose is nevertheless lively, readable, and plainspoken. The haste may have been justified by the pace of the events he aims to describe and explain.

5000|$|In late 2015, Robinson {{signed a}} new record {{contract}} with Eagle Rock Entertainment, who would be releasing the album he planned to release in 2016. As {{part of the deal}} between the two, Eagle Rock agreed to re-release Robinson's back catalog, beginning with Paper on February 26, 2016. This proved to be somewhat of a challenge for Robinson, as the master tapes for the album had been significantly damaged during Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. As a result, all of Robinson's original vocal tracks had been erased. Thus, Robinson was forced to return to the studio and re-record his vocals in order to reissue the album on schedule. [...] "At first I was like, 'Oh, shit. While I'm making my new record <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> re-sing Paper?'" [...] Robinson told Billboard magazine in 2016.

5000|$|His {{appointment}} as Group Chief Executive took effect on 1 June 2003. Shortly afterwards, in October 2003, HSBC {{announced that it}} would offshore the work done by its UK finance processing centres in Birmingham, Sheffield, Brentwood and Swansea to India, Malaysia and China within two years. The move, which represented the largest such offshoring in the financial services sector at that time and would lead to the loss of 4,000 British jobs, led the UK trade union UNIFI to warn Green that the [...] "gloves were off". He defended the decision, telling The Guardian’s Jill Treanor: “If you are a responsible company like us we do need to think about this on a global basis. We have to approach this in a responsible and human way. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> bear in mind {{that people are going to}} get jobs in India (and elsewhere). It's wrong to pretend you can protect the existing jobs and wrong to pretend there isn't going to be change. It can't be the right response to say that emerging markets have no right to jobs." [...] He added: “Cost minimisation cannot be the only driver of this. There is no way we want to jeopardise the quality of customer service”. Green also oversaw HSBC’s acquisition of Household International, a US subprime lender, as well as its integration into the parent company. He later came to regret the deal, which was the largest acquisition in a series conducted by HSBC in the five years leading up to his {{appointment as}} its chief executive.|$|E

5000|$|The {{album was}} {{produced}} by Peter Jenner, Laurie Latham, and Rick Walton. Jenner {{was one of the}} two partners in Blackhill Management, and had been producing since the late 1960s, having worked with Kevin Ayers and David Bedford among others. Although Jenner was the experienced producer at The Workhouse, in practice he left most of the production for New Boots and Panties!! to his young protégée Latham, who had joined the studio four years previously and who also engineered the album, with Walton carrying out production duties on those occasions when Latham was unavailable. Latham later recalled that Jenner's technical input on the album had been minimal and that he had more of an overseeing role: [...] "Peter would sit there rolling joints all day and I'd do all the bloody work, but in fairness <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say that he taught me an awful lot. He wasn't particularly hands-on, but he would always say things like, 'Laurie, are you sure the bass drum's loud enough? Maybe you should nudge it a bit.' It was always the bass drum or the bass, and if you think about it, the rhythm section is what really defines that record ... I think Peter was really undervalued in the end. He recognised that the bass drum and bass were potent, very integral ingredients of the overall sound - the idiosyncratic, mad Cockney-type thing on top of this quite slick, funky sort of rhythm section. And he was also very good at making sure that Ian was on the ball in terms of his vocals." ...|$|E

When you're trekking the country - as I am now for my Decca records [...] "I Should Care" [...] and [...] "More Than Anyone" [...] and for Universal International, my home studio - every hour of the day, from the morning disc jockeys to the midnight program is filled. And in Hollywood, if you're not working on a picture or getting ready for one, {{you have to keep}} studying. I make a point of answering all my mail and when anyone asks me for an autograph I'm not just flattered. I see that as the least I can do for the people who have given me the fruits of this world.In May Chandler refused to play the lead in Six Bridges to Cross and Universal put him on suspension. He was replaced in the role by George Nader. Chandler spoke of making Young Moses and a Western with friends Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh, but neither was made. He announced [...] "being a movie star isn't worth it", complaining that:I can't go anywhere as an ordinary individual. There was a time I could walk around Times Square in New York (my home town) and look into shop windows or go into a cafe and eat in peace. But no more. I can't go anywhere unnoticed. Movie fans seem to think that actors belong to them but we like to feel we belong to ourselves. Don't get me wrong - I wanted fame and money when I decided to take up acting. I like being recognised - it's flattering. But there's always one character who spoils anything... I walk into a restaurant and get a ringside table- but you remember <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> leave the biggest tip. If I don't, I'm labeled the tightest guy in town. And let's face it, acting is the easiest way I know to make a buck. But I think I'm a fairly bright boy - I figure I could have made as much in some other business... Anyone in the world with imagination and initiative can become a success. Me? I like to push buttons. I was born to be an executive - an idea man. An executive is a guy who thinks things up and has other people execute them. I'd quit work immediately if I had the money, and travel for a while. I'd like to do some writing. I marked two radio scripts and have finished synopses and five movie stories. Chandler made up with Universal who cast him in Lady Godiva of Coventry. Chandler refused the role and was replaced again by George Nader. However this time the dispute was not over money but due to Chandler's over work.|$|E
