A 2001 study demonstrated {{that if a}} reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time, such as 180–300 months (15–25 years), the monetary amount of the reward is inconsequential; instead, {{the bulk of the}} participants choose the immediate reward, even if their delayed reward would be quite large. Delayed gratification <b>has</b> <b>its</b> <b>limits,</b> and a delay can only be so long before it is judged to be not worth the effort it takes to wait.|$|E

During the Bolshevik advance against Warsaw, the Pope {{asked for}} worldwide public prayers for Poland, while Ratti {{was the only}} foreign diplomat who refused to flee Warsaw when the Red Army was approaching the city in August 1920. On 11 June 1921, Benedict XV asked Ratti to deliver his message to the Polish episcopate, warning against political misuses of spiritual power, urging again peaceful coexistence with neighbouring people, stating that “love of country <b>has</b> <b>its</b> <b>limits</b> in justice and obligations”.|$|E
25|$|Before {{all other}} heads of State, Pope Benedict XV in October 1918 congratulated the Polish {{people on their}} independence. In a public letter to Archbishop Kakowski of Warsaw, he remembered their loyalty and the many efforts of the Holy See to assist them. He {{expressed}} his hopes that Poland would again take {{its place in the}} family of nations and continue its history as an educated Christian nation. In March 1919, he nominated 10 new bishops and, soon after, Achille Ratti as papal nuncio who was already in Warsaw as his representative. He repeatedly cautioned Polish authorities against persecuting Lithuanian and Ruthenian clergy. During the Bolshevik advance against Warsaw, he asked for worldwide public prayers for Poland. Nuncio Ratti was the only foreign diplomat to stay in the Polish capital. On 11 June 1921, he wrote to the Polish episcopate, warning against political misuses of spiritual power, urging again for peaceful coexistence with neighbouring peoples, stating that “love of country <b>has</b> <b>its</b> <b>limits</b> in justice and obligations.” He sent nuncio Ratti to Silesia to act against potential political agitations of the Catholic clergy.|$|E

500|$|According to Paul Dundas, in {{and after}} the 12th century, the {{persecution}} and violence against Jains by Muslim state caused Jain scholars to revisit their theory of Ahimsa (non-violence). For example, Jinadatta Suri in 12th century, wrote {{during a time of}} widespread destruction of Jain temples and blocking of Jaina pilgrimage by Muslim armies, that [...] "anybody engaged in a religious activity who was forced to fight and kill somebody" [...] in self-defense would not lose any merit. N.L. Jain, quoting Acarya Mahaprajna, states Anekantavada doctrine is not a principle that can be applied to all situations or fields. In his view, the doctrine <b>has</b> <b>its</b> <b>limits</b> and Anekantavada doctrine does not mean intellectual tolerance or acceptance of religious violence, terrorism, taking of hostages, proxy wars such as in Kashmir, and that [...] "to initiate a conflict is as sinful as to tolerate or not oppose it".|$|E

MR-26-7 members remaining in Cuba were left to prepare cells for revolutionary action and await Castro's return. He {{sent a letter to}} the press, declaring that he was [...] "leaving Cuba because all doors of peaceful struggle have been closed to me.

[...] The Castros and several comrades traveled to Mexico, which had a long history of offering asylum to leftist exiles. Here, Raúl befriended an Argentine doctor and Marxist-Leninist named Ernesto [...] "Che" [...] Guevara, a proponent of guerrilla warfare keen to join Cuba's Revolution. Fidel liked him, later describing him as [...] "a more advanced revolutionary than I was." [...] Castro also associated with the Spaniard Alberto Bayo, a Republican veteran of the Spanish Civil War; Bayo agreed to teach Fidel's rebels the necessary skills in guerrilla warfare, clandestinely meeting them at Chapultepec for training.|$|E

[...] However, he stated that the decision to keep many of the design choices intact from the original was both refreshing and a hindrance; he highlighted examples from the campaign, such as infinitely-spawning enemies, and similarly condemned infamous perks and a lack of killstreak-countering in the multiplayer that had not been removed or fixed, finding it [...] "extremely outdated". Despite this, he complimented the multiplayer as feeling fresh, saying [...] "After years of over-the-top killstreaks, wall-running, and other crazy antics, it's nice {{to get back to the}} basics". He heavily praised the visual enhancements on display, saying [...] "Modern Warfare Remastered is the most extensive visual upgrade any remaster has ever received yet, being more in line with a remake than an actual remaster. [...] It's a stunning overhaul." [...] He concluded by saying [...] "What Raven has accomplished is impressive, but it <b>has</b> <b>its</b> <b>limits.</b> A few tweaks would have gone a long way to fixing some balancing issues, but for those looking for a blast from the past, this works just fine".|$|E
