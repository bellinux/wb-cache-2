40|$|The {{absolute}} role of climate/erosion in extrusion {{of mountains}} has been debated {{for a long}} time. Field-studies, micro-structural observations and few analytical trials confirm that the extrusion of the Higher Himalayan Shear Zone, Sutlej section took place initially by simple shearing and was followed by combined simple shear and channel flow in a shifting mode (Mukherjee 2007). The extrusion mechanism of the HHSZ is studied with 10 analogue models of channel flow initiating from a horizontal channel and extrusion through a linked inclined channel. The inclined channel is the model HHSZ and is of parallel, gently diverging-up and strongly diverging-up geometries in different considerations.

40|$|Coupled {{flows through}} and over {{permeable}} media, {{also known as}} obstructed shear flows, are ubiquitous to many environmental systems at different scales, including aquatic flows over sediment beds, and atmospheric flows over crops and cities. Despite their differences, such flows exhibit strong <b>dynamic</b> <b>similarities</b> among systems and scales, {{as evidenced by the}} recent finding of empirical universal scaling laws correlating relevant length and velocity scales. We propose a reduced complexity model for obstructed shear channel flows, which couples Brinkman with Reynolds equations to describe the flow within and above the obstruction. We derive scaling laws by intermediate asymptotic analysis of a Darcy-Brinkman type solution in the low permeability limit. The approach highlights the importance of the effective permeability of the obstruction as a critical parameter governing the system dynamical response. The model results are in good agreement with the scaling laws empirically calculated in other studies...|$|R
25|$|This equation, {{applicable}} for >10, {{shows the}} mean speed U {{of the jet}} at the orifice as the characteristic speed and the distance h from orifice to the edge as the characteristic dimension. The integer n represents the various vortex modes. It also suggests that <b>dynamic</b> <b>similarity</b> is achieved to a first approximation; one deviation is that the speed at the wedge, which is less than that at the orifice, should be the characteristic speed. A weak negative Reynolds number effect is likely. The orifice width d also has some influence; it is related to vortex size and lateral correlation of the shedding process.|$|E
25|$|In {{a classic}} set of experiments, the Englishman Osborne Reynolds (1842–1912) of the University of Manchester {{demonstrated}} that the airflow pattern over a scale model {{would be the same}} for the full-scale vehicle if a certain flow parameter were the same in both cases. This factor, now known as the Reynolds number, is a basic parameter in the description of all fluid-flow situations, including the shapes of flow patterns, the ease of heat transfer, and the onset of turbulence. This comprises the central scientific justification for the use of models in wind tunnels to simulate real-life phenomena. However, there are limitations on conditions in which <b>dynamic</b> <b>similarity</b> is based upon the Reynolds number alone.|$|E
25|$|The axis of {{rotation}} itself precesses around the pipe axis resulting in a rotating force at the pipe exit and results in a rotating dipole sound field.

A more correct speed would be that characteristic of the swirl fd, where f is the precession (and sound) frequency, based on the Rossby number. To test the relevance of this new characteristic speed, the flow rate was increased and the frequency and level of the sound was measured. Using the dipole model, the calculated force was found to be nearly proportional to (fd)2, confirming the correctness of the new characteristic speed.|$|E

Twenty male and eighteen female subjects ran barefoot on a runway equipped with a force platform. The running tests were performed in three experimental conditions. C 0 : all subjects ran at the same absolute velocity V= 3. 5 m. s- 1; C 1 : the velocity was determined from the N Fr; C 2 : the stride frequency was determined from Str. In both men and women, the use of Strouhal number (C 2) allowed obtaining the best correlations between anthropometric and kinetic similarity ratios i. e. the best <b>dynamic</b> <b>similarities.</b> However, it appears that the determination of similar dynamic running conditions needs to be specified in order to take leg stiffness into account.

It was found that electrolytic bubbles were generated uniformly under the entire anode surface and grew through gas diffusion and coalescence. With increasing current density (CD) and anode inclination angle to the horizontal, bubble velocity increased underneath the anode surface. Moreover, the bubble layer thickness and bubble sizes decreased with an increase in anode inclination angle. Bubble coverage under the anode also decreased with increasing anode inclination angle, but was found to be insensitive to the change in CD.

The air bubble entrainment may be localised (hydraulic jumps, plunging jets) or continuous along an interface (water jets, chutes).

Herein the basic air bubble entrainment processes are reviewed and the relevant <b>dynamic</b> <b>similarities</b> are discussed. Traditionally, physical studies are conducted using a Froude similitude which implies drastically smaller laboratory Reynolds numbers than in the corresponding prototype flows. Basic dimensional analyses are developed for both singular and interfacial aeration processes.

Recent studies of local air–water flow properties highlight that turbulence levels, entrained bubble sizes and interfacial areas are improperly scaled based upon a Froude similitude even in large-size models operating with the so defined Reynolds numbers up to 5 E+ 5. In laboratory models, the dimensionless turbulence levels, air–water interfacial areas and mass transfer rates are drastically underestimated...|$|R

These hazardous phenomena are only partially understood because {{of the absence of}} direct observations, the restriction of the instrumental seismic record to the past century, and the limited resolution/completeness of historical to geological archives. To overcome these restrictions, modeling has become a key-tool to study megathrust earthquakes. We present a novel model to investigate the seismic cycle at subduction thrusts using complementary analog (paper 1) and numerical (paper 2) approaches. Here we introduce a simple scaled gelatin-on-sandpaper setup including realistic tectonic loading, spontaneous rupture nucleation, and viscoelastic response of the lithosphere. Particle image velocimetry allows to derive model deformation and earthquake source parameters. Analog earthquakes are characterized by “quasi-periodic” recurrence. Consistent with elastic theory, the interseismic stage shows rearward motion, subsidence in the outer wedge and uplift of the “coastal area” as a response of locked plate interface at shallow depth. The coseismic stage exhibits order of magnitude higher velocities and reversal of the interseismic deformation pattern in the seaward direction, subsidence of the coastal area, and uplift in the outer wedge. Like natural earthquakes, analog earthquakes generally nucleate in the deeper portion of the rupture area and preferentially propagate upward in a crack-like fashion. Scaled rupture width-slip proportionality and seismic moment-duration scaling verifies <b>dynamic</b> <b>similarities</b> with earthquakes. Experimental repeatability is statistically verified.
