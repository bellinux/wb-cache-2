40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration {{has been}} {{conducting}} {{a series of tests}} to determine the effect of <b>heavy</b> <b>rain</b> on airfoil aerodynamics. The results of these tests have shown that <b>heavy</b> <b>rain</b> can significantly increase drag as well as decrease lift and stall angle of attack. This paper describes a recent effort to use the <b>heavy</b> <b>rain</b> airfoil data to determine the aerodynamic effect on a conventional twin-jet transport. The paper reports on the method used to model the <b>heavy</b> <b>rain</b> aerodynamic effect and the resulting performance degradation. The <b>heavy</b> <b>rain</b> performance effect is presented in terms of the diminished climb performance associated with increasing rain rates. The effect of <b>heavy</b> <b>rain</b> on the airplane's ability to escape a performance-limiting wind shear is illustrated through a numerical simulation of a wet microburst encounter. The results of this paper accentuate the need for further testing to determine scaling relationships and flow mechanics, and the full configuration three-dimensional effects of <b>heavy</b> <b>rain...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Heavy</b> <b>rain</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} high-impact weather phenomena that occasionally affect Mediterranean areas. The aim of this study is to achieve a classification of atmospheric patterns related to <b>heavy</b> <b>rain</b> events in both French and Spanish Mediterranean regions. The classification is made on some atmospheric fields (geopotential at 1000 hPa and at 500 hPa and temperature at 850 hPa) of HIRLAM-INM- 0. 5 ◦ operational analysis, for <b>heavy</b> <b>rain</b> events included in the High Impact Weather MEDEX database. It covers a period of roughly 7 and a half years, from January 1997 to May 2004. A Principal Components Analysis was conducted to reduce the number of variables. After that, by means of a Cluster Analysis, the <b>heavy</b> <b>rain</b> events are classified into 8 atmospheric patterns. The results show a good relationship between regions affected by <b>heavy</b> <b>rain</b> and atmospheric patterns, in the sense that the same atmospheric patterns usually produce <b>heavy</b> <b>rain</b> in different regions, and <b>heavy</b> <b>rain</b> in different regions is usually due to specific atmospheric patterns. ...|$|R

40|$|There was a <b>heavy</b> <b>rain</b> over Nagasaki districts on 23 July 1982. It killed 299 {{persons and}} damaged {{severely}} to Nagasaki City and its neighboring towns.
