40|$|An {{algorithm}} for {{the reduction}} of one-loop n-point tensor <b>integrals</b> <b>to</b> basic <b>integrals</b> is proposed. We transform tensor <b>integrals</b> <b>to</b> scalar <b>integrals</b> with shifted dimension and reduce these by recurrence relations <b>to</b> <b>integrals</b> in generic dimension. Also the integration-by-parts method is used to reduce indices (powers of scalar propagators) of the scalar diagrams. The obtained recurrence relations for one-loop integrals are explicitly evaluated for 5 - and 6 -point functions. In the latter case the corresponding Gram determinant vanishes identically for d= 4, which greatly simplifies {{the application of the}} recurrence relations.

5|$|Since antiquity {{the concept}} of force has been {{recognized}} as <b>integral</b> <b>to</b> the functioning {{of each of the}} simple machines. The mechanical advantage given by a simple machine allowed for less force to be used in exchange for that force acting over a greater distance for the same amount of work. Analysis of the characteristics of forces ultimately culminated in the work of Archimedes who was especially famous for formulating a treatment of buoyant forces inherent in fluids.|$|E
5|$|The French Revolution was <b>integral</b> <b>to</b> the {{expansion}} of French cuisine, because it abolished the guild system.

He spent his younger years working at a pâtisserie until he was discovered by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, who would later cook for Napoleon Bonaparte. Prior to his employment with Talleyrand, Carême had become known for his pièces montées, which were extravagant constructions of pastry and sugar architecture.|$|E
