The order was lifted after six weeks when the Office of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Hazard</b> Assessment determined that the area’s seafood was safe to eat and posed “no significant health threat.” The closure impacted commercial fishermen and fishing charters. Local commercial fishermen reported that {{it was tough to}} sell the fish caught outside of the closed area because of the impression that all of the region’s seafood was tainted from the oil spill. There is also a long term concern that the oil may have wiped out the main food source for some sea life in the area. The predominant products from the Santa Barbara region are red sea urchin and red rock crab with an average of $11 million in sales revenue per year ...|$|E

In May 2009, Minnesota and Chicago were the first US jurisdictions to pass regulations limiting or banning BPA. In June 2009, the FDA announced its decision to reconsider the BPA safety levels. Grassroots political action led Connecticut to become the first US state to ban bisphenolA not only from infant formula and baby food containers, but also from any reusable food or beverage container. [...] In July 2009, the California Environmental Protection Agency's Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity Identification Committee in the California Office of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Hazard</b> Assessment unanimously voted against placing BisphenolA on the state's list of chemicals that are believed to cause reproductive harm. The panel was concerned over the growing scientific evidence showing BPA's reproductive harm in animals, found that there was insufficient data of the effects in humans. Critics pointed out that the same panel failed to add second-hand smoke to the list until 2006, and only one chemical was added to the list in the last three years. In September, the US Environmental Protection Agency announced that it was evaluating BPA for an action plan development. [...] In October, the NIH announced $30,000,000 in stimulus grants to study the health effects of BPA. This money was supposed to result in many peer-reviewed publications.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 115 - 125). Health in {{the developing}} world is becoming particularly complex due to disparate economic and environmental contexts residing in close spatial proximity, each paving the way for widely different <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> <b>hazards</b> resulting in acute and chronic illness. In navigating this increasingly heterogeneous landscape, children in Accra, Ghana face multiple types of <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> <b>hazards</b> as they travel from home, to school, to friends' houses, and to visit family. A child-in-home, or even child-in-neighborhood model of third world urban <b>health</b> <b>hazards</b> cannot account for the complexity of <b>hazards</b> and <b>health</b> threats faced by children on a daily basis. Yet children in Accra, particularly as they move out of their especially vulnerable early years, manage to navigate and mitigate <b>health</b> <b>hazards.</b> Little is known about how children perceive <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> hazards: their spatially situated knowledge of hazards within daily environments may lead {{to a better understanding of}} how space and place drive human-environment health interactions. Furthermore, numerous studies have demonstrated that children in both the developed and developing world are acting with increased agency regarding health. This research proposes to advance the <b>health</b> geography, <b>environmental</b> <b>health,</b> and health education literature by working with children from three diverse contextual backgrounds in a developing third world city to examine verbal, visual, and spatial perceptions of <b>health</b> and <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> <b>hazards.</b> The dissertation does this by establishing baseline differences of children and adult's perceptions of children's health, testing child-friendly visual methods of assessing health knowledge, and developing a novel method of assessing spatial patterns of health perceptions through GPS and photography. Results indicate that children in Accra have distinct, and often varying, perceptions of health when compared to adults and across socioeconomic groups. Photographic methods that contextualize health are good measures of health knowledge and perceptions. Furthermore, placing health perceptions in space as children move through the environment sheds light on spatial properties of health perceptions, such as health related landmarks, and regional categorization of spaces into healthy and unhealthy places...|$|R
