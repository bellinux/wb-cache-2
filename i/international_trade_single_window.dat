Now day’s customs administration is a relevant regulatory operator in international trade as facilitator and accele-rator of trade. However, the study of efficiency on the public sector {{is more complex than}} the study of efficiency in the private, profit-oriented sector; {{due to the fact that}} public sector efficiency can be defined as capacity to achieve goals instead of perceiving profits. The aim of this research is to identify those areas which yield the greatest cost/efficiency gains from the implementation of the e-service system <b>International</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Single</b> <b>Window</b> (ITSW) and to note the ob-stacles or disadvantages present on the implementation of the ITSW in Mexico as a case of study.

40|$|In {{the run-up}} to the 1992 single-market deadline, there were {{concerns}} that inter-industry adjustment pressures among EU member countries would increase. Such expectations were due partly to a perceived reversal of the post-Second World War growth in intra-industry trade (IIT). Finds that average IIT levels continued to rise during the implementation of the single market. It is argued that the concept of marginal IIT(MIIT) is of greater relevance to adjustment than “static” IIT. Some evidence is shown to support this proposition, and a comprehensive set of intra-EU MIIT indices is calculated for the 1980 s. Since average MIIT levels in the 1988 - 92 period were higher than in the early 1980 s, this analysis also supports the conclusion that, on average, adjustment to the single market was no more disruptive than that experienced during earlier stages of European integration. It also appears that the forces for inter-industry adjustment are stronger in traditional, declining industries, whereas the expansion of relatively advanced industries tends to be more evenly shared by the EU member countries.

The objective is to use electronic data instead of paper documents and to connect different computer systems of government agencies and businesses. Against the backdrop of a fast-changing <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> environment and information technology innovation, the <b>Single</b> <b>Window</b> concept emerged and has been adopted by several governments with a view to streamlining and simplifying regulatory requirements in the trans-border movement of goods. <b>Single</b> <b>window</b> systems aim to simplify border formalities for traders and other economic operators by arranging for a single electronic submission of information to fulfill all cross-border regulatory requirements, and it is thus preeminently a tool for trade facilitation.

Information and data management during the cross-border activities plays a vital role which contributes to the efficiency of supply chain and public administration that indirectly has an impact on market performance. In conjunction with the international demand, Malaysia has developed its National <b>Single</b> <b>Window</b> (NSW) as part of the country's national agenda to facilitate <b>international</b> <b>trade.</b> NSW is also a prerequisite to regional integration through the ASEAN <b>Single</b> <b>Window</b> (ASW) development in the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) to support the free flow of goods among the member countries. <b>Single</b> <b>window</b> remains a major issue among the respective community in Malaysia. In the event of ASW protocol and AEC agenda, the implementation of the <b>single</b> <b>window</b> concept is far from its aim to become a single focal point for the cross-border custom clearance process. Currently, <b>single</b> <b>window</b> is not a purely single focus point where virtually it is a version of <b>single</b> <b>window</b> front-end but with the existence of multiple windows in the back-end due to the redundant control of the respective authorities on top of custom approval.
