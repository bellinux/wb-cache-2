50|$|The initial {{design of}} the plant used seven {{horizontal}} Francis-type turbines manufactured by King's SB&SV company, each equipped with four runners 41 in in diameter, producing 1000 HP. These turbines drove a 750 kW generator at 114 rpm. The generators produced 12,000 volts three-phase power at 38 Hz. Two exciter turbine/generators were initially installed to provide 125 V and 250 kW of DC <b>excitation</b> <b>power</b> for the main generators, but DC power has been provided by a static system for more than 50 years.

50|$|Magnetic {{amplifiers}} were extensively used {{in electricity}} power generation {{from the early}} 1960s onwards. They provided the small signal amplification for generator automatic voltage regulation (AVR) from a small error signal at milliwatt (mW) level to 100 kilowatt (kW) level. This was in turn converted by a rotating machine (exciter) to 5 megawatt (MW) level, the <b>excitation</b> <b>power</b> required by a typical 500 MW Power Plant Turbine Generator Unit. They proved durable and reliable. Many are recorded in service through the mid-1990s and some are still in use at older generating stations, notably in hydroelectric plants operating in northern California.|$|E
50|$|Excitation {{frequencies}} in the low-frequency (LF) range, usually around 100 kHz, require {{several hundred}} volts {{to sustain the}} discharge. These large voltages lead to high-energy ion bombardment of surfaces. High-frequency plasmas are often excited at the standard 13.56 MHz frequency widely available for industrial use; at high frequencies, the displacement current from sheath movement and scattering from the sheath assist in ionization, and thus lower voltages are sufficient to achieve higher plasma densities. Thus one can adjust the chemistry and ion bombardment in the deposition by changing the frequency of excitation, or by using a mixture of low- and high-frequency signals in a dual-frequency reactor. <b>Excitation</b> <b>power</b> of tens to hundreds of watts is typical for an electrode with a diameter of 200 to 300 mm.|$|E

50|$|In a Ward Leonard system, a {{prime mover}} drives a direct current (DC) {{generator}} {{at a constant}} speed. The armature of the DC generator is connected directly to the armature of a DC motor. The DC motor drives the load equipment at an adjustable speed. The motor speed is adjusted by adjusting the output voltage of the generator using a rheostat to adjust the excitation current in the field winding. The motor field current is usually not adjusted, but the motor field is sometimes reduced {{to increase the speed}} above the base speed. The prime mover is usually an alternating current (AC) motor, but a DC motor or an engine might be used instead.

50|$|Live {{images from}} the {{fluorescent}} dye and the surgical field are obtained {{using a combination of}} filters, lenses and cameras. During open surgery, hand held devices are usually preferred for their ease of use and mobility. A stand or arm can be used to maintain the system on top of the operating field, particularly when the weight and complexity of the device is high (e.g. when multiple cameras are used). The main disadvantage of such devices is that operating theater lights can interfere with the fluorescence emission channel, with a consequent decrease of signal-to-background ratio. This issue is usually solved by dimming or switching off the theater lights during fluorescence detection. FGS can also be performed using minimally invasive devices such as laparoscopes or endoscopes. In this case, a system of filters, lenses and cameras is attached {{to the end of the}} probe. Unlike open surgery, the background from external light sources is reduced. Nevertheless, the <b>excitation</b> <b>power</b> density at the sample is limited by the low light transmission of the fiber optics in endoscopes and laparoscopes, particularly in the near infrared. Moreover, the ability of collecting light is much reduced compared to standard imaging lenses used for open surgery devices.FGS devices can also be implemented for robotic surgery (for example in the da Vinci Surgical System).|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we present a}} study of {{photoluminescence}} PL on Si nanocrystals NC produced by ion implantation on SiO 2 targets at temperatures ranging between room temperature and 800 °C and subsequently annealed in N 2 atmosphere. The PL measurements were performed at low <b>excitation</b> <b>power</b> density (20 mW/cm²) {{in order to avoid}} nonlinear effects. Broad PL spectra were obtained, presenting a line-shape structure that can be reproduced by two superimposed peaks at around 780 and 950 nm. We have observed that both PL intensity and line-shape change by varying the annealing as well as the implantation temperatures. Implantations performed at 400 °C or higher produce a remarkable effect in the PL line shape, evidenced by a strong redshift, and a striking intensity increase of the peak located at the long-wavelength side of the PL spectrum. In addition we have studied the PL dependence on the <b>excitation</b> <b>power</b> density (from 0. 002 to 15 W/cm²).
