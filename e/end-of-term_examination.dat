25|$|The academy's {{curriculum}} {{like that}} of other senior high schools in Ghana, operates in a three-year academic cycle, from form one to form three. The beginning of the first academic year marks the enrolment of the student in the academy, while {{the ending of the}} third academic year marks the graduation of the student. During their three-year enrollment in the academy, students are provided with text books for their studies, prescribed by the Ghana Education Service. The academy's curriculum follows the normal senior high school calendar, as such, students are taught from January to December over a period of three terms, comprising a total of 40 weeks per year. The academic assessment of students is undertaken twice within a term, with students writing a mid-term examination and an <b>end-of-term</b> <b>examination,</b> which both contribute to the students cumulative assessment score.|$|E
60|$|Frederick Wackerbath Bradshaw was, as I {{have pointed}} out, my {{contemporary}} at St Austin's. We {{were in the}} same House, and together we sported on the green--and elsewhere--and did our best to turn the majority of the staff of masters into confirmed pessimists, they in the meantime endeavouring to do the same by us with every weapon that lay to their hand. And the worst of these weapons were the <b>end-of-term</b> <b>examination</b> papers. Mellish was our form-master, and once a term a demon entered into Mellish. He brooded silently apart from the madding crowd. He wandered through dry places seeking rest, and at intervals he would smile evilly, and jot down a note on the back of an envelope. These notes, collected and printed closely on the vilest paper, made up the examination questions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{initially}} {{notes the}} role of scientific education in a developing country {{and the need to}} enhance scientific education among the school population. Enhancement of science education for all pupils is dependent on the distribution of schools, quality of schools and pupil participation in any country. To understand how science education is advanced in a developing country {{it is also important to}} know who is currently succeeding in science education in schools and to understand how this success is distributed amongst the school population. Thus, this paper questions whether school-based science achievement may be predetermined by antecedent factors or whether there is an equal opportunity of success amongst all pupil participants. A review of the literature has found that many antecedent factors affect school and science achievement, and these factors may be more important than within-school processes thought to enhance science education. The antecedent factors refer to: social/home background; age, religion and sex of the pupil; school class level and size; type of school attended and its locality. This study assesses how antecedent factors affect science performance in a representative sample of pupils in primary and secondary schools throughout Trinidad and Tobago. The representative sample totalled 1998 children, aged 6 - 10 years. Pupils were selected from a geographic transect of Trinidad and Tobago, which fulfilled demographic criteria. Once pupils were selected, biographic data were obtained for each child. Science achievement was measured by an <b>end-of-term</b> science <b>examination</b> designed for each class by the class teacher and graded on a 100 % scale (within each class). Within class pupil scores were 'standardized' for comparisons between classes, schools, etc. Results from the analyses are summarized as: science achievement scores decrease as pupils increase in age. Girls perform consistently better than boys, with a slight variation in the sex by religion by school level interaction. Pupils in private schools score higher than pupils in similar levels of state schools. Pupils from a middle class background perform better than pupils from a working class background. Differences in performance relate to the religion of the child, with Muslim pupils scoring higher than Hindu or Christian pupils. Pupils in single-sex schools perform at higher levels than pupils in co-educational schools, and this is true for girls-only and boys-only schools. At the secondary school level the type of school attended is related to science achievement performance with pupils in prestige (usually church controlled) schools performing better than pupils in the comprehensive (state controlled) schools. The results support, develop and refine the previous literature on school and science achievement. Unusually, girls are at the forefront of science achievement in both primary and secondary schools. Also, traditional prejudices of social class, school status and location are confirmed within the school system in Trinidad and Tobago. A number of directions for future research and classroom action studies are indicated which focus on the existence of these inequalities. © 1988. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

30|$|Five {{hundred and}} fifty-two {{students}} enrolled in the gamified course of a distance learning Bachelor’s class in educational science, 229 of which were registered for the <b>end-of-term</b> <b>examination.</b> As a preparation for the end-of-term paper, voluntary online group work in Moodle was offered for 3  weeks during the term in which 62 students continuously participated. They were automatically awarded a “Teamworker” badge once they completed the pre-defined tasks associated with the online collaboration. Further activities were linked to an “Expert” badge for the module as a reward for being active and for completing the pre-defined tasks throughout the term. Once awarded, the badge appeared in the students’ profile and recipients could decide whether to make the badge visible to their fellow students or to keep it to themselves.|$|E
40|$|Many {{learners}} with {{an additional}} language (AL) as their language of learning and teaching (LoLT) have not acquired the level of proficiency required for them to demonstrate their knowledge and achieve the desired outcome on assessment tasks given in that language. Using instruments designed for fully fluent learners and covertly including proficiency in the AL when assessing them academically or clinically, is inequitable and certainly yields invalid results. The notion of language of learning, teaching and assessment (LoLTA) should replace LoLT to represent the dilemma more accurately. This paper reports on empirical research in Nigeria using curriculum-based dynamic assessment (CDA) as an alternative method of assessment of AL learners in mainstream education. The study aimed to {{determine the influence of}} the CDA procedure on the performance and affect of AL learners. Eight learners in Grade 8 selected from two schools participated in a process of debriefing and mediation during three continuous assessment cycles and the <b>end-of-term</b> <b>examination</b> in Business Studies and Integrated Science. The assessments were mediational in nature as they contained linguistic adaptations of the questions and incorporated a glossary of assessment terms. The results suggest a generally positive influence of CDA, although to varying degrees, on participants’ performance and affect. The school context also has a crucial influence on these two aspects.

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} facing educators today is to engage students in an active learning environment. Owing to the diversity of the student cohort, educators need to explore new and exciting ways of engaging students in the course content. One important aspect associated with this ongoing challenge is to reflect on one’s own teaching practice. This reflection provides an opportunity to develop innovative ways to guide student learning and to improve overall course performance. The use of asynchronous learning networks is growing in popularity, which provide students with more flexible delivery of courses. This paper explores the relationship between student engagement through online delivery of materials and assessment and <b>end-of-term</b> <b>examination</b> performance. In addition, comparisons are made between students studying in different modes. The paper presents data from a study involving all students enrolled in FINC 19011 Business Finance at Central Queensland University in Winter Term in 2002 and 2003. Initially in 2002, only the course materials were made available to students online through WebCT. Owing to the frequent use of virtual materials by students in 2002, online assessment was introduced in 2003. Inferences are drawn from the study as to whether students who frequently engaged in online learning performed better than students who rarely used the virtual materials...|$|E
