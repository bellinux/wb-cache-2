The integration between the three propositions means that the entire potential for SMEs to contribute to the reduction in LCOEs is not reaped unless the SMEs are situated in a triple helix context with inter- and intra-reciprocal organisational learning. Their own active interpretation of meaning within business model innovation both in society, governmental, university and industry contexts, as well as in its own SME context is essential. This sheds light on the important overall issues concerning the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> to reduce LCOEs.|$|E

3000|$|The {{installation}} {{and operation of}} wind farms require different actors in many projects, including the wind farm owners, {{as well as a}} range of larger and smaller suppliers within construction, production, {{installation and}} O&M activities. The actors in the industry are all dependent on each other, according to the LCOE calculation approach. Collaboration with small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is particularly important, as their part of the work in offshore wind farms is estimated to be 60 – 70  % of the total cost of a wind farm (Danish Wind association statistics 2012). SMEs often lack time and resources in their organisations. Moreover, SMEs are typically more creative and flexible than larger organisations (Brink and Madsen 2015; Edwards et al. 2005; Murphy 1996). <b>Integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> to reap the potential innovation present within renewable energy is therefore beneficial from society’s point of view.

40|$|In {{recognition}} of their substantial contribution to the economy {{both in terms of}} number of enterprises and workers, the Philippine government has put in place a number of policies and programs designed specifically to boost SME productivity and competitiveness in the country. However, the performance of SMEs in the last decade has not been vigorous enough to boost the Philippine manufacturing industry. As such, the deepening of high technology industries in terms of the creation of backward linkages has remained weak. While the country’s exports of high technology products have grown rapidly, the value added of these exports is very low due to the limited links of large domestic and foreign companies to the domestic economy. Rapid changes in the international trade and the growing complexity of global production system, pose a significant challenge to Filipino SMEs. This paper reviews existing government SME policies as well as recent developments in the manufacturing sector, {{within the context of the}} emerging global production network. The paper draws on the findings of a survey interview of SMEs in the automotive, electronics, and garments sectors.

40|$|Small to {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) constitute {{the majority of}} firms {{in the construction industry}} and are therefore of prime importance in the construction supply chain. Despite this fact, little {{attention has been paid to}} SMEs with respect to supply chain management (SCM). SMEs in Australia were surveyed, via a postal questionnaire, to identify business strategies, current SCM practices, the concerns and the barriers that SMEs encountered in developing an integrated supply chain. Following the surveys, face-to-face interviews with construction professionals were also conducted to obtain their views on these issues and to seek strategies to overcome such barriers/concerns. Amongst the research outcomes it was found that the SMEs&# 8217; business strategies are mainly focused on improving profit growth, providing a high quality product and lowering total deliver costs. It is also found that the SCM practice by the SMEs typically aims to reduce the delivery time of materials, and determine customers&# 8217; future needs. On the other hand, the research found that at the same time SMEs are concerned with the lack of interest among suppliers and customers, lack of sophisticated information systems and competition from other supply chains. It is also found that the price/contract/project-based relationship between the main contractor and subcontractors is the main barrier hinders supply chain integration and management. However, the research found that SMEs do not seem to be concerned with a lack of trust and cooperation among supply chain members as this is usually covered by contractual relationships. It is found that there is a need to improve project coordination and information sharing, as well as shortening time to respond to requests for information. Further to these, the research found that the level of e-commerce practice by the SMEs has improved in recent years and this provides a good platform for the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> into the construction supply chain through e-commerce. Despite the above provisos the findings reflected that supply chain integration is an important issue for construction SMEs and the use of compatible information system will increase the supply chain integration and management and hence improve the performance of the entire construction supply chain...|$|E
30|$|The {{notion of}} the triple helix with blurred {{boundaries}} and a combination of integration and differentiation between participants raises the following questions: How should the boundaries be blurred? How should the combination of integration and differentiation be done? Answering these questions requires an enhancement of competition and cooperation. Polenske (2004) reveals interrelationships among competition, cooperation and collaboration in networks of firms at the regional level. According to Polenske (2004), this triangle of connections reduces costs. The relationship and the subsequent results on competition and cooperation and the resulting reduction on transaction costs were initially identified by Coase (1937) and later elaborated upon by Williamson (1996). The transaction costs approach compares {{the costs associated with}} two sources of origin for the transaction—the external market and the internal organisation. In this notion, it must be revealed whether it is more cost-effective to coordinate the transaction through the external market (competition) or to have the organisation oversee and manage the transaction (cooperation). According to Polenske (2004), value is also a result of collaboration, which is termed as the reduction of adaption costs. As reported by Polenske (2004), collaboration arrangements among firms often lead to internal long-term economies of scale. The result of collaboration on innovation may well affect the firm’s position on its long-run average cost curve. For example, by collaborating on the design and production of a product, two or more firms can lower costs and more quickly create new products for utilisation on a longer time horizon. This leads, in turn, to workers acquiring new skills and firms sharing capital investments and the risks of operations. Network connections among firms thus enhance a flexible structure of the enterprise driven by the interests of the networking firms on competition, cooperation and collaboration activities to enable innovation. In the offshore wind energy context, a call for collaboration is present because {{of the size of the}} offshore wind farms (small power plants at sea) and the many organisations in private, public and university context participating on the reduction in LCOEs. Research studies have previously noted that the triple helix notion does show a beneficiary impact from different forms of collaboration (Etzkowitz and Viale 2010; Leydesdorff 2012; Etzkowitz 2014). Here, SMEs with an entrepreneurial approach on value creation in public-private ventures could make an even more positive contribution. The docile approach on teachability and educability and inter-subjective interaction between SMEs, as noted by York et al. (2013), has the opportunity to enhance the contribution through network activities among SMEs. The anticipation is therefore a positive impact from <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>SMEs</b> in triple helix collaboration on innovation for the reduction in LCOEs.|$|E
40|$|Small {{and medium}} {{enterprises}} (SME) are the innovation carriers {{of the industry}} and especially for the technology-oriented automotive industry. For a more extensive <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>SME</b> in the software development many obstacles have to be overcome, because of the big structural and cultural differences to large-scale enterprises. In these companies the development is organized by tightly regulated development processes and often long-term decision making processes, which are necessary because of the distributed development by many engineers. In opposite to that is the advantage <b>of</b> <b>SME</b> their big flexibility and the more simple process organisation, which leads to creative solutions, fast decisions and a customer oriented work. The approach in this thesis introduces a development process, which bases on interfaces and methods from large-scale enterprises processes. But the processes itself are simplified, combined and weighted in a different way. The goal is to skip the elements, which were introduced to organize the massive parallel work of engineers, but to keep those elements, which ensure a high software quality. It is shown that especially model-based development is best suited to support this goal. Additionally a development tool was realized, that fits to the new process approach and enables model-based software development. The introduced processes were implemented and evaluated in a small development company. It is shown, that the processes are successfully approved by the assessment method Automotive SPICE. For the development tool requirements were defined and the architecture is presented. The main design element is an abstraction layer, which separates the configuration from the modeling-tool and integrates the parameters for simulations and code generation. For evaluation different case studies are presented. The case studies show and discuss the usage of the tool and methods in developing electronic control units for automotive applications. The interface to different external software tools is evaluated and discussed. In summary the thesis presents an approach, how small and medium enterprises give a beneficial contribution {{to the development of}} automotive control-systems, when processes and tools support the individual advantages of these enterprises...|$|R

Problems particularly appear when processes of multiple suppliers have to {{be integrated into the}} sales processes of the commercial agencies. The paper addresses the issue of process optimization in form of a mobile multi-supplier sales information system for micro-sized commercial agencies. Two major areas of improvements can be realized: Firstly, by an optimized business process <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> multiple <b>SME</b> suppliers and their sales representatives in micro-sized commercial agencies (internal supplier oriented sales processes), and secondly, by an increased mobility in connection with an optimization of sales processes outside of the office infrastructure (external customer sales processes).

The relevant processes and the use cases depend strongly on certain key parameters of a commercial agency's business relationships with its suppliers. Therefore, the paper introduces a branch independent concept for the sales cockpit with the focus on selected sales scenarios, relevant business processes, and derived use cases depending on selected key parameters.
