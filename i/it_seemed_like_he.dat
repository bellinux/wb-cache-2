500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Cindy White {{praised the}} writing for Deangelo's character saying that [...] "Ferrell {{is much better}} carrying the show on his own than being second banana to Carell. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was having more fun with the role in this episode". She ultimately gave the episode a 7.0/10. New Yorks Phoebe Reilly wrote that [...] "while {{it was nice to}} see the staff responding to someone new, it didn't feel like enough to make an audience antsy to come back after a long summer." [...] Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly also gave the episode a mediocre review commenting that [...] "judging by tonight's episode alone, the transition from the Carell era to the post-Carell era is going to be shaky, to say the least". [...] "The Inner Circle" [...] was voted the fourth lowest-rated episode out of 24 from the seventh season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally.

2500|$|Beginning in 1888, Tradem also {{authored}} short {{memoirs of}} his many meetings with Macedonski, in particular of their conversations. He recalled being familiar with many of Macedonski's original theories on various subjects, including astronomy and the works of Camille Flammarion. Demetrescu noted that Macedonski's theories claimed to explain {{the workings of the}} Universe in [...] "a different way" [...] and based [...] "on his imagination", but argued that [...] "for a moment , <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> could convince anyone". He also recorded that the theistic Macedonski answered [...] "positive science" [...] with [...] "the grin of skepticism". Nevertheless, according to Tradem, Alexandru Macedonski flirted with Naturalism during the early part of his career, and admired the works of Gustave Flaubert and Émile Zola. His memoirs also provided detail on Macedonski's interest in visual arts, indicating that the older poet had always wished to become a painter, and that his determination had instead shaped the artistic career of his son Alexis.|$|E

It was wrong, uncalled for and I recognize the severity of what I said. I apologize to you, Laura, and ask for your forgiveness." [...] He offered an indefinite self-suspension without pay. Ingraham accepted his apology: [...] "Ed Schultz said something about me on his show that was not all that nice, to say the least. It was pretty crude. He apologized, and I accept his apology. It seemed heartfelt, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> really wished he hadn't said it and I accept that apology." [...] MSNBC {{issued a statement saying}} that it had accepted Schultz's offer to take one week of unpaid leave over the matter. Schultz ended his radio show on May 23, 2014. He stated on MSNBC, [...] "This change will give me more flexibility to be on the road, to do the kind of shows I want to do here for The Ed Show here on MSNBC. This is on me, you know.
