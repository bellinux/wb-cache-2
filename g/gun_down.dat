25|$|The {{ratification}} of the 18th amendment to the Constitution in 1919 made the production and sale (including exportation) of alcoholic beverages illegal in the United States. This ushered {{in the beginning of}} {{what is known as the}} Gangster Era, a time that roughly spans from 1919 until 1933 when Prohibition was repealed. The 1920s saw gangsters, including Al Capone, Dion O'Banion, Bugs Moran and Tony Accardo battle law enforcement and each other on the streets of Chicago during the Prohibition era. Chicago was the location of the infamous St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929, when Al Capone sent men to <b>gun</b> <b>down</b> members of his rival gang, North Side, led by Bugs Moran.|$|E
500|$|Several {{changes were}} made to the final shows in Los Angeles after the September 11 attacks: Madonna wore an American flag kilt during the show's opening segment as a display of patriotism, the closing of [...] "Mer Girl" [...] (part II) was altered to remove the staged {{shooting}} of a character; Madonna instead put the <b>gun</b> <b>down,</b> hugged him and they left the stage together. [...] The macabre cannibalism-themed [...] "Funny Song" [...] was removed. Additionally, as a surprise for Madonna at the final concert date, her husband at the time, Guy Ritchie, appeared as the lost technician at the end of [...] "Beautiful Stranger", the Samurai during [...] "Sky Fits Heaven" [...] wore Los Angeles Lakers jerseys. Also, all of the dancers joined in for the final dance section of [...] "Holiday", which usually only featured Madonna and her two backing singers.

500|$|Throughout his flying service Ball was {{primarily}} a [...] "lone-wolf" [...] pilot, stalking his prey from below until he drew close enough to use his top-wing Lewis gun on its Foster mounting, angled to fire upwards into the enemy's fuselage. [...] According to fellow ace and Victoria Cross recipient James McCudden, [...] "it was quite {{a work of art}} to pull this <b>gun</b> <b>down</b> and shoot upwards, {{and at the same time}} manage one's machine accurately". [...] Ball was as much a loner on the ground as in the air, preferring to stay in his hut on the flight line away from other squadron members. His off-duty hours were spent tending his small garden and practising the violin. [...] Though not unsociable per se, he was extremely sensitive and shy. Ball acted as his own mechanic on his aircraft and, as a consequence, was often untidy and dishevelled. His singularity in dress extended to his habit of flying without a helmet and goggles, and he wore his thick black hair longer than regulations generally permitted.|$|E
500|$|Jefferis {{took the}} {{prototype}} Baby Bombard apart {{on the floor}} of his office in MD1 and rebuilt it, and then combined it with a hollow-charge mortar bomb to create what he called the 'Jefferis Shoulder Gun'. Jefferis then had a small number of prototype armour-piercing HEAT rounds made, and took the weapon to be tested at the Small Arms School at Bisley. A Warrant Officer took the Shoulder <b>Gun</b> <b>down</b> to a firing range, aimed it at an armoured target, and pulled the trigger; the Shoulder Gun pierced a hole in the target, but unfortunately also wounded the Warrant Officer when a piece of metal from the exploding round flew back and hit him. Jefferis himself then took the place of the Warrant Officer and fired off several more rounds, all of which pierced the armoured target but without wounding him. [...] Impressed with the weapon, the Ordnance Board of the Small Arms School had the faults with the ammunition corrected, renamed the Shoulder Gun as the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank, and ordered that it be issued to infantry units as a hand-held anti-tank weapon. Production of the PIAT began at the end of August 1942.|$|E
500|$|The alpha male stops its {{attack on}} the glass door, making a butterfly-shaped smear on it. Neville realizes the alpha male is {{identifying}} the female upon which he was experimenting by a butterfly tattoo, and the Darkseekers simply want her back. Amazed {{that they have the}} intelligence to try and communicate to him, as he had previously believed the infected had lost all humanity, Neville puts his <b>gun</b> <b>down</b> and returns the female. After Neville wakes the female up, she cries upon seeing the alpha male and they rub heads. Neville softly apologizes, having realised that while the Darkseekers are no longer human, they still retain some of their humanity and emotions. The alpha male keeps the other Darkseekers back and orders them to leave. Shocked by the ordeal, Neville sits down for a moment in his laboratory, realizing that he was the monster in the Darkseekers' eyes. Looking over the pictures of his numerous test subjects, the implications of his research methods begin to dawn on him, causing him to feel remorse and relief at the same time. The following day, Neville, Anna, and Ethan drive away from the city under a new broadcast, recorded by Anna, with a message to any human survivors that they [...] "are not alone".|$|E

2500|$|The {{fallout from}} the {{coverage}} generated by the questioning of O'Reilly's reporting during the Falklands War led to questions of claims made by O'Reilly while in El Salvador and Northern Ireland. In his 2013 book, Keep it Pithy, O'Reilly wrote: [...] "I've seen soldiers <b>gun</b> <b>down</b> unarmed civilians in Latin America, Irish terrorists kill and maim their fellow citizens in Belfast with bombs." [...] In a 2005 radio program O'Reilly said he had [...] "seen guys <b>gun</b> <b>down</b> nuns in El Salvador", and in 2012, on The O’Reilly Factor, said [...] "I saw nuns get {{shot in the back}} of the head". O'Reilly and Fox News clarified that he had not been an eyewitness to any of those events but had just seen photographs of the murdered nuns and Irish bombings.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1875, Beauford was {{the subject}} of a failed {{assassination}} attempt by Tonto Apache chief Disalin. Failing to kill John Clum and an agency clerk at the main building, Disalin made a last desperate bid to <b>gun</b> <b>down</b> the police chief. He found Beauford shortly after fleeing Clum's office. His first shot missed and, while moving closer to take a second shot, Disalin was shot and killed by an indian police officer. Four months later, while investigating reports of intruders [...] "prowling about the western border", he and a group of reservation police officers were involved in a gun battle which left 16 renegade Apaches dead. They brought 21 women and children back to San Carlos. Clum commended the actions of the officers and personally praised Beauford's abilities to Department of the Interior. He had a limited role in the concentration of Apaches from the Chiracahua and Fort Apache reservations at San Carlos.|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} first shown on April 10, {{at which time}} the {{controls}} were demonstrated. IGN were impressed; [...] "The pointing function works really well in Scarface. Just like the PC version's mouse control, players now have near pin-point weapon precision {{that makes it easier}} and more intuitive to <b>gun</b> <b>down</b> the opposition with the huge assortment of firepower within the experience. You can still target individuals to tighten up your aim using the Z button on the nunchuk, but because the Wii Remote's pointer already does a great job with its precision it's rare that we found ourselves using it." [...] GameSpot were less impressed; [...] "When you're wielding the chainsaw, its movement will be tied to that of the Wii Remote, and by slashing in different directions and at different heights you'll be able to target enemies' heads, legs, and individual arms. With practice you'll purportedly be able to remove all of the aforementioned extremities before the torso hits the ground, but the associate producer showing us the game on this occasion never managed to pull it off." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1901 Dunovant built a {{sugarcane}} refinery at the Cane Belt Railroad's Lakeside station. The strategically located {{facility was}} capable of producing 100 tons of sugar per day. At first the railroad was profitable, with $20,000 net profit in 1901. But the next year the company began to suffer from uneven cash flow and construction debt. A dispute over management of the railroad between Dunovant and Eldridge proved fatal. On August 11, 1902, Dunovant boarded the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway at Simonton. Eldridge, who was already aboard the train, immediately emptied his revolver into Dunovant and then smashed the <b>gun</b> <b>down</b> on his victim's skull. Dunovant, a Confederate veteran of the American Civil War who lost his left arm at the Battle of the Crater and who had previously threatened to kill Eldridge, did not survive the encounter. Before Eldridge could be brought to trial, Dunovant's partisans tried to exact revenge. On October 4, 1902, W.T. Cobb fired a shotgun blast at Eldridge but missed. Cobb was later acquitted.|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{cover is}} {{a photo of}} Amos holding a large rifle, sitting {{in a rocking chair}} on the porch of an old wooden building. One of her legs is out of her pants and flung {{over the side of the}} chair. A snake coils around the chair and a large rooster hangs from the roof of the porch. The image is a nod to her song [...] "Me and a Gun," [...] which appears on the album Little Earthquakes and recounts a rape she sustained. [...] "Well, it's [...] a {{reference}} to Me and a Gun, a song I wrote that was on Little Earthquakes. And the idea that there's a dead cock on my right and alive snake on my left.

2500|$|The {{operation}} had to {{be postponed}} for weather several times, but the 77-ship fleet, reinforced by the [...] and the small [...] , was in position {{on the morning of}} 7 September. Visibility was excellent everywhere but over the target which was covered by a haze, and Admiral Bacon ordered a withdrawal. German submarines and aircraft attacked as they were leaving, but the monitors took no damage. The monitors returned in the afternoon when the haze cleared and Lord Clive opened fire at 15:30 with a ranging shot on the Ostende lighthouse. However an hitherto unknown battery of four long-range [...] guns began to return fire and soon began to near-miss Lord Clive. She steamed out to sea to open up the range, but her speed was so slow that the Germans had no difficulties compensating for the additional range and she was hit four times in quick succession about 15:50. One hit on the port bulge aft, another alongside the bulge forward, one on the bow and another, that failed to explode, on the starboard two pounder gun, knocking the <b>gun</b> <b>down</b> to the quarterdeck. Only fourteen rounds were fired by the monitors before Admiral Bacon ordered them to retire, one of which set part of the dockyard on fire.|$|E
