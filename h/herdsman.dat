5|$|Skírnir {{requests}} that Freyr {{give him}} a horse and Freyr's sword; a sword which fights jötnar by itself. Under the cover of darkness, Skírnir rides the horse over nations and dew-covered mountains until he reaches Jötunheimr, {{the home of the}} jötnar, and proceeds to Gymir's courts. Ferocious dogs are tied before the wooden fence that surrounds Gerðr's hall. Skírnir rides out to a <b>herdsman</b> (unnamed) sitting on a mound, greets him, and asks the <b>herdsman</b> how he may speak to the maiden beyond Gymir's dogs. An exchange occurs between the <b>herdsman</b> and Skírnir, during which the <b>herdsman</b> tells Skírnir that he will never speak to the girl.|$|E

5|$|Folklorist John F. Campbell noted a {{story told}} on Islay, {{one of the}} Inner Hebridean islands, which {{demonstrates}} the usefulness of having a water bull. Just after a calf was born to an ordinary cow, an elderly lady, later identified as a witch, advised the <b>herdsman</b> to keep it separate from the other cattle, presumably after she noticed its deformed ears and suspected it was a water bull. She instructed the <b>herdsman</b> to rear the calf on milk from three different cows and to keep it confined in a stable {{for a minimum of}} seven years. Years later, a young woman was grazing cattle at a nearby loch when she was approached by an attractive man. He struck up a conversation with her and shortly afterwards the pair sat on the grass with his head resting in her lap, but as he fell asleep she discovered seaweed entwined in his hair, a sign that he was a water horse. She started to run back to the farm. Her suitor awoke, shapeshifted into his true equine form and chased after her. As the woman ran towards the farm, the witch shouted to the <b>herdsman</b> to release the water bull from the stable. The two creatures fought until they fell into the sea. The water horse never returned, but the remains of the bull were found the following day.|$|E

5000|$|Fulani herdsmen's {{engage in}} both random and planned {{transhumance}} movements. Random movements are usually {{taken by the}} pure nomadic Fulani <b>herdsmen</b> while planned movements are taken by the semi nomadic pastoralist. A primary reason for the migratory nature of the <b>herdsmen</b> is to reach areas with abundant grass and water for the cattle. The <b>herdsmen</b> also move to avoid tax collectors, harmful insects and hostile weather and social environment. A major benefit of the movement for the <b>herdsmen</b> is to maximize the availability food resources for the cattle and reduce excessive grazing.Before moving new areas, the <b>herdsmen</b> send a reconnaissance team to study the area for availability of resources such as grass and water.|$|R

5|$|The {{cattle egret}} was first {{described}} in 1758 by Linnaeus in his Systema naturae as Ardea ibis, but {{was moved to}} its current genus by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1855. Its genus name Bubulcus is Latin for <b>herdsman,</b> referring, like the English name, to this species' association with cattle. Ibis is a Latin and Greek word which originally referred to another white wading bird, the sacred ibis, but was applied to this species in error.|$|E
5|$|Philibert Rabezoza {{was born}} in 1923 in Ankadinandriana, a suburb of Antananarivo. His mother {{was born in}} Antananarivo and his father, a <b>herdsman</b> and farmer from Fianarantsoa, had {{previously}} been a singer at the Merina royal court before the colonization of Madagascar in 1897. Both of Philibert's parents were already aged {{at the time of}} his birth and they struggled to care for their new son alongside his six brothers and four sisters. As a child, Philibert assisted his family with looking after the livestock and farming their plot of land. In his early years he was given the nickname Rakoto by an older brother of the same name.|$|E

5000|$|Fulani <b>herdsmen</b> or Fulani pastoralists are nomadic or semi nomadic Fulani herders {{whose primary}} {{occupation}} is raising livestock.The pure Fulani pastoralist engages in random movement of cattle while the semi-nomadic makes transhumance migration {{and return to}} their camps or homes. The Fulani <b>herdsmen</b> are largely located in the Sahel and semi arid parts of West Africa but due to changes in climate patterns many <b>herdsmen</b> have moved further south into the savannah and tropical forest belt of West Africa. The <b>herdsmen</b> are found {{in countries such as}} Nigeria, Niger, Senegal, Guinea, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Benin, Cote d’Ivoire and Cameroon. In Senegal they inhabit northeastern Ferlo and the southeastern part of the country. In many of these countries the Fula often constitute a minority group.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{believed}} that the place was a dense forest years ago. A group of young <b>herdsmen,</b> while herding their cattle on the hilltop, lost one of their calves, and began praying to Lord Ayyapa for help. The legend says that Lord Ayyappa appeared before them and guided the lost calf back to the <b>herdsmen.</b> The idol the <b>herdsmen</b> worshipped became the deity of Njaralappuzha Dharmasastha [...] Reminding the endless love and compassion of Lord Ayyappa toward the helpless and poor, the sanctum sanctorum of Njaralappuzha temple even today stands without a roof.|$|R
5|$|The show's 15,000th episode {{focused on}} Ruth contemplating whether to consummate her affair with <b>herdsman</b> Sam Batton (Robin Pirongs), after believing David was having his own affair with his ex-girlfriend Sophie Barlow (Moir Leslie). Ruth {{ultimately}} chose {{to return home}} to her family. The storyline, which had begun in 2004, was heavily criticised by listeners, who inundated the BBC with complaints. Low listener figures were also attributed to the storyline, while the editor Vanessa Whitburn said the backlash helped keep Ruth faithful to David.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{can be kept}} {{extensively}} or intensively. Extensive systems involve animals roaming at will, {{or under}} the supervision of a <b>herdsman,</b> often for their protection from predators. Ranching in the Western United States involves large herds of cattle grazing widely over public and private lands. Similar cattle stations are found in South America, Australia and other places with large areas of land and low rainfall. Similar ranching systems have been used for sheep, deer, ostrich, emu, llama and alpaca. In the uplands of the United Kingdom, sheep are turned out on the fells in spring and graze the abundant mountain grasses untended, being brought to lower altitudes late in the year, with supplementary feeding being provided in winter. In rural locations, pigs and poultry can obtain much of their nutrition from scavenging, and in African communities, hens may live for months without being fed, and still produce one or two eggs a week.|$|E

25|$|Still, he {{knew that}} his mother was still alive and refused to attend the funeral at Corinth. To ease the tension, the {{messenger}} then said that Oedipus was, in fact, adopted. Jocasta, finally realizing that he was her son, begged him to stop his search for Laius' murderer. Oedipus misunderstood her motivation, thinking that she was ashamed of him because he might have been born of low birth. Jocasta in great distress went into the palace where she hanged herself. Oedipus sought verification of the messenger's story from the very same <b>herdsman</b> who was supposed to have left Oedipus to die as a baby. From the <b>herdsman,</b> Oedipus learned that the infant raised as the adopted son of Polybus and Merope was the son of Laius and Jocasta. Thus, Oedipus finally realized that the man he had killed so many years before, at the place where the three roads met, was his own father, King Laius, and that he had married his mother, Jocasta.|$|E

25|$|Creise {{along with}} Meall a' Bhuiridh, Stob Ghabhar and Stob a' Choire Odhair {{is one of}} the four Black Mount Munros, it reaches a height of 1100 metres (3609feet) and is a hill that is well known to skiers as well as walkers being {{situated}} next to the White Corries ski area from where it is often climbed along with adjoining Meall a' Bhuiridh. The two mountains are a popular traverse with cross-country skiers. The mountain is well seen from the A82 road and the Kings House Hotel, showing its steep and craggy northern buttress of Sròn na Creise. For many years the translated meaning of the mountains name from the Gaelic was unknown, however Irvine Butterfield now says that “creis” means grease or fat and refers to the rich grazing land around the hill which was used in the past by Glen Coe <b>herdsman</b> to fatten their cattle.|$|E
