5|$|Among the actinides, thorium and uranium are the <b>easiest</b> <b>to</b> isolate. Thorium is {{extracted}} mostly from monazite: thorium pyrophosphate (ThP2O7) is reacted with nitric acid, and the produced thorium nitrate treated with tributyl phosphate. Rare-earth impurities {{are separated by}} increasing the pH in sulfate solution.|$|E
5|$|Applications {{are often}} {{classified}} {{according to how}} often their subtasks need to synchronize or communicate with each other. An application exhibits fine-grained parallelism if its subtasks must communicate many times per second; it exhibits coarse-grained parallelism {{if they do not}} communicate many times per second, and it exhibits embarrassing parallelism if they rarely or never have to communicate. Embarrassingly parallel applications are considered the <b>easiest</b> <b>to</b> parallelize.|$|E
5|$|In a {{repairability}} review {{conducted by}} iFixit, the fourth-generation iPad scored 2 out of 10 (10 being the <b>easiest</b> <b>to</b> repair) {{due to the}} use of adhesive to attach components. However, reviewers noted that several components such as the screen and battery could be removed easily for replacement.|$|E

5|$|Klara: Marko's mother, {{who first}} appears with Marko's {{father at the}} end of issue #6. Her mother died in an {{incident}} at Langencamp at the hands of Landfallians, and thus Klara is less accepting of Marko and Alana's relationship. Brian K. Vaughan, when asked which character was his favorite, stated that Klara was the <b>easiest</b> <b>to</b> write.|$|E
5|$|Cowan and Hook {{suggest that}} Lucullus would have {{deployed}} the Romans in a simplex acies, {{that is to}} say a single line, so making the frontage of the army as wide as possible as a counter to the cavalry. He took several of his troops downriver, where the river was the <b>easiest</b> <b>to</b> ford, and at one moment, Tigranes believed that this move meant Lucullus was withdrawing from the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Probably the <b>easiest</b> <b>to</b> recycle {{would be}} bismuth-containing fusible alloys {{in the form}} of larger objects, then larger {{soldered}} objects. Half of the world's solder consumption is in electronics (i.e., circuit boards). As the soldered objects get smaller or contain little solder or little bismuth, the recovery gets progressively more difficult and less economic, although solder with a higher silver content will be more worthwhile recovering. Next in recycling feasibility would be sizeable catalysts with a fair bismuth content, perhaps as bismuth phosphomolybdate, and then bismuth used in galvanizing and as a free-machining metallurgical additive.|$|E

5|$|About twenty {{isotopes}} and six {{nuclear isomers}} (excited states of an isotope) of berkelium have been characterized with the mass numbers ranging from 235 to 254. All {{of them are}} radioactive. The longest half-lives are observed for 247Bk (1,380years), 248Bk (over300years) and 249Bk (330days); the half-lives of the other isotopes range from microseconds to several days. The isotope which is the <b>easiest</b> <b>to</b> synthesize is berkelium-249. This emits mostly soft β-particles which are inconvenient for detection. Its alpha radiation is rather weak – 1.45% {{with respect to the}} β-radiation – but is sometimes used to detect this isotope. The second important berkelium isotope, berkelium-247, is an alpha-emitter, as are most actinide isotopes.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other games}} in the genre, the player plays the main portion of Shiny Festa gameplay, Stage mode, {{as he or she}} listens to a {{selected}} song. Each song's performance is limited to a predetermined idol or group of idols, unlike the franchise's previous games. During a song, a predetermined sequence of note icons scroll along several lines, called Melody Lines, toward a central target icon. To complete a song, the player must press buttons that correspond to the direction from which the notes originate from—the buttons on the console's left and right halves for the PlayStation Portable version, and the left and right halves of the screen for the iOS version—as they pass over the target icon. The player is scored by these presses' accuracy in timing and direction, for which he or she is given one of four ratings: Perfect, Good, Normal, and Bad. The player's performance is also represented by the Sparkle Meter, which increases or decreases as the player successfully or fails to hit a note. Throughout the song, new target icons and lines may spawn at predetermined times in different locations of the screen to supersede or accompany old ones. The note sequences may also include Long Icons, which are streaks of notes that need to be continuously held down; Simultaneous Icons, which are pairs of icons that pass over the target icon simultaneously; and Shooting Stars, which appears once the Sparkle Meter is filled, and causes a Shining Burst that raises the player's score and changes the song's accompanying music video when it is hit. The complexity of the song's sequence varies based on the player's selected difficulty for the song; there are four difficulty levels: Debut, Normal, Pro, and Master from the <b>easiest</b> <b>to</b> the hardest.|$|E
