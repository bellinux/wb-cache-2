40|$|A {{cornerstone}} of New Zealand’s {{justice system is}} the principle of “open justice”. The courts {{are open to the}} public and the media is free to report on proceedings. The by product of this is the presumption against name suppression being granted, particularly in the criminal jurisdiction. This however was not always the case and for ten months between September 1975 and July 1976 blanket suppression of an accused’s name and <b>identifying</b> <b>particulars</b> until conviction, was a reality. This paper argues that a return to legislation of that kind is warranted particularly in light of the changing media landscape which includes instantatneous media reporting and the permanent effect of the internet. This author concludes that a return to liberal name suppression laws would not equate to an unjustified limitation on the freedom of expression, nor would it erode the principle of open justice...|$|E

50|$|Molecular mapping aids in {{identifying}} the location of particular markers within the genome. There {{are two types of}} maps that may be created for analysis of genetic material. First, is a physical map, that helps identify the location of where you are on a chromosome as well as which chromosome you are on. Secondly there is a linkage map that <b>identifies</b> how <b>particular</b> genes are linked to other genes on a chromosome. This linkage map may identify distances from other genes using (cM) centiMorgans as a unit of measurement. Co-dominant markers can be used in mapping, to <b>identify</b> <b>particular</b> locations within a genome and can represent differences in phenotype. Linkage of markers can help <b>identify</b> <b>particular</b> polymorphisms within the genome. These polymorphisms indicate slight changes within the genome that may present nucleotide substitutions or rearrangement of sequence. When developing a map it is beneficial to identify several polymorphic distinctions between two species as well as identify similar sequence between two species.|$|R
