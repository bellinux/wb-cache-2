50|$|When a <b>duress</b> <b>PIN</b> is used {{to trigger}} a silent alarm, an adversary can always request the PIN in advance and ensure the {{appropriately}} modified PIN is entered instead. If the adversary does not know which PIN is correct, they may choose randomly between the two possible codes allowing them to succeed half of the time.|$|E
5000|$|On older {{versions}} of SecurID, a [...] "duress PIN" [...] may be usedâ€”an alternate code which creates a security event log showing that a user {{was forced to}} enter their PIN, while still providing transparent authentication. Using the <b>duress</b> <b>PIN</b> would allow one successful authentication, after which the token will automatically be disabled. The [...] "duress PIN" [...] feature has been deprecated and is not available on currently supported versions.|$|E
50|$|A duress code is {{a covert}} {{distress}} signal used {{by an individual}} who is being coerced {{by one or more}} hostile persons. It is used to warn others that they are being forced to do something against their will. Typically, the warning is given via some innocuous signal embedded in normal communication, such as a code-word or phrase spoken during conversation to alert other personnel. Alternatively, the signal may be incorporated into the authentication process itself, typically {{in the form of a}} panic password, distress password, or <b>duress</b> <b>PIN</b> that is distinct from the user's normal password or PIN. These concepts are related to a panic alarm and often achieve the same outcome.|$|E
50|$|Some {{home and}} {{property}} alarm systems have <b>duress</b> <b>PINs,</b> where {{the last two}} digits of the reset code are switched around. Entering the code when under duress from an assailant can trigger a silent alarm, alerting police or security personnel in a covert manner. The implementation of this feature has not been without controversy, {{as it has been}} claimed to lead to false alarms. A similar mechanism, SafetyPIN, has been proposed for use in ATMs. In 2010, the Federal Trade Commission issued a report studying the viability of such mechanisms for ATMs. They noted <b>duress</b> <b>PINs</b> have never been actually implemented in any ATM, and conclude that the costs of deployment outweighs the likelihood they will actually deter criminal activity.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, {{an e-mail}} chain letter hoax {{circulated}} that claimed a reverse <b>PIN</b> <b>duress</b> code {{system is in}} place universally. American Banker reported on January 2, 2007 that no PIN-reversal duress code is used on any ATM as of that date. In September 2013 the hoax was still circulating in Australia with the text: ...|$|R
