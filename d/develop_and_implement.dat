25|$|Started in 2004 under President John B.

For 2010-11, Dover Area School District applied for and received $518,596 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district used the funding to provide full-day kindergarten and to <b>develop</b> <b>and</b> <b>implement</b> new curriculum.|$|E
25|$|UE also {{stood out}} in that period for its {{advocacy}} of equality for African American workers. In July 1950 UE leaders appointed Ernest Thompson, a black international representative and former rank-and-file factory worker, {{as secretary of the}} UE Fair Practices Committee. In essence the union's affirmative action officer, Thompson met with the leadership of UE locals around the country to <b>develop</b> <b>and</b> <b>implement</b> action plans to force employers to hire more black workers, and to give African Americans opportunities to advance into skilled trades jobs. In the midst of the Cold War assaults on UE, the union's newspaper reported such success stories as the promotion of a black worker at Johnson Machine to lathe operator. The company had insisted that this worker was unqualified and refused to train him, so white union members had taught him the job during their lunch breaks.|$|E
