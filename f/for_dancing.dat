5|$|In his {{personal}} life, Bolt expresses a love <b>for</b> <b>dancing</b> and his character is frequently described as laid-back and relaxed. His Jamaican {{track and field}} idols include Herb McKenley and former Jamaican 100m and 200m world record holder, Don Quarrie. Michael Johnson, the former 200 m world and Olympic record holder, is also held in high esteem by Bolt.|$|E
5|$|Barbadian folk dances {{include a}} wide variety of styles, {{performed}} at Landship, holidays and other occasions. Dancers and other performers at the crop over festivals, for example, are popular and an iconic part of Barbadian culture, known <b>for</b> <b>dancing</b> in the costumes of sugarcane-cutters. The Landship movement features song and dance meant to imitate the passage of a British navy ship through rough seas; Landship and other occasions also feature African-derived improvised and complexly-rhythmic dances, and British hornpipes, jigs, maypole dances and Marches.|$|E
5|$|Beechwood Theater, {{a replica}} of the Little Theater on Broadway, was {{included}} in Wells Bosworth's design of the primary school building because Vanderlip particularly wanted his own theater. Beechwood Theater, with 256 gold velvet seats, was designed by Winthrop Ames around 1917. Details were closely examined upon construction; the lighting equipment, the scene lofts and fly gallery, and the dressing rooms were well-designed and state-of-the-art. The stage floor was designed especially <b>for</b> <b>dancing,</b> and the acoustics and theater proportions made varieties of productions possible.|$|E
40|$|People {{all over}} the world dance {{traditional}} and popular dances that have been staged for purposes of representing specific national and ethnic groups. Anthony Shay suggests these staged dance productions be called “ethno identity dances”, especially to replace the term “folk dance,” which Shay suggests should refer to the traditional dances found in village settings as an organic part of village and tribal life. Shay investigates the many motives that impel people to dance in these staged productions: <b>dancing</b> <b>for</b> sex or <b>dancing</b> sexy dances, <b>dancing</b> <b>for</b> fun and recreation, <b>dancing</b> <b>for</b> profit - such as <b>dancing</b> <b>for</b> tourists - <b>dancing</b> <b>for</b> the nation or to demonstrate ethnic pride. In this study Shay also examines belly dance, Zorba Dancing in Greek nightclubs and restaurants, Tango, Hula, Irish step dancing, and Ukrainian dancing. [URL]...|$|R

5|$|Hilarion, a local gamekeeper, {{is also in}} {{love with}} Giselle and is highly {{suspicious}} of the newcomer who has won Giselle's affections. He tries to convince the naive Giselle that her beau cannot be trusted, but she ignores his warnings. Giselle's mother, Berthe, is very protective of her daughter, as Giselle has a weak heart that leaves her in delicate health. She discourages a relationship between Giselle and Loys, and disapproves of Giselle's fondness <b>for</b> <b>dancing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Doggett first {{appears in}} the fifth episode. She wishes to hang up a cross in Litchfield Penitentiary's chapel but is refused permission. She ignores this and hangs her cross up on a light fixture; this causes the entire fixture to fall down and hence damages the chapel's ceiling. She also {{displays}} transphobia; calling the transgender woman Sophia Burset (played by Laverne Cox) an 'abomination' and 'it' and blaming her for {{the damage to the}} chapel. Doggett has numerous clashes with Alex Vause (played by Laura Prepon); firstly Vause threatens to rape Doggett after growing tired of her complaining about Piper Chapman (played by Taylor Schilling); Doggett locks Vause in a dryer while she is helping Chapman to fix it and, lastly, Doggett snitches on Chapman and Vause <b>for</b> <b>dancing</b> provocatively with each other; resulting in Chapman being placed in solitary confinement.|$|E
5|$|Food Circus: The Food Circus was a {{food court}} in the former armory, later named the Center House, and {{recently}} renamed The Armory (2012) as a remodel of the building continues. Unlike the current arrangement with a stage and a large open space <b>for</b> <b>dancing,</b> events, and temporary booths, many food booths {{were in the middle}} of the room as well as at the edges. There were 52concessionaires in all, nine of them with exhibits in addition to their food for sale. Beginning in 1963, the Food Circus also housed a variety of museums, including Jones' Fantastic Show, the Jules Charbneau World of Miniatures, and the Pullen Klondike Museum.|$|E

5|$|The March 2008 {{release of}} Donnant-Donnant celebrated Jaojoby's roots as a cabaret {{performer}} of soul, funk, and other Western popular genres. The track listing included previously unreleased pop songs {{written by the}} artist in the 1970s and 1980s in French, Malagasy, Creole, and English. Later that year, in September, he became the second Malagasy musical act (after supergroup Mahaleo, in 2007) to perform at the prestigious and historic Olympia music hall in Paris. Seating was specially removed at his request to provide space <b>for</b> <b>dancing.</b> The live album Live au Bato Fou: Jaojoby was released in 2010 and features a diverse sampling of Jaojoby's greatest hits. A selection of new salegy tracks written and performed by Jaojoby was released in 2012 under the album title Mila Anao, which was ranked by NPR {{as one of the}} ten best international albums of the year.|$|E
5|$|The {{budget of}} about £1million per episode (totalling US$9.6million) allowed 20 {{shooting}} weeks of {{five days to}} film six 55-minute episodes. Production aimed for 10.5-hour shooting days plus time for costume and make-up. Two weeks before filming began, about 70 of {{the cast and crew}} gathered for the script read-through, followed by rehearsals, lessons <b>for</b> <b>dancing,</b> horse-riding, fencing, and other skills that needed to be ready ahead of the actual filming. Filming took place between June 1994 and 1 November 1994 to reflect the changing seasons in the plot, followed by post-production until mid-May 1995. Scenes in the same place were grouped in the filming schedule.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of 4 consists of mid-tempo pieces, {{but unlike the}} filler that might have occupied this pacing on previous albums, many of this album’s greatest strengths lie in this realm. Perhaps best exemplifying this spirit is the André 3000 and Kanye West assisted, 'Party' in which Beyoncé relaxes into a beat that, while {{not be easy to}} grind to, still works perfectly as a party anthem. Beyoncé reminds us that a party is not only meant <b>for</b> <b>dancing.</b> It is a place where you go to enjoy the company of others and oftentimes, that involves real human conversation and interaction. Echoing this sentiment, André’s verse is tranquilized from his customarily rapid-fire delivery to a drawl more reminiscent of Lil’ Wayne than his traditional work with Outkast. 'Party' like much of 4, is a conversation, and André 3000 wants to be heard.|$|E

5|$|Several {{media outlets}} {{attempted}} {{to place the}} work within a particular genre. MTV compared the song's style to the group Devo and new wave music. El País described the piece as an electropop song {{that contributed to the}} viral spread of the Christian Bale rant after its release on the Internet. Dose described it as an electro jam session which made adept use of sampling from the audio of Bale's rhetoric. The Los Angeles Times called the piece a lively pop music tribute to the actor. USA Today called the song fun dance music and creatively motivated. The Toronto Sun praised its original lyrics and use of audio from the incident, and described the piece as a fusion of electro-pop styles and a good song <b>for</b> <b>dancing.</b> New Musical Express recommended the piece, and described it as electro-rock which astutely sampled Bale throughout the song. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch described the piece as a form of new wave music which used the most spasmodic segments of the incident, and commented that the end product was comedic. The Arizona Daily Star described the piece as a pop music dance song.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Baltimore {{was home to}} several African American classically {{oriented}} music institutions which drew on a rich tradition of symphonic music, chamber concerts, oratorios, documented {{in large part by}} the Baltimore Afro-American, a local periodical. Inspired by A. Jack Thomas, who had been appointed conductor of the city's municipally supported African American performance groups, Charles L. Harris led the Baltimore Colored Chorus and Symphony Orchestra from 1929 to 1939, when a strike led to the company's dissolution. Thomas {{had been one of the}} first black bandleaders in the U.S. Army, was director of the music department at Morgan College, and was the founder of Baltimore's interracial Aeolian Institute for higher musical education. Charles L. Harris, as leader of the Baltimore Colored City Band, took his group to black neighborhoods across Baltimore, playing marches, waltzes and other music, then switch to jazz-like music with an upbeat tempo, meant <b>for</b> <b>dancing.</b> Some of Harris' musicians also played in early jazz clubs, though the musical establishment at the time did not readily accept the style. Fred Huber, Director of Municipal Music for Baltimore, exerted powerful control over the repertoire of these bands, and forbade jazz. T. Henderson Kerr, a prominent black bandleader, emphasized in his advertising that his group did not play jazz, while the prestigious Peabody Institute debated whether jazz was music at all. The Symphony Orchestra produced renowned pianist Ellis Larkins and cellist W. Llewellyn Wilson, also the music critic for the Afro-American. Harris eventually replaced Harris as conductor of the Orchestra and has since become a city musical fixture who is said to have, at one point, taught every single African American music teacher in Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|Mercy {{learns that}} she {{can stay in the}} UK but feels guilty about the deception, so decides to go back to Nigeria anyway. Fatboy loses his market stall but gets a job selling cars for Max Branning (Jake Wood). He discovers Mercy is leaving, so tries to stop her from leaving but is unable to, and they say an {{emotional}} goodbye. Fatboy is distraught over his loss, and eventually decides to move in with Dot. He helps Dot to track down her half sister Rose Cotton (Polly Perkins) and helps Whitney when her former pimp, Rob Grayson (Jody Latham) tracks her down. Fatboy feels put out when Rose and Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) both move in with Dot. Mercy's sister Faith Olubunmi (Modupe Adeyeye) then arrives in Walford to tell Fatboy that Mercy has had their marriage annulled. Fatboy starts a relationship with Faith (as seen in series 3 of EastEnders: E20) but it soon ends. Following this, Fatboy develops feelings for his friend Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), though Whitney is involved with Tyler Moon (Tony Discipline). When Whitney and Tyler's relationship breaks down, Fatboy admits his feelings for Whitney and the pair start a relationship. Fatboy buys a car for Whitney, but she is initially angry, saying she doesn't want to be owned. However, Whitney relents and accepts the gift. Fatboy notices that Tyler continues to want Whitney, and so warns him off. However, after Whitney gets angry at Lucy (now Hetti Bywater) <b>for</b> <b>dancing</b> with Fatboy, Lucy convinces Tyler to talk to her. They accidentally get locked in a bathroom and Fatboy assumes Whitney has cheated on him, so ends the relationship. Fatboy later visits Tyler, who shows Fatboy that the bathroom door sticks, and Tyler says that he is happy for Fatboy and Whitney as a couple. However, Whitney soon feels smothered by Fatboy's affection, and when he is about to take Whitney away on holiday, she refuses, and when they kiss she says it is like kissing a friend. She admits that she wants Tyler, and Fatboy is heartbroken. He later punches Tyler. He then becomes a regular DJ at R, and gets a job at the local fast food restaurant, McKlunkies. However, he is sacked when he stands up to his manager, Nico Papadopoulos (Aykut Hilmi) after taking advice from Alfie Moon (Shane Richie). Alfie feels bad so offers Fatboy a job at The Queen Victoria public house, collecting glasses.|$|E
