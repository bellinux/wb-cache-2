50|$|This {{transmission}} has {{a separate}} oil for the differential in the transmission, {{so there are}} two fluid levels to check. The differential fluid is checked by unscrewing the speed sensor gear assembly {{and use it as}} a dipstick. The speed sensor gear assembly is located on top of the transmission just above the right <b>inner</b> <b>CV</b> <b>joint.</b> Differential is emptied by removing the final drive cover on the rear of the transmission or by vacuum extraction through the speed sensor hole. Vacuum extraction is the more attractive option since a paper gasket seals the steel cover and access is very difficult. Filling is through the speed sensor hole. Differential oil capacity is about 1 liter. An acceptable differential oil is Redline synthetic MT-90 75W90 gear oil or any synthetic 75W90 GL4 gear oil. Be very careful not to introduce sand or dust into the differential, as the differential has no way to filter its oil.|$|E

40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Winter 2007 The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has {{developed}} a hydraulic hybrid system for delivery trucks. The barrel-valveplate is a component that is frequently changed due to constant tests to the proprietary bent-axis Gen 2 pumps of the hydraulic system. Installation of the barrel-valveplate includes aligning piston-con-rod assemblies into barrel bores, aligning and mating <b>CV</b> <b>joint</b> assemblies, and the installation of a backplate assembly. The <b>CV</b> <b>joint</b> installation is very difficult due to the piston-con-rod assemblies surrounding it. Thus, Dr. Mike Delduca, from the EPA contacted us to design a removable tool that will facilitate <b>CV</b> <b>joint</b> alignment and reduce the alignment time to less than two minutes...|$|R
50|$|Constant-velocity joints (AKA homokinetic or <b>CV</b> <b>joints)</b> allow a {{drive shaft}} to {{transmit}} power through a variable angle, at constant rotational speed, without an appreciable increase in friction or play. They are mainly used in {{front wheel drive}} vehicles, and many modern rear wheel drive cars with independent rear suspension typically use <b>CV</b> <b>joints</b> {{at the ends of}} the rear axle halfshafts and increasingly use them on the drive shafts.|$|R
40|$|Constant {{velocity}} (<b>CV)</b> <b>joints</b> {{have been}} widely used for modern vehicles. The sealed grease of <b>CV</b> <b>joints</b> must pro-vide low friction and wear protection for the lifetime use of the vehicle. Grease performance affects the vibration and noise level in the vehicle. Vehicles that have traveled long distances may suffer mechanical and thermal overloads, thus causing the grease to degrade due to changes in its physical and chemical properties. In this article, the grease degradation phenomenon in <b>CV</b> <b>joints</b> is investigated by collecting grease samples from both tripod joints and Birfield joints in actual vehicles that traveled various ranges of distance. In order to analyze the property changes of grease, grease penetration and oxidation induced time are measured using a penetration meter and infrared (IR) spectrometer, respectively. Where oxygen in-duced time (OIT) is the point that the oxidation occurs in grease. The performance variations of grease are investigated by measuring the friction and wear using linear-oscillation (SRV, Schwingung (oscillation) Reibung (friction) Verschleiss (wear)) test machine as well as the four-ball wear tester. Degra-dation of properties as well as performance in <b>CV</b> <b>joint</b> grease due to physical and/or chemical changes is identified...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} for the <b>CV</b> <b>Joint</b> Test Stand Thesis is {{to design}} and develop a test stand {{that will allow the}} ability to test a constant velocity (<b>CV)</b> <b>joint</b> with a computer interface for data collection. This thesis concentrates on two separate sections, one is the specification of equipment and computer program for data collection, and the second is a moderate outlook on signature analysis of the system. The APRA (Automotive Parts Rebuilders Association) along with the National Center for Remanufacturing and Resource Recovery (NCRRR) are dedicated to the quality and the need for better remanufacturing techniques. The specification of the equipment includes instruments such as an infrared thermocouple, accelerometer, microphone, and a magnetic particle brake. The infrared (IR) thermocouple will be used to check the temperature of the <b>CV</b> <b>Joint.</b> This type of thermocouple was chosen since it {{does not need to be}} permanently mounted on the object it is reading. An accelerometer is used to provide vibration analysis information for the system. The magnetic particle brake will be needed to provide a torque to simulate road like-conditions and to accurately investigate the system. The computer interface will utilize Labview to control and monitor the system during operation. Programming will be done in Labview to complete these tasks. Data files can then be exported to Matlab for further analysis. Finally, a conservative look at the signature analysis of the system will be done to try and correlate <b>CV</b> <b>joint</b> ball wear with noise. No attempt will be made to correlate <b>CV</b> <b>joint</b> wear with temperature and/or vibration at this time. However, this instrumentation can be used for future research...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A <b>CV</b> <b>joint</b> {{outer race}} is an {{important}} load-supporting part in cars. Its geometry is very complicated. Traditional hot and cold forging methods have their own limitations to produce such a complex shaped part. Therefore, multistage forging may be advantageous to produce this part. The key point of outer race is performing the geometry of ball grooves with negative slope angle. Traditional methods form the ball groove by machining that takes long time and waste many portions of the material. Thus near net shape forging is an attractive option for producing of outer race. In this study, the process sequence in the multistage forging of a <b>CV</b> <b>joint</b> outer race has been investigated by using the rigid plastic finite volume method and forging process sequence is designed which can produce a near net-shape housing without defects within a given press capacity. Finally physical modelling with commercial lead is used to verify the reliability of numerical simulation results...|$|R
50|$|Around the 100 mi mark, several {{cars were}} {{dropping}} out of contention. Kevin Cogan blew an engine, Randy Lewis dropped out, and Michael Andretti broke a <b>CV</b> <b>joint,</b> then had a pit fire. On lap 34, Bobby Rahal, who had been running as high as second, made an unscheduled, five-minute long pit stop due to an electrical problem. After several long stops, Rahal would eventually drop out.|$|R

50|$|Modern {{front-wheel drive}} cars {{typically}} combine the transmission (gearbox and differential) and front axle {{into a single}} unit called a transaxle. The drive axle is a split axle with a differential and universal joints between the two half axles. Each half axle connects to the wheel by use of a constant velocity (<b>CV)</b> <b>joint</b> which allows the wheel assembly to move freely vertically {{as well as to}} pivot when making turns.|$|R
50|$|A double Cardan joint {{consists}} of two universal joints mounted back to back with a center yoke; the center yoke replaces the intermediate shaft. Provided that the angle between the input shaft and center yoke {{is equal to the}} angle between the center yoke and the output shaft, the second Cardan joint will cancel the velocity errors introduced by the first Cardan joint and the aligned double Cardan joint will act as a <b>CV</b> <b>joint.</b>|$|R

50|$|Clutch delay valves {{operate on}} the {{principle}} that engagement only needs to occur at a certain rate to be efficient and that engaging at a quicker rate can damage the drive train components of an automobile. Engaging the drive train to the engine too quickly can damage drive train parts, including the transmission, differential, half shafts, axles, and <b>CV</b> <b>joints.</b> Engaging the drive train too slowly can damage the clutch friction disc and cause clutch slippage.|$|R
50|$|Retirements {{may also}} occur due to {{mechanical}} problems. If a car suffers mechanical problems, it will {{pull into the}} pits and remain there {{for the rest of}} the race.

40|$|Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Winter 2006 The {{hydraulic}} pump and motor {{group of the}} EPA at the National Vehicle Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor has been doing research and design of hydraulic hybrid vehicles using hydraulic pistons pumps, particularly bent axis pumps, {{to assist in the}} propulsion of automobiles. The pump consists of two halves which are rotating and at angles to each other, causing the pump to require the use of a <b>CV</b> <b>Joint.</b> Due to durability issues encountered during testing, the EPA has asked us to create a fixture that will measure the lash in the <b>CV</b> <b>joint</b> throughout its angular operating range. The key requirements of this project are the precise alignment of the joint, as well as the accuracy of the measurements. The EPA requires us to have measurement accuracies of up to 0. 1 degrees in some of our measurements and to align certain joint surfaces to within. 010 in.
