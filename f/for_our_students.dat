2500|$|Although Chancellor Wrighton {{had noted}} after the 2004 debate {{that it would}} be [...] "improbable" [...] that the {{university}} will host another debate and was not eager to commit to the possibility, he subsequently changed his view and the university submitted a bid for the 2008 debates. [...] "These one-of-a-kind events are great experiences <b>for</b> <b>our</b> <b>students,</b> they contribute to a national understanding of important issues, and they allow us to help bring national and international attention to the St. Louis region as one of America's great metropolitan areas," [...] said Wrighton.|$|E
2500|$|Plans {{for a new}} {{skyscraper}} were unveiled {{to accommodate}} increasing enrollment numbers, and the school ranks fifth {{in the country in}} placing its graduates at top-shelf law firms. [...] But Treanor is not just concerned with growth and reputation. [...] Like the law deans of Harvard (which built a state-of-the-art law student gym, limited class size to 80 students, and mandated individualized written feedback for every student in every course throughout the semester), and Yale (which abandoned the traditional law school grading system, does not rank its students, and has only one semester of required classes), Treanor has attempted to address the students' quality of life. [...] In a 2006 interview, Treanor reported instituting free cupcakes and ice cream to alleviate the intensity of law school finals. [...] Gifts to students, though, are in the offing: At the end of the 2006 academic year, Treanor worked for the purveyance of free flip-flops with Fordham's imprint on the bottom. [...] "I feel obliged to make the Fordham experience <b>for</b> <b>our</b> <b>students</b> as special as possible," [...] said Treanor. [...] Fordham maintains a strict grading curve policy, class rankings, and a year-long 1L curriculum.|$|E

40|$|As I {{look at my}} {{fifth year}} as Dean of Hamline University School of Law, I am often struck by the dissonance between my {{professional}} life, as a lawyer and law professor, and my administrative life, as a dean within a small university.

I am a product of my unique practice and academic experience. An entertainment lawyer by disposition, my field includes a broad array of intellectual property law and the arts or business organizations which exploit these rights. Perhaps blinded by my professional background, I believe that to make a difference, we must learn from these fields to make a difference <b>for</b> <b>our</b> schools, <b>students,</b> institutions, and communities.
