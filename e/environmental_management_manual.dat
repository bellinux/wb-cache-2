40|$|Environmental {{management}} system (EMS) comprises of management practices that helps an organization {{to assess their}} level of efficiencies in meeting the environmental responsibilities. EMS involves listing of all environmental legislations, all environmental effects associated with activities, setting targets, keeping appropriate records and undertaking regular reviews of organization for sound environmental performance. The core elements of EMS include environmental policy, environmental action plan, environment related organizational structures and integration of environmental concerns. The main benefits of EMS are improved environmental performance, enhanced compliance, pollution prevention, improve efficiency, enhanced image in public and also enhanced environmental awareness. Certification for EMS by an organization can be obtained when at least its EMS is operational {{for a minimum of}} three months and after conducting audits by certification body. The documentation for EMS is must and it should make clear relationship of {{management system}} in operation of entity within organization which is subjected to certification. An <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> <b>manual</b> is a key document for EMS as it contains environmental policies and clearly defines duties of a person in charge of verification of activities in organization, it also contains list of all procedures.

40|$|Environmental {{management}} {{has become a}} part of societal life and a dominant issue for every sector of economies in the developed world. However, due to the absence of EMS the Libyan petroleum companies are not able to compete in the international petroleum sector. The rules and regulations specified by developed countries concerning environmental protection are becoming highly challenging. These have posed tremendous difficulties for both the government of Libya, as well as the petroleum companies to meet the national and international legislative requirements. Since 1999, Libya has been transformed by aligning itself according to the requirements and expectations of the industrial nations of the world and has, therefore, in this process of transformation, already become one of the competitive nations in the petroleum sector. The country has started to attract international investment by companies and individuals from all over the world. The change of Libyan economic policy towards open markets and the signing of many international agreements incorporating legal concerns related to biodiversity, climate change, endangered species, hazardous wastes, marine dumping, and ozone layer protection in their system. This has subsequently enabled the Libyan petroleum industry to make efforts to set up some basic procedures to improve environmental performance. This is an enormous interdisciplinary work, which requires a lot of effort. The present work aims to introduce an internationally accepted environmental management system according to the ISO 14001 standard to enable the oil industry remove the prevalent deficiencies as far as environmental management is concerned in the industry. This work uses AGOCO as a model company for case study analyses, which would provide an excellent opportunity for the implementation of EMS in accordance with ISO 14001 in all petroleum companies of Libya. The detailed analysis is based on the cumulative assessment of the current <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> <b>manual</b> of AGOCO, interviews with some of the company’s personnel and telephone communications with some employees of the company. The analysis reveals the strengths and weaknesses in the concerning EMS planning, implementation, checking and review. Using AGOCO as a benchmark for all other petroleum companies, the work has resulted in the formulation of procedures to be followed by the other companies in compliance with the international standards...|$|E

L., con el fin de que dicho centro pueda obtener una ventaja competitiva, respecto de otros centros ubicados próximamente, dada la fuerte competencia existente. Con la implantación de un Sistema de Gestión Medioambiental y más concretamente la ISO 14001, se puede conseguir una mejora de la imagen de la empresa, un ahorro de costes, se pueden mejorar las relaciones con la Administración e incluso con las entidades financieras, se puede contribuir a la motivación de los trabajadores, se asegura el cumplimiento de la legislación ambiental. La actividad que nos ocupa, se dedica a la recepción y descontaminación de vehículos al final de su vida útil, reutilizando piezas o componentes de recambio., Los objetivos del presente trabajo van a ser fundamentalmente, el implantar el Manual de Gestión Ambiental en la planta de tratamiento de vehículos fuera de uso y el describir todos los procedimientos genéricos a seguir. Como conclusiones de este trabajo, tendremos las auditorías con las no conformidades detectadas, así como el compromiso adquirido en todos los niveles y departamentos de la empresa, lo cual se traducirá en una mejor satisfacción de los clientes y por tanto un aumento en el número de vehículos a tratar.

The documented risk-based SEMS approach developed is essentially a “bottom-up approach” and enables fishermen to understand their operations and demonstrate they are responsible, while empowering the operator to communicate confidently and effectively. Experience has shown that this process has lead to fishermen realizing that by taking a responsible approach, they can positively influence the management process. This helps them to maintain access to the natural resource while also allowing them to engage in certification programmes that bring market rewards. This documented management system allows an operator undergo audit procedures in a constructive and easily achievable manner, such as MSC requirements within a fishery and also operator–based, regional standards. The success and sense of personal achievement gained through third party validation of fishermen’s efforts has resulted in a sustained and continuous growth on a journey that will ensure a long-term commitment by the catching sector to responsible practices. This paper highlights the approach to assist and empower the Irish catching sector embrace positive change, through adoption of an EMS approach which has proved to be an important tool for encouraging sustainable and responsible practices...|$|R

The principal regulations for chemical tracking are the Emergency Planning Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) and the California Right-to-Know regulations. The regulations, the Hazard Communication/Lab Standard of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) are also key to the CM Program.

This is of particular importance when <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> no longer relies solely on an individual firm's efforts, but on its supply chain partners as well. Building on dynamic capabilities theory, environmental information integration (EII) is defined as the organizational capacity of sharing information on <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> with supply chain partners to facilitate coordination of <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> practices. This study examines how EII contributes to <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> capabilities in terms of corporate environmental innovativeness and adaptability. The research model is empirically tested using data collected from 230 firms. The findings show that supplier EII is insufficient in improving <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> capabilities. Internal EII contributes to corporate environmental adaptability, while customer EII engenders both corporate environmental innovativeness and adaptability. This study suggests that strategic values of EII go beyond the sharing of <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> information between supply chain partners, simultaneously contributing to the <b>environmental</b> <b>management</b> capabilities of firms.
