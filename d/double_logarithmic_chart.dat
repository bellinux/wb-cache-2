40|$|Using a perturbative {{model for}} diffractive interactions, we derive an {{expression}} for the polarized diffractive structure function $g_ 1 ^D$ {{in the high}} energy limit. This structure function is given by the interference of diffractive amplitudes with polarized and unpolarized exchanges. For the polarized exchange we consider both two-gluon and quark-antiquark amplitudes. The polarized diffractive amplitude receives sizable contributions from non-strongly ordered regions in phase space, resulting in a <b>double</b> <b>logarithmic</b> enhancement at small $x$. The resummation of these <b>double</b> <b>logarithmic</b> terms is outlined. We also discuss the transition from our perturbative expression to the nonperturbative region.
