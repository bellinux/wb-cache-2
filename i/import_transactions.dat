500|$|Economists {{from the}} University of Tennessee {{concluded}} {{that while there}} would be many desirable macroeconomic effects, adoption of a national retail sales tax would also have serious effects on {{state and local government}} finances. Economist Bruce Bartlett stated that if the states did not conform to the FairTax, they would have massive confusion and complication as to what is taxed by the state and what is taxed by the federal government. In addition, sales taxes have long exempted all but a few services because of the enormous difficulty in taxing intangibles—Bartlett suggests that the state may not have sufficient incentive to enforce the tax. University of Michigan economist Joel Slemrod argues that states would face significant issues in enforcing the tax. [...] "Even at an average rate of around five percent, state sales taxes are difficult to administer." [...] University of Virginia School of Law professor George Yin states that the FairTax could have evasion issues with export and <b>import</b> <b>transactions.</b> The President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform reported that if the federal government were to cease taxing income, states might choose to shift their revenue-raising to income. Absent the Internal Revenue Service, it would be more difficult for the states to maintain viable income tax systems.|$|E

40|$|When {{transactions}} are complicated or {{are carried out}} {{for the purposes of}} tax planning, the need to determine whether they have been correctly characterised may arise in some situations. The general position is that however transactions have been classified, taxation should be based on their “true import”. One overall conclusion is that in addition to classification in accordance with the norms of private law, the true <b>import</b> of <b>transactions</b> may also be determined in accordance with specific tax law provisions or normative tax law principles. The support for a tax charge varies depending on the norm type, as do the methods of     interpretation. The thesis presents the methodological principles on which determination of true import should be based. It has proved essential to examine possible lex lata conclusions regarding the scope of the different norm types, particularly bearing in mind rule of law considerations. The material examined largely comprises income tax case law on taxation based on the true <b>import</b> of <b>transactions.</b> Much of the work has consisted of systemising this case law. Analyses are made and conclusions drawn as to how the Supreme Administrative Court determines the true <b>import</b> of <b>transactions</b> in general, and in particular as regards “composite” chains of transactions. The methodological principles on which determination of true import should be based and the conclusions as to how the Supreme Administrative Court determines the true <b>import</b> of <b>transactions</b> are applied to a specifically selected chain of events. In addition, an examination is made and conclusions drawn as to whether there is support for a substance-over-form approach in Swedish tax law, or whether private law sets the precedent for tax law, whether the taxpayer’s desire to achieve tax advantages should be taken into account, the importance of the economic effect when determining the true <b>import</b> of <b>transactions,</b> and whether assessments can be made both to the advantage of taxpayers and to their detriment...|$|R

50|$|Inflation {{continued}} to eat {{away at the}} cedi's value on the black market. In the early 1980s, the government started cracking {{down hard on the}} retail of products at prices other than the official established sale price (price controls). This had the effect of driving nearly all commerce underground, where black market prices for commodities were the norm, and nothing existed on store shelves. By 1983 the cedi was worth about 120 to one U.S. dollar on the black market, a pack of cigarettes cost about ₵150 (if they could be found), but the bank rate continued at ₵2.80 = $1.00. Finally, with foreign currency completely drying up for all <b>import</b> <b>transactions,</b> the government was forced to begin a process of gradual devaluation, and a liberalization of its strict price controls. This process ended in 1990 with a free float of the cedi against foreign currencies. Inflation continued (see exchange rate chart) until by July 2007, the cedi was worth about 9500 to one US dollar, and a transition to the third cedi was initiated.|$|E
50|$|After a short respite in 1991-1996, when {{measures}} taken in 1993 led to economic stabilization, a relatively stable exchange rate, low inflation, sustainable fiscal policies, and growth, Suriname's economic situation deteriorated from 1996 to the present. This {{was due in}} large part to loose fiscal policies of the Wijdenbosch government, which, in the face of lower Dutch development aid, financed its deficit through credit extended by the central bank. As a consequence, the parallel market for foreign exchange soared so that by the end of 1998, the premium of the parallel market rate over the official rate was 85%. Since over 90% of <b>import</b> <b>transactions</b> took place at the parallel rate, inflation took off, with 12-month inflation growing from 0.5% at the end of 1996, to 23% at the end of 1998, and 113% at the end of 1999. The government also instituted a regime of stringent economic controls over prices, the exchange rate, imports, and exports, in an effort to contain the adverse efforts of its economic policies. The cumulative impact of soaring inflation, an unstable exchange rate, and falling real incomes led to a political crisis.|$|E

40|$|A key {{emerging}} insight {{in international}} economics {{is that the}} scope for quality differentiation can help to explain patterns in export prices {{at the level of}} products or firms. In this paper, a unified theoretical framework of firm heterogeneity in cost and quality is brought to bear on an expansive data set of U.

The higher moments of the price distribution are used to identify the scope for quality differentiation at the detailed product level; highly differentiated products account for about half of U. S. import value. The product classification is then used to evaluate two claims in the nascent firm-level trade quality literature. First, the positive link between exporter capability and price is found to depend {{on the nature of the}} product: productive exporters simultaneously specialize in high-priced varieties in quality differentiated goods and low-priced varieties in more homogeneous goods. Second, a novel time series test documents firm sorting into export markets according to output quality. Imports - Prices...|$|R

Brouthers (2002) examined performance outcomes by integrating transaction cost and institutional perspectives.
