5000|$|The {{vessel was}} {{propelled}} {{by a large}} triple expansion steam engine built by Wallsend Shipway and Engineering Co., which drove a single propeller. Official top speed was recorded as 15.8 kn, although Yongala was recorded to have reached 17 kn on multiple occasions. Five single ended steel boilers working under natural draught supplied steam of [...] pressure. At 15 knots, Yongalas engines burned approximately 67 tonnes of coal per day. A direct acting steam windlass and capstan was fitted on the forecastle head. Cargo handling was done with two steam cranes, along with seven winches with derricks and derrick-posts. Electric lighting was fitted throughout the ship with a duplicate generating plant. She was also provided with refrigeration facilities for the carriage of frozen cargo. A specially arranged steam and <b>hand</b> <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> was fitted in a house at the after end of the fantail and controlled from the bridge.|$|E

50|$|The riverboat was {{described}} on the builders certificate as having three decks, and one mast, and was cutter rigged. She was clincher built with an elliptical stern and straight stem. Her length was 115.5 feet, main breadth 23.1 feet, with depth in hold from tonnage deck to ceiling amidships, 4.45 feet. Her gross tonnage was 178.29 tons and net register tonnage 121.24 tons. She had two decks, the main deck was of steel and the promenade deck of teak which did not run the whole length of the vessel. The third deck or sun deck was to be laid on her arrival in Brazil. The space between these decks was boarded up for the voyage. The vessel had vertical surface condensing twin screw engines of 350 estimated horse power, designed {{to give her a}} speed of 11 or 11 1/2 knots. She had one single-ended return tube boiler fired from the foremost end, loaded to 150 lbs. pressure. She was fitted with both <b>hand</b> and steam <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> worked from the fore end of the promenade deck by means of chains and rods to the rudder head which was carried up to that level.|$|R

A combined steam and <b>hand</b> <b>steering</b> engine was also located aft, and this was controlled by a telemotor gear from the navigating bridge. There was also a powerful <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> situated forward, the purpose of which was to operate a bow rudder so as to facilitate the quick turning and manoeuvring of the vessel when entering or leaving port.For the stern rudder there was a combined steam and hand gear.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The rudder and <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> is {{the most}} widely used ship {{maneuvering}} equipment. It consists of the maneuvering device, transmission mechanism, <b>steering</b> <b>gear,</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism and the rudder blade. MV "TANSUO HAO " is a scientific research ship of 30 years old. The scientific exploration missions require a very high accuracy of the ship’s course, so the ship has to constantly adjust her course and steer frequently. On that day, the duty officer found the <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> failure to turn left in the rough sea condition. The engineering crew members had to make an emergency repair. It took plenty of time to locate the trouble of the <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> in the repair process, because the valve plate deformation problem on the solenoid reversing valve was very hard to find out. By exploring the obscure <b>steering</b> <b>gear</b> failure reason and special troubleshooting process on MV "TANSUO HAO", this thesis provides some repair experience for the hydraulic system management and proposes flexible and patient failure analysis as well as some preventive maintenance measures against the problem.
