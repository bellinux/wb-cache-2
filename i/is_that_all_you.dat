6000|$|... "Presume to think! <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> {{know about}} young women? Pop the {{question}} right out, {{and give her}} a buss. That's the way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> have to say? Isn't {{it rather}} sad? Isn't it sudden? Come, Mr. Ferris, do {{be a little}} complimentary, for once!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One has to sometimes, you know. But <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> {{wanted to}} tell me?" [...] added Rose, anxious to turn the {{conversation}} from herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't it {{a charming}} thing?" [...] Sir Claude asked. [...] "It has just arrived, {{enclosed}} {{in a word}} of her own. She sends it on to me with the remark that comment's superfluous. I really think it <b>is.</b> <b>That's</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> can say." ...|$|R
6000|$|I.--I <b>am</b> {{thinking}} <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> {{have told}} me is more specious than [...] solid. But <b>that</b> <b>is</b> no matter. You taught, you say, accompaniment [...] and composition.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{can tell}} me? Come, Harry, <b>be</b> braver than <b>that.</b> I <b>was</b> {{not such a}} coward once with you. Are you engaged to marry her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Behaving very well? <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> {{have to tell}} me? I don't {{believe you}} said a proper word to her. You are conspiring {{together}} to kill me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Unfortunate!" [...] The Duke's manner {{changed from}} silk to steel. He heaved {{himself out of}} his chair, and his dark eyes flamed. [...] "Unfortunate! <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all,</b> <b>you</b> dog?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> {{can say for}} him?" [...] cried Marianne, indignantly. [...] "But {{what are}} his manners on more {{intimate}} acquaintance? What his pursuits, his talents, and genius?" ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{impossible}} (at least I {{have found it}} impossible) to fix on the real amount of the pretended debts with which your ministers have thought proper to load the Carnatic. They are obscure; they shun inquiry; they <b>are</b> enormous. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> know of them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It <b>is</b> {{something}} <b>that</b> moistens {{my throat}} so deliciously,' answered the jackal, 'that after I have eaten it I don't feel thirsty any more, while I <b>am</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> other beasts <b>are</b> for ever wanting water.' ...|$|R
60|$|FREDA. You'll {{be glad to}} <b>be</b> free. <b>That</b> fortnight's <b>all</b> <b>you</b> {{really loved}} me in.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't mention it," [...] {{answered}} the other, puffing his pipe slowly {{and watching the}} smoke curl into the moonlight. [...] "Such things are easy to me. <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> want?" ...|$|E
6000|$|To {{all this}} I listened with the {{greatest}} intentness. [...] "And <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> know of him?" [...] said I. [...] "And can you not tell whether he is yet on the island?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is two o'clock. <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> came for? Did {{you imagine}} I could retire to sleep without first knowing what your motive was in {{returning}} to this house? Have you then forgotten everything?" ...|$|E
60|$|Ant. If <b>that</b> <b>be</b> <b>all,</b> <b>you</b> {{shall have}} carte blanche immediately; for I {{long to be}} ratifying.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all.</b> While <b>you</b> {{diligently}} pursued that favorite phantom of yours, called profits, and moralized {{about that}} favorite fetich of yours, called competition, even greater and more direful {{things have been}} accomplished by combination. There is the militia." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My poor Maud," [...] said Mrs. Dyott {{as if in}} {{compassion}} for sophistry so simple, [...] "adventures <b>are</b> just adventures. <b>That's</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> can make of them!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>YOU</b> {{can do for}} me? I {{expected}} {{more from}} you, Mrs. Osmond," [...] said {{the young man in}} a tone of fine general reference. [...] "You know our acquaintance goes back very far--quite into the days of our innocent childhood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Like you," [...] {{repeated}} Razumov, {{glaring at}} her face, as devoid of all comeliness of feature and complexion {{as the most}} miserable beggar is of money. He smiled, still feeling chilly: a peculiar sensation which annoyed him. [...] "Disillusioned as to Peter Ivanovitch! <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> have lost?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A {{nice young}} woman! <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> {{can say for}} her? I call her a very fine girl.' Miss Golightly's friends could not say {{anything}} more, even for that young lady. 'I don't know where you'll pick up a handsomer, or a better-conducted one either, for the matter of that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It simply can't <b>be,</b> <b>that's</b> <b>all....</b> Did <b>you</b> curl me up? I'm {{nice and}} dry all over now. It {{was very good}} of you. You've been a most commendable person.... But I think we'll take a train {{for the rest of}} our pilgrimage. It hasn't been entirely successful, I'm afraid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will wait}} until it is nearly noon, when the giant will put his pot on the fire to boil his dinner. We can tell the right time by {{watching}} the smoke {{come out of his}} chimney. Then you must march straight up to the castle and into the kitchen where the giant is at work, and throw me quickly into the boiling kettle. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will <b>be</b> required to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ha! Prrumph!' he observed, disapprovingly. 'Er--Mr Bentley, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all.</b> <b>You</b> {{may return}} to your work--ah'mmm! Kindly be more careful another time in {{stamping}} the letters.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> have to say?" [...] asked Caleb Walton, after a {{few seconds}} of silence, during which he gazed so sharply at Jim Haskett that the fellow felt {{compelled}} to drop his eyes. [...] "Because a fellow dreams about a gold piece, must you accuse him of stealing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think he}} was near Cedarville at the time. He {{spends most of his}} time around Boston. <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> want to know? If it is, I'm going to lie down and try to get some sleep," [...] went on Reff Ritter, passing his hand over his forehead.|$|E
5000|$|... "Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)" [...] by Billy Joel {{includes}} the lines [...] "Who needs a house out in Hackensack? <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> get for your money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, come, my dear child! <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> nonsense. <b>You</b> must {{be kind to}} {{the poor}} fellow. Perhaps he {{will be at the}} Academy." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{content of}} {{knowledge}} and belief are given by epistemically and doxastically accessible worlds, respectively—that <b>is,</b> worlds <b>that,</b> for <b>all</b> <b>you</b> know/believe, <b>are</b> the world you live in.|$|R
6000|$|Meenie laughed again. [...] "If <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> have {{to burden}} your {{conscience}} with," [...] she said, [...] "I don't {{think you need}} spend many sleepless nights." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Is</b> <b>That</b> <b>All</b> <b>You</b> Wanted is Sherry Rich's third EP, {{released}} in 1997. The title track is lifted from her 1997 studio album Sherry Rich & Courtesy Move ...|$|E
5000|$|Ali also {{continued}} to attack his opponent verbally—most noticeably in the 3rd round {{when he was}} performing well and had plenty of energy. Referee Carlos Padilla said [...] "During the fight Ali would say 'Ah one ah two and a three ... Jack be nimble and Jack be quick, Jack jump over the candlestick. <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> can give? Come on, you ugly gorilla—hit me!'" [...] Several times, Ali made circular hand gestures at Frazier to encourage him closer.|$|E
50|$|Laynie {{has a very}} {{distinct}} writing {{style that}} is influenced by flora and fauna and being in the present. Her work brings into it the past by linking it to the present. When she was speaking she told us that she doesn’t view time traditionally - for her, time isn’t linear but kind of jumps all over the place. The one thing that firmly stands however, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> have is the present because the past is done {{and you may not}} live to see the future.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is far {{too much}} frightened and overcome. She says you may go to her father, and I think <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> can expect her to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She pleases <b>all</b> <b>you</b> wish. Never mind,' said Arthur, fairly {{putting her}} out, then {{stepping}} back, 'Lie still, and mind your big baby; <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> have to do.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So <b>you</b> think <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> {{have to ask}} pardon for,' said Mr. Edmonstone. 'I {{advise you}} to study your apologies, for you are in pretty {{tolerable}} disgrace.' ...|$|R
