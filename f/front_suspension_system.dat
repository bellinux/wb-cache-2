500|$|Vickers-Armstrong {{submitted}} the Mk VIII design to the War Office in September 1941, {{and in that}} same month the Tank Board of the War Office ordered 1,000 tanks, increased in November to 2,410. The Board hoped that production could commence in June 1942 {{at a rate of}} approximately 100 per month, to be produced by Metro-Cammell, a subsidiary of Vickers-Armstrong. It was also at this time that the tank was given the specification number A25 and given the name of Harry Hopkins [...] Production began in June 1942 as expected, but immediately began to experience problems; these are not specified, but it appears that testing of the prototypes of the Mk VIII provided by Vickers-Armstrong raised a number of issues. A minute sent to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, in September from the Ministry of Supply stated that there would be delays in delivery of the tank due to developmental problems, and a report issued by the War Office in December stated that a number of modifications would be required before production could be continued; the <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> was singled out as requiring extensive modification. Problems were still being encountered in July 1943, with a report from the Fighting Vehicle Proving Establishment indicating that serious defects were still being found in the models being tested; the problems became so acute that trials of the Mk VIII were abandoned earlier than scheduled. By 31 August 1943 only six Mk VIII tanks had been produced, compared to a War Office requirement of 100 {{by the beginning of the}} year. Although the War Office persisted in retaining the design and issued an official requirement in November 1943 for 750 tanks to be built, only around 100 had been built when production officially ended in February 1945.|$|E
2500|$|The {{air-cooled}} Villiers 10D [...] engine had a {{unit construction}} three-speed manual gearbox without reverse. This had an output of [...] at 4,400rpm which the manufacturers claimed gave a power-to-weight ratio of [...] per ton unladen. The engine unit sat in an alloy cradle {{ahead of the}} front wheel, together forming part of its support. Both front wheel and engine were sprung {{as part of the}} trailing link <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system,</b> which was fitted with a single coil spring and an Andre Hartford friction damper. The rear wheels were rigidly mounted to the body on stub axles with suspension provided by low pressure [...] "balloon" [...] type tyres. Starting was achieved by using a pull handle mounted under the dash panel and connected by cable to a modified kick-start lever on the engine. The steering comprised a system of pulleys and a cable usually referred to as [...] "bobbin and cable", connecting a conventional steering wheel to the front steering unit. The bobbin and cable steering arrangement was replaced by a rack and pinion system in October 1950. Brakes were provided on only the rear wheels; they were conventional drum brakes operated by a system of cables and rods.|$|E

40|$|YesAn {{experimental}} study of wheel movement arising from compliance in the <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> and steering <b>system</b> of a passenger car during braking is presented. Using a Kinematic and Compliance (K&C) test rig, movement of the front wheels and the suspension sub-frame, together with corresponding changes in suspension / steering geometry under simulated braking conditions, were measured and compared with dynamic measurements of the centre points of the front wheels. The resulting knowledge of front wheel deflections has enabled the causes and effects of steering drift during braking to be better understood {{in the design of}} <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> for vehicle stability...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, VehicleSim multi-body {{software}} {{is used to}} extend and modify an existing motorcycle model by including different non-conventional <b>suspension</b> <b>systems.</b> Girder and Hossack double wishbones <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> are designed, implemented and tested. Using a synthesis of mechanism methodology, they are designed with different kinematic configurations that allow different behaviours of the motorcycle front end. By means of CAD tools and finite element analysis, realistic three dimensional models of the <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> designs are developed. The dynamical properties of the mechanical assemblies are obtained from the CAD models and used to build a realistic mathematical model of a sport motorcycle fitted with theses alternative <b>suspension</b> <b>systems.</b> Dynamical and stability analyses of the alternative <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> are performed. For the different kinematic configurations, anti-dive properties and variation of the motorcycle's handling geometric parameters are studied by non-linear dynamical simulations. Stability analyses are performed {{by means of the}} motorcycle linear models eigenvalues. Passive interconnection of <b>front</b> and rear <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> of a sport motorcycle is also investigated. The effects of an interconnected <b>suspensions</b> <b>system</b> on the motorcycle in-plane motions are studied by means of reduced order linear models. The baseline model is modified to include passive interconnection forces between the <b>front</b> and rear <b>suspension</b> <b>systems.</b> The possible improvement introduced by an interconnected <b>suspensions</b> <b>system</b> in terms of suspension accuracy is investigated through non-linear simulations with delayed step tyres inputs. Appropriate values of the interconnection passive components for different possible mechanical implementation are found by means of optimization processes. Linear stability analyses are performed for each of the different optimal interconnected configurations. Nonlinear frequency analyses of the motorcycle wheels and chassis responses are also performed considering the delay between the front and rear tyre inputs. Non-linear simulations with variable frequency sinusoidal road inputs are run for this purpose. Finally, modal analyses of the motorcycle model are carried out for variable interconnection parameters {{in order to understand the}} effect of the interconnected <b>suspensions</b> <b>system</b> on the motorcycle's motion...|$|R

25|$|All {{cars are}} {{required}} to use a double wishbone setup for the <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> and independent rear <b>suspension.</b> Both the <b>front</b> and rear <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> feature adjustable shock absorbers and an anti-roll bar which can be adjusted from the cockpit.|$|R
50|$|Mechanically, the car {{utilised}} {{the hydraulic}} brake control, gear box, clutch and <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> first {{seen on the}} BMW 326, along with the live axle used on the BMW 320 and BMW 328. The BMW M78 straight-6 engine was used. The advertised top speed was 125 km/h.|$|E
50|$|The EJ12 {{incorporates}} heavy design {{revisions to}} the front of the chassis, therefore requiring a re-packaged <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system.</b> New materials and production techniques have been utilised in the chassis to further reduce weight and the centre of gravity position, with the revised side-pods making the side impact structures smaller, but more efficient.|$|E
50|$|Prototypes of {{this class}} have rear wheel drive, Volkswagen-based 2-wheel drive, and most feature a 4130 chrome tube-frame chassis {{covered by a}} fiberglass, {{aluminum}} or other composite body.

50|$|NASTRAN {{software}} application was written to help design more efficient space vehicles {{such as the}} Space Shuttle. NASTRAN was {{released to the public}} in 1971 by NASA’s Office of Technology Utilization. The commercial use of NASTRAN has helped to analyze the behavior of elastic structures of any size, shape, or purpose. For example, the automotive industry uses the program to design <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> and steering linkages. It is also used in designing railroad tracks and cars, bridges, power plants, skyscrapers, and aircraft. The program alone was estimated to have returned $701 million in cost savings from 1971 to 1984. NASTRAN was inducted into the U.S. Space Foundation’s Space Technology Hall of Fame in 1988, one of the first technologies to receive this prestigious honor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{model was}} revised in 2006, {{with changes in}} {{interior}} trim, specification levels and most notably, a new front nose. A new <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> borrowed from the Mégane 2.0 [...] was adopted, improving the driving performance. Also, the Nissan Sentra B16 {{is based on the}} 2006 platform of the Renault Megane.|$|E
50|$|Following {{his move}} to California in 2001, Norman applied his {{inventiveness}} and engineering skills developing devices {{for the medical}} field, specializing in IVUS (Intra Vascular Ultra Sound) and is named on several patents in this field. During this time he also designed a mountain bike suspension system and applied his <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> to a Ducati SS 800.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{advantage}} {{was that}} Imperial, and all Mopars, received [...] "Torsion-Aire" [...] suspension for 1957. Torsion-Aire was an indirect-acting, torsion-bar <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> which reduced unsprung weight and shifted the car's {{center of gravity}} downward and rearward. Torsion-bar suspension on the front combined with multi-leaf springs on the rear provided a smoother ride and improved handling. Pillarless hardtops, in both two and four door configurations, got the Southampton designation.|$|E
40|$|YesThis paper {{reports on}} an {{experimental}} investigation into braking-related steering drift in motor vehicles, and follows on {{from a previous}} paper by the authors {{in which it was}} concluded that braking can cause changes in wheel alignment that in turn affect the toe-steer characteristics of each wheel and therefore the straight-line stability of the vehicle during braking. Changes in suspension geometry during braking, their magnitude and the relationships between the braking forces and the suspension geometry and compliance are further investigated in an experimental study of wheel movement arising from compliance in the <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> and the steering system of a passenger car during braking. Using a kinematic and compliance (K&C) test rig, movement of the front wheels and the suspension subframe, together with corresponding changes in suspension and steering geometry under simulated braking conditions, have been measured and compared with dynamic measurements of the centre points of the front wheels. The results have enabled the causes and effects of steering drift during braking to be better understood in the design of <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> for vehicle stability during braking...|$|R

According to the simulation results, the handling stability of amphibious vehicle is evaluated objectively...|$|R
25|$|Like its predecessor, the Testarossa used double {{wishbone}} <b>front</b> and rear <b>suspension</b> <b>systems.</b> Ferrari improved traction by adding 10-inch-wide alloy rear wheels. The Testarossa drivetrain {{was also an}} evolution of the BB 512i. Its engine used near identical displacement and compression ratio, but unlike the BB 512i had four-valve cylinder heads that were finished in red.|$|R
50|$|This is {{the most}} common, widely used <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> in cars today. It is a very simple and {{effective}} design that uses a strut-type spring and shock absorber that {{work as a team}} that will pivot on a ball joint on the single lower arm. This system was popularized in British Fords in the 1950's, then adopted by BMW (1962) and Porsche (1963). Later the space-efficient system became widespread with the growing popularity of front wheel drive.|$|E
5000|$|The Type 53 {{used the}} (...) engine from the Type 50 road car fitted to the chassis of the Type 51 racer. It was {{originally}} conceived by Giulio Cappa, who created a {{front wheel drive}} Grand Prix car in 1926.

The engine output was approximately [...] As a result of the elaborate front drivetrain, the Type 53 used the only independent <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> ever approved for use by Ettore Bugatti.|$|E
50|$|H.F.S. Morgan's 1909 Runabout used sliding pillar suspension, an {{independent}} <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> with each front wheel {{mounted on a}} stub axle able to slide {{up and down a}} fixed pillar that also acts as the kingpin and supported by a spring and external shock absorber (damper). One advantage is reduced unsprung weight, theoretically allowing the tire and wheel to better respond to road surface irregularities. The Morgan system is described as an 'inverted' sliding pillar, as the pillar is fixed and the hub carrier slides over it. Earlier systems had the wheel carried on the pillar, sliding through a bush on the axle.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{recumbent}} {{bikes are}} increasingly being fitted with <b>front</b> and rear <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> for increased comfort and traction on rough surfaces. Coil, elastomer, and air-sprung <b>suspension</b> <b>systems</b> have all been used on recumbent bikes, with oil or air-damping in the forks and rear shock absorbers. The maturation of fully suspended conventional mountain bikes has aided {{the development of these}} designs, which often use many of the same parts, suitably modified for recumbent use.|$|R
50|$|The {{performance}} of the record car convinced Fend to design a sports car based on the Kabinenroller platform. The FMR Tg500 was introduced in 1958, two years after Fahrzeug- und Maschinenbau Gmbh, Regensburg (FMR) took over production of the Kabinenroller from Messerschmitt. The Tg500 used the Kabinenroller's unit body, <b>front</b> bodywork, <b>front</b> <b>suspension,</b> and steering <b>system,</b> but the rear subframe and bodywork were completely different.|$|R
40|$|A <b>front</b> axle <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> for {{a vehicle}} chassis {{includes}} {{first and second}} links pivotally connected to the chassis and extending downwardly therefrom, the second link being positioned rearwardly of the first link. A coupler link is pivotally connected to the lower ends {{of the first and}} second links and extends forwardly from them. The front axle is connected to the coupler link and is adapted to carry a front wheel for rotation about a generally horizontal centerline. A spring and dampener mechanism interconnects the coupler link and chassis to yieldably resist movement of the axle relative to the chassis. The pivotal connections of the first, second and coupler links are so arranged that the instantaneous center of the <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> will always be below and rearwardly of the front wheel centerline...|$|R
50|$|After leaving McLaren Norman {{started on}} {{motorcycle}} design, applying his accumulated {{knowledge to the}} design of his first machine, developing a unique <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> which he formulated using a wire coat hanger and a piece of wood. Wheels and parts were sourced from a scrap yard to build a rudimentary test-bed, and finally an XL500 Honda engine was donated by a friend. Although built only to test the theory, this very bike proved successful enough to graduate to the race track. Updated with Astralite wheels, it later {{went on to win the}} British Single Cylinder Championship in 1986, '87 & '88 in the hands of Vernon Glashier, who still owns the bike today.|$|E
50|$|One unique {{feature of}} the Rover 2000 was {{the design of the}} <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system,</b> in which a bell crank (an L-shaped {{rotating}} bracket trailing the upper hub carrier joint) conveyed the vertical motion of the wheel to a fore-and-aft-horizontally mounted spring fastened to the rear wall of the engine compartment. A single hydraulically damped arm was mounted on the firewall for the steering.The front suspension was designed to allow as much width for the engine compartment as possible so that Rover's Gas Turbine engine could be fitted. In the event, the engine was never used for the production vehicle, but the engine compartment width facilitated the accommodation of the V8 engine adopted years after the P6's initial launch.|$|E
5000|$|Tasked with {{designing}} {{rolling chassis}} for two cars while using {{as much as}} possible from the existing 502 sedan, engineer Fritz Fiedler designed two versions of a new ladder frame, one with the same wheelbase as the 502, and one with a shortened wheelbase. The long-wheelbase version was used in the 503. Both cars used the steering system and a variant of the <b>front</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> from the 502; the 503 also used the 502's rear suspension. As originally designed, the 503 used the 502's remote gearbox placement and shift linkage. [...] Both cars used the braking system developed for the 3.2 sedan, using drum brakes with vacuum assist. [...] All 503s were configured for left hand drive.|$|E
50|$|For {{this new}} {{category}} single-seater was developed a chassis designed specifically built to Bandini with elements mixed-section round and elliptical.The rear suspension saw {{for the first}} time on a Bandini, the application of De Dion system with the adoption in some cases even a Watt system. On the <b>front</b> however, the <b>suspension</b> <b>system</b> is triangles overlapping with the ability to adjust quickly camber. The steering adopt a solution anti-Ackermann.|$|R
50|$|This {{proved to}} be a very popular vehicle and in 1985 Honda made major {{upgrades}} to the Odyssey and released the FL350. Changes were an improved roll cage, 350 cc engine with electric starter, and a full <b>front</b> and back <b>suspension</b> <b>system.</b> Then in late 1989 Honda released the FL 400. In addition to the increased engine size (a liquid cooled 400 cc unit) it had its suspension improved to handle the extra load. However this had evolved into an expensive vehicle and sales were disappointing so Honda ceased manufacture in 1990.|$|R
