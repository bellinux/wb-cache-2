In the Cosmos chapter [...] "Blues For a Red Planet", Sagan wrote, [...] "If {{there is life}} on Mars, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> do nothing with Mars.

6000|$|BEFORE {{another word}} had been {{exchanged}} between us, Lucilla entered the room. We {{looked at each}} other. If we could have spoken at that moment, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> both have said, [...] "Thank God, she is blind!" ...|$|E
5000|$|You {{are talking}} to a leftist. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> in the {{redistribution}} of wealth and power in the world. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> in universal hospital care for everyone. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not have a single homeless person in the richest country in the world.

60|$|Do you know, we {{came very}} near sending {{for you this}} winter. If we had not had news that you were ill too, <b>I</b> almost <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have done so, we were so much in trouble.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be {{thinking}} in terms of developing for this country a unified comprehensive system of contributory social insurance which would cover all of the major economic hazards to which the workers of this country are subjected, namely, old age, disability, death, and unemployment.|$|R

"Far from it; {{but when}} claims were disputed, {{is it not}} natural for the loser to view them as a hardship? <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have had a much better neighbourhood, as you call it, with France, had not the modern {{difficulties}} connected with religious changes, occurred." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{he arrived}} within six {{miles of the}} town, the Jews poured out; and fell upon them with such fury that, if the horse and light troops had not made a circuit, and fallen upon us in the rear, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have {{destroyed}} the whole army. But {{we were forced to}} fall back, having killed over five hundred. As the Romans moved forward, Simon--son of Gioras--with a band, pressed them closely in rear; and slew many, and carried off numbers of their beasts of burden.|$|E
60|$|Such is the {{diversity}} of opinion upon the why and the wherefore of education. And my hearers will be prepared to expect that the practical recommendations which are put forward are not less discordant. There is a loud cry for compulsory education. We English, in spite of constant experience to the contrary, preserve a touching faith in the efficacy of acts of Parliament; and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have compulsory education {{in the course of}} next session, if there were the least probability that half a dozen leading statesmen of different parties would agree what that education should be.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have formed}} a {{different}} idea of their strength," [...] he answered.

40|$|It {{seems to}} me a paradox that clinicians ask {{patients}} about their past medical history and remain indifferent to the subject of medical history. In history taking we value the past information and try to use this in understanding the presenting problem. This sometimes results in diagnosis and subsequently considered action. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> consider medical history in the same light...|$|R
60|$|This storm {{drove us}} {{away to the}} northward; and I once thought {{we should have been}} driven back to the Cape again; which, if it had happened, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never have gone on with the voyage; for the men began to murmur again, and say we were bewitched; that we were beaten off first from the south of America, that we could never get round there, and now driven back from the south of Africa; so that, in short, it looked as if fate had {{determined}} this voyage to be pursued no farther. The wind continued, and blew exceeding hard: and, in short, we were driven so far to the north, that we made the south point of the island of Madagascar.|$|E
60|$|Same day, 11 o'clock P.M.--Oh, but I am tired! If it {{were not}} that I had made my diary a duty I should not open it tonight. We had a lovely walk. Lucy, after a while, was in gay spirits, owing, I think, to some dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse, and frightened the wits out of us. I believe we forgot everything, except of course, {{personal}} fear, {{and it seemed to}} wipe the slate clean and give us a fresh start. We had a capital 'severe tea' at Robin Hood's Bay in a sweet little old-fashioned inn, with a bow window right over the seaweed-covered rocks of the strand. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have shocked the 'New Woman' with our appetites. Men are more tolerant, bless them! Then we walked home with some, or rather many, stoppages to rest, and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls.|$|E
60|$|We then {{removed to}} Pisa, {{and took up}} our abode there for the winter. The extreme {{mildness}} of the climate suited Shelley, and his solitude was enlivened by an intercourse with several intimate friends. Chance cast us strangely enough on this quiet half-unpeopled town; but its very peace suited Shelley. Its river, the near mountains, and not distant sea, added to its attractions, and were the objects of many delightful excursions. We feared the south of Italy, and a hotter climate, on account of our child; our former bereavement inspiring us with terror. We seemed to take root here, and moved little afterwards; often, indeed, entertaining projects for visiting other parts of Italy, but still delaying. But for our fears on account of our child, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have wandered over the world, both being passionately fond of travelling. But human life, besides its great unalterable necessities, is ruled by a thousand lilliputian ties that shackle at the time, although {{it is difficult to}} account afterwards for their influence over our destiny.|$|E
60|$|Then I begged I {{might have}} my clothes on shore with me. He {{told me he}} was afraid I should have little need of clothes, for he did not see how we could long subsist on the island, and that he had been told that the {{inhabitants}} were cannibals or men-eaters (though he had no reason for that suggestion), and <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not be able to live among them. I told him I was not so afraid of that as I was of starving for want of victuals; and as for the inhabitants being cannibals, <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be more likely to eat them than they us, if we could but get at them. But I was mightily concerned, I said, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have no weapons with us to defend ourselves, and I begged nothing now, but that he would give me a gun and a sword, with a little powder and shot.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not I; {{the poor}} rogues were not worth wasting good powder on, {{and a good}} English drubbing was a much newer and more {{effective}} experiment. I was thenceforth known {{by the name of}} Grandfather of Clubs, and Brown always manoeuvred me into sleeping across the entrance of the tent. <b>I</b> do <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have left him entombed in the desert sands, if John's dressing-case had been lost!' ...|$|R
5000|$|Bush {{supports}} {{legislation to}} ban abortion after 20 weeks, making exceptions {{for the life}} of the mother, rape, or incest. In August 2015, Bush said: [...] "My record as a pro-life governor is not in dispute. I am completely pro-life and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have a culture of life." [...] In 2003, Bush described himself as [...] "probably the most pro-life governor in modern times." ...|$|R
6000|$|Those who regard Hannah More as a prim maiden {{lady of the}} {{conventional}} type, with a pious and literary turn of mind, will be obliged to change their views should they read Mrs. Walford's admirable sketch of the authoress of Percy. Hannah More was a brilliant wit, a femme d'esprit, passionately fond of society, and loved by society in return. When the serious-minded little country girl, who {{at the age of}} eight had covered a whole quire of paper with letters seeking to reform imaginary depraved characters, and with return epistles full of contrition and promises of amendment, paid her first visit to London, she became at once the intimate friend of Johnson, Burke, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Garrick, and most of the distinguished people of the day, delighting them by her charm, and grace, and wit. 'I dined at the Adelphi yesterday,' she writes in one of her letters. 'Garrick was the very soul of the company, and I never saw Johnson in more perfect good-humour. After all had risen to go we stood round them for above an hour, laughing, in defiance of every rule of decorum and Chesterfield. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never have thought of sitting down, nor of parting, had not an impertinent watchman been saucily vociferating. Johnson outstaid them all, and sat with me for half an hour.' The following is from her sister's pen: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Sir Elijah,--I {{have the}} {{satisfaction}} {{to inform you}} that we [...] have at length so far obtained the great object of our expedition [...] to this place as to commence on the receipt of money, of which, in [...] the course of this day, we have got about six lacs. I know not yet [...] what amount we shall actually realize, but I think I may safely [...] venture to pronounce it will be equal to the liquidation of the [...] Company's balance. It has been at once the most important and the [...] most difficult point of duty which has ever occurred in my office; [...] and the anxiety, the hopes and fears, which have alternately [...] agitated my mind, cannot be described or conceived but by those who [...] have been witness to what has passed {{in the course of this}} long [...] contest. The [Nabob's] ministers have supported me nobly, and [...] deserve much commendation. Without the shrewd discernment and [...] knowledge of the finesse and tricks of the country which Hyder Beg [...] Khân possesses, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have succeeded but [...] indifferently; for I soon found that no real advantage was to be [...] obtained by proceeding at once to violent extremities with the [...] Begum, and that she was only to be attacked through the medium of [...] her confidential servants, who it required considerable address to [...] get hold of. However, we at last effected it; and by using some few [...] severities with them, we at length came at the secret hoards of [...] this old lady. I will write you more particulars hereafter.|$|E
6000|$|That, however, is not {{the main}} point to which I desire just now to direct attention. I want rather to suggest an {{underlying}} fallacy of all so-called individualists in dealing with schemes of so-called Socialism--for to me your Socialist is the true and only individualist. My correspondent's argument is written {{from the standpoint of}} the class in which women have or may have money. But most women have none; and schemes of reconstruction must be for the benefit of the many. So-called individualists seem to think that under a more organised social state they would not be so able to buy pictures as at present, not so free to run across to California or Kamschatka. I doubt their premiss, for <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> all of us be better off than we are to-day; but let that pass; 'tis a detail. The main thing is this: they forget that most of us are narrowly tied and circumscribed at present by endless monopolies and endless restrictions of land or capital. I should like to buy pictures; but I can't afford them. I long to see Japan; but I shall never get there. The man in the street may desire to till the ground: every acre is appropriated. He may wish to dig coal: Lord Masham prevents him. He may have a pretty taste in Venetian glass: the flints on the shore are private property; the furnace and the implements belong to a capitalist. Under the existing régime, the vast mass of us are hampered at every step in order that a few may enjoy huge monopolies. Most men have no land, so that one man may own a county. And they call this Individualism! ...|$|E

We have had good lodgings, and the beasts have fared well on hay, but {{had it not been}} for the food we brought from the last halting-place, verily <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> not have had a bite from the time we entered the place five days ago to now." ...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{some believe}} it was a replica of Copenhagen's The Little Mermaid, the creator stated: <b>I</b> didn't <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have a copy of the mermaid. She is {{rightfully}} a symbol of Copenhagen... I proposed to have a life-size scuba diver seated there. At that time scuba diving was getting quite popular here in Vancouver and, just as important, I didn't know of any similar sculpture anywhere in the world. It was a new idea… There was tremendous opposition and great controversy. I still don't know why.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2009, King {{commented on}} reports that accused {{attempted}} airline bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, had admitted to being trained and equipped in Yemen and on then pending plans to release several Guantanamo prisoners to Yemen: [...] "I don't think Guantanamo should be closed, but if we're {{going to close}} it <b>I</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be sending people to Yemen where prisoners have managed to escape in the past .... Obviously, if Abdulmutallab did get training and direction from Yemen, it just adds to what is already a dangerous situation", he said.|$|R
60|$|In {{the same}} manner, though we cannot {{possibly}} expect to exclude riches and poverty from society, yet {{if we could}} find out a mode of government by which the numbers in the extreme regions would be lessened and the numbers in the middle regions increased, it would be undoubtedly our duty to adopt it. It is not, however, improbable that as in the oak, the roots and branches could not be diminished very greatly without weakening the vigorous circulation of the sap in the stem, so in society the extreme parts could not be diminished beyond a certain degree without lessening that animated exertion throughout the middle parts, which is the very cause {{that they are the}} most favourable to the growth of intellect. If no man could hope to rise or fear to fall, in society, if industry did not bring with it its reward and idleness its punishment, the middle parts would not certainly be what they now are. In reasoning upon this subject, it is evident that we ought to consider chiefly the mass of mankind and not individual instances. There are undoubtedly many minds, and there ought to be many, according to the chances out of so great a mass, that, having been vivified early by a peculiar course of excitements, would not need the constant action of narrow motives to continue them in activity. But if we were to review the various useful discoveries, the valuable writings, and other laudable exertions of mankind, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> find that more were to be attributed to the narrow motives that operate upon the many than to the apparently more enlarged motives that operate upon the few.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{sense in}} that," [...] said Lapham. He took his cigar {{out of his}} mouth, and pulled his chair a little toward the table, on which he placed his {{ponderous}} fore-arms. [...] "I {{want to tell you}} about a fellow I had in my own company when we first went out. We were all privates to begin with; after a while they elected me captain--I'd had the tavern stand, and most of 'em knew me. But Jim Millon never got to be anything more than corporal; corporal when he was killed." [...] The others arrested themselves in various attitudes of attention, and remained listening to Lapham with an interest that profoundly flattered him. Now, at last, he felt that he was holding up his end of the rope. [...] "I can't say he went into the thing from the highest motives, altogether; our motives are always pretty badly mixed, and when there's such a hurrah-boys as there was then, you can't tell which is which. I suppose Jim Millon's wife was enough to account for his going, herself. She was a pretty bad assortment," [...] said Lapham, lowering his voice and glancing round at the door to make sure that it was shut, [...] "and she used to lead Jim ONE kind of life. Well, sir," [...] continued Lapham, synthetising his auditors in that form of address, [...] "that fellow used to save every cent of his pay and send it to that woman. Used to get me to do it for him. I tried to stop him. 'Why, Jim,' said I, 'you know what she'll do with it.' 'That's so, Cap,' says he, 'but I don't know what she'll do without it.' And it did keep her straight--straight as a string--as long as Jim lasted. Seemed as if there was something mysterious about it. They had a little girl,--about as old as my oldest girl,--and Jim used to talk to me about her. Guess he done it as much for her as for the mother; and he said to me before the last action we went into, 'I should like to turn tail and run, Cap. I ain't comin' out o' this one. But I don't suppose it would do.' 'Well, not for you, Jim,' said I. 'I want to live,' he says; and he bust out crying right there in my tent. 'I want to live for poor Molly and Zerrilla'--that's what they called the little one; I dunno where they got the name. 'I ain't ever had half a chance; and now she's doing better, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> get along after this.' He set there cryin' like a baby. But he wa'n't no baby when he went into action. I hated to look at him after it was over, not so much because he'd got a ball that was meant for me by a sharpshooter--he saw the devil takin' aim, and he jumped to warn me--as because he didn't look like Jim; he looked like--fun; all desperate and savage. I guess he died hard." ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{impossible}} for me to tell her the whole truth without, at the same time, entering into particulars {{on the subject of the}} conspiracy, which it would have been dangerous to confide to a stranger. I could only abstain most carefully from raising any false hopes, and then explain that the object of my visit was to discover the persons who were really responsible for Anne's disappearance. I even added, so as to exonerate myself from any after-reproach of my own conscience, that I entertained not the least hope of being able to trace her--that <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never see her alive again--and that my main interest in the affair was to bring to punishment two men whom I suspected to be concerned in luring her away, and at whose hands I and some dear friends of mine had suffered a grievous wrong. With this explanation I left it to Mrs. Clements to say whether our interest in the matter (whatever difference there might be in the motives which actuated us) was not the same, and whether she felt any reluctance to forward my object by giving me such information on the subject of my inquiries as she happened to possess.|$|R
