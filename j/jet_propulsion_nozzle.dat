40|$|A <b>jet</b> <b>propulsion</b> exhaust <b>nozzle</b> is {{reported}} for multi-engine installations which produces high internal/external, thrust-minus-drag, performance for transonic cruise or transonic acceleration {{as well as}} improved performance at subsonic and supersonic speeds. A two dimensional wedge/translating shroud provides the variable nozzle exit geometry needed to achieve high engine performance {{over a wide range}} of throttle power settings...|$|R
40|$|A first {{space vehicle}} is {{attached}} {{with a second}} space vehicle which includes a rocket <b>propulsion</b> <b>nozzle</b> having a combustion chamber upstream from the nozzle throat. Apparatus 10 includes an elongate grappling arm 12 extending from the first space vehicle, a pair of inflatable bladders 16, 18 positioned about the grappling arm for engaging an inner surface of the combustion chamber upon inflation. {{and a pair of}} rear bladders 20, 22 positioned about the grappling arm for engaging an inner surface of the nozzle downstream from the combustion chamber upon inflation for aligning the grappling arm and the rocket <b>propulsion</b> <b>nozzle.</b> A pressurized fluid source 24 is provided on the first space vehicle for supplying fluid pressure to the inflatable bladders. and a fluid control valve manifold 30 selectively controls the release of pressurized fluid to the bladders. According to the method of the invention. the grappling arm is inserted into the rocket <b>propulsion</b> <b>nozzle.</b> and the control valves are actuated to first inflate the front bladders and thereby interconnect the grappling arm and the rocket <b>propulsion</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The rear bladders are subsequently inflated to align a central axis of the grappling arm with a central axis of the rocket <b>propulsion</b> <b>nozzle.</b> Inflation of the rear bladders provides an axial reaction load to balance the axial load provided by the front bladders. Attaching the vehicles in space may be controlled from the earth by activating the control valves to inflate the bladders. The cost of attaching space vehicles is significantly reduced by attaching a grappling arm on one vehicle with the existing rocket <b>propulsion</b> <b>nozzle</b> of another vehicle...|$|R

25|$|While most {{cephalopods}} {{can move}} by <b>jet</b> <b>propulsion,</b> {{this is a}} very energy-consuming way to travel compared to the tail propulsion used by fish. The efficiency of a propellor-driven waterjet (i.e. Froude efficiency) is a more efficient model than rocket efficiency. The relative efficiency of <b>jet</b> <b>propulsion</b> decreases further as animal size increases; paralarvae are far more efficient than juvenile and adult individuals. Since the Paleozoic era, as competition with fish produced an environment where efficient motion was crucial to survival, <b>jet</b> <b>propulsion</b> has taken a back role, with fins and tentacles used to maintain a steady velocity.|$|R
