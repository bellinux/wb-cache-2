5|$|Following his {{discharge}} from military service, Groza {{reported to the}} Browns' training camp in Bowling Green, Ohio. <b>He</b> <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> in army fatigues carrying all his clothes in a duffel bag. There, he joined quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and receivers Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie to form {{the core of the}} new team's offense. Groza was mainly a placekicker in his first two years with the Browns, but he played a big part in the team's early success. In his first season, he set a professional football record for both field goals and extra points. The Browns, meanwhile, advanced to the AAFC championship against the New York Yankees. Groza sprained his ankle in the game and missed three field goals, but Cleveland won 14–9. Behind a powerful offense led by Graham, Motley and Lavelli, the Browns finished the 1947 season with a 12–1–1 record and made it back to the championship game.

25|$|Seminoles {{were still}} {{scattered}} {{throughout most of}} Florida. One band that {{had been reduced to}} starvation surrendered in northern Florida near the Apalachicola River in 1842.

On April 19, 1842, a column of 200 soldiers led by First Lieutenant George A. McCall found a group of Seminole warriors in the Pelchikaha Swamp, about thirty miles south of Fort King.

25|$|In {{order to}} get work as an actor, Reuss began an {{elaborate}} subterfuge. He retreated to a cabin he owned up in the mountains.

After a year, <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> in the created persona of Kaspar Brandhofer, a Tyrolian peasant, having grown a full beard. To further hide his identity, he dyed all of his hair, head and body, by bathing every ten days in diluted hydrogen.

Having worked with director Max Reinhardt years before, Reuss was fearful that the director would recognize him, but Reinhardt did not. In fact, his ability so impressed the director, that Reinhardt recommended him to Ernst Lothar, in Vienna.|$|E

25|$|Lee was {{an early}} {{influence}} on physician and human rights activist H. Jack Geiger. They met in 1940 when Geiger, a 14-year-old middle-class Jewish runaway, was backstage at a Broadway production of Native Son. Lee agreed to take Geiger in when <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> at his door in Harlem asking {{for a place to}} stay. With the consent of his parents, Geiger stayed with Lee for over a year. Lee took on the role of surrogate father and introduced Geiger to Langston Hughes, Billy Strayhorn, Richard Wright, and Adam Clayton Powell. Geiger eventually became a journalist, then a doctor who co-founded the first community health center in the United States, Columbia Point Health Center in Dorchester, Massachusetts. He became a founder of Physicians for Social Responsibility and Physicians for Human Rights, and established community health centers in Mississippi and South Africa. Geiger says he would never have moved so deeply in these worlds so quickly if not for his experiences with Canada Lee.|$|E
