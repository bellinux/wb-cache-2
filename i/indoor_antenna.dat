5000|$|Soon after {{television}} broadcasting switched from analog to digital broadcasting, <b>indoor</b> <b>antennas</b> have evolved {{beyond the traditional}} [...] "rabbit ears." [...] RCA is one manufacturer which has commercially sold a flat antenna. Flat antennas are very lightweight, very thin, and square-shaped like a thin notebook. They connect to televisions, or to digital converter boxes, with a single coaxial cable, and may be sold with an optional signal amplifier. The amplifier must be plugged into a power source, but the flat antenna {{does not require a}} power source.

50|$|An <b>indoor</b> <b>antenna</b> {{may include}} an {{amplifier}} circuit, whereby powered {{reception of the}} signal can help with capturing {{as much of an}} FM, UHF/VHF signal, for amplifying a radio or television signal. Its draw backs are that any noise is usually amplified as well, and a common result from this is amplification of ghost images (for analog signals), and any other perturberances that may be existing locally or even extra terrestrially like the Cosmic microwave background radiation for devices that work in that frequency range.|$|E

40|$|A {{full-duplex}} relay {{enhances the}} end-to-end spectral efficiency {{compared to a}} half-duplex relay, provided that the loop-back interference at relays is managed well. In order to study the feasibility of the full-duplex relay, {{it is crucial to}} measure and model the loop-back interference channels. This paper presents a measurement campaign of these channels for outdoor-to-indoor communications. A compact relay antenna was developed to serve as a signal repeater between outdoor base stations and indoor users, and was used for the loop-back interference channel measurement. Measurement results revealed that the mean interference level was - 48 dB in the compact relay antenna, and it could be further reduced by placing the outdoor and <b>indoor</b> <b>antennas</b> in a different position referred to as a separate relay. Combined with an appropriate countermeasure to reduce the interference level, such as an interference canceller, the full-duplex operation of indoor compact relay terminal was found to be feasible...|$|R
5000|$|A {{television}} antenna, or TV aerial, is {{an antenna}} {{specifically designed for}} the reception of over-the-air broadcast television signals, which are transmitted at frequencies from about 41 to 250 MHz in the VHF band, and 470 to 960 MHz in the UHF band in different countries. Television antennas are manufactured in two different types: [...] "indoor" [...] antennas, to be located on top of or next to the television set, and [...] "outdoor" [...] antennas, mounted on a mast {{on top of the}} owner's house. They can also be mounted in a loft or attic, where the dry conditions and increased elevation are advantageous for reception and antenna longevity. Outdoor antennas are more expensive and difficult to install, but are necessary for adequate reception in fringe areas far from television stations. The most common types of <b>indoor</b> <b>antennas</b> are the dipole ("rabbit ears") and loop antennas, and for outdoor antennas the yagi, log periodic, and for UHF channels the multi-bay reflective array antenna.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} propose a {{solution}} for the indoor positioning question, several tests with the repealite-based (similar to Pseudolites and repeaters) system have been carried out. This system uses a single Global Navigation Satellite System signal transmitted by all the <b>indoor</b> <b>antennas.</b> These signals may interfere with the satellite ones outdoors. Hence, the noise level at the outdoor receiver will be higher and the error range larger. To avoid these effects, new codes called Indoor-Modified Binary Offset Carrier codes {{that are capable of}} reducing interference with outdoor signals are generated. To analyse the performance of these codes, we carry out a theoretical expression of cross-correlation functions. Then the deployment of the repealite based system in a typical building is simulated. The goal of this step is to compare the interference performance of the new code with the one already used (Gold codes for GPS band and maximal sequence for Glonass one). A specific interest is given to the spectral interference when adding the new signal's spectrum in the considered frequency ban...|$|R

50|$|As of the {{beginning}} of 2012, almost all Canadian broadcasters are now broadcasting an ATSC signal, with a handful of exceptions granted for low power and regional stations. These signals can be reliably tuned in most cities with a good <b>indoor</b> <b>antenna</b> and an ATSC tuner. US based ATSC signals can be reliably tuned with an outdoor antenna and an ATSC tuner in Canadian markets within 60 miles of the US broadcast towers. These markets include Toronto (from Buffalo), Windsor (from Detroit and Toledo), Vancouver (from Seattle and Tacoma), Montreal (from Burlington and Plattsburgh), Ottawa (from Watertown and Plattsburgh), Fredericton (from Presque Isle). Indoor antennas (both passive and amplified) are easier to install, but outdoor antennas are better at tuning stations from further distances.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, amateur radio {{operators}} and hobby shortwave listeners have ‘rediscovered’ this antenna, especially for broadcast receiving and for amateur two-way modes such as Morse code and PSK31 where brute force performance {{is not as}} important as a 'steady' signal. There have also been (disputed) claims that this antenna is comparatively insensitive to man-made radio interference, making it useful in urban environments, where a low noise floor is often more beneficial than high received signal strength. The T2FD is useful for hidden indoor systems, or where several optimised frequency-specific antennas cannot be accommodated. For example: an <b>indoor</b> <b>antenna</b> only 24 feet long will allow operation on all amateur HF bands above 14 MHz on transmit, and down to 7 MHz on receive.|$|E
50|$|Most of Metro Detroit {{receives}} stations from Windsor. Monroe County, Lenawee County, southern Washtenaw County, {{and most}} Downriver communities in Wayne County receive Toledo stations.

50|$|WHDH {{shut down}} its analog signal, over VHF channel 7, on June 12, 2009, the {{official}} date in which full-power television {{stations in the}} United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 42 to VHF channel 7 for post-transition operations. Because {{of a large number}} of complaints regarding the inability of viewers receiving over-the-air programming on channel 7, WHDH requested and received temporary authority from the FCC on June 16, 2009 to simulcast its programming on UHF channel 42, in addition to VHF channel 7. Although stations in other major markets have similar problems, WHDH is the only station in the Boston area market which changed its digital channel due to the June 2009 transition, requiring a channel map rescan to receive the station. WHDH was also one of three area stations, along with WMUR-TV (channel 9) and WWDP (channel 46), to broadcast in VHF post-transition, requiring either a traditional <b>indoor</b> <b>antenna</b> within Boston proper, or in outer areas at minimum an outdoor antenna.|$|E
50|$|WTVF is {{actually}} a significantly viewed station in the Bowling Green, Kentucky market, owing to WTVF's transmitter tower being located {{on the north side}} of Nashville. As a result, its signal was strong enough to be received in most of that area. For many years since its 1954 inception, WTVF had a decades-long monopoly in providing CBS programming to certain counties in south-central Kentucky as that area was not served by a CBS station within the area. This came to an end on February 1, 2007, when Bowling Green area NBC affiliate WNKY launched a new second digital subchannel to serve as the area's CBS affiliate. In spite of the existence of WNKY-DT2, WTVF remains available on several cable systems in the Bowling Green market. Mediacom cable systems currently carry the station's main channel in the Morgantown (Butler County) and Brownsville (Edmonson County) areas. Charter Communications in Bowling Green, as well as the two Glasgow-based cable systems of the South Central Rural Telephone Cooperative and the Glasgow Electric Plant Board currently carries all three of WTVF's digital subchannels. The SCRTC in Glasgow also has been piping in WLKY in Louisville as a secondary option since 1990, and its MeTV affiliated subchannel since its 2008 launch. Many areas of the Bowling Green market can still pick up WTVF via an outdoor antenna. Some users of <b>indoor</b> <b>antennas</b> in southern Kentucky, and the far reaches of the station's coverage area can also pick up the signal thanks to their digital signal upgrade in 2013.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the most}} common {{problems}} was the return to VHF frequencies by stations that had used them when they were analog. Over 480 stations were broadcasting digitally on the VHF spectrum after the transition, up from only 216 on the frequencies before. Many antennas marketed for digital TV are designed for UHF, which most digital stations use. VHF analog signals travel further than UHF signals, but watchable VHF digital signals appear to have a more limited range than UHF with the lower power they are assigned, and they don't penetrate buildings as well, especially in larger cities. Mike Doback, vice president of engineering for Scripps Television, said, [...] "It’s only now that we’ve found out the planning factors were probably wrong in terms of how much power you need to replicate analog service." [...] According to TV consultant Peter Putman, the problem with VHF reception is that VHF antennas must be large to be effective, and <b>indoor</b> <b>antennas</b> do not perform well enough. In addition, channels 2 through 6 are more susceptible to many types of interference. Richard Mertz of Cavell, Mertz & Associates says multipath interference inside the house is also a factor. Some receivers can deal with this problem better than others, but there are no standards. And with amplified antennas or amplifiers, it is possible to overload a converter box. Amplifiers can also cause noise that is interpreted as data. Raycom Media Chief Technology Officer Dave Folsom said, [...] "There’s nothing inherently wrong with VHF. It’s just easier to have interference, because it goes out further.” ...|$|R
