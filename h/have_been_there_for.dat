5|$|Before the Bankruptcy Act of 1869, debtors in England were {{routinely}} imprisoned at {{the pleasure of}} their creditors. Around 10,000people in England and Wales were in prison for debt in 1641, often for small amounts. In the 18th century debtors comprised over half the prison population: 945 of London's 1,500 prisoners in 1779 were debtors. According to John Wade, writing in 1829, in London in 1826–1827, 753 people were imprisoned for debts under ₤5, for between 20 and 100 days. In Southwark that year the debts of 1,893 prisoners amounted collectively to ₤16,442 (over ₤1 million in 2014). Other European countries had legislation limiting imprisonment for debt to one year, but debtors in England were imprisoned until their creditors were satisfied. When the Fleet Prison closed in 1842, two debtors were found to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> 30years.|$|E
5|$|Andrei and Daniil {{are working}} on the {{decoration}} of a church in Vladimir. Although they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> several months the walls are still white and bare as Andrei is doubting himself. A messenger arrives with word from the furious Bishop to say they have until the Autumn to finish the job. On a nearby road {{in the middle of a}} field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to paint a subject such as the Last Judgement as he doesn’t want to terrify people into submission. He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease of mind that an artist needs for his work. Foma, impatient and ambitious, resigns and leaves Andrei's group to take up the offer of painting a smaller, less prestigious, church. Stone carvers and decorators of Andrei's party have also been working on the Grand Prince's mansion. The Prince wants the work to be done again more in line with his tastes but the workers already have another job, at the mansion of the Grand Prince's brother, and refuse. On a path through the woods soldiers accost the artisans on the orders of the Grand Prince and gouge their eyes out, so that they cannot replicate their work. Back at the church Andrei is dismayed by the news of their fate and angrily throws paint and smears it on one of the walls. Sergei (Vladimir Titov) one of the young apprentices who escaped the attack unharmed reads a random section of the bible aloud, at Daniil's request, concerning women. Durochka (Irma Raush) (whose name identifies her as a holy fool or Yurodivy), wanders in out of the rain and is upset by the sight of the paint on the wall. Her feeble-mindedness and innocence leads Andrei to the idea to paint a feast.|$|E
25|$|Developments in {{the field}} of {{economics}} are often expressed and legitimized in Kuhnian terms. For instance, neoclassical economists have claimed “to be at the second stage , and to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> a very long time – since Adam Smith, according to some accounts (Hollander, 1987), or Jevons according to others (Hutchison, 1978).” In the 1970s, Post Keynesian economists denied the coherence of the neoclassical paradigm, claiming that their own paradigm would ultimately become dominant.|$|E

25|$|Acquisition {{of human}} remains by museums {{can happen in}} a number of ways, some of which are {{considered}} to be unethical today. Many museums have human remains in their collections which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> over a hundred years, in which case they may likely have been acquired in ethically or morally unsound ways. Most institutions and museum associations have their own policies on the acquisition of human remains.

25|$|Seven years later, Crichton {{published}} Sphere, a novel which {{relates the}} story of psychologist Norman Johnson, who is required by the U.S. Navy to join {{a team of scientists}} assembled by the U.S. Government to examine an enormous alien spacecraft discovered on the bed of the Pacific Ocean, and believed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> over 300 years. The novel begins as a science fiction story, but rapidly changes into a psychological thriller, ultimately exploring the nature of the human imagination. The novel was adapted into the film Sphere in 1998, directed by Barry Levinson, with a cast including Dustin Hoffman as Norman Johnson, (renamed Norman Goodman), Samuel L. Jackson as Harry Adams, Liev Schreiber as Ted Fielding and Sharon Stone as Beth Halpern.|$|E

During a day at the pool, he sees the tourists jump to shake off the cold when the heat is unbearable. The strangest thing he notices is the presence of two suns and two moons in the sky.|$|E
25|$|The Aral Sea fishing industry, {{which in}} its heyday {{employed}} some 40,000 and reportedly produced one-sixth of the Soviet Union's entire fish catch, has been devastated, and former fishing towns along the original shores have become ship graveyards. Aral, originally the main fishing port, is now several miles from the sea and has seen its population decline dramatically {{since the beginning of}} the crisis. The town of Moynaq in Uzbekistan had a thriving harbor and fishing industry that employed about 30,000 people; now it lies miles from the shore. Fishing boats lie scattered on the dry land that was once covered by water; many <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> 20 years.

In 1957, he goes to jail, sorrowfully questioning his misfortune and crying in despair. Upon returning to New York City in 1958, he happens upon his estranged brother Joey, who forgives him, but is elusive.
