I {{realized}} Indian cinema is about values, tradition, subtlety, romance. There is so much soul in it.

2500|$|Shindo is most {{remembered for}} the albums he {{recorded}} featuring {{a mix of}} eastern and western musical styles and instrumentation. [...] Jazz composer and critic Leonard Feather named Shindo as a [...] "Giant of Jazz" [...] in the fifteenth article in Feather's series on the [...] "giants of jazz." [...] His albums won favor with listeners of music in the exotica genre that also included artists Martin Denny, Les Baxter and Arthur Lyman. [...] The popularity of exotica peaked in 1959 as Denny's album [...] "Exotica" [...] spent five weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart and was the No. 3 {{album of the year}} according to Billboard. Shindo later recalled what attracted him to the style: [...] "Everyone is looking for a style. So in my case, I decided being Oriental, I had something I should draw upon and so <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> 'exotic sound.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1927 Bacon {{moved to}} Berlin, where he saw Fritz Lang's Metropolis and Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin, later {{catalysts}} of his artistic imagination. Bacon spent {{two months in}} Berlin, though Harcourt-Smith left after one– [...] "He soon got tired of me, of course, and went off with a woman ... I didn't {{really know what to}} do, so I hung on for a while, and then, since I'd managed to keep a bit of money, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Paris." [...] Bacon then spent the next year and a half in Paris. He met Yvonne Bocquentin, pianist and connoisseur, at the opening of an exhibition. Aware of his own need to learn French, Bacon lived for three months with Madame Bocquentin and her family at their house near Chantilly. He travelled into Paris to visit the city's art galleries. At the Château de Chantilly (Musée Condé) he saw Nicolas Poussin's Massacre of the Innocents, a painting which he often referred to in his own later work. From Chantilly, he went to an exhibition that inspired him to take up painting.|$|E
2500|$|Gorky saw Leskov {{as a true}} {{artist whose}} place [...] "beside masters like L. Tolstoy, Gogol, Turgenev and Goncharov is well-deserved". He was greatly {{intrigued}} by the way Leskov managed to secure himself total independence in the community where no such thing seemed possible ("he was neither Narodnik nor Slavophile, neither Westernizer, nor liberal or conservative") and, at the same time, developed [...] "deep insight {{into the life of}} the existing classes and social groups of Russia... something none of his greater contemporaries like Tolstoy or Turgenev, could ever do". [...] "...It was Leskov who dissected Rus thoroughly," [...] Gorky said (through his character Klim Samgin), later explaining: [...] "Leskov was... the only Russian author to have succeeded in separating the whole generation of his countrymen into a new set of sub-classes, each belonging to a different epoch." [...] Gorky mentioned Leskov among authors that had helped him form his own style and outlook. [...] "It was partly under Leskov's influence that <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out and see how real people lived," [...] he wrote. [...] "Leskov influenced me enormously, with his knowledge of the Russian language and its richness," [...] Gorky remarked in another letter.|$|E

2500|$|... "Tumble and Fall", {{the third}} track on Pushing the Senses, {{was chosen as}} its lead single, because their European label Play it Again Sam (PIAS), were getting more {{involved}} with the band, believing the song would be a crossover to make them successful in Europe after touring with Coldplay in 2003. The single became the band's most successful single release since [...] "Buck Rogers", reaching the top five in the UK. Grant claimed that [...] "Tumble and Fall" [...] is a love song, but can be interpreted in any way. In an interview with Feederweb, Grant said of the song: [...] "Again {{this is about the}} ups and downs of life. Its about life in general and how you deal with it. It covers the journey of life and how you have to take the ups with the downs. I wasn’t going to record this song. It took me a long time to finish it, to be happy with it, because the song went through various stages. I wasn’t sure if we really needed a tune like that on the album. But <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the studio to record an acoustic version just to see what happened and that’s how the song started. It was a completely one take vocal, live with the acoustic guitar and we built everything else around it. It is an acoustic track that grew into what it is now. So that was the only song that we recorded like that on the album, so it is a bit different for that reason and is probably why it has an organic feel to it".|$|E
2500|$|In March 2015, Nogueira {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with Combate that he had undergone stem cell therapy on his elbows, hips and knees. Nogueira said,"They have a clinic in Kansas where they work with stem cells. What they do is they remove some cells from fat out of your back and then inject them in your joints. I did it on my elbows, my hips and knees. It stimulates cartilage growth. It's pretty cutting edge technique. I'm responding really well so far. It's been helping a lot with my pain. I'm still doing physiotherapy, which is responsible for curing my hips, but I'm now doing this to make it even stronger. I had a break between my last fight and The Ultimate Fighter shootings, so <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> for it."Nogueira also confessed a desire to fight Frank Mir for a third time saying,"In two weeks I'll be cleared to train freely again. First, I will get my body strong enough so I can train and be 100% ready to fight. I intend to fight at UFC 190 in August. I wanted to come back at the TUF finale card, but I'm afraid there won't be enough time. I'll definitely be ready in August. The UFC told me they would put me in a card in August. They didn't say which one, but I'm sure it'll be the one in Rio. I still don't have an opponent. They said there were three different guys I could be fighting, but I can't comment on that. I don't have any preferences really. I just want to come back and fight, but I would like to face Frank Mir again {{before the end of the}} year." ...|$|E
2500|$|Infielder Stephen Drew {{returned}} from the disabled list, with Grace once again optioned to Syracuse, and the Nationals began a nine-game swing through California on May 29. On {{the first game of}} the road trip, the Nationals obtained their second shutout win of the year, beating the San Francisco Giants 3–0 behind a strong start by Tanner Roark. The game was marred, however, by an eighth-inning brawl that broke out after Giants reliever Hunter Strickland, facing Harper for the first time since the Nationals right fielder went 2-for-2 with two home runs off him during the 2014 National League Division Series, drilled Harper in the hip with a 98mph fastball with his first pitch. Harper tossed aside his bat and charged Strickland on the mound, throwing his helmet wide to the left of Strickland before the two players traded punches. They were separated by their teammates, with Giants first baseman and former National Michael Morse quickly getting between them before being bowled over (and concussed) by Giants pitcher and former University of Notre Dame football star Jeff Samardzija, and ejected from the game. Harper said after the game that he decided immediately that the pitch was intentional: [...] "You never want to get suspended or anything like that, but sometimes you've got to go and get him. You can't hesitate. You either go to first base or you go after him, and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> after him." [...] He suggested Strickland was retaliating for the 2014 home runs (which Strickland denied), saying, [...] "It was three years ago. ... I don't know why he's thinking about it. He's got a World Series ring, it's on his finger, and he can look at it every single night he wants to." [...] Both Harper and Strickland were issued suspensions by Major League Baseball, with Harper receiving a four-game penalty, which was lowered on appeal to three games. He began serving the suspension on May 31.|$|E
