30|$|The {{investigated}} area {{is located}} on the Southeastern Anatolia Edgefolds of the Anatolian Tectonic complex separated by Ketin (1966), and positioned in the southern side of the Anatolids and represents nearly 1000  km 2 area (Fig.  1 a). The Hekimhan Basin formed as part of the northern margin of the Taurides during the collision of the Inner Tauride Ocean and the İzmir–Ankara–Erzincan ocean (Fig.  1 a). The units in this area have mainly folded and fractured structure because of being influenced by Alpine Orogenesis. A constant sedimentary sequence has been loaded on the overthrusts that occurred in the Late Kimmeridge Phase of Early Alpine Orogenesis, starting from Maastrichtian until Upper Miocene begining. Campanian–Maastrichtian aged transgressive and regressive series present the common crop area (Şengör and Yılmaz 1981; Booth et al. 2014). This basin has been precipitated together with shallow marine and continental sedimentation, which is the case in the other basins of Central Anatolia, which reflects the clastic and carbonate precipitation in common. Maastrichtian sediments, which are rich in <b>detritics,</b> and coral reef limestone that contain rudist (Hippurites sp.) show the precipitation process of the basin in early periods (Gürer 1992).|$|R

Based on radiocarbon chronologies on several pollen diagrams along the western Dead Sea shore, the transition to drier climates and the transition to pastoralism are suggested to take place between a few decades before the Islamic period and close to this transition.

In their upper section (Ludlow), the shales incorporate calcareous horizons and calcareous nodules (with conodonts, nautiloids, bivalves, crinoids, and ostracods). Close to the Basque massifs, the calcareous facies changes into a <b>detritic</b> facies of interlayered sand- and silt-stones.

50|$|The basal Hettangian-Sinemurian {{sequence}} is fully transgressive over basement rocks or Permo-Triassic sediments. At that time, the first open-marine sediments (yet rather poor in fossils) were being {{deposited in the}} Aquitaine Basin. The Lias Transgression, as it is also called, started to encroach on the entire Aquitaine during the Sinemurian, characterised by calcareous-dolomitic, partially oolitic sediments. Despite smaller regressions during the Pliensbachian {{towards the end of}} the Lias and at the beginning of the Dogger the sea had onlapped the basement rocks of the Massif Central and the western Vendée (reaching today's limits) by 30 km. On the Aquitaine Plateau in the north, an interior shelf was constructed as far south as the line La Rochelle-Angoulême-Périgueux-Figeac. On this shelf the generally <b>detritic</b> transgression sediments of the Hettangian normally comprise a base conglomerate, arkoses, and fairly thick layers of sand- and mud-stones rich in plant material. The rest of the Hettangian is made up of marine sediments deposited in a restricted environment (lagoonal) evolving towards a lacustrine facies (green shales, coloured marls, dolomitic limestones and platy limestones rich in dwarf fossils, and evaporitic interlayers). The sediments of the Sinemurian are again fully marine and carry a pelagic fauna (soft banded limestones and hard lithographic limestones). At the end of the Sinemurian, a sudden regression occurred, forming hardgrounds.|$|E
