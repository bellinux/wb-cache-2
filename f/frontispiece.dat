5|$|In 1916, Potter {{completed}} a new <b>frontispiece</b> for the tale, and A Fierce Bad Rabbit was reprinted {{in a slightly}} smaller format than the other books in the Peter Rabbit library. Today, the book is printed in the standard small format of the series.|$|E
5|$|The 28th edition is {{illustrated}} with 60, mostly small, engravings. There is a full-page <b>frontispiece</b> of the author, drawn by Auguste Hervieu and engraved by Samuel Freeman (1773–1857). Freeman {{is known for}} working mainly in stipple, and the portrait here is no exception.|$|E
50|$|At {{this time}} he also did {{illustrations}} for other books, designed book jackets, <b>frontispieces</b> and end papers. In 1923 he illustrated The Florentine Dagger by Ben Hecht, and <b>frontispieces</b> for Blackguard by Maxwell Bodenheim and The Shining Pyramid by Arthur Machen.|$|R

5|$|Nina Leen's 1951 Life {{photograph}} {{has become}} the touchstone for canonical lists of the New York School. Irving Sandler used it as the <b>frontispiece</b> and rear dust jacket photograph of his The Triumph of American Painting: A History of Abstract Expressionism, published in 1970. This book defined Abstract Expressionism for a generation of scholars.|$|E
5|$|The Droeshout {{portrait}} or Droeshout engraving is {{a portrait}} of William Shakespeare engraved by Martin Droeshout as the <b>frontispiece</b> for the title page of the First Folio collection of Shakespeare's plays, published in 1623. It {{is one of only}} two works of art definitively identifiable as a depiction of the poet; the other is the statue erected as his funeral monument in Shakespeare's home town of Stratford-upon-Avon. Both are posthumous.|$|E

5|$|The first {{complete}} {{collection of}} the Drapier's Letters appeared in the 1734 George Faulkner edition of the Works of Jonathan Swift along with an allegorical <b>frontispiece</b> offering praise and thanks from the Irish people. Today, the Drapier's Letters {{are an important part}} of Swift's political writings, along with Gulliver's Travels (1726), A Tale of a Tub (1704), and A Modest Proposal (1729).|$|E
5|$|A Genji Album, {{only in the}} 1970s {{dated to}} 1510, is housed at Harvard University. The album is {{considered}} the earliest of its kind and consists of 54 paintings by Tosa Mitsunobu and 54 sheets of calligraphy on shikishi paper in five colors, written by master calligraphers. The leaves are housed in a case dated to the Edo period, with a silk <b>frontispiece</b> painted by Tosa Mitsuoki, dated to around 1690. The album contains Mitsuoki's authentication slips for his ancestor's 16th-century paintings.|$|E
5|$|Aalborg's {{old city}} hall in Gammeltorv, in service until 1912, {{was built in}} 1762. It is now only used for {{ceremonial}} and representative purposes. Designed in the Late Baroque style, the building with its black-glazed tile roof consists of two storeys and a cellar. The yellow-washed façade is decorated with white pilasters and a <b>frontispiece</b> featuring the Danish coat of arms and a bust of King Frederick V. His motto, Prudentia et Constantia, is also seen above the main entrance. The well-preserved door {{is an example of}} the Rococo style. The building was listed by the Danish Heritage Agency in 1918.|$|E

5|$|Bird {{designed}} the distinctive dust jacket– {{a collage of}} newspaper articles in four languages– to highlight that the vignettes carried a sense of journalism or news. The <b>frontispiece</b> is a woodcut portrait of the author, which during the printing process bled through to the next page, ruining {{more than half the}} print run so that only 170 of the 300 copies printed were deemed suitable to sell. The rest were sent to reviewers and friends.|$|E
5|$|By 1916 Frederick Warne & Co had {{discontinued}} Miss Moppet in its panorama format, and republished {{the story}} in a book format that year. Potter illustrated a <b>frontispiece</b> of the kitten and mouse seated in profile, and a title page vignette of a mouse on all fours facing the reader for the book format. At , the book's dimensions were smaller than other Peter Rabbit books. In 1917, she suggested to her publisher that Appley Dapply's Nursery Rhymes {{be published in the}} smaller Miss Moppet format.|$|E
5|$|Fuseli's Nightmare reverberated with twentieth-century {{psychological}} theorists. In 1926, American writer Max Eastman paid a {{visit to}} Sigmund Freud and claimed to have seen a print of The Nightmare displayed next to Rembrandt's The Anatomy Lesson in Freud's Vienna apartment. Psychoanalyst and Freud biographer Ernest Jones chose another version of Fuseli's painting as the <b>frontispiece</b> of his book On the Nightmare (1931); however, neither Freud nor Jones mentioned these paintings in their writings about dreams. Carl Jung included The Nightmare and other Fuseli works in his Man and His Symbols (1964).|$|E

50|$|The series also {{included}} new covers and <b>frontispieces</b> produced by {{artists such as}} Art Adams (issues #1-16, 18-23), Steve Lightle (#30-42, 44-52), and Mike Mignola (#57-70).|$|R

5|$|The 1790 edition was {{the only}} one to appear in Bellman's lifetime. It was {{published}} by Olof Åhlström, by royal privilege; he held a monopoly on the printing of sheet music in Sweden. Åhlström arranged the songs for piano, and Kellgren edited the song texts and wrote an introduction, but the extent of their influence on the shape of Fredman's Epistles cannot be fully determined. The edition was illustrated with a <b>frontispiece</b> by the leading Swedish artist Johan Tobias Sergel, engraved by Johan Fredrik Martin.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the scene is a pastiche of the <b>frontispiece</b> of Andreas Vesalius's De humani corporis fabrica, and it possibly also borrows from Quack Physicians' Hall (c. 1730) by the Dutch artist Egbert van Heemskerck, {{who had lived in}} England and whose work Hogarth admired. An earlier source of inspiration may have been a woodcut in the 1495 Fasciculo di medicina by Johannes de Ketham which, although simpler, has many of the same elements, including the seated president flanked by two windows.|$|E
5|$|The {{entire body}} {{of the book is}} {{arranged}} as a dictionary from Aberdevine ('Vide Siskin.) on page 58 (the pages are however not numbered in the original) to Yelper ('Vide Avoset.) on page 687. Since the book does not have a continuous narrative to summarise, the account here will use one species as a running example to illustrate the book's approach. The cirl bunting is chosen because it was discovered by Montagu and is associated in Britain with his home town of Kingsbridge, Devon. He also chose the species for the colour <b>frontispiece</b> of the book.|$|E

5|$|None of Monteverdi's {{music for}} Andromeda has survived. The {{libretto}} was also {{thought to have}} been lost, until its rediscovery in 1984. As was customary in Monteverdi's time, the manuscript makes no mention of the composer's name—librettos were often the subject of numerous settings by different composers. The libretto's <b>frontispiece</b> confirms that Andromeda was performed during Mantua's Carnival, 1–3 March 1620. An analysis of its contents reveals some influence from Rinuccini's libretto for Arianna, such as use of identical metre and length in the prologues of each work, and several common characters in the respective cast lists. The document remains in private hands and has not been published.|$|E
5|$|The Front of the Stage is open'd, and the Band of 24 Violins, {{with the}} Harpsicals and Theorbo's which {{accompany}} the Voices, are plac'd between the Pit and the Stage. While the Overture is playing, the Curtain rises, and discovers a new <b>Frontispiece,</b> joyn'd {{to the great}} Pylasters, {{on each side of}} the Stage... Behind this is the Scene, which represents a thick Cloudy Sky, a very Rocky Coast, and a Tempestuous Sea in perpetual Agitation. This Tempest (suppos'd to be rais'd by Magick) has many dreadful Objects in it, as several Spirits in horrid shapes flying down amongst the Sailers, then rising and crossing in the Air. And when the Ship is sinking, the whole House is darken'd, and a shower of Fire falls upon 'em. This is accompanied with Lightning, and several Claps of Thunder, to the end of the Storm.|$|E
5|$|The five-storey City Terminus Hotel, which fronted the station, {{was opened}} in May 1867. It was an Italianate style hotel and forecourt, {{designed}} by E. M. Barry, and it provided {{many of the}} station's passenger facilities, {{as well as an}} appropriate architectural <b>frontispiece</b> to the street. This arrangement was very similar to that put in place at Charing Cross. The hotel was not profitable, and was over £47,000 (now £) in debt by 1870. The City Terminus Hotel was renamed the Cannon Street Hotel in 1879. In July 1920, the hotel was the first meeting point of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Most of the hotel was closed in 1931, but the public rooms were kept open for meetings. The rest were converted into offices and renamed Southern House.|$|E
