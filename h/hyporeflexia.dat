5|$|A second form of neuroacanthocytosis, Levine-Critchley syndrome, was {{discovered}} by the American internist Irvine M. Levine in 1960 and reported in Neurology in 1964, and again in 1968. Subsequently, similar symptoms were identified and described by the British neurologist MacDonald Critchley in 1968. In both cases, the physicians described a hereditary syndrome that combined acanthocytosis with neurological peculiarities but normal serum lipoprotein. Specific symptoms included tics, grimacing, movement disorders, difficulty swallowing, poor coordination, <b>hyporeflexia,</b> chorea, and seizures. Patients often mutilated their tongues, lips, and cheeks. The diseases appeared in both sexes, and were usually diagnosed in infancy.|$|E
25|$|Paralysis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{pronounced}} effects of damage to α-MNs. Because α-MNs provide the only voluntary innervation to extrafusal muscle fibers, losing α-MNs effectively severs the connection between the brainstem and spinal cord and the muscles they innervate. Without this connection, voluntary and involuntary (reflex) muscle control is impossible. Voluntary muscle control is lost because α-MNs relay voluntary signals from upper motor neurons to muscle fibers. Loss of involuntary control results from interruption of reflex circuits such as the tonic stretch reflex. A consequence of reflex interruption is that muscle tone is reduced, resulting in flaccid paresis. Another consequence is the depression of deep tendon reflexes, causing <b>hyporeflexia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyporeflexia</b> {{may have}} other causes, {{including}} hypothyroidism, electrolyte imbalance (e.g. excess magnesium), drug induced (e.g. {{the symptoms of}} benzodiazepine intoxication include confusion, slurred speech, ataxia, drowsiness, dyspnea, and <b>hyporeflexia).</b>|$|E

50|$|Reports of {{overdose}} {{indicate that}} baclofen may cause symptoms including vomiting, weakness, sedation, somnolence, respiratory depression, seizures, unusual pupil size, dizziness, headaches, itching, hypothermia, bradycardia, hypertension, <b>hyporeflexia,</b> coma, and death.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyporeflexia</b> {{refers to}} below normal or absent {{reflexes}} (areflexia). It {{can be detected}} {{through the use of}} a reflex hammer. It is the opposite of hyperreflexia.Hyporeflexia is generally associated with a lower motor neuron deficit (at the alpha motor neurons from spinal cord to muscle), whereas hyperreflexia is often attributed to upper motor neuron lesions (along the long, motor tracts from the brain). The upper motor neurons are thought to inhibit the reflex arc, which is formed by sensory neurons from intrafusal fibers of muscles, lower motor neurons (including alpha and gamma motor fibers) and appurtenant interneurons. Therefore, damage to lower motor neurons will subsequently result in <b>hyporeflexia</b> and/or areflexia.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} of SSADH deficiency fall into three primary categories: neurological, psychiatric, and ocular. The most constant features seen are developmental delay, hypotonia and intellectual disability. Nearly half of patients seen manifest ataxia, behavior problems, seizures, and <b>hyporeflexia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rarely {{allergical}} reactions {{may occur}} (from dermal or mucosal symptoms to anaphylactic shock). At overdosing a toxical reaction arises - excitation, agitation, dishevelment, visual defects, buzzing in ears, muscle thrill to tremor, in more severe cases somnolence, <b>hyporeflexia,</b> breathing defects to apnea, convulsions.|$|E
5000|$|West Nile virus {{encephalitis}} (WNE) is {{the most}} common neuroinvasive manifestation of WNND. WNE presents with similar symptoms to other viral encephalitis with fever, headaches, and altered mental status. A prominent finding in WNE is muscular weakness (30 to 50 percent of patients with encephalitis), often with lower motor neuron symptoms, flaccid paralysis, and <b>hyporeflexia</b> with no sensory abnormalities.|$|E
50|$|CMV polyradiculomyelopathy (PRAM) {{is one of}} {{the five}} {{distinct}} neurological syndromes caused by CMV in HIV/AIDS. It causes subacute ascending lower extremity weakness with paresthesias and radicular pain, <b>hyporeflexia</b> or areflexia, and urinary retention. It has been suggested that CMV polyradiculomyelopathy should be treated with both ganciclovir and foscarnet in patients who develop the disease while taking either of these drugs.|$|E
50|$|Damage {{to upper}} motor neuron axons in {{the spinal cord}} results in a {{characteristic}} pattern of ipsilateral deficits. These include hyperreflexia, hypertonia and muscle weakness. Lower motor neuronal damage results in its own characteristic pattern of deficits. Rather than an entire side of deficits, there is a pattern relating to the myotome affected by the damage. Additionally, lower motor neurons are characterized by muscle weakness, hypotonia, <b>hyporeflexia</b> and muscle atrophy.|$|E
5000|$|The neuromuscular {{symptoms}} of hypercalcemia {{are caused by}} a negative bathmotropic effect due to the increased interaction of calcium with sodium channels. Since calcium blocks sodium channels and inhibits depolarization of nerve and muscle fibers, increased calcium raises the threshold for depolarization. This results in diminished deep tendon reflexes (<b>hyporeflexia),</b> and skeletal muscle weakness. [...] There is a general mnemonic for remembering the effects of hypercalcaemia: [...] "Stones, Bones, Groans, Thrones and Psychiatric Overtones" ...|$|E
50|$|The {{strength}} of a reflex is used to gauge central and peripheral nervous system disorders, with the former resulting in hyperreflexia, or exaggerated reflexes, and the latter resulting in <b>hyporeflexia</b> or diminished reflexes. However, the {{strength of}} the stimulus used to extract the reflex also affects the magnitude of the reflex. Attempts have been made to determine the force required to elicit a reflex, but vary depending on the hammer used, and are difficult to quantify.|$|E
5000|$|Spinal shock {{was first}} defined by Whytt in 1750 as {{a loss of}} [...] {{accompanied}} by motor paralysis with initial loss but gradual recovery of reflexes, following a spinal cord injury (SCI) - most often a complete transection. Reflexes in the spinal cord {{below the level of}} injury are depressed (<b>hyporeflexia)</b> or absent (areflexia), while those above the level of the injury remain unaffected. The 'shock' in spinal shock does not refer to circulatory collapse, and {{should not be confused with}} neurogenic shock, which is life-threatening ...|$|E
50|$|Anterior spinal artery {{syndrome}} is necrosis of {{tissue in the}} anterior spinal artery or its branches. It is characterised by pain which radiates at onset and sudden quadraplegia (paralysis of all four limbs) or paraplegia (paralysis of the lower body). Within days, flaccid limbs become spastic and <b>hyporeflexia</b> (underactive nerve responses) turns into hyperreflexia (overactive nerve responses) and extensor plantar nerve responses. Sensory loss to pain and temperature also occurs up {{to the level of}} damage on the spinal cord, as damage to different areas will affect different parts of the body.|$|E
5000|$|Nemaline Myopathy {{is caused}} by {{mutations}} in one of at least 10 different genes. [...] Nemaline myopathy is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder and both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms can occur. Diagnosis is made based upon clinical signs such as muscle weakness, absent or low deep tendon reflexes (<b>hyporeflexia),</b> and a high-arched palate, along with electron-dense aggregates, called nemaline rods, being observed at the microscopic level within muscle fibers. Genetic confirmation through identification of a known genetic mutation in the patient {{is also an important}} component of diagnosis.|$|E

50|$|Mild {{hypokalemia}} {{is often}} without symptoms, {{although it may}} cause elevation of blood pressure, and can provoke {{the development of an}} abnormal heart rhythm. Severe hypokalemia, with serum potassium concentrations of 2.5-3 meq/l (Nl: 3.5-5.0 meq/l), may cause muscle weakness, myalgia, tremor, and muscle cramps (owing to disturbed function of skeletal muscle), and constipation (from disturbed function of smooth muscle). With more severe hypokalemia, flaccid paralysis and <b>hyporeflexia</b> may result. Reports exist of rhabdomyolysis occurring with profound hypokalemia with serum potassium levels less than 2 meq/l. Respiratory depression from severe impairment of skeletal muscle function is found in many patients.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also used}} to {{counteract}} an overdose of Epsom Salts magnesium sulfate, which is often administered to pregnant women in order to prophylactically prevent seizures (as in a patient experiencing preeclampsia). Magnesium sulfate is no longer given to pregnant women who are experiencing premature labor in order to slow or stop their contractions (other tocolytics are now used instead due to better efficacy and side effect profiles). Excess magnesium sulfate results in magnesium sulfate toxicity, which results in both respiratory depression and a loss of deep tendon reflexes (<b>hyporeflexia).</b> Calcium gluconate is the antidote for magnesium sulfate toxicity.|$|E
50|$|Xylazine {{administration}} {{can lead to}} diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia. Other possible side effects that can occur are areflexia, asthenia, ataxia, blurred vision, disorientation, dizziness, drowsiness, dysarthria, dysmetria, fainting, <b>hyporeflexia,</b> slurred speech, somnolence, staggering, coma, apnea, shallow breathing, sleepiness, premature ventricular contraction, tachycardia, miosis, and dry mouth. Rarely, hypotonia, dry mouth, urinary incontinence and nonspecific electrocardiographic ST segment changes occur. It {{has been reported that}} the duration of symptoms after human overdose is 8 to 72 hours. Further research is necessary to categorize the side effects that occur when xylazine is used in conjunction with heroin and cocaine.|$|E
50|$|Symptoms usually begin insidiously between {{adolescence}} and age 45. Syringomyelia develops {{in the center}} of the spinal cord, causing a central cord syndrome. Pain and temperature sensory deficits occur early but may not be recognized for years. The first abnormality recognized may be a painless burn or cut. Syringomyelia typically causes weakness, atrophy, and often fasciculations and <b>hyporeflexia</b> of the hands and arms; a deficit in pain and temperature sensation in a capelike distribution over the shoulders, arms and back is characteristic. Light touch and position and vibration sensation are not affected. Later, spastic leg weakness develops. Deficits may be asymmetric.|$|E

5000|$|Succinic semialdehyde {{dehydrogenase}} deficiency (SSADHD), {{also known}} as 4-hydroxybutyric aciduria or gamma-hydroxybutyric aciduria, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of the degradation pathway of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid, or GABA. The disorder has been identified in approximately 350 families, with a significant proportion being consanguineous families. [...] The first case was identified in 1981 and published in a Dutch clinical chemistry journal that highlighted {{a person with a}} number of neurological conditions such as delayed intellectual, motor, speech, and language as the most common manifestations. Later cases reported in the early 1990s began to show that hypotonia, <b>hyporeflexia,</b> seizures, and a nonprogressive ataxia were frequent clinical features as well.|$|E
50|$|Signal {{intensity}} on a T2 image may be {{a result}} of edema or an inflammatory response. Because this type of imaging is a water detecting sequence, any form of calcification or mineralization would also appear dark, thus explaining why accumulation of extra blood or fluid would appear bright on a T2 image. Another explanation for signal intensity may be demyelination since the globus pallidi are traversed by a number of myelinated axons, thus confirming Ren and Mody’s 2003 work proving that repeated exposure of GHB to MAP kinase affected myelin expression, thus causing the numerous neurological dysfunctions seen in SSADH deficiency patients. Ultimately, because the globus pallidus is intimately linked with the basal ganglia and thalamus, it would be expected that some of the motor dysfunctions seen in SSADH patients such as ataxia and <b>hyporeflexia</b> would be common.|$|E
50|$|Blood {{samples are}} {{assessed}} {{for the absence}} or presence of aldosterone and cortisol. Physical examinations are also useful in patients {{in order to examine}} vision, skin pigmentation, how the body replaces steroids, and the cranial nerves. Recent advancements in high-resolution MRIs allow for adenomas to be detected during the early stages of Nelson syndrome. Physical examination including height, weight, vital signs, blood pressure, eye examination, thyroid examination, abdominal examination, neurological examination, skin examination and pubertal staging needs to be assessed. Through blood pressure and pulse readings can indicate hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency. Hyper-pigmentation, <b>hyporeflexia,</b> and loss of vision can also indicate Nelson's syndrome when assessed together. Specifically for a child who might have Nelson's syndrome, the patient should be questioned about the symptoms of the disease, and well as symptoms of other diseases to narrow down which disease the patient presents with. The patient should be questioned about how often and to what degree headaches, visual disturbances, and symptoms associated with pituitary malfunction occur. Additionally, adrenal steroid replacement should be assessed, especially in children who have prior insufficiency associated with the adrenal gland.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe {{vestibular}} evoked myogenic {{potential is}} a potential of mean latency that measures the muscle response to auditory stimulation.

40|$|When {{lidocaine}} is locally delivered {{into the}} inner ear, it rapidly paralyzes the peripheral vestibular afferent neu-rons and induces unilateral vestibular loss. The goals {{of this study were}} to explore the possibility of developing intratympanic injection (IT) of lidocaine as a modality for treating acute vertigo. To evaluate the minimum con-centration required, latent time, action duration, and possibility of lidocaine IT readministration to the vestib-ular system, we compared the development of horizontal nystagmus after IT of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 % lidocaine solutions in rats. To identify the induction of vestibular compensation, c-Fos-like protein expression was observed in the vestibular nucleus. Results of our investigation showed that lidocaine IT concentrations greater than 4 % induced vestibular <b>hyporeflexia</b> in the injected ear. In order to induce <b>hyporeflexia</b> 4 and 6 % lidocaine solutions could also be repeatedly injected. Regardless of concentration, effects of the lidocaine IT dissipated gradually over time.

40|$|Hypertonia and hypereflexia are classically {{described}} {{responses to}} upper motor neuron injury. However, acute hypotonia and areflexia with motor deficit are hallmark findings after many {{central nervous system}} insults such as acute stroke and spinal shock. Historic theories to explain these contradictory findings have implicated a number of potential mechanisms mostly relying on the loss of descending corticospinal input as the underlying etiology. Unfortunately, these simple descriptions consistently fail to adequately explain the pathophysiology and connectivity leading to acute <b>hyporeflexia</b> and delayed hypereflexia that result from such insult. This article highlights the common observation of acute <b>hyporeflexia</b> after central nervous system insults and explores the underlying anatomy and physiology. Further, evidence for the underlying connectivity is presented and implicates the dominant role of supraspinal inhibitory influence originating in the supplementary motor area descending through the corticospinal tracts. Unlike traditional explanations, this theory more adequately explains the findings of postoperative supplementary motor area syndrome in which hyporeflexive motor deficit is observed acutely {{in the face of}} intact primary motor cortex connections to the spinal cord. Further, the proposed connectivity can be generalized to help explain other insults including stroke, atonic seizures, and spinal shock...|$|E
