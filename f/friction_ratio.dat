Methodology includes air from a blower entering the test section through orificemeter and differential-micro manometer to measure the flow rate and pressure drop across the test section. Depending upon the pressure drops, friction factors for smooth and rough surface of the duct are estimated. The effect of geometrical parameters of delta wing and duct aspect <b>ratio</b> on <b>friction</b> factor <b>ratios</b> are reported Based on Reynolds number in the range of 8000 − 24000. The geometrical parameters of vortex generators varied in this study were the pitch-to-vortex generator height ratio (p/e), vortex generator height to duct hydraulic diameter ratio (e/Dh), aspect ratio of vortex generator (ar). Results are reported for 0. 1 <e/Dh< 0. 5, p/e= 4, 8, 12, 16, (ar) = 1. 6, 2. 3, 4, N= 1 in ducts having aspect ratio AR= 1, Detailed friction factor analysis for Re 8000 − 24000 has been presented for different configurations of vortex generators used in the square duct. The experimental {{results of the present study}} for friction factor in smooth square duct matches well with values taken from formula proposed by Blasius. The <b>friction</b> factor <b>ratio</b> increases with increase in e/Dh value, which may be attributed to increased blockage of the flow passage. For a given p/e, increasing e/Dh ratio for the same (ar) has the effect of increasing circulation strength and core size of the vortex thereby offering more resistance to flow that results into a higher <b>friction</b> factor <b>ratio.</b> The results have been presented in the form of the <b>friction</b> factor <b>ratio</b> of the roughened and smooth ducts operating at equal Reynolds numbers.

A rectangular brass plate {{is attached to a}} heating unit and fixed inside the test section of a subsonic wind tunnel. A number of non-metallic fences with different heights are used separately to promote turbulence over the plate. A series of experiments are conducted to examine the following parameters: fence height to plate length ratio (H/L), the distance between the fence and plate relative to plate length (S/L) and the Reynolds number, which is calculated based on the stream wise length of the plate (1. 5 × 105 ≤ ReL≤ 4. 5 × 105). The first set of the results, which is obtained for the case of the flat plate without a fence, satisfied with other published results. The results in the cases of the plate placed downstream of a fence revealed that the Nusselt number and friction factor are critically dependent on the fence height and the distance between the fence and the plate.

The ribs are separated from the base wall to provide a small region of flow between the base wall and the ribs. Experiments have been conducted at Reynolds number ranging from 10000 – 17000 with rotation numbers varying from 0 – 0. 38. Pitch-to-rib height ratios (P/e) of 5 and 10 at constant rib height-to-hydraulic diameter ratio (e/D) of 0. 1 and a clearance ratio (C/e) of 0. 38 are considered. The rib angle of attack with respect to mainstream flow is 90 ∘. The channel orientation at which the ribbed wall becomes trailing surface (pressure side on which the Coriolis force acts) is considered as the 0 ∘ orientation angle. For one-wall ribbed case, channel is oriented from 0 ∘ to 180 ∘ about its axis in steps of 30 ∘ to change the orientation angle. For two-wall ribbed case, the orientation angle is changed from 0 ∘ to 90 ∘ in steps of 30 ∘. Friction factors for the detached ribbed channels are compared with the corresponding attached ribbed channel. It is found that in one-wall detached ribbed channel, increase in the <b>friction</b> factor <b>ratio</b> with the orientation angle is lower for rectangular channel compared to that of square channel for both the pitch-to-rib height ratios of 5 and 10 at a given Reynolds number and rotation number. <b>Friction</b> factor <b>ratios</b> of two-wall detached ribbed rectangular channel are comparable with corresponding two-wall detached ribbed square channel both under stationary and rotating conditions...|$|R
