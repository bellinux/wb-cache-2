60|$|Then James {{began his}} <b>examination</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief,</b> and, {{following}} the lines {{which he had}} laid down in his opening speech, led her slowly, whilst allowing her to tell her own story as much as possible, {{to the time of}} the tattooing of the will on Kerguelen Land. All along, the history had evidently interested everybody in the court--not excepting the Judge--intensely; but now the excitement rose to boiling point.|$|E
60|$|Your Committee found great {{impediment}} in {{the production}} of evidence, not only on account of the general doctrines supposed to exist concerning its inadmissibility, drawn from its own alleged natural incompetency, or from its inapplicability under the pleading of the impeachment of this House, but also from the mode of proceeding in bringing it forward. Here evidence which we thought necessary to the elucidation of the cause was not suffered, upon the supposed rules of <b>examination</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> and cross-examination, and on supposed rules forming a distinction between evidence originally produced on the charge and evidence offered on the reply.|$|E
5000|$|Muir {{was known}} to be hard working with little need for conviviality. He usually spent half the night {{preparing}} for his cases, making notations on small cards with coloured pencils — one colour for <b>examination</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief,</b> one colour for cross examination, and so on. So ubiquitous were those cards that {{came to be known as}} Muir's [...] "playing cards". He was rightfully feared by his clerks and officers from Scotland Yard who gathered his evidence from him, for he asked the same thoroughness from them as from himself. He depended a lot from physical evidence, while giving eyewitness testimony little credence, except if it would bolster existing, more concrete evidence.|$|E
50|$|Later Liang was {{replaced}} by the Later Tang in 926, and Fàn passed the imperial <b>examination</b> <b>in</b> 933. The <b>chief</b> <b>examination</b> administrator He Ning (和凝) reportedly liked Fàn's writing the most that he intentionally assigned Fàn 13th place, which was the placing he himself got back in the day. Fàn became a prefectural judge (推官) for the Zhongwu Commandery (忠武軍; roughly governing today's central Henan), and was later promoted to the post of subprefect of Fengqiu which he served until Later Tang was overthrown in 936.|$|R

5000|$|Marshall Hall {{dramatically}} commenced his <b>examination</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> with: [...] "Robert Wood, did {{you kill}} Emily Dimmock?" [...] Wood remained silent. He {{was said to be}} a vain young man who could not cast aside his affectations; he appeared a [...] "poseur". Marshall Hall repeated the question; [...] "You must answer straight," [...] he said. Foolishly Wood answered, [...] "I mean, it is ridiculous," [...] leaving Marshall Hall distressed. The rest of Wood's evidence proceeded in this way. He was later cross-examined by the might of the senior Treasury Counsel, Sir Charles Mathews, a mismatch if ever there was one. But in the end, Wood's silly little boy foolishness perhaps played in his favour; could he really have murdered Emily Dimmock? ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{revitalise}} {{the court and}} provide some procedural distinction from the High Court, {{a new set of}} procedural rules were introduced in Autumn 2010, {{at the same time that}} (as he then was) His Honour Colin Birss was appointed as the judge of the PCC. These rules meant that much more detail was required in the particulars of claim (the document that sets out the claimant's case), the procedure as a whole was streamlined further (no disclosure, no <b>examination</b> <b>in</b> <b>chief</b> of expert witness, tight control by the Judge of the issues that go to trial) and financial limits were introduced to both the damages (at £500,000) and the legal costs (at £50,000, with an additional cap per stage) recoverable. Trials should last no more than two days. [...] The revitalised court has been generally viewed as a success.|$|E
