40|$|A {{number of}} {{important}} material-related problems were identified and analyzed during the Phase-I study for INTOR. The first wall and <b>divertor</b> <b>collector</b> plate are subjected to severe normal and off-normal conditions. A melt layer is predicted to develop in a bare stainless steel wall under plasma disruptions. Graphite tiles will not melt but they introduce other serious uncertainties into the design. The design strategy for the <b>divertor</b> <b>collector</b> plate focused on separating the surface and high heat flux problems and on utilizing a novel mechanical design concept for attaching tungsten tiles to a stainless steel-(or copper) heat sink. ...|$|E
40|$|The uptake {{and release}} of {{hydrogen}} isotopes at the plasma-facing components in magnetic, confinement fusion devices affects the working gas recycling, the plasma behaviour and the tritium inventory [1]. This attracts considerable {{interest in the}} investigation of hydrogen trapping during plasma exposure. The most intensive plasma material interaction occurs on limiters and divertor plates. Post-mortem analysis of such components gives information on the total amount of hydrogen isotopes retained in the material after plasma exposure. Recent investigations of divertor tiles of ASDEX-UPGRADE have shown that the dominant trapped deuterium amount is contained in the deposited material at the surface [2]. This surface contamination consists mainly of carbon, boron and the hydrogenic isotopes. Movable collector probes have been applied to investigate the hydrogen trapping and impurity deposition under specific plasma conditions. In the present paper results on the impurity and deuterium contamination at the surface of collector samples are presented and compared with corresponding results from the <b>divertor</b> tiles. The <b>collector</b> samples were exposed to the scrape-off plasma of the main chamber (SOL-probe) and to the divertor plasma (DIV-probe...|$|R
