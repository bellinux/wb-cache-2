25|$|The West adopted {{many of the}} Byzantine {{iconographic}} elements, but {{preferred the}} stable rather than the cave, though Duccio's Byzantine-influenced Maestà version tries to have both. The midwives gradually dropped out from Western depictions, as Latin theologians disapproved of these legends; sometimes the bath remains, either being <b>got</b> <b>ready</b> or with Mary bathing Jesus. The midwives are still seen where Byzantine influence is strong, especially in Italy; as in Giotto, one may hand Jesus over to his mother. During the Gothic period, in the North earlier than in Italy, increasing closeness between mother and child develops, and Mary begins to hold her baby, or he looks over to her. Suckling is very unusual, but is sometimes shown.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the rebels}} had {{launched}} {{an attack on}} the boat from the opposite bank. After some firing, the British men on the boat decided to fly the white flag. They were escorted off the boat and taken back to Savada house. The surviving British men were sat on the ground, and Nana Sahib's soldiers <b>got</b> <b>ready</b> to fire on them. Their wives insisted that they would die with their husbands, but were pulled away. Nana Sahib granted the British chaplain Moncrieff's request to read prayers before they died. The British were initially wounded by the guns, and then killed with swords. The women and children were confined to Savada House, to be reunited later with their remaining colleagues, who had been captured earlier, at Bibighar.|$|E
25|$|Valencia {{began the}} {{following}} Liga season {{top of the}} league after ten matches. However, after the Christmas break, Valencia struggled to keep pace due to Champions League requirements. Héctor Cúper's team managed to eliminate Arsenal in the quarter-finals and Leeds United in the semi-finals, and <b>got</b> <b>ready</b> to face Bayern Munich in the final; Valencia had reached two European Cup finals in a row. This time, the final was played in Milan at the San Siro on 23 May. Gaizka Mendieta gave Valencia the lead by scoring from the penalty spot right {{at the start of}} the match. Goalkeeper Santiago Cañizares then stopped a penalty from Mehmet Scholl, but Stefan Effenberg put Bayern level after the break thanks to another penalty. After extra time, it went to penalties, where a Mauricio Pellegrino miss gave Bayern Champions League glory and dealt Valencia a second-straight defeat in the final. Valencia went on to slip to fifth place in La Liga and out of Champions League competition for the 2001–02 season. The final match of the season meant Valencia only needed a draw at the Camp Nou against Barcelona to seal Champions League qualification. However, Los Che lost 3–2 with a last minute goal from Rivaldo, resulting in Barcelona qualifying for the Champions League while Valencia missed out.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the authorship evidence provided by the ancient sources, some feel the text of Luke-Acts supports the conclusion that its author was a companion of Paul. First among such internal evidence are portions of the book which {{have come to be}} called the [...] "we" [...] passages ( [...] ; [...] ). Although the bulk of Acts is written in the third person, several brief sections of the book are written from a first-person perspective. These [...] "we" [...] sections are written {{from the point of view}} of a traveling companion of Paul: e.g. [...] "After Paul had seen the vision, we <b>got</b> <b>ready</b> at once to leave for Macedonia", [...] "We put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace" [...] Such passages would appear to have been written by someone who traveled with Paul during some portions of his ministry. Accordingly, some have used this evidence to support the conclusion that these passages, and therefore the entire text of the Luke-Acts, were written by a traveling companion of Paul's. The physician Luke would be one such person.|$|E

2500|$|St Lo's {{support for}} the Orangists secured his career, and he {{remained}} in command of Portsmouth after the revolution. He {{was present at the}} Battle of Bantry Bay on 1 May 1689, but while in the English Channel in August 1689, Portsmouth was attacked by the 58-gun French ship Marquis, and was captured. St Lo was severely injured in the seven-hour-long engagement, and was taken prisoner. The French took him to Brest, and then to Nantes, as a prisoner of war. St Lo spent the next two years a prisoner, a period he later claimed cost him £500 in expenses. He was paid £100 from the royal bounty, and his wife made a petition for him to be exchanged on 11 January 1691. His time spent in Brest and Nantes was put to good use in observing the French naval system, and in 1693 he published the pamphlet England's Safety, or a Bridle to the French King, based on his observations. Impressed by the speed of French naval preparations, he wrote that [...] "while [...] was at Brest, I was astonished by the expedition used by the French in manning and fitting out their ships, which, till then, I thought could be done no where sooner than in England, where we have ten times the shipping, and consequently ten times more seamen than they have in France.
