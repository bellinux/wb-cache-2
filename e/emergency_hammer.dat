25|$|All {{lighting}} {{was lost}} in all the coaches during the accident. As a result, passengers and crew found orientation difficult, though the provision of glow sticks alleviated this to some extent. Some passengers who attempted to break windows in order {{to escape from the}} vehicle were hampered by the <b>emergency</b> <b>hammers</b> breaking, and by the difficulty of reaching the upper windows of a vehicle leaning heavily to one side.|$|R
50|$|<b>Emergency</b> <b>hammers</b> can be {{purchased}} by consumers in store for their vehicles, homes, hotels etc to provide a means of escape should the doors/windows become unusable, such as in a collision, if the vehicle falls into water and is sinking or there is a fire within a building. However, people {{have been known to}} use these hammers to enter a car from the outside for purposes of burglary.|$|R

50|$|The first {{vehicles}} in the regions of Rhein-Ruhr and the Southwest were given a modernisation of the interior. The railcars were matched to the current DB interior design. The seats have blue cushions and arm rests made of beech wood, the walls are silvery, the luggage section completely white, the windows are equipped with <b>emergency</b> <b>hammers.</b> The colour of the entrance area is white, {{and in some cases}} larger bicycle sections were installed in the centre of the carriage. On some of the units, the doors were also fitted with sensors.|$|R
25|$|More than 20 {{ambulances}} {{from five}} counties and 14 fire engines attended the crash. Injured passengers were first helped at the Winning Hand pub, 300m north. After the collision survivors in some carriages used <b>emergency</b> <b>hammers</b> {{to break the}} train windows to escape. The accident occurred at night, and so passengers used emergency glow sticks and their mobile phones to provide some light. 61 injured passengers were taken variously to the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading and the North Hampshire Hospital in Basingstoke. Other passengers were treated at the scene and the Winning Hand pub for minor injuries.|$|R
50|$|Emergency hammers {{are also}} known as bus mallets, dotty hammers, safety mallets, and bus hammers. Many {{emergency}} hammers are attached to a cable or an alarm device to deter theft or misuse. Brands of <b>emergency</b> <b>hammer</b> include Lifeaxe and LifeHammer.|$|E
50|$|In Norway, {{the use of}} wrap {{advertising}} on buses was prohibited by the road authorities. The reason behind the ban was that in an emergency the windows might need {{to serve as an}} emergency exit, and that the advertising would make the window harder to break with the <b>emergency</b> <b>hammer.</b> Gaia Trafikk argued against the ban, pointing out that their tests showed that the thin wrap had no impact on the breakability of the window, but did remove the advertising which covered the windows.|$|E

5000|$|The fire {{ultimately}} affected 101 families. Following the incident, Li Shuguang, {{the chairman}} of the bus company resigned, saying he hoped his resignation would [...] "arouse society's attention to the safety of public transport." [...] A bus company in Chengdu promised to financially reward passengers who report others who bring flammable liquids or other prohibited items on board. The municipal governments of Beijing, Shenyang, and Guangzhou reacted by reviewing bus safety measures. Officials in Haikou outfitted public buses with 400 <b>emergency</b> <b>hammers,</b> but over half of the hammers were stolen from the buses within three days. As local hospitals were running low on blood needed for transfusions to help the victims, over 60 Chengdu citizens and 55 soldiers volunteered for blood donations after an urgent call from hospital authorities.|$|R

5|$|The third {{mission was}} begun in 1998. It was a {{search and rescue}} mission {{requiring}} fully autonomous robots to take off, fly to a disaster area and search for survivors and the dead amid raging fires, broken water mains, clouds of toxic gas, and rubble from destroyed buildings. The scenario was recreated at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hazardous Material Management and <b>Emergency</b> Response (<b>HAMMER)</b> training facility where the above hazards could be recreated. Because of the realism of the scenario, animatrons were used instead of human actors to simulate survivors incapable of extracting themselves from the disaster area.|$|R
5000|$|Structural {{design of}} trams can {{minimize}} {{the risks to}} tram drivers, tram passengers, pedestrians, and passengers in other vehicles in various kinds of tram-to-tram, tram-to-vehicle, and tram-to-pedestrian collisions. A European standard is being prepared for crashworthiness for railway vehicle bodies. The trams may contain emergency brakes. Protective shields {{in the front of}} the tram, [...] "catching" [...] people, avoid them getting underneath the tram (see an <b>emergency</b> <b>hammer</b> in [...] and a catcher in [...] ). In Toronto the CLRV streetcars have a skirt added to the front of the car covering the coupler. It was added to prevent passengers from being dragged under the car's wheels. Trams should be designed to have impact absorbing materials in front and side constructions. Lifting points can be marked for fire brigades to help rescuers to find safe and strong enough parts of the tram when e.g. lifting a tram to rescue a patient underneath it. Inside the tram the structures should also contain impact absorbing materials and round shapes instead of sharp edges (see interior material in [...] Automatic door controlling sensors decrease the possibility of entrapment injuries (see a tram door in [...] Handrails may prevent people falling in acceleration, curves and braking. Especially elderly people need seats and time to find one and sit before the tram moves. Trams can contain fire safe materials like low smoke and halogen-free cables, driver's vigilance control systems, and programmable logic speed controllers.|$|E
40|$|Crashes {{in which}} cars are {{submerged}} {{in deep water}} or in a ditch are often complicated and serious. Considering their severity {{and the fact that}} approximately half the fatalities in this crash type are not due to drowning but to injury, preventive measures are to be preferred above measures that have to assist the vehicle occupants to escape from a car submerged in water. An adequate road design, barrier constructions in road bends and shoulder surfacing, and education and information can reduce the risks of such crashes. Electronic stability control (ESC) also reduces the risk of running off the road and landing in water; this system will in due course be made compulsory for all new cars. If a car is indeed submerged in water, intelligent transport systems like eCall can speed up the arrival of assistance, thus reducing the consequences of the crash. Wearing seat belts is also, or in this case especially, important in reducing the injury severity of this crash type, thus increasing the chance of escape for the occupants when the car is submerged in water. It is also important {{to be aware of the}} fact that vehicle facilities such as a central door locking system and electric windows may be obstacles to escape. An <b>emergency</b> <b>hammer</b> within easy reach can be an essential tool to make it possible to escape from a car that has landed in water. Public information is necessary to tell drivers what to do when a car ends up in the water...|$|E
40|$|The Hazardous Material Management and Emergency Response Training and Education Center [...] known {{simply as}} HAMMER [...] is being {{developed}} to assist the US Department of Energy (DOE) and others dedicated to improving worker health, safety and productivity. HAMMER is a training and education program for hazardous material, waste management, and <b>emergency</b> response workers. <b>HAMMER</b> is managed by the DOE Richland Operations Office under Work Breakdown Structure (8. 2). The 1996 Multi-Year Program Plan (MYPP) includes the Execution Year data and provides the information for Programmatic Fiscal Year Site Management System Execution Baseline, {{as well as the}} detailed work plan for performance evaluation of the authorized work. The MYPP incorporates various planning methodologies to define the program and provides essential program integration, and a fully developed technical, cost, and schedule baseline. The MYPP will be utilized by WHC Program and Department Managers as the baseline management tool for status and progress monitoring, performance enhancement, impact analysis studies, and as the basis for detailed fiscal year and near-term planning...|$|R
500|$|The International Aerial Robotics Competition {{was first}} {{held on the}} campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology (first mission, 1991–1995). Walt Disney World's EPCOT Center asked that the {{competition}} move to its location for the second mission, where it was held at the entrance to the park during 1996 and 1997. The U.S. Department of Energy's Hazardous Material Management and <b>Emergency</b> Response (<b>HAMMER)</b> training facility then brought the IARC to Richland WA from 1998 to 2000 for the conduct of the third mission. The fourth mission began in 2001 at the U.S. Navy's Webster Field in Maryland, but was moved to the Canada Olympic Village (Calgary, Canada) the following year because Webster Field was unsuitable. Weather, difficulty in airspace management, and extreme electromagnetic interference drove the IARC to an ideal venue where these issues could be managed: the U.S. Army's Fort Benning Soldier Battle Lab, McKenna MOUT site.
