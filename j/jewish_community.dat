5|$|By {{the end of}} Henry's reign {{the king}} ceased to borrow from the <b>Jewish</b> <b>community</b> and instead turned to an {{aggressive}} campaign of tallage taxation and fines. Financial and anti-Semite violence grew under RichardI. After the massacre of the York community, in which numerous financial records were destroyed, seven towns were nominated to separately store Jewish bonds and money records and this arrangement ultimately evolved into the Exchequer of the Jews. After an initially peaceful start to John's reign, the king again began to extort money from the <b>Jewish</b> <b>community,</b> imprisoning the wealthier members, including Isaac of Norwich, until a huge, new taillage was paid. During the Baron's War of 1215–17, the Jews were subjected to fresh anti-Semitic attacks. HenryIII restored some order and Jewish money-lending became sufficiently successful again to allow fresh taxation. The <b>Jewish</b> <b>community</b> became poorer {{towards the end of}} the century and was finally expelled from England in 1290 by EdwardI, being largely replaced by foreign merchants.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by the 1782 Edict of Tolerance of Emperor Joseph II, Jews first {{permanently}} {{settled in}} Zagreb {{in the late}} eighteenth century, and founded the <b>Jewish</b> <b>community</b> in 1806.

As early as 1833, the community was permitted to buy land for construction of a synagogue, but did not have sufficient money to finance one at the time.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Jewish</b> <b>community</b> in England {{continued}} to provide essential money-lending and banking services that were otherwise {{banned by the}} usury laws, and grew in the 12th century by Jewish immigrants fleeing the fighting around Rouen. The <b>Jewish</b> <b>community</b> spread beyond London to eleven major English cities, primarily the major trading hubs in the east of England with functioning mints, all with suitable castles for protection of the often persecuted Jewish minority. By {{the time of the}} Anarchy and the reign of Stephen, the communities were flourishing and providing financial loans to the king.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Jewish</b> <b>community</b> {{played an}} {{important}} role in England throughout much of the period. The first Jews arrived in England in the aftermath of the Norman invasion, when William the Conqueror brought over wealthy members of the Rouen community in Normandy to settle in London. The <b>Jewish</b> <b>community</b> expanded out across England and provided essential money-lending and banking services that were otherwise banned by the usury laws. During the 12th century, the Jewish financial community grew richer still, operating under royal protection and providing the king with a source of ready credit. All major towns had Jewish centres, and even the smaller towns saw visits by travelling Jewish merchants. Towards the end of Henry II's reign, however, the king ceased to borrow from the <b>Jewish</b> <b>community</b> and instead turned to extracting money from them through arbitrary taxation and fines. The Jews became vilified and accusations were made that they conducted ritual child murder, encouraging the pogroms carried out against Jewish communities in the reign of Richard I. After an initially peaceful start to John's reign, the king again began to extort money from the <b>Jewish</b> <b>community</b> and, with the breakdown in order in 1215, the Jews were subject to fresh attacks. HenryIII restored some protection and Jewish money-lending began to recover. Despite this, the <b>Jewish</b> <b>community</b> became increasingly impoverished and was finally expelled from England in 1290 by EdwardI, being replaced by foreign merchants.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{increasing}} anti-British sentiment {{spread throughout}} the Arab World and led to riots in Bahrain.

In the 1950s, the National Union Committee, formed by reformists following sectarian clashes, demanded an elected popular assembly, removal of Belgrave and carried {{out a number of}} protests and general strikes. In 1965 a month-long uprising broke out after hundreds of workers at the Bahrain Petroleum Company were laid off.|$|E
