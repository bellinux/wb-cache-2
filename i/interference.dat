5|$|Gene {{expression}} in prokaryotes {{is influenced by}} an RNA-based system similar in some respects to RNAi. Here, RNA-encoding genes control mRNA abundance or translation by producing a complementary RNA that anneals to an mRNA. However these regulatory RNAs are not {{generally considered to be}} analogous to miRNAs because the dicer enzyme is not involved. It has been suggested that CRISPR <b>interference</b> systems in prokaryotes are analogous to eukaryotic RNA <b>interference</b> systems, although none of the protein components are orthologous.|$|E
40|$|Two {{forms of}} <b>interferences</b> are individuated in Cardelli and Gordon's Mobile Ambients (MA) : plain <b>interferences,</b> which {{are similar to}} the <b>interferences</b> one finds in CCS and pi-calculus; and grave <b>interferences,</b> which are more {{dangerous}} and may be regarded as programming errors. To control <b>interferences,</b> the MA movement primitives are modified. On the new calculus, the Mobile Safe Ambients (SA), a type system is defined that: controls the mobility of ambients; removes all grave <b>interferences.</b> Other advantages of SA are: a useful algebraic theory; programs sometimes more robust (they require milder conditions for correctness) and/or simpler. All these points are illustrated on several examples...|$|R

40|$|The {{synchronization}} and/or time acquisition {{problem in}} the presence of <b>interferences</b> has been strongly studied these last two decades, mainly to mitigate the multiple access <b>interferences</b> from other users in DS/CDMA systems. Among the available receivers, only some scarce receivers may also be used in other contexts such as F/TDMA systems. However, these receivers assume implicitly or explicitly circular (or proper) <b>interferences</b> and become suboptimal for noncircular (or improper) <b>interferences.</b> Such <b>interferences</b> are characteristic in particular of radio communication networks using either rectilinear (or monodimensional) modulations such as BPSK modulation or modulation becoming quasirectilinear after a preprocessing such as MSK, GMSK, or OQAM modulations. For this reason, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to introduce and to analyze the performance of second-optimal array receivers for synchronization and/or time acquisition of BPSK, MSK, and GMSK signals corrupted by noncircular <b>interferences.</b> For given performances and {{in the presence of}} rectilinear signal and <b>interferences,</b> the proposed receiver allows a reduction of the number of sensors by a factor at least equal to two. </p...|$|R
5|$|In both {{recording}} and in live musical sound reinforcement, {{the key to}} noise minimisation is headroom. Headroom can be used either to reduce distortion and audio feedback by keeping signal levels low, or to reduce <b>interference,</b> both from outside sources and from the Johnson-Nyquist noise produced in the equipment, by keeping signal levels high. Most proprietary noise reducing technologies also introduce low levels of distortion. Noise minimisation therefore becomes a compromise between <b>interference</b> and distortion, both in {{recording and}} in live music, and between <b>interference</b> and feedback in live amplification. The work of Bart Kosko and Sanya Mitaim has also demonstrated that stochastic resonance {{can be used as}} a technique in noise minimisation and signal improvement in non-linear dynamical systems, as the addition of noise to a signal can improve the signal-to-noise ratio.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{the good}} time-frequency {{localization}} of the pulse shaping, {{it is possible to}} build a multicarrier modulation that reduces both narrowband <b>interferences</b> and multipath chan-nel <b>interferences.</b> In this paper, the given solution is based on wavelet theory: wavelet packet based multicarrier mod-ulation is introduced and compared to the useful Orthogo-nal Frequency Domain Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation in a wireless environment with narrowband <b>interferences</b> and multipath channel <b>interferences.</b> Simulations show that the use of wavelet is more robust to narrowband <b>interferences</b> than the OFDM modulation.

30|$|The first-stage {{precoding}} can {{be designed}} per group individually, after user partition. However, inter-group <b>interferences</b> exist, because the eigenvector matrix of channel correlation is {{not exactly equal to}} the Kronecker product of the azimuth and elevation DFT prebeamformers. This is because in practice, the angular supports of users may be overlapping and users cannot be separated strictly. Moreover, the inter-group <b>interferences</b> are severe between the adjacent groups, and hence the multi-user precoders need to consider not only the intra-group <b>interferences</b> but also the adjacent-group <b>interferences.</b>|$|R

5|$|Two {{types of}} small ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules– microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)– {{are central to}} RNA <b>interference.</b> RNAs are the direct {{products}} of genes, and these small RNAs can bind to other specific messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules and either increase or decrease their activity, for example by preventing an mRNA from being translated into a protein.

In the case of two or more waves with different frequencies, their periodically changing phase relationship results in periodic alterations between constructive and destructive <b>interference,</b> giving rise to the phenomenon of amplitude fluctuations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLow {{resolution}} {{methods can}} provide exact mass data {{comparable to that}} obtained with high resolution instrumentation and offer potential advantages in throughput and robustness. However, low resolution exact mass techniques have realized limited use {{largely because of the}} possibility of errors caused by unresolved <b>interferences.</b> Here the utility of statistical peak shape analysis for determining unresolved <b>interferences</b> at low resolution is considered. Equations describing the effect of unresolved <b>interferences</b> on statistical peak shape parameters are developed and used to investigate the extent to which evaluations of peak shape can be used to reduce the likelihood of mass measurement errors. Peak shape analysis is shown to be a highly effective and sensitive method of determining unresolved <b>interferences.</b> Mass measurement errors resulting from undetermined <b>interferences</b> are found to increase with increasing relative abundance of the interfering peak, to increase with decreasing resolution, and to increase with decreasing precision in the intensity measurement. At low resolution, undetermined <b>interferences</b> as small as a few percent relative abundance can produce mass measurement errors in excess of 5 ppm. Peak shape analyses alone do not appear adequate to eliminate the risk of significant mass measurement errors resulting from unresolved <b>interferences</b> at low resolution...|$|R

25|$|Suppression {{capacitors}} {{are effective}} <b>interference</b> reduction components because their electrical impedance decreases with increasing frequency, {{so that at}} higher frequencies they short circuit electrical noise and transients between the lines, or to ground.

Furthermore, this cohort was in another continent, where other medications and infusion fluids are used [10].
