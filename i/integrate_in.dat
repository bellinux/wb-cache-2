5|$|The first FPÖ {{party leader}} was Anton Reinthaller, a former Nazi Minister of Agriculture and SS officer. He {{had been asked}} by ÖVP Chancellor Julius Raab {{to take over the}} {{movement}} rather than let it be led by a more socialist-leaning group. While the majority of former Nazis had probably joined the two main parties in absolute numbers, they formed a greater percentage of FPÖ members due to the party's small size. Nevertheless, none of them were real revolutionaries and they pursued pragmatic, non-ideological policies. The FPÖ served as a vehicle for them to <b>integrate</b> <b>in</b> the Second Republic; the party was a welcome partner with both the SPÖ and ÖVP in regional and local politics, although it was excluded at the national level. The ÖVP and the FPÖ ran a joint candidate for the 1957 presidential election, who lost.|$|E
25|$|Diversity between team members’ {{backgrounds}} and knowledge can increase team creativity by expanding the total collection of unique {{information that is}} available to the team and introducing different perspectives that can <b>integrate</b> <b>in</b> novel ways. However, under some conditions, diversity can also decrease team creativity by {{making it more difficult}} for team members to communicate about ideas and causing interpersonal conflicts between those with different perspectives. Thus, the potential advantages of diversity must be supported by appropriate team processes and organizational cultures in order to enhance creativity.|$|E
25|$|Murphy's work {{led to the}} {{establishment}} of thirty nine missions throughout Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi. In the late 1960s, her religious order was renamed the Sisters of the Holy Spirit and Mary Immaculate. The Sisters of the Holy Spirit also currently have outreach missions in Mexico and Zambia. Murphy's school later changed its name to the Healy Murphy Center. The Healy Murphy Center is currently operational and is located on Nolan Street in San Antonio, helping students who have dropped out of school. The school has continued to have an excellent reputation for academics. It also began to <b>integrate</b> <b>in</b> the 1940s and later became a non-religious charter school.

25|$|By {{the fall}} of 1965 both Ole Miss and Mississippi State University had been integrated– the former violently, the latter peacefully. McCain, USM and state leaders {{recognized}} the state needed to <b>integrate</b> <b>in</b> order to appeal to businesses from outside the state. They made extensive confidential plans for the admission of their first black students. A faculty guardian and tutor was secretly appointed for each {{to help with the}} transition. The campus police department was instructed to prevent or quickly stop any incident against the two black students. Student athletic, fraternity, and political leaders were recruited to keep the calm and protect the university from the kind of negative publicity that Ole Miss had suffered during rioting against Meredith's enrollment.|$|E
25|$|In the post-apartheid South Africa, blacks {{became more}} {{involved}} in leadership positions in South Africa, in areas like the National Olympic Committee of South Africa and in soccer. This {{was not the case}} with netball, which continued to be run by whites. During 1994, there were allegations of racism over the selection of players to the national squad. In 1995, the white only Stellenbosch had around fifteen netball courts and six hockey fields. A lack of a wider community identity hindered the ability of netball to racially <b>integrate</b> <b>in</b> the post-apartheid South Africa. In 1997, white women as participants still outnumbered their black South African counterparts. One of the sports contested is netball. Netball has a large spectator base composed of white women.|$|E
25|$|Judge John J.

Montgomery County Board of Education (1969), Judge Frank Johnson’s desegregation order for teachers was upheld, allowing an approximate ratio of the races to be established by a district judge.|$|E

25|$|There {{is a small}} {{community}} of Swedish-speaking immigrants in Finland. Many of them come from Sweden, or have resided there (about 8,500 Swedish citizens live in Finland and around 30,000 residents in Finland were born in Sweden), while others have opted for Swedish {{because it is the}} main language in the city in which they live, or because their partners are Swedish-speaking. About one quarter of immigrants in the Helsinki area would choose to <b>integrate</b> <b>in</b> Swedish if they had the option. According to a report by Finland's Swedish think tank, Magma, there is a widespread perception among immigrants that they are more easily integrated in the Swedish-speaking community than in the majority society. However, some immigrants also question whether they ever will be fully accepted as Finland Swedes. Swedish-speaking immigrants also have their own association, Ifisk and in the capital region there is a publicly financed project named Delaktig aimed at facilitating integration of immigrants who know or wish to learn Swedish. Most if not all immigrants also wish to be fluent in Finnish {{due to the fact that}} it is the dominant language in Finnish society.|$|E
25|$|Lentiviruses are a {{subclass}} of Retroviruses. They {{are sometimes}} used as vectors for gene therapy {{thanks to their}} ability to integrate into the genome of non-dividing cells, which is the unique feature of Lentiviruses as other Retroviruses can infect only dividing cells. The viral genome in the form of RNA is reverse-transcribed when the virus enters the cell to produce DNA, which is then inserted into the genome at a random position (recent findings actually suggest that the insertion of viral DNA is not random but directed to specific active genes and related to genome organisation) by the viral integrase enzyme. The vector, now called a provirus, remains in the genome and is passed on to the progeny of the cell when it divides. The site of integration is unpredictable, which can pose a problem. The provirus can disturb the function of cellular genes and lead to activation of oncogenes promoting the development of cancer, which raises concerns for possible applications of lentiviruses in gene therapy. However, studies have shown that lentivirus vectors have a lower tendency to <b>integrate</b> <b>in</b> places that potentially cause cancer than gamma-retroviral vectors. More specifically, one study found that lentiviral vectors did not cause either an increase in tumor incidence or an earlier onset of tumors in a mouse strain with a much higher incidence of tumors. Moreover, clinical trials that utilized lentiviral vectors to deliver gene therapy for the treatment of HIV experienced no increase in mutagenic or oncologic events.|$|E

Roth as Jonny, George Segal as Dr. Quest, Robert Patrick as Race, Jesse Douglas as Jessie, Michael Benyaer as Hadji, and veteran voice actor Frank Welker as Dr. Jeremiah Surd. A childhood {{fan of the}} original series, J.D. Roth was inspired by Turner's vision for the new series and swiftly accepted the role of Jonny. Roth was attracted by Jonny's [...] "star quality", and approved of his characterization as a real kid without superpowers. He enjoyed Jonny's infectious enthusiasm and impulsive alacrity. Roth also admired the show's educational quality, something {{he had tried to}} <b>integrate</b> <b>in</b> his personal television pilots. When asked about how he played the relationship with Jonny's father, he commented, [...] "Jonny is crazy about his dad. He looks up to him and thinks he is the smartest man ever to walk to face of the earth. He has the typical teenage relationship with his father, but his father definitely sees something in him. Dr. Quest knows that Jonny is going to be something really special." [...] Michael Benyaer also enjoyed playing Hadji: [...] " [...] {{is one of the few}} roles for an ethnic actor that is not a bad guy. I mean, how many East Indian heroes have been on television? Hadji is for the sensitive kids out there. He is the outsider in all of us." [...] A Star Wars fan, Benyaer was happy to work with Mark Hamill for [...] "In the Realm of the Condor". Peter Lawrence's request for an Indian-descended voice actor was seen as an [...] "unusual case of multi-ethnic casting".|$|E
500|$|The last {{vestiges of}} the Stanley plan were swept aside by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1964. The case {{involved}} the Prince Edward County public school system. [...] Prince Edward County {{was one of the}} Southside counties. In 1951, the NAACP filed suit on behalf of African American children in Prince Edward County demanding racial integration of the public schools. The U.S. Supreme Court consolidated the case, Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, with Brown v. Board of Education, and as part of its ruling in Brown ordered that the Prince Edward County public schools integrate. [...] By 1959, a second lawsuit was working its way through the federal court system in Virginia, and this suit seemed likely to force the county's schools to <b>integrate</b> <b>in</b> time for the 1959-1960 school term. [...] On June 3, 1959, Prince Edward County officials voted to defund and close their public school system. It became the first school system in the nation to close rather than integrate. White parents subsequently contributed funds to establish an all-white private school, the Prince Edward County Free School. Poor African American parents were unable (and unwilling) to establish a similar school, and sued to have the public schools reopened. [...] On January 6, 1964, the U.S. Supreme Court finally agreed to hear their case. The United States Department of Justice, citing the [...] "extraordinary history" [...] of the Prince Edward County case, intervened to support the black parents. On May 25, 1964, the U.S. Supreme unanimously held in Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, that Prince Edward County's school closure violated the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and ordered the public schools reopened immediately. The high court also struck down the tuition grants program, concluding that providing the grants while schools were closed violated the 14th Amendment. On June 1, the Supreme Court agreed to send its order to the district court in Richmond immediately, rather than through normal procedures (which would have delayed action by three weeks). On June 2, the federal district court in Richmond ordered the schools opened. Prince Edward County officials refused to obey the court's orders, and on June 17 the district court threatened to have county officials imprisoned. Prince Edward County officials bowed to the court's authority, and agreed to reopen the county's public schools on June 23, 1964.|$|E

2500|$|In Jämtland {{there are}} also Sami people. The Sami in Jämtland are Southern Sami people and speak Southern Sami (or åarjelsaemien giele, {{as it is known}} in Southern Sami), a {{language}} mutually unintelligible with the other Sami languages. The Sami in Jämtland have historically been referred to as [...] "Lapps" [...] and sometimes by using the vague word [...] "Finns" [...] (supposedly related to English [...] "find", see Fenni), though they prefer to call themselves Sami. There have been Sami peoples in Jämtland from pre-historic times; exactly how many, however, is disputed. The northernmost part of Jämtland, Frostviken, is originally a Sami area, historically referred to as a Finnmark. However, the ancestors to the Sami people who live south of this area today probably did not come to the area before the 16th century, when large-scale reindeer herding began, leading to a nomadic lifestyle among the Sami people. This also led to several conflicts in court between Sami people in Jämtland and the land owners. At the dawn of the 20th century, the Swedish state had an official policy which stated that [...] "Lapp should be Lapp" [...] and that they should all live a [...] "traditional" [...] Sami life and not <b>integrate</b> <b>in</b> the society. This has now changed and only a minority are in fact reindeer-herders. The Sami people in Jämtland are closely connected to their brethren living in Trøndelag, and a distinctive feature of the Southern Sami culture is the yoik called vuoille.|$|E

[...] There was a Democratic majority in Congress for most of Eisenhower's career and Goldwater felt that President Dwight Eisenhower was compromising too much with Democrats in order to get legislation passed. [...] Early on in his career as a senator for Arizona, he criticized the 71.8 billion dollar budget that President Eisenhower sent to Congress, stating [...] "Now, however, I am not so sure. A $71.8 billion budget not only shocks me, but it weakens my faith." [...] Goldwater opposed Eisenhower's pick for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. [...] "The day that Eisenhower appointed Governor Earl Warren of California as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Goldwater did not hesitate to express his misgivings." [...] Goldwater and the Eisenhower Administration supported the integration of schools in the south, but Goldwater felt the states should choose how they wanted to integrate and should not be forced by the federal government. [...] "Goldwater criticized the use of federal troops. He accused the Eisenhower administration of violating the Constitution by assuming powers reserved by the states. While he agreed that under the law, every state should have integrated its schools, each state should <b>integrate</b> <b>in</b> its own way." [...] There were high ranking government officials following Goldwater's critical stance on the Eisenhower Administration, even an Army General.

2500|$|In 1894, George Colby Chase led Bates to {{increased}} national recognition, {{and the college}} graduated {{one of the founding}} members of the Boston Red Sox, Harry Lord. [...] In 1920, the Bates Outing Club was founded {{and is one of the}} oldest collegiate outing clubs in the country, the first at a private college to include both men and women from inception, and one of the few outing clubs that remains entirely student run. The debate society of Bates College, the Brooks Quimby Debate Council, became the first college debate team in the United States to compete internationally, and is the oldest collegiate coeducational debate team in the United States. In February 1920, the debate team defeated Harvard College during the national debate tournament held at Lewiston City Hall. In 1921, the college's debate team participated in the first intercontinental collegiate debate in history against the Oxford Union's debate team at the University of Oxford. Oxford's first debate in the United States was against Bates in Lewiston, Maine, in September 1923. In addition during this time, numerous academic buildings were constructed throughout the 1920s. During 1943, the V-12 Navy College Training Program was introduced at Bates. Bates maintained a considerable female student body and [...] "did not suffer [...] as much as male-only institutions such as Bowdoin and Dartmouth." [...] During the war, a Victory Ship was named the S.S. Bates Victory, after the college. It was during this time that future U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy enrolled along with hundreds of other sailor-students. The rise of social inequality and elitism at Bates is most associated with the 1940s, with an increase in racial and socioeconomic homogeneity. Although Bates was founded as an egalitarian institution, the college began to garner a reputation for predominately educating white students who come from upper-middle-class to affluent backgrounds. In the 1950s the college fenced off the campus in an attempt to [...] "represent boundaries between Bates and Lewiston," [...] to create a [...] "symbolic separation between the purity of the Academia Batesina and underdeveloped city that surrounded them." [...] The New York Times detailed the atmopshere of the college in the 1960s with the following: [...] "the prestigious Bates College — named for Benjamin E. Bates, whose riverfront mill on Canal Street in Lewiston was once Maine’s largest employer — provided an antithesis: a leafy oasis of privilege. In the 1960s, it was really difficult for most Bates students to <b>integrate</b> <b>in</b> the community because most of the people spoke French and lived a hard life." ...|$|E
