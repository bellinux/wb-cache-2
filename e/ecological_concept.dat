50|$|The {{ideas of}} a {{holistic}} community were introduced by plant ecologist Frederic Clements in 1916. These notions were countered by Henry Gleason in 1917, when he proposed the individualistic/open community concept (in applications to plants). Neither of these ecological concepts {{have been found}} to exist in entirety, both are theories which can be applied to communities. For example, a community's composition can be better explained by holism than individualism, or vice versa. This <b>ecological</b> <b>concept</b> is based on the broader concept of holism, which describes the functionality of any system as having many individual parts, all of which are extremely important to the system's viability.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to qualitatively and quantitatively examine how effective nature center preschools are as a teaching tool for early childhood environmental education. This study is significant for generating new knowledge of the <b>ecological</b> <b>concepts</b> young children do and don’t understand, as well as to the future application of designing curriculum and implementing early childhood environmental education programs in the United States. Children are unhealthy, spending less time outside, and are environmentally illiterate (Louv, 2008; Roberts 2 ̆ 6 Foehr, 2008; Driessnack, 2009; Louv, 2009; Coyle, 2005). Exposing children to nature, and implementing environmental education in early childhood programs can solve the growing concerns of today’s youth and develop in an increase in understanding of <b>ecological</b> <b>concepts.</b> The research questions include: 1) Is there a change in knowledge of <b>ecological</b> <b>concepts</b> over a year period? 2) What improvements could nature center preschools make to increase learning of <b>ecological</b> <b>concepts?</b> The research questions were examined by coding interviews completed by children who attend the SANC preschool, summing the frequencies, and interpreting the frequencies using statistical analysis. The statistical analysis of the frequencies of indicators expressed during the fall and spring provides evidence that seven out of the thirteen indicators had a significant increase in expression therefore an increase in knowledge. An improvement that nature center preschools can make is to increase time spent on teaching concepts related to earth systems. Early childhood environmental education provides opportunities for children to develop skills to be environmentally literate, improve physical and mental health, and be exposed to nature...|$|R

Having become convinced that MFME {{would not be able}} to achieve its objective, he left the organisation in June 1993 and co-founded the Mercia Movement, which held its inaugural meeting in Stourbridge on 19 August 1993. The objective of the movement was 'To re-create a legal autonomous Mercia as an organic democracy, based on holistic principles,' and Kent became its co-ordinator. In 1997, the movement published The Mercia Manifesto: A blueprint for the future inspired by the past, a 128-page book, edited and largely written by Kent. He widened his campaign for the environment by releasing his <b>ecological</b> <b>concept</b> album, Only One World, in 2000 and performing songs from it live on a short solo tour.|$|E

The band consisted of main songwriter Kent on lead vocals, keyboards and percussion, Chris Barlow on flute and recorders, Colin Lunn on guitars, John Makoko on bass guitar and vocals and Andy Quin on drums and percussion. The same line-up released the two-part environmental concept album, Tales from the Land of the Afterglow, on Witan Records in 1984. Kent then performed benefit concerts for several environmental and humanitarian organisations. After that, he concentrated on his book writing, making only occasional sojourns into the music world. In 1992, he released his first solo work, Port Vale Forever, {{believed to be the}} first-ever football club album. In 2000, he released his <b>ecological</b> <b>concept</b> album, Only One World, and made rare live appearances to promote it. Both his solo works were released on Witan Records. His musical style has most frequently been described as folk-rock, in a similar vein to Strawbs. From 2008 to 2013, Kent played percussion in the Glorishears of Brummagem morris dance band and claimed to have invented a new technique of playing the drum tambourine, strapped over a shoulder, with a timpani mallet and a drumstick, to create bass drum and rim shot snare drum-type sounds. In 2013, Kent co-founded Mercia Morris, in which he played various pieces of percussion strapped to his body, and he became the side's music co-ordinator. Instrumental pieces of music from Kent's four albums were used to create the soundtrack of the film, Pictures From The Potteries, which was released in 2014.|$|E
50|$|Soundscape ecologists seek to {{investigate}} the structure of soundscapes, explain how they are generated, and study how organisms interrelate acoustically. A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the structure of soundscapes, particularly elements of biophony. For instance, an ecological theory known as the acoustic adaptation hypothesis predicts that acoustic signals of animals are altered in different physical environments {{in order to maximize}} their propagation through the habitat. In addition, acoustic signals from organisms may be under selective pressure to minimize their frequency (pitch) overlap with other auditory features of the environment. This acoustic niche hypothesis is analogous to the classical <b>ecological</b> <b>concept</b> of niche partitioning. It suggests that acoustic signals in the environment should display frequency partitioning as a result of selection acting to maximize the effectiveness of intraspecific communication for different species. Observations of frequency differentiation among insects, birds, and anurans support the acoustic niche hypothesis. Organisms may also partition their vocalization frequencies to avoid overlap with pervasive geophonic sounds. For example, territorial communication in some frog species takes place partially in the high frequency ultrasonic spectrum. This communication method represents an evolutionary adaptation to the frogs' riparian habitat where running water produces constant low frequency sound. Invasive species that introduce new sounds into soundscapes can disrupt acoustic niche partitioning in native communities, a process known as biophonic invasion. Although adaptation to acoustic niches may explain the frequency structure of soundscapes, spatial variation in sound is likely to be generated by environmental gradients in altitude, latitude, or habitat disturbance. These gradients may alter the relative contributions of biophony, geophony, and anthrophony to the soundscape. For example, when compared with unaltered habitats, regions with high levels of urban land-use are likely to have increased levels of anthrophony and decreased physical and organismal sound sources. Soundscapes typically exhibit temporal patterns, with daily and seasonal cycles being particularly prominent. These patterns are often generated by the communities of organisms that contribute to biophony. For example, birds chorus heavily at dawn and dusk while anurans call primarily at night; the timing of these vocalization events may have evolved to minimize temporal overlap with other elements of the soundscape.|$|E

5000|$|The {{roots of}} {{tropical}} ecology {{can be traced}} to the voyages of European naturalists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Men who might be considered early ecologists such as Alexander Von Humboldt, Thomas Belt, Henry Walter Bates, and even Charles Darwin sailed to tropical locations and wrote extensively about the exotic flora and fauna they encountered. While many naturalists were simply drawn to the exotic nature of the tropics, some historians argue that the naturalists conducted their studies on tropical islands in order to increase the likelihood that their work might bring about social and political change. In any case, these early explorations and the subsequent writings that came from them comprise much of the early work of tropical ecology and served to spark further interest in the tropics among other naturalists. Henry Walter Bates, for example, wrote extensively about a species of toucan he encountered while traveling along the Amazon River. Bates discovered that if one toucan called out, the other surrounding toucans would mimic his or her call, and the forest would quickly fill with the sounds of toucans; this was one of the first documented studies of animal mimicry. Alexander Von Humboldt voyaged throughout South America, from Venezuela through the Andes Mountains. There, Humboldt and his associate, Aimé Bonpland, stumbled upon an interesting <b>ecological</b> <b>concept.</b> As the pair traveled from the base of the mountains to the peak, they noticed that the species of plants and animals would change according to which climatic zone they were in relative to their elevation. This simple discovery aided the theorization of the life zone concept, which would eventually give way to the popularization of the concept of ecosystems. Another voyager, William Beebe, researched many species of birds in tropical locations and published a large gamut of academic works on his findings that greatly shaped the field of ornithology. According to his biographer Carol Grant Gould, [...] "The effects William Beebe had on science... are enormous and lasting. He made an effective transition between the Victorian natural historian, content to collect and classify the natural world, and the modern experimental biologist." [...] The work of these early pioneers not only lead to an increased interest in the burgeoning field of tropical ecology, but also had far reaching implications for scientific study on the whole.|$|E
