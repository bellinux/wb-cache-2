40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to explain the performance of <b>equity</b> <b>funds</b> by using three methods, which are risk adjusted return (RAR), risk ratio (RR), and snail trail method. The second objective is to compare <b>equity</b> <b>funds</b> performance towards market performance. The samples of this research are <b>equity</b> <b>funds</b> actively listed in BAPEPAM for period January 2008 until December 2012. The data is taken from each company’s monthly net assets value (NAV) for period January 2008 until December 2012.

The performance analysis of <b>equity</b> <b>funds</b> is calculated by using Risk Adjusted Return with Sharpe Ratio method, Risk Ratio, and Snail Trail. The benchmark is JCI or Jakarta Composite Index for period January 2008 – December 2012. From the three methods used, most of the <b>equity</b> <b>funds</b> are adjusted well and ready to face the risk. In fact, there are still some <b>equity</b> <b>funds</b> with underperform performance compare to the benchmark in both risk and return.
