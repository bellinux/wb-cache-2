40|$|Low <b>glutelin</b> content 1 (Lgc 1) is a {{dominant}} mutation that reduces <b>glutelin</b> content in rice grains. <b>Glutelin</b> {{is a major}} seed storage protein encoded by a multigene family. RNA gel blot and reverse transcriptase–mediated PCR analyses revealed that Lgc 1 acts at the mRNA level in a similarity-dependent manner. In Lgc 1 homozygotes, there is a 3. 5 -kb deletion between two highly similar <b>glutelin</b> genes that forms a tail-to-tail inverted repeat, which might produce a double-stranded RNA molecule, a potent inducer of RNA silencing. The hypothesis that Lgc 1 suppresses <b>glutelin</b> expression via RNA silencing is supported by transgenic analysis using this Lgc 1 candidate region, by reporter gene analysis, and by the detection of small interfering RNAs. In this context, Lgc 1 provides an interesting example of RNA silencing occurring among genes that exhibit various levels of similarity to an RNA-silencing–inducing gene. Possible mechanisms for gene silencing of the <b>glutelin</b> multigene family by Lgc 1 are discussed...|$|R

2500|$|Wheat allergy is {{an allergy}} which {{typically}} presents {{itself as a}} food allergy, but {{can also be a}} contact allergy resulting from occupational exposure to wheat. Like all allergies, wheat allergy involves immunoglobulin E and mast cell response. [...] Typically the allergy is limited to the seed storage proteins of wheat, some reactions are restricted to wheat proteins, while others can react across many varieties of seeds and other plant tissues. Wheat allergy may be a misnomer since there are many allergenic components in wheat, for example serine protease inhibitors, <b>glutelins</b> and prolamins and different responses are often attributed to different proteins. Twenty-seven potential wheat allergens have been successfully identified. The most severe response is exercise/aspirin induced anaphylaxis attributed to one omega gliadin that is a relative of the protein that causes celiac disease. Other more common symptoms include nausea, urticaria, atopy. Gluten sensitivity is not usually classified as a wheat allergy.|$|E

Different malting barley varieties behave differently during malting. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) {{was used to}} characterize storage proteins including albumin, globulin, hordein and <b>glutelin</b> in grains and malt of parental varieties and a doubled haploid (DH) population. Each parental variety produces malt with particular quality profiles. The protein profiles of analyzed extracts in seed and malt were compared {{to find the most}} influenced proteins during the malting process. Our results revealed that malting procedure dramatically affected the composition and amounts of albumin, then hordein, <b>glutelin</b> and globulin in barley. Moreover, hordein and <b>glutelin</b> profiles in the DH population exhibited high levels of polymorphism. The genetic information represented by individual hordein and <b>glutelin</b> profiles was successfully mapped as molecular markers in a genetic linkage map. Twelve and 8 (hordein in seed and malt, respectively) or 10 and 8 (<b>glutelin</b> in seed and malt, respectively) segregating peaks were scored as polymorphic across the population, and all peaks were located to the chromosome 1 H.

40|$|<b>Glutelin</b> is {{the major}} storage protein in rice seeds. It {{represents}} 75 % of the total protein in rice seed endosperm; however, it is low in the amino acids lysine and tryptophan. A genomic clone of the rice <b>glutelin</b> 1 (Gt 1) gene containing a 1. 8 Kb promoter wasmodified to increase coding for additional lysine and tryptophan using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Two separate PCRs were used to amplify a 2. 9 Kb and a 1. 5 Kb segment of the Gt 1 gene, which correspond approximately to the acidic and basic domains of the <b>glutelin</b> protein, respectively. Modification of a 57 -base-pair region was incorporated into this gene by substitution of specific nucleotides in the primers used for the PCRs. Constructs also were prepared for expression of this modified gene in rice plants, both constitutively and in a tissue-specific manner. To enhance the expression level of the modified Gt 1 gene, an additional 3. 3 Kb promoter sequence from the same <b>glutelin</b> gene was added upstream of the 1. 8 Kb Gt 1 promoter to form a 5. 1 Kb Gt 1 promoter. In another construct, the rice actin promoter {{was connected to the}} modified Gt 1 sequence. This construct would enable the modified gene to be expressed in cells of a rice suspension culture. To examine expression of the modified gene in a plant without interference from native rice <b>glutelin</b> genes, a plasmid was constructed using a binary vector pSB 11 to carry a modified <b>glutelin</b> cDNA along with the selectable marker gene, bar, and was transferred into Arabidopsis plants by Agrobacterium infiltration. Transformed plants were selected using Basta and confirmed with DNA hybridization. Expression of rice <b>glutelin</b> was further tested by Western blot and immuno-staining. It was found that both genomic and cDNA copies of the <b>glutelin</b> 1 gene were difficult to maintain in E. coli and Agrobacterium cells, presumably because of “leaky expression” of the cloned gene. Three methods were used to overcome this problem: (1) T-vector cloning. (2) a large scale miniprep screening procedure. (3) incorporation of E. coli lac operon system in constructs. ...|$|R

In order to investigate the functional role of this processing and its effect on folding assembly, wild-type GluA 2 and its mutant cDNA (mGluA 2), in which the conserved processing site (Asn-Gly) at the junction between the acidic and basic chains was replaced with Ala-Ala, were expressed under the control of the endosperm-specific GluB 1 promoter in the mutant rice a 123 line lacking <b>glutelin</b> GluA 1, GluA 2, and GluB 4. The mGluA 2 precursor was synthesized and stably targeted to PB-II without processing in the transgenic rice seeds like the wild-type GluA 2. Notably, the saline-soluble mGluA 2 precursor assembled with the other type of processed <b>glutelin</b> GluB as a trimer in PB-II, although such hetero-assembly with GluB was not detected in the transformant containing the processed GluA. Furthermore, the mGluA 2 precursor in the <b>glutelin</b> fraction was deposited in PB-II by forming a quite different complex from the processed mature GluA 2 products.

40|$|Background Cecropin A is {{a natural}} {{antimicrobial}} peptide that exhibits rapid, potent and long-lasting lytic activity against {{a broad spectrum of}} pathogens, thus having great biotechnological potential. Here, we report a system for producing bioactive cecropin A in rice seeds. Results Transgenic rice plants expressing a codon-optimized synthetic cecropin A gene drived by an endosperm-specific promoter, either the <b>glutelin</b> B 1 or <b>glutelin</b> B 4 promoter, were generated. The signal peptide sequence from either the <b>glutelin</b> B 1 or the <b>glutelin</b> B 4 were N-terminally fused to the coding sequence of the cecropin A. We also studied whether the presence of the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum retention signal at the C-terminal has an effect on cecropin A subcellular localization and accumulation. The transgenic rice plants showed stable transgene integration and inheritance. We show that cecropin A accumulates in protein storage bodies in the rice endosperm, particularly in type II protein bodies, supporting that the <b>glutelin</b> Nterminal signal peptides {{play a crucial role in}} directing the cecropin A to this organelle, independently of being tagged with the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum retention signal. The production of cecropin A in transgenic rice seeds did not affect seed viability or seedling growth. Furthermore, transgenic cecropin A seeds exhibited resistance to infection by fungal and bacterial pathogens (Fusarium verticillioides and Dickeya dadantii, respectively) indicating that the in planta-produced cecropin A is biologically active. Conclusions Rice seeds can sustain bioactive cecropin A production and accumulation in protein bodies. The system might benefit the production of this antimicrobial agent for subsequent applications in crop protection and food preservation. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
