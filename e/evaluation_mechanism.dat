For example, the Costalli et al paper Design Criteria for usable Accessible Web-Accessible Virtual Environments, (2001), looked at usability issues in virtual museums. The issues included long download times due to huge model sizes, extraneous graphics, "unintuituve interaction within the 3 d environment" etc. There are usability problems, (Nielsen, J., 1999, 156), issues of disorientation, (Baker, 2001), and attacks on a perceived sterility of `cyberspace', (Kitchin 1998, Benedikt 1991, Campbell 1996, Johnson 1997, Heim 1997 and Coyne 1997, 1999).

50|$|For LMOOCs {{based upon}} an xMOOC platform, the {{resources}} and tools available for students typically include: textual materials {{in the form of}} Web pages, structured PDF files or URLs to content outside of the platform; audiovisual recordings (often developed and stored on social video sites such as YouTube or Vimeo); activities and exercises (closed multiple-choice tests are the basic <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanism,</b> open answers (based around free writing, which can be compared to model answers or evaluated using peer-to-peer correction); and forums (that represent a key component for students to interact and practice mediated communication in the target language, which provides a valuable mechanism for students to help each other and answers their peers' questions). For LMOOCs based upon the cMOOC model, a range of online Web 2.0 tools can be used to enable students to undertake the remixing, repurposing and co-creation of content and interaction, fomenting the community nature of collaborative and social learning. xMOOC activities are typically highly structured and may not, as such, provide students with the communicative opportunity required to use what has just been seen/heard in an open and flexible way, including fine-grained feedback of different and complementary types. However, conversely, the often unstructured and constantly changing nature of cMOOCs together with, as Brennan (2014) notes, the cognitive load related to the sheer volume of information, number of tweets, posts, etc., available; the varying degrees of difficulty of activities (with little if any guidance available); and the need to use different tools and platforms, etc., can provide additional difficulties to students. Current research attempts to combine the benefits of both types of model.|$|E

40|$|Evaluation {{has been}} {{designed}} and used {{as an instrument of}} organisational governance for publicly funded research institutions (PRIs). Such an instrument can justify external public support and provide internal evidence for decision-making and organisational learning. Under given national and institutional contexts, defined missions of PRIs shape the characteristics of organisational governance in at least three aspects: strategies, funding, and operation. Governance tensions related to them involve key stakeholders at three organisational levels: central decision-making and supervisory bodies at the macro-level (L 1), research institutes at the meso-level (L 2) and individual researchers at the micro-level (L 3). The thesis offers a conceptual framework, built in a formative way, to answer the research question: How do <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of PRIs play a balancing role and help to mitigate tensions in organisational governance? Three PRIs were investigated, namely, the Max Planck Society (MPG) and the Helmholtz Association (HGF) in Germany, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Their governance tensions across the three levels are reflected and balanced by the <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> which facilitate the organisational learning. The balancing processes occur when the individual evaluation activities supplement each other within the institutionalisation of the overarching <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> During the processes, the stakeholders’ interactions and negotiations vis-à-vis their diverging interests are also facilitated. Generalisable balancing roles of <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in organisational governance are found at each organisational level in the three PRIs studied. Specifically, the balance found at L 1 is between external justification of public funding and internal governance of heterogeneous research; at L 2 between required alignment of organisational strategies and individual institutes’ autonomous development; and at L 3 between meeting management instructions and protecting scientists’ trust and freedom. A common principle to mitigate governance tensions across the three levels involving various stakeholders is found—a proper contextualisation of evaluation designs and uses. Implications are suggested for useful ways of discovering and balancing governance tensions at PRIs in general and for public policies on research evaluation in wider landscapes of PRIs...|$|R
40|$|This article aims at {{increasing}} {{understanding of the}} role of R&D (Research and Development) <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanism</b> in mitigating conflicts of governance under the organizational framework of Publicly Funded Research Institutions (PRIs). There has been a series of governance reforms within the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in the past eighteen years. These vigorous reforms over the years have improved significantly CAS’s stability of organizational research landscape and focused governance of complex R&D across varying institutes, disciplines and fields. Dynamics of <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanism,</b> as a key instrument of governance reforms, has experienced four stages from zero, being purely quantitative towards strategic usefulness and categorized principles. Organizational governance of CAS has been learning to be increasingly aggregated from the institutionalization of <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanism</b> and the growing stakeholders’ communication and interactions. The roles of <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanism</b> are for governing complexity and mitigating stakeholders’ tensions in CAS, which perform varyingly at different levels of organizational framework. CAS study offers insights for governance of developing large-scale PRIs under similar organizational framework especially experiencing big reforms. ...|$|E

40|$|Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) is {{becoming}} the reference model for the specification and evaluation of access control policies. In ABAC policies and access requests are {{defined in terms of}} pairs attribute names/values. The applicability of an ABAC policy to a request is determined by matching the attributes in the request with the attributes in the policy. Some languages supporting ABAC, such as PTaCL or XACML 3. 0, take into account the possibility that some attributes values might not be correctly retrieved when the request is evaluated, and use complex decisions, usually describing all possible evaluation outcomes, to account for missing attributes. In this paper, we argue that the problem of missing attributes in ABAC {{can be seen as a}} nondeterministic attribute retrieval process, and we show that the current <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanism</b> in PTaCL or XACML can return a complex decision that does not necessarily match with the actual possible outcomes. This, however, is problematic for the enforcing mechanism, which needs to resolve the complex decision into a conclusive one. We propose a new <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanism,</b> explicitly based on non-deterministic attribute retrieval for a given request. We extend this mechanism to probabilistic attribute retrieval and implement a probabilistic policy <b>evaluation</b> <b>mechanism</b> for PTaCL in PRISM, a probabilistic model-checker...|$|E
