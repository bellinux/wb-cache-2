5|$|Romeo and Juliet is {{sometimes}} {{considered to have}} no unifying theme, save that of young love. Romeo and Juliet have become emblematic of young lovers and doomed love. Since it <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> obvious subject of the play, several scholars have explored the language and historical context behind the romance of the play.|$|E
5|$|The orbital semimajor axis is only 0.13 AU, {{around a}} third of the average {{distance}} between Mercury and the Sun, and is more eccentric than the orbit of any of the major planets of our solar system. Despite this, it is located in the inner regions of the system's habitable zone, since Gliese 876 <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> intrinsically faint star.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} critiques {{of the theory}} from several perspectives. Arguments include that it {{emphasizes}} justice {{to the exclusion of}} other moral values, such as caring; that there <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly post hoc rationalizations (by both decision makers and psychologists studying them) of essentially intuitive decisions.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{fundamental}} group or the higher homotopy groups of a space, homology groups are important topological invariants. Although some (co)homology theories are computable using tools of linear algebra, many other important (co)homology theories, especially singular (co)homology, are not computable directly from their definition for nontrivial spaces. For singular (co)homology, the singular (co)chains and (co)cycles groups are often {{too big to}} handle directly. More subtle and indirect approaches become necessary. The Mayer–Vietoris sequence <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> approach, giving partial information about the (co)homology groups of any space by relating it to the (co)homology groups of two of its subspaces and their intersection.|$|E

25|$|The {{plans are}} {{controversial}} {{because they would}} mean {{the loss of the}} minimalist appearance of the building, the clarity of the layout and public spaces in the building. The closure of Secklow Gate was even proposed, removing the rooftop loading facility that <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> important feature of the building. Additionally, objectors say that the plans to erect dwellings in the central area run the risk of hampering movement around and {{in and out of the}} centre as well as spoiling views of the shopping building.|$|E
25|$|The {{term was}} {{originally}} {{used to refer}} to any person who holds a general power of attorney to represent a principal in all matters. In the common law tradition, anyone who represents the state, especially in criminal prosecutions, <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> attorney. Although a government may designate some official as the permanent attorney general, anyone who comes to represent the state in the same way may, in the past, be referred to as such, even if only for a particular case. Today, however, in most jurisdictions the term is largely reserved as a title of the permanently appointed attorney general of the state, sovereign or other member of the royal family.|$|E

The new republic, which hardly has a population put together better than Rome had to begin with, may perhaps take advantage of Europe some day, {{in the same manner as}} Europe has taken advantage of America for two centuries. No matter what, I cannot help but admire their courage and enthusiastically appreciate their daring.|$|E
25|$|Elliptic curves over finite {{fields are}} notably applied in {{cryptography}} {{and for the}} factorization of large integers. These algorithms often {{make use of the}} group structure on the points of E. Algorithms that are applicable to general groups, for example the group of invertible elements in finite fields, F*q, can thus be applied to the group of points on an elliptic curve. For example, the discrete logarithm <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> algorithm. The interest in this is that choosing an elliptic curve allows for more flexibility than choosing q (and thus the group of units in Fq). Also, the group structure of elliptic curves is generally more complicated.|$|E
25|$|In Scotland {{there is}} no minimum {{residence}} requirement to contract a valid partnership. During the waiting period, the proposed partnership is publicised and anyone may make a formal objection. If there <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> objection, the proposed civil partnership cannot be formed unless the objection is withdrawn or if the registration authority is satisfied that the objection ought not to prevent {{the formation of the}} civil partnership. Provided no objection has been recorded, or any recorded objections have been cleared, the registration authority must issue a civil partnership schedule at the request of either party upon the expiration of the waiting period. The civil partnership must then be registered within twelve months of the notice first being given.|$|E

25|$|Administrative {{controls}} (also called chibai) {{consist of}} approved written policies, procedures, standards and guidelines. Administrative controls form {{the framework for}} running the business and managing people. They inform people on how the business is to be run and how day-to-day operations are to be conducted. Laws and regulations created by government bodies are also a type of administrative control because they inform the business. Some industry sectors have policies, procedures, standards and guidelines that must be followed – the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) required by Visa and MasterCard <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> example. Other examples of administrative controls include the corporate security policy, password policy, hiring policies, and disciplinary policies.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the sixth}} season, Willow struggles to allow herself to perform magic without the {{darkness}} within her taking her over. She {{is no longer}} able to abstain from magic as it <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> integral part of her that doing so will kill her. In the instances when she is highly emotional the darkness comes out. Willow must control that part of her and is occasionally unable to do so, giving her a trait similar to Angel, a cursed vampire who fears losing his soul will turn him evil. In a redemptive turn, when Willow turns all the Potentials into Slayers, she glows and her hair turns white, astonishing Kennedy and prompting her to call Willow a goddess.|$|E
25|$|Park Row, {{historically}} a major artery {{linking the}} Financial District to Chinatown and the Bowery, {{has been closed}} to civilian traffic since 2001. The NYPD asserts that this is necessary to protect its headquarters from a truck bomb attack. Chinatown residents are increasingly frustrated at the disruption caused by {{the closure of the}} thoroughfare, especially nearby residents. People who live nearby argue that the police department has placed a chokehold on an entire neighborhood and that if One Police Plaza <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> obvious terrorist target, perhaps it should be moved from a residential area. Members of the Civic Center Residents Coalition have been fighting the security perimeter around the building for years. Park Row reopened for use only by foot traffic and MTA buses in 2005, and those restrictions remain in place today.|$|E

25|$|The {{elements}} of the historiographies of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Chaitanya Charitamrta and Chaitanya Bhagavata contain main points illustrating the religious bigotry of the Muslims and the consequent persecution of the Hindus, Vaishnavas at the period. Both books retell a famous episode {{in the life of}} Chaitanya. He had introduced the public worship in the form of public kirtana and this enraged the local Muslim ruler. To prevent the recurrences of public kirtana the qazi patrolled the streets of Nadiya with a party. After organizing a large civil march, Chaitanya discussed with quazi the situation, who appears in more chastened mood. Author of Chaitanya Charitamrita attributes the change in the quazi's attitude to a miracle. In Chaitanya Chariamrita however it appears describes an overriding order by a superior of quazi to respect sankirtan Chaitanya, that was issued by the Husain Shah himself, who was impressed with the popularity of the saint. Ishana in chapter 7 of his Advaita-prakasa introduces Haridasa, being originally a Muslim, Haridasa <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> anomalous figure that his presence in the community seems to require explanation. Although Chaitanya himself insisted that anyone who is devoted to Krishna automatically becomes a brahmana, there were only very few non-brahmana, who played a role of leadership in the young group of Gaudiya Vaishnava movement. Ishana uses a reference from Bhagavata Purana (S.Bhag 10.13-14) to support high place of Haridasa in Gaudiya Vaishnavism, and to illustrate spiritual power of his guru, Advaita, to elevate him to such a position.|$|E
