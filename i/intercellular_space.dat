5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little <b>intercellular</b> <b>space.</b> Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E

The existence of the <b>intercellular</b> <b>spaces</b> was examined for 109 wood species. Then the morphological characteristics of the <b>intercellular</b> <b>spaces</b> were observed. The results are as follows; 1. Among all of the wood species examined in this study, the <b>intercellular</b> <b>spaces</b> along the ray were observed. 2.

The morphological characteristics of those longitudinal <b>intercellular</b> <b>spaces</b> were also studied by means of light and scanning electron microscopes. The results are summarized as follows; 1. For all the softwood species examined, about 21 to 77 percent of the intercellular regions formed from a ray and two tracheids had the longitudinal <b>intercellular</b> <b>spaces.</b> 2. From the observation on tangential sections, the longitudinal <b>intercellular</b> <b>spaces</b> were existed {{on both sides of}} the ray. However, they were coincided at the ends of the ray and running into the intercellular regions located among tracheids. 3. The longitudinal and radial <b>intercellular</b> <b>spaces</b> were found to cross each other.

40|$|The {{vigorous}} {{proliferation of}} Ralstonia solanacearum OE 1 - 1 in host <b>intercellular</b> <b>spaces</b> {{after the invasion}} of host plants {{is necessary for the}} virulence of this bacterium. A folate auxotroph, RM, in which a mini-Tn 5 transposon was inserted into pabB encoding para-aminobenzoate synthase component I, lost its ability to vigorously proliferate in <b>intercellular</b> <b>spaces</b> along with its systemic infectivity and virulence after inoculation into roots and infiltration into leaves of tobacco plants. Complementation of RM with the pabB gene allowed the mutant to multiply in <b>intercellular</b> <b>spaces</b> and to cause disease. In tobacco plants that were pretreated with folate, RM was able to vigorously proliferate in the <b>intercellular</b> <b>spaces</b> and cause disease. Interestingly, when it was inoculated through cut stems, the mutant multiplied in the plants and was virulent. Moreover, the mutant multiplied well in stem fluids but not in intercellular fluids, suggesting that the folate concentration within <b>intercellular</b> <b>spaces</b> may be a limiting factor for bacterial proliferation. Therefore, folate biosynthesis contributes to the vigorous proliferation of bacteria in <b>intercellular</b> <b>spaces</b> and leads to systemic infectivity resulting in virulence...|$|R

25|$|Water {{absorption}} at {{the colon}} typically proceeds against a transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient. The standing gradient osmosis is the reabsorption of water against the osmotic gradient in the intestines. Cells occupying the intestinal lining pump sodium ions into the <b>intercellular</b> <b>space,</b> raising the osmolarity of the intercellular fluid. This hypertonic fluid creates an osmotic pressure that drives {{water into the}} lateral intercellular spaces by osmosis via tight junctions and adjacent cells, which then in turn moves across the basement membrane and into the capillaries, while more sodium ions are pumped again into the intercellular fluid. Although water travels down an osmotic gradient in each individual step, overall, water usually travels against the osmotic gradient due to the pumping of sodium ions into the intercellular fluid. This allows the large intestine to absorb water despite the blood in capillaries being hypotonic compared to the fluid within the intestinal lumen.|$|E

40|$|Flooding the <b>intercellular</b> air <b>spaces</b> {{of leaves}} with water {{was shown to}} cause rapid closure of stomata in Tradescantia pallida, Lactuca serriola, Helianthus annuus, and Oenothera caespitosa. The {{response}} occurred when water was injected into the <b>intercellular</b> <b>spaces,</b> vacuum infiltrated into the <b>intercellular</b> <b>spaces,</b> or forced into the <b>intercellular</b> <b>spaces</b> by pressurizing the xylem. Injecting 50 mm KCl or silicone oil into the <b>intercellular</b> <b>spaces</b> also caused stomata to close, but the response was slower than with distilled water. Epidermis-mesophyll grafts for T. pallida were created by placing the epidermis of one leaf onto the exposed mesophyll of another leaf. Stomata in these grafts opened under light but closed rapidly when water was allowed to wick between epidermis and the mesophyll. When epidermis-mesophyll grafts were constructed with a thin hydrophobic filter between the mesophyll and epidermis stomata responded normally to light and CO 2. These data, when taken together, suggest {{that the effect of}} water on stomata is caused partly by dilution of K+ in the guard cell and partly by the existence of a vapor-phase signal that originates in the mesophyll and causes stomata to open in the light...|$|R
25|$|As in {{all forms}} of {{necrotic}} cell death, cells undergoing necroptosis rupture and leak their contents into the <b>intercellular</b> <b>space.</b> Unlike in necrosis, permeabilization of the cell membrane during necroptosis is tightly regulated. While many of these mechanisms and components of the pathway are still being uncovered, the major steps of necroptotic signaling have been outlined in recent years. First, extrinsic stimulus through the TNF receptor by TNFα signals the recruitment of the TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) which in turn recruits RIPK1. In the absence of active Caspase 8, RIPK1 and RIPK3 auto- and transphosphorylate each other, leading {{to the formation of}} a microfilament-like complex called the necrosome. The necrosome then activates the pro-necroptotic protein MLKL via phosphorylation. MLKL actuates the necrosis phenotype by inserting into the bilipid membranes of organelles and plasma membrane leading to expulsion of cellular contents into the extracellular space. The inflammatory rupturing of the cell releases Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) into the extracellular space. Many of these DAMPs remain unidentified, however, the “find me” and “eat me” DAMP signals are known to recruit immune cells to the damaged/infected tissue. Necrotic cells are cleared from the immune system by a mechanism called pinocytosis, or cellular drinking, which is mediated by macropinosomes, a subcellular component of macrophages. This process is in contrast to removal of apoptotic cells by the immune system in which cells are removed via phagocytosis, or cellular eating.|$|E
500|$|Myxobolus cerebralis has a two-host {{life cycle}} {{involving}} a salmonid fish and a tubificid oligochaete. So far, the only worm {{known to be}} susceptible to M. cerebralis infection is Tubifex tubifex, though what scientists currently call T. tubifex {{may in fact be}} more than one species. [...] First, myxospores are ingested by tubificid worms. In the gut lumen of the worm, the spores extrude their polar capsules and attach to the gut epithelium by polar filaments. The shell valves then open along the suture line and the binucleate germ cell penetrates between the intestinal epithelial cells of the worm. This cell multiplies, producing many amoeboid cells by an asexual cell fission process called merogony. As a result of the multiplication process, the <b>intercellular</b> <b>space</b> of the epithelial cells in more than 10 neighbouring worm segments may become infected.|$|E
