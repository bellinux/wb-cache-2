5|$|It {{is unknown}} how {{effective}} the Caesar cipher {{was at the}} time, but {{it is likely to}} have been reasonably secure, not least because most of Caesar's enemies would have been illiterate and others would have assumed that the messages were written in an unknown foreign language. There is no record at that time of any techniques for the solution of simple substitution ciphers. The earliest surviving records date to the 9th century works of Al-Kindi in the Arab world with the discovery of <b>frequency</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E

5|$|Another {{brute force}} {{approach}} is to match up the frequency distribution of the letters. By graphing the frequencies of letters in the ciphertext, and by knowing the expected distribution of those letters in the original language of the plaintext, a human can easily spot {{the value of the}} shift by looking at the displacement of particular features of the graph. This is known as <b>frequency</b> <b>analysis.</b> For example, in the English language the plaintext frequencies of the letters E, T, (usually most frequent), and Q, Z (typically least frequent) are particularly distinctive. Computers can also do this by measuring how well the actual frequency distribution matches up with the expected distribution; for example, the chi-squared statistic can be used.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{concept of}} {{dominant}} frequency (DF) {{has been used}} as a way to express local atrial activation rate during atrial fibrillation (AF). The rotor theory explaining the pathophysiology of AF is widely based upon spatial distribution of DF in the atria. Using <b>frequency</b> domain <b>analysis</b> to represent the rate of atrial activation by DF can avoid some of the limitations of time domain analysis of signals during AF. Understanding the concept of DF is of utmost importance to the proper use and interpretation of <b>frequency</b> domain <b>analysis</b> in AF. The current review focuses on the basic principles and methodology of <b>frequency</b> domain <b>analysis</b> using the Fourier transform during different types of AF. It also provides an update of the published experimental and clinical data on <b>frequency</b> domain <b>analysis</b> in light of the rotor theory for AF maintenance...|$|R

25|$|The {{idea behind}} the Vigenère cipher, like all {{polyalphabetic}} ciphers, is to disguise plaintext letter frequencies, which interferes with a straightforward application of <b>frequency</b> <b>analysis.</b> For instance, if P is the most frequent letter in a ciphertext whose plaintext is in English, one might suspect that P corresponds to E, because E is {{the most frequently used}} letter in English. However, using the Vigenère cipher, E can be enciphered as different ciphertext letters at different points in the message, thus defeating simple <b>frequency</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E

25|$|Ciphertexts {{produced}} by a classical cipher (and some modern ciphers) will reveal statistical information about the plaintext, and that information can often be used to break the cipher. After the discovery of <b>frequency</b> <b>analysis,</b> perhaps by the Arab mathematician and polymath Al-Kindi (also known as Alkindus) in the 9th century, nearly all such ciphers could be broken by an informed attacker. Such classical ciphers still enjoy popularity today, though mostly as puzzles (see cryptogram).

25|$|<b>Frequency</b> <b>analysis</b> {{requires}} only {{a basic understanding}} of the statistics of the plaintext language and some problem solving skills, and, if performed by hand, tolerance for extensive letter bookkeeping. During World War II (WWII), both the British and the Americans recruited codebreakers by placing crossword puzzles in major newspapers and running contests for who could solve them the fastest. Several of the ciphers used by the Axis powers were breakable using <b>frequency</b> <b>analysis,</b> for example, some of the consular ciphers used by the Japanese. Mechanical methods of letter counting and statistical analysis (generally IBM card type machinery) were first used in World War II, possibly by the US Army's SIS. Today, the hard work of letter counting and analysis has been replaced by computer software, which can carry out such analysis in seconds. With modern computing power, classical ciphers are unlikely to provide any real protection for confidential data.|$|E
