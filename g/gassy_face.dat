40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines has {{developed}} an acoustic test for determining if a rock salt sample is from a "normal" nongassy salt face or from a <b>gassy</b> <b>face</b> where an outburst {{has the potential to}} occur. The test is based on the observation that a salt sample taken near an outburst-prone zone produces an audible popping sound when it is dissolved in water. The sound is produced when pressurized gas that is trapped in salt samples is released. In the acoustic test, the sound is electronically measured, digitized, and transmitted to a microcomputer; the output is an average decibel value that classifies the sample as "normal" or "outburst. " The acoustic test procedure and equipment are described, and raw test results and data analysis are shown. Results are also shown for several salt samples that were analyzed using a laser Raman microprobe...|$|E

The {{need to control}} peak methane emissions is particularly stressed. Emphasis is also placed on ventilation principles, monitoring for gas, and reducing frictional ignitions. METHANE EMISSION PEAKS Methane emission from the coal at continuous miner faces varies considerably. Plotted on a chart, methane emissions consist {{of a series of}} peaks and valleys corresponding to the cutting cycle of the mining machine, with the methane concentration spiking as the machine cuts into the coal (Figure 3 - 1) [Kissell et al. 1974]. These methane peaks can be substantial. For this reason, efforts to safely dilute the methane must focus on the level of the [...|$|R
40|$|CFD {{models have}} been {{developed}} to investigate the longwall goaf gas flow patterns under different mining and geological control conditions. The longwall goaf was treated as porous regions and gas flow was modelled as a momentum sink added to the momentum equation. Gas desorption from the caved goaf and destressed coal seams within the mining disturbed area was modelled as additional mass sources in the continuity equation. These CFD models were developed according to specific longwall layouts and calibrated against field monitoring data. Two case studies were presented demonstrating the application of CFD modelling of goaf gas flow characteristics for improved goaf gas capture and the reduction of oxygen ingress into the goaf areas for self-heating prevention. Results from the case studies indicate that the optimum goaf drainage strategy would be a combination of shallow (near the face) and deep holes to improve the overall drainage efficiency and gas purity. For <b>gassy</b> longwall <b>faces</b> retreating against the seam dip, it is recommended to conduct cross-measure roof hole drainage targeting the fractured zones overlying the return corner, rather than high capacity surface goaf drainage deep in the goaf...|$|R
30|$|In 2005, {{during the}} study of safe and high {{efficiency}} mining technologies for high gassy ultra-thick coal seams, the causes of problems that stagnated the production of high <b>gassy</b> LTCC <b>faces</b> were analyzed. In addition, the feasibility of further increasing the coal cutting height was investigated for coal extraction using LTCC technology at ultra-thick coal faces. In 2006, Li et al. (2006) presented some characteristics and potential of designing top-coal caving hydraulic support with large mining heights. In terms of equipment capacities, Lu et al. (2006) conducted a study on {{a complete set of}} mining equipment with a cutting height of 3.5 Â m. Currently, in order to overcome the difficulties in mining high gassy and ultra-thick coal seams, some mining companies in China, such as Tunliu mine and Wangzhuang mine of Luan Group, and Tashan mine of Datong Group, conducted various LTCC mining experiments with large mining heights and studies on the ground control at LTCC faces. Because LTCC mining technology with large mining height is a new coal mining method, however, there is still a lack of related theories and studies; for instance, the applicable conditions for a large mining height LTCC mining operation, the movement of the top coal and the roof strata, stress distribution around the face, and a complete set of equipment for a large mining height LTCC face.|$|R
