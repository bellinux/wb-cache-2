40|$|Data on flood {{occurrence}} {{and flood}} impacts {{for the last}} seven centuries in the northeastern Iberian Peninsula have been analysed in order to characterise long-term trends, anomalous periods and their relationship with different climatic factors such as precipitation, general circulation and solar activity. Catastrophic floods (those that produce complete or partial destruction of infrastructure close to the river, and major damages in the overflowed area, including some zones away from the channels) do not present a statistically significant trend, whereas <b>extraordinary</b> <b>floods</b> (the channel is overflowed and some punctual severe damages can be produced in the infrastructures placed in the rivercourse or near it, but usually damages are slight) have seen a significant rise, especially from 1850 on, and were responsible for the total increase in flooding in the region. This rise can be mainly attributed to small coastal catchments, which have experienced a marked increase in developed land and population, resulting in changes in land use and greater vulnerability. Changes in precipitation alone cannot explain the variation in flood patterns, although a certain increase was shown in late summer-early autumn, when <b>extraordinary</b> <b>floods</b> are most frequently recorded. The relationship between the North Atlantic circulation and floods is not as strong, due to the important role of mesoscale factors in heavy precipitation in the northwest of the Mediterranean region. However, it can explain the variance to some extent, mainly in relation to the catastrophic floods experienced during the autumn. Solar activity has some impact on changes in catastrophic floods, with cycles related to the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) and the Gleissberg solar cycle. In addition, anomalous periods of high flood frequency in autumn generally occurred during periods of increased solar activity. The physical influence of the latter in general circulation patterns, the high troposphere and the stratosphere, has been analysed in order to ascertain its role in causing floods...|$|R

In {{recent years}} the Italian {{scientific}} community has been giving increased attention {{under the auspices of}} the National Research Council (CNR) to the question of natural hazards.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of climate and relief on the Iberian Peninsula favour {{the generation of}} floods. In Spain, these floods have historically had serious socio-economic impacts, with over 1, 525 fatalities {{in the last five}} decades. Floods are the consequence of abnormal weather at a limited spatial-temporal scale and, so far, cannot be simulated with the physical models that predict the different scenarios of future climate change. Possible scenarios of the impact of climate change on flood regimes can be diagnosed through the use of millennial scale relationships of flood response to changes in climate, these obtained from geological and documentary data. In Atlantic basins, the generation, duration and magnitude of floods are very much associated with changes in winter rainfall. Palaeoflood and documentary flood records (e. g. Benito et al., 2003, 2008) show greater frequency of ordinary and extraordinary events during the initial and final phases of cold periods such as the Little Ice Age (1550 - 1850). In the instrumental period (1910 to the present), Atlantic rivers underwent a decline in the frequency of <b>extraordinary</b> <b>floods,</b> although the magnitude of the most catastrophic floods has remained the same, despite the flood control effect of reservoirs. This upward trend of hydrological variability is expected to continue in the forthcoming decades (medium level uncertainty) if we take into account the intensification of the positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). In the case of rivers Duero and Ebro, peak discharges might be affected by the sudden snowmelt resulting from sudden variations in winter and spring temperatures. In Mediterranean basins, past flood series indicate that extreme floods occur during periods of high irregularity of both seasonal and annual rainfall (Barriendos and Rodrigo, 2006), In recent periods (the seventies and eighties) an increase has been observed in intense rainfall episodes, some of which have caused <b>extraordinary</b> <b>floods.</b> These recent floods reached maximum discharges above those recorded in gauging stations {{in the first half of}} the 20 th Century (prior to the construction of reservoirs). In this sense, existing data indicate (high uncertainty level) that the temperature rise could increase the irregularity of the flood and drought regime and cause the generation of flash floods in Mediterranean basins. The areas vulnerable to floods are located close to town centers and tourist resorts (particularly in the Mediterranean). There has been a considerable increase in these vulnerable areas as a consequence of increased exposure resulting from the spread of urban areas, new construction works (e. g. roads, railways, canals) and from human activity close to water courses.

50|$|Originally, Chillán Viejo was the {{location}} of a Spanish fort with the name of San Ildefonso, which was established in 1565, during the campaign of Pedro de Villagra against Loble and the Mapuche north of the Biobío River. Ordered in 1579 to establish a city at the site by Governor Rodrigo de Quiroga, Martin Ruiz de Gamboa founded the city on June 25, 1580 after replacing Quiroga as governor following his death. He gave it the name San Bartolomé de Chillán y Gamboa and populated it with 50 Spaniards and 60 more in the fort. It suffered a number of attacks before it was destroyed by the Mapuche in 1599 after the Disaster of Curalaba. Governor Francisco de Quiñónez immediately repaired it in April 1599. Later, in 1655, the same Mapuche and the neighboring Pehuenches forced the citizens to abandon it again. When it was again reoccupied, it was demolished by an earthquake on March 15, 1657.

This kind of floods is a very common feature in the North-east of Spain and they are recorded every year in some point of Catalonia. This contribution also shows the frequency of those events, {{within the framework of}} all the floods that have occurred in Barcelona since the 14 th century, but also describes the flooded area, urban evolution, impacts and the weather conditions for any of most severe events. The evolution of flood occurrence shows the existence of oscillations in the earlier and later modern age periods that can be attributed to climatic variability, evolution of the perception threshold and changes in vulnerability. A great increase of vulnerability can be assumed for the period 1850 - 1900. The analysis of the time evolution for the Barcelona rainfall series (1854 - 2000) shows that no trend exists, although, due to the changes in urban planning, flash-floods impact has changed over this time.

We studied the fish assemblage structure of 35 connected lakes along a 600 -km section of the Parana River over 5 y. Longitudinal changes in fish assemblage structure were associated with a latitudinal climatic gradient, whereas temporal changes were associated with climatic seasonality and hydrological variability. Longitudinal and seasonal changes in assemblage structure were probably based on different thermal preferences of species that migrate seasonally along the main river axis. <b>Extraordinary</b> <b>floods</b> in summer promoted downstream dispersal of several species, which increased similarity between downstream and upstream regions. Thermal seasonality of this subtropical system was a strong factor driving temporal changes in assemblage structure, {{and the effects of}} the hydrological regime largely depended on flood pulses coincident with periods of warmer temperatures. Fish assemblages varied secondarily along a lateral gradient represented by types of geomorphic units distributed in the floodplain. The geomorphic units generated patchy environmental heterogeneity at the landscape scale that resulted in discontinuous patterns of fish assemblage structure. Assemblage composition was more similar among lakes belonging to similar geomorphic units but situated at geographically distant regions than among lakes belonging to different geomorphic units situated in the same region. Therefore, patterns in fish assemblage variation at regional and landscape scales appear to be determined largely by the dispersal and selection of suitable habitats by fish across the hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales...|$|R

The observations within a given region rescaled by the index flood are then merged with the rescaled <b>extraordinary</b> <b>flood</b> events that have been observed in ungauged basins in the same region. In order to better estimate the return period of these reconstructed flash floods, a sensitivity analysis is conducted using a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approach that allows for a joint analysis of the systematic information from a regular network of streamflow gauges, and extraordinary events either from ungauged sites or historical records on gauged sites. Problems of the assumption of the simple scaling, the extrapolation to the domain of the very small catchment sizes, and the choice of the fitted statistical distribution function are discussed.

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by Asociacion Espanola de Limnologia {{and can be}} found at: [URL] October 2000, the Matarranya River suffered an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>flood</b> with a measured flow rate of approximately 450 m³/s in the town of Vall-de-roures and a return period of about 500 years, according to the Ebro Hydrographic Confederation. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the influence of the consequent perturbation on the structure and composition of the macroinvertebrate community and its subsequent recovery. To this end, two sites in the headwaters of the river, about which information from previous studies was available, were chosen as sampling sites. The Parrissal station, 8 km from the source with a practically natural flow regime, and at Vall-de-roures, 18 km from the source and from which part of the flow has been deviated, to be returned in summer from the waters collected in the reservoir on the Pena River. Sampling was carried out one, five and fifteen months after the flood and the data was compared with that obtained before the perturbation, (December, 1998 and February, 1999). On the other hand, we analized the effects of smaller floods occurring in October 1984 (Parrissal) and June 1986 (Vall-de-roures). The results point to different patterns of recovery in the two sampling points after the 2000 flood, the community density recovering more rapidly in the site less affected by anthropic intervention (Parrissal), while the biological quality of the stretch studied in Vall-de-roures involved increased taxonomic richness and greater structuring of the community. The flood events of lesser magnitude did not seem to affect the community structure in Parrissal, while in Vall-deroures the abundance of the predominant groups varied...|$|E
40|$|Interdisciplinary and {{unconventional}} {{research methods}} offer important insights into geomorphic, hydrologic and hydroclimatologic characteristics of large floods {{that are often}} difficult or impossible to resolve {{in the framework of}} conventional flood analysis. Four detailed studies of modern floods, historical floods, and paleofloods in western and central Arizona demonstrate the benefits of analyzing recent and historical extreme floods within the conceptual framework of paleoflood hydrology and flood hydroclimatology. Analysis of the hydroclimatological and paleohydrological context of extreme flooding in Arizona during the winter of 1993 provides a detailed analog to the likely climatic, meteorologic, and hydrologic conditions associated with the largest events in the regional paleoflood record. Investigation of the distribution of relict high-water evidence from extreme floods on the lower Verde River in 1993 improves the accuracy of the river's paleoflood record and reveals interesting hydrological phenomena of extreme floods in the Verde River Basin. A multidisciplinary study of the extraordinarily large Bronco Creek, Arizona, flood of August 1971, shows the original estimate to be significantly overestimated because of complex flow behavior of an extreme flood and the related dynamic morphological response of a high-gradient alluvial channel. The approach to this study is a template for similar analyses of extreme floods and <b>extraordinary</b> <b>flood</b> discharge estimates. A similar, more comprehensive application of paleoflood research methods is demonstrated by the compilation of a detailed regional chronology of flash-flooding in small desert drainage basins (7 - 70 km²) in western Arizona. The occurrences of large, recent and historical floods were documented with nearly annual resolution, and a 1200 -year regional paleoflood record was compiled. Comparison of these records to conventional regional flood-frequency relations indicates that the regional equations are probably inaccurate because of data limitations. The study presents a viable approach to developing a quantitative assessment of regional flood frequency in areas with no conventional data on real floods. The results of each of these studies extend the spatial and temporal scope of the paleoflood and historical flood record of the lower Colorado River Basin and provide further support for the concept of a regional upper limit to flood peak magnitudes...|$|E
40|$|Study region: The Segre basin (northeastern Spain). Study focus: The Segre basin is {{extensively}} regulated, {{through a}} dense network of dams, {{during the second}} half of the 20 th century. This study assessed the impact of river regulation on the evolution of hydroclimatological extreme events across the basin during the past six decades (1950 – 2013). We assessed whether the occurrence of floods and hydrological droughts has changed, and whether these changes have differed spatially between the headwaters and lower areas of the basin. For this purpose, we employed a set of hydroclimatological indices in order to quantify the evolution of the amount as well as the frequency of quantiles of high precipitation and flood events. Changes in these variables were assessed by means of the nonparametric Mann–Kendall Tau coefficient. New hydrological insights: Results reveal a general reduction in the occurrence of extreme precipitation events in the Segre basin from 1950 to 2013, which corresponded to a general reduction in high flows measured at various gauged stations across the basin. While this study demonstrates spatial differences in the decrease of streamflow between the headwaters and the lower parts of the basin, mainly associated with changes in river regulation, there was no reduction in the frequency of the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>floods.</b> Changes in water management practices in the basin have significantly impacted the frequency, duration, and severity of hydrological droughts downstream of the main dams, as a consequence of the intense water regulation to meet water demands for irrigation and livestock farms. Nonetheless, the hydrological response of the headwaters to these droughts differed markedly from that of the lower areas of the basin...|$|R
40|$|Ephippial egg {{banks are}} {{important}} reservoirs of dormant stages {{that allow the}} recovery of Daphnia populations after unfavourable periods. Although the contribution of hatchlings from ephippia to a population {{in the water column}} is probably of minor importance in permanent water bodies with a year-round Daphnia persistence, this may differ after major disturbances. In 2006, two 500 -year floods hit the long and narrow Vranov Reservoir (Czech Republic), in which we had investigated zooplankton densities and ephippia distribution in the sediment in preceding years. In this study, we evaluated the impact of those <b>extraordinary</b> <b>floods</b> on the population of the Daphnia longispina complex, and particularly on the local dormant egg bank. We considered two alternative hypotheses related to the egg bank: that either the substantial input of new material with the flood completely buried and therefore reset the existing egg bank, or that the sediment including ephippia was redistributed in the reservoir after the flood and dormant eggs could be exposed to hatching stimuli. A year after the floods, we did not observe any sediment layer that would be devoid of ephippia. However, we observed {{a significant increase in the}} proportion of empty ephippia and a decrease in the proportion of those containing eggs. We attribute these changes to disturbance of the sediment due to the floods, which caused redistribution of ephippia stored in the sediment and those detached from the reservoir shoreline. Dormant eggs inside ephippia deposited to shallow parts of reservoir after the floods could therefore receive and respond to hatching stimuli. Hatching from ephippia may have contributed to Daphnia recovery after the spring flood; however, a significant proportion of the Daphnia population probably survived the summer flood protected in the epilimnetic refuge of the thermally stratified environment...|$|R
