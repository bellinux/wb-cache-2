50|$|Dubai {{has become}} the world's third largest diamond trading hub, with trade of rough and cut {{diamonds}} increasing since 2001. The emirate’s diamond trade was virtually nonexistent {{at the beginning of}} the 2000s, but was worth nearly $35 billion in 2013 and 2014. The emirate has been able to leverage off its geographical position between major supplies of mined diamonds in Africa, to the main cutting centres in India and further east in China. There is also a perception of Dubai as a buying hub for consumers of diamonds jewellery, due to the large number of jewellers in the emirate and the tax-free business regime. The diamond trading takes on an exchange managed by the <b>Dubai</b> <b>Multi</b> <b>Commodities</b> Centre, with many of the industry participants housed in office space in the Almas Tower in the JLT business cluster. Facilities there include Kimberley Process Certification offices and access to secure transportation agencies such as Brinks and Transguard, in addition to networking and meeting rooms.|$|R
