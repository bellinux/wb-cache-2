40|$|A new Lightning Protection System (LPS) was {{designed}} and built at Launch Complex 39 B (LC 39 B), at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, which consists of a catenary wire system (at a height of about 181 meters above ground level) supported by three insulators installed atop three towers in a triangular configuration. A total of nine downconductors (each about 250 meters long, on average) {{are connected to the}} catenary wire system. Each of the nine downconductors is connected to a 7. 62 -meter radius circular counterpoise conductor with six equally spaced 6 -meter long vertical grounding rods. Grounding requirements at LC 39 B call for all underground and above ground metallic piping, enclosures, raceways, and cable trays, within 7. 62 meters of the counterpoise, to be bounded to the counterpoise, which results in a complex interconnected grounding system, given the many metallic piping, raceways, and cable trays that run in multiple direction around LC 39 B. The complexity of this grounding system makes the fall of potential method, which uses multiple metallic rods or stakes, unsuitable for measuring the grounding impedances of the downconductors. To calculate the downconductors grounding impedance, an Earth <b>Ground</b> <b>Clamp</b> (a stakeless grounding resistance measuring device) and a LPS Alternative Transient Program (ATP) model are used. The Earth <b>Ground</b> <b>Clamp</b> is used to measure the loop impedance plus the grounding impedance of each downconductor and the ATP model is used to calculate the loop impedance of each downconductor circuit. The grounding impedance of the downconductors is then calculated by subtracting the ATP calculated loop impedances from the Earth <b>Ground</b> <b>Clamp</b> measurements...|$|E
50|$|Correcting {{the problem}} is a simple matter of either {{purchasing}} a copper bonding jumper kit, composed of copper cable at least #6 AWG in diameter and two bronze <b>ground</b> <b>clamps</b> for affixing it the plumbing. See NFPA 70, the U.S. National Electrical Code Handbook (NEC), section on bonding and ground for details on selecting the correct bonding conductor wire size.|$|R
50|$|Clamp {{connections}} are structures {{unique to the}} phylum Basidiomycota. Many fungi from this phylum produce spores in basidiocarps (fruiting bodies, or mushrooms), above <b>ground.</b> Though <b>clamp</b> {{connections are}} exclusive to this phylum, not all species of Basidiomycota possess these structures. As such, the presence or absences of clamp connections has been a tool in categorizing genera and species.|$|R
50|$|A {{crowbar circuit}} is {{distinct}} from a clamp in that, once triggered, it pulls the voltage below the trigger level, usually close to <b>ground.</b> A <b>clamp</b> prevents the voltage from exceeding a preset level. Thus, a crowbar will not automatically return to normal operation when the overvoltage condition is removed; power must be removed entirely to stop its conduction.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{plasma cutting}} process {{involves}} creating an electrical channel of superheated, electrically ionized gas i.e. plasma from the plasma cutter itself, {{through the work}} piece to be cut, thus forming a completed electric circuit back to the plasma cutter via a <b>grounding</b> <b>clamp.</b> This is accomplished by a compressed gas (oxygen, air, inert and others depending on material being cut) which is blown through a focused nozzle at high speed toward the work piece. An electrical arc is then formed within the gas, between an electrode near or integrated into the gas nozzle and the work piece itself. The electrical arc ionizes some of the gas, thereby creating an electrically conductive channel of plasma. As electricity from the cutter torch travels down this plasma it delivers sufficient heat to melt through the work piece. At the same time, much of the high velocity plasma and compressed gas blow the hot molten metal away, thereby separating i.e. cutting through the work piece.|$|R
50|$|Some {{organizations}} additionally consider {{working on}} unearthed de-energised equipment {{to be another}} form of live-line working. This is because the line might become inadvertently charged (e.g. through a back-charged transformer, possibly {{as a result of}} an improperly connected, inadequately isolated emergency generator at a customer facility), or inductively coupled from an adjacent in-service line. To prevent this, the line is first <b>grounded</b> via a <b>clamp</b> known as a bond or drain earth. Once this is in place, further work is not considered to be live-line working.|$|R
5000|$|... "East Gate/West Gate" [...] {{was made}} by Sasson Soffer in 1973. It is a {{three-dimensional}} outdoor sculpture consisting of two spirals welded and bolted together. It is secured to the <b>ground</b> by steel <b>clamps.</b> Four holes were drilled and filled with concrete and then affixed. It is made of stainless steel pipe and is 24' x 40' x 30' in dimension. Installation of this piece occurred on March 22, 2009. It was moved from the Indianapolis Museum of Art and transported via helicopter to its current location on campus {{in front of the}} University Library. It is on loan from the Indianapolis Museum of Art until 2011.|$|R
50|$|During a {{study with}} Richard Walk {{in which they}} looked at the role of the {{environment}} in development of rats, Gibson {{came up with the idea}} of a second task. Gibson wanted to test the depth perception of rats. This led to Gibson and Walk constructing an artificial cliff. This was simply a sheet of plexiglass that was covered by cloth with a checkerboard pattern which was held above the <b>ground</b> with <b>clamps</b> and rods. One side of the cloth was placed just beneath the glass and on the other side the cloth was placed 4 feet below. They then watched what side the rats descended to. To Gibson's amazement the dark-reared rats acted the same way as rats reared in the light and avoided the deep side. Gibson then tested lambs, goats, chickens, dogs, pigs, monkeys and newborn children on a larger apparatus which led to the same results. These tests led to the belief that perception of depth was innate in many species but not all. Kittens that were raised in the dark would walk indiscriminately on both sides of the visual cliff, therefore learning from the environment had to occur.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the workplace hazards generally faced by industrial workers, electricians are also particularly exposed to injury by electricity. An electrician may experience electric shock due to direct contact with energized circuit conductors or due to stray voltage caused by faults in a system. An electric arc exposes eyes and skin to hazardous amounts of heat and light. Faulty switchgear may cause an arc flash incident with a resultant blast. Electricians are trained to work safely and take many measures to minimize the danger of injury. Lockout and tagout procedures are used {{to make sure that}} circuits are proven to be de-energized before work is done. Limits of approach to energized equipment protect against arc flash exposure; specially designed flash-resistant clothing provides additional protection; <b>grounding</b> (earthing) <b>clamps</b> and chains are used on line conductors to provide a visible assurance that a conductor is de-energized. Personal protective equipment provides electrical insulation as well as protection from mechanical impact; gloves have insulating rubber liners, and work boots and hard hats are specially rated to provide protection from shock. If a system cannot be de-energized, insulated tools are used; even high-voltage transmission lines can be repaired while energized, when necessary.|$|R
25|$|On an orbital mission, the Atlas' rocket engines were ignited {{four seconds}} before lift-off. The launch vehicle {{was held to}} the <b>ground</b> by <b>clamps</b> and then {{released}} when sufficient thrust was built up at lift-off (A). After 30 seconds of flight, the point of maximum dynamic pressure against the vehicle was reached, at which the astronaut felt heavy vibrations. After 2 minutes and 10 seconds, the two outboard booster engines shut down and were released with the aft skirt, leaving the center sustainer engine running (B). At this point, the launch escape system was no longer needed, and was separated from the spacecraft by its jettison rocket (C). The space vehicle moved gradually to a horizontal attitude until, {{at an altitude of}} , the sustainer engine shut down and the spacecraft was inserted into orbit (D). This happened after 5 minutes and 10 seconds in a direction pointing east, whereby the spacecraft would gain speed from the rotation of the Earth. Here the spacecraft fired the three posigrade rockets for a second to separate it from the launch vehicle. Just before orbital insertion and sustainer engine cutoff, g-loads peaked at 8 g (6 g for a suborbital flight). In orbit, the spacecraft automatically turned 180°, pointed the retropackage forward and its nose 14.5° downward and kept this attitude {{for the rest of the}} orbital phase of the mission, as it was necessary for communication with the ground.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFlexible Manufacturing Systems (FMSs) {{consist of}} machine tools capable of {{executing}} {{a wide range}} of machining operations relying on the fixtures to reference and block the parts. Hence, the constraints for their flexibility are shifted from the machines to the pallets. An interesting trend in the fixture market are zero-point fixture systems <b>grounding</b> on a <b>clamping</b> system that can hold standard baseplates where the fixture has been previously mounted. This allows a rapid and safe exchange of the baseplates without the need of realignment between the modular fixture and the pallet. In this paper we present an approach for rapid pallet configuration that exploits the additional level of flexibility provided by zero-point fixture systems. Grounding on an ontology-based data model, the description of the production process as a Network Part Program is used to evaluate the impact of rapid pallet configuration at system level and also how these degrees of freedom can be used in the management of the system. The steps of the approach are tested against a real industrial case provided by a company owning an FMS...|$|R
25|$|Rutten found {{a measure}} of {{redemption}} after the upset loss by choking out expert grappler and King of Pancrase Tournament Finalist Manabu Yamada in his next fight, on January 26, 1995. Rutten {{was taken to the}} <b>ground,</b> but he <b>clamped</b> an arm triangle choke from half guard and exerted such a pressure that Yamada, refusing to tap out, was choked out and remained unconscious with his eyes wide open after the hold. Thanks to this performance against the tournament finalist, Rutten received a rematch and a title shot against tournament winner and then current King of Pancrase Ken Shamrock for the King of Pancrase title on March 10. The match was very anticipated, but it ended early when Shamrock executed a kneebar and forced Rutten to submit. According to the Dutch, the loss was due to his training partner Funaki teaching him the wrong way to escape a kneebar, which made Rutten spin in the opposite direction giving a tighter hold for Shamrock. After this failure, Rutten focused on grappling even harder and started training 2 to 3 times a day solely on submissions.|$|R
40|$|The {{quantification}} {{of contact}} area and pressure distribution in a bolted joint is essential information, as it determines {{the integrity of}} the coupling. Current bolted joint design standards are based on analytical solutions of the pressure distribution, which, because of the inherent assumptions, frequently do not accurately represent the real conditions in a joint. This study uses a nonintrusive ultrasonic technique to quantify the contact pressure distribution in a bolted connection. The advantage of this experimental technique is that the effect of actual contact conditions can be determined. An ultrasonic wave is focused onto the clamped interface, and the reflected sound signal recorded. In areas where the contact pressure is high, most of the ultrasound is transmitted, and the reflected sound signal is weak. Whereas, when the contact pressure is low, {{the vast majority of the}} ultrasound is reflected back. A parallel experimental calibration is then used to find the relationship between the reflected sound signal and contact pressure. In this way, the pressure distribution in a clamped interface is determined for a series of different bolt torques. Two different interfaces were investigated: the first consisted of two <b>ground</b> surfaces <b>clamped</b> together, and the second a turned profile pressed against a ground surface. The effect of a washer underneath the bolt head was also considered. The turned profile was found to cause the contact to spread; there was also a certain degree of fragmentation leading to higher peak pressures than in the ground interface case. With a washer positioned under the bolt head for the turned case, the clamping performance of the bolt was improved. Good agreement was found when comparing the ultrasonic measurements with previous studies, with respect to the spread of the contact pressure distribution. However, in this study, the peak contact pressure was found to occur away from the edge of the bolt hole, and to be influenced by the edge of the bolt head...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical EngineeringWilliam KuhnWhen enough charges {{accumulate}} on two objects, the air dielectric {{between them}} breaks down {{to create a}} phenomenon known as electrostatic discharge (ESD). ESD is of great concern in the integrated circuit industry because of the damage it can cause to ICs. The problem will only become worse as process components become smaller. The three main types of ESD experienced by an IC are the human body model (HBM), the charged device model (CDM), and the machine model (MM). HBM ESD has the highest voltage while CDM ESD has the highest bandwidth and current of the three ESD types. Integrated circuits generally include ESD protection circuitry connected to their pads. Pads are {{the connection between the}} IC and the outside world, making them the required location for circuitry designed to route ESD events away from the IC's internal circuitry. The most basic protection pads use diodes connected from I/O to VDD and I/O to <b>ground.</b> A voltage <b>clamp</b> between VDD and ground is also necessary to protect against CDM and MM event types where the device may not yet have a low impedance supply path connected. The purpose of this research is to investigate the performance of ESD circuits and to develop a method for detecting the occurrence of an ESD event in an integrated circuit by utilizing IC fuses. The combination of IC fuses and detection circuitry designed to sense a broken fuse allows the IC to perform a built-in self-test (BIST) for ESD to identify compromised ICs, preventing manufacturers from shipping damaged circuits. Simulations are used to design an optimized protection circuit to complement the proposed ESD detection circuit. Optimization of an ESD pad circuit increases the turn-on speed of its voltage clamps and decreases the series resistance of its protection diodes. These improvements minimize the stress voltage placed on internal circuitry due to an ESD event. An ESD measurement setup is established and used to verify voltage clamp operation. This research also proposes an ESD detection circuit based on IC fuses, which fail during an ESD event. A variety of IC fuses are tested using the ESD measurement setup as well as a TLP setup {{in order to determine the}} time and current needed for them to break. Suitable IC fuses have a resistance less than 5 Ω and consistently break during the first trial...|$|R
