5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E
25|$|It was Hofmann. It was, I think, {{his last}} {{performance}} in Toronto, {{and it was}} a staggering impression. The only thing I can really remember is that, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> brought home in a car, I was in that wonderful state of half-awakeness in which you hear all sorts of incredible sounds going through your mind. They were all orchestral sounds, but I was playing them all, and suddenly I was Hofmann. I was enchanted.|$|E
25|$|A more major {{difference}} was {{the method used}} to produce the split-traces on the displays. Unlike the electronic system used on GL/EL, Mk. II used a mechanical and motorized system that Bedford considered less advanced. The basic idea is to use two antennas that are aimed in slightly different directions, and whose reception patterns overlap in the middle. By comparing the signal strength between the two, the operator could determine if the target was more centred {{on one of the}} antennas, and rotate them until both signals were of equal strength. This system had been widely used in RAF AI and ASV radars even while Mk. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> developed, but they had been put aside in order to get Mk. I into service. Mk. II was, effectively, an effort to adapt these displays to the GL set.|$|E

25|$|Both Heirens and {{his parents}} signed a confession. The parties agreed to a date of July 30 for Heirens to make his {{official}} confession. On that date the defense went to Tuohy's office, where several reporters were assembled to ask Heirens questions and where Tuohy himself made a speech. Heirens appeared bewildered and gave noncommittal answers to reporters' questions, which he years later blamed on Tuohy:It was Tuohy himself. After assembling all the officials, including attorneys and policemen, he began a preamble about how long everyone had waited to get a confession from me, but, at last, the truth {{was going to be}} told. He kept emphasizing the word 'truth' and I asked him if he really wanted the truth. He assured me that he did...Now Tuohy made a big deal about hearing the truth. Now, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> forced to lie to save myself. It made me angry...so I told them the truth, and everyone got very upset.|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{referred}} to commercial pressures behind the basement recordings in a 1969 interview with Rolling Stone: [...] "They weren't demos for myself, they were demos of the songs. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> PUSHED again into {{coming up with}} some songs. You know how those things go." [...] In October 1967, a fourteen-song demo tape was copyrighted and the compositions were registered with Dwarf Music, a publishing company jointly owned by Dylan and Grossman. Acetates and tapes of the songs then circulated among interested recording artists.|$|E

Straight makeups were done in the makeup department by staff, but all the trick stuff and the principal characters were my personal work; nobody else ever touched them. They could not have handled it." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2014, PBS Frontline interviewed Risen and Lichtblau, {{who said}} that the newspaper's plan was to not publish the story at all. [...] "The editors were furious at me", Risen said to the program. [...] "They thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> insubordinate." [...] Risen wrote a book about the mass {{surveillance}} revelations after The New York Times declined the piece's publication, and only released it after Risen told them that he would publish the book. Another reporter told NPR that the newspaper [...] "avoided disaster" [...] by ultimately publishing the story.|$|E

[...] Davis {{said that the}} song's concept deals with his childhood, saying [...] "People think 'Daddy' was written because my father abused me, but that's not what the song's about. When I was a kid, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> abused by someone else. I don't really {{like to talk about}} that song." [...] Some 14 minutes into [...] "Daddy"—well after the song has ended—a hidden track begins to play. The hidden track depicts an {{argument}} between a man and his wife over a Dodge Dart carburetor.|$|E

As she matured into a young woman, O'Hara, like many actresses, became increasingly self-conscious, which affected her for a while. In one performance, which was watched by her father {{from the back of}} the theatre, O'Hara [...] "sensed there was someone out front watching me, perhaps critically. My arms felt like lead.

500|$|Although Spielberg {{was able}} to {{function}} autonomously in Kubrick's absence, {{he said he felt}} [...] "inhibited to honor him", and followed Kubrick's visual schema with as much fidelity as he could, according to author Joseph McBride. Spielberg, who once referred to Kubrick as [...] "the greatest master I ever served", now with production underway, admitted, [...] "I felt like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> coached by a ghost." [...] The film was released in June 2001. It contains a posthumous production credit for Stanley Kubrick at the beginning and the brief dedication [...] "For Stanley Kubrick" [...] at the end. [...] John Williams's score contains many allusions to pieces heard in other Kubrick films.|$|E
500|$|During a {{scene in}} the van, Tom Haverford tells Leslie he changed his name because his {{original}} name was too foreign sounding {{for a career in}} politics. When Leslie points about U.S. President Barack Obama has a foreign-sounding name, Tom gets upset. The reference to Obama's name was originally featured in a scene that was cut from Parks and Recreation pilot episode. Offerman, who barely moves and is often quiet throughout the episode, said he learned to use humor amid silence while serving as an altar boy and lector at his church. Offerman said, [...] "I had a cousin in the congregation, and I would speak with the utmost, august stoicism, and everyone would think I was a very effective speaker. But he knew <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> facetious. He'd get in trouble for cracking up." ...|$|E
500|$|... "A Dog and Pony Show" [...] {{was written}} by James Yoshimura based on a story by {{executive}} producer Tom Fontana, and was directed by Alan Taylor. Barry Levinson, executive producer of , hand-picked Taylor to direct the episode after watching Taylor's 1988 half-hour film, That Burning Question, which Taylor made as a thesis for a seminar taught by film director Martin Scorsese. The episode establishes the vacancy of the homicide unit's second shift commander position, which is offered to Pembleton in the [...] episode, [...] "And the Rockets Dead Glare", before it is ultimately given to Megan Russert {{in the beginning of}} the [...] Taylor said of directing Homicide, [...] "I hadn't even learned the rules of filmmaking, or TV for that matter, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> put in a position where I was supposed to break them all." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the next}} season, Reading {{finished}} 10th and faced strong competition from new signing Elroy Kromheer, but Primus became disillusioned at the financial situation he was in. He was on £1,500 {{a week and}} commented [...] " [...] on twice the wages <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> paid and I had seen the lifestyles they were enjoying". Primus was promised an improved contract, however no such contract was given to him over the summer. By popular demand, manager Tommy Burns was replaced by Alan Pardew. Fitness problems prevented Primus from getting much first team football {{at the start of}} the 1999–2000 season until a change of diet helped him regain stamina. As the season progressed, the club offered Primus a new contract which he dismissed as [...] "derisory" [...] saying the club was [...] "taking advantage of [...] good nature".|$|E

In 2000, he was inducted in Don Garlits' International Drag Racing Hall of Fame. Hill {{was inducted into}} the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2002. After he was notified of his nomination, he said [...] "It's so much more satisfying to get this award now than posthumously. This way I'll be able to enjoy it. Honestly, it was a sobering moment when they called and told me <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> inducted along with some of the people I admired most growing up.

500|$|The HIV storyline {{came to an}} end {{on-screen}} in 2003, when {{executive producer}} Louise Berridge decided to axe Mark Fowler. In the serial, Mark discovers his HIV medication is failing, but instead of allowing Pauline to witness his deterioration, he leaves to spend the remainder of his life travelling. Richard has classed Mark's exit as her most difficult storyline, commenting: [...] "I was so genuinely upset that Todd Carty, who played Mark, was going I could barely get my lines out for want of crying—but everybody said I acted it well. It was, I think, ten per cent acting and 90 per cent me crying my eyes out because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> selfish and didn't want Todd to go." [...] Mark, who had appeared intermittently for 18 years, was eventually killed off-screen in 2004, dying of an AIDS-related illness.|$|E

[...] The BBC's William Gallagher called it [...] "pretty flawless", with The Guardian {{retrospectively}} commending the series. Others, such as Popmatters, have also commented upon how [...] "the show is renowned... for doing something kid television at the time didn't do (and, arguably, still doesn't): it refused to treat its audience like children." [...] Comedian Richard Herring recalls watching the show as a recent graduate, commenting that it [...] "was subtle, sophisticated and much too good for kids." [...] According to Moffat, [...] "Press Gang had gone over very, {{very well in the}} industry and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> touted and romanced all the time." [...] Press Gangs complicated plots and structure would become a hallmark of Moffat's work, such as Joking Apart and Coupling.|$|E
500|$|After {{publishing}} the book, Chang received hate mail, primarily from Japanese ultranationalists, and threatening notes on {{her car and}} also believed her phone was tapped. Her mother said the book [...] "made Iris sad". Suffering from depression, Chang was diagnosed with brief reactive psychosis in August 2004. She began taking medications to stabilize her mood. She wrote: I can never shake my belief that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>being</b> recruited, and later persecuted, by forces more powerful than I could have imagined. Whether it was the CIA or some other organization I will never know. As long as I am alive, these forces will never stop hounding me. Chang committed suicide on November 9, 2004. A memorial service was held in China by Nanking Massacre survivors coinciding with her funeral in Los Altos, California. The Memorial Hall of the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre, a memorial site in Nanjing built to commemorate {{the victims of the}} Nanking Massacre, added a wing dedicated to her in 2005.|$|E
500|$|The band's {{debut album}} {{warranted}} a Parental Advisory label {{because of the}} album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences.

They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really {{like to talk about}} that song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it..." [...] "Kill You" [...] was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his step mother. Follow the Leader marked the first album where the majority of the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like [...] "Justin" [...] and [...] "Pretty" [...] written about incidents occurring during adulthood.|$|E
