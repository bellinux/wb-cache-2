A much larger cab was fitted, and a <b>fuel</b> <b>bunker</b> and water tank behind the cab, supported by a trailing truck. The advantages of the Fairlie design were kept; the swivelling driven truck for a greater ability to negotiate curves, and the large open space between the trucks to fit a large firebox unrestricted by the wheels.|$|E

50|$|The boilers were {{automatically}} controlled, {{and produced}} 110,000 pounds of steam per hour (49,900 kg/h) at 625 psi (4.3 MPa). Fuel {{was moved by}} belt bucket and scraper conveyors to the <b>fuel</b> <b>bunkers,</b> then delivered to the boilers by mechanical spreader stokers.|$|R
500|$|The {{underwater}} {{protection system}} {{was designed to}} withstand a direct hit from a [...] explosive warhead; British aerial torpedoes had smaller warheads than this, though their ship-launched weapons were more powerful. The navy conducted several full-scale underwater explosion tests with sections of armour cut from the old pre-dreadnought [...] The tests revealed that welded steel construction better withstood {{the impact of the}} 250kg warhead than did riveted steel plates. However, the torpedo bulkhead, composed of Wotan Weich (Wotan, soft) steel, placed behind the armoured belt was riveted; this was done because plate joints that had been incorrectly welded would not sufficiently withstand explosive shocks. The underwater protection system was constructed out of several layers: the outer layer that was between 12–66mm (.47–2.6in) thick, directly underneath the main armoured belt, was designed to detonate the torpedo warhead. Behind the outer plate was a large void which would allow gases from the explosion to expand and dissipate. Beyond this was a <b>fuel</b> <b>bunker</b> with an [...] thick outer wall; this would absorb any remaining explosive force. The bunker was supported by longitudinal stiffeners and transverse bulkheads.|$|E

Inward of this compartment, there was a [...] bulkhead, enclosing a void compartment [...] deep, then an oil <b>fuel</b> <b>bunker</b> [...] deep ( [...] less than on Dunkerque), then a [...] bulkhead, containing a void compartment [...] deep, backed by a [...] torpedo bulkhead of special steel. The maximum width was around [...] The reduction of [...] comparing with Dunkerque was necessary to accommodate the boiler room design.|$|E
2500|$|February 15 - The USS Maine explodes. About 274 of the ship's roughly 354 crew die. A {{naval court}} of inquiry led by Captain William T.

50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{heavy fuel oil}} came into more general use and began to replace coal as the fuel of choice in steamships.

2500|$|As {{the convoy}} passed with {{sight of the}} {{lighthouse}} at Cap-Chat, Quebec on 6 September, the convoy entered an area of reduced visibility and came under attack by the , which had been shadowing the convoy. Waiting until after darkness had fallen, the submarine targeted Aeas first launching torpedoes around 23:00. Aeas was positioned at the northernmost merchant position in the convoy in the front row. Two torpedoes stuck the merchant vessel amidships, one in the <b>fuel</b> <b>bunker,</b> {{the other in the}} #3 hold. In response to the torpedo strike, Arrowhead went to full speed and began firing star shells. Truro began searching along the presumed path of the torpedo, finding nothing. Truros asdic malfunctioned the night before the attack and was not fully operational and Q-083s asdic set had failed a few hours before the attack. As Aeas sank, the cold river water poured over the vessel's hot boilers, causing them to explode. Aeas sank in four minutes, roughly [...] northwest of Cap-Chat. Four vessels of the convoy scattered after the explosion, seeking shelter in the shallower waters closer to shore. Truro was nearly hit by the fleeing merchants and was forced to take evasive action. Arrowhead too, retraced the suspected paths of the torpedo. Finding nothing, the corvette dropped four sets of depth charges. However, the German submarine had already moved on. After 40 minutes of searching Arrowhead returned to the site of Aeas sinking and stopped to retrieve survivors. Raccoon screened the corvette during the operation. After 30 minutes spent recovering the remaining crew of the merchant vessel, Arrowhead returned to position at the head of convoy and Raccoon took up position astern of the convoy on the port side. 29 of 31 of [...] Aeas crew were recovered. By 0100 on 7 September, Arrowhead had returned to its position at the head of convoy.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Bunker</b> <b>fuel</b> or <b>bunker</b> crude is {{technically}} {{any type of}} fuel oil used aboard vessels. It gets {{its name from the}} tanks on ships and in ports that it is stored in; {{in the early days of}} steam they were coal bunkers but now they are <b>bunker</b> <b>fuel</b> tanks. The Australian Customs and the Australian Tax Office define a <b>bunker</b> <b>fuel</b> as the fuel that powers the engine of a ship or aircraft. Bunker A is No. 2 <b>fuel</b> oil, <b>bunker</b> B is No. 4 or No. 5 and bunker C is No. 6. Since No. 6 is the most common, [...] "bunker fuel" [...] is often used as a synonym for No. 6. No. 5 fuel oil is also called Navy Special Fuel Oil (NSFO) or just navy special; No. 5 or 6 are also commonly called heavy fuel oil (HFO) or furnace fuel oil (FFO); the high viscosity requires heating, usually by a recirculated low pressure steam system, before the oil can be pumped from a bunker tank. Bunkers are rarely labeled this way in modern maritime practice.|$|R
