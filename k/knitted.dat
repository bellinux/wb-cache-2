50|$|Circular <b>knitting</b> or <b>knitting</b> in {{the round}} {{is a form of}} <b>knitting</b> that creates a {{seamless}} tube. When <b>knitting</b> circularly, the <b>knitting</b> is cast on and the circle of stitches is joined. <b>Knitting</b> is worked in rounds (the equivalent of rows in flat <b>knitting)</b> in a spiral. Originally, circular <b>knitting</b> was done using a set of four or five double-pointed needles. Later, circular needles were invented, which {{can also be used to}} <b>knit</b> {{in the round}}: the circular needle looks like two short <b>knitting</b> needles connected by a cable between them.|$|R

5|$|In the 15th {{century the}} weaving of fine kersies and later serges was {{introduced}} to the area by weavers from the continent. This was largely a cottage industry and merchants would have premises where the fleeces would be combed and sorted. John Lane {{was one of the best}} known local cloth merchants (see Lane's Aisle in the section on St Andrew's church below). In the seventeenth century, Higher and Lower King's Mills were fulling mills for the local industry. In 1816 Mr Upcott employed 60 weavers and 'many spinners'. The Wellington based firm Fox Brothers had a branch factory built in 1890 and made high quality woolen and worsted cloth until 1977. During World War I, their entire output was of khaki cloth, employing over 200 people. In 1910 Mrs Gidley, wife of Dr Gustavus Gidley, set up a hand-weaving enterprise in the stables of Heyford House with the aim of giving employment to ex-servicemen and disabled people. To manage it she appointed two women, one a granddaughter of Bishop Phillpotts. Later the business evolved into machine <b>knitted</b> garments.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to be born with some physical peculiarity, such as a caul, little wings or membranes beneath his armpits, a tail or teeth; or he was born an orphan. There were practices intended to preserve the supernatural power of the newborn dragon. In the region of Veles, Macedonia, twelve girls would pick cotton, spin yarn from it, weave a cloth from the yarn, made a shirt from the cloth, and finally dress the dragon boy in the shirt. As thought in the region of Leskovac, Serbia, such a boy would only then become able to defeat an ala, when three old women spun yarn, <b>knitted</b> a shirt, and dressed the child in it. All this had to be done in one day and one night, during which time the three women should not have spoken a single word. A similar custom was recorded in western Bulgaria, where it was also believed that the soul of the boy, while he slept in his cradle, left his body and walked around. If he was turned, he would die, as his soul could not return into his body.|$|E

50|$|Warp <b>knitting</b> is {{a family}} of <b>knitting</b> methods in which the yarn zigzags {{along the length of}} the fabric, i.e., {{following}} adjacent columns ("wales") of <b>knitting,</b> rather than a single row ("course").

25|$|Like weaving, {{knitting}} is {{a technique}} for producing a two-dimensional fabric made from a one-dimensional yarn or thread. In weaving, threads are always straight, running parallel either lengthwise (warp threads) or crosswise (weft threads). By contrast, the yarn in <b>knitted</b> fabrics follows a meandering path (a course), forming symmetric loops (also called bights) symmetrically {{above and below the}} mean path of the yarn. These meandering loops can be easily stretched in different directions giving knit fabrics much more elasticity than woven fabrics. Depending on the yarn and knitting pattern, <b>knitted</b> garments can stretch as much as 500%. For this reason, knitting was initially developed for garments that must be elastic or stretch in response to the wearer's motions, such as socks and hosiery. For comparison, woven garments stretch mainly along one or other of a related pair of directions that lie roughly diagonally between the warp and the weft, while contracting in the other direction of the pair (stretching and contracting with the bias), and are not very elastic, unless they are woven from stretchable material such as spandex. <b>Knitted</b> garments are often more form-fitting than woven garments, since their elasticity allows them to contour to the body's outline more closely; by contrast, curvature is introduced into most woven garments only with sewn darts, flares, gussets and gores, the seams of which lower the elasticity of the woven fabric still further. Extra curvature can be introduced into <b>knitted</b> garments without seams, as in the heel of a sock; the effect of darts, flares, etc. can be obtained with short rows or by increasing or decreasing the number of stitches. Thread used in weaving is usually much finer than the yarn used in knitting, which can give the <b>knitted</b> fabric more bulk and less drape than a woven fabric.|$|E

25|$|Cable needles are a {{specific}} design, {{and are used}} to create the twisting motif of a <b>knitted</b> cable. They are made in different sizes, which produces cables of different widths.

It functions by holding together the stitches creating the cable as the other needles create the rest of the stitches for the <b>knitted</b> piece. At specific points indicated by the knitting pattern, the cable needle is moved, the stitches on it are worked by the other needles, then the cable needle is turned around to a different position to create the cable twist.|$|E

5000|$|In {{circular}} <b>knitting,</b> the hand-knitter generally <b>knits</b> {{everything from}} one side, usually the right side.

2500|$|A {{few simple}} devices permit <b>knitting</b> without needles for toy or hobby purposes. [...] The {{simplest}} {{of these is}} spool <b>knitting,</b> followed by <b>knitting</b> boards or <b>knitting</b> looms, which consist of two rows of pins mounted in two parallel rows approximately [...] apart. Yarn is wound around the pins; various patterns of winding produce different textured <b>knitting.</b> A needle or special tool is then used to transfer the loops of yarn from around the pins, either off the pins or to other pins, to produce the <b>knitting.</b> <b>Knitting</b> boards can produce complex designs.

50|$|Though <b>knitting</b> {{back and}} forth on rigid {{straight}} needles was the norm, she advocated <b>knitting</b> in the round using flexible circular needles to produce seamless garments and {{to make it easier to}} <b>knit</b> intricate patterns.
