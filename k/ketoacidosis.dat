5|$|Diabetic <b>ketoacidosis</b> may be {{diagnosed}} when {{the combination of}} hyperglycemia (high blood sugars), ketones in the blood or on urinalysis and acidosis are demonstrated. In about 10% of cases the blood sugar is not significantly elevated ("euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis").|$|E
5|$|The main aims in the {{treatment}} of diabetic <b>ketoacidosis</b> are replacing the lost fluids and electrolytes while suppressing the high blood sugars and ketone production with insulin. Admission to an intensive care unit or similar high-dependency area or ward for close observation may be necessary.|$|E
5|$|Diabetic <b>ketoacidosis</b> (DKA) is a {{potentially}} life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. Signs and symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, deep gasping breathing, increased urination, weakness, confusion, and occasionally loss of consciousness. A person's breath may develop a specific smell. Onset of symptoms is usually rapid. In some cases {{people may not}} realize they previously had diabetes.|$|E
5|$|Drugs in the gliflozin class (SGLT2 inhibitors), {{which are}} {{generally}} used for type 2 diabetes, {{have been associated}} with cases of diabetic <b>ketoacidosis</b> where the blood sugars are not significantly elevated ("euglycemic DKA"). This may be because they were being used in people with type 1 diabetes, but in those with type 2 diabetes it may be {{as a result of an}} increase in glucagon levels.|$|E
5|$|<b>Keto{{acidosis}}</b> is {{not always}} the result of diabetes. It may also result from alcohol excess and from starvation; in both states the glucose level is normal or low. Metabolic acidosis may occur in people with diabetes for other reasons, such as poisoning with ethylene glycol or paraldehyde.|$|E
5|$|Appendicitis {{may present}} with vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, {{and a small}} amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic <b>ketoacidosis</b> (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.|$|E
5|$|Rice {{returned}} to the Catholic Church in 1998 after decades of atheism. On December 14, 1998, she fell into a coma, later determined {{to be caused by}} diabetic <b>ketoacidosis</b> (DKA), and nearly died. She was later diagnosed with Diabetes mellitus type 1, and is now insulin-dependent. In 2003, following the recommendation of her husband and shortly after his death, Rice underwent gastric bypass surgery and shed 103 pounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} osmolal gap {{is caused}} by the ethylene glycol itself. As the metabolism of ethylene glycol progresses there will be less ethylene glycol and this will decrease the blood ethylene glycol concentration and the osmolal gap making this test less useful. Additionally, the presence of other alcohols such as ethanol, isopropanol, or methanol or conditions such as alcoholic or diabetic <b>ketoacidosis,</b> lactic acidosis, or kidney failure may also produce an elevated osmolal gap leading to a false diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Diabetic <b>ketoacidosis</b> {{occurs in}} 4.6–8.0 per 1000 people with {{diabetes}} annually. Rates among those with type 1 diabetes are higher with about 4% in United Kingdom developing DKA a year while in Malaysia the condition affects about 25% a year. In the United States, 135,000 hospital admissions occur annually {{as a result of}} DKA, at an estimated cost of $2.4 billion or a quarter to a half the total cost of caring for people with type 1 diabetes. There has been a documented increasing trend to hospital admissions. The risk is increased in those with an ongoing risk factor, such as an eating disorder, and those who cannot afford insulin. About 30% of children with type 1 diabetes receive their diagnosis after an episode of DKA.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} fluid {{replaced}} {{depends on the}} estimated degree of dehydration. If dehydration is so severe as to cause shock (severely decreased blood pressure with insufficient blood supply to the body's organs), or a depressed level of consciousness, rapid infusion of saline (1 liter for adults, 10 ml/kg in repeated doses for children) is recommended to restore circulating volume. Slower rehydration based on calculated water and sodium shortage may be possible if the dehydration is moderate, and again saline is the recommended fluid. Very mild <b>ketoacidosis</b> with no associated vomiting and mild dehydration may be treated with oral rehydration and subcutaneous rather than intravenous insulin under observation for signs of deterioration.|$|E
5|$|The {{first full}} {{description}} of diabetic <b>ketoacidosis</b> {{is attributed to}} Julius Dreschfeld, a German pathologist working in Manchester, United Kingdom. In his description, which he gave in an 1886 lecture at the Royal College of Physicians in London, he drew on reports by Adolph Kussmaul as well as describing the main ketones, acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, and their chemical determination. The condition remained almost universally fatal until the discovery of insulin in the 1920s; by the 1930s, mortality had fallen to 29 percent, and by the 1950s it had become less than 10 percent. The entity of cerebral edema due to DKA was described in 1936 {{by a team of}} doctors from Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{ketogenic}} diet {{alters the}} body's metabolism, it is a first-line therapy {{in children with}} certain congenital metabolic diseases such as pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) deficiency and glucose transporter 1 deficiency syndrome, which prevent the body from using carbohydrates as fuel, leading to a dependency on ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet is beneficial in treating the seizures and some other symptoms in these diseases and is an absolute indication. On the other hand, it is absolutely contraindicated {{in the treatment of}} other diseases such as pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, porphyria and other rare genetic disorders of fat metabolism. A person with a disorder of fatty acid oxidation is unable to metabolise fatty acids, which replace carbohydrates as the major energy source on the diet. On the ketogenic diet, their body would consume its own protein stores for fuel, leading to <b>ketoacidosis,</b> and eventually coma and death.|$|E
5|$|Other {{laboratory}} abnormalities {{may suggest}} poisoning, especially {{the presence of}} a metabolic acidosis, particularly if it is characterized by a large anion gap. Large anion gap acidosis is usually present during the initial stage of poisoning. However, acidosis has a large number of differential diagnosis, including poisoning from methanol, salicylates, iron, isoniazid, paracetamol, theophylline, or from conditions such as uremia or diabetic and alcoholic <b>ketoacidosis.</b> The diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning should be considered in any patient with a severe acidosis. Urine microscopy can reveal needle or envelope-shaped calcium oxalate crystals in the urine which can suggest poisoning; although these crystals may not be present until the late stages of poisoning. Finally, many commercial radiator antifreeze products have fluorescein added to enable radiator leaks to be detected using a Wood's lamp. Following ingestion of antifreeze products containing ethylene glycol and fluorescein, a Wood's lamp may reveal fluorescence of a patient’s mouth area, clothing, vomitus, or urine which can help to diagnose poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Women develop {{long-term}} {{complications of}} alcohol dependence {{more rapidly than}} do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men. Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage and {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to {{have a negative effect on}} reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as anovulation, decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the menstrual cycle, and early menopause. Alcoholic <b>ketoacidosis</b> can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of binge drinking. The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), since women generally have a higher percentage of body fat and therefore a lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men, and because the stomachs of men tend to metabolize alcohol more quickly.|$|E
25|$|Children {{dying from}} {{diabetic}} <b>ketoacidosis</b> {{were kept in}} large wards, often with 50 or more patients in a ward, mostly comatose. Grieving family members were often in attendance, awaiting the (until then, inevitable) death.|$|E
25|$|There is {{elevated}} {{risk for}} developing mucormycosis in diabetic individuals. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes may develop diabetic <b>ketoacidosis.</b> This condition results in an acidic pH which makes serum iron more available, permitting the growth of Mucorales.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, {{the first}} sign of {{diabetes}} noticed by the owner may be that their dog either has become blind (due to the formation of cataracts in the eyes), or has vomiting, anorexia, lethargy and weakness (due to <b>ketoacidosis).</b>|$|E
25|$|Acute {{episodes of}} {{sinusitis}} can also result from fungal invasion. These infections are typically seen {{in patients with}} diabetes or other immune deficiencies (such as AIDS or transplant patients on immunosuppressive anti-rejection medications) and can be life-threatening. In type I diabetics, <b>ketoacidosis</b> {{can be associated with}} sinusitis due to mucormycosis.|$|E
25|$|Insulin is used {{to treat}} a number of {{diseases}} including diabetes and its acute complications such as diabetic <b>ketoacidosis</b> and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic states. It is also used along with glucose to treat high blood potassium levels. Insulin was formerly used in a psychiatric treatment called insulin shock therapy.|$|E
25|$|Exercise is a {{particularly}} potent tool for glucose control in those who have diabetes mellitus. In a situation of elevated blood glucose (hyperglycemia), moderate exercise can induce greater glucose disposal than appearance, thereby decreasing total plasma glucose concentrations. As stated above, the mechanism for this glucose disposal is independent of insulin, which makes it particularly well-suited for people with diabetes. In addition, {{there appears to be}} an increase in sensitivity to insulin for approximately 12–24 hours post-exercise. This is particularly useful for those who have type II diabetes and are producing sufficient insulin but demonstrate peripheral resistance to insulin signaling. However, during extreme hyperglycemic episodes, people with diabetes should avoid exercise due to potential complications associated with <b>ketoacidosis.</b> Exercise could exacerbate <b>ketoacidosis</b> by increasing ketone synthesis in response to increased circulating NEFA's.|$|E
25|$|Although Springer {{had been}} weaned {{from her mother}} {{and was able to}} forage on her own, she was {{underweight}} and in poor health, being malnourished, having <b>ketoacidosis,</b> worms, and an itchy skin condition. Orcas are highly social and form extremely strong family bonds. Resident orcas remain with their mothers and maternal relatives their entire lives.|$|E
25|$|Ketones in {{the urine}} or blood, as {{detected}} by urine strips or a blood ketone testing meter, may indicate the beginning of diabetic <b>ketoacidosis</b> (DKA), a dangerous and often quickly fatal condition caused by high glucose levels (hyperglycemia) and low insulin levels combined with certain other systemic stresses. DKA can be arrested if caught quickly.|$|E
25|$|Nonketotic hyperosmolar {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome) {{is a rare}} but extremely serious complication of untreated canine diabetes, which is a medical emergency. It shares the symptoms of extreme hyperglycemia, dehydration, and lethargy with ketoacidosis; because there is some insulin in the system, the body does not begin to turn to using fat as its energy source {{and there is no}} ketone production. There is not sufficient insulin available to the body for proper uptake of glucose, but there is enough to prevent ketone formation. The problem of dehydration in NHS is more profound than in diabetic <b>ketoacidosis.</b> Seizures and coma are possible. Treatment {{is similar to that of}} <b>ketoacidosis,</b> with the exceptions being that NHS requires that the blood glucose levels and rehydration be normalized at a slower rate than for DKA; cerebral edema is possible if the treatment progresses too rapidly.|$|E
25|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM), {{commonly referred}} to as diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Acute complications can include diabetic <b>ketoacidosis,</b> hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes.|$|E
25|$|This {{most common}} form of {{diabetes}} affects approximately 0.34% of dogs. The condition is treatable and need not shorten the animal's life span or interfere with quality of life. If left untreated, the condition can lead to cataracts, increasing weakness in the legs (neuropathy), malnutrition, <b>ketoacidosis,</b> dehydration, and death. Diabetes mainly affects middle-age and older dogs, but there are juvenile cases. The typical canine diabetes patient is middle-age, female, and overweight at diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|Insulin {{is used as}} a {{medication}} to treat high blood sugar. This includes in diabetes mellitus type 1, diabetes mellitus type 2, gestational diabetes, and complications of diabetes such as diabetic <b>ketoacidosis</b> and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic states. It is also used along with glucose to treat high blood potassium levels. Typically it is given by injection under the skin, but some forms may also be used by injection into a vein or muscle.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} examination is {{the examination of}} the patient for medical signs of disease, which are objective and observable, in contrast to symptoms which are volunteered by the patient and not necessarily objectively observable. The healthcare provider uses the senses of sight, hearing, touch, and sometimes smell (e.g., in infection, uremia, diabetic <b>ketoacidosis).</b> Four actions are the basis of {{physical examination}}: inspection, palpation (feel), percussion (tap to determine resonance characteristics), and auscultation (listen), generally in that order although auscultation occurs prior to percussion and palpation for abdominal assessments.|$|E
25|$|Insulin pumps, cartridges, and {{infusion}} sets may be {{far more}} expensive than syringes used for insulin injection with several insulin pumps costing more than $6,000; necessary supplies can cost over $300. Another disadvantage of insulin pump use is {{a higher risk of}} developing diabetic <b>ketoacidosis</b> if the pump malfunctions. This can happen if the pump battery is discharged, if the insulin is inactivated by heat exposure, if the insulin reservoir runs empty, the tubing becomes loose and insulin leaks rather than being injected, or if the cannula becomes bent or kinked in the body, preventing delivery. Therefore, pump users typically monitor their blood sugars more frequently {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} insulin delivery.|$|E
25|$|In animals, {{diabetes}} is most commonly encountered in dogs and cats. Middle-aged animals are most commonly affected. Female dogs {{are twice as}} likely to be affected as males, while according to some sources, male cats are also more prone than females. In both species, all breeds may be affected, but some small dog breeds are particularly likely to develop diabetes, such as Miniature Poodles. The symptoms may relate to fluid loss and polyuria, but the course may also be insidious. Diabetic animals are more prone to infections. The long-term complications recognized in humans are much rarer in animals. The principles of treatment (weight loss, oral antidiabetics, subcutaneous insulin) and management of emergencies (e.g. <b>ketoacidosis)</b> are similar to those in humans.|$|E
25|$|The term MODY {{dates back}} to 1964, when {{diabetes}} mellitus was considered to have two main forms: juvenile-onset and maturity-onset, which roughly corresponded to {{what we now call}} type 1 and type 2. MODY was originally applied to any child or young adult who had persistent, asymptomatic hyperglycemia without progression to diabetic ketosis or <b>ketoacidosis.</b> In retrospect we can now recognize that this category covered a heterogeneous collection of disorders which included cases of dominantly inherited diabetes (the topic of this article, still called MODY today), as well as cases of what we would now call type 2 diabetes occurring in childhood or adolescence, and a few even rarer types of hyperglycemia (e.g., mitochondrial diabetes or mutant insulin). Many of these patients were treated with sulfonylureas with varying degrees of success.|$|E
25|$|After being ingested, ethanol {{is first}} {{converted}} to acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase {{and then to}} acetic acid by oxidation and egestion process. These reactions also convert nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to its reduced form NADH in a redox reaction. By causing an imbalance of the NAD+/NADH redox system, alcoholic beverages make normal bodily functions more difficult. Consequences of the alcohol induced redox changes {{in the human body}} include increased triglyceride production, increased amino acid catabolism, inhibition of the citric acid cycle, lactic acidosis, <b>ketoacidosis,</b> hyperuricemia, disturbance in cortisol and androgen metabolism and increased fibrogenesis. The metabolism of glucose and insulin are also influenced. However, recent studies showed no significant correlation between hangover severity and the concentrations of various hormones, electrolytes, free fatty acids, triglycerides, lactate, ketone bodies, cortisol, and glucose in blood and urine samples.|$|E
500|$|Diabetic <b>ketoacidosis</b> {{may occur}} in those {{previously}} {{known to have}} diabetes mellitus type 2 or in those who on further investigations {{turn out to have}} features of type 2 diabetes (e.g. obesity, strong family history); this is more common in African, African-American and Hispanic people. Their condition is then labeled [...] "ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes".|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} {{conditions}} {{to be considered}} in the differential diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning. The earliest symptoms, especially from low level exposures, are often non-specific and readily confused with other illnesses, typically flu-like viral syndromes, depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, chest pain, and migraine or other headaches. Carbon monoxide has been called a [...] "great mimicker" [...] due to the presentation of poisoning being diverse and nonspecific. Other conditions included in the differential diagnosis include acute respiratory distress syndrome, altitude sickness, lactic acidosis, diabetic <b>ketoacidosis,</b> meningitis, methemoglobinemia, or opioid or toxic alcohol poisoning.|$|E
500|$|Diabetic <b>ketoacidosis</b> is {{distinguished}} from other diabetic emergencies {{by the presence}} of large amounts of ketones in blood and urine, and marked metabolic acidosis. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS, sometimes labeled [...] "hyperosmolar non-ketotic state" [...] or HONK) is much more common in type 2 diabetes and features increased plasma osmolarity (above 320mosm/kg) due to profound dehydration and concentration of the blood; mild acidosis and ketonemia may occur in this state, but not to the extent observed in DKA. There is a degree of overlap between DKA and HHS, as in DKA the osmolarity may also be increased.|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{research}} studies since the 1950s {{have focused on}} the ideal treatment for diabetic <b>ketoacidosis.</b> A significant proportion of these studies have been conducted at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and Emory University School of Medicine. Treatment options studied have included high- or low-dose intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular (e.g. the [...] "Alberti regime") insulin, phosphate supplementation, need for a loading dose of insulin, and appropriateness of using bicarbonate therapy in moderate DKA. Various questions remain unanswered, such as whether bicarbonate administration in severe DKA makes any real difference to the clinical course, and whether an insulin loading dose is needed in adults.|$|E
500|$|The {{symptoms}} of {{an episode of}} diabetic <b>ketoacidosis</b> usually evolve {{over a period of}} about 24 hours. Predominant symptoms are nausea and vomiting, pronounced thirst, excessive urine production and abdominal pain that may be severe. Those who measure their glucose levels themselves may notice hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels). In severe DKA, breathing becomes labored and of a deep, gasping character (a state referred to as [...] "Kussmaul respiration"). The abdomen may be tender to the point that an acute abdomen may be suspected, such as acute pancreatitis, appendicitis or gastrointestinal perforation. Coffee ground vomiting (vomiting of altered blood) occurs in a minority of people; this tends to originate from erosion of the esophagus. In severe DKA, there may be confusion, lethargy, stupor or even coma (a marked decrease in the level of consciousness).|$|E
