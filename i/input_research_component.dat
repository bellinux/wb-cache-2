The students are very successful in completing the lectured modules, but they are less successful in completing the <b>research</b> <b>component.</b> The main problem is that students complete the lectured component within the required time, but when they start doing the <b>research</b> <b>component</b> they either take longer than the allocated time or they never reach completion [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Exposing {{students}} to research topics enhances their learning experience. It is therefore desirable for instructors {{to include a}} <b>research</b> <b>component</b> into their courses. The courses most prone for incorporating <b>research</b> <b>components</b> are the upper level undergraduate and graduate courses. However, this becomes challenging {{in the case of}} introductory courses, where learning new programming skills is the focus. In this case, the <b>research</b> <b>component</b> needs to satisfy two key conditions: to be easy enough to implement, and to have a fast learning curve. In this paper we describe the introduction of a <b>research</b> <b>component</b> into an introductory web development course (upper undergraduate and lower graduate) for software engineering students. In this context we present a web security research application that is successful at keeping unwanted malicious attacks from happening on web services. It can be implemented using basic web development skills and fast to learn and rationale. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the research problem, the students have been exposed to techniques and research topics in several other fields. The projects outcome including student experiences conducting user studies and human surveys are discussed in the paper...|$|R

The MPA programmes in South Africa are compared with the MPA programmes that are offered in the United States of America (USA). The research shows that not all the South African MPA programmes meet the HEQF’s requirements for a course work master’s degree. Most of the MPA programmes will therefore have to be adapted to meet the requirements of the HEQF. The requirements of the HEQF for a course work master’s degree will give the South African MPA programmes a higher <b>research</b> <b>component</b> than the MPA programmes that are offered in the USA. The implications of this will be that the <b>research</b> <b>component</b> of South African programmes with below average <b>research</b> <b>components</b> will have to be increased...|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} {{much more complex}} to explore {{economic}} growth at a regional level than at a national level due to regional differences, specialization and concentration of certain activities. Therefore, specific economic policy measures and instruments applied in one region will not produce the same effects in another region or at a national level.

40|$|We {{present a}} model of {{sequential}} innovation in which innovators use several <b>research</b> <b>inputs</b> to invent new goods.

We consider not only the effects on the incentives to invent final goods, but also on the incentives to invent <b>research</b> <b>inputs</b> (ex-ante effect). We find increasing complexity has a negative effect on innovation activity in the final goods sector when <b>research</b> <b>inputs</b> are complements. Either limiting market power through weaker patents or reducing the lack of coordination through patent pools may solve this problem.
