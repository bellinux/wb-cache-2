500|$|... "Pathetic" [...] {{is a tale}} of [...] "abject self-pity in {{the face}} of {{collapsed}} relationship." [...] The distinctive riff of [...] "Dammit" [...] was created when Hoppus was forced to skip over the missing two strings on an acoustic guitar. The song's themes include maturity and the refrain, [...] "Well <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> growing up." [...] "Dick Lips" [...] was named after an insult bandied around at Big Fish during recording. It was written about DeLonge's experience when he was kicked out of Poway High School for showing up to a basketball game while intoxicated. [...] "Waggy" [...] was a word Hoppus created while belching, prompting him to name the song with it. [...] "Untitled" [...] is inspired by the emerging ska punk scene, and [...] "Emo" [...] by its namesake, which is partly a tribute to DeLonge's favorite band, Jimmy Eat World.|$|E
500|$|Greatest Hits {{opens with}} [...] "Carousel", {{which was the}} very first song Hoppus and DeLonge wrote {{together}} upon their meeting in August 1992. It {{has been described by}} journalist Joe Shooman as [...] "a satisfyingly fast-assed punk song in the vein of NOFX with some very adept dynamic breakdowns." [...] The band's first promotional single, [...] "M+M's", follows, which is based around power chords and Hoppus' lead vocal of a vacation elsewhere. [...] "Dammit", which was the band's first major-label single and also their first radio hit, is themed around maturity and the refrain, [...] "Well <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> growing up." [...] The distinctive riff of [...] "Dammit" [...] was created when Hoppus was forced to skip over the missing two strings on an acoustic guitar. It reached number 11 on Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1998, and received heavy radio airplay. [...] "Josie" [...] is about [...] "being stoked on a girl." [...] It contains references to the bands Unwritten Law and Dance Hall Crashers ("My girlfriend likes UL and DHC"), two groups the band toured with in the mid-1990s.|$|E
2500|$|Sherlock {{recorded}} {{an album}} between July 11–15, 1994. He played, produced, and mixed everything himself. A person under the pseudonym [...] "Unblack Mark" [...] handled {{the studio and}} recording techniques. As a graphic artist himself, Sherlock created the album's packaging and cover picture. Sherlock marked himself under the pseudonym [...] "Anonymous" [...] in the album's booklet since neither he nor the record company were supposed to reveal his identity. The album was named Hellig Usvart, which is Norwegian for [...] "holy unblack". Sherlock {{said in an interview}} about the name: [...] "I read on the back of an early Dark Throne album, 'Dark Throne play Unholy Black Metal'. Horde was always going to be lyrically the opposite of this, hence: 'Holy Unblack Metal'. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> how the 'unblack' name or title came about. The music sounded like BM, but because of the lyrics and the spirit behind it, it is not BM." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{replied the}} captain meditatively, [...] "you mayn't {{just see the}} way that I view it in, but I'd 'most rather stay here upon this island. I found peace here, peace in believing. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> island <b>is</b> about good enough for John Davis." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} young lady, [...] "I guess {{there was some}} sort of show here anyhow. And no human being ever had a show yet without trying to shut people out of it in order to make them come in. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> covered in all right. A dark hunched old place in a wood. Beech stems, smooth, like pillars. And they came to it at night, in procession, beating drums, and scared half out of their wits. They came in THERE and went round the inner circle with their torches. And so they were shown. The torches were put out and the priests did their mysteries. Until dawn broke. That is how they worked it." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1949, Tulsa posted just a 5-5-1 record, {{but that}} {{included}} {{one of the}} biggest upsets of the season. The Golden Hurricane beat undefeated Villanova, 21-19, a team that had recorded earlier wins over Texas A&M, Penn State, Detroit, and Saint Mary's. After the game, Brothers told the media, [...] "You know, we've had one coming to us for a long time. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> it. We hadn't been doing much and Villanova was bigger, faster and a sound favorite. [...] "But a half dozen of the boys came to me this afternoon. They said they were speaking for the team when they told me: [...] "'We're gonna win this one for you, coach, just to make you coach of the week'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Talk about Greenland's icy mountains, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> bad enough!" [...] cried Chet, as {{he slapped}} {{his hands to}} keep them warm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where's that blamed officer? <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> his job," [...] said one; but the worthy {{mentioned}} drew {{further back}} {{from the edge of}} the group.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on, Em!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Quit {{the eagle}} eye conquest an' take courage. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the same Cowardly Lion Dorothy {{has told us}} about." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Undertow" [...] (While {{the band}} decided {{to pass up}} adding this song to their [...] "A Hangover You Don't Deserve" [...] album, it was {{featured}} on the Summerland soundtrack. Reddick says, [...] "I don't {{have a copy of}} that Summerland soundtrack, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>guessing</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> one of the strongest tracks on it.") ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll go down, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> Phibbs. <b>This</b> may <b>be</b> my {{last day}} on earth, and I'll {{spend an hour}} with my flowers before I bid them good-bye forever." ...|$|R
50|$|According {{to his own}} website, Sayer says... Producer Alan Tarney and I {{were big}} dance music fans, so we {{went back into the}} studio to {{celebrate}} that. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the moment that all my James Brown influences bore fruit, and as always with Alan, we were knocking {{on the door of the}} current computer advances of the time. Now it was becoming scary what just two guys in the studio could do, so we had a lot of fun creating this. The album wasn't a big release, but that took the pressure off, so there’s a lot of wild creative stuff here. “I Can’t Stop” is a disco burner, “Rely On Me” is almost gospel, “Paperback Town” is political and I still don’t know how to describe “Suki’s Missing”, but it’s all very cool.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wall, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> Eden," [...] cried Big Waller, gazing {{around him}} with unfeigned delight. [...] "Leastwise, if it ain't, {{it must be}} the very nixt {{location}} to them there diggins of old Father Adam. Ain't it splendiferous?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mean Cynthy? Well! I {{guess when}} Cynthy can't {{get along with}} the sight of Jeff Durgin, she'll be a {{different}} girl from what she's ever been before. If she's got to see that skunk ag'in, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> about {{the best time to}} do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not as you do," [...] said Old Mother Nature. [...] "In {{very cold}} weather he sleeps, but if {{he happens to be}} living where the weather does not get very cold, he is active all the year around. Now <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> enough about the Squirrel family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't help it," [...] she explained. [...] "I don't {{know whether}} you've had any talk with Mr. Quest, but we've been through some queer times lately. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> death {{business}} <b>is</b> getting on my nerves." ...|$|R
5000|$|Chicago Sun Times critic Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film 1½ stars, disputing the characters' {{longevity}} and comparing the series to the Detroit car manufacturing industry. [...] "Why do they persist in making these retreads? Because 'RoboCop' is a brand name, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> year's new model. It's an old tradition in Detroit {{to take an}} old design and slap on some fresh chrome." ...|$|R
2500|$|On the album’s evolution, Rygg commented, [...] "I {{was pretty}} set on keeping it more bare this time. When we did Blood Inside, we'd been holding {{back with all}} that minimal stuff for so long — the soundtracks (Lyckantropen Themes and Svidd neger), the Silence EPs and all that. So Blood Inside was an {{outburst}} of sorts. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> record <b>is</b> a withdrawal again, so that's an inherent dynamic...flux and reflux." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jake laughed. [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{a pretty}} rash adventure. You won't turn back {{while you can}} see, and there are safer things than running for a shoal you don't know, in the dark. However, there's a point one might get a bearing from abeam and I'll try to fix our position. It might be useful later." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{covered her}} hand {{with both of}} his. The gesture was swift and tender. It seemed to shield and forgive. Then drawing the robe over it without a word, he briskly said, [...] "Well, Jim, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the fork in the road," [...] {{and he looked at}} his chum with misty eyes. Rivers turned away, and they again clasped hands without looking at each other.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never have}} been able to find his home," [...] {{continued}} Peter. [...] "That is one of his secrets. But I know it is in the ground. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> all I know about him. I should say the chief difference between Striped Chipmunk and the Tree Squirrels is that he spends all his time on the ground while the others live largely in the trees." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jodi Walker of Entertainment Weekly [...] "preferred the {{focused and}} speedy pacing" [...] of [...] "Anslo Garrick" [...] more than [...] "Anslo Garrick Conclusion". She {{went on to}} say: [...] "Monday’s episode gave us {{at least a few}} of the answers we’ve been waiting for, re: apple-eating spies and {{paternity}} implications. And then it added, like, 1,000 more questions. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> thing <b>is</b> a marathon, not a sprint; better stay hydrated." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> romance. What {{else would}} you call it now? Me, poor, scared to speak--and Mattie ups and does it for me, bless her. Yes, I've been longing for romance all my life, and I've got it at last. None of your commonplace courtships for me, I always said. Them was my very words. And <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> has <b>been</b> a little {{uncommon}}--I guess it has. Anyhow, I'm uncommon happy. I never felt so romantic before. Get up, my nag, get up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{might have}} known you would ask that," [...] laughed Old Mother Nature. [...] "It is long and slim and has no hair on it. His fur is very coarse and harsh and is brown and gray. He has a close {{relative}} called the Black Rat. But the latter is smaller and has been largely driven {{out of the country}} by his bigger cousin. Now <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> enough about Robber. He is bad, all bad, and hasn't a single friend in all the Great World." ...|$|E
60|$|FRIEND BLISS,--.... Yes, I am {{satisfied}} with {{the way you are}} running the book. You are running it in staving, tip-top, first-class style. I never wander into any corner of the country but I find that an agent has been there before me, and many of that community have read the book. And on an average about ten people a day come and hunt me up to thank me and tell me I'm a benefactor! <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a part of the programme we didn't expect in the first place.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Clive, {{as we have}} said, had now {{begun to}} make acquaintances of his own; and the chimney-glass in his study was {{decorated}} with such a number of cards of invitation, as made his ex-fellow-student of Gandish's, young Moss, when admitted into that sanctum, stare with respectful astonishment. [...] "Lady Bary Rowe at obe," [...] the young Hebrew read out; [...] "Lady Baughton at obe, dadsig! By eyes! what a tip-top swell you're a gettid to be, Newcome! <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{a different sort of}} business to the hops at old Levison's, where you first learned the polka; and where we had to pay a shilling a glass for negus!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Carrie was {{the first}} Stephen King novel to be {{published}} {{and the first to}} be adapted into a feature film. In an interview in Port Charlotte, Florida at a public appearance near his home on the Gulf coast on March 20, 2010, King said he was 26 {{years old at the time}} and was paid just $2,500 for the film rights, but added [...] "I was fortunate to have that happen to my first book." [...] De Palma told Cinefantastique magazine in an interview in 1977: I read the book. It was suggested to me by a writer friend of mine. A writer friend of his, Stephen King, had written it. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> almost two years ago 1975. I liked it a lot and proceeded to call my agent to find out who owned it. I found out that nobody had bought it yet. A lot of studios were considering it, so I called around to some of the people I knew and said it was a terrific book and I'm very interested in doing it. Then nothing happened for, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> six months.|$|R
60|$|I've {{just come}} to my room, Livy darling, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the memorable night of my life. By George, I never was so stirred since I was born. I heard four speeches which I can never forget. One by Emory Storrs, one by Gen. Vilas (O, wasn't it wonderful!) one by Gen. Logan (mighty stirring), one by {{somebody}} whose name escapes me, and one by that splendid old soul, Col. Bob Ingersoll,--oh, {{it was just the}} supremest combination of English words that was ever put together since the world began. My soul, how handsome he looked, as he stood on that table, in the midst of those 500 shouting men, and poured the molten silver from his lips! Lord, what an organ is human speech when it is played by a master! All these speeches may look dull in print, but how the lightning glared around them when they were uttered, and how the crowd roared in response! It was a great night, a memorable night. I am so richly repaid for my journey--and how I did wish with all my whole heart that you were there to be lifted into the very seventh heaven of enthusiasm, as I was. The army songs, the military music, the crashing applause--Lord bless me, it was unspeakable.|$|R
40|$|Firstly, I {{would like}} to expose you to a brief {{scenario}} (Homer 1994) about school and ICT and to some of central terms {{in the area of}} my presentation. The scenario is about children and school, but perhaps you will remember having seen something identical about universities and students. “The future of education lies with X. Why bother forcing our children to spend the most influential years of their lives surrounded by others who would also rather not be at school, when access to everything is possible from their computers? From Leonardo to Newton, from the microbe to the cosmos, everything will be in the reach of a child who has access to this technology. When the only reason left for going to school is sport, the occasional game of footy in the park will be all that is needed {{to put an end to}} this colossal waste of time and money. Here’s to a completely school-free future. ” Is the X Internet? No, not according to <b>this</b> writer. It <b>is</b> CD-ROM. If the text had been written some years later, it would <b>be</b> Internet, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>This</b> <b>was</b> written in 1994. Particularly in the field of higher education, the use of ICT for learning has moved from being a subject for a small minority of early adopters, and decision-makers to a topic of common interest i...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, my dear, you {{are ready}} to help other folks into the same blessed state, and it's your duty to do it!" [...] cried Mrs. Wilkins, her keen eyes full of sympathy and {{commendation}} as they rested on Christie's cheerful, earnest face. [...] "Ef the sperrit moves you to speak, up and do it without no misgivin's. I think it was a special leadin' that night, and I hope you'll foller, for it ain't every one that can make folks laugh and cry with a few plain words that go right to a body's heart and stop there real comfortable and fillin'. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> your next job, my dear, and you'd better ketch hold and give it the right turn; for it's goin' to take time, and women ain't stood alone for so long they'll need a sight of boostin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did once," [...] replied Peter. [...] "I {{happened}} to be over near where he lives when Farmer Brown's boy came along and surprised Digger some distance {{from one of his}} holes. Digger didn't try to get to one of those holes; he simply began to dig. My gracious, how the sand did fly! He was out of sight in the ground before Farmer Brown's boy could get to him. Johnny Chuck is pretty good at digging, but he simply isn't in the same class with Digger the Badger. No one is that I know of, unless it is Miner the Mole. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> all I know about him, excepting that he is a great fighter. Once I saw him whip a dog almost twice his size. I never heard such hissing and snarling and growling. He wouldn't tell me anything about how he lives." ...|$|E
6000|$|Old Mother Nature nodded, and Peter, taking courage, continued. [...] "My {{hind legs}} are stout and strong, but my front ones are rather weak. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> because I {{do not have}} a great deal of use for them, except for running. My coat is a sort of mixture of brown and gray, more brown in summer and more gray in winter. My ears are longer for my size than are those of most animals, but really not very long after all, not nearly as long for my size as my cousin Jumper's are for his size. My tail doesn't amount to much because it is so short that it is hardly worth calling a tail. It is so short I carry it {{straight}} up. It is white like a little bunch of cotton, and I suppose that that is why I am called a Cottontail Rabbit, though I have heard that some folks call me a Gray Rabbit and others a Bush Rabbit. I guess I'm called Bush Rabbit because I like bushy country in which to live." ...|$|E
6000|$|Despite Aunt Bessie's nagging the Kennicotts rarely {{attended}} church. The doctor asserted, [...] "Sure, {{religion is}} a fine influence--got to have it to keep the lower classes in order--fact, it's {{the only thing that}} appeals to a lot of those fellows and makes 'em respect the rights of property. And <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> theology <b>is</b> O.K.; lot of wise old coots figured it all out, and they knew more about it than we do." [...] He believed in the Christian religion, and never thought about it, he believed in the church, and seldom went near it; he was shocked by Carol's lack of faith, and wasn't quite sure what was the nature of the faith that she lacked.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to be troublesome, please the court," [...] {{returned}} the witness, with admirable self-possession; [...] "but law is law, all over the world, and <b>I</b> rather <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> question <b>is</b> ag'in it. In the Granite State, it is always held, when a thing can be proved by the person who said any particular words, that the question must be put to him, and not to a bystander." ...|$|R
50|$|Signal {{deals with}} ephemeral and spiritual themes. Furukawa says, “each song is a {{different}} type of ceremonial goodbye song. I lost my Japanese grandmother while I <b>was</b> working on <b>this</b> album, and went through some enormous life transitions with relationships and work and travel. Like the snow falling gracefully to make everything perfect for a day, many things in our lives <b>are</b> transitory. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>this</b> album <b>was</b> really coming to grips with that and trying to find the beauty and meaning in it.” Furukawa has also composed a bilingual children’s album, “The Adventures of Chibi Neko Chan.” A limited release of some of the songs have been used for charity programs. It will officially be released through her website in the future.|$|R
