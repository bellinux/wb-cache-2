5|$|While {{historically}} {{thought of}} as simple leathery structures composed of skin, research has since shown that the wing membranes of pterosaurs were highly complex dynamic structures suited to an active style of flight. The outer wings (from the tip to the elbow) were strengthened by closely spaced fibers called actinofibrils. The actinofibrils themselves consisted of three distinct layers in the wing, forming a crisscross pattern when superimposed on one another. The function of the actinofibrils is unknown, as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> material from which they were made. Depending on their exact composition (keratin, muscle, elastic structures, etc.), {{they may have been}} stiffening or strengthening agents in the outer part of the wing. The wing membranes also contained a thin layer of muscle, fibrous tissue, and a unique, complex circulatory system of looping blood vessels.|$|E

It was later supplemented by two others which are the Red Crescent, and the Red Crystal. The Red Crescent was adopted by the Ottoman Empire during the Russo-Turkish war and the Red Crystal by the governments in 2005, as an additional emblem devoid of any national, political or religious connotation.|$|E

25|$|This chapel is {{different}} from the others: it is classical in structure and combines geometric architectural elements, a type of decoration reflecting contemporary taste and employing elements of the “National Style.” The type of gilt woodwork – gold elements on a white background – is unique in the decoration of the church. The altar piece was completed in 1707, replacing an earlier one which had fallen into disrepair. The central niche houses a statue in upholstered wood of St. Roch which, according to tradition, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> height of the saint (140cm). The altar piece also includes sculptures of St. James and St. Sebastian, as well as six statuettes in silvered woods of the four Evangelists and Saints Peter and Paul.|$|E
25|$|There are oxygen sensors in {{the smaller}} bronchi and bronchioles. In {{response}} to low partial pressures of oxygen in the inhaled air these sensors reflexly cause the pulmonary arterioles to constrict. (This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> opposite of the corresponding reflex in the tissues, where low arterial partial pressures of O2 cause arteriolar vasodilation.) At altitude this causes the pulmonary arterial pressure to rise resulting {{in a much more}} even distribution of blood flow to the lungs than occurs at sea level. At sea level the pulmonary arterial pressure is very low, with the result that the tops of the lungs receive far less blood than the bases, which are relatively over-perfused with blood. It is only in middle of the lungs that the blood and air flow to the alveoli are ideally matched. At altitude this variation in the ventilation/perfusion ratio of alveoli from the tops of the lungs to the bottoms is eliminated, with all the alveoli perfused and ventilated in more or less the physiologically ideal manner. This is a further important contributor to the acclimatatization to high altitudes and low oxygen pressures.|$|E

500|$|Kamal Haasan's character, Arun, is {{an early}} version of a {{metrosexual}} male [...] sensitive and sincere. Rajinikanth's character, Thyagu, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> opposite of Arun [...] money-minded, arrogant, and a womaniser. This is evident when Thyagu says to Arun: [...] "Women should be enjoyed, not analysed." [...] According to Rajinikanth, Thyagu was very much similar to him in real life— he too smokes and drinks, but applies vibhuti (sacred ash) on his forehead. This implies that Thyagu was also an atheist. According to film critic Naman Ramachandran, Thyagu was, by far, Rajinikanth's most entertaining character up to that point in his career; his character was a self-confessed chauvinist who believed that men and women can never be equal, and that women are merely objects to be used for men's pleasure. When Arun calls Thyagu [...] "a prejudiced ass", Thyagu responds by saying, [...] "I am a male ass," [...] with the dialogue being in English. His opinion of Sripriya's character, Manju, is seen when he says (also in English), [...] "She is a self pitying sex-starved bitch!" ...|$|E

500|$|By 2009, {{there had}} been four {{versions}} of the album released: a rare London Records promotional disc, a bootleg with cover art by Arik Roper, the Rise Above/Music Cartel Records album, and a release by Tee Pee Records. The Rise Above/Music Cartel release was an unauthorized edited version, released in 1999 under the title Jerusalem. Jerusalem runs at 52 minutes and is a single composition split into six identically named tracks. The version of the album titled Dopesmoker was released on April 22, 2003, by Tee Pee Records on compact disc and vinyl with a 63-minute running time. Cisneros spoke most positively about the 2003 Dopesmoker release, saying [...] "I don't think the Dopesmoker thing <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> version that we submitted, but that's the closest one that's {{come out of the}} four. If I had to pick a favorite, that would be it." [...] Parts of the song were used in the film Broken Flowers by Jim Jarmusch. Jarmusch stated that he was a fan of Sleep and listed them along with Earth and Sunn O))) as an influence for creating the film: [...] "I love these kind of visual landscapes they make, and they really inspired things for me for my film The Limits of Control".|$|E
