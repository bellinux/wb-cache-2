40|$|Many owl species use {{the same}} nesting and food resources, which causes strong {{interspecific}} competition and spatio-temporal niche separation. We made use of a recent colonisation of Ural Owls (Strix uralensis) in southern Poland to compare habitat preferences of <b>Tawny</b> <b>Owls</b> (Strix aluco) allopatry and sympatry with Ural Owls. We investigated spatial niche segregation of Ural <b>Owl</b> and the <b>Tawny</b> <b>Owl</b> in sympatry and compared habitat preferences of <b>Tawny</b> <b>Owls</b> breeding in allopatry and sympatry. <b>Tawny</b> <b>Owls</b> breeding in sympatry with Ural Owls occupied forests with higher canopy compactness, sites located closer to forest border and to built-up areas, as well as stands with a higher share of fir and spruce and a lower share of beech as compared to sites occupied by Ural <b>Owls.</b> Allopatric <b>Tawny</b> <b>Owls</b> occupied sites with lower canopy compactness and bred at sites located further from forest borders and in stands with lower share of fir and spruce and a higher share of deciduous as compared to sympatric <b>Tawny</b> <b>Owls.</b> As Ural owls are dominant in relation to <b>Tawny</b> <b>Owls,</b> this indicates {{that the presence of}} Ural <b>Owls</b> prevents <b>Tawny</b> <b>Owls</b> from occupying deciduous-dominated and old stands located in forest interior areas, far from buildings and forest edges. The results support habitat displacement between the two species when breeding in sympatry. We also show that protection of large forest patches is crucial for the Ural Owl, a species still rare in central Europe, while small patches are occupied by the abundant <b>Tawny</b> <b>Owl...</b>|$|R
50|$|The desert <b>owl</b> or desert <b>tawny</b> <b>owl</b> (Strix hadorami), {{formerly}} known as Hume's owl, is a species of owl. It {{is closely related to}} the more widespread <b>tawny</b> <b>owl</b> and to the range-restricted Omani owl.|$|R
5|$|Less {{powerful}} woodland owls such as {{the little}} owl and the long-eared owl cannot usually co-exist with the stronger <b>tawny</b> <b>owls,</b> which may take them as food items, and are found in different habitats; in Ireland {{the absence of the}} <b>tawny</b> <b>owl</b> allowed the long-eared owl to become the dominant owl.

5|$|The <b>tawny</b> <b>owl</b> is {{a member}} of the wood-owl genus Strix, part of the typical owl family Strigidae, which {{contains}} all species of owl other than the barn owls.

40|$|Secondary {{exposure}} of vertebrate predators to second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs) is widespread in Britain. <b>Tawny</b> <b>owl</b> (Strix aluco) {{populations in the}} UK have declined since the 1970 s, when SGARs were first introduced, and these compounds {{may have contributed to}} the decline in owl numbers. Our aims were to conduct the first systematic survey of SGAR exposure in <b>tawny</b> <b>owls</b> and ascertain whether there had been a change in the proportion of exposed birds that was concurrent with the decline in the population. Liver difenacoum, bromadiolone, flocoumafen and brodifacoum concentrations in British <b>tawny</b> <b>owls</b> from two periods (1990 - 1993 and 2003 - 2005) were quantified. In total, some 20 % of birds contained detectable residues of one or more SGAR. The extent of exposure (% of birds exposed, magnitude of residues) to different SGARs did not change consistently between time periods. Of the raptors analysed to date in Britain, <b>tawny</b> <b>owls</b> had the lowest proportion of individuals that contained detectable liver residues and so appear to be the least vulnerable to exposure and/or assimilation of SGARs.

40|$|Eight {{subspecies}} {{have been}} proposed within the <b>Tawny</b> <b>Owl</b> (Strix aluco) species. However, recent molecular data have challenged this view, encouraging further work in this species complex. Here we reevaluated the taxonomic status between the North-Western African <b>Tawny</b> <b>Owl,</b> <b>S.</b> a. mauritanica, and its closest Iberian <b>Tawny</b> <b>Owl</b> population (from the S. a. sylvatica to S. a. aluco clade) separated by the Strait of Gibraltar. The <b>Tawny</b> <b>Owl</b> is a non-migratory and territorial species, and juvenile dispersal is restricted to a few kilometers around the natal site. This limited dispersal and the barrier imposed by the Strait of Gibraltar predicted a strong differentiation between the two populations. We tested this using DNA barcoding, Bayesian phylogenetic and species delimitation analysis. We found that an 81. 1 % of variation {{is due to the}} intergroups variation. In addition, the inter-intraspecific distances distribution revealed a barcoding gap among the two subspecies. Also, posterior probabilities and the PAB value allowed to reject the hypothesis that observed degree of distinctiveness is due to random coalescence processes. These findings clearly support the Strait of Gibraltar as an isolating barrier for this species. The subspecific status is confirmed and species status is even suggested for S. a. mauritanica.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{road networks}} threaten ecosystems by direct effects such as increased mortality due to collision with vehicles and by various indirect effects leading to road avoidance. We censused <b>Tawny</b> <b>Owls</b> Strix aluco and Little Owls Athene noctua in 2005, 2007 and 2009 {{in a rural}} landscape in Southern Portugal in order to {{study the effects of}} roads and habitat characteristics on <b>Tawny</b> <b>Owl</b> density and Little Owl presence. The presence of both owl species in the 70 census locations was coherent among years. Our results showed that <b>Tawny</b> <b>Owl</b> density near major roads was lower, with the negative effects extending possibly up to 2 km. The probability of Little Owl presence was also negatively affected by the proximity to major roads. The negative effects of roads were significant even considering habitat preferences and spatial autocorrelation, which had the most marked effect on the density or presence of both owls. The reduced occupancy by <b>Tawny</b> <b>Owls</b> and Little Owls of habitats near major roads may be caused by several factors, including increased mortality, disturbance caused by high traffic density, and increased fragmentation. Traffic noise in particular may affect intra-specific communication and hunting efficiency. Consequently, habitat near roads may represent lower-quality territories for owls...|$|R

40|$|Background: Despite its {{importance}} for reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions, {{there is still}} incomplete understanding of factors responsible for high road mortality. In particular, few empirical studies examined the idea that spatial variation in roadkills is influenced by a complex interplay between road-related factors, and species-specific habitat quality and landscape connectivity. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study we addressed this issue, using a 7 -year dataset of <b>tawny</b> <b>owl</b> (Strix aluco) roadkills recorded along 37 km of road in southern Portugal. We used a multi-species roadkill index as a surrogate of intrinsic road risk, and we used a Maxent distribution model to estimate habitat suitability. Landscape connectivity was estimated from least-cost paths between <b>tawny</b> <b>owl</b> territories, using habitat suitability as a resistance surface. We defined 10 alternative scenarios to compute connectivity, based on variation in potential movement patterns according to territory quality and dispersal distance thresholds. Hierarchical partitioning of a regression model indicated that independent variation in <b>tawny</b> <b>owl</b> roadkills was explained primarily by the roadkill index (70. 5 %) and, to a much lesser extent, by landscape connectivity (26. 2 %), while habitat suitability had minor effects (3. 3 %). Analysis of connectivity scenarios suggested that owl roadkills were primarily related to short range movements (, 5 km) between high quality territories. <b>Tawny</b> <b>owl</b> roadkills were spatially autocorrelated, but the introduction of spatial filters in the regression model did no...|$|R
