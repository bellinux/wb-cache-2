40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the level of {{population}} longevity and the characteristics of four geographic areas where unusually high proportions of longlived individuals have been observed. For these areas (Ogliastra in Sardinia, Okinawa in Japan, the Nicoya peninsula in Costa Rica and the island of Ikaria in Greece). The term of ‘blue zone’ (BZ) given to these areas is defined as a limited region where the population shares a common lifestyle and environment and whose exceptional longevity has been accurately verified. This paper discusses the use of different indexes to measure the longevity of a population. As a preliminary result of our investigations we confirm the exceptional level of male longevity in the Sardinian BZ and both male and female longevity in Okinawa. Considering possible explanations, we observed that BZ populations are geographically and/or historically isolated (islands and mountainous regions). These populations succeeded in maintaining a traditional lifestyle implying an intense physical activity that extends beyond the age of 80, a reduced level of stress and intensive family and community support for their oldest olds as well as the consumption of locally produced food. This is likely to have facilitated the accumulation of ideal conditions capable of limiting the factors that negatively impact on health in most Western populations.

It starts with describing general models that approach the sex-attachment link from an evolutionary and neurobiological perspective. Then, it summarizes theoretical and empirical ideas of attachment theory and describes how attachment style differences are manifested in intimate and sexual relationships. Research so far has been limited to studying the predicted link between sex and attachment in terms of broad descriptives, and it would benefit the literature to specify the processes and pathways that mediate the sex-attachment link. After a short discussion of the functional similarities between the sexual and the attachment systems, the article describes some specific-dynamical-models that focus on the emotional and cognitive-motivational processes through which attachment schemas influence sexual experiences.

40|$|Although {{environmental}} heterogeneity {{has been}} a focal point of ecological research for decades, we have tended to stick to comparatively formulaic interpretations of its dimensionality. In this thesis I explore alternative perspectives {{on the relationship between}} heterogeneity and plant community assembly in both spatial and temporal dimensions. Beginning with perhaps the most basic property of an ecological community, its taxonomic diversity, in Chapter 2 I investigate the explanatory power of fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in temporal climate variability. Consistent with coexistence theory, {{the results of this study}} indicate that climate variability can be a better predictor of richness than more commonly used climatic averages, and highlight the need for ecologists to expand their purview beyond absolutes and averages. Turning to multivariate distance-based descriptors of community structure, in Chapters 3 and 4, I consider the under-explored role of temporal scale and variability on inference in community phylogenetic and trait-dispersion studies. Given a classic Brownian model of trait evolution, in Chapter 3, I show that the expected functional displacement of any two taxa is most parsimoniously represented as a linear function of time's square root. On this basis I argue that existing methods overweight deep <b>time</b> <b>relative</b> to <b>recent</b> <b>time.</b> Taking into account this methodological adjustment, in Chapter 4, I use standard phylogenetic and functional-trait metrics to evaluate the temporal stability of community structure through succession in a fire-prone heathland. Contrary to widely-held assumptions, community structure did not become increasingly functionally and phylogenetically dispersed with time. This contributes to an emerging body of evidence indicating that limits to the similarity of coexisting species are rarely observed at fine-scales. In Chapter 5, I adopt a model-based approach to the analysis of species co-occurrence patterns in response to fine-scale spatial environmental heterogeneity. This study confirms the vital role of hydrological niches for the maintenance of within-community plant diversity. Two primary conclusions emerge from the thematically broad investigations within the thesis: subtle shifts in the scales at which spatial and temporal heterogeneity are examined can yield new insights into community assembly; and reliable mapping of processes from patterns requires the continuous scrutiny of paradigmatic assumptions...|$|R

Pre-vious studies suggest that taxonomic variation in the fre-quency of new behaviours (innovations) is correlated with variation <b>in</b> <b>relative</b> forebrain size. <b>Recent</b> work on pri-mates shows, however, that observer bias can affect inno-vation frequency. We assess this possibility in birds via three estimates in North America and Australia: the num-ber of full-length papers in academic journals, the fre-quency of photographs in birding magazines and a ques-tionnaire on reporting bias given to ornithologists at a meeting. We also look at sampling effects due to single journal sources by doing a split-half analysis of our North American database (The Wilson Bulletin vs. six other journals) and adding three new Australian journals to the one we had used previously. In multiple regressions that also included species number per taxon, none of the po-tential biases {{could account for the}} correlation between forebrain size and innovation frequency. Species number was the best predictor of full-length paper frequency, which was the best predictor of photograph numbers.

Monetary policy shocks are transmitted with the greatest impact, while supply and demand shocks trigger a far less pronounced reaction in Austria. Over time, monetary policy shocks have gained slightly in importance, while German demand shocks have become less important.
