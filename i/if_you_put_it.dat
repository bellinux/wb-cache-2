500|$|Modern {{scientific}} sources {{report that}} the alleged phenomenon is not real. In 1995, Professor Douglas Melton, of the Harvard University Biology department, said, [...] "If you put a frog in boiling water, it won't jump out. It will die. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in cold water, it will jump before it gets hot—they don't sit still for you." [...] Dr. George R. Zug, curator of reptiles and amphibians at the National Museum of Natural History, also rejected the suggestion, saying that [...] "If a frog had a means of getting out, it certainly would get out." ...|$|E
500|$|In his own words, Ocean {{calls the}} album [...] "nostalgic." [...] He explains, [...] "it's {{a longing for}} the past. That's what this record felt like." [...] The lyrical content, {{according}} to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to make a}} record that people could relate to. I was just trying to make a record with the shit that I wanted to express. The shit that I wanted to get off my chest. [...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are." [...] Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, [...] "you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time. I guess it all starts with the stories for me." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{supposed}} {{behavior of}} frogs illustrating nonaction is {{told in the}} often-repeated story of the boiled frog: put a frog in boiling water and it will jump out, but put it in cold water and slowly heat it, {{and it will not}} notice the danger and will be boiled alive. The story was based on nineteenth century experiments in which frogs were shown to stay in heating water {{as long as it was}} heated very slowly. The validity of the experiments is however disputed. Professor Douglas Melton, Harvard University Biology Department, says: [...] "If you put a frog in boiling water, it won't jump out. It will die. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in cold water, it will jump before it gets hot—they don't sit still for you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Experimentation with {{different}} effects pedals {{has led to}} Parker creating new and unique sounds. [...] "If you {{make an effort to}} not put the pedals in the order you're meant to, then you'll end up with something new sounding. We don't have any things that we got from another planet or anything, it's the same things everyone else has used." [...] "People have a distortion pedal and then a reverb pedal. A reverb is meant to make it sound like it's in a cathedral or something. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> the other way around, it won't sound like a guitar being played in a church, it'll sound like a church being stuffed inside a shoebox and then exploded. You can do different things just by treating things differently." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a June 1986 press conference, Mann {{said that}} the first season of the show would go from Chicago in 1963 to Las Vegas in 1980. He said, [...] "It's a serial {{in the sense that}} we have {{continuing}} stories, and in that sense the show is one big novel". Mann and Reininger's inspiration for the 1963-1980 arc came from their mutual admiration of the epic 15+ hour film, Berlin Alexanderplatz, by German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Mann said, [...] "The pace of our story is like the speed of light compared to that, but that's the idea— <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> all together at the end you've got one hell of a 22-hour movie". Mann predicted a five-year network run for the show. However, due to budgetary constraints (the need for four sets of period cars proved to be too expensive). Tartikoff eventually allowed their series to move to Las Vegas for the last quarter of the 22 episodes. [...] Ultimately, the show encompasses only the years 1963-64.|$|E
