Weizmann explained {{at the meeting}} that the Zionists had a preference for a British protectorate over Palestine, {{as opposed to an}} American, French or international arrangement; Balfour agreed, but warned that [...] "there may be difficulties with France and Italy".|$|E
500|$|Reflections from {{athletes and}} {{officials}} provide {{an insight into}} {{the value of this}} inaugural event. Bill Mather-Brown, an Australian athlete, said [...] "The 1962 Games was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been asked for an autograph. We regarded it as a compliment. We were mobbed, especially at the swimming pool. Sometimes we [...] were not sure people really wanted our signature or were just being polite and wanted us to feel good".|$|E
500|$|Since {{the release}} {{date for the}} film had been pre-determined and filming had {{finished}} close to that date, John Barry received some edits directly from the cutting-room floor, {{rather than as a}} finished edit, and scored some sequences from the rough initial prints. Barry described his work in Goldfinger as a favourite of his, saying it was [...] "the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> complete control, writing the score and the song". The musical tracks, in keeping with the film's theme of gold and metal, make heavy use of brass, and also metallic chimes. The film's score is described as [...] "brassy and raunchy" [...] with [...] "a sassy sexiness to it".|$|E

500|$|Angus Young later recalled, [...] "I {{remember}} the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ever heard Brian's (Johnson) name was from Bon. Bon had {{mentioned that he}} had been in England once touring with a band and he had mentioned that Brian had been in a band called Geordie and Bon had said 'Brian Johnson, he was a great rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard.' And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we said we should see if we can find him." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band played}} its first gig in May 1967, and had its first major break at the 7th National Jazz and Blues Festival in Windsor on 13 August. Oldham {{had managed to}} secure a {{separate}} set for the group in a side tent away from also accompanying Arnold on the main stage, where they gained attention. The next week, Welch wrote in the Melody Maker that [...] "it was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen a group actually {{in the act of}} winning its first following in quite dramatic circumstances". When Arnold went back to her family in the US shortly afterwards, Oldham offered the group a contract of their own. Hague was not interested in the [...] "progressive" [...] direction the group wanted to go in, so he was replaced by former Mark Leeman Five and Habits drummer Brian Davison.|$|E
500|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, Ramsey was conscripted into the British Army on 24 June 1940. He was assigned to the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry and underwent his initial training in Truro, where he and other recruits were housed in a hotel commandeered by the army. Ramsey found the experience a thrilling adventure. [...] "Until I travelled to Cornwall, the longest journey I had undertaken was a trip to Brighton by train," [...] he recalled. [...] "It was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ever been into a hotel! Even with us sleeping twelve to a room, on straw mattresses, could not end for me the awe of living in a swagger hotel." [...] "That set the tone for Alf's war," [...] Leo McKinstry suggests in his 2010 biography; attached to his regiment's 6th Battalion, Ramsey spent the entire war in Britain on home defence duties. The training was still physically demanding though, and, in Ramsey's words, made him [...] "a fitter young fellow than when I reported for duty as a grocery apprentice from Dagenham".|$|E

500|$|The second track, [...] "July 1st" [...] was {{composed}} by Nagao and Hamasaki. Japanese disc jockey Cool-K also included additional scratching on the track. As H was released during the Japanese summer, Hamasaki decided to incorporate a [...] "summer vibe" [...] to the tracks and, according to Tomita, [...] "July 1st" [...] was her strongest song to feature this. These themes {{had also been}} explored throughout I Am.... The lyrical content is [...] "uplifting and cheerful" [...] and talks about fun experiences; Hamasaki commented, [...] "This was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ever written a song [...] from this viewpoint, and I even surprised myself!" [...] "Hanabi" [...] talks about Hamasaki's views of the world, and discusses personal nostalgia. Hamasaki wanted the songs to be deeper, and Tomita commented that [...] "Hanabi" [...] {{was the first time}} he saw Hamasaki feel more engaged with global artists and incorporating those influences, rather than simply being influenced by Japanese music. [...] "Hanabi"'s title was written in English characters, and is the Japanese word for fireworks. The title was re-used on her single & for the track [...] "Hanabi (Episode II)".|$|E
500|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} Harrison {{had become an}} admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, {{introducing}} {{it to the other}} Beatles. During the filming of Help! in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga. Between {{the end of the last}} Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: [...] "For me, it was like a flash. The <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{friend of}} Richmond's father co-owned a sprint car and Richmond joined {{the team as}} a crew member for Dave Shoemaker. In 1976, 21-year-old Richmond took the car onto Lakeville Speedway at Lakeville, Ohio for some {{practice}} laps. [...] "Somebody put a stopwatch on me," [...] Richmond said. [...] "I was running laps faster than Dave had been. It was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ever driven a race car." [...] Richmond and his father found a red, white and blue-colored No. 98 car in Pennsylvania, which was the same number and paint scheme that Richmond used on model cars as a child. In his first competition at the track, officials placed Richmond in the slowest heat. He passed several cars before spinning out and breaking an axle. Although he made several attempts to get the car pointed in the right direction, the broken axle prevented the car from driving straight. After being towed to the pits, he parked the car {{for the rest of}} the event. Later that season, they towed the car to Eldora Speedway, only to have Richmond crash the car again. In response, Richmond's father fired him as the driver. The next season, Al Richmond bought a SuperModified better suited to his son's driving style. [...] In 1977 Tim Richmond became both Sandusky Speedway's Rookie of the Year and the SuperModified class track champion.|$|E

500|$|Beginning {{early in}} 1968, the group largely retired from touring, instead {{focusing}} on {{work in the}} studio. As the band was not available to promote their material, subsequent releases met with little success. The Kinks' next single, [...] "Wonderboy", released {{in the spring of}} 1968, stalled at number 36 and became the band's first single not to make the UK Top Twenty since their early covers. In the face of the band's declining popularity, Davies continued to pursue his personal song-writing style while rebelling against the heavy demands placed on him to keep producing commercial hits, and the group continued to devote time to the studio, centring on a slowly developing project of Ray's called Village Green. In an attempt to revive the group's commercial standing, the Kinks' management booked them on a month-long package tour for April, drawing the group away from the studio. The venues were largely cabarets and clubs; headlining was Peter Frampton's group The Herd. [...] "In general, the teenyboppers were not there to see the boring old Kinks, who occasionally had to endure chants of 'We Want The Herd!' during their brief appearances", commented Andy Miller. The tour proved taxing and stressful—Pete Quaife recalled, [...] "It was a chore, very dull, boring and straightforward... We only did twenty minutes, but it used to drive me absolutely frantic, standing on stage and playing three notes over and over again." [...] At the end of June, the Kinks released the single [...] "Days", which provided a minor, but only momentary, comeback for the group. [...] "I remember playing it when I was at Fortis Green the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a tape of it", Ray said. [...] "I played it to Brian, who used to be our roadie, and his wife and two daughters. They were crying at the end of it. Really wonderful—like going to Waterloo and seeing the sunset.... It's like saying goodbye to somebody, then afterwards feeling the fear that you actually are alone." [...] "Days" [...] reached number 12 in the United Kingdom and was a Top 20 hit in several other countries, but it did not chart in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1911 Constance Lytton {{was imprisoned}} in Holloway {{for the fourth}} time, after {{breaking}} windows in the Houses of Parliament, or of a Post Office in Victoria Street, London. However, conditions had improved, [...] "all was civility; it was unrecognisable from the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been there" [...] and suffragettes were treated as political prisoners.|$|E
2500|$|It was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{heard this}} great artist play. [...] He was most amiable at the rehearsal.... To this day I can recall how Rubinstein {{sat down at}} the piano, his leonine head thrown back slightly, and began the five opening {{measures}} of the principal theme.... It seemed to me I had never before heard the piano really played. [...] The grandeur of style with which Rubinstein presented those five measures, the beauty of tone his softness of touch secured, the art with which he manipulated the pedal, are indescribable ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{occurrence of}} the term [...] "InterCaps" [...] on Usenet is in an April 1990 post to the group alt.folklore.computers by Avi Rappoport. The earliest use of the name [...] "CamelCase" [...] occurs in 1995, in a post by Newton Love. Love has since said, [...] "With the advent of programming languages having these sorts of constructs, the humpiness of the style made me call it HumpyCase at first, before I settled on CamelCase. I had been calling it CamelCase for years. ... The citation above was just the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> used the name on USENET." ...|$|E
2500|$|Holland and Smith had {{difficulties}} in casting {{the role of}} Dr Legg, as they had problems finding an actor of the right age, intelligence, and class, who could also play a Jewish professional man. Jewish actor Leonard Fenton was suggested by the writer Bill Lyons and took {{a great interest in}} the role. Holland and Smith thought that he would be perfect and he was subsequently cast as Dr Legg. Fenton has since revealed that the character was based on him. He has commented, [...] "It wasn't easy raising a family on theatre wages, so EastEnders couldn't have come at a better time. It was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> played myself on television. I'm normally a character actor, but Dr Legg was based on me." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "At {{that time}} {{almost all the}} new bands [...] people who had {{previously}} been in successful bands who had broken up then reformed.... Well I played the first Ramones LP — it was identical to the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard Little Richard — the intensity was frightening! So I played five or six tracks on the next show and immediately I received mail from people demanding that I never play stuff like that again. Whenever that happens I always go in the opposite direction, so I played more and it was great! It was {{a classic case of}} changing courses in mid-stream and in a month {{the average age of the}} audience dropped by 10 years and the whole social class changed — which I was very pleased about." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shore {{was born}} in Toronto, Canada, to Henry and Charlotte Shore. She was the {{youngest}} of seven children. She was drawn to both painting and nature at a young age, remarking [...] "I was on my way home from school and saw myself reflected in a puddle. It was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen my image completely surrounded by nature, and I suddenly had an overwhelming sense of belonging to it—of actually being part of every tree and flower. I was filled with a desire to tell what I felt through painting." [...] Shore's mother supported Shore's artistic ambitions, but advised her to learn practical matters as well. After taking a domestic education class, at the age of 15, Shore began studying painting with the Canadian Impressionist Laura Muntz Lyall. Her works at this time are mostly genre scenes and thus conform to subject matter that would have been popular in Toronto's traditional art scene during the period.|$|E
2500|$|Stein's essay {{appeared}} in the February 1935 issue of The Lit with the title [...] "How Writing Is Written." [...] It has many times since been anthologized and given academic treatment, with the Choate text unaltered. It [...] "occupies a unique place in Stein's corpus as a social text that carries the marks of its particular occasion ... direct address to her audience (around sixty boys, as well as faculty and some former students)." [...] Stein's two-day stay at Choate was her first exposure to a private school, if we can believe her statement in Everybody's Autobiography (published 1937). She wrote, [...] "It was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> ever seen such a school. When I {{was brought up in}} East Oakland we all went to public school ... The boys from twelve to sixteen listened really listened [...] to everything I had to say ... I had been much struck by the Choate school literary magazine which did have extraordinary good writing in it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cinematographer Adam Greenberg, whose {{previous}} film credits included Three Men and a Baby, La Bamba and Near Dark, {{approached the}} film {{with a unique}} documentary-style technique. Commenting on the initial photography lighting tests, Greenberg remarked, [...] "The first ones were a disaster. They didn't look good at all. I didn't know how to photograph these aliens. It was the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{to deal with this}} kind of thing. But I have an eye and I learned from these tests." [...] At the Biltmore Hotel, a peculiar situation arose where the ceilings were simply too tall for standard lighting equipment. An ingenious idea was devised by the crew to have six to eight weather balloons sent up and have artificial light bounce off of them to create the proper lighting mood. Greenberg remarked, [...] "I wanted a very rich look from that place, gold and very warm. In the story it is very late after a big party. I wasn't going for any special effect, just nice light from lamps on the tables. The problem was, the hotel management wouldn't let us hang anything from the ceiling. In pre-production they had told us we could hang lights, but I didn't believe them. The ceilings there are very high and very beautiful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our {{numbers are}} going to turn up," [...] he insisted cheerfully. [...] "I am certain of it now. Do you know that this is the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> played since <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been in Monte Carlo?" ...|$|R
