6000|$|Nearly all {{the oyster}} shops and stands in Massachusetts, I am told, are {{supplied}} and kept by natives of Wellfleet, {{and a part}} of this town is still called Billingsgate from the oysters having been formerly planted there; but the native oysters are said to have died in 1770. Various causes are assigned for this, such as a <b>ground</b> <b>frost,</b> the carcasses of blackfish kept to rot in the harbor, and the like, but the most common account of the matter is,--and I find that a similar superstition with regard to the disappearance of fishes exists almost everywhere,--that when Wellfleet began to quarrel with the neighboring towns about the right to gather them, yellow specks appeared in them, and Providence caused them to disappear. A few years ago sixty thousand bushels were annually brought from the South and planted in the harbor of Wellfleet till they attained [...] "the proper relish of Billingsgate"; but now they are imported commonly full-grown, and laid down near their markets, at Boston and elsewhere, where the water, being a mixture of salt and fresh, suits them better.

50|$|Copley {{has its own}} {{official}} {{weather station}} run by the Met Office and Environment Agency. Because of its height above sea-level, around the 1,000 ft contour, and position in the north-east, this station is often one of the coldest in England with high incidences of <b>ground</b> <b>frosts</b> and snowfalls. Copley's situation in north-east England also places it in a relatively dry and sunny rain-shadow area in {{the shelter of the}} higher Pennines to the west. However, the higher Pennines can also create a local strong and gusty effect if the wind blows from the west-south-west. This is called the Pennine Lee Wave and can appear suddenly and disappear just as quickly.|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of introducing of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge into cultivation in Poland was investigated. The effect of method of introduction plantation on plant development and root mass was studied. The mass of raw material was higher {{in case of}} micropropagation. The roots of plants cultivated in Poland contained less tannins and more tanshinones than the Asiatic raw material (Salviae miltiorrhizae radix). Their contents of polyphenolic compounds were similar. In Polish cultivation Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge blossomed from May till August and fruited from August till first <b>ground</b> <b>frosts.</b> Dropping part of flowers and late fruitage prove, that Salvia miltiorrhiza is not entirely fitted into Polish climate conditions.

50|$|From 1906 to 1960 the Met Office {{practice}} was to base {{the number of}} days of <b>ground</b> <b>frost</b> on this criterion: a day with a minimum temperature reaching 30 °F (−1 °C), probably because 32 °F (0 °C) was not considered enough cold to cause damage to growing plants. Since 1961 the statistics have referred to {{the number of days}} with grass minimum temperature below 0°C.

These observations will allow determination of the surface kinetic temperature and thermal balance, and by coverage of the dark hemisphere, a search for regions with anomalous cooling can be made.

50|$|Parasitic modes {{occur when}} {{reflections}} are generated in directions other than {{along the length}} of the rod, which can use up energy that would otherwise be available to the beam. This can be a particular problem if the barrel of the rod is polished. Cylindrical laser rods support whispering gallery modes due to total internal reflection between the rod and the cooling water, which reflect continuously around the circumference of the rod. Light pipe modes can reflect down the length of the rod in a zig-zag path. If the rod has an antireflection coating, or is immersed in a fluid that matches its refractive index, it can dramatically reduce these parasitic reflections. Likewise, if the barrel of the rod is rough <b>ground</b> (<b>frosted),</b> or grooved, internal reflections can be dispersed.|$|R

30|$|The site {{consists}} of a predominantly south-east facing slope of over 40 ° in places, within a large paddock dominated by exotic pasture species. The soils of the rolling and hill land are Otangaroa clay and sandy clay loams (Sutherland et al. [1980]) taxonomically described as ‘wet soils’ of podzolised yellow-brown earths (Hewitt [1998]). The soils of the flood plains {{at the base of}} the ridge are Whakapara silt loam and clay loam, which are well to moderately well-drained ‘recent soils’ (Sutherland et al. [1980]) now classed as Mottled Fluvial Recent soils that have been derived from river alluvium (Hewitt [1998]). The elevation of the site is 20  m above sea level. The nearest weather station to Kaeo located at Kerikeri 25  km to the south has an average annual rainfall of 1682  mm, a daily mean temperature of 15.2 °C, an average of 25 <b>ground</b> <b>frosts</b> per year and an average of 2000 sunshine hours per year (New Zealand Meteorological Service [1983]).|$|R
50|$|The area of Rotorua has a {{relatively}} high altitude, measuring up to 290m or 950 ft. The Rotorua region enjoys a mild temperate climate. Rotorua is situated inland from the coast and is sheltered by high country {{to the south and}} east of the city, resulting in less wind than many other places in New Zealand. During the winter months June - August temperatures can drop well below 0 °C. Frost is common in Rotorua during its winter months, with an average of 57 <b>ground</b> <b>frosts</b> annually, and 20 nights per year below 0 °C. Snowfall in Rotorua is rare and since the 1970s has only been recorded twice. On 15 August 2011 and 13 July 2017 snowflakes fell in the town centre, and during the July 2017 snowfall, snow accumulated in the nearby Mamaku ranges and in the outer reaches of the district, where snowfall occurs on average once every three years.|$|R

50|$|The Rangipo Desert {{receives}} 1500 - 2500 mm {{of rainfall}} per year, but resembles a desert {{because of a}} poor soil quality and drying winds, and also due to the mass sterilization of seeds during a series of violent eruptions, particularly ignimbrite flows about 20,000 years ago. The vegetation is low and sparse, consisting of mainly tussock and snow grasses. The headwaters of many small streams, which later turn into large rivers, gouge deep serrated valleys through the unconsolidated ash and pumice-rich earth. The climate here is harsh and alpine, with close to 270 <b>ground</b> <b>frosts</b> per year in comparison with less than 30 in the coastal regions of Hawke's Bay, 80 km to the east. Heavy snowfalls - rarely seen {{in the rest of}} the island - are also a common occurrence in winter. Trampers and climbers in the area should be mindful of the extreme chill effect of the cold south wind which can produce wind chill factors lowering the temperature below zero for days on end.|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Forty-two native {{woody species}} were {{selected}} to represent the range of temperature-related ecological gradients in New Zealand. Twigs collected in July (mid-winter) were sent by air to Sapporo, Japan, where they were artificially hardened and then tested for freezing resistance. Although only one plant of each species was sampled from each site in anyone year, results were consistent from year to year. Freezing resistance of the plants correlates well with their natural distribution; for leaves this ranges from- 4 C or warmer for broad-leaved species not extending south of 39 o S, to- 18 o C to- 25 o o C for the hardiest high-altitude shrubby conifers. Ecotypic differences are also apparent. Air temperatures only occasionally reach or exceed the freezing resistance of local native species, but <b>ground</b> <b>frosts</b> {{are more likely to}} affect seedlings in frosty depressions. Other temperate, southern hemisphere, evergreen trees grown at Christchurch, New Zealand, show similar freezing resistances to native species, but two deciduous species of Nothofagus are hardier than evergreen Nothofagus. Even the hardiest New Zealand trees and shrubs compare only with trees growing in warm temperate, lowland districts of Japan...|$|R
