40|$|Urbanization {{influences}} {{hydrologic cycle}} significantly on local, regional even global scale. With urbanization the water resources demand for dense population sharpened, {{thus it is}} a great challenge to ensure water supply for some metropolises such as Beijing. <b>Urban</b> <b>area</b> is traditionally considered as the area with lower evapotranspiration (ET) on account of the impervious surface and the lower wind speed. For most remote sensing models, the ET, defined as latent heat in energy budget, is estimated as the difference between net radiation and sensible heat. The sensible heat is generally higher <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> due to the high surface temperature caused by heat island, therefore the latent heat (i. e. the ET) <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> is lower than that in other region. We estimated water consumption from 2003 to 2012 in Beijing based on water balance method and found that the annual mean ET <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> was about 654 mm. However, using Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model, the annual mean ET <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> was only 348 mm. We attributed this inconsistence to the impact of anthropogenic heat and quantified this impact {{on the basis of the}} night-light maps. Therefore, a new model SEBS-Urban, coupling SEBS model and anthropogenic heat was developed to estimate the ET <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area.</b> The ET <b>in</b> <b>urban</b> <b>area</b> of Beijing estimated by SEBS-Urban showed a good agreement with the ET from water balance method.
