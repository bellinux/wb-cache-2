5000|$|Appendix II, about 21,000 species, are {{species that}} are not {{necessarily}} threatened with extinction, but may become so unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulation {{in order to avoid}} utilization incompatible with the survival of the species in the wild. In addition, Appendix II can include species similar in appearance to species already listed in the Appendices. International trade in specimens of Appendix II species may be authorized by the granting of an export permit or re-export certificate. In practice, many hundreds of thousands of Appendix II animals are traded annually. [...] No import permit is necessary for these species under CITES, although some Parties do require import permits as part of their stricter domestic measures. A non-detriment finding and export permit are required by the <b>exporting</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
40|$|Parties to the {{convention}} on international trade in endangered species of {{wild fauna and flora}} (CITES) can export specimens if the <b>exporting</b> <b>party</b> issues a non-detriment finding (NDF), stating that removals will not harm wild populations. NDFs are supposed to be based on science. This article discusses the issuance, and acceptance, of non-detriment findings despite concerns expressed by experts and a lack of scientific data, using a controversial trade of dolphins as a case study. In early 2003, at least 94 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) were captured in the coastal waters of Solomon Islands. Bottlenose dolphins are listed on CITES Appendix II and as such require an NDF for their export. The IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group advised against this proposed export, stating that it knew of no published population assessments or other research upon which a valid NDF could be based. Despite this, in July 2003, 28 dolphins were exported to Mexico. A second controversial export occurred on 18 October 2007, when 28 dolphins were exported from Solomon Islands to the United Arab Emirates, an export regarding which IUCN experts again expressed concerns. Two additional exports, of 18 dolphins total, went to the Philippines in 2008.

40|$|In this {{presentation}} {{the relevant}} {{provisions of the}} Convention and the relevant sections from Resolutions are in normal type, and the proponents observations and remarks are in italics. 1. Article XIV 1. of the Convention provides the right for any Party to adopt stricter domestic measures for trade than are established by the Convention. [Almost certainly the drafters of the Convention meant that a range State was entitled to afford species within its country greater legal protection than that provided by the appendices of CITES. However, this provision has been used more by importing countries to restrict trade than it has by range States for protection purposes. ] 2. Resolution Conf. 2. 6 a) recommends that if a Party deems that an Appendix-II or-III species is being traded in a manner detrimental {{to the survival of}} that species, it should consult directly with the Management Authorities of the countries involved and/or make use of the options to take stricter domestic measures. [This is mildly prejudicial. Consulting with the Management Authority is an obvious first step. But if the species is being exploited unsustainably it is unlikely that stricter domestic measures imposed by an importing country will correct the problem. If the Scientific and Management Authorities in an importing State are better able to determine that a species is being exploited unsustainably in a range State than its own Scientific and Management Authorities then they have a moral responsibility to assist the <b>exporting</b> <b>Party</b> with a management programme for the species. ...|$|E

25|$|After the war, a {{vigorous}} debate among the civilian elites spawned {{the development of}} two new political parties. Silver mining entrepreneurs, who had {{become the most important}} economic group in the country, created the Conservative Party (Partido Conservador) led by Mariano Baptista, a vocal opponent of the War of the Pacific. Conservatives favored reaching a quick peace settlement with Chile that would include a financial indemnity for the lost territories and enable Bolivia to construct a railroad for continued mining <b>exports.</b> The Liberal <b>Party</b> (Partido Liberal) was founded in 1883 by the former chief of staff, General Eliodoro Camacho and was more hawkish, as it denounced the pacifism of the Conservatives and any peace treaty with Chile. Liberals also resented the dependence of the mining industry on Chilean and British capital and hoped to attract United States investments.|$|R
50|$|Alia was {{established}} in 1994 as a Jordanian-registered transportation company, intended to refurbish Iraqi vessels stranded {{off the coast of}} Jordan for commercial use. 51% ownership was held by a Jordanian national, who held them on behalf of a close Iraqi associate, and the remaining two shares were held by assigned Iraqi Ministry of Transportation employees. In 1999, it was arranged by the Ministry of Transportation for Alia to commence inland transportation of goods arriving at the Umm Qasr, Iraq's only port. Alia was to receive a commission on the cost of these goods, paid for initially by the company bringing goods into Iraq, and then tacked onto the total bill of the Iraqi Government. They advertised this new arrangement through their usual tender process. Under the sanctions regime, third parties were prohibited from engaging with the Government of Iraq unless they had Security Council approval. By having the <b>party</b> <b>exporting</b> goods (i.e. the humanitarian supplier) be the one to pay Alia, the Iraqi Government was able to disguise this.|$|R

The country {{became the first}} post-Soviet state where a non-reformed Communist Party returned to power. New governments were formed by Vasile Tarlev (19 April 2001 - 31 March 2008), and Zinaida Greceanîi (31 March 2008 - 14 September 2009). In 2001-2003 relations between Moldova and Russia improved, but then temporarily deteriorated in 2003-2006, {{in the wake of}} the failure of the Kozak memorandum, culminating in the 2006 wine <b>exports</b> crisis. The <b>Party</b> of Communists of the Republic of Moldova managed to stay in power for eight years. The fragmentation of the liberal bloc (aka the democrats) helped consolidate its power. The decline of the Communist Party started in 2009 after Marian Lupu joined the Democratic Party and thus attracted many of the Moldovans supporting the Communists.|$|R
40|$|This report, {{commissioned}} by Sveriges Riksbank, examines {{the role of}} currency denomination in international trade transactions. It is divided in two parts. The first part consists of {{a survey of the}} price setting and payment practices of a large sample of Swedish exporting firms. The second part analyzes payments data from the Swedish settlement reports from 1999 - 2002. We examine whether invoicing patterns of Swedish and European companies changed following the creation of the EMU and how the currency denomination of exports differ from that of imports. Finally we consider the possibility that changes in invoicing patterns are correlated with changes in nominal exchange rates. Our main finding is that the same currency to a large extent is used for price setting, invoicing and payment for <b>exports</b> to third <b>parties.</b> We also find that the currency of the customer is the most used and that the euro is replacing the Swedish krona both in transactions with EMU-member countries but outside the EMU. Finally we find some evidence of a weak correlation between aggregate changes in invoicing patterns and changes in the trade weighted exchange rate over the period 1999 - 2002.

40|$|Prior {{studies have}} argued and {{regularly}} found that cultural distance is {{negatively related to}} bilateral export flows, which are the sum of arm’s length and intra-firm exports. However, these macro-level studies overlook the firm-level insights that arm’s length exports are a substitute for arm’s length affiliate sales, and that firms’ choices between these substitutes are influenced by cultural distance. Moreover, intra-firm exports are a complement to arm’s length affiliate sales and hence likely to respond {{in the same way}} to cultural distance as such sales. The inclusion of intra-firm exports in export flows has thus obscured the effect of cultural distance on aggregate arm’s length exports. We overcome these conceptual and methodological deficiencies by examining how cultural distance influences aggregate arm’s length exports, while simultaneously considering its impact on aggregate arm’s length affiliate sales. Drawing on several strands of firm-level international business (IB) research, we argue that while arm’s length affiliate sales are likely to decline with cultural distance, this is not necessarily the case with arm’s length exports, whichmay in fact increase with cultural distance. Analyzing a panel dataset of US foreign affiliate sales and US <b>exports</b> to unaffiliated <b>parties,</b> we find that cultural distance negatively affects arm’s length affiliate sales but positively affects arm’s length exports. Our study thus shows that the explicit consideration of firm-level entry mode choices helps us better understand and explain macro-level IB activity...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} choices of production/marketing strategies used by U. S. multinational corporations (MNCs) in selling and exporting to foreign markets. The varying degree of control a U. S. MNC possesses over its affiliates translates to a varying degree of control it retains over a transaction. A transaction with an unaffiliated firm represents a transaction over which the U. S. MNC has no control; while a transaction with a MOFA represents one over which it has complete control. Transactions with JVs fall in between. Using the shares for unaffiliated parties, MOFAs, and JVs as the three dependent variables, this study tested the empirical relevance of the internalization hypotheses, using both the sales share and the export share model.;The 2 ̆ 2 Amemiya-Tobin 2 ̆ 2 approach of Wales and Woodland was used to estimate the system of share equations. This procedure explicitly builds in the adding-up restriction on shares and allows for the occurrence of zero values {{for one or two}} shares in a three-share system. The log likelihood function for the Amemiya-Tobin model was maximized by numerical methods.;Data was collected from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Bureau of Census, the World Bank and the Internet ([URL] The final data set was for country-industry pairs, at the loaves, level of industry aggregation available.;The results for the sales share and the export share models show the importance of the internalization hypothesis: R 2 ̆ 6 D expenditure, which served as a proxy for the specialized knowledge of U. S. parent, had a significantly positive impact on MOFA sales and exports to MOFAs. It had a negative impact on the sales and <b>exports</b> to unaffiliated <b>parties.</b> Complementary knowledge of foreign enterprises, which was measured by the number of patent applications filed by the residents of a country, was positively related to the share of sales by joint ventures, and negatively related to the share of sales by MOFAs. However, patent applications did not {{play a significant role in}} this model. Importantly, these two results together show the influence of the 2 ̆ 2 ownership of knowledge 2 ̆ 2 in determining the organizational form chosen by U. S. MNCs...|$|R
