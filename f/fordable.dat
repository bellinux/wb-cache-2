5|$|According to Jain texts, 24 Tirthankaras have {{appeared}} on earth in the current time cycle of Jain cosmology. Mahavira was the last Tirthankara of Avasarpiṇī (present descending phase or half of the time cycle). A Tirthankara (Maker of the River-Crossing, saviour, spiritual teacher) signifies the founder of a tirtha, which means a <b>fordable</b> passage across the sea of interminable cycles of births and deaths (called saṃsāra).|$|E
5|$|Blythburgh, a {{mile from}} Bulcamp and {{situated}} near the <b>fordable</b> headwaters of the Blyth estuary, was afterwards {{believed to be the}} location of the tombs of Anna and Jurmin. It is a candidate for a monastic site or a royal regio (estate). According to Peter Warner, the Latin derivation of part of the nearby place-name 'Bulcamp' indicates its ancient origins, and mediaeval sources which claim continuous Christian worship at Blythburgh throughout the Anglo-Saxon period provide circumstantial evidence of its connections with East Anglian royalty and Christianity. Part of an 8th-century whalebone diptych or writing-tablet, used for liturgical purposes, has been found near the site.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages, {{the site}} of the future palace formed part of the Manor of Ebury (also called Eia). The marshy ground was watered by the river Tyburn, which still flows below the {{courtyard}} and south wing of the palace. Where the river was <b>fordable</b> (at Cow Ford), the village of Eye Cross grew. Ownership of the site changed hands many times; owners included Edward the Confessor and his queen consort Edith of Wessex in late Saxon times, and, after the Norman Conquest, William the Conqueror. William gave the site to Geoffrey de Mandeville, who bequeathed it to the monks of Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth {{had been}} a {{significant}} border settlement since the Roman occupation of Britain, when it {{was the site of}} the fort of Blestium. The River Wye may have been bridged at this time but the Monnow, being easily <b>fordable,</b> appears not to have had a crossing until after the Norman Conquest. According to the local tradition, construction of Monnow Bridge began in 1272 to replace a 12th-century Norman timber bridge. Through the medieval era, the English Civil War, and the Chartist uprising, the bridge played a significant, if ineffectual, role in defending Monmouth. It also served as a gaol, a munitions store, a lodge, an advertising hoarding, a focus for celebrations and, most significantly, as a toll gate. Much of the medieval development of Monmouth was funded by the taxes and tolls the borough was entitled to raise through Royal Charter. The tolls were collected through control of the points of entry to the town, including the gatehouse on Monnow Bridge.|$|E
5|$|However, the Germans {{were now}} {{trapped in the}} {{interior}} of Gaul, as their return route to the Rhine was barred by the Roman armies. In Julian's sector, the Caesar despatched squadrons of cavalry to lie in ambush on three roads and these successfully intercepted and destroyed the returning barbarian bands. But in Barbatio's sector, the main body of Germans were allowed to pass unmolested: Barbatio's chief-of-staff Cella rejected the urgent plea of two of his cavalry tribuni (regimental commanders) Valentinianus (later emperor Valentinian I ruled 364-75) and Bainobaudes to deploy their squadrons on a highway that they expected the enemy would use. The escaping force reached some islands in the Rhine near Strasbourg where the raiding-bands had moved their camps for safety in response to the Roman pincer movement. Nevertheless, Julian pursued them vigorously. Although without boats, his men succeeded in reaching one island, as the river had become <b>fordable</b> at some points due to summer drought. An entire raiding-band was surprised and slaughtered, a success repeated on a few other islands. In response, the Germans evacuated the remaining islands, removing their sutlers, baggage and booty {{to the far side of}} the Rhine.|$|E
25|$|The word Tīrthaṅkara {{signifies the}} founder of a tirtha which means a <b>fordable</b> passage across a sea. The Tirthankara show the 'fordable path' across the sea of interminable births and deaths. Rishabhanatha was the first Tirthankara and Mahavira was the last Tirthankara of avasarpani (present half of the Jain cosmic time cycle).|$|E
25|$|Boston Avenue {{breaks off}} from Barnum Avenue near the Bridgeport line in Stratford and travels east-west over Old Mill Hill to the Upper East Side toward the North End. It follows {{the route of}} an Indian path, {{crossing}} Old Mill Brook and the Pequonnock River and the southernmost points where they were <b>fordable,</b> that became the Post Road in the 1670s.|$|E
25|$|At {{the centre}} of Osraige, Kilkenny grew from a monastic settlement, now St Canice's Cathedral on the hill above the bridge, to a {{thriving}} Norman merchant town in the Middle Ages. The location of a slow-moving and relatively easily <b>fordable</b> point on the Nore which had used from at least the 10th century. Three important roads forded the Nore and Bregagh, including from Old Leighlin and Rosconnail (south of Ballyragget).|$|E
25|$|The Confederate {{withdrawal}} from the Lynchburg stage road at this location allowed the Union cavalry to occupy {{a segment of the}} road and block the Confederate escape route toward Lynchburg. The Appomattox River was not <b>fordable</b> in this vicinity, which prevented a Confederate escape to the north, an option without much possible benefit in any event. Union troops blocked the Army of Northern Virginia's movements in the other directions.|$|E
25|$|On 17 May {{having left}} garrisons in IJzendijke and Aardenburg the Anglo Dutch force {{advanced}} against the Spaniards. Count Ernest led the vanguard, with the cavalry under Marcellus Bacx, {{but they were}} taken at a disadvantage and Spanish resistance soon toughened. As a result, the Dutch suddenly fell backwards down the stream to a point which Velasco {{who had been in}} pursuit had discovered it to be <b>fordable</b> at low water.|$|E
25|$|Kilmaine's troops {{pushed back}} the Austrian hussar {{outposts}} {{and reached the}} bridge about 9 am. When the retreating horsemen reached the bridge, there was a jam on the narrow span. A number of Austrians left the roadway and crossed the river, betraying the <b>fordable</b> points to the French. Only single battalions of the Strassoldo Infantry Regiment Nr. 27 and Jordis Infantry Regiment Nr. 59 were available to defend the span. Under the direction of Pittoni, the badly outnumbered Austrians put up a spirited fight. But, with Beaulieu's army in some disorder, few reserves arrived to help the defenders and soon French troops led by Chef de Brigade Gaspard Amédée Gardanne forded the river and pushed the defenders uphill toward Valeggio.|$|E
25|$|Cassivellaunus {{realised}} {{he could}} not defeat Caesar in a pitched battle. Disbanding {{the majority of his}} force and relying on the mobility of his 4,000 chariots and superior knowledge of the terrain, he used guerrilla tactics to slow the Roman advance. By the time Caesar reached the Thames, the one <b>fordable</b> place available to him had been fortified with sharpened stakes, both on the shore and under the water, and the far bank was defended. Second Century sources state that Caesar used a large war elephant, which was equipped with armour and carried archers and slingers in its tower, to put the defenders to flight. When this unknown creature entered the river, the Britons and their horses fled and the Roman army crossed over and entered Cassivellaunus' territory.|$|E
25|$|The rebels {{held the}} hills {{to the west}} of Carthage and the only bridge across the Bagradas river leading to Utica. Hamilcar {{observed}} that wind blowing from a certain direction uncovered a sandbar at the river mouth that was <b>fordable</b> and, under cover of night, the Punic army left Carthage and crossed the river. Hamilcar aimed to attack the small rebel band holding the bridge, but Spendius led the rebel force besieging Utica to confront Hamilcar. The Carthaginian army was caught in a pincer movement, he pretended to retreat, and when the rebel formation became disordered, Hamilcar, by brilliant maneuvering, heavily defeated their forces, killing 8,000 mercenaries and capturing 2,000 men. Hamilcar occupied the bridge, then established control over the surrounding region while part of the surviving rebels fled towards Utica and others, after being driven from their camp near the bridge, fled to Tunis.|$|E
25|$|While Dupont lingered at Andújar {{with two}} {{divisions}} (Generals Barbou and Fresia), attempting {{to master the}} strategic Madrid—Seville highway and the wide plains which it crossed, Castaños' four divisions advanced steadily {{from the south and}} guerrillas from Granada marched to bar the road to the sierra and La Mancha beyond. Vedel's division was posted east to Bailén with a view to guarding these nearby mountain passes and on July 1 Vedel was forced to dispatch a brigade under General Cassagne to curb the advance of the guerrillas on Jaén and La Carolina, stretching the French line still further east. Meanwhile, General Liger-Belair with 1,500 men moved into a forward post at Mengibar, a village on the south bank of the Guadalquivir. At Andújar a tower by the river was fortified and small field works constructed on the south bank to forestall an enemy crossing, but, the Guadalquivir being <b>fordable</b> at so many points, and open to fire from the surrounding hills, Dupont's defences did not inspire much confidence. Cassagne, after driving the guerrillas off in rout, returned to Bailén on July 5 with 200 dead or wounded and nothing to show for his exertion—the Spaniards having plundered the towns of all provisions.|$|E
25|$|Hagood {{had burned}} the only bridge across Town Creek {{to slow down}} Cox and entrenched {{on the north side}} of the river. Cox was eager to attempt his {{encircling}} plan that, due to Hagood's retreat at Fort Anderson, the Federals had been unable to complete. The creek was not <b>fordable,</b> so on February 20 Cox's troops found a single flat-bottom boat in the river and used it to ferry three brigades across the creek while the fourth brigade skirmished with Hagood as a diversion. Hagood discovered the flanking movement and decided, since his position was now untenable, to retreat back to Wilmington; he left two regiments to cover his retreat. The Federals then waded through the swamp and attacked the Confederate flank, routing the two regiments, and taking 375 prisoners along with two pieces of artillery. The next day Cox rebuilt the destroyed bridge and Schofield's artillery crossed and along with Porter's gunboats both were within range of the city itself. General Bragg saw the hopelessness of the situation and ordered the city abandoned. On February 21 Cox's division continued its march toward the city but was delayed by the destroyed bridges across the Brunswick River and by Confederate cavalry, while Hoke's division continued to hold off Terry's command. Bragg used the 21st to evacuate Union prisoners located there, while evacuating anything of military value; he also ordered bales of cotton and tobacco burned so that they would not fall into Union hands, along with storehouses, foundries, shipyards, and ships. Bragg retreated with his forces at 1 a.m. on the 22nd; Cox's corps entered the city after 8 a.m., with Terry's forces entering an hour later.|$|E
500|$|On 23 September, Windeyer {{ordered an}} advance on Finschhafen. Lieutenant Colonel Colin Grace's 2/15th Infantry Battalion reached the Bumi River at 12:40. It was [...] wide and {{appeared}} <b>fordable,</b> but the banks contained {{barbed wire and}} strongly fortified Japanese positions. While Yamada was withdrawing towards Sattelberg, the Japanese marines of the 85th Garrison Unit remained in place. Yamada had no authority over the marines, and its commander, Captain Tsuzuki, {{saw no reason to}} conform to Yamada's actions. He intended to hold Finschhafen for as long as possible. Grace ordered Major Ron Suthers to outflank the Japanese position by moving through the foothills of the Kreutberg Range, as previously instructed by Windeyer. While not high, these were very steep and covered in thick vegetation.|$|E
500|$|The {{battlefield}} stretched {{for nearly}} [...] The extreme right {{flank of the}} Franco-Bavarian army was covered by the Danube; to the extreme left flank lay the undulating pine-covered hills of the Swabian Jura. A small stream, the Nebel, (the ground either side of which was soft and marshy and only <b>fordable</b> intermittently), fronted the French line. The French right rested on the village of Blenheim near where the Nebel flows into the Danube; the village itself was surrounded by hedges, fences, enclosed gardens, and meadows. Between Blenheim and the next village of Oberglauheim the fields of wheat had been cut to stubble and were now ideal to deploy troops. From Oberglauheim to the next hamlet of Lutzingen the terrain of ditches, thickets and brambles was potentially difficult ground for the attackers.|$|E
500|$|The {{regiment}} {{was next}} {{involved in a}} raid on the village of Amman {{to the east of}} the River Jordan. The force assembled for the operation comprised the ANZAC Mounted Division, the 60th (London) Division and the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade. Reconnaissance patrols had discovered that the river was not <b>fordable</b> and they would have to construct bridges to get across. Three viable sites had been selected at Makhadet (which means ford), Hajlah [...] north of the Dead Sea, and Ghoraniyeh. Two crossings were to be constructed. At Hajlaha, pontoon bridge made from steel would be assembled for the mounted troops. The second crossing point, at Ghoraniyeh where there was already a damaged pontoon bridge, would have three bridges for the 60th Division: a normal pontoon bridge, a barrel bridge, and an infantry bridge.|$|E
500|$|By the {{afternoon}} of 18 February, the rains had abated and lower water levels made the Gebora River <b>fordable</b> again. [...] That evening Soult sent nine infantry battalions, three cavalry squadrons and two artillery batteries, under Mortier's command, to the north bank across a flying bridge over the Guadiana River. Joined by six cavalry regiments under Latour-Maubourg, the French now had 4,500 infantrymen, 2,500 cavalry and 12 cannon ready to attack the Spanish lines at dawn on 19 February. [...] Due to heavy fog that morning, Mendizabal {{was unaware of the}} approaching French until his picket, only a mile from his front, was driven back by Mortier's infantry fording the Gebora. At the same time the 2nd Hussars, sent by Latour-Maubourg to turn the Spanish left flank, had managed to climb the heights to the north, also undetected, and fell upon one of de España's unsuspecting regiments.|$|E
500|$|Chelsea (Old English Cealchyð, chalk wharf), about [...] west of Westminster on {{the north}} bank of the River Thames, has existed as a {{settlement}} since at least Anglo-Saxon times. The Thames at this point inflects through a sharp angle from a south-north to an east-west flow, and the slow-moving and relatively easily <b>fordable</b> river here is popularly {{believed to be the}} site of Julius Caesar's crossing of the Thames during the 54 BC invasion of Britain. Chelsea enjoyed good road and river connections to the seat of government at Westminster and the commercial centre of the City of London since at least the 14th century. It was a centre of the British porcelain industry, and a major producer of baked goods– at peak periods almost 250,000 chelsea buns per day were sold. By the 18th century it had large numbers of very prosperous residents.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, a force under Lieutenant Colonel J. T. Lang, {{consisting}} of the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion, 2/6th Field Company, and detachments from the 7th Division Signals, 2/5th Field Ambulance and ANGAU, with 760 native carriers, set out from Tsili Tsili on 2 September. Most of the force moved overland, reaching Kirkland's Crossing on 4 September, where it rendezvoused with B Company, Papuan Infantry Battalion. That night, a party of engineers and pioneers set out from Tsili Tsili in 20 small craft, sailed and paddled down the Watut and Markham Rivers to join Lang's force at Kirkland's Crossing. The small river-borne task force included 10 British 5-ton folding assault boats and Hoehn military folboats. which met up with 2/6 Independent Commandos who had reconnoitered the proposed crossing area with 8 of these folboats the day before. While neither river was deep, both were fast flowing, with shoals and hidden s. Three boats were lost with their equipment and one man drowned. On the morning of 5 September, Lang's force was treated {{to the sight of}} the air force passing overhead. At this point, the Markham River formed three arms, separated by broad sand bars. Two were <b>fordable</b> but the other was deep and flowing at [...] Using the folding boats and local timber, they constructed a pontoon bridge, allowing the whole force to cross the river safely with all their equipment. That evening, they reached the Americans' position.|$|E
2500|$|After {{collecting}} their prisoners, the 4th Light Horse Regiment arrived near Kaukab ridge when patrols {{found the}} Nahr Barbar, flowing through a valley to {{the slopes of}} Mount Hermon, easily <b>fordable</b> [...] "at almost any place for mounted troops." ...|$|E
2500|$|Like most of {{the upper}} Don, the river at Oughtibridge appears fairly benign, with it having a small flow and being easily <b>fordable</b> below the weir {{to the south of}} the bridge. [...] However, as {{discussed}} in the Flooding section above, its wide catchment area and the sometimes-extreme weather in the Pennines makes the river susceptible to occasional flooding. [...] The two photographs illustrate the contrast.|$|E
2500|$|The wide Danube {{was always}} <b>fordable</b> {{at this point}} because of {{a small number of}} islands {{in the middle of the}} river. The city has marked {{topographical}} contrasts: Buda is built on the higher river terraces and hills of the western side, while the considerably larger Pest spreads out on a flat and featureless sand plain on the river's opposite bank. [...] Pest's terrain rises with a slight eastward gradient, so the easternmost parts of the city lie at the same altitude as Buda's smallest hills, notably Gellért Hill and Castle Hill.|$|E
2500|$|Inclement weather, {{including}} an early snowstorm, slowed progress. On November 24 the 1st Cavalry reached Mule Springs, in Moore County, approximately [...] west of Adobe Walls. That same afternoon the Indian scouts reported {{they had found}} the trail of a large Indian village. Carson left his infantry behind to guard his supply train and ordered a night march of cavalry and artillery. He rode in the van with the Utes and Jicarillas. Next morning he ordered the two howitzers forward {{to join him in}} the van. Coming to the easily <b>fordable</b> Canadian River, he deployed one company of cavalry {{on the north side of}} the river and continued with the remainder on the south side.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is presumed}} {{that the area}} around Lauffen had already been settled in pre-Christian times, {{although}} the only evidence consists of a few bones. The settlement’s high level of frequentation {{can be attributed to}} the shallow water between the present old Neckar bridge and the cliffs by the castle and Regiswindis Church. [...] Here the river was <b>fordable</b> for most of the year and the spot used by both men and animals as a crossing point. Such opportunities were few and far between along this stretch of the original Neckar. [...] Indeed, the nearest fords were some kilometres distant. The two prominent cliffs may well have served as lookouts and refuges since primeval times.|$|E
2500|$|The reach at Clifton Hampden was rocky and shallow, {{with water}} levels often {{dropping}} to barely [...] {{so it was}} usually <b>fordable</b> by cattle and horses. The earliest record of a ferry is a mention of John Broun being ferryman in the early 14th century. The archives of Exeter College, Oxford show that Clifton Ferry {{was given to the}} college in 1493 by a Watlington draper called Roger Roper; the college owned the ferry right up until 1861 when it was bought out in preparation for the building of the bridge. In 1607 a ferry at Clifton is mentioned as the downstream limit of improvement works undertaken by the 1605 Oxford-Burcot Commission. In Thomas Baskerville's travel journal of 1692 he notes [...] "At Clifton fferry [...] is a great boat to carry horse and man" [...] whilst an 1829 tour notes [...] "an ancient ferry" [...] with a [...] "boat passing continually to and fro".|$|E
2500|$|At 11:00 A.M. on 11 May, Billotte {{diverted}} {{most of the}} French 23rd Fighter Group (Fighter Groupement 23) {{to cover}} the advance of the First Army and its neighbouring units. After more fighters had been removed for bomber escort missions, few fighters were left to cover the cavalry. The Allied bombers concentrated on retarding the dangerous advance of Hoepner's Panzers. Prioux's ground reconnaissances fell back before the Panzers, toward {{the main body of}} French cavalry, which was established in strongpoints along a 40km front with the 2d DLM from Huy on the Meuse and north, then westward along the Mehaigne creek. The 3d DLM formed a front from the area of Crehen to Orp and then northward along the Petite Gette stream to the area of Tirlemont. The battleground which Prioux chose consisted of a plateau with occasional woods, a dense road network, extended localities and a few isolated large farms. The Mehaigne and Petite Gette were small streams flowing within two-to-three-meter-deep rock cuts with many crossing points, often <b>fordable</b> by tracked vehicles, and offering good cover for would-be infiltrators. But the key terrain feature was the ridge running from Hannut through Crehen and Merdorp. [...] North of the ridge, the Petite Gette flowed north into the Escaut river, south of it, the Mehaigne flowed south into the Meuse. This ridge formed a natural corridor for mechanized forces.|$|E
2500|$|One {{result of}} the {{narrowing}} of the East River along the shoreline of Manhattan and, later, Brooklyn [...] which continued until the mid-19th century when the state {{put a stop to}} it [...] was an increase in the speed of its current. Buttermilk Channel, the strait that divides Governors Island from Red Hook in Brooklyn, and which is located directly south of the [...] "mouth" [...] of the East River, was in the early 17th century a <b>fordable</b> waterway across which cattle could be driven. [...] Further investigation by Colonel Jonathan Williams determined that the channel was by 1776 three fathoms deep (...) , five fathoms deep (...) in the same spot by 1798, and when surveyed by Williams in 1807 had deepened to 7 fathoms (...) at low tide. [...] What had been almost a bridge between two landforms which were once connected had become a fully navigable channel, thanks to the constriction of the East River and the increased flow it caused. Soon, the current in the East River had become so strong that larger ships had to use auxiliary steam power in order to turn. [...] The continued narrowing of the channel on both side may have been the reasoning behind the suggestion of one New York State Senator, who wanted to fill in the East River and annex Brooklyn, with the cost of doing so being covered byselling the newly made land. [...] Others proposed a dam at Roosevelt Island (then Blackwell's Island) to create a wet basin for shipping.|$|E
2500|$|However, though Dafydd's rule began auspiciously and in [...] "peace and security", {{there were}} plots devised {{to reduce his}} and his house's influence, both in Gwynedd and over the whole of Wales. Claimants to the lands Llywelyn {{incorporated}} into his expanded principality petitioned the English king for redress. Diplomatic and legal battles ensued throughout 1241 as Dafydd agreed to put {{the matter of the}} disputed lands to a committee of arbitrators, partly English and partly Welsh, and headed by the pope's legate Otto. Collectively the arbitrators were deputized to adjudicate on the legal possessors of the lands in question. However, Dafydd subsequently failed to appear at three of the designated hearings, which delayed the proceedings. Patience exhausted, Henry III gathered a host and prepared to invade Wales in July and August in direct violation to the church sanctioned arbitration agreement. In the face of the military intervention before him, Prince Dafydd was almost bereft of any allies. Gruffydd ap Madog of upper Powys (son of Madog, who had been an ardent supporter and vassal of Dafydd's father Llywelyn), Maredudd ap Rhotpert, and Maelgwn Fychan all deserted him. Additionally, Henry III granted the petition of Senena, wife of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, to force Dafydd to release her husband from confinement and to be restored to a portion of Gwynedd as was due his inheritance. With the summer of 1241 remarkably dry, Dafydd found himself abandoned of yet another ally which, as Lloyd wrote, [...] "rarely failed a Welsh chief in his hour of need, the Welsh climate." [...] Marshes dried up, rivers became <b>fordable</b> while lakes shrank into shallow pools, and the natural obstacles which usually made campaigning in Wales most difficult all but disappeared. Within four weeks Henry was at Rhuddlan and Dafydd agreed to submit before him.|$|E
60|$|They {{sent two}} men up the {{additional}} river some length, {{and they brought}} word that it was indeed narrower by much, but nowhere <b>fordable,</b> but deep and rapid.|$|E
60|$|As the Coa was <b>fordable</b> {{at several}} points lower down, and the French could {{therefore}} {{have turned the}} position next day, the British troops fell back during the night behind the Pinhel river, where Picton's division was also encamped.|$|E
60|$|Four {{days later}} the new breach had {{attained}} a width of thirty yards, but Clive had prepared defences in the rear, similar to those at the other breach; and the difficulties of the besiegers would here be much greater, as the ditch was not <b>fordable.</b>|$|E
60|$|Early {{the next}} morning Holkar's cavalry appeared, and encamped at a {{distance}} of four miles. The next day the river was <b>fordable,</b> and most of the baggage and four battalions crossed. The enemy's cavalry also crossed in great numbers, both to the right and left of the British position.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly {{they rode}} ten {{miles or more}} along the bank without seeing a soul, till they reached a space of bubbling, shallow water that looked <b>fordable.</b> Indeed, an {{investigation}} of the banks revealed the fact that a loaded waggon had passed the river here and at no distant date, perhaps a week before.|$|E
60|$|The Indus {{had risen}} in flood without warning. Last {{night it was}} a <b>fordable</b> shallow; to-night five miles of raving muddy water parted bank and caving bank, and the river was still rising under the moon.
