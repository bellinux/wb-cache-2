5|$|Although sawgrass and sloughs are the {{enduring}} geographical icons of the Everglades, other ecosystems {{are just as}} vital, and the borders marking them are subtle or nonexistent. Pinelands and tropical hardwood hammocks are located throughout the sloughs; the trees, rooted in soil <b>inches</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> peat, marl, or water, support a variety of wildlife. The oldest and tallest trees are cypresses, whose roots are specially adapted to grow underwater {{for months at a}} time. The Big Cypress Swamp is well known for its 500-year-old cypresses, though cypress domes can appear throughout the Everglades. As the fresh water from Lake Okeechobee makes its way to Florida Bay, it meets salt water from the Gulf of Mexico; mangrove forests grow in this transitional zone, providing nursery and nesting conditions for many species of birds, fish, and invertebrates. The marine environment of Florida Bay is also considered part of the Everglades because its sea grasses and aquatic life are attracted to the constant discharge of fresh water.|$|E
5|$|Josephson {{said that}} Trinity College's long {{interest}} in the paranormal meant {{that he did not}} dismiss these ideas out of hand. Several presidents of the Society for Psychical Research had been fellows of Trinity, and the Perrott-Warrick Fund, set up in Trinity in 1937 to fund parapsychology research, is still administered by the college. He continued to explore {{the idea that there is}} intelligence in nature, particularly after reading Fritjof Capra's The Tao of Physics (1975), and in 1979 took up a more advanced form of TM, known as the TM-Sidhi program. According to Anderson, the TM movement produced a poster showing Josephson levitating several <b>inches</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> floor. Josephson argued that meditation could lead to mystical and scientific insights, and that, as a result of it, he had come to believe in a creator.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} earthquake, the News-Miner placed {{an order for}} a modern offset {{printing}} press. To house the new press, which could not fit in the Lathrop Building, Snedden ordered {{the construction of a}} new printing facility and office—named the Aurora Building—north of the Chena River. The Alaska Railroad sold Snedden the land for the building, which was built at a cost of $1 million in 1965. Snedden ordered the foundation for the new building to be raised 22 <b>inches</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> 100-year flood line. This fact saved the News-Miner two years later, when a massive flood swept through Fairbanks. The water was three inches deep throughout the paper's offices and even deeper in the press and boiler rooms, which were slightly below that raised level. The flood halted production for a time, and the Anchorage Times reciprocated the post-earthquake favor by publishing the News-Miner's masthead on its editions and posting occasional stories from Fairbanks until electrical power was restored to the town.|$|E

25|$|The flapper {{lifestyle}} and look disappeared in America after the Wall Street Crash {{and the following}} Great Depression. The high-spirited attitude and hedonism were less acceptable during the economic hardships of the 1930s. While hemlines rose, numerous states took action, making laws that restricted women to wear skirts with hemlines no shorter than three <b>inches</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> ankle. The ever-popular bobbed haircut was the cause for some women being fired from their jobs.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{invention}} of defecography, In 1968 Broden and Snellman used cinedefecography to show that rectal prolapse begins as a circumferential intussusception of the rectum, which slowly increases over time. The {{leading edge of the}} intussusceptum may be located at 6–8cm or at 15–18cm from the anal verge. This proved an older theory from the 18th century by John Hunter and Albrecht von Haller that this condition is essentially a full-thickness rectal intussusception, beginning about 3 <b>inches</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> dentate line and protruding externally.|$|E
25|$|Two uniforms were {{prescribed}} {{for women in}} the USNRF. A winter uniform of navy blue serge alternated with a summer uniform of white drill. Both consisted of a single-breasted Norfolk style coat with gilt buttons and a rating badge on the left sleeve, worn over a skirt of the same fabric and shirt waist. The coat had patch pockets on each hip and a belt. The skirt was hemmed to four <b>inches</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> ankle, and the shirt waist was designed to be worn either open at the neck or buttoned. Hats were to be flat-brimmed sailor hats of navy blue felt or straw. Shoes, hose, gloves and a standard Navy neckerchief completed the outfit. Capes were also {{prescribed for}} cold weather.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{being in}} the majority, none of the loyalists put up a {{significant}} struggle once they saw Bligh bound, and the ship was taken over without bloodshed. The mutineers provided Bligh and eighteen loyal crewmen a 23-foot (7m) launch (so heavily loaded that the gunwales {{were only a few}} <b>inches</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> water). They were allowed four cutlasses, food and water for perhaps a week, a quadrant and a compass, but no charts, or marine chronometer. Most of these were obtained by the clerk, Mr Samuel, who acted with great calm and resolution, despite threats from the mutineers. The launch could not hold all the loyal crew members, so four were detained on Bounty for their useful skills; they were later released in Tahiti.|$|E
25|$|A {{few years}} ago there were many {{children}} and men who turned out immediately after a snow-fall, and were daily to be met during the thaw, brushing the crossings as clean as they could. For this small service many foot passengers gladly gave a few small coins, regarding the sweepers not as beggars or vagrants, but as laborers, whose hard and disagreeable work enabled well-shod people to pass neatly on their way. There has, however, been a prohibition of street sweepers...The result is that on Wednesday last...there was not one crossing on which they snow and mud did not come full two <b>inches</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> sole of a thick gaiter, and it was entirely impossible to find a single crossing {{to the opposite side}} of the avenue which could be trod without sinking to the ankle...let us have the volunteer sweepers back for the comfort of a LADY PEDESTRIAN.|$|E
25|$|On January 6, 1994, Harding's main team {{competitor}} Nancy Kerrigan {{was attacked}} by assailant Shane Stant after a practice session at the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Detroit. Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and her bodyguard, Shawn Eckhardt, hired Stant to break Kerrigan's right leg {{so that she would}} be unable to compete at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. After failing to find Kerrigan at her training rink in Massachusetts, Stant followed her to Detroit. When she stepped off the ice after a practice session at Cobo Arena and walked behind a nearby curtain into a corridor, Stant struck her on the thigh a few <b>inches</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> knee with an ASP telescopic baton. Her leg was only bruised, not broken, but the injury forced her to withdraw from the national championship. Harding won that event, and she and Kerrigan were both selected for the 1994 Olympic team. Harding finished eighth in Lillehammer, while Kerrigan, by then fully recovered from the injury, won the silver medal behind Oksana Baiul from Ukraine.|$|E

25|$|Evans {{was back}} in the England team for the 1950/51 Ashes, {{although}} McIntyre did remain in the XI, as a specialist batsman, for the first Test. In the Brisbane match Evans took two noteworthy catches, the first from a Neil Harvey leg glance off the bowling of Alec Bedser, he moved so quickly to the leg side, that according to Neville Cardus, he made the catch look easy. The second dismissal was off the bowling of Freddie Brown, a Sam Loxton cut struck Evans on the gloves and rebounded forward, Evans dived headlong catching the ball <b>inches</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> ground. In the second Test at Melbourne, England were 126/7 in their first innings in response to Australia's 194. Evans, batting at nine, scored 49 which enabled a first innings lead although he failed in the second innings as England unsuccessfully chased 179. Australia won the next two Tests so arrived back at Melbourne for the fifth and final Test with the chance of completing a Whitewash, however this was averted with an eight wicket win by England. This was, at the fourteenth attempt, Evans' first time on the winning side in an Ashes Test. It also marked Australia's first post-war defeat in their 26th Test.|$|E

In a tightly directed, genuinely exciting scene, the monstrous hook sways {{back and forth in}} a direct path toward the camera, making one wonder how cinematographer, Nicholas Musuraca, kept his camera (and head) intact during the shooting. ... The lighting is also used to great advantage, the shadows and fog accenting the terror.

500|$|Hammocks {{are often}} the only dry land within the park. They rise several <b>inches</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> grass-covered river, and are {{dominated}} by diverse plant life consisting of subtropical and tropical trees, such as large southern live oaks (Quercus virginiana). Trees often form canopies under which animals thrive amongst scrub bushes of wild coffee (Psychotria), white indigoberry (Randia aculeata), poisonwood (Metopium toxiferum) and saw palmetto (Serenoa repens). The park features thousands of these tree islands amid sloughs—which often form {{the shape of a}} teardrop when seen from above (see park map) because of the slowly moving water around them—but they can also be found in pineland and mangroves. Trees in the Everglades, including wild tamarind (Lysiloma latisiliquum) and gumbo-limbo (Bursera simaruba), rarely grow higher than [...] due to wind, cold weather, and lightning strikes.|$|E
500|$|These hammocks form on {{slightly}} elevated areas unharmed by deep peat fires or limestone plateaus rising several <b>inches</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> surrounding peat.

Near the bases of hammocks sharp saw palmettos (Serenoa repens) flourish, making the hammocks very difficult to penetrate. Water in sloughs flow around the islands creating moats. Though some ecosystems are maintained and promoted by fire, hammocks may take decades or centuries to recover; the moats are therefore essential for protection. Islands vary in size, but most range between the water slowly flowing around them limits their size and gives them a teardrop appearance from above.

500|$|The {{most common}} form of the flame fougasse was the safety fougasse. This design allowed the {{propelling}} charge to be stored separately until needed. The safety fougasse was constructed as follows: a small section was excavated from the side of a slope, leaving a shallow platform of earth, and a barrel of incendiary mixture was placed horizontally in a low position with one round face pointing towards the target. At the back, a section of stove or drain pipe was placed vertically against the rear face of the barrel. The lower end of the pipe was blocked off with a thin cover and positioned a few <b>inches</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the barrel. The top of the pipe was fitted with a loose cap to keep water out. This pipe is what makes it a [...] "safety" [...] fougasse because it allows later installation of the propelling charge.

500|$|The steamer {{which had}} {{collided}} with Arctic was , an iron-hulled propeller-driven French ship {{used by a}} major fishing operator to ferry its employees to and from their center of operations at Saint Pierre Island, Newfoundland. To those on Arctics deck, Vesta appeared to be fatally damaged; Luce thought her bows [...] "seemed to be literally cut or crushed off for full ten feet". [...] His first reaction, believing his own ship almost untouched, was to assist Vesta, on which scenes of panic and chaos among the 200-odd sailors and fishermen aboard her were evident. He ordered his chief officer, Robert Gourlay, to lower one of Arctics six lifeboats with a crew of six, and to ascertain what help could be offered; meanwhile, Arctic slowly circled the stricken vessel. Gourlay's boat was quickly away, and another was prepared for launching, under second officer William Baalham, but before this could be done Luce rescinded the order. He had noticed {{a change in the}} movement of Arctics paddle wheels through the water [...] and saw also that the ship was listing, signs [...] of potentially serious damage. [...] Baalham was ordered to make a closer inspection of the point of impact; he found that debris from Vestas iron stem and anchor were impaled in the woodwork of Arctics hull, creating substantial holes about eighteen <b>inches</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> water-line. Two breaches were below the waterline, admitting large quantities of water. Unlike Vesta, Arctic was not equipped with watertight compartments; the hull was open from stem to stern.|$|E
