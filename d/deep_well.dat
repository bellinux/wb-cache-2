5|$|Steam is {{provided}} by an elderly Marshall portable boiler– essentially a portable engine without the actual engine. It was built in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire in 1938 before being used by Thames Water as a stand by steam generator. It was given to Kew Bridge Steam Museum (now the London Museum of Water & Steam) before being {{passed on to the}} Westonzoyland Museum and then restored with a grant from the Preservation of Industrial and Scientific Materials Foundation (PRISM). The boiler provides steam at 50 Pounds per square inch (psi) to the other exhibits. It has been fitted with two whistles, one from Wattstown and the other from Ty Mawr Collieries in Wales, both of which were donated by the National Coal Board. Along with the boiler in the outdoor courtyard area are a waterwheel pump unit built by G. H. Harris of Wadebridge, a Lee Howl pump and Lister <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> pump.|$|E
5|$|The Dove Street Festival of Lights – Begun 1990, the Dove Street Festival of Lights {{takes place}} each December. It began when a local {{family on the}} street adopted their {{daughter}} and wanted to dedicate an event to her. Local families on Dove street decorated the entire street with holiday lights, connecting the homes {{together to create a}} light tunnel effect. Previously, the Glee Club of the Miami University of Ohio serenaded residents with holiday songs. Town volunteers collect donations of money, food and toys at the festival that are given to The <b>Deep</b> <b>Well</b> Project, a local charity. In recent years the festival has moved from the original Dove Street to Shelter Cove Lane where the town can assist in the electrical costs.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{persistent}} rumours of a treasure hidden by Richard II {{somewhere in the}} castle grounds. Richard {{is supposed to have}} hidden part of his personal wealth at Beeston on his journey to Chester in 1399, before boarding a ship to Ireland to suppress a rebellion there. On his return, Richard was deposed by Henry, Duke of Lancaster, the future Henry IV, and his treasure is said to have remained undiscovered. Many searches have been carried out, most of them focusing on the <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> in the inner bailey, but nothing has ever been found. The rumour of hidden treasure may not be well-founded, as Henry IV is recorded as having recovered Richard's gold and jewellery from its various hiding places.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days, houses were wooden boards fronted by a four-board-high fence which was fronted with a boardwalk. Most {{of the streets}} were dirt roads. Winters were bitterly cold, and teams of horses {{dragging}} V-shaped wooden plows cleared the streets. In {{the center of town}} was the community pump, from which the village would draw water at stipulated hours. Water was pumped from the mine twice a day through a big open pipe. Everyone had to carry water home during pumping time. There was no shutoff valve, so buckets, tubs and barrels were used for water storage. Later, a water tower was built to hold water drawn from a <b>deep</b> <b>well.</b> St. Bernard dogs helped carry the water from the well to the homes. Running water and bathtubs came only after ditches were dug for pipes to provide water from Gilbert around 1916. Kerosene lamps provided the means of lighting until 1916, when power lines were installed. Initially, the only telephone was at the Elba mine office.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the UTW {{expected}} to have this much success so easily and so quickly in the South; it had only shallow roots and few regular organizers in that region.

25|$|Almost {{the entire}} portion of Quezon is {{classified}} as <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> area with {{a small portion of}} barangay Barucboc, having the lowest point of elevation in the entire municipality, belonging in the shallow area. Quezon s underlain with sedimentary rock formations the dominant being recent depositions of alluvium. This covers much of the municipality except in the Barucboc-Estrada area which is underlain with sandstone. The unconsolidated nature of the sandstone layers in these areas could account for the relatively shallow depth to the water data, since in general sandstones’ permeability allow good infiltration of water.|$|E

25|$|Based on the study, Quezon is {{classified}} {{into two categories}} namely: deep and shallow well areas. Shallow well areas generally consist of recent formations with slopes ranging from zero to three percent. Most of these areas are located at elevations within 50 meters above mean sea level, like alluvial and coastal plains and river valleys. Shallow wells may also have deep-water aquifer and are less susceptible to salt water intrusion. <b>Deep</b> <b>well</b> areas generally consist of sedimentary formations, 90 percent of which are water carriers, These are usually located in slopes reaching up to 10%, usually at elevations of more than 50 meters above sea level. The waters from deep wells are in general, of good quality.|$|E
25|$|In 1940 Mickey {{appeared}} in his first feature-length film, Fantasia. His screen role as The Sorcerer's Apprentice, set to the symphonic poem {{of the same name}} by Paul Dukas, is perhaps the most famous segment of the film and one of Mickey's most iconic roles. The segment features no dialogue at all, only the music. The apprentice (Mickey), not willing to do his chores, puts on the sorcerer's magic hat after the sorcerer goes to bed and casts a spell on a broom, which causes the broom to come to life and perform the most tiring chore—filling up a <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> using two buckets of water. When the well eventually overflows, Mickey finds himself unable to control the broom, leading to a near-flood. After the segment ends, Mickey is seen in silhouette shaking hands with Leopold Stokowski, who conducts all the music heard in Fantasia. Mickey has often been pictured in the red robe and blue sorcerer's hat in merchandising. It was also featured into the climax of Fantasmic!, an attraction at the Disney theme parks.|$|E
25|$|Oversight of the {{construction}} has been credited by various sources to either master masons John Box or Henry Yevele, or to William of Wykeham. The work required some 1,600 craftsmen and labourers, and was completed by about 1367 {{at a cost of}} some £20,000. The castle was built to a radical concentric design, the first of its type to be built in England. It consisted of a large circular building, described as a rotunda or shell keep, buttressed by six projecting towers and having a central circular courtyard. This main building was surrounded by an outer circular curtain wall and a moat. It is possible that the design was influenced by that of Bellver Castle, which had been built in Majorca between 1300 and 1311 for King James II of Majorca. Queenborough {{was one of the first}} English castles built to withstand siege artillery and to mount guns itself, and the last royal castle to be built in England during the Late Middle Ages. Originally, water was channelled from the roofs through lead piping into storage cisterns, but in 1393 a contractor spent sixty weeks digging a <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> in the centre of the courtyard.|$|E

500|$|The castle {{was built}} on Long Hill, a chalk ridge {{overlooking}} the village; the hill was flattened and scarped, with a [...] deep ditch cut into the west side. As archaeologist Phil Mcmahon describes, documentary sources imply the castle was [...] "a rectangular stone-built structure with six towers, incorporating a hall, an inner and outer gate, a <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> and a chapel", {{and it may have}} resembled a smaller version of Framlingham Castle. The castle was probably entered from the west, with a possible road running up {{the south side of the}} hill. At the same time the village was expanded into a planned town with an unofficial market. The castle was renovated in 1300, possibly in response to the threat of rebellion in England at the time.|$|E
500|$|The Larrys Creek {{watershed}} has two {{deposits of}} low volatile bituminous coal along Roaring Run and a small, deep natural gas field. A potentially large source {{of natural gas}} is the Marcellus Shale, which lies [...] below the surface here and stretches from New York through Pennsylvania to Ohio and West Virginia. Estimates of the total natural gas in the black shale from the Devonian era range from 168 to 516trillion cubic feet (4.76 to 14.6trillionm3), with at least 10 percent considered recoverable. In November 2007, drilling within the Larrys Creek watershed started in Mifflin Township, just west of Salladasburg, with a [...] <b>deep</b> <b>well.</b> A second well was drilled in Mifflin Township in December 2007, and by February 2008 every well drilled in Lycoming County was producing natural gas.

500|$|During {{the second}} season, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Tyrion {{is just about}} the only {{character}} developing any complexity.

[...] Emily Nussbaum of The New Yorker noted, [...] "If the show has a hero, it's Tyrion (Dinklage), who is capable of cruelty but also possesses insight and empathy, concealed beneath a carapace of Wildean wit." [...] The Hollywood Reporter called Tyrion [...] "the one to watch, as he's the smartest Lannister and knows that having a brat for a king – who mistreats all those around him – could cause major backlash." [...] Willa Paskin of Salon called the character's increased prominence in Season 2 [...] "a trade up in entertainment value, and a trade-off in morality." [...] She added, [...] "Tyrion is more cynical, more manipulative and much better suited to surviving. He's not so keen to be made into meat, and that makes him the kind of man characters in the show and audience members alike should be investing in." [...] Praising Dinklage, Dan Kois of The New York Times wrote, [...] "He plays Tyrion as the only modern man in a muddy, violent, primal world. He loves good food, good conversation and a good book. Unlike the warmongering lords and knights of Westeros, but like most HBO subscribers, he would prefer to stay out of battle." [...] Kois adds that, [...] "Dinklage's bravado masks Tyrion's <b>deep</b> <b>well</b> of melancholy." [...] Of the Season 2 storyline, Dinklage noted that Tyrion enjoys not only his foray into battle, but also his new and unprecedented power at court. He said, [...] "This is a character that's been shit upon his whole life. I mean, he comes from great wealth, but he's treated very poorly, so now there's a newfound respect where if somebody calls him a name, he can have them killed. He never had that before. Tyrion definitely enjoys that part and he's trying desperately to hold onto it. He's enjoying it while it lasts 'cause he's not sure it's gonna last very long." [...] As Varys the Spymaster tells Tyrion, power is [...] "a trick, a shadow on the wall ... and a very small man can cast a very large shadow." ...|$|E
