60|$|Sophy Gerard said nothing. <b>Her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> pink with excitement.|$|E
60|$|She hesitated. <b>Her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> flushed. She drew {{herself up}} proudly.|$|E
60|$|Amenche said nothing, but <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> {{flushed with}} {{excitement}} and pleasure.|$|E
60|$|The tears glittered in Marian's eyes, and <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>was</b> flushed.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she found}} that the pillow beneath <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>was</b> wet with <b>her</b> tears.|$|R
60|$|Gudrun's eyes <b>were</b> flashing, <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>was</b> hot, {{she looked}} strange, exotic, satiric. Ursula was fascinated at once--and yet uneasy.|$|R
60|$|Anna stood up. <b>Her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> aflame. Her {{eyes were}} lit with {{smouldering}} passion.|$|E
60|$|Her eyes fell. It was too absurd at her age, but <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> burning.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him steadily. <b>Her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> a little whiter, but her tone was deliberate.|$|E
60|$|He {{saw that}} her eyelashes were still wet, the pillow by <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>was</b> wet. <b>Her</b> white, tear-stained face hurt him....|$|R
60|$|As a pomegranate, cut in twain, White-seeded, is her crimson mouth, <b>Her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>are</b> as {{the fading}} stain Where the peach reddens to the south.|$|R
6000|$|Was never a Maid in Waldhurst's walls [...] Might {{match with}} Margaret, <b>Her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>was</b> fair, <b>her</b> eyes were dark, [...] Her silken locks like jet.|$|R
60|$|Ellen {{was looking}} at that moment {{positively}} handsome. <b>Her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> scarlet and her eyes ablaze.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> flushed, {{her lips}} tremulous, but she {{continued}} to look him frankly in the eyes.|$|E
60|$|Her {{lips were}} drawn in tight silence, and in <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> little angry spots of blood.|$|E
6000|$|Then <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>was</b> {{pale and}} thinner than {{should be for}} one so young, [...] And her eyes on all my motions with a mute {{observance}} hung.|$|R
6000|$|Upstairs in her room, Ethel Lennox, {{with a few}} undried tears glistening on <b>her</b> <b>cheeks,</b> <b>was</b> {{writing a}} letter. Her lips were {{compressed}} and her hand trembled: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please {{carry me}} in," [...] said the Sea Lady, {{closing her eyes}} as if she <b>were</b> ill--though <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>was</b> flushed and warm. [...] "Carry me in." ...|$|R
60|$|Anna {{rose to her}} feet. At {{last she}} was roused. <b>Her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> flushed, and her eyes bright.|$|E
60|$|He looked {{towards her}} marvelling. <b>Her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> prettily flushed, {{and she walked}} with the {{delightful}} springiness of perfect health.|$|E
60|$|A {{touch on}} his sleeve startled him. Antonia was leaning forward; <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> crimson above the pallor of her neck.|$|E
60|$|He {{caught up}} his stick and hat, and {{followed}} her. Then {{he saw that}} the color in <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>was</b> not wholly natural. She was nervous and excited.|$|R
5000|$|The 5 {{digit number}} on <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>is</b> unique to each user who {{purchases}} the magazine. However, {{according to an}} official Twitter message, her official number is [...] "00001".|$|R
6000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>are</b> like yon crimson gem, [...] The {{pride of}} all the flowery scene, [...] Just opening on its thorny stem; [...] An' she has twa {{sparkling}} roguish een.|$|R
60|$|She took it smilingly. But <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> {{white as}} paper, {{and her eyes}} black as drops of ink, with anger.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked me}} in the face. <b>Her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> flushed with walking, and the wind had blown her hair into {{becoming}} confusion.|$|E
60|$|She sat down, panting, on the tussocky grass. <b>Her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> flushed pink. He kissed her, and {{she gave}} way to joy.|$|E
60|$|Mabel {{dropped her}} hands, arose, and stood {{face to face}} with her two suitors, though the flush that <b>was</b> on <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>was</b> feverish, the {{evidence}} of excitement rather than of shame.|$|R
60|$|Her eyelids were hot, heavy, {{and thick}} with {{excessive}} weeping, and the delicate rose-red of <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>was</b> disfigured and inflamed {{by the constant}} chafing of the handkerchief in wiping her many tears.|$|R
60|$|Lor. She is of {{a middle}} stature, dark-coloured hair, the most bewitching leer with her eyes, the most roguish cast! <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>are</b> dimpled when she smiles, and her smiles would tempt an hermit.|$|R
60|$|She stopped. She gave a gasp {{as she saw}} Alec's face. Though <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> pale before, {{now their}} pallor was deathly.|$|E
60|$|He was {{surprised}} to see that <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> burning and her eyes were wet. He laid his hand tenderly upon her arm.|$|E
60|$|She hesitated; but Lucy {{chose not}} to finish the sentence. She had been pale; but <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>were</b> now like the rose, again.|$|E
60|$|In her terror her {{own hands}} clasped about the man's neck. <b>Her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>was</b> close to his. Death, unseen and of unknown form, seemed close upon them, and because unseen and unknowable {{infinitely}} more terrifying.|$|R
60|$|The {{woman looked}} at him angrily. Without her veil she {{displayed}} features not in themselves unattractive, but a complexion somewhat impaired {{by the use of}} cosmetics. The powder upon <b>her</b> <b>cheeks</b> <b>was</b> even then visible.|$|R
6000|$|He saw {{the words}} reach her brain, and that wild look waver. Stretching out his arm, he drew her {{close to him}} till <b>her</b> <b>cheek</b> <b>was</b> against his, <b>her</b> shaking body against him, and kept murmuring: ...|$|R
