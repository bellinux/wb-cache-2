The presence of osteomalacia was strongly related to varying degrees of vegetarianism. Lactovegetarianism (no meat, fish or egg consumption) was associated with significantly greater osteomalacic risk than ovolactovegetarianism (no meat or fish consumption). Unlike Asian rickets, high-extraction wheat cereal as chapatti {{was not a significant}} risk factor for osteomalacia in Asian women and dietary fibre was a less important risk factor than absent dietary meat, fish or egg.

5000|$|In photography, {{the sunny}} 16 rule (also {{known as the}} sunny [...] rule) is a method of {{estimating}} correct <b>daylight</b> <b>exposures</b> without a light meter. (For lunar photography there is a similar rule known as the looney 11 rule.) Apart from the obvious advantage of independence from a light meter, the sunny 16 rule can also aid in achieving correct exposure of difficult subjects. As the rule is based on incident light, rather than reflected light as with most camera light meters, very bright or very dark subjects are compensated for. The rule serves as a mnemonic for the camera settings obtained {{on a sunny day}} using the exposure value (EV) system.|$|R
40|$|The light-induced {{brightness}} reversion {{of different}} types of unbleached and bleached high-yield pulps was studied under both accelerated and long-term ambient light-induced ageing conditions. It was found that accelerated ageing conditions that mimic indoor <b>daylight</b> <b>exposures</b> overestimate the yellowing tendencies of hardwood high-yield pulps (especially aspen pulps) compared to long-term ambient aging with no indirect sunlight present. It was, however, possible to predict the yellowing characteristics of softwood high-yield pulps. The lignin content of the pulps was found to be strongly correlated with the degree of photo-yellowing in the case of long-term ambient light-induced ageing. The presence of small amounts of birch chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP) in a fine paper furnish resulted in extensive light-induced discoloration. The extent of photo-yellowing was found to be nearly linearly related to the amount of birch CTMP in the paper.

However, on most chemical film, such an exposure would turn out too dark. This is because film does not expose in linear proportion to the light it absorbs, an effect called reciprocity failure. At light levels as dim as moonlight, it needs more light than a linear extrapolation of daylight values would suggest.|$|E
50|$|A study {{conducted}} in 1972 and 1981, documented by Robert Ulrich, surveyed 23 surgical patients assigned to rooms looking {{out on a}} natural scene. The study concluded that patients assigned to rooms with windows allowing lots of natural light had shorter postoperative hospital stays, received fewer negative evaluative comments in nurses’ notes, and took fewer potent analegesics than 23 matched patients in similar rooms with windows facing a brick wall. This study suggests that {{due to the nature}} of the scenery and <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure</b> was indeed healthier for patients as opposed to those exposed to little light from the brick wall.

40|$|Regional {{variation}} in the prevalence of Asian rickets was examined in Coventry, Bradford and Glasgow. Records of 152 weeks of <b>daylight</b> outdoor <b>exposure</b> were obtained from 104 Glasgow Asian children, 53 {{of whom had been}} treated for rickets. Records of seven-day weighed dietary intake were obtained from 84 Asian children, 43 of whom had been treated for rickets. There was a marked north-south gradient in the prevalence of Asian rickets. In all cases of severe rickets with deformity the child was vegetarian. Severe rickets was associated with lower intake of meat, higher intake of chapati and lower <b>daylight</b> outdoor <b>exposure</b> values than in normal children. Multivariate analysis employing a combination of these variables provided good separation between rachitic and normal groups. A risk-factor model is proposed which suggests that regional {{variation in}} the prevalence of rickets among Asian communities in Britain is mainly determined by the effects of latitude {{and the nature of the}} urban environment on available ultraviolet radiation. Where UV radiation is restricted, individual propensity to rickets within a given Asian community is mainly determined by dietary factors...|$|R

Stars are rarely seen in Space Shuttle, Mir, Earth observation photos, or even sporting events that take place at night. The light from the Sun in outer space in the Earth-Moon system {{is at least as}} bright as the sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface on a clear day at noon, so cameras used for imaging subjects illuminated by sunlight are set for a <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure.</b> The dim light of the stars simply do not provide enough exposure to record visible images. (This effect can be demonstrated on Earth by attempting to view stars from a brightly lit parking lot at night. Only a few of the brightest stars are visible, and shielding the eye with one's hands only marginally improves the view. Science fiction films and television shows do confuse this issue by depicting stars as visible in space under all lighting conditions. A photographic demonstration of how aperture and shutter speed can turn a lit background ink-black is here. The eye's visual response is much the same.) Stars were seen by every Apollo mission crew except for Apollo 13. (An oxygen tank explosion in the Apollo 13 Service Module two days after launch prevented the crew from clearly seeing stars due to a haze of oxygen and water vapor surrounding the spacecraft.) Stars were used for navigation purposes and were occasionally also seen through cabin windows when the conditions allowed. To see stars, nothing lit by sunlight could be in the viewer's field of view.|$|E

In sunny countries, such as Nigeria, South Africa, and Bangladesh, where the disease occurs among older toddlers and children, it has been attributed to low dietary calcium intakes, which are characteristic of cereal-based diets with limited access to dairy products. Rickets was formerly a major public health problem among the US population; in Denver, where ultraviolet rays are about 20% stronger than at sea level on the same latitude, almost two-thirds of 500 children had mild rickets in the late 1920s. An increase in the proportion of animal protein in the 20th-century American diet coupled with increased consumption of milk fortified with relatively small quantities of vitamin D coincided with a dramatic {{decline in the number of}} rickets cases.|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT:Melatonin is {{involved}} in a variety of diseases, including cancer, insomnia, depression, dementia, hypertension, and diabetes; its secretion is influenced by environmental light. Although <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure</b> increases nocturnal melatonin secretion in a controlled laboratory setting, whether it increases nocturnal melatonin secretion in an uncontrolled daily life setting remains unclear. OBJECTIVE:We aimed to determine the association between <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure</b> in an uncontrolled daily life setting and urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin excretion. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS:A cross-sectional study was conducted in 192 elderly individuals (mean age, 69. 9 yr). MEASURES:We measured ambulatory <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure</b> using a wrist light meter in two 48 -h sessions; furthermore, we measured overnight urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin excretion, an index of melatonin secretion, on the second night of each session. RESULTS:The median duration of <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure</b> of at least 1000 lux was 72 min (interquartile range, 37 - 124). Univariate linear regression analysis showed marginal to significant associations between log-transformed urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin excretion and age, current smoking status, benzodiazepine use, day length, log-transformed duration of <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure</b> of at least 1000 lux, and daytime physical activity. In a multivariate model, log-transformed duration of <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure</b> of at least 1000 lux was significantly associated with log-transformed urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin excretion (regression coefficient, 0. 101; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 003 - 0. 199; P = 0. 043). Furthermore, an increase in the duration of <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure</b> of at least 1000 lux from 37 to 124 min (25 th to 75 th percentiles) was associated with a 13. 0 % increase in urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin excretion (6. 8 to 7. 7 μg). CONCLUSIONS:Daylight exposure in an uncontrolled daily life setting is positively associated with urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin excretion in the elderly. 博士（医学）・乙第 1308 号・平成 25 年 3 月 15 日Copyright © 2012 by The Endocrine Societ...|$|E

40|$|Interest in {{the optical}} {{luminescence}} dating (OSL) of rock surfaces has increased signifi- cantly {{over the last}} few years, as the potential of the method has been realised. In this study we investigate the information available in blue-stimulated luminescence depth pro- files into the surfaces of 4 quartz-rich cobbles from a Neanderthal site (Les Roches d’Abilly) in western France, and IR stimulated luminescence depth profile from a feldspar-rich gran- ite whetstone from an Iron Age villages near Aarhus in Denmark. These profiles show qualitative evidence for multiple <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure</b> and burial events. To quantify both burial and <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure</b> events a new model is developed. The existing model de- scribing the evolution of luminescence depth profiles is expanded to include burial before and after light exposure, and the possibility of repeated sequential <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure</b> and burial events. By determining the burial ages from the surface layers of the cobbles and by investigating the fitted luminescence profile, it is concluded that all cobbles were ap- parently well bleached before burial. This indicates that the estimated burial ages are reliable. In all cases the burial age of the most recent burial event is consistent with the expected age (quartz OSL on sediments from Les Roches d’Abilly and archaeological con- text for the Aarhus site). In addition, a recent known <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure</b> event provides an approximate calibration for <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure</b> events. This study thus confirms the suggestion that rock surfaces contain a record of daylight and burial history. Rock surfaces can therefore be dated with confidence, and {{it may be possible to}} determine a <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure</b> history using a known natural light exposure as calibration. Besides developing and applying the mathematical model, a preparation method for the samples used in this study has been developed. This development was based on knowledge of the chemical structure and properties of quartz and feldspar, together with X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements of full rock slices before and after chemical treatment. It is concluded that, in order to extract pure quartz grains from the French samples, hydrogen chloride (HCl) should be added before etching with hydroflouric acid (HF). If HCl is not used first to remove calcium carbonate from the rock slices, HF can not attack and remove feldspar grains. It is also shown that the absence of feldspar in XRF analysis does not necessarily indicate that there is no infrared luminescence sensitivity, indicating that feldspar has not been completely removed...|$|E

The photocatalytic effect of titanium dioxide on the carbonation of nanolime and its influence on the degradation processes in polluted environments is assessed. A suspension of 25  g/l of nanolime in ethanol and 7. 4 % wt/vol titanium dioxide was applied to specimens of Bath stone. For comparison, additional specimens were treated only with the nanolime.

Nanolime and the photocatalytic nanolime coatings were shown to promote the reaction of SO 2.

40|$|The {{majority}} of investigations that have measured sediment properties related to intertidal sediment stability have been undertaken during <b>daylight</b> subaerial <b>exposure</b> periods. As a consequence, models based upon such data represent only partially the intertidal flat surface conditions within any 24 h period. In this contribution, a comparison is made between surface sediment properties related to sediment stability measured during six consecutive (day/night), semi-diurnal subaerial exposure periods, at three stations on an intertidal sand flat in late March 1999. The study site was selected {{on the basis}} of its suitability for sampling and data collection at night, with special regard to safety and logistics. Seawater temperatures ranged from 4. 1 to 9. 6 [deg]C, and salinities from 33. 9 to 34. 8. Eleven parameters related to intertidal flat sediment stability were measured, or derived. These variables included the critical erosion shear stress ([tau]c), chlorophyll a, phaeopigment, and colloidal carbohydrate content, mean grain size and settling velocity of the surface (0 - 1 mm) sediment fraction. Bed elevation was described using an acretion/erosion parameter (AEP) (West and West 1991), whilst additional physical terms included ambient seawater salinity and temperature, as well as tidal range and wind speed, during the preceding immersion periods. One-way ANOVA was used to detect significant differences between day- and night-time emersion periods; similarly, principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to detect continuous variation between properties. The results show a high degree of temporal and spatial variability between day- and night-time intertidal flat variables, the PCA differentiating clearly between day and night conditions. Surface sediments across the intertidal flat exhibited varying degrees of biostabilisation. The maximum biostabilisation coefficient (18) was recorded at night in high microalgal biomass areas; the minimum (5) occurred during both day and night, in areas with lower microalgal biomass. All surface sediment parameters varied rhythmically between day- and night-time. Significant differences were found between day- and night-time biostabilisation coefficients, however, differences between day- and night-time [tau]c values were not detected. It is suggested that sediment stability at night is enhanced in high microalgal biomass areas as a result of degradation products from bound extra-cellular polysaccharides (EPS) not easily detected using standard extraction procedure...|$|R
40|$|The {{intertidal}} reef flat of Barang Lompo Island, Indonesia, {{is exposed}} to air for several hours per day on the days around spring tides. The time of exposure shows a seasonal pattern. In the period January-June, the reef flat only runs dry at night, whereas in the period July-December, exposure only occurs during daylight. During the low tide <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure</b> period of July-December 1993, the leaf and rhizome biomasses (g m(- 2)) declined significantly by 61 and 37 %, respectively. Total rhizome length remained unchanged. C- and P-concentrations (% of dry weight) of leaves showed no change, while the leaf N- concentration increased by 25 %. C-, N- and P-contents of leaves showed a decline that was strongly correlated to leaf biomass decline. In the rhizomes, C-concentration declined by 8 %, but the N- and P-concentrations increased by 111 and 25 %, respectively. Rhizome C-content (g m(- 2)) declined (43 %), N- content increased (46 %) and P-content did not change. Total C- and P-contents of the summed biomass of leaves and rhizomes declined by 46 and 34 %, respectively, but N-content showed no change. Ammonium and phosphate concentrations {{in the water column}} and pore water phosphate were not significantly different during <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure</b> compared to during nocturnal exposure. Ammonium concentration in the pore water, however, was 1. 6 times higher during <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure.</b> Results show that during a period of frequent <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure,</b> the nutrient status in the intertidal Thalassia hemprichii seagrass bed changed considerably. Despite biomass reduction, the total nitrogen content in leaves and rhizomes together was constant, which was achieved by an enhanced nitrogen accumulation in the rhizomes. Two theories possibly responsible for the stable sum of the total leaf and rhizome nitrogen content are discussed. The first theory describes the seagrass bed as a relatively closed system with respect to nutrient cycles: detached leaf fragments remain trapped within the meadow. The second theory postulates that the loss of part of the photosynthesising canopy due to <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure</b> has a series of consequences for microbial N-transformation processes in the sediment, which indirectly affects the plants' nitrogen status. This study shows that Thalassia hemprichii, covering the reef flat of an intertidal tropical offshore coral island, which is often considered as a nutrient-poor environment, is rather resilient to a significant canopy die-off and concomitant nutrient losses.

40|$|Provision of {{daylighting}} {{and external}} view in hospitals is crucial as {{they create a}} positive healing environment. They could help in reducing patient stress, fatigue and length of stay, while increasing patient and staff safety and satisfaction. However, in desert locations that are typically characterized by year-long clear skies, control of solar penetration is essential. Window blinds were used to decrease patients’ visual discomfort and improve illuminance levels. The shape of blind slats influences <b>daylighting</b> performance and <b>exposure</b> to external view. The objective {{of this paper was}} to identify the shapes of horizontal blind slats that best suit a common hospital patient room layout design under the predominantly clear-sky of Cairo, Egypt. The paper utilized parametric tools and simulation software to systematically test possible slat shapes. A total of 77 slat shapes were examined. The objective was to fulfill year-round daylighting adequacy on the bed surface and the room area, and to maximize patient’s access to external view. The shading system examined in this paper was an internal horizontal blind that looks similar to Venetian blinds, but fixed with no movement. The shape of all slats of the tested blinds was simultaneously adjusted for examination. The effect of changing slat shapes was examined by evaluating daylighting performance in terms of Spatial Daylight Autonomy (sDA) and Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE) on both the bed surface and the room surface planes. Exposure to external view, expressed as External View Factor (EVF) was also addressed. The two tips of each slat were kept fixed in position. The position of an intermediate point on the slat surface was systematically adjusted in the horizontal and vertical directions creating curved blind slat shapes. Results revealed that the sDA on the room surface plane was the limiting factor in determining acceptable slat shapes. The range of acceptable slat shapes according to the sDA on the bed surface criterion was larger than that of the whole room area. In addition, all tested slat shapes provided acceptable ASE performance. Blinds with flat or gently curved slat shapes scored better results in both daylighting and external view exposure. Position of the intermediate point of the slat – in most of the accepted cases – fell in a narrow vertical range around the horizontal base line. Changing the position of the intermediate point horizontally in either direction resulted in a marginal effect on the performance of the accepted cases.

Hypotheses regarding the apparent rarity of such defenses have emphasized the potential incompatibility of actively developing tissues and toxic metabolites. Alternatively, this apparent pattern could be an artifact of our greater knowledge of vertebrates, which in general show few tendencies for synthesizing defensive metabolites in either juvenile or adult stages. In this study, we investigated adult and larval chemical defenses of a group of benthic marine invertebrates, the ascidians, in which the adults are often chemically rich, and we contrast our findings with what is known about chemical defenses of eggs and embryos from terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Our findings suggest that there is no fundamental incompatibility of rapidly developing juvenile tissues and bioactive metabolites, and that chemically defended eggs and larval stages may be common among some taxonomic groups. Ascidians are benthic invertebrates that often lack apparent physical defenses against predation, yet are common on coral reefs where predation by fishes is intense. In contrast to most co—occurring invertebrates, many ascidians also release large, conspicuous larvae during <b>daylight</b> hours when <b>exposure</b> to fish predation would be highest. Thus selection by predators might favor the evolution of distasteful larvae. In situ observations indicate that many conspicuous ascidian larvae are distasteful to potential consumers. We investigated the ability of secondary metabolites produced by taxonomically diverse ascidians from geographically distant locales to deter predation on both adults and larvae. Larvae from the Caribbean ascidian Trididemnum solidum were distasteful to reef fishes, and when organic extracts of individual larvae were transferred onto eyes of freeze—dried krill (a good larval mimic in terms of size and color), these eyes were rejected by fishes while control eyes (solvent only) were readily eaten. Larvae of the Indo—Pacific ascidian Sigillina cf. signifera were also distasteful to coral—reef fishes and contained the unpalatable bipyrrole alkaloid tambjamine C. When added to artificial foods at or below their natural mean concentrations and offered to consumers in field and laboratory feeding assays, the secondary metabolites produced by Trididemnum solidum (Caribbean Sea), Sigillina cf. signifera (Indo—Pacific), and Polyandrocarpa sp. (Gulf of California) significantly deterred feeding by co—occurring fishes and invertebrates. Secondary metabolites produced by Trididemnum cf. cyanophorum from the Caribbean Sea, Lissoclinum patella from the Indo—Pacific, and Aplidium californicum from the temperate Pacific, and the small stellate spicules common to many tropical didemnid ascidians did not significantly affect fish feeding. High—pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses of six didemnin cyclic peptides in individual colonies of Trididemnum solidum from one patch reef at Little San Salvador, Bahamas found large inter—colony differences in their concentrations. The mean concentration of didemnin B was more than double the concentration needed to significantly deter fish feeding in our field assays, and feeding tests with nordidemnin B showed that it deterred fish feeding across the entire range of natural concentrations. HPLC analysis of the extract from a combined collection of T. solidum larvae found adequate concentrations of didemnin B and nordidemnin B to account for their rejection by foraging fishes. We demonstrate that taxonomically diverse ascidians from habitats characterized by intense predation pressure produce secondary metabolites that significantly reduce predation on both adults and larvae, and suggest that this defensive chemistry may be crucial in allowing the release of large, well—provisioned larvae during daylight periods when larvae have the greatest probability of using photic cues to select physically appropriate settlement sites. Production of defensive secondary metabolites appears widespread among certain groups of ascidians, some of which are also known to concentrate acid and heavy metals as additional defensive strategies...|$|R
30|$|Introduction: Delirium is {{frequent}} {{in intensive}} care unit (ICU) patients and is associated with increased mortality, increased hospital stay, increased cost and long term cognitive impairment in survivors. Numerous pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies have been investigated for delirium treatment without success. Therefore delirium prevention strategies are recommended by current critical care practice guidelines. Among the potentially modifiable risk factors for delirium, the impact of <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure</b> on delirium incidence and or duration has not been studied. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate whether daylight exposition would reduce delirium burden in critically ill patients.|$|E
40|$|Background. Although a host {{of factors}} are known to {{influence}} 25 -hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH) D] serum levels, few studies addressed the distinctive sex-specific influence of aging, and the age-specific relationship of parathyroid hormone (PTH) with 25 (OH) D. The aims of this research were to evaluate changes of 25 (OH) D and PTH levels with age in a large population-based sample {{of men and women}} and to test the hypothesis that 25 (OH) D serum concentrations needed to offset age-associated hyperparathyroidism are significantly higher in older than in younger persons. Methods. In 1107 participants of the InCHIANTI (Invecchiare in Chianti, i. e., Aging in the Chianti area) study, we collected information on dietary intake, <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure,</b> and disability, and measured renal function and serum 25 (OH) D and PTH. Results. In women, the age-related decline of 25 (OH) D was already evident shortly after age 50, whereas in men it started only after age 70 and was substantially less steep. Age, <b>daylight</b> <b>exposure,</b> winter season, and disability were independent predictors of low 25 (OH) D levels. For any given level of 25 (OH) D, PTH levels were progressively and consistently higher in older than in younger participants. Conclusions. These findings suggest that the age-associated fall of serum 25 (OH) D starts earlier in women than in men and that higher levels of 25 (OH) D are required in older compared to younger persons to avoid the age-associated compensatory hyperparathyroidism...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. Objective: The World Health Organization (WHO) {{requested}} the Research Institute for Industrial Pharmacy, at the North-West University, Potchefstroom, South Africa, to develop monographs for anti-tuberculosis products for The International Pharmacopoeia (IntPh). These included monographs for rifampicin capsules; rifampicin tablets; isoniazid and ethambutol hydrochloride tablets; rifampicin and isoniazid tablets; rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide tablets; and rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol hydrochloride tablets. Background: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is an airborne disease that mainly affects the lungs. TB is currently causing a global health emergency and {{is among the}} principal killers of HIV infected people. First line anti-tuberculosis medicines include the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin. The WHO recommends the use of fixed dose combination products (FDCs) {{for the treatment of}} TB and multi-drug resistant TB. In the development of monographs, {{it is important to consider}} the safety, efficacy, and in particular the quality requirements for FDC products, which comprise stability, assay and identification testing, as well as the determination of degradation products / related substances. Comprehensive guidelines on FDCs, as published by the WHO, were applied in this study. Chemical and physical compatibility of APIs in an FDC, the degradability of each API under conditions of stress when in combination with other APIs, as well as API-excipient incompatibility, are important considerations for FDCs and their specifications. The reaction between isoniazid and rifampicin to form 3 -(isonicotinoylhydrazinomethyl) rifamycin (commonly known as the isonicotinyl hydrazone, or rif-iso hydrazone) is particularly important, as this could result in a loss of therapeutic activity of rifampicin, that could lead to reduced bioavailability, poor patient compliance and subsequently failure to cure TB. Experimental procedure: Methods were developed for identity, assay and related substances testing. Although not requested by the WHO, it was decided to develop a dissolution test for isoniazid and ethambutol hydrochloride tablets, for which the WHO had supplied a number of different brands of products. The aims were to compare the dissolution profiles being generated during this study with those presented in the relevant WHO draft guideline (Chapter 4), and to establish whether the recommended dissolution conditions and specifications were appropriate for control of these FDC products. General requirements set for HPLC assay methods were: one method for more than one API, easily available columns, the use of an isocratic profile, stability-indicating methods, and the possibility of determining related substances using the same assay method(s). HPLC methods from available literature were identified, screened and the best alternatives selected for further development. Method development and validation were initially performed on the 4 FDC tablets, then adjusted for lower API combinations and eventually for Rifampicin tablets and capsules. The assay method for determining rifampicin was also used for testing rifampicin degradation products. An infrared spectroscopic method was developed as identity test for Rifampicin tablets and capsules. As an alternative for identifying rifampicin in Rifampicin tablets and capsules a colour -, a TLC - and an HPLC test (based on correlating retention times of Rifampicin in the sample and standard solutions from the assay test results) were developed. For the FDC products, two identity tests (HPLC and TLC) were developed. Results and discussion: 4 FDC products were successfully analysed by employing two methods, i. e. one for analysing ethambutol hydrochloride, isoniazid and pyrazinamide, and a second for analysing rifampicin and its related substances. Ethambutol hydrochloride does not absorb UV light; however, it forms a complex with cupric ions, with maximum absorption at 270 nm. By including Cu(II) acetate in the mobile phase, ethambutol hydrochloride was successfully quantified by UV detection. For the assay of FDC products not containing ethambutol hydrochloride, Cu(II) acetate was omitted from the mobile phase. The validation outcomes confirmed the suitability of these methods. The mobile phase of the TLC test for the identification of APIs in FDC products, consisted of methano 1 :strong ammonia solution (100 : 1. 5). The TLC plate could be inspected under W light (254 nm) after exposing it to iodine vapours. In the absence of W light (254 nm), the pyrazinamide spot was only vaguely visible when inspected in <b>daylight</b> after iodine <b>exposure.</b> The spot-intensity of isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol hydrochloride is concentration dependent and can be used for semi-quantitative determination of these APIs in anti-tuberculosis FDCs. The dissolution study was conducted according to the conditions as set out in a draft WHO guideline for products containing BCS (Biopharmaceutics Classification System) defined, highly soluble APIs. The study and acceptance criterion were accepted by the WHO and included in the monograph for isoniazid and ethambutol hydrochloride tablets. Disintegration has been included as an alternative to dissolution, with the acceptance criterion based on a correlation between the dissolution profiles and disintegration times, as had been determined for products being supplied by the WHO. Conclusion: The monographs were compiled according to the format, as required by the WHO, and submitted to the WHO. The monographs were distributed for review within the WHO advisory channels and discussed at WHO consultation and expert committee meetings. Feed-back was considered and the monographs updated accordingly. The monographs were approved for The International Pharmacopoeia during a meeting of the 4 oth WHO Expert Committee on Specifications for Pharmaceutical Preparations. The monographs have been posted on the WHO website and are to be included in the fourth edition of The International Pharmacopoeia. Doctora...|$|R
