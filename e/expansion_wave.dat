40|$|AbstractThe {{supersonic}} isentropic inlet {{is a type}} of inlet that is easy to {{be adopted}} to hypersonic and supersonic flying vehicle configuration and suitable to work over a large range of flying states. The inlet has a sound performance in terms of total pressure recovery and flow coefficient owing to its compact design to decrease the negative influences of shock waves. However, it still remains a tough task to design the inlet for the time being. It is here introduced in the paper the concept of <b>expansion</b> <b>waves</b> to simplify the design process of isentropic inlet. It is known to all that the air captured by the inlet will gradually decrease its speed due to influence of the countless numbers of compression waves. However, as we observe in the opposite direction, the air will accelerate its speed gradually in <b>expansion</b> <b>waves</b> flow field. One thing will remain the same in the preceding two flow situations, namely, streamline. Based on the idea, the profile traced in <b>expansion</b> <b>waves</b> flow field can yield the compression surface of isentropic inlet. <b>Expansion</b> <b>waves</b> are phenomena that are very common in supersonic flows. Certain types of <b>expansion</b> <b>waves</b> in a steady uniform parallel two-dimensional flow, which are called Prandtl-Meyer waves, can be analyzed by simple equations. With the joint solution of the MOC equations and Prandtl-Meyer equations, the supersonic <b>expansion</b> <b>waves</b> flow field, serving as the base flow field of designed inlet, can be obtained precisely. Next, the introduction of bilinear interpolation method allows the calculation of each point on a streamline starting from a given initial point. Finally, a streamline-traced sketch, derived from the above base flow field, will be the desired inlet forebody. The following two-dimensional numerical simulation conducted accordingly indicates the actual performance well satisfy the designed state. The fact that the designed inlet has a good performance in terms of total pressure recovery means that the design method is practical and feasible, and broadens applications of design method of such inlets...|$|R

50|$|A Ludwieg tube is a {{wind tunnel}} that {{produces}} supersonic flow {{for short periods}} of time. A large evacuated dump tank is separated from the downstream end of a convergent-divergent nozzle by a diaphragm or fast acting valve. The upstream end of the nozzle connects to a long cylindrical tube, whose cross-sectional area is significantly larger than the throat area of the nozzle. Initially, the pressure in the nozzle and tube is high. To start the tunnel, the diaphragm is ruptured, e.g., by piercing it with a suitable cutting device, or opening the valve respectively. As always when a diaphragm ruptures, a shock wave propagates into the low-pressure region (here the dump tank) and an <b>expansion</b> <b>wave</b> propagates into the high-pressure region (here the nozzle and the long tube). As this unsteady expansion propagates through the long tube, it sets up a steady subsonic flow toward the nozzle, which is accelerated by the convergent-divergent nozzle to a supersonic condition. The flow is steady until the expansion, having been reflected from {{the far end of}} the tube, arrives at the nozzle again. For practical reasons, flow times are about 100 milliseconds for most Ludwieg tubes. For many purposes, this flow duration is sufficient. However, by taking advantage of multiple quasi-static flows between <b>expansion</b> <b>wave</b> reflections, experimentation times of up to 6 seconds can be achieved.|$|E

5000|$|By {{combining}} SPM and vibrational spectroscopy, AFM/IR-NSOM and AFM-IR {{have emerged}} as useful characterization tools that integrate the high spatial resolution abilities of AFM with IR spectroscopy. This new technique {{can be referred to}} as AFM/FTIR and NSOM/FTIR. AFM and NSOM can be used to detect the response when a modulated infrared radiation generated by an FTIR spectrometer is absorbed by a material. In the AFM-IR technique the absorption of the radiation by sample will cause a rapid thermal <b>expansion</b> <b>wave</b> which will be transferred to the vibrational modes of the AFM cantilever. Specifically, thermal <b>expansion</b> <b>wave</b> induces a vertical displacement of the ATM tip (Figure 6). A local IR absorption spectrum then can be obtained through the measurement of the amplitude of the cantilever, which {{is a function of the}} IR source wavelength. For example, when the radiation laser wavelength is tuned at the resonance frequency with the vibrational absorption frequency of the sample, the displacement intensity of the cantilever will increase until the laser wavelength reaches the maximum of sample absorption. The displacement of the cantilever will then be reduced as the laser wavelength is tuned past the absorption maximum. This approach can map chemical composition beyond the diffraction-limit resolution and can also provide three-dimensional topographic, thermal and mechanical information at the nanoscale. Overall, it overcomes the resolution limit of traditional IR spectroscopy and adds chemical and mechanical mapping to the AFM and NSOM.|$|E
