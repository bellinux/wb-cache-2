5|$|Despite {{the knee}} injury, Croyle {{received}} interest from members the Southeastern Conference and the Atlantic Coast Conference, including Louisiana State and Florida State. Croyle showed interest in playing for Florida State {{due in part}} because of the team's offensive coordinator, Mark Richt. Croyle initially showed little interest in playing for Alabama after their head coach, Mike DuBose had recently been fired, but once Richt took the head coaching job with the Georgia Bulldogs, Croyle followed in his father's <b>footsteps.</b> <b>On</b> the night before he was to announce his college decision to play for Florida State, Croyle announced that he would instead play for the Alabama Crimson Tide. Interestingly enough, the Crimson Tide were not fazed by Croyle’s rather serious ligament tear, for they felt he would heal well enough that his talent still warranted a spot on the roster. Croyle graduated early from high school and enrolled at the University of Alabama in January 2001. After red-shirting his freshman year at Alabama, Croyle earned a spot as the top backup in his second season behind senior starter Tyler Watts. Croyle's coaches voted for him as the Ozzie Newsome Most Improved Freshman after starting two games in 2002. After the 2002 season, Alabama head coach Dennis Franchione resigned to take the same position at Texas A. Washington State head coach Mike Price was hired to replace Franchione in January 2003.|$|E
25|$|Broadcast 23 December 1993, {{the final}} {{instalment}} discusses human exploration of Antarctica, {{in particular the}} mission led by Captain Robert Falcon Scott, whose team died {{on the way back}} from the South Pole. Attenborough visits the hut at Cape Evans where Scott and his team spent the winter of 1911. It shows their well-equipped laboratory and the darkroom where the group's photographer, Herbert Ponting, developed his films. Attenborough contrasts the transportation used by Scott (initially motor sledge, ponies and dogs before ending up on foot) with today's helicopters. The episode also details the scientific work in the modern human bases in Antarctica, especially Mawson Base and its observation of Adelie penguins (partially through tracking devices). The film concludes that although working in Antarctica is now much easier than during the early days of exploration, human <b>footsteps</b> <b>on</b> the continent are still exceedingly rare — in part because of international treaties prohibiting industrial exploitation.|$|E
500|$|Akira Yamaoka {{composed}} {{the music for}} Silent Hill 2. At his home, Yamaoka took three days to write the music for [...] "Theme of Laura", Silent Hill 2s main theme, by combining [...] "a sad melody" [...] and [...] "a strong beat", although he does not consider the melody to be the [...] "most important" [...] element of a musical piece. He wanted the music to evoke emotions in the player. Silent Hill 2 makes extensive use of sound effects ranging from screams to <b>footsteps</b> <b>on</b> broken glass. In charge of the game's fifty sound effects, Yamaoka wanted to surprise the player with different sounds and create an unsettling environment. He also incorporated occasional silence, commenting that [...] "selecting moments of silence {{is another way of}} producing sound".|$|E

500|$|Presenting {{the episode}} without music was Whedon's way of denying the {{audience}} any comfort, {{forcing them to}} discern their own meanings from the characters' actions and words. As two musicologists write about this absence, [...] "Without music's acoustic balm, all our empathetic attention is on the characters and their state of bewilderment ... Music would provide a conceptualization and a catharsis ... but a catharsis at this point would in some measure trivialize the loss." [...] Television critic Gareth McLean writes that this decision is [...] "a move that makes it more courageous than, for instance, ER. There were no soaring strings or plaintive piano to trigger an emotional response. Instead the soundtrack took in the ambient noises of wind chimes, doors squeaking, <b>footsteps</b> <b>on</b> carpets. Conversations were stilted and awkward, but the spaces in between always mattered." ...|$|E
500|$|John FitzAlan {{the father}} had been a {{prominent}} soldier in the Hundred Years' War under King Henry V, and the son followed in his father's <b>footsteps.</b> <b>On</b> 23 April 1430, the younger FitzAlan departed for France in the company of the Earl of Huntingdon. [...] There he soon {{made a name for himself}} as a soldier, under the command of the king's uncle, John, Duke of Bedford. In June he took part in the Siege of Compiègne, where Joan of Arc had recently been captured. Later, he raised the siege of Anglure with the help of the Burgundians. On 17 December 1431, he was present when Henry VI was crowned King of France in Paris, where he distinguished himself at the accompanying tournament. FitzAlan's military success led to several important appointments of command; in November 1431, he was made lieutenant of the Rouen garrison, and shortly after also captain of Vernon. [...] In January 1432 he was appointed captain of Verneuil. [...] On the night of 3 February he was taken by surprise while in bed at the Great Tower of Rouen Castle, when a band of French soldiers from nearby Ricarville managed to take the castle. [...] Arundel was hoisted down the walls in a basket; and made his escape. [...] The assailants could not hold the castle, because Marshall Boussac refused to garrison the town; Guillaume de Ricarville was forced to surrender twelve days later. In April 1432, FitzAlan was rewarded for his actions so far by initiation into the Order of the Garter.|$|E

2500|$|Jeffrey Overstreet {{adds that}} [...] "the scenes in which Chigurh stalks Moss are as suspenseful as {{anything}} the Coens have ever staged. And that {{has as much}} to do with what we hear as what we see. No Country for Old Men lacks a traditional soundtrack, but don't say it doesn't have music. The blip-blip-blip of a transponder becomes as frightening as the famous theme from Jaws. The sound of <b>footsteps</b> <b>on</b> the hardwood floors of a hotel hallway are as ominous as the drums of war. When the leather of a briefcase squeaks against the metal of a ventilation shaft, you'll cringe, and the distant echo of a telephone ringing in a hotel lobby will jangle your nerves." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} morning hours of July 12, 1898 Garrett and his posse confronted Oliver M. Lee and James Gililland at a spot called [...] "Wildy Well" [...] near Orogrande, Texas. Garrett had hoped to capture the fugitives while they were sleeping, but Lee and Gililland {{expected}} trouble and took their bedrolls up to the roof of the bunkhouse to avoid being taken by surprise. One of Garrett's deputies named Kearney heard <b>footsteps</b> <b>on</b> the roof, scaled a ladder, and was mortally wounded by the fugitives. A stray shot nicked Garrett. Because of his concern for his dying deputy, Garrett arranged a truce with the fugitives and withdrew while Kearney was lifted into a wagon. Kearney, however, died on the road to Las Cruces, and Lee and Gililland remained at large for another eight months, before they finally surrendered to Sheriff George Curry. They were found not guilty in the Fountain killings, and the indictments for killing the deputy were also dismissed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{landscape}} {{has been}} described as [...] "Kahn's most elegant built example of landscape planning" [...] by Philadelphia landscape architect George Patton. Approaching the main entrance past a lawn edged by pools with running water, the visitor enters a courtyard through a grove of Yaupon Holly trees. The sound of <b>footsteps</b> <b>on</b> the gravel walkway echoes from the walls {{on either side of the}} courtyard and is magnified under the curved ceiling of the entry porch. [...] After that subtle preparation, the visitor enters the hushed museum with silvery light spread across its ceiling. Harriet Pattison played the lead role in the landscape design and is also the person who suggested that open porches flanking the entrance would create a good transition from the lawn and courtyard to the galleries inside. [...] Pattison, who had also worked with Kahn on other projects, was an employee of Patton. She is the mother of film director Nathaniel Kahn, Louis Kahn's son who made the film [...] "My Architect" [...] about his father.|$|E

60|$|Then {{was heard}} a subdued <b>footstep</b> <b>on</b> the stairs; and Ralph Nickleby, hat in hand, crept softly into the room, {{with his body}} bent forward as if in {{profound}} respect, and his eyes fixed upon {{the face of his}} worthy client.|$|R
60|$|He had. A {{moment later}} it was only too evident that this was {{precisely}} what Mr. Plummer had done. There was a <b>footstep</b> <b>on</b> the stairs, a heavy footstep this time, and from outside {{the voice of the}} pursuer made itself heard.|$|R

6000|$|Just {{here there}} was an eager <b>footstep</b> <b>on</b> the stair; I opened the door, and my aunt Mary burst into the room. It was a joyful meeting and a cheery {{bombardment}} of questions and answers concerning family matters ensued. By and by my aunt said: ...|$|R

60|$|Then in {{the midst}} of the awesome silence that {{followed}} on that loudly spoken curse, there was the sound of a firm <b>footstep</b> <b>on</b> the rough deal floor, and the next moment Michael Richard de Chavasse was kneeling beside his mother, and covering her icy cold hand with kisses.|$|R
60|$|The golden line {{vanished}} in parts like the phosphorescent streak {{caused by the}} striking of a match; there was the fall of a light <b>footstep</b> <b>on</b> the floor just behind it: then a pause.
