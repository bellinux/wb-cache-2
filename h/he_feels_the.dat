5|$|Eddie {{takes on}} the {{appearance}} of Mulder and visits Nelligan, showing her a photo of Eddie. Nelligan tells him that she went out with him in high school, but views him as rather a loser lacking in any drive or ambition. The disappointed Eddie leaves, just as the real Mulder shows up. Realizing that Eddie just visited Nelligan in his guise, Mulder searches for him down the hospital corridors. He finds the fertility doctor and a security guard nearby and handcuffs them to each other, believing {{one of them to}} be Eddie. The real Eddie, however, is hiding in a vent above. He gets the jump on Mulder and locks him up in the hospital basement. Eddie takes Mulder's form and tells Scully that <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>the</b> case {{is a waste of time}} and they should return to Washington.|$|E
5|$|Parsifal {{wonders if}} the Garden is a dream and asks {{how it is that}} Kundry knows his name. Kundry tells him she learned it from his mother (""), who had loved him and tried to shield him from his father's fate, the mother he had {{abandoned}} and who had finally died of grief. She reveals many parts of Parsifal's history to him and he is stricken with remorse, blaming himself for his mother's death. He thinks himself very stupid to have forgotten her. Kundry says this realization is a first sign of understanding and that, with a kiss, she can help him understand his mother's love. As they kiss Parsifal suddenly recoils in pain and cries out Amfortas' name: <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>the</b> wounded king's pain burning in his own side and now understands Amfortas' passion during the Grail Ceremony (""). Filled with this compassion, Parsifal rejects Kundry's advances.|$|E

25|$|Freddy is a dream-demon who attacks {{his victims}} from within their dreams. He is {{commonly}} identified by his burned, disfigured face, red-and-green striped sweater, brown fedora, and trademark metal-clawed brown leather glove only {{on his right}} hand. This glove {{was the product of}} Krueger's own imagination, the blade having been welded by himself. Robert Englund has said many times that <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>the</b> character represents neglect, particularly that suffered by children. The character also more broadly represents subconscious fears.|$|E

500|$|Steven Williams {{has noted}} that <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>the</b> episodes [...] "Nisei" [...] and [...] "731" [...] were chiefly {{responsible}} for the character's popularity with fans.

500|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the soundtrack was the choice of songs; Tarantino has said that <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>the</b> music to be a {{counterpoint}} to the on-screen violence and action.

500|$|Following {{its home}} video release, [...] "D'oh-in' in the Wind" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Giving the episode a positive review, Aaron Roxby of Collider wrote that, {{even though he}} felt that the jokes about hippies were [...] "a bit overplayed", he still considered it {{to be one of the}} best episodes of the season. James Plath of DVD Town thought fondly of the episode as well, calling it [...] "funny". Writing for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson stated that, even though <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>the</b> sixties have been lampooned [...] "many, many times over the years", he considered [...] "D'oh-in' in the Wind" [...] to be a successful spoof of the era. He enjoyed the way the episode portrayed and mocked the ways aging hippies [...] "didn't live up to their youthful ideas". He concluded his review by writing that [...] "D'oh-in' in the Wind" [...] is one of the first great episodes of the season.|$|E
500|$|Upon Blaine's first appearance, Criss {{described}} his character {{as being a}} [...] "very charismatic, put-together, composed guy." [...] He stated that although Blaine is gay, he is not [...] "overly queeny, and not too butch either," [...] and that while his sexuality is a [...] "huge part of who he is", {{it is not a}} major facet of how he wishes to be perceived. Due to similarities which stem from their shared sexuality, Blaine [...] "sees a lot of himself in Kurt, in terms of experiences and the way they feel about the world around them. <b>He</b> <b>feels</b> <b>the</b> need to impart his knowledge, be a source of strength for him, and really help him through what he's going through." [...] Initially, Criss felt that the most important element of his character was to give Kurt [...] "someone he can relate to", and demonstrate that Kurt could have [...] "a young out male friend, a support system".|$|E
500|$|Throughout the novel, Little Bee {{considers}} how {{she would}} explain England to [...] "the girls back home" [...] in Nigeria. Cleave uses the girls as a Greek chorus, providing a foil to allow the cultural dissonance experienced by Little Bee to be made explicit. <b>He</b> <b>feels</b> <b>the</b> device is more natural than having Little Bee narrate her alarm first hand, allowing the reader to appreciate the cultural gulf, and Little Bee to seem knowing as opposed to tragic. Through Little Bee's narration, Cleave examines human culture from the opposite perspective as science fiction does, having an extraordinary protagonist explore an ordinary world. This contemporary realism gives a significance to mundane events experienced by Little Bee, while bringing into focus [...] "sad and ignoble" [...] aspects of English culture such as the detention system. Cleave commented: [...] "We have become accustomed to viewing our own actions in soft focus, but the alien narrator has not yet acquired this cultural immunity. She sees us as {{we can no longer}} see ourselves." ...|$|E

500|$|Lois mocking [...] (or, as it {{is called}} in the scene, Stymie Gruffin: The Untold Story), citing the movie as a middle finger to the {{audience}} by being three episodes slapped together under the guise of a movie (followed by Brian calling in two bodyguards in suits to take Lois away) was edited on TV for time reasons. A deleted scene showed one of Peter's crimes being a hate crime, where during his stunt he hit a car with a Jewish driver. The televised scene changed the Jewish driver to a female virgin driver and the crime being a rape (her airbag having busted her hymen when it deployed) and not a hate crime. The scene of Stewie getting high on NyQuil to cope with losing Rupert and mistaking a throw pillow for a cat was cut from TV airings for time reasons. David Goodman noted that <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>the</b> production crew may not have succeeded on this episode as everything falls into place easily, such as the box falling out of the moving truck. Every frame when Stewie is dancing in a montage of Anchors Aweigh took a large amount of work to produce.|$|E
500|$|According to Gruff Rhys [...] "Do or Die" [...] has a [...] "ridiculously {{positive}} outlook" [...] and {{was written}} {{in an attempt to}} [...] "kickstart [...] back into gear" [...] after a bad period in the singer's life. The track is a [...] "driving song" [...] and features sampled car noises so that [...] "even if you're not in a car it feels like you are". Although Rhys has called the track a [...] "dumb pop song" [...] with [...] "really daft" [...] lyrics, he has also claimed that the title was inspired by the Quit India speech made by Mahatma Gandhi on 8 August 1942 at the Gowalia Tank in Bombay in which Gandhi called for his countrymen to [...] "Do or Die" [...] and use non-violent resistance to end British Imperial rule in India. Rhys has stated that <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>the</b> fact that [...] "five-year-olds" [...] can jump up and down to the song, singing [...] "Gandhi lyrics", is important, as it contrasts with the [...] "self-important ... pompous" [...] lyrics of singers such as Jim Morrison and Robert Plant. The track was recorded in the middle of 1998 at Real World Studios, Box, Wiltshire, {{along with the rest of}} Guerrilla, and was produced by Super Furry Animals.|$|E

Mulder consults an expert in the occult, who notes that, in order to commit hexes, the man must draw energy from a charm and place blood, hair and a picture of the victim inside a [...] "poppet" [...] in order to follow through with the hexes. Meanwhile, Mrs. Wieder is burned to death during an MRI, and the [...] "hoodoo man" [...] is found taking her doll out of a microwave.

Mulder assumes the man is her father and that <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>the</b> doctor stole his family away from him.
