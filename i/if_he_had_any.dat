5|$|MGySgt Guadalupe Denogean is an {{immigrant}} from Mexico {{who has served}} in the Marine Corps for 25 years. Denogean was wounded in combat in Basra, Iraq. During {{the time that he}} received treatment for his wounds, he was asked <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> requests. His answer was that he had two: First, he wanted a promotion for the corporal who helped rescue him, and second he wanted to be an American citizen.|$|E
5|$|By the 1030s Malcolm's sons, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>any,</b> were dead. The only {{evidence}} that {{he did have a}} son or sons is in Rodulfus Glaber's chronicle where Cnut is said to have stood as godfather to a son of Malcolm. His grandson Thorfinn would have been unlikely to be accepted as king by the Scots, and he chose the sons of his other daughter, Bethóc, who was married to Crínán, lay abbot of Dunkeld, and perhaps Mormaer of Atholl. It may be no more than coincidence, but in 1027 the Irish annals had reported the burning of Dunkeld, although no mention is made of the circumstances. Malcolm's chosen heir, and the first tánaise ríg certainly known in Scotland, was Duncan.|$|E

5|$|Juventus {{have played}} {{in black and white}} striped shirts, with white shorts, {{sometimes}} black shorts since 1903. Originally, they played in pink shirts with a black tie. The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in 1903 the club sought to replace them. Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that would better withstand the elements. He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts to Turin. Juventus have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful.|$|E

The air tasking order (ATO) {{that was supposed to}} list all scheduled coalition aircraft missions for that day and which the two pilots reviewed before takeoff, mentioned that U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters would be operating in the TAOR that day but did not list takeoff times, routes, or flight durations for them.

5|$|Does it {{surprise}} {{you that a}} busy man found time to finish so many volumes, many of which deal with such minute details?... He used to begin to study at night on the Festival of Vulcan, not for luck but from his love of study, long before dawn; in winter he would commence at the seventh hour... He could sleep at call, and it would come upon him and leave {{him in the middle}} of his work. Before daybreak he would go to Vespasian– for he too was a night-worker– and then set about his official duties. On his return home he would again give to study any time that he had free. Often in summer after taking a meal, which with him, as in the old days, was always a simple and light one, he would lie in the sun <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> time to spare, and a book would be read aloud, from which he would take notes and extracts.|$|E

5|$|When {{recording}} was completed, Gridneff asked Boucher <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> {{ideas for}} a further season of Star Cops. Boucher felt that were the series to continue {{he would like to}} extend the setting further out into the Solar System, visiting the Mars colonies and the Big Ring space colonies under construction. He intended to achieve this either by transferring one of the existing regular characters to the Mars colony or by introducing a new regular who would be based there. The second season was never developed beyond these few basic notions as it was clear to Boucher from an early stage that there was little prospect of the series being renewed. Following Star Cops, Boucher went on to work as script editor on the long-running ITV police drama The Bill before returning to freelance writing while Gridneff moved on to work on the BBC drama series The House of Eliott.|$|E
5|$|Darius {{was the son}} of Hystaspes and the {{grandson}} of Arsames. Both men belonged to the Achaemenid tribe and were still alive when Darius ascended the throne. Darius justifies his ascension to the throne with his lineage. He claimed he could trace his ancestors back to Achaemenes, even though he was only distantly related. With this in mind, Darius married Atossa, daughter of Cyrus, with whom he had four sons: Xerxes, Achaemenes, Masistes and Hystaspes. He also married Artystone, another daughter of Cyrus, with whom he had two sons, Arsames and Gobryas. Darius married Parmys, the daughter of Bardiya, with whom he had a son, Ariomardus. Furthermore, Darius married Phratagune, with whom he had two sons, Abrokomas and Hyperantes. He also married another woman of the nobility, Phaidyme, the daughter of Otanes. It is unknown <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> children with her. Before these royal marriages, Darius had married an unknown daughter of his good friend and lance carrier Gobryas from an early marriage, with whom he had three sons, Artobazanes, Ariabignes and Arsamenes. Any daughters he had with her are not known. Although Artobazanes was Darius's first-born, Xerxes became heir and the next king through the influence of Atossa; she had great authority in the kingdom as Darius loved her the most of all his wives.|$|E

While Davidson is primarily known as a scriptwriter, it is not known <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> contribution toward the writing of the sketches, as he is only credited as a performer. In total, Davidson is credited as appearing in eight episodes of the show, which is more than any other male actor who was not a Python.

25|$|The Italian {{football}} club Juventus F.C. derived its famous black-and-white striped kits from Notts County.

25|$|Austen {{began writing}} the novel after staying at Goodnestone Park in Kent {{with her brother}} Edward and his wife in 1796. It was {{originally}} titled First Impressions, and was written between October 1796 and August 1797. On 1 November 1797 Austen's father {{sent a letter to}} London bookseller Thomas Cadell to ask <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> interest in seeing the manuscript, but the offer was declined by return post. The militia were mobilised after the French declaration of war on Britain in February 1793, and there was initially a lack of barracks for all the militia regiments, requiring the militia to set up huge camps in the countryside, which the novel refers to several times. The Brighton camp for which the militia regiment leaves for in May after spending the winter in Meryton was opened in August 1793, and the barracks for all the regiments of the militia were completed by 1796, placing the events of the novel between 1793 and 1795.|$|E
25|$|While on {{a hunting}} trip in 1989 at Taylor Ranch in Colorado, Parker met Oklahoma City {{businessman}} Robert A. Funk. After Funk discovered that Parker was a wildlife artist, he asked Parker <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> examples {{of his work}} to show him. It just so happened that the artist had an elk bust sculpture called Perfection in his truck and, after showing it to Funk, a sale was consummated on the spot for the sculpture. Parker would meet Funk again at the C. M. Russell Art Show in 1999 and some years later he suggested to Funk that he could design a sculpture of a Clydesdale horse to be given as an award to exemplary employees of Funk's Express Employment Professionals company in Oklahoma City. A deal was struck between the two that resulted in Parker casting a now sold out 50-piece edition called Express Ranch Clydesdale. Over time, Funk has added several more Parker sculptures to his collection, including a monumental bronze elk sculpture for the entrance to his New Mexico ranch.|$|E

25|$|Each rote {{in the new}} {{allotment}} {{system had}} the responsibility to recruit a soldier for the army, provide his croft with a patch of land, a cow, a few chickens and few pigs or sheep so he could support a family, pay him his salary, and supply him with necessities such as hay and seed. The rote also had to provide the soldier with the uniform. The croft and land, located on {{the land of the}} rote, only belonged to the soldier {{as long as he was}} fit for service. If he died or had to retire, the croft would have to be returned to the rote, even if it made his family homeless; the rote in turn had to find a new recruit. It sometimes happened that a widow of a dead soldier married the rote's new recruit, as the rote was regarded as responsible to take care also of the remaining family of its fallen serviceman. The soldier lived at his croft for large parts of his life, mostly working at the farms that supported his household, and went away to a few training camps a year, honing his tactics and skills with his regiment. When at war, the soldier could be away for years at a time, leaving all of the chores to his wife and children, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>any.</b> Otherwise, the rote farmers would take over the work themselves.|$|E
