40|$|The {{truck and}} busses rear axle {{production}} process characteristics does not remove all impurities in {{parts per million}} (PPM) of metallic and non metallic materials, than as necessary a premature oil change knower “first replacement oil”. This kind of service occurs at five thousand kilometers in average to assure the internal components life (<b>gear</b> <b>assy,</b> retainers and bearings). Evaluating the material properties and rear axle functionalities characteristics were defined to fixing some magnets inside the rear axle housing separated according to minimum distance specification each other. The main idea is attract the metallic particles in oil at rear axle to the magnets (ferromagnetic properties) and also non metallic particles by mechanical friction created by oil movement around <b>gear</b> <b>assy.</b> Considering the impurities volume found out at samples universe at durability tests done are in PPM, the magnets dimension were defined to all rear axle life prediction. Oil samples were evaluated during durability test according to truck and busses maker, rear axle supplier and oil laboratory specialist definition. Up to now, the results show the materials reduction at suspension particles at oil and physica...|$|E
