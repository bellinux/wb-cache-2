40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} several designing {{procedures for}} chain sampling inspection plan (ChSP- 1) for given values of AQL and LQL and with associated requirements {{with respect to}} the risks. Though, these procedures differ methodologically in arriving at solutions, their common primary aim refers to minimise the actual risks. This study reveals that too many procedures yield too many rather different solutions, thus confusing the user in choosing a plan. In this paper a procedure is developed to compare the seven different procedures in order to show the ambiguity of the procedures and their results. Moreover, some fundamental considerations concerning product control and process control lead to the conclusion that acceptance sampling and in particular chain sampling which was introduced more than 50 years ago might be out-of-time and should be replaced by <b>efficient</b> <b>process</b> <b>control</b> using the possibilities of modern IT technologies. ...|$|E

In order to enable continuous process monitoring and <b>efficient</b> <b>process</b> <b>control</b> in such cases, soft sensors are usually used to estimate these difficult-to-measure process variables.

The first {{is to reduce the}} cost of treatment. The second is a response to new legislation aimed at reducing the carryover of toxic materials to receiving waters. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to focus on the pivotal role of bacterial respiration in the aerobic treatment process. The importance of respiration in this context is that it is quickly and easily measurable. Using new technologically advanced respirometers it is possible to use respiration measurements for modelling the treatment process, for management of toxicity, and for measuring short term BOD, nitrification capacity, readily degradable BOD treatment capacity, and aeration requirements.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a tube hydroforming process is largely {{dependent on the}} process control parameters (i. e. the internal pressure and the axial feeding) since they determine the occurrence of forming limits such as wrinkling and bursting. Therefore, these parameters should be carefully selected.

This method avoids the onset of wrinkling and bursting via dedicated stability criteria. The wrinkling criterion uses an energy-based indicator inspired on the plastic bifurcation theory. For necking, followed by bursting, a criterion based on the forming limit curve is employed. Applying these two criteria, the process parameters are adjusted during the simulation via a fuzzy knowledge based controller (FKBC).

40|$|Females of some {{bird species}} {{have a high}} degree of control over the sex ratio of their {{offspring}} at laying. Although several mechanisms have been put forward to explain how females might control the sex of their eggs, virtually nothing is known. As females are the heterogametic sex in birds, adjustment of the clutch sex ratio could arise either by pre- or post-ovulation control mechanisms. The Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis) exhibits extreme adaptive egg sex ratio bias. Typically, warblers produce only single-egg clutches, but by translocating pairs to vacant habitat of very high quality, most females were induced to produce two-egg clutches. Overall, females skewed clutch sex ratios strongly towards daughters (86. 6 %). This bias was evident in the first egg, but critically, also in the second eggs laid a day apart, even when all absent, unhatched, or unsexed second eggs were assumed to be male. Although a bias in the first egg may arise through either pre- or post-ovulation mechanisms, the skew observed in second eggs could only arise through pre-ovulation control. Post-ovulation adjustment may also contribute to skewed hatchling sex ratios, but as sex-biased release of gametes {{is likely to be a}} more <b>efficient</b> <b>process</b> of <b>control,</b> pre-ovulation mechanisms may be the sole means of adjustment in this species.

The high nonlinearity inherent in the dynamics of these reactors requires an <b>efficient</b> <b>process</b> <b>control</b> algorithm to handle the variation of operational process parameters {{and the effect of}} process disturbances efficiently. In this work, a multi-model adaptive control strategy is considered for achieving the goal mentioned above.

By {{monitoring}} {{the size of}} the board cut in a sawmill, performance of the production system can be controlled. Feedback from the quality control system is used to evaluate the status of the production system and also used for preventive maintenance of the system. The software technique developed in this thesis involves three parts: image acquisition and analysis, quality control analysis, and power consumption analysis. An image of the boards is acquired, and board edges are identified and analyzed to compute the board widths. The effects of defects present on the board surface on the computation of board width are studied. The effect of camera distance {{from the surface of the}} object is also analyzed. Computed widths were compared with values measured with a caliper. The quality control program reads the computed board widths and then checks the measurements against control limits. The program also computes board averages and standard deviations and checks the averages against control limits. Between board deviations within cants and between saw pockets are also computed.

40|$|Abstract The thesis clearly {{demonstrates}} that photon migration measurements allow characterization of {{pulp and paper}} properties, especially the fines and filler content of pulp, and the basis weight, thickness and porosity of paper. Pulp and paper are materials with a worldwide significance. Their properties strongly depend on the manufacturing process used. For <b>efficient</b> <b>process</b> <b>control,</b> the employed monitoring and measuring has to be fast. Therefore it is worthwhile to try to develop new approaches and techniques for such measurements. Recent advancements in optics offer new possibilities for such development. If two samples have different optical properties their photon migration distributions are different. The measurement of a photon migration distribution allows some features between two optically slightly dissimilar samples to be distinguished. Some simple measurements, which only yielded the photons' average time of flight, were made with an oscilloscope and a time-of-flight lidar. More precise measurements yielding photon pathway distribution or some selected characteristics like light pulse rise time, broadening, or fall time were measured with a streak camera. Two methods to assess photon path length distribution were introduced: particle determination with simulation, and streak camera with deconvolution. The basic properties for pulp are consistency and fines content and for paper the basic properties are thickness, basis weight and porosity. The influence on photon migration caused by changes in these basic properties was determined. As pulp and paper are rarely very basic, an additional property was demonstrated for both materials. For pulp it was the content of filler talc, and for paper it {{was the use of}} beaten pulp as a raw material. These additional properties were also distinguishable...|$|E

The harvester would operate on the site, {{and it would be}} comprised of a base machine, an accumulating felling head, and a compacting device. Separation of pulpwood and energy wood fractions would take place at a pulp mill. In this experiment, the trees were topped and the top sections were left at the site. The concept was evaluated from an ecological and eco-nomic point of view. Nutrient losses were significantly lower compared to whole-tree harvesting. The energy frac-tion increased by 150 % compared to the cut-to-length method, in which stem bark represents the energy frac-tion. In bundle transportation, the load-bearing capacity of standard trucks can be highly utilized. For short distance hauling by conventional forwarders, an expansion of the load space is required in order to improve the utilization of the load-bearing capacity. Due to insufficient compaction capability when deal-ing with large trees, the bundling concept seems to be more appealing in harvesting energy wood from dense stands characterized by small stem size. In energy wood procurement, the bundling concept has several indirect advantages compared to the conventional forest chip pro-duction. Standard vehicles, with minor modifications, can be used for transportation. Machines involved in the op-eration can work independently, increasing the reliability of the system.

As a result, {{a greater number of}} process variables need to be measured and new expensive process analyzers need to be installed to achieve <b>efficient</b> <b>process</b> <b>control.</b> This involves synergy between plant experts, system analysts and process operators. One of the common problems in industrial plants is the inability of the real time and continuous measurement of key process variables. Absence of key value measurement in a timely manner aggravates control, but {{it does not mean that}} it is always an impossible step. As an alternative, the use of soft sensors as a substitute for process analyzers and laboratory testing is suggested. With the soft sensors, the objective is to develop an inferential model to estimate infrequently measured variables and laboratory assays using the frequently measured variables. By development of soft sensors based on measurement of continuous variables (such as flow, temperature, pressure) it is possible to estimate the difficult- -to-measure variables as well as product quality and emissions usually carried by laboratory assays. Software sensors, as part of virtual instrumentation, are focused on assessing the system state variables and quality products by applying the model, thus replacing the physical measurement and laboratory analysis. Multiple linear/nonlinear regression methods and artificial intelligence methods (such as neural network, fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms) are usually applied in the design of soft sensor models for identification of nonlinear processes. Review of published research and industrial application in the field of soft sensors is given with the methods of soft sensor development and nonlinear dynamic model identification.

40|$|N,N. -Ethylenebisstearimide (EBS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonlyused {{lubricants}} in the powder metallurgy (PM) industry in the sintering process. During sintering, the lubricated powder compacts are heat-treated to temperatures in excess of 1, 200 °C thus fusing adjacent particles and yielding a part with improved mechanical strength. Delubrication commonly is achieved in the first zone of a sintering furnace by heating the part to temperatures in the 500 - 600 °C temperature range at a fixed rate and under controlled atmospheric conditions; this strategy minimizes defects, carbon contamination, and compact deformation. The de-lubricated part then enters the second zone (commonly in the 1200 - 1300 °C temperature range) for sintering. The third zone cools the sintered part at a desired rate to obtain the requisite micro-structural properties. Controlled delubrication is imperative towards achieving high quality parts for the following reasons: the elevated thermal gradient at the transition between the first and second zones can cause parts to expand rapidly and develop microscopic fissures (. blistering.); improper gas flows and belt speeds can lead to carbon deposition on the part and at the grain boundaries (sooting); delubrication products deposit throughout the furnace, even in the coolers, which are far removed from the preheating chamber, leading to significant maintenance costs; pollutants emitted in the exhaust stream of furnaces operating inefficiently are increasingly of environmental concern. In practice, lubricant removal is difficult to control, which often leads to reduced yields in PM manufacturing processes. Throughput is another important issue: process control ideally should lead to a delubrication cycle that yields defect-free parts in a minimum of furnace time, thereby increasing productivity and reducing the net energy consumption. <b>Efficient</b> <b>process</b> <b>control</b> requires rapid monitoring of suitable indicators, preferably gasphase products of delubrication. EBS thermolyzes relatively cleanly in a range of furnace atmospheres, but the mechanism governing the pyrolysis of EBS, compacted with iron powder, is not known and needs to be investigated to determine the parameters important for industrial control, as well as the optimal conditions of delubrication. In addition, a thorough understanding of the pre-sintering chemistry will enable the development of a process control sensor...|$|E

Razvoj naprednih senzora, koji se temelje na novim tehnologijama analitičke kemije i suvremenim elektroničkim napravama, važno je područje znanstvenog istraživanja, ali je cijena njihova razvoja vrlo visoka. Softverski senzori (virtual soft sensors, {{software}} sensors, soft analyzers) postaju važna alternativa skupim mjerenjima on-line u primjerima gdje se na temelju fundamentalnih i empirijskih modela može zaključivati o teško mjerljivim veličinama. Razvoj softverskih senzora danas postaje područje velikog interesa, pri čemu se na osnovi analitičkih i empirijskih modela mogu zaključivati i predviđati vrijednosti teško mjerljivih veličina stanja procesa, posebice kad se radi o složenim i nelinearnim procesima. Pri tome se znanja o procesu povezuju sa statističkim metodama za identificiranje i primjenjuju u svrhu optimiranja procesa. Mogućnosti primjene softverskih senzora posebno su široke u procesnoj industriji, ali i u drugim područjima, primjerice u biokemijskim istraživanjima. Budući da se softverski senzori realiziraju računalno, moguće je procjenjivati veličine unaprijed i na taj način optimirati djelovanje i vođenje procesa. Control {{systems and}} optimization procedures require regular and reliable measurements {{at the appropriate}} frequency. At the same time, legal regulations dictate strict product quality specifications and refinery emissions. As a result, {{a greater number of}} process variables need to be measured and new expensive process analyzers need to be installed to achieve <b>efficient</b> <b>process</b> <b>control.</b> This involves synergy between plant experts, system analysts and process operators. One of the common problems in industrial plants is the inability of the real time and continuous measurement of key process variables. Absence of key value measurement in a timely manner aggravates control, but {{it does not mean that}} it is always an impossible step. As an alternative, the use of soft sensors as a substitute for process analyzers and laboratory testing is suggested. With the soft sensors, the objective is to develop an inferential model to estimate infrequently measured variables and laboratory assays using the frequently measured variables. By development of soft sensors based on measurement of continuous variables (such as flow, temperature, pressure) it is possible to estimate the difficult-to-measure variables as well as product quality and emissions usually carried by laboratory assays. Software sensors, as part of virtual instrumentation, are focused on assessing the system state variables and quality products by applying the model, thus replacing the physical measurement and laboratory analysis. Multiple linear/nonlinear regression methods and artificial intelligence methods (such as neural network, fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms) are usually applied in the design of soft sensor models for identification of nonlinear processes. Review of published research and industrial application in the field of soft sensors is given with the methods of soft sensor development and nonlinear dynamic model identification. Based on soft sensors, it is possible to estimate product properties in a continuous manner as well as apply the methods of inferential control. By real plant application of the soft sensors, considerable savings could be expected, as well as compliance with strict legal regulations for product quality specifications and emissions...|$|E

During the study ABS and PVC samples were used inside which internal structure defects and defects of glue conjunction between components were modeled. During combining composite materials with the use of glue joints, {{there is a problem with}} homogenous distribution of the glue layer on the surface of an element, which results in the creation of defects in joint structure and the decline of active surface of adhesion forces on the combined materials. It is then necessary to control the quality of the conjunction between the glued surfaces. The use of non-contact diagnostic methods allows to analyze a larger surface which conditions in more <b>efficient</b> quality <b>control</b> <b>process.</b> In the study, external heat excitation was used - optical excitation with periodic variable signal (LockIn method) and unit step excitation (Pulse method).

40|$|Using event-related {{potentials}} (ERPs), {{we examined}} the relative contributions of familiarity and recollection to recognition memory for items and their study contexts in school-aged children and adults. Whereas adults were able to selectively accept target items and to reject familiar nontarget items in ail exclusion task, this discrimination was more difficult for children, as {{was evident in the}} high false alarm rates to nontargets even when item memory was controlled for. The analysis of the adults' ERPs revealed more flexible and task-appropriate retrieval mechanisms, as was evident in the correlates of familiarity, recollection, mid nontarget retrieval, as well as in postretrieval evaluation. In contrast, children's ERPs revealed a parietal old/new effect for targets taken as a putative correlate of recollection. These findings suggest that children rely predominantly oil recollection during recognition judgments, {{even in the absence of}} <b>efficient</b> memory <b>control</b> <b>processes.</b> The latter processes enable adults to monitor and verify the retrieved information and to control nontarget retrieval in the service of adequate source memory performance...|$|R
