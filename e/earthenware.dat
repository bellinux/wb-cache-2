5|$|The Sadamisaki Peninsula {{area has}} been {{inhabited}} {{since at least the}} Jōmon period (10,000–300 BC), as evidenced by the discovery of stone tools and <b>earthenware</b> pots in the Misaki and Kushi neighborhoods.|$|E
5|$|Blood lead {{concentrations}} in poisoning victims {{have ranged from}} 30->80µg/dL in children exposed to lead paint in older houses, 77–104µg/dL in persons working with pottery glazes, 90–137µg/dL in individuals consuming contaminated herbal medicines, 109–139µg/dL in indoor shooting range instructors and as high as 330µg/dL in those drinking fruit juices from glazed <b>earthenware</b> containers.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, metal {{movable type}} {{printing}} {{was developed in}} Ming Dynasty China (and earlier in Joseon Korea, by the mid 13th century), and was widely applied in China by at least the 16th century. In Jiangsu and Fujian, wealthy Ming era families sponsored the use of metal type printing (mostly using bronze). This included the printing works of Hua Sui (1439–1513), who pioneered the first Chinese bronze-type movable printing in the year 1490. In 1718, during the mid Qing Dynasty (1644–1912), the scholar of Tai'an known as Xu Zhiding developed movable type with enamelware instead of <b>earthenware.</b> There was also Zhai Jinsheng (b. 1784), a teacher of Jingxian, Anhui, who spent thirty years making a font of <b>earthenware</b> movable type, and by 1844 he had over 100,000 Chinese writing characters in five sizes.|$|E
5|$|The {{road through}} Gateshead Fell was turnpiked by the Durham to Tyne Bridge Road Act in 1747. Although it had brought some early {{settlers}} to the area, {{the development of}} industry allowed the formative settlement to grow. In 1740, John Warburton opened a pottery at Carr Hill which is credited with introducing white <b>earthenware</b> to Tyneside. Encouraged by Warburton's success, Paul Jackson established the Sheriff Hill Pottery in 1771 at {{the northern end of}} the turnpike road and by 1775 was advertising his <b>earthenware</b> in the Newcastle Journal. Jackson's pottery, which became a local centre of pottery production, attracted settlers to the area and became a source of pride to local residents.|$|E
5|$|Pottery {{and weaving}} {{are among the}} very first art forms {{showcasing}} Filipino artistic design and are evident from cave dwellings all over the country. Among these are mostly anthropomorphic <b>earthenware</b> jars dating from c. 5BC to 225AD. Weaving was mostly done by women, using fibers from abaca, pineapple, cotton, and bark to make clothes, rugs and hats. Baskets were mostly utilized to carry grain and other foods.|$|E
5|$|The six {{pieces of}} painted Italian maiolica, or painted and tin-glazed <b>earthenware,</b> are all {{larger than the}} average, and there are none of the dishes that {{are the most common}} maiolica shape. The {{earliest}} piece is a large statue of Fortuna standing on a dolphin, holding a sail, by Giovanni della Robbia, made in Florence about 1500–10. This is a rare representative of the Early to High Italian Renaissance in the bequest.|$|E
5|$|The {{technology}} of oil transportation has evolved alongside the oil industry. Although human {{use of oil}} reaches to prehistory, the first modern commercial exploitation dates back to James Young's manufacture of paraffin in 1850. In the early 1850s, oil began to be exported from Upper Burma, then a British colony. The oil was moved in <b>earthenware</b> vessels to the river bank where it was then poured into boat holds for transportation to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Burial 68 {{was found}} in the centre of the Group 18 plaza. The corpse was poorly preserved, it was laid out on its back with the skull towards the north. The remains were covered with small pieces of {{limestone}} mixed with brown soil. A piece of the upper jaw indicated that the remains were those of a child aged between 5 and 10 years old. Four ceramic pieces were deposited as an offering; two plates, an <b>earthenware</b> bowl and a bowl. Burial 68 is dated to the Late Preclassic.|$|E
5|$|Group 18 Structure 2 is on {{the east}} side of the plaza. Its {{earliest}} phase dates to the Late Preclassic. The Preclassic remains consist of a low north wall running east-west. A later construction phase was built over this. It consisted of a rectangular platform that supported a bench. A small pyrite disc was found near the front wall. Obsidian prismatic blades were found on top of the platform, together with pieces of a thin <b>earthenware</b> bowl. Burial 69 was found in front of the base of the platform.|$|E
5|$|Artists were {{classified}} as artisans since they were nonagricultural laborers who manufactured and decorated objects. The philosopher Wang Fu argued that urban society exploited the contributions of food-producing farmers while able-bodied men in the cities wasted their time (among other listed pursuits) crafting miniature plaster carts, <b>earthenware</b> statues of dogs, horses, and human figures of singers and actors, and children's toys. However, during Eastern Han some scholar-officials began engaging in crafts originally reserved for artisans, such as mechanical engineering. Emperor Ling commissioned the official Cai Yong (132192 CE) to paint portraits and produce eulogies for five generations of the prominent Yang clan of officials and military officers. This is the first recorded instance in China where a scholar-official was commissioned to write eulogies and paint portraits in conjunction, instead of relying on skilled artisans to do the painting.|$|E
5|$|Ceramics lend {{themselves}} to circular motifs, whether radial or tangential. Bowls or plates can be decorated inside or out with radial stripes; these may be partly figurative, representing stylised leaves or flower petals, while circular bands can run around a bowl or jug. Patterns of these types were employed on Islamic ceramics from the Ayyubid period, 13thcentury. Radially symmetric flowers with, say, 6 petals {{lend themselves}} to increasingly stylised geometric designs which can combine geometric simplicity with recognisably naturalistic motifs, brightly coloured glazes, and a radial composition that ideally suits circular crockery. Potters often chose patterns suited {{to the shape of}} the vessel they were making. Thus an unglazed <b>earthenware</b> water flask from Aleppo {{in the shape of a}} vertical circle (with handles and neck above) is decorated with a ring of moulded braiding around an Arabic inscription with a small 8-petalled flower at the centre.|$|E
5|$|Japanese pottery {{is one of}} the country's oldest {{art forms}} dating to the neolithic period, and some of the world's oldest <b>earthenware</b> from about 14,000BC has been {{discovered}} in Japan. Early pottery objects were made of clay, unglazed and without ornamentation. Later, during the Jōmon, Yayoi and Kofun periods, simple patterned designs and molded ornamentations were added. Such early techniques were formed by coiling or scratching and firing pieces at low temperatures. High-fired Korean Sue ware, and with it the pottery wheel, arrived in Japan around the 6th century, marking the beginning of major technological advances imported from the mainland. Stoneware originated in Japan with the development of green-glazed and other color glazed pottery {{in the second half of}} the 7th century. The oldest item in this list is a green-glazed funerary pot from the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Pottery urn: The first {{evidence}} of pottery urn dating from about 7000 BC {{comes from the}} early Jiahu site, where a total of 32 burial urns are found, another early finds are in Laoguantai, Shaanxi. There are about 700 burial urns unearthed over the Yangshao (5000–3000 BC) areas and consisting more than 50 varieties of form and shape. The burial urns were used mainly for children, but also sporadically for adults, {{as shown in the}} finds at Yichuan, Lushan and Zhengzhou in Henan. A secondary burials containing bones from child or adult are found in the urns in Hongshanmiao, Henan. Small hole was drilled in most of the child and adult burial urns, and is believed to enable the spirit to access. It is recorded in the Classic of Rites that the <b>earthenware</b> coffins were used in the time of legendary period, the tradition of burying in pottery urns lasted until the Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD) when it gradually disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Ceramic {{that were}} {{imported}} to Gedi represent either {{direct or indirect}} trade with China, South Asia, and the Islamic world. Islamic pottery found at Gedi was wheel spun, glazed, and kiln fired, which includes sgraffiato, Yemeni black on yellow ceramics, and figured wares frequently depicting floral designs on blue and white panels. Sgraffiato is red-bodied <b>earthenware</b> with yellow or green glaze that was common in modern-day Iraq from the ninth to the sixteenth century. A type of polychrome stoneware from the sixteenth century characterized by grey, green, and brown glazes may {{have been made in}} Persia or India as an attempted imitation of Chinese porcelain. Another type of partially grey glazed bowls with circular decorations on their interior is believed to come from Indochina since the disappearance of the style coincides with the Thai conquest of the region in AD 1467. Various types of Chinese pottery also appear at Gedi, including celadon and blue and white porcelain, which were found in large enough volumes to assume that {{a significant portion of the}} population had access to higher quality wares, while sherds were also found inlayed in the mosques.|$|E
5|$|In Bengal and South India, Shashthi is worshipped on {{the sixth}} day after {{childbirth}} and on Aranya-Shashthi (also called Jamai-Shashthi), the sixth day of the bright fortnight of the Hindu month of Jyeshtha. Her worship can be performed in the house, where she is symbolised as an <b>earthenware</b> pitcher; she may also be worshipped outdoors in a natural, open space consecrated to her, termed a shashthitala. In honour of Shashthi, women tie a stone in a small rag to the branch of a tree in the shasthitala: a mother does this to ask for long life for her child, while a barren woman does so to entreat the goddess to aid her in conceiving. The vrata (ritual) performed {{on the day of}} Jamai-Shashthi is also prescribed to be performed by pregnant women at least once on any Monday, Tuesday, Friday or Saturday in the month of Jyestha. Dough images of Shashthi and her black cat are prepared and worshipped, along with a water pitcher with a banyan tree branch near it. Betel nuts and leaves, fruits, sweets and kheer are offered to her in units of six. In North India, Shashthi is worshipped {{in the form of the}} banyan tree, which is sacred to her.|$|E
5|$|Structure 4 is {{an unusual}} {{combination}} of temple and palace. It is situated on the southeast side of Plaza 2. The structure consists of a central pyramidal base flanked by two attached range structures. The pyramidal base is topped by a shrine containing three rooms, the final room of the three is circular. The temple has three steep stairways flanked by balustrades. The main stairway ascends directly from the plaza, those on either side are perpendicular to the main stairway. The balustrade of each stairway terminates at the top in a vertical panel. The temple facade is in good condition although {{the roof of the}} temple is missing. The range structures are unequal in size and each contains a single long room atop a low platform. The facade of each of these rooms once possessed a row of columns although only stumps remain in situ. This temple-palace is K'iche' in style and has been identified with the Nija'ib' lineage of the K'iche', being very similar to the Temple of Awilix at Q'umarkaj. A tomb was excavated in Structure 4, it consisted of a complete skeleton with associated offerings that included two tripod <b>earthenware</b> bowls, one with duck effigies, a tripod incense burner, a flint knife, nine obsidian knives, five jade beads and some fragments of gold.|$|E
5|$|The fort was {{surveyed}} {{and described}} by R.G. Collingwood in his Archaeology of Roman Britain, 1930, where {{he noted the}} fort's uniquely skewed shape and extraordinary set of defensive ramparts on the western, uphill side. Pottery excavated in the 1950s suggested that the fort was constructed in 122 AD, {{at the same time}} as Hadrian's Wall. A survey in 2007–8 by English Heritage showed a large Roman civilian settlement or vicus to the north and west of the fort. Artefacts found include coins, pottery, glass, objects made of jet, and inscribed stones. In 2012, the University of Durham carried out a geophysics survey as part of an English Heritage project. In the absence of a full excavation, archaeologists have exploited the diggings of moles to uncover Roman artefacts by sifting earth thrown up by the animals in their molehills. Finds include fragments of terra sigillata (Samian ware, Roman table pottery); rim fragments of serving bowls and <b>earthenware</b> pots; a bead made of jet; some iron nails; and a bronze dolphin from the bath house, most likely the handle of an instrument like a strigil or razor.|$|E
5|$|During the Song period, {{there was}} a great deal of {{organized}} labor and bureaucracy involved in the extraction of resources from the various provinces in China. The production of sulfur, which the Chinese called 'vitriol liquid', was extracted from pyrite and used for pharmaceutical purposes as well as for the creation of gunpowder. This was done by roasting iron pyrites, converting the sulphide to oxide, as the ore was piled up with coal briquettes in an <b>earthenware</b> furnace with a type of still-head to send the sulfur over as vapour, after which it would solidify and crystallize. The historical text of the Song Shi (History of the Song, compiled in 1345 AD) stated that the major producer of sulfur in the Tang and Song dynasties was the Jin Zhou sub-provincial administrative region (modern Linfen in southern Shanxi). The bureaucrats appointed to the region managed the industrial processing and sale of it, and the amount created and distributed from the years 996 to 997 alone was 405,000 jin (roughly 200 tons). It was recorded that in 1076 AD the Song government held a strict commercial monopoly on sulfur production, and if dye houses and government workshops sold their products to private dealers in the black market, they were subject to meted penalties by government authorities. Even before this point, in 1067 AD, the Song government had issued an edict that the people living in Shanxi and Hebei were forbidden to sell foreigners any products containing saltpetre and sulfur. This act by the Song government displayed their fears of the grave potential of gunpowder weapons being developed by Song China's territorial enemies as well (i.e. the Tanguts and Khitans).|$|E
5|$|Edward I had {{the major}} {{ingredients}} for gunpowder shipped to Stirling in 1304, probably {{to produce a}} form of Greek fire, to be shot into the town in <b>earthenware</b> pots by siege engines. The English probably had projectile gunpowder artillery in the 1320s and the Scots by the next decade. The first clear recorded use in Britain was when Edward III besieged Berwick in 1333, where it was used alongside mechanical siege engines. The first use by the Scots was probably against Stirling Castle in 1341. Gunpowder artillery began to fully replace mechanical engines in the late fourteenth century. The Stewarts attempted to follow the French and English crowns in building up an artillery train. The abortive siege of Roxburgh in 1436 under James I was probably the first conflict in which the Scots made serious use of artillery. James II had a royal gunner and received gifts of artillery from the continent, including two giant bombards made for Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, one of which, Mons Meg, still survives. Although these were probably already outdated on the continent, they represented impressive military technology when they reached Scotland. James II enthusiasm for artillery cost him his life and demonstrated some {{of the dangers of}} early artillery, when a gun exploded at the siege of Roxburgh in 1460. James III also experienced ill-fortune, when artillery sent from Sigismund, Archduke of Austria sank in a storm en route to Scotland in 1481. James IV brought in experts from France, Germany and the Netherlands and established a foundry in 1511. Edinburgh Castle had a house of artillery where visitors could see cannon cast for what became a formidable train, allowing him to send cannon to France and Ireland and to quickly subdue Norham Castle in the Flodden campaign. However, his 18 heavy artillery pieces had to be drawn by 400 oxen and slowed the advancing Scots army, proving ineffective against the longer range and smaller calibre English guns at the Battle of Flodden.|$|E
25|$|<b>Earthenware</b> pottery {{including}} tin-glazed pottery, Victorian majolica, Delftware and faience, {{is made of}} clays or earths {{that give}} a soft paste. <b>Earthenware</b> is opaque, with a relatively coarse texture, while porcelain is semi-transparent, with a fine texture of minute crystals suspended in a transparent glassy ground.|$|E
25|$|The same {{techniques}} {{are used to}} paint {{the various types of}} porcelain and <b>earthenware,</b> both underglaze and overglaze, but different pigments are used due to the different body characteristics and firing temperatures.

25|$|A British chemist named John Frederic Daniell {{found a way}} {{to solve}} the {{hydrogen}} bubble problem in the Voltaic Pile by using a second electrolyte to consume the hydrogen produced by the first. In 1836 he invented the Daniell cell, which consisted of a copper pot filled with a copper sulfate solution, in which was immersed an unglazed <b>earthenware</b> container filled with sulfuric acid and a zinc electrode. The <b>earthenware</b> barrier was porous, which allowed ions to pass through but kept the solutions from mixing.|$|E
