6000|$|... "Yes, {{although}} it was rather short. But, say, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> fellows <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Plum's father?" [...] went on Ben Basswood, earnestly.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I shall not. There will {{be people}} there whom I don't know, and I don't want to know. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> him, Mrs. Finn?" ...|$|R

6000|$|BLAYNE. That's {{just what}} he would do, damn him. Oh! I say, Anthony, you pretend to know everything. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Gaddy? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You couldn't hide it." [...] Graham {{smiled at}} him. [...] "It wasn't your fault I got frost-bitten, anyway. But <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the specimens?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Isabel {{thought her}} a very {{attractive}} person, but nevertheless spoke with a certain abruptness in reply to this speech. [...] "From whom <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Bartle, pausing, {{with one}} hand on his back. [...] "Then there's {{something}} in the wind--there's something in the wind. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> anything <b>about</b> what the old squire means to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was {{not only}} that, added Tom; 'but I've more to say to you, while one {{can be sure of}} a quiet moment. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> that place?' and he pointed {{in the direction of the}} Vintry Mill.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do I? It's likely enough. I hate Fabio d'Ascoli and Maddalena Lomi--singly as man and woman, doubly as man and wife. Stop! I'll {{tell you}} what you want to know directly. Only answer me another {{question}} or two first. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> anything <b>about</b> her health?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{friendly}} Mitchy {{was also}} much amused. [...] "By Jove, the most awful things ARE found! <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> old Randage {{and what his}} executors have just come across? The most abominable--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Inclining to fast, with a {{work from}} leg. Comes with the arm about three inches or so. He {{used to be}} nasty on a wet wicket. Oh, by-the-way, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Long Norton?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> her jewels?" [...] Mrs. Hittaway was {{alluding}} here to {{the report}} which had reached her as to Lizzie's debt to Harter and Benjamin when she married Sir Florian; but Lord Fawn of course thought of the diamond necklace.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe it}} does," [...] the other said, [...] "especially when the liquid {{is almost as}} hot as one is, one's self. Will you sit down on that box? Chairs are luxuries {{that we do not}} indulge in here. Well, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> a move?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good afternoon, Prickly Porky. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> {{the news}} <b>about</b> Chatterer?" [...] said Peter, talking very fast, {{for he was}} quite out of breath.|$|R

6000|$|Babbitt drove, {{not at all}} {{carefully}} or fussily, sliding viciously past trucks, {{ignoring the}} truckmen's curses, to the City Hall; he stopped with a grind of wheels against the curb, and ran up the marble steps {{to the office of}} the Hon. Mr. Lucas Prout, the mayor. He bribed the mayor's doorman with a dollar; he was instantly inside, demanding, [...] "You remember me, Mr. Prout? Babbitt--vice-president of the Boosters--campaigned for you? Say, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> poor Riesling? Well, I want an order on the warden or whatever you call um of the City Prison to take me back and see him. Good. Thanks." ...|$|E
6000|$|His studied air {{of mystery}} piqued and drew on his victim. Gwendoline knew {{in her own}} heart she ought to go at once; her own dignity demanded it, and she should consult her dignity. But still, she couldn't help longing to know what Nevitt's half-hints and innuendoes might mean. After all, she was a woman! [...] "Oh, do tell me," [...] she cried, {{clasping}} her hands in suspense once more; [...] "what <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Mr. Kelmscott? I'm not engaged to him; I don't want to know for that, but--" [...] she broke down, blushing crimson, and Montague Nevitt, gazing fixedly at her delicate peach-like cheek, remarked to himself how extremely well that blush became her.|$|E
6000|$|She {{was then}} taken into a parlour, {{so small that}} her first {{conviction}} was of its being only a passage-room to something better, and she {{stood for a moment}} expecting to be invited on; but when she saw there was no other door, and that there were signs of habitation before her, she called back her thoughts, reproved herself, and grieved lest they should have been suspected. Her mother, however, could not stay long enough to suspect anything. She was gone again to the street-door, to welcome William. [...] "Oh! my dear William, how glad I am to see you. But <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the Thrush? She is gone out of harbour already; three days before we had any thought of it; and I do not know what I am to do about Sam's things, they will never be ready in time; for she may have her orders to-morrow, perhaps. It takes me quite unawares. And now you must be off for Spithead too. Campbell has been here, quite in a worry about you; and now what shall we do? I thought to have had such a comfortable evening with you, and here everything comes upon me at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{came to see}} you, and got supper {{three or}} four miles back. I'm Dearham, of Winter & Dearham. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> {{probably}} <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Austin, [...] "if {{you will}} tell me what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> already <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Jefferson it might make the way a little plainer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{just thought}} I'd ask <b>you</b> if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> that Blackie Crowden yet," [...] remarked the gardener from Hope, as he approached.|$|R

5000|$|His {{articles}} consistently {{emphasized the}} use of logic in approaching life and solving problems. However, the logic presented in his columns was often unorthodox. As an example, in an article entitled,"Why Men are Superior to Women," [...] Crane offered the argument {{in support of his}} thesis, [...] "How many women <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about,</b> sic who were shepherds?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor I, Dave. I {{never did}} like that fellow, and I don't like his father, either. By the way, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> {{anything}} more <b>about</b> the farm {{that belongs to}} Professor Potts?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Winifred, as if I had not sat up till twelve {{last night}} laying them before Albinia. How sick the poor child must be of our arguments, {{when there is}} no real objection, and she is so much attached! <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> these connexions of his? Did you not write to Mrs. Nugent? I wish she were at home.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> them," [...] said Lady Tyrrell. [...] "Most {{delightful}} people, whom Mrs. Duncombe {{met on the}} Righi. He is a Cambridge professor." ...|$|R

5000|$|And {{inasmuch as}} the {{following}} conversation also has been recorded by Damis as having been held upon this occasion {{with regard to the}} mythological animals and fountains and men met with in India, I must not leave it out, for there is much to be gained by neither believing nor yet disbelieving everything. Accordingly Apollonius asked the question, whether there was there an animal called the man-eater (martichoras); and Iarchas replied: [...] "And what <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> the make of this animal? For it is probable that there is some account given of its shape." [...] "There are," [...] replied Apollonius, [...] "tall stories current which I cannot believe; for they say that the creature has four feet, and that his head resembles that of a man, but that in size it is comparable to a lion; while the tail of this animal puts out hairs a cubit long and sharp as thorns, which it shoots like arrows at those who hunt it." ...|$|E
5000|$|After Ott {{become the}} {{ambassador}} to Japan in April 1938, Sorge had a breakfast with him everyday {{where the two}} discussed in detail German-Japanese relations, and Sorge sometimes drafted the cables that Ott sent under his name to Berlin.

6000|$|... "I shall simply {{tell her}} that you were deeply {{offended}} at something <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> Captain Horton, and had resolved never to see him again-- never to forgive him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, Miss Layard, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> {{the wreck}} of the Trondhjem, and how those foreign sailors saw the light in my {{workshop}} and brought Mr. Fregelius to the Abbey." ...|$|R
