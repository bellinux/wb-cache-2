2500|$|Most {{oscilloscopes}} {{allow for}} probe attenuation factors, displaying the effective sensitivity at the probe tip. Historically, some auto-sensing circuitry used <b>indicator</b> <b>lamps</b> behind translucent {{windows in the}} panel to illuminate {{different parts of the}} sensitivity scale. To do so, the probe connectors (modified BNCs) had an extra contact to define the probe's attenuation. (A certain value of resistor, connected to ground, [...] "encodes" [...] the attenuation.) Because probes wear out, and because the auto-sensing circuitry is not compatible between different makes of oscilloscope, auto-sensing probe scaling is not foolproof. Likewise, manually setting the probe attenuation is prone to user error and it is a common mistake to have the probe scaling set incorrectly; resultant voltage readings can then be wrong by a factor of 10.|$|E

50|$|A neon bulb, {{often used}} as an <b>indicator</b> <b>lamp</b> in appliances, {{consists}} of a glass bulb containing two electrodes, separated by an inert gas such as neon at low pressure.

50|$|An ARI-equipped radio would {{illuminate}} an <b>indicator</b> <b>lamp</b> to {{show that}} this function was in force. Most such radios would use this function further to help users search for ARI broadcasts. In the Radio Data System environment, the TP signal is equivalent to this basic function.|$|R

50|$|A {{malfunction}} <b>indicator</b> <b>lamp</b> (MIL), {{or check}} engine light, is a tell-tale that a computerized engine-management system uses {{to indicate a}} malfunction.

25|$|All stops are request stops, {{made only}} on {{passenger}}s' requests. In order {{to leave a}} tram at a given stop, a passenger must push a special button in the tram.

50|$|Another {{modification}} {{made to the}} PDP-10 by CompuServe engineers was {{the replacement}} of the hundreds of incandescent <b>indicator</b> <b>lamps</b> on the KI10 processor cabinet with LED lamp modules. The cost of the conversion was easily offset by the cost savings in electric consumption, the reduction of heat, and the manpower required to replace burned-out lamps. Digital followed this step all over the world. The picture on the right hand side shows the light panel of the MF10 memory which is contemporaneous with the KI10 CPU. This item is part of a computer museum, and was populated with LEDs in 2008 for demonstration purposes only. There were no similar banks of <b>indicator</b> <b>lamps</b> on KL and KS processors.|$|E
50|$|Air {{flow meters}} may fail or wear out. When this happens, engine {{performance}} will often decrease significantly, engine emissions will be greatly increased, and usually the Malfunction <b>Indicator</b> <b>Lamp</b> (MIL) will illuminate. In most countries in Europe, and in {{places in the}} United States where emissions inspections are obligatory, a lit MIL is cause for a vehicle to fail the inspection. Some engines do not idle with an air flow meter failure.|$|R
50|$|The {{results of}} the POST may be {{displayed}} on a panel {{that is part of}} the device, output to an external device, or stored for future retrieval by a diagnostic tool. Since a self-test might detect that the system's usual human-readable display is non-functional, an <b>indicator</b> <b>lamp</b> or a speaker may be provided to show error codes as a sequence of flashes or beeps. In addition to running tests, the POST process may also set the initial state of the device from firmware.|$|R

50|$|Instrumentation {{consists}} of an analog speedometer and tachometer and basic <b>indicator</b> <b>lamps,</b> incorporated under a tinted window, and a single tripmeter.

50|$|Some systems use {{shelving}} {{with red}} and green lights and a switch {{at the back of}} the card slot.

Leaving the card pulled partway out leaves the indicator green, showing the dispatcher that unit is available. Is anyone available? The lights are supposed to give the dispatch staff a snapshot of their resource situation.|$|R
