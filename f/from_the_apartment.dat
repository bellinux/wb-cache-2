5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> {{he shares}} with his hypochondriac mother Winifred, Seymour fetches his odd-looking, potted plant, but Mushnick is unimpressed by its sickly, {{drooping}} look. However, when Fouch suggests that Audrey Jr.'s uniqueness might attract {{people from all over the}} world to see it, Mushnick gives Seymour one week to revive it. Seymour has already discovered that the usual kinds of plant food do not nourish his strange hybrid and that every night at sunset the plant's leaves open up. When Seymour accidentally pricks his finger on another thorny plant, Audrey Jr. opens wider, eventually causing Seymour to discover that the plant craves blood. After that, each night Seymour nurses his creation with blood from his fingers. Although he feels increasingly listless, Audrey Jr. begins to grow and the shop's revenues increase due to the curious customers who are lured in to see the plant.|$|E
5|$|In St. Louis, Anson Stokes, an apathetic {{employee}} at a self storage facility, is yelled at by his boss {{to clean out}} an old and dusty storage locker. To his surprise, he finds a woman wrapped in a rug. His boss comes to check on him; while he is yelling for Anson, his mouth disappears. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) speak with the boss, Jay Gilmore, after surgery to fix his mouth, which has left him disfigured and with a speech impediment. They question Stokes' brother Leslie at their mobile home, which inexplicably has a large boat in its tiny front yard. The woman from the storage container is in the Stokes brothers' kitchen. Mulder and Scully search the container and find old antiques {{and a picture of}} the previous owner with the woman <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment.</b>|$|E

25|$|Gender/ Sexuality- All of {{the major}} {{characters}} in the novel are female.

25|$|The {{relationship}} between Jones and Rosario had {{been marked by}} domestic violence, and eventually she ended it and he moved out. However, he had in early July 2012 twice attempted {{to break into the}} apartment, even after Rosario changed the locks. Hedgepeth drove her roommate to court to get a protective order that required Jones to stay away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment.</b> Jones reportedly resented Hedgepeth's influence over his former girlfriend, and at one point reportedly threatened during a phone conversation with Hedgepeth to kill her if he could not get back together with Rosario.|$|E
25|$|The {{view of the}} German police {{was that}} Duggan had arrived at that stretch of road after running 5km <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment.</b> Duggan's family complained {{that the police had}} failed to {{establish}} that. Other allegations included that he had spent the night at the nearby LaRouche offices and ran from there to the road, and that he had run onto the road from a car. Forensic reports commissioned by Erica Duggan suggested that he may have died elsewhere and been moved onto the road after the fact, a position the coroner rejected in 2015.|$|E

Previous work evaluating {{the use of}} the Kinect for in-home gait assessment in a lab setting has shown the potential of this approach. In this work, a single Kinect sensor and computer have been deployed in five apartments, two of which contain multiple residents, in an independent living facility for older adults.

25|$|Furthermore, Arkan {{could be}} seen riding around Belgrade in his pink Cadillac and {{gambling}} on roulette in casinos all over the country, from Belgrade and nearby Pančevo to Sveti Stefan and Portorož. Following a game of poker in a private apartment at Ive Lole Ribara Street, Bečići, an elevator altercation started with a tenant <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment</b> building. Arkan reportedly broke the man's arm after beating him with a gun. He couldn't avoid being charged this time and the trial saw an interesting exchange {{between him and the}} judge – during the pre-session identification Arkan stated he was employed by the Secretariat of Internal Affairs. When this was challenged by the prosecutor, Arkan produced a document about a mortgage loan that he obtained from the Federal State Security for his house at Ljutice Bogdana Street. He ended up receiving a six-month sentence, which he served at the Belgrade Central Prison.|$|E
25|$|Faint bloodstains in {{the main}} hallway of the {{apartment}} indicate {{at least one of}} the victims had been attacked as he entered the apartment. Authorities later said that the presence of a blood-soaked bath towel and paper towels in the bathroom suggest Rodger had attempted to clean the hallway after each murder. The bodies of Wang and Hong were found in their shared bedroom, whereas Chen's body was found in the bathroom. The positioning of the bodies suggested each victim had entered the apartment separately before being murdered, and that Rodger had made efforts to conceal the bodies of the first two victims by covering them with blankets, towels, and clothing. Police removed a knife, a hammer, and two machetes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartment,</b> but they later determined that two knives recovered from a backpack found in Rodger's car were the weapons used to kill the apartment victims.|$|E
