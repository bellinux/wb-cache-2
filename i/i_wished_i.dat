2500|$|Beresford {{wrote to}} Fitzwilliam on 22 June that his {{character}} had been unjustly attacked: [...] "Direct and specific charges I could fairly have met and refuted, but crooked and undefined insinuations against private character, through {{the pretext of}} official discussion, your Lordship must allow, are the weapons of a libeller". Fitzwilliam replied the next day that domestic matters took charge of his attention but on 28 June that he let Beresford know he was now in town and [...] "As I could not misunderstand the object of your letter, I have only to signify that I am ready to attend your call". Rumours of the impending duel leaked and Fitzwilliam was [...] "obliged to quit the house...hastily in the morning, for fear of arrest by the police". His second, Lord George Cavendish, met Beresford's second (Sir George Montgomery) on 28 June and debated an apology by Fitzwilliam. His proposed apology was not acceptable to Beresford. Their first arena, Marylebone fields, was crowded with prospective spectators so they moved to a field near Paddington. As Beresford and Fitzwilliam were taking their marks a magistrate ran onto the field and arrested Fitzwilliam. Fitzwilliam said to Beresford [...] "that we have been prevented from finishing this business in the manner <b>I</b> <b>wished,</b> <b>I</b> have no scruple to make an apology". Beresford accepted and they shook hands, with Fitzwilliam saying [...] "Now, thank God, there is a complete end to my Irish administration" [...] and hoped that [...] "whenever they met it {{might be on the}} footing of friends". Burke wrote to Lord John Cavendish on 1 July that [...] "it is happy, that a Virtuous man has escaped with Life and honour—and that his reputation for spirit and humanity, and true dignity must stand higher than ever, if higher it could stand".|$|E
