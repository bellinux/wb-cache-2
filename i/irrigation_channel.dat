5|$|Crossing into Afghanistan, {{the group}} found fresh water in an <b>irrigation</b> <b>channel</b> by a deserted hamlet. Albeit teeming with leeches, the water saved the group from dying of thirst. Marching {{for another two}} days, they reached the {{vicinity}} of Herat, where they made contact with Afghan authorities. Unsure what reception awaited them, von Hentig sent Barkatullah, an Islamic scholar of some fame, to advise the governor that the expedition had arrived and was bearing the Kaiser's message and gifts for the Emir. The governor sent a grand welcome, with noblemen bearing cloths and gifts, a caravan of servants, and a column of hundred armed escorts. The expedition was invited into the city as guests of the Afghan government. With von Hentig in the lead in his Cuirassiers uniform, they entered Herat on 24 August, in a procession welcomed by Turkish troops. They were housed at the Emir's provincial palace. They were officially met by the governor {{a few days later}} when, according to British agents, von Hentig showed him the Turkish Sultan's proclamation of jihad and announced the Kaiser's promise to recognise Afghan sovereignty and provide German assistance. The Kaiser also promised to grant territory to Afghanistan as far north as Samarkand in Russian Turkestan and as far into India as Bombay.|$|E

500|$|The {{source is}} disputed, {{tradition}} holds that it rises at an artesian well, the Fuente de Cella, {{at the base}} of the Sierra Albarracín in Teruel province. [...] The well is surrounded by an elliptical parapet wall built by the Italian engineer Domingo Ferrari. It is now thought that the stretch of river between Cella and Monreal del Campo is the remains of an 18th-century canal which was cut to drain the Laguna Cañizar at Villarquemado. It is currently accepted that the Jiloca raises at the Ojos (Eyes) of Monreal, [...] from the town. [...] These are a series of ponds linked by channels. From Monreal the river flows northwards and near Luco de Jiloca (Calamocha), the Jiloca is joined by its only tributary, the Pancrudo, which rises [...] away in the Sierra de la Costera. [...] From this point there is an <b>irrigation</b> <b>channel</b> which waters a small valley near Daroca.|$|E

The phytoplankton assemblage in Lake Loskop during this sampling period was dominated by the phytoplankton Ceratium hirundinella, with the highest biovolume of 12. 1 mm 3 l- 1 recorded in late summer during January 2010. From the data generated the algae assemblage showed a clear trend in the two channels during the study period and also among sampling stations. The filamentous macroalgae Cladophora glomerata dominated the phytobenthos of the two <b>irrigation</b> <b>channels</b> during the whole sampling period. However, a much higher biovolumes (8. 5; 6. 3 mm 3 l- 1) of Cladophora glomerata and total phosphates were observed in the long and short <b>irrigation</b> <b>channels</b> during lake overturn in the months of March and September, while much lower average biovolumes (2. 4; 1. 5 mm 3 l- 1) were recorded during the summer months. The dominance of the water column phytoplankton assemblage in the two <b>irrigation</b> <b>channels</b> by Ceratium hirundinella, Fragillaria crotonesis, Closteruim stellenboschense and Closteruim polystictum during autumn and spring was in relationship with the observed lake overturn.
