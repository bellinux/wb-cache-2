40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the modeling, the design, and the {{construction}} of a new concept slip-synchronous permanent-magnet (PM) wind generator for direct-drive <b>direct</b> <b>grid</b> <b>connection.</b> This generator is a variation of the conventional PM induction generator concept as proposed and analyzed in literature. The use of nonoverlap windings is proposed for the first time for this type of generator. Combined analytical and finite-element calculation and design-optimization methods are developed and used in the design of the generator. Load torque ripple and no-load cogging torque are identified as very important design parameters and are minimized to an absolute minimum in the design optimization.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a modular PMSG and {{converter}} topology, suitable for utility interface of large wind turbine has been has been explored. A comprehensive analysis on different sinusoidal {{pulse width modulation}} has been performed an Matlab/Simulink® environment. Through analytical calculation, it is proved that multilevel converters can have higher energy efficiency compared to traditional two-level inverters. The possible solutions to draw sinusoidal current from the generator windings, where they are interfaced with single phase diode rectifiers are investigated and the proposed solution is simulated {{and the results are}} confirmed by laboratory tests. The laboratory results show that the combination of a single phase diode rectifier with a boost chopper which operates at continuous mode of operation presents a cost effective solution for reducing the torque ripple and controlling power factor of the generator. Moreover, a mathematical modeling of the boost chopper interconnected with a single phase diode rectifier performed and an algorithm for maximum power point tracking without measuring wind speed has been proposed. The algorithm is simulated and the results show satisfactory performance. The algorithm is implemented in dSPACE, but due the limited available RAM the dSPACE could not operate satisfactory. A more powerful DSP card is needed to implement the algorithm. The Robicon Perfect Harmony drive has been chosen to investigate the possibility of utilizing available VFD for <b>direct</b> <b>grid</b> <b>connection</b> of wind energy systems. The simulation results demonstrate that in order to utilize this drive some modifications must be done in the topology of the drive. It is shown that the capacitances of the dc-links are a decisive factor for <b>direct</b> <b>grid</b> <b>connection</b> of PMSG. A value of less than 4. 5 mF for a 23 -level multilevel converter causes an increase in the third harmonic of the output voltage of the multilevel converter which makes it unacceptable for <b>direct</b> <b>grid</b> <b>connection.</b> A laboratory test is performed on a 50 kW PMSG to investigate the voltage stress in the generator coils when the output voltage of the PMSG is in maximum amplitude. It was observed that the amplitude of the voltage stress was less than induced voltage in each coil, but high dv/dt appears across each coil which may finally destroy the insulation. It is supposed that the switching functions of the IGBTs in the inverter side cause the problem and by using a multilevel converter instead of two-level inverter a smoother transition for the voltage stress from one level to another can be achieved. More practical tests are needed to accurately determine the level of voltage stress. Also an alternative topology for the grid side inverter has been proposed to reduce the losses and improve the THD profile of the converter output voltage. It is suggested to do analytical and practical tests on the proposed topology. All the simulations have been performed in Matlab/Simulink environment...|$|E

40|$|The {{investment}} in wind farms is increasing rapidly {{and in many}} aspects the industry is maturing. Instead of connecting single wind turbine or small wind farms to the distribution network, the energy companies and manufactures are connecting large wind farms to the transmission network. These farms can contain 200 plus turbines and have a rated capacity of greater than 500 MW up to several GW. Providing proper protection for these farms is a major challenge. In the UK, any wind farm rated above 100 MW is required to obey the grid code which means the protection consideration will be <b>directed</b> for <b>grid</b> <b>connection</b> and will be different from wind farms which {{are connected to the}} distribution network. In addition to the considerations of a grid connected generator, the particular characteristics of the types of turbine involved add further complications. This paper reviews the existing technologies used for protecting large wind farms and how they will affect the protection of the local transmission feeders and busbars. It is a challenge for the wind farm's protection to achieve 120 ms fault clearance for the transmission network and 800 ms fir a back up protection. Since wind turbines have different characteristics to those of conventional power plant, the paper discusses the special features and settings for the protection schemes used for large wind farms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Due to the {{variable}} nature {{of renewable energy}} resources and power demand by consumers, {{it is difficult to}} operate a power system installed with only one type of renewable energy resource. Grid-based renewable generation may be the only solution to overcome this problem. The conventional approach based on a low-voltage converter with power frequency transformer is commonly employed for grid connection of offshore renewable energy systems. Because of the heavy weight and large size of the transformer, the system can be expensive and complex in terms of installation and maintenance. In this paper, an 11 -kV series connected H-bridge (SCHB) multilevel voltage source converter (VSC) is proposed to achieve a compact and light <b>direct</b> <b>grid</b> <b>connection</b> of renewable energy systems. This paper presents the design, simulation and analysis of a five level (5 L) -SCHB and an eleven level (11 L) -SCHB VSC for 11 -kV grid-based renewable energy systems.

40|$|This {{master project}} is a further {{investigation}} of the topics covered in the specializa- tion project Laboratory platform for PM machine drive study - Adaptive Torque Estimation. Permanent magnet synchronous machines have seen an increased popularity in recent years. Some market analyses indicate that the industry is experiencing a gradual shift from induction machines to permanent magnet machines. The ma- chine offer several advantages over the inductions machine. The rotor losses are minimal, {{as there is no}} excitation current in the rotor. Thus the overall efficiency is improved. The machine offers higher torque density, lower weight, and higher torquetoinertiaratio,whichmayimprovethedynamicperformance. Althoughthe permanentmagnetmaterialsareexpensive,thelowoverallmaterialusagesuggests lower production costs. In order to obtain the aforementioned advantages a power electronic converter is required to control the machine. Although many of the induction machines found in industry are supplied by <b>direct</b> <b>grid</b> <b>connection,</b> the cost savings associated with the increased efficiency of applying a motor drive is changing this trend. Thus the requirement of a motor drive should no longer be considered a disadvantage of the synchronous machine alone. A lot of research effort has been put into developing control algorithms for electri- cal machines. In many cases the induction machine has been the initial study case, and later on the algorithms have been adapted to suit different machines. In order to accurately evaluate the performance of various motor control algo- rithms, a laboratory platform of a permanent magnet synchronous motor drive has been designed in this project. Several practical aspect regarding cooling require- ments, safety functions, gate driver design, controller and measurement interface have been considered. The platform is also intended as a base for future research and development. Three different control algorithms, field oriented control, direct torque control, and model predictive control have been evaluated. Additionally different modula- tion techniques for the inverter switches are covered. Theoretical derivations and practical implementation is considered. The operation is evaluated by simulation and laboratory experiments. Regardless of which motor control algorithm is selected, knowledge of the rotor flux position is required for efficient closed loop control. The use of position sen- sors on the motor shaft increases the cost of the drive, and reduces the reliability. In order to address this issue, several position estimation algorithms for sensorless control have been evaluated...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a cost optimal 100 % {{renewable}} energy based system is obtained for Southeast Asia and the Pacific Rim region {{for the year}} 2030 on an hourly resolution for the whole year. For the optimization, the region was divided into 15 sub-regions and three different scenarios were set up based {{on the level of}} high voltage <b>direct</b> current <b>grid</b> <b>connections.</b> The results obtained for a total system levelized cost of electricity showed a decrease from 66. 7 €/MWh in a decentralized scenario to 63. 5 €/MWh for a centralized grid connected scenario. An integrated scenario was simulated to show the benefit of integrating additional demand of industrial gas and desalinated water which provided the system the required flexibility and increased the efficiency of the usage of storage technologies. This was reflected in the decrease of system cost by 9. 5 % and the total electricity generation by 5. 1 %. According to the results, grid integration on a larger scale decreases the total system cost and levelized cost of electricity by reducing the need for storage technologies due to seasonal variations in weather and demand profiles. The intermittency of renewable technologies can be effectively stabilized to satisfy hourly demand at a low cost level. A 100 % {{renewable energy}} based system could be a reality economically and technically in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Rim with the cost assumptions used in this research and it may be more cost competitive than the nuclear and fossil carbon capture and storage (CCS) alternatives...|$|R
