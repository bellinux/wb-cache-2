500|$|There {{is also a}} twin-T {{topology}} {{which has}} practical applications where it is desirable to have the input and output share a common (<b>ground)</b> <b>terminal.</b> [...] This may be, for instance, because the input and output connections are made with co-axial topology. [...] Connecting together an input and output terminal is not allowable with normal bridge topology {{and for this reason}} Twin-T is used where a bridge would otherwise be used for balance or null measurement applications. [...] The topology is also used in the twin-T oscillator as a sine wave generator. [...] The lower part of figure 1.11 shows twin-T topology redrawn to emphasise the connection with bridge topology.|$|E

40|$|Communication and {{information}} exchange play a decisive role in progress and social development. However, {{in many parts}} of the world the communication infrastructure is inadequate and the capacity for on-line exchange of information may not exist. This is true of underdeveloped countries, remote and relatively inaccessible regions, sites of natural disasters, and of all cases where the resources needed to create complex communication systems are limited. The creation of an inexpensive space communications system to service such areas is therefore a high priority task. In addition to a relatively low-cost space segment, an inexpensive space communications systems requires a large number of <b>ground</b> <b>terminals,</b> which must be relatively inexpensive, energy efficient (using power generated by storage batteries, or solar arrays, etc.), small in size, and must not require highly expert maintenance. The <b>ground</b> <b>terminals</b> must be portable, and readily deployable. Communications satellites in geostationary orbit at altitudes of about 36, 000 km are very expensive and require complex and expensive ground stations and launch vehicles. Given current technology, it is categorically impossible to develop inexpensive satellite systems with portable <b>ground</b> <b>terminals</b> using such satellites. To solve the problem of developing an inexpensive satellite communications system that can operate with relatively small ground stations, including portable terminals, we propose to use a system with satellites in low Earth orbit, at an altitude of 900 - 1500 km. Because low orbital satellites are much closer to the Earth than geostationary ones and require vastly less energy expenditure by the satellite and <b>ground</b> <b>terminals</b> for transmission of messages, a system using them is relatively inexpensive. Such a system could use portable <b>ground</b> <b>terminals</b> no more complex than ordinary mobile police radios...|$|R

40|$|It is {{desirable}} to incorporate packet switching capability on-board for future communication satellites.

Thus, {{it is necessary to}} incorporate a congestion control mechanism as part of the on-board processing to smooth and regulate the bursty traffic. Although there are extensive studies on congestion control for both baseband and broadband terrestrial networks, these schemes are not feasible for space based switching networks because of the unique characteristics of satellite link. Here, we propose a new congestion control method for on-board satellite packet switching. This scheme takes into consideration the long propagation delay in satellite link and takes advantage of the the satellite's broadcasting capability. It divides the control between the <b>ground</b> <b>terminals</b> and satellite, but distributes the primary responsibility to <b>ground</b> <b>terminals</b> and only requires minimal hardware resource on-board satellite...|$|R
