40|$|Abstract—Many {{studies have}} {{emphasized}} the importance of resistive exercise to maintain a healthy human body, particular in prevention of weakening of physical strength. Recently, some studies advocated that an application of vibration as a supplementary means in a regular training was effective in encouraging physical strength. Aim of the current study was, therefore, to identify if an application of vibration in a resistive exercise was effective in encouraging physical strength as that in a regular training. A 3 -dimensional virtual lower extremity model for a healthy male and virtual leg-press model were generated and synchronized. Dynamic leg-press exercises on a slide machine with/without <b>extra</b> <b>load</b> and on a footboard with vibration as well as on a slide machine with <b>extra</b> <b>load</b> were analyzed. The results of the current indicated that the application of the vibration on the dynamic leg-press exercise might be not greatly effective in encouraging physical strength, compared with the dynamic leg press exercise with <b>extra</b> <b>load.</b> It was, however, thought that the application of the vibration might be helpful to elderly individuals because the reduced maximum muscle strength appeared by the effect of the vibration may avoid a muscular spasm, which can be driven from a high muscle strength sometimes produced during the leg-press exercise with <b>extra</b> <b>load.</b> Keywords—Resistive exercise, leg-press exercise, muscle strength.

50|$|The same rail {{has been}} tested to 80 t axle {{loadings}} for mainline use, {{and can be used}} in tunnels and other locations where the loading gauge is restricted.

40|$|Much {{functionality}} of today's vehicles runs as {{software on}} embedded computer systems. This includes, for example, automatic climate control and engine control. As the processors necessarily {{are located in}} diffent physical locations inside the vehicle wires must be drawn between processors that need to communicate. Therefore, it is typical to have one or several buses connecting the processors in an embedded computer network, thus creating a distributed system. As {{some parts of the}} system in the car have real-time properties, it is necessary to validate that the real-time properties are upheld in the distributed system. This thesis presents the design and implementation of an adaptive cruise controller (ACC), which is a cruise controller that also keeps a minimum distance to the closest vehicle in front. Further, the performance of the ACC has been evaluated using an existing system-level simulator for distributed real-time systems together with metrics for Quality-of-Control (QoC). The ACC has then been simulated under different scenarios. The scenarios include outside conditions, for example the slope of the road, the behaviour of the vehicle in front, and the desired velocity, as well as internal conditions as adding different amounts of <b>extra</b> <b>load</b> on the processors and the bus. The results show that the functionality of the ACC starts deteriorating when the <b>extra</b> <b>load</b> on the nodes reaches high levels. When the <b>extra</b> <b>load</b> reaches very high levels, the ACC stops functioning completely.

5000|$|This type of clutch is {{designed}} to partially disengage or [...] "slip" [...] when the rear wheel tries to drive the engine faster than it would run under its own power. The engine braking forces in conventional clutches will normally be transmitted back along the drive chain causing the rear wheel to hop, chatter or lose traction. This is especially noted on larger displacement four-stroke engines, which have greater engine braking than their two-stroke or smaller displacement counterparts. Slipper clutches eliminate this <b>extra</b> <b>loading</b> on the rear suspension giving riders a more predictable ride and {{minimize the risk of}} over-revving the engine during downshifts. Slipper clutches can also prevent a catastrophic rear wheel lockup in case of engine seizure. Generally, the amount of force needed to disengage the clutch is adjustable to suit the application.|$|E
5000|$|Midtown Walmart is a {{controversial}} proposal by Walmart {{to build a}} 203000 sq ft supercenter location on a 4.6 acre site in the planned sub-district of Midtown {{in the city of}} Miami, Florida, USA. The initial proposal did not meet local regulations and was rejected in February 2013, but was redesigned by Gensler and approved by the city commission in August 2013. It has faced public and political opposition from area residents, business owners, and community activists even as it has been adapted to meet strict zoning regulations that resulted in the design differing greatly from the typical layout, such as utilizing second story roof parking versus a surface lot and street liner retail instead of a blank wall perimeter. The original 2012 plan included 10500 sq ft of retail and about 550 parking spaces on two levels above the 184000 sq ft store. This more urban footprint is similar to what Walmart did to build a location in Santurce, (downtown) San Juan, Puerto Rico, known as [...] "Plaza 18", as well as Washington, D.C. where the city's first Walmart is a true mixed-use development, with third party retail as well as 300 apartments above the store. Purchased in January 2014 for US$8.2 million, the currently vacant site sits at the southern tip of Midtown between North Miami Avenue and Midtown Boulevard from Northeast 29th and 31st Streets, between the burgeoning neighborhoods of Wynwood and Edgewater. It would be the first traditional Walmart location within the actual City of Miami limits, although there are several locations just outside city limits in Doral, Hialeah, Gladeview, North Miami Beach, and Westchester, as well as a [...] "Neighborhood Market" [...] in the western fringes of the city. In January 2016, Fort Lauderdale opened its first Walmart. After {{more than a year of}} litigation, Walmart won a court battle in August 2015. Specifically the litigation targeted the proposed zoning variance for two <b>extra</b> <b>loading</b> berths and traffic congestion caused by the development. Ridership at the Northside Metrorail station increased significantly after the adjacent Gladeview location opened. Other criticism is due to the fabric of the neighborhood amid an urban revival that included small, locally owned businesses and warehouse renovation versus new construction. However, the Midtown development already contains a Target and a Ross.|$|E

Actuation energy and actuation time results are promising for morphing in level flight. Functional problems such as closing a structural gap in the wing’s leading edge are still to be solved before flight testing. Future work will include design of airfoil morphing mechanisms to be incorporated in the experimental morphing wing. I...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{with the}} performance of different loaded (e. g. inverted L, T, I and C-shaped antennas) and unloaded wire antennas as electromagnetic interference (EMI) sensors. To determine electromagnetic radiation from an electronic component, it is required to evaluate the field strength at a certain distance from it using the sensor. The most common performance descriptor of a sensor is its antenna factor. Here, the method of moments with pulse basis function and point-matching technique has been used to evaluate the current distribution on the antenna surface, and hence, the antenna factor of different wire antennas. The same theory for unloaded antennas has been extended for different loaded-wire antennas. The loaded antennas in transmitting mode are widely used for low-frequency communication. However, while using these antennas as EMI sensors, the <b>extra</b> <b>loading</b> is likely to introduce the reception of cross-polarised component of incident electric field. This paper highlights the results of the initial investigation on the performance of these loaded antennas as EMI sensors in terms of the antenna factor for the desired and cross-polarised component of incident electric field...|$|E

40|$|Long {{duration}} {{precise and}} stable tidal observations are recorded {{to detect the}} temporal variation of free core nutation (also called the fluid core resonance, FCR) parameters, so as to reveal geophysical and dynamical processes at the core mantle boundary (CMB) of the Earth. At Esashi Earth Tides Station of National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, the tidal admittance and the non-tidal signal are estimated from 17 years of records with three extensometer data. From the estimated admittances of diurnal tidal constituents, the FCR parameters are fitted. The obtained time series of FCR eigenperiod and quality factor show 10 - 11 years scale temporal variation. The range of the eigenperiod variation is several dozens sidereal days (s. d.). This phenomenon is validated and confirmed by the gravitational tidal observation of a co-located super-conducting gravimeter (SG) with the observation from 1992 to 2002. Overestimated atmospheric response, <b>extra</b> <b>loading</b> effects from the temporal variations of local rock properties and of ocean tidal constituents, {{as well as the}} flattening variation of the topography at CMB are suggested to be the possible mechanisms to cause the periodical variation of FCR parameters.

A total of 25 types of multi-layer cladding materials and 9 types of single-layer skin materials made in Taiwan along with 4 types of overseas multi-layer skin materials were tested using the hot box method (HBM). The above data were then adopted to calculate the heat-insulation ability, vapor transmission volume and heat gain cooling load. Besides, the costs of the above materials were also collected to provide useful information for green building industry to select the most proper skin materials in considering both the material performance and costs.
