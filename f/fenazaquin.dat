40|$|Spirodiclofen, an {{acaricide}} {{with a novel}} mode {{of action}} (inhibition of lipid synthesis), has recently been commercialized and recommended as a compound that effectively controls mite populations resistant to other acaricides. The efficacy of the spirodiclofen against European red mite [Panonychus ulmi (Koch) ] on apple, and two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch) on greenhouse cucumber was tested in Serbia from 2004 to 2008. Spirodiclofen efficacy was compared {{to the effectiveness of}} several other acaricides (bifenthrin, clofentezine, <b>fenazaquin,</b> fenpyroximate) that had been in use for some time. The acaricides were applied at their recommended application rates. Control efficacy against P. ulmi was tested in a commercial apple orchard at Morovic (45 ° 00. 711 ’N; 19 ° 15. 146 ’ E). Applied at the BBCH 09 growth stage (green leaf tips about 5 mm above bud scales) against overwintering eggs, spirodiclofen achieved 89. 1 and 86. 0 % efficacy in evaluations 12 and 25 DAT (days after treatment), respectively. Similar effectiveness was demonstrated for <b>fenazaquin</b> (91. 3 and 84. 4 %), while clofentezine achieved a considerably lower efficacy (67. 4 and 27. 8 %, respectively).

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of spirodiclofen, an acaricide and insecticide {{with a novel}} mode of action, in protecting apple from the European red mite (Panonychus ulmi) and pear from pear psylla (Cacopsylla pyri) was tested in field trials in four sites in Serbia in 2004, 2005 and 2007. The efficacy of P. ulmi control was investigated at Morović(Šid), where the effects of spirodiclofen were {{compared with those of}} <b>fenazaquin,</b> clofentezine, fenpyroximate and bifenthrin. Applied in 2004 at a rate of 0. 096 g a. i. L- 1 against the overwintering eggs ofP. ulmi, spirodiclofen achieved 86 % efficacy, while the efficacies of <b>fenazaquin</b> and clofentezine (25 days after treatment) were 84. 4 % and 27. 8 %, respectively. In the same season, spirodiclofen displayed high and prolonged efficacy against a summer population of P. ulmi: the efficacy of this acaricide applied at concentrations of 0. 096 and 0. 144 g a. i. L- 1 was 98 % and 96. 9 %, respectively, while fenpyroximate, clofentezine and bifenthrin achieved 43 %, 59. 5 % and 62 % efficacy, respectively (45 days after treatment). This effect of spirodiclofen against the summer population was confirmed in the same site in 2005, when 94. 9 - 95. 7 % efficacy was achieved (47 days after treatment). The efficacy of spirodiclofen, amitraz and abamectin against eggs and larvae of the first generation of C. pyri was examined at a Bela Crkva site in 2004, and in sites at Mandjelos (Sremska Mitrovica) and Bela Crkva in 2005. Applied at a concentration of 0. 144 g a. i. L- 1 at the beginning of hatching, spirodiclofen was found to achieve 83. 2 - 95 % efficacy, abamectin 93. 5 - 94. 9 % and amitraz 78. 9 - 95. 6 % efficacy (14 days after treatment). Applied in a site at Borkovac (Ruma) in 2007 at a rate of 0. 096 g a. i. L- 1 before hatching of the first generation larvae, spirodiclofen reduced the number of eggs and larvae of C. pyri by 72 %, 82 % and 89 % in evaluations 18, 25 and 38 days after treatment, while abamectin and diflubenzuron achieved reductions of 92 %, 95 % and 91 %, and 78 %, 71 % and 86 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Following the EPPO {{guidelines}} and Principles of Good Experimental Practice (GEP), an experiment was realised in autumn 2008 {{for evaluating the}} efficacy of Oberon applied by foliar treatments to contain infestations of mites and whiteflies on Capsicum annuum L [...] Two different dosages of OBERON (a. i. Spiromesifen) [...] 45 and 60 g/hl [...] were compared with a unique dosage of two commercial formulates: VERTIMEC (a. i. Abamectine, Syngenta Crop Protection), 60 g/hl, and MAGISTER (a. i. <b>Fenazaquin,</b> Dow AgroSciences), 110 g/hl. Oberon resulted very effective in the control of phytopathogenic mites at both doses of 45 and 60 g/hl. Its effectiveness demonstrated to be remarkable for approximately one month after application. By contrast, Vertimec and Magister have proven their effectiveness for a much lower period of time (about the first 15 days post application). About the efficacy against whiteflies, even 36 days after the foliar application Oberon showed a strong containment of the populations of aleurodides. There were no phenomena of phytotoxicity nor on leaves nor on flowers and fruits, in none of the treatments. About the phytotoxicity on the useful entomofauna, the assessments made on the different treatments have highlighted the lack of harmful effects on predators and on parasitoids of insects and mites...|$|E
40|$|A Belgian field strain (MR-VP) of Tetranychus urticae (Koch) (Acari: Tetranychidae) {{exhibits}} {{different levels}} of resistance to four frequently used METI (mitochondria) electron transport inhibitor) -acaricides, i. e. tebufenpyrad, fenpyroximate, pyridaben and <b>fenazaquin.</b> Resistance factors for these compounds were 184, 1547, 5971 and 35, respectively. A 23. 5 -fold increase in 7 -ethoxy- 4 -trifluoromethylcoumarin O-deethylation activity suggested that metabolic resistance through elevated levels of cytochrome P 450 dependent monooxygenase-activity is a possible resistance mechanism. However, synergism studies with different metabolic inhibitors revealed some contrasting resistance mechanisms between the METI-acaricides. Tebufenpyrad resistance could only be synergized after pre-treatment with the monooxygenase inhibitor piperonyl butoxide (PBO), whereas pyridaben resistance was strongly synergized both by PBO and the esterase inhibitor S,S,S-tributylphosphorotrithioate (DEF). Resistance levels to fenpyroximate could neither be suppressed by PBO nor by DEF. Although METI-acaricides are structurally related, these findings probably reflect a different role of esterases and monooxygenases in metabolic detoxification between these compounds. The overall lack of synergism by diethylmaleate (DEM) suggests that glutathione-S-transferases are not {{an important factor in}} resistance to METIs. Reciprocal crosses between susceptible females and resistant males showed no maternal effect, and resistance to METI-acaricides was inherited generally as a dominant trait. Backcrosses with F, females revealed striking differences in the mode of inheritance. Although resistance to fenpyroximate and pyridaben was under monogenic control, resistance to tebufenpyrad was under control of more than one gene...|$|E

Some extracts of vegetables, found positive for pesticides with GC, were subjected to Ames test and SOS Chromotest to evaluate the possible antimutagenic and/or antigenotoxic effects of vegetable matrices. The same bioassays were also performed on the mixtures of pesticides found in these samples to evaluate whether interactions could occur between pesticides and be responsible of the possible antimutagenic and/or antigenotoxic effects of the contaminated matrices. Experiments were also carried out to compare the results found for the contaminated vegetables to their contents in antioxidant components. Significant differences in mutagenicity and genotoxicity were found among the pesticides selected for this study. Of the twelve pesticides tested only Azinphos methyl, Cyprodinil, Fludioxonil and Iprodione {{were found to be}} positive both for S. typhimurium and for E. coli. No mutagenic/genotoxic activity was found in the extracts of vegetables contaminated by pesticides. The S. typhimurium TA 1535 showed a strong positive mutagenic effect for the mixtures of pesticides while they were not able to induce the SOS system. The data concerning the content in polyphenols and the total reducing activity of the contaminated vegetables indicated high amounts of antioxidants that could explain the inhibitory effect on the activity of pesticides shown by vegetables...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe paper reports {{findings}} {{concerning a}} five years study aimed to evaluate pesticides levels, deriving from orchards activities, on the Italian most common orange cultivar (Citrus Sinensis, L. Osbeck, cv. Tarocco). The study, using a Bayesian approach, allowed obtaining both the qualitative (the number) and quantitative distributions (the amount) of pesticides {{with its own}} probability value. Multi residues analyses of the 460 analysed samples highlighted the presence of: ethyl and methyl Chlorpyrifos, Dicofol, Etofenprox, <b>Fenazaquin,</b> Fenitrotion, Imazalil, Malathion and Metalaxil-m. The 30. 5 % of samples shown just one pesticide, the 2. 16 % two pesticides and the 0. 65 % of samples shown three pesticides at the same time. The most common residue was ethyl chlorpyrifos followed by methyl chlorpyrifos [...] The Estimated Daily Intake (EDI) values distributions for ethyl and methyl chlorpyrifos, {{as well as the}} distance from safety level (NOAEL), were calculated. The risk has been differentiate in order: 1) to keep in account also the period of real citrus consuming (180 days); 2) to differentiate the risk deriving from eating oranges that contain a certain level of chlorpyrifos from those unspecified. The most likely EDI values for ethyl chlorpyrifos, deriving from Italian blood oranges consumption are: 0. 01 and 0. 006 mg/day, calculated on 180 and 365 days, respectively. Considering the probalility of occurrence of ethyl chlorpyrifos, the EDI values are reduced up to: 2. 6 * 10 - 3 and 1. 3 * 10 - 3 mg/day, respectively. Analogously for methyl chlorpyrifos, the EDI most likely values are: 0. 09 and 0. 04 mg/day, respectively. Considering its probability of occurrence the EDI values are: 6. 7 * 10 - 3 and 3. 4 * 10 - 3 mg/day, respectively.
