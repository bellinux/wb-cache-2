25|$|We Will Rock You (often {{abbreviated}} as WWRY) is {{a musical}} {{based on the}} songs of British rock band Queen with a book by Ben Elton. The musical {{tells the story of}} a group of Bohemians who struggle to restore the free exchange of thought, fashion, and live music in a distant future where everyone dresses, thinks and acts the same. Musical instruments and composers are forbidden, and rock music <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> unknown.|$|E

In practice, the quorum requirement <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> ignored. A quorum is assumed to be present unless a quorum call, requested by a member, proves otherwise. Rarely do members ask for quorum calls to demonstrate the absence of a quorum; more often, they use the quorum call as a delaying tactic.|$|E

Edward sacrifices his ability to perform alchemy to retrieve Alphonse's body and soul. Hohenheim visits Trisha's grave where he dies with a smile. Several months later, Edward and Alphonse return home where they are reunited with Winry, though they both leave home two years later to explore the world. The epilogue finishes with a family photo of Alphonse, May, Edward, Winry, and Ed's and Winry's son and daughter.|$|E
25|$|Although this {{approach}} <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> unknown among language teachers today, elements of it have had long-lasting effects on language teaching, being {{the basis of}} many widely used English as a Second/Foreign Language textbooks {{as late as the}} 1980s and elements of it still appear in current texts. Many of the structural elements of {{this approach}} were called into question in the 1960s, causing modifications of this method that led to communicative language teaching. However, its emphasis on oral practice, grammar and sentence patterns still finds widespread support among language teachers and remains popular in countries where foreign language syllabuses are still heavily based on grammar.|$|E
25|$|The Three Book Dunciad has an {{extensive}} inversion of Virgil's Aeneid, {{but it also}} structures itself heavily around a Christological theme. To some degree, this imagery of unholy consecration had been present in Dryden's MacFlecknoe, but Pope's King of Dunces is much more menacing than Thomas Shadwell could ever have been in Dryden's poem. It is {{not a case of}} an unworthy man getting praised that spurs the poem, but rather a force of degradation and decadence that motivates it. Pope is not targeting one man, but rather a social decline that he feels <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> irrevocable. Nevertheless, the poem is still a satire and not a lamentation. The top of society (the kings) may be dulled by spectacle and freak shows, but Dulness is only one force. She is at war with the men of wit, and she can be opposed. In the Four Book Dunciad (or Dunciad B), any hope of redemption or reversal is gone, and the poem is even more nihilistic.|$|E

25|$|The Blob is {{vulnerable}} to attacks directed at his face, as his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears {{do not have the}} same protection as the rest of his body. Dukes is also susceptible to psionic attacks and psychic manipulation, and he can be incapacitated by sensory assaults; for example, Banshee was able to render Blob unconscious solely through the use of his sonic scream. On another occasion, Sleepwalker defeated the Blob by using warp beams to wrap a steel girder around the villain, crushing his blubber and causing him great physical pain. The Hulk once took the opposite approach, harming the Blob by grabbing and stretching his flab. While he <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> invulnerable to direct kinetic attacks, such as punches, kicks or gunshots, he is susceptible to concussions and other harm resulting from sufficiently powerful impacts, as Daredevil knocked him out by luring him underneath a massive bell and then having it dropped on him with the aid of a young female mutant.|$|E

As of , construction crews are repairing the road, which {{was scheduled to be}} open by 2014. However, the Forest Service has a limited budget, and the effort to rebuild the road has been criticized by environmental groups, partly because of the lower number of visitors, since access from the west has become almost impossible. Since Image Lake <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> inaccessible from the west, it is necessary for hikers to access the lake from the east, via a two-day hike from Holden or Trinity.|$|E

500|$|Many sociologists {{have assumed}} that a given type of leisure {{activity}} is most easily explained by socioeconomic variables such as income, occupation or education. This has yielded fewer results than expected; income is associated with total money spent on such activities, but otherwise only determines what type of activities are affordable. Occupation has a similar effect, because most occupations heavily influence a person's income (for example, membership in a prestigious occupation and [...] "country-club" [...] activities such as golf or sailing are significantly correlated—but so is membership in those occupations and high income, and those activities with high cost). Education is correlated with having {{a wide range of}} leisure activities, and with higher dedication to them. As Kelly noted, [...] "Predicting a person's leisure behavior {{on the basis of his}} socioeconomic position <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> impossible." ...|$|E
500|$|The spores are broadly , amyloid (meaning {{they will}} adsorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent), and measure 7–10 by 4–6μm. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) are usually four-spored, {{although}} two- and three-spored forms {{have been found}} on which the spores measure 11–14 by 6–6.5μm or 8–10 by 3.5–4.5μm, respectively. The pleurocystidia (cystidia {{on the face of}} a gill) are scattered, rare or absent, 30–44 by 9–13μm, variable in shape, - to club-shaped, with some having a forked apex. The pleurocystidia that are club-shaped occasionally have two or three finger-like prolongations. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are numerous, and similar in morphology to the pleurocystidia. The flesh of the gill is , composed of enlarged hyphae that stain vinaceous-brown in iodine. The flesh of the cap has a well-differentiated , the cells of which bear numerous rodlike prolongations. The hypoderm (a layer of tissue immediately below the pellicle) is well-formed, while the remaining tissue <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>but</b> the pellicle are vinaceous-brown in iodine stain.|$|E
