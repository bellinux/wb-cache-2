Before she can escape, though, Tigerstar comes and attacks the duo of animals, telling her to run. Scrambling up a tree, Sasha sees that the foxes have an advantage over him, and she jumps down to assist him. After defeating both foxes, Tigerstar stays in her den for the night and lets his wounds heal, and tells Sasha that he came to thank her for the pigeon, and that she is unlike any housecat he <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known.</b>|$|E

25|$|The two central {{characters}} are the Americans Bremen and Gail. Both are telepaths, {{the only other}} telepaths that either <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known.</b> Inevitably, they fall in love. When Gail dies of illness, Bremen is devastated. He gives up his career in mathematics and becomes a drifter. At the commencement of the action, he has ended up at a facility for retarded and otherwise disabled minors. He becomes sort of fond of one named Robby, who had been blinded and mentally crippled before birth by his mother's drug abuse habits, and resolves that before he leaves the facility (for he feels he has been there too long), he will use his telepathic power to give Robby a gift of sorts: images and sounds of the outside world.|$|E
25|$|Working through {{abandonment}} {{depression is}} a complicated, lengthy and conflicted {{process that can}} be an enormously painful experience {{in terms of what}} is remembered and what must be felt. It involves mourning and grieving for the loss of the illusion that the patient had adequate support for the emergence of the real self. There is also a mourning for the loss of an identity, the false self, which the person constructed and with which he or she has negotiated much of his or her life. The dismantling of the false self requires relinquishing the only way that the patient <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known</b> of how to interact with others. This interaction was better than not to have a stable, organized experience of the self, no matter how false, defensive, or destructive that identity may be.|$|E
500|$|When {{the news}} of the {{imminent}} death sentence arrives, Zeenat is compelled to tell the truth to Meera. Meera is shocked beyond belief to hear Zeenat's words. The fact that her friendship was based on false pretenses is what hurts her more. She immediately refuses to sign the maafinama (statement of forgiveness). She makes it clear that she wants to hurt her husband's murderer, even if it was an accident, because of how much she is hurting in her new, veiled life. She leaves for the haveli. Zeenat, initially, is deeply hurt from Meera's decision but eventually accepts it as fate and decides to leave for her hometown. Meera later has a change of heart, perhaps because of her disillusionment at Randhir's willingness to [...] "sell" [...] her to Chopra. She gets encouragement from her paternal grandmother and hurries towards the railway station, where she meets Zeenat and gives her the signed statement of forgiveness. Zeenat extends her hand from the train and Meera grabs it and climbs aboard, presumably running away from the only life she <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>known,</b> as the train speeds up into the distance.|$|E
