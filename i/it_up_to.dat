5|$|The {{appearance}} of new Soviet tanks {{such as the}} T-80B during the late 1970s and early 1980s demanded {{the development of new}} technologies and weapons to counter the threat posed to Western armor. The T-80B had increased firepower and a new composite ceramic armor. The T-72 also went through a modernization program in an attempt to bring <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the standards of the T-80B. In 1985 the new T-72B version entered production, with a new laminate armor protection system; its turret armor, designed primarily to defeat anti-tank missiles, surpassed the T-80B's in protection.|$|E

No evidence of significant buildings within the fort has been found by excavators. A number of Roman hearths are situated at regular intervals in the centre of the fort's interior, suggesting that they may have been the site of wooden barrack blocks. The buildings are conjectured to have been largely timber-framed wattle and daub structures which have left little trace.|$|E

5000|$|The 2008 fall in {{the value}} of {{sterling}} against the euro saw the price gap between North and South widen and shoppers cross to Northern Ireland to the detriment of businesses in the South. Coughlan asked multiple retailers to reduce their margins south of the border and provide better value to consumers in the South. Research from Forfás, concluded that only a five per cent difference in the cost of goods between North and South was justifiable. The findings highlighted retailers' larger margins in the South in relation to their operations in the North and Coughlan queried why the price differential in many identical goods was substantially in excess of 5%. Coughlan said: [...] "I don't own a shop. The Government doesn't own a shop. <b>It's</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Tesco, <b>it's</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Superquinn, <b>it's</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Aldi, <b>it's</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Lidl; <b>it's</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> them to cut their prices. They need to ensure that that happens; they {{have to do something about}} it." [...] When retailers continued to remain silent on the price differential, Coughlan sent in the Competition Authority to investigate supply chains in the retail sector.|$|R
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 18th century, Cuba Court was {{the home}} of Denis Bowes Daly, who was a {{prominent}} member of the local ascendancy. Prior to his death in 1821 he had leased Cuba Court to the Army Medical Board on a 61-year lease. The building was little used as a hospital and the Medical Board was quite happy to give <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Commissioners of Education for the purpose of the Royal School, which had eventually been established {{as a result of the}} Royal Charter of 1621.|$|E
5|$|After Bullecourt, the 4th Brigade withdrew to Ribemont, where {{reinforcements}} brought <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> strength. During this period, Murray oversaw musketry training {{before being}} granted convalescent leave to London in May. While in the capital, he {{was decorated with}} his Victoria Cross and Distinguished Service Order by King George V in Hyde Park on 2 June 1917. Promoted major on 12 July, he rejoined his battalion later in the month, and during the 4th Brigade's advance to the Hindenburg Line over subsequent months, was involved in actions at Messines, Ploegstreert Wood, Menin Road, Polygon Wood, Broodseinde, Poelcappelle and Passchendaele. For his actions at Passchendaele, Murray garnered a mention in Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig's dispatch of 7 November 1917.|$|E
5|$|After this, the Allied forces {{advanced}} to the fortified naval outpost of Tobruk. The 6th Division attacked the perimeter defences early on 21 January, following a week of continuous bombardment from both land and sea. The 2/3rd Battalion was tasked with breaching the outer Italian defences for the 2/1st Battalion to pass through. Following the initial breakthrough, the 2/3rd then advanced west along the inner ring of defences, attacking a number of Italian posts as they went. Tobruk fell the next day, with the Italians surrendering to Brigadier Horace Robertson, {{the commander of the}} 19th Brigade. The Italian flag was taken down {{and in the absence of}} an Australian flag, a signaler from the 2/4th Battalion tied his slouch hat to the flag staff and hauled <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the top. The battalion's losses during the fighting for Tobruk were seven officers and 50 men killed or wounded.|$|E

The IX Corps fought in the Overland Campaign of May 1864 as an independent command, reporting initially to Grant; his corps was not assigned to the Army of the Potomac because Burnside outranked its commander Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, {{who had been a}} division commander under Burnside at Fredericksburg. This cumbersome arrangement was rectified on May 24 just before the Battle of North Anna, when Burnside agreed to waive his precedence of rank and was placed under Meade's direct command.|$|E
5|$|By May 2009 LCR {{had become}} {{insolvent}} {{and the government}} received agreement to use state aid to purchase the line and also to open <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> competition to allow other services to use it apart from Eurostar. LCR's hitherto wholly owned subsidiary, HS1 Ltd, thus became {{the property of the}} Secretary of State for Transport. On 12 October 2009 a proposal was announced to sell £16billion of state assets including HS1 Ltd in the following two years to cut UK public debt. The government announced on 5 November 2010 that a concession to operate the line for 30years had been sold for £2.1billion to a consortium of Canadian investors. Under the concession, HS1Ltd has the rights to sell access to track and to the four international stations (St Pancras, Stratford, Ebbsfleet and Ashford) on a commercial basis, under the scrutiny of the Office of Rail Regulation. At the end of 30years, ownership of the assets will revert to government.|$|E
5|$|During {{a routine}} liposuction {{operation}} in Winnetka, Illinois, Dr. Harrison Lloyd (John Juliani) suddenly begins to remove so much fat {{from a patient}} that the patient dies. Following the unusual experience, Lloyd tells Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) that he killed the patient because he was possessed. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is skeptical about Lloyd's claims, believing he's only making <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> escape legal consequences. Mulder inspects the operation room and discovers a pentagram burned into the floor; he begins to suspect that witchcraft might have {{played a part in}} the crime. Meanwhile, the staff at Lloyd's clinic are shocked when another plastic surgeon, Dr. Ilaqua (Paul Raskin), murders an elderly patient by burning a hole through her cheek and neck with a surgical laser, severing her brain stem. Scully interviews Ilaqua, who claims that he cannot remember anything of the incident. Mulder's suspicions are strengthened when he reviews the tape of the second murder, and he sees a pentagram-like pattern on the stomach of the victim.|$|E

5|$|Following the accident, Johnson {{suggested}} {{launching the}} D-21 {{from the very}} large Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber, and adding a solid rocket booster to get <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> speed. The drone was modified by adding attachment points on its spine to mate with the carrying pylon on the B-52 and its belly attachment points were adapted to accommodate the rocket booster necessary to increase its speed and allow its ramjet to operate. Its vertical stabilizer was increased in size by approximately 20%. The modified drone version was designated D-21B (there was no D-21A). Two B-52Hs were modified to carry a pair of drones each by means of two large underwing pylons that replaced the smaller pylons used for the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missiles. The tail gunner's and electronic warfare officer's stations were replaced with two launch control stations. Command and telemetry systems were added, and high-speed cameras were installed to track the drones as they separated from the pylons. The launch control officer on the B-52H could communicate with the D-21Bs, and could make it self-destruct.|$|E

He agreed to this, and in 1943 The Crab with the Golden Claws was re-edited and coloured for publication as an album in 1944. Due to the changes in how the adventure had been serialised at , the album at this juncture was only 58 pages long, and thus Hergé filled the missing pages with four full-page colour frames, thus bringing <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the standard 62-page format.|$|E

5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 3 was realigned {{to follow the}} entire length of the Route S3 freeway.

Only the section west of Paterson Plank Road was state-maintained after the renumbering, and the entire route was eliminated by the 1990s. In the mid-1950s, Route 3 was planned as one of the original routes of the Interstate Highway System; however, the New Jersey State Highway Department had deemed it too expensive to bring <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Interstate Highway standards and Interstate 280 was favored instead.
