5|$|After landfall, the cyclone {{accelerated}} in {{forward speed}} northward, weakening in intensity, and, by 1200UTC on October 12, Marco became an extra-tropical cyclone. It {{turned to the}} northeast and east through South Carolina, following behind Hurricane Lili to its northeast. For a time, the system's proximity to Lili resulted in hints of the Fujiwhara effect, in which two tropical cyclone appear to rotate around each other. The cold front that absorbed the weakening low was to the storm's north on October 13, though moisture from the remnants of Marco dropped heavy rainfall across the southeast United States <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fausto {{steadily}} weakened {{throughout the}} following two days as it moved over progressively cooler waters. By July21, the storm was downgraded to a tropical storm and a tropical depression the next day. Early on July23, the depression lacked deep convection and degenerated into a remnant low pressure area. The low persisted <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>day</b> before dissipating over open waters. Hurricane Fausto {{had little effect on}} land, despite passing close to the islands of Clarion and Socorro where high winds, reaching hurricane-force on Socorro, were recorded. Moderate rainfall from the outer bands of the storm amounted to 1.9in (50mm) in the Mexican state of Sinaloa.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Artemisium, the Allies {{saw that}} they would {{probably}} {{not be able to}} hold the line <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>day,</b> such were their losses. They thus debated whether they should withdraw from Artemisium, whilst they awaited news from Thermopylae. Themistocles ordered the men to slaughter and barbecue the flocks of the Euboeans, so that they would not fall into Persian hands. Abronichus arrived on the liaison ship from Thermopylae and told the Allies of the destruction of the Allied rearguard at Thermopylae. Since holding the Straits of Artemisium now no longer held any strategic purpose, and given their losses, the Allies decided to evacuate immediately.|$|E

5|$|Due to the storm's {{proximity}} to Typhoon Joan, forecast models anticipated Ivan to re-curve {{before reaching the}} Philippines; however, the storm maintained its track and {{did not take the}} northward turn until impacting the country. The typhoon began to slow and weaken, and on October20, its center made landfall in extreme northern Luzon with winds of 220km/h (140mph). After emerging into the Luzon Strait, Ivan turned to the north-northeast and weakened to a tropical storm. On October22, the storm briefly re-attained typhoon status before accelerating in forward speed. The system steadily weakened and the JTWC issued their final advisory on the storm on October24. The JMA continued to monitor Ivan as a tropical cyclone <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>day</b> before classifying it as extratropical. The remnants of the powerful typhoon eventually dissipated on October26.|$|E
5|$|On September30, a {{well-developed}} tropical wave {{moved off}} the eastern coast of Africa {{and entered the}} Atlantic Ocean. Deep convection formed around a prominent mid-level circulation as it moved towards the west. However, the convection diminished on October2 before entering the Caribbean Sea a week later. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea, shower and thunderstorm activity redeveloped around the low. Continued development followed and the low was designated as Tropical Depression Fifteen at 0600UTC on October13 while located about 190miles (305kilometres) south of the southeastern tip of the Dominican Republic. The previous steady westward motion that the system took across the Atlantic halted as it entered an area of weak steering currents and significant motion was not expected <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>day</b> or two. As {{the structure of the}} storm improved, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) gave it the name Omar.|$|E
5|$|Throughout August22, Danny's {{structure}} deteriorated {{with its}} surface and mid-level circulations becoming tilted with height {{due to the}} shear. The surface low soon became exposed with convection displaced to the northeast, and Danny weakened to a tropical storm by 00:00UTC on August23. The storm briefly leveled off in intensity somewhat later that day, with its circulation back under convection; intense lightning was observed near the cyclone's center. Late on August23, Danny's structure began degrading once more with its circulation becoming significantly displaced from the remaining ragged convection. Early on August24, Hurricane Hunters struggled to find a circulation center as Danny neared the Lesser Antilles, and the system weakened to a tropical depression by 12:00UTC as it passed between Guadeloupe and Dominica. Hours later it degenerated into a tropical wave, marking its dissipation as a tropical cyclone. The remnants of Danny continued to the west-northwest <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>day</b> and were last noted over Hispaniola.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Blanca was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone during the 2009 Pacific hurricane season. Forming {{out of a}} trough of low pressure on July6, Blanca was immediately classified a tropical storm roughly 420mi (675km) south-southwest of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. Later that day, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) and a barometric pressure of 998mbar (hPa; 29.47inHg) as deep convection persisted around the center of circulation. Shortly after, the system began to weaken. Intermittent bursts of convection occurred on July7 before Blanca weakened to a tropical depression. The following day, the system degenerated into a remnant low pressure system, devoid of shower and thunderstorms. The remnants were monitored by the National Hurricane Center <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>day.</b> Although the storm did not impact land as a tropical cyclone, its remnants produced unseasonable rains in southern California and moisture from the system contributed to flooding in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Early on September19, the JMA {{upgraded}} Yagi to a typhoon. After {{completing the}} loop, Yagi's track {{was influenced by}} a subtropical ridge located to the southeast of Japan. The typhoon continued to intensify and reached its peak intensity on September21 with winds of 195km/h (120mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 910hPa (mbar), making it the strongest storm of the season according to the JMA. At the same time, the JTWC classified Yagi as a Category 5 super typhoon with winds of 260km/h (160mph 1-minute winds). On September22, Yagi passed by the islands of Iwo Jima and Chichijima as the storm recurved towards the northeast. With increasing wind shear, the typhoon began to weaken and also began to undergo an extratropical transition. Late on September24, the JTWC classified the storm as an extratropical cyclone and issued their final advisory. The JMA kept Yagi as a tropical system <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>day</b> as it weakened to a severe tropical storm. Early on September25, they classified it as extratropical. The remnants of Yagi continued towards the northeast and crossed the International Date Line on September27. The storm was last noted near the Aleutian Islands.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kiko {{was one of}} {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclones to have hit the eastern coast of Mexico's Baja California peninsula during recorded history. The eleventh named storm of the 1989 Pacific hurricane season, Kiko formed out of a large mesoscale convective system on August25. Slowly tracking northwestward, the storm rapidly intensified into a hurricane early the next day. Strengthening continued until early August27, when Kiko reached its peak intensity with winds of 120mph (195km/h). The storm turned west at this time, and at around 0600UTC, the storm made landfall near Punta Arena at the southern tip of Baja California Sur. The hurricane rapidly weakened into a tropical storm later that day and further into a tropical depression by August28, shortly after entering the Pacific Ocean. The depression persisted <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>day</b> while tracking southward, before being absorbed by nearby Tropical Storm Lorena. Though Kiko made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane, its impact was relatively minor. Press reports indicated that 20 homes were destroyed and numerous highways were flooded by torrential rains.|$|E

5|$|On January 12, RSMC Nadi {{reported}} that a tropical depression had developed over the Fijian island of Vanua Levu, about 430 km (270 mi) {{to the south of}} Labasa. Over the next few days, the depression moved towards the southeast before it started to affect Tonga on January 15. During the following day, the depression rapidly developed further as it interacted with the South Pacific Convergence Zone, before the NPMOC initiated warnings on the system and designated it as 08P. At 0000 UTC on January 17, the NPMOC {{reported that}} the depression had reached its peak 1-minute sustained windspeeds of 85 km/h (50 mph) while RSMC Nadi reported that the depression had intensified into a tropical cyclone while it was located about 510 km (320 mi) to the southeast of Nukualofa, Tonga. However RSMC Nadi did not name it Yasi for another 12 hours, while the system reached its peak 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 85 km/h (50 mph). After it was named on January 17, Yasi accelerated towards the southeast, before it moved out of RSMC Nadi's area of responsibility. During January 18, the NPMOC issued their final warning because Yasi had degenerated into an extratropical cyclone. TCWC Wellington monitored Yasi's remnants <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>day,</b> before they dissipated about 1520 km (940 mi) to the south of Papette, French Polynesia. Although no major damage was reported from any of the islands affected some minor damage was reported in Tonga, after Yasi caused heavy rainfall there.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Bonnie was a weak but {{persistent}} {{tropical cyclone}} that brought heavy rains to the Southeastern United States in May2016. The second storm of the season, Bonnie formed {{from an area}} of low pressure northeast of the Bahamas on May27, {{a few days before the}} official hurricane season began on June1. Moving steadily west-northwestwards, Bonnie intensified into a tropical storm on May28 and attained peak winds six hours later. However, due to hostile environmental conditions, Bonnie weakened to a depression hours before making landfall just east of Charleston, South Carolina, on May29. Steering currents collapsed afterwards, causing the storm to meander over South Carolina for two days. The storm weakened further into a post-tropical cyclone on May31, before emerging off the coast while moving generally east-northeastwards. On June2, Bonnie regenerated into a tropical depression just offshore North Carolina as conditions became slightly more favorable. The next day, despite increasing wind shear and cooling sea surface temperatures, Bonnie reintensified into a tropical storm and reached its peak intensity. The storm hung on to tropical storm strength <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>day,</b> before weakening into a depression late on June4 and became post-tropical early the next day.|$|E

5|$|Willaumez's ships {{captured}} {{a number of}} stragglers from Redmill's convoy and managed to isolate Sirius, which only just escaped after narrowly avoiding an unequal encounter with four French ships of the line. With the convoy dispersed, Willaumez gathered his scattered forces and despatched the frigate Volontaire to the Spanish island of Tenerife with the prizes, before turning {{the remainder of his}} squadron southwards for his designated cruising grounds. To the north, Leissègues gradually approached Brisbane's convoy during the night but did not close with him until the morning of 16 December. In response, Brisbane formed his three warships into a line of battle, accompanied by three of the larger merchant ships. This force could not hope to resist Leissègues' main force, but would enable the 17 other vessels to escape by blocking the French squadron's frigates from chasing them. Ignoring the escaping convoy, Leissègues formed his own line of battle and continued to close with Brisbane, whose faster ships steadily pulled away from the French throughout the day. As darkness fell, Leissègues abandoned the pursuit and turned to the south and Brisbane immediately despatched Boadicea to Brest and Wasp to the blockade squadrons along the Atlantic Seaboard with urgent warnings of the French operations in the Eastern Atlantic. Brisbane himself remained in distant contact with Leissègues <b>for</b> <b>another</b> <b>day</b> before the French squadron sheered away. Brisbane continued southwards with the remainder of his convoy, seeking the British blockade squadron at Cadiz.|$|E
