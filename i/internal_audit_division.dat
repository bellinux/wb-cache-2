The <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> {{function}} (IAF) is a key component in an organisation’s corporate governance system. Despite {{the importance of the}} IAF to organisations, little is known about IAF quality beyond the viewpoint of the external auditor or beyond the IAF’s role of assuring financial reporting. The objective of this thesis is to better understand what is IAF quality by considering the experiences of other corporate governance stakeholders. To improve our understanding of IAF quality, this thesis conducts 36 semi-structured interviews with experienced participants from very large Australian firms, including audit committee members and chairs, senior management, heads of in-house IAFs, and partners of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>divisions</b> from the major accounting firms. These interviews are used to examine how IAF stakeholders judge IAF quality, determine if different IAF stakeholders judge IAF quality differently, and understand the important factors IAF stakeholders consider as determinants of a quality IAF.

This study provides empirical evidence as to the main factors influencing <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> independence. <b>Internal</b> <b>audit</b> effectiveness can be only enhanced through its independence; there are various factors that contribute to autonomy of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> in public sector organizations. These factors are namely competence of <b>internal</b> <b>audit,</b> the size of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> department, the relationship between internal and external auditors, management support for <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> and the independence of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> department. The results suggested that management should support the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> function and promote <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> autonomy from political interference. This would bring effectiveness of both the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> function and management. In this context, literature was also reviewed whereby different views were given towards autonym of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> in public sector. <b>Internal</b> <b>audit</b> was defined, forms of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> that <b>internal</b> auditors comply with such as Financial audit, Risk management and system controls, Advisory and investigative service and Performance audit.

The sample population is 50 and it constitutes 25 from the general lower level employees, 7 from the top management, 10 from councillors, 4 from <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> employees and 4 from the workers committee. The research tools used were interviews and questionnaires which had both open-ended and closed questions. Sampling techniques used are purposive, stratified and simple random sampling.

40|$|In recent years, {{the need}} to develop {{professional}} competence in <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> has increasingly come under the spotlight. The main reasons for this are a growing need for competent internal auditors who can render value-adding services to a variety of stakeholders, and the need for an effective <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> function, where <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> competence and professionalism are regarded as determinants of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> effectiveness. Prior research has focused on <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> education at a tertiary level, so research on workplace learning for <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> auditors is limited. The IIA Research Foundation undertook a series of Common Body of Knowledge studies, and developed an <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> competency framework indicating competency requirements for various levels of internal auditors. However, no reference is made to <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> trainees or new internal auditors, or to the learning paths required to achieve the set competencies.

The literature review discussed the evolution of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> profession {{and its impact on the}} competency requirements of internal auditors. The dimensions of workplace learning were explored. In addition, workplace learning in the accounting and auditing professions was examined globally, and in South Africa, with reference to different professional bodies competency frameworks, and the workplace learning component of these frameworks. Data were collected from focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews held in South Africa with 65 participants, including <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> employers, <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> trainees, presenters and assessors of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> workplace learning, and members of the IIA (SA) Education and Training Committee to determine their views on <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> workplace learning. Based on the findings, the study proposes a workplace learning framework for developing <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> trainees into entry-level <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> professionals involving five dimensions: workplace learning criteria, workplace learning content, workplace learning methods, determinants of workplace learning success and challenges to workplace learning. It is recommended that <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> stakeholders take cognisance of these dimensions when embarking on workplace learning to ensure that all constituencies benefit from entry-level <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> professionals acquisition of professional competence.

Firstly, it aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of factors that could affect <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> standing, based on the references to <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> in the King report on governance for South Africa 2009 (King III). Secondly, questionnaire data collected from relevant stakeholders were aligned with {{the review of the}} <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> function standing obtained from King III in a comparative analysis of the standing of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> functions of national government departments. The main finding of this article is that <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> in government departments lacks the standing that is envisaged in King III. Regular communication between chairpersons of audit committees (CACs), accounting officers (AOs) and the heads of <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> (CAEs) of each department should clarify the role that <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> functions are expected to fulfil using the resources available. The agreed role should be reflected in the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> charter of each department. The National Treasury should play a prominent role in evaluating the reasonable nature of and compliance with government departments’ <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> charters. am 201...|$|R
