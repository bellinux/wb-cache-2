50|$|Hydraulic Fracturing {{operations}} generate site {{sound as}} well as vehicle sound and several different provisions are required to control it. Federal law regulates the levels of certain site machinery. A subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control</b> or a objective <b>immission</b> <b>control</b> {{can be applied to}} surrounding neighborhoods. See maximum Permissible Sound Levels. Motor vehicle sound is mostly off-site so vehicle noise regulations are applicable. See Motor Vehicles on a Public Right-of-way.The State of New York has announced a statewide ban on such operations.

California (Section 654.05), Portland OR (Section 18.10.040), and Seattle, WA (Section 25.08.485) require immission {{measurements to be made}} at the shoreline. Many states require emission measurements to be made at 50 feet.|$|R

Motor vehicles are moving sources so {{it is not possible to}} define any specific listeners so emission controls are appropriate. There are exceptions to this distinction. Construction equipment, and some recreation vehicles, move within a bounded area and can be considered to be time varying fixed sources. Standing motor vehicles can radiate sufficient sound to create noise disturbance. These must be treated by specific provisions.|$|R
25|$|A federal {{environmental}} programme {{was established in}} 1971, and in 1972 laws were passed to regulate garbage elimination and air pollution via emission. Matching grants covering 90% of infrastructure development were allocated to local communities, {{which led to a}} dramatic {{increase in the number of}} public swimming pools and other facilities of consumptive infrastructure throughout West Germany. The federal crime-fighting apparatus was also modernised, while a Foreign Tax Act was passed which limited the possibility of tax evasion. In addition, efforts were made to improve the railways and motorways. In 1971, a law was passed setting the maximum lead content at 0.4 grams per liter of gasoline, and in 1972 DDT was banned. The Federal <b>Immissions</b> <b>Control</b> Law, passed in March 1974, provided protection from noxious gases, noise, and air-borne particulate matter.|$|R
50|$|This {{provision}} is a subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control</b> with a curfew. Boston, MA (Section 16-2.2) prohibits street sales near schools or churches {{if there is}} a “disturbance of the peace”. Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.4) places a curfew between 6 pm and 9 am.|$|E
50|$|This {{provision}} is a subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control.</b> It {{is based on}} the noise disturbance from drag racing and tire squealing on public rights-of-way. Illinois (625 ILCS 5/11-505) prohibits such activities. Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.14) prohibits such activity if it creates a noise disturbance.|$|E
5000|$|... {{there are}} three levels of {{regulation}} for stationary sound sources. The most basic is the general one associated with noise disturbance. (See Noise Disturbance below.) It is a very broad subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control</b> that has evolved from earlier disturbance of the peace provisions. Subjectivity can lead to arbitrary enforcement. The next level of regulation is less broad; it is an objective <b>immission</b> <b>control</b> that uses specific levels of sound {{considered to be a}} noise disturbance. Arbitrary enforcement is reduced. (See Maximum Permissible Sound Levels below.) In both cases, however, the person creating the sound may not be aware that his actions are in violation. The concept that a potential violator should have fair warning that his actions are in violation has led to provisions that address specific noise problems. The sections below list those that are found in community noise ordinances.|$|E
40|$|Sorbent based {{methods have}} been {{successfully}} used {{in the collection of}} air samples to determine air quality. The complexity of the occurrence in air samples of several compounds in terms of composition (polar to non-polar compounds, very volatile to semi-volatile compounds) and abundance (below detection limit to over detector saturation limit) are topics that have {{to be taken into account}} when analytical methods are developed, especially in terms of sorbent choosing. An important amount of compounds found in air (eg. volatile organic compounds (VOC), volatile sulphur compounds (VSC) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)) generate odour problems, have associated R-phrases, are ozone precursors or have been declared carcinogens. The knowledge of their concentrations is very important to define air quality, not only in terms of odour nuisance but also in terms of toxicity. Therefore, emission and <b>immission</b> <b>controls</b> are important in air quality determination, both outdoors and indoors. Activated charcoal, Tenax TA, XAD- 2, Carbotrap, Carbopack, Carbosieve and Carboxen 569 are found among the different types of sorbents available. They have variable selectivity towards the different types of compounds present in air. Hence, a good combination of different sorbents may allow the determination of a wide range of compounds in air samples. The idoneity, the hydrophobicity and the mesh size of the adsorbent particles together with the air flow, the air volume sampled, the ambient temperature and humidity would determine the adsorption efficiency of a compound. Several techniques are available for desorbing the compounds adsorbed, being the most relevant the ones based on thermal desorption and solvent extractions. When developing an analytical methodology, several quality criteria have to be taken into account focusing in the selectivity, sensitivity, linearity, precision, breakthrough and accuracy of the method. Comparatives between different types of sorbents (Tenax TA, self-made multi-bed tubes (Carbotrap, Carbopack X and Carboxen- 569) and Radiello) arè done to determine the most reliable sorbent for the determination of concrete compounds present both in urban, rural and indoor air.

40|$|The {{ban on the}} use of {{chlorofluorocarbons}} (CFC's), {{the amendment}} of the second ordinance of the federal <b>immissions</b> <b>control</b> act and as well the general public's concern about the dangers of halogenated hydrocarbon solvents has initiated an intensive search for substitutes suitable for all use categories. The substitutes are mainly hydrocarbon solvents (HCS) which are defined as aliphatic (n- and iso-paraffins) and cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons with a chainlength between 9 and 13, a boiling range of 180 to 220 C and a flashpoint above 55 C. These substances are hazardous not only because of their inflammability but also because of the poor knowledge about their longterm toxicologic properties. For these reasons a hearing on the health related assessment has been conducted by the Federal Institute for Health Protection of Consumers and Veterinary Medicine (BgVV) and the Federal Environmental Agency (UBA). Estimates are that the total production and marketing of HCS ranges between 260 - 450 000 t/a. However, there is no information concerning the amount of HCS used in the different use categories. HCS' generated vapours can lead to explosive mixtures with air. Safety margins are poorly comparable {{because of the lack of}} standardized techniques to determine this physicochemical property. The toxicological relevance of additives like cleaning enhancers, stabilizers, viscosity adjusters and anticorrosives is not clear. The main route of emissions for HCS is the air. The knowledge about the ecotoxicological relevance is poor as well. The need for further research activities is deducted. Concerning the human exposure, a satisfactory amount of measurements are available only for the workplace in dry cleaning facilities. The burden in the housing area is much lower (values are given here up to 100 #mu#g/m" 3 [90 %]). The acute toxicity via the oral, inhalative or dermal pathway seems to be low. For rats, there is evidence for isoparaffins to have nephrotoxic as well as neurotoxic effects. Further studies on the longterm toxicology or on the carcinogenicity of the HCS were not reported. Gentoxic effects could not be deducted, although there is concern for the tumor promoting activity of HCS. Lamp oils are clearly hazardous for children. Epidemiological investigations on the longterm effect of HCS were not presented. (orig.)

50|$|This {{provision}} can {{be either}} a subjective or objective <b>immission</b> <b>control</b> with a curfew. The subjective aspect relates to noise disturbance in the local community. The objective aspect limits the acceptable sound level in the local community. Illinois (Environmental Protection Act 415.25) exempts certain stadiums and exempts festivals, parades, or street fairs. Colorado Spring, CO (Section 9.8.101) has similar exemptions, but limits the sound levels to 80 dB(A) at residential locations.|$|E
50|$|This {{provision}} is a subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control</b> with a curfew. Operations in commercial facilities can impact adjacent residential zones. Los Angeles, CA (Section 114.03) places a curfew on such operations between 10pm and 7am {{but only if}} the source is within 200 feet of a residence. Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2830) permits night operations unless they create a noise disturbance. Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.6) prohibits noise disturbance between 7pm and 7am.|$|E
50|$|This {{provision}} is a subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control.</b> An {{evaluation of the}} noise disturbance is made at the listener without a sound level meter. This {{provision is}} mostly applied in residential zones such as homes, apartments and condominiums. Albuquerque, NM (Article 9-9) requires that such units the maximum permissible sound levels (Se section below) and recommend that those units be placed away from other residential units or on roof tops to diminish impact.|$|E
50|$|This {{provision}} is a subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control.</b> It {{is used to}} reduce levels of both stationary and vehicular sound sources around hospitals, schools, and other noise sensitive locations. To provide fair warning visible signs must be posted. It is possible to have an extensive list. For example, if churches are on the list and the community has many of them, signage, compliance, and enforcement can be a problem. In modern hospital environments, helicopter sound is exempt.|$|E
50|$|This {{provision}} is a subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control.</b> This {{provision is}} generic {{in that it}} covers all events that are considered disturbing by a listener, with or without measurement. The strength of this provision is that it covers situations not contemplated in a noise ordinance {{and can be used}} as backup for more specific provisions. The weakness is that it may not give fair warning, may lead to arbitrary enforcement {{on the part of the}} regulator, or permit unreasonable demands by a listener.|$|E
5000|$|This {{provision}} is a subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control</b> with a curfew. It is for impulsive sound sources {{that are not}} associated with construction activities or shooting ranges. Many communities use the Maximum Permissible Sound Levels criterion (see below), with a correction for {{the character of the}} sound. Illinois (...) sets maximum blasting levels by land use zone and in three time categories. Portland, OR (Section 18.10.010.F) limits levels to 100 dB (peak) from 7am to 10pm and 80 dB (peak) from 10pm to 7 am.|$|E
50|$|This {{provision}} is a subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control.</b> Most relate to barking dogs {{and put an}} upper time limit for continuous sound from them. New Jersey (Chapter 13:1G) considers a violation if the sound is continuous for more than 5 minutes or intermittent for more than 20 minutes. They also consider it a defense to violation if the animal is provoked to bark. Connecticut (Chapter 442)exempts animal sounds while Anchorage, AK (Chapter 15.70) requires that continual violations permit the animal to be taken and put out for adoption.|$|E
5000|$|This {{provision}} {{is both an}} [...] "objective emission control and a subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control.</b> It can set a maximum sound level at a specified distance (typically 50 feet).

5000|$|This {{provision}} is subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control.</b> It may contain a numerical level or a plainly audible term and a curfew. it {{is applied to}} specific sources of sound as opposed to any location at which the sound is created. It is applied primarily to amplified sound sources. Older provisions listed several items such as televisions, phonographs, etc. Changing the title to the above addresses the real issue and allows for novel sound production devices. Numerous communities have provisions for these devices; many use plainly audible as the criterion, such as Omaha, NE (Section 17-3) and Buffalo NY (Section 293-4) ...|$|E
50|$|This {{provision}} is a subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control</b> with a curfew. It {{is used in}} residential zones {{as well as in}} commercial areas abutting residential zones. Portland, OR (Title 18.10.030) has several ways to handle these tools. They separate outdoor and indoor use to different maximum levels at the property line. They have a night curfew and separate 5 HP tools from higher powered tools. Madison WI (Chapter 24.08) has similar HP restrictions. Albuquerque, NM (Title 9-9-7) restricts locations to more than 500 feet from residential and noise sensitive zones. Dallas, TX(Sec. 30-2) exempts lawn maintenance tools during daylight hours. Green Bay, WI (Subchapter II - 27.201) exempts snow removal tools.|$|E
50|$|This {{provision}} is a subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control.</b> It can contain a plainly audible term or a curfew. It {{is applied to}} commercial facilities using a sound system to deliberately propagate mostly speech, but also music. Most cities have provisions relevant to this subject. Lakewood, CO (Sections 9.52.06 and 09.52.160) used plainly audible as a regulatory tool and prohibits the sounding of bells, or chimes from 10pm to 7am. Charlotte, NC (Section 15-69(a)(4)) limits levels to 60 dB(A) at 50 feet from 9am to 9pm and 50 dB(A) at other times. Indianapolis, IN (Section 391-505) addresses broadcasts from aircraft. Connecticut (Section 22a-69-1.7) exempts bells, carillons, and chimes from religious facilities.|$|E
50|$|This {{provision}} is a subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control</b> with a curfew. If {{the activity is}} done in a residential zone, the Domestic Tools provision can be applied for the repairs, but this provision also {{is used for the}} testing phase of any repairs. Los Angeles, CA (Section 114.01) covers this violation in three ways. The first is application of the noise disturbance provision in residential districts between the hours of 8 pm to 8 am. The second is being plainly audible at a distance of 150 feet or more in residential districts between the hours of 8 pm to 8 am. The third is exceeding the presumed ambient by 5 dB. Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.7) prohibits this activity as a noise disturbance at any time.|$|E
50|$|This {{provision}} is a subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control.</b> It {{is designed to}} limit the noise disturbance between living units as defined by an enforcement official. One criterion used to evaluate that disturbance is use of plainly audible but {{at the location of}} the listener instead of at a specific distance. However, Charlotte, NC (Sec. 15-69) limits indoor levels to 55 dB(A) be tween 9am to 9pm and 5 dB less at other times, but only from sound reproducing devices. Salt Lake Valley Health Department (Chapter 4), Minneapolis, MN (Chapter 389), and Albuquerque, NM (Article 9) use levels to existing ambient to define a violation. Albuquerque NM and Omaha, NE (Chapter 17) require that intruding sounds not be audible. Burlington, VT (Chapter 18) requires that renters be supplied with the city noise ordinance.|$|E
50|$|This {{provision}} is a subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control.</b> It sets {{a time limit}} on engine activity. It can also place a curfew on any engine activity. e. In Salt Lake City, UT (Section 4.5.10(xi)) it is considered a noise disturbance if the operation lasts more than 15 minutes. Dallas, TX (Section 30-3.1) applies the code to vehicles over 14,000 GVWR; they must be more than 300 feet from a residential zone {{and there is a}} 10-minute maximum. They also provide a list of idling vehicles that are exempt from prosecution such as buses or active concrete trucks. Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.10) limits operation to 3 minutes in an hour for vehicles over 14,000 GVWR in either public or private property. It exempts buses and taxis. Massachusetts allows idling no more than 5 minutes.|$|E
50|$|This {{provision}} {{is both an}} objective emission control and a subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control</b> with a curfew. It can apply to {{both public and private}} properties. Since these vehicles can move in large open areas, an objective control, limiting maximum sound levels at a fixed distance is appropriate. Since they also can move in bounded areas near residences, a subjective control is appropriate. Numerous states and communities have objective controls; the most common maximum level is 78 dB(A). Federal law (36 CFR 2.18) regulates snowmobiles on federal property at 78 dB(A), so states and communities are free to regulate snowmobile sound levels on their property. Lincoln NE (Section 8.24.110) limits levels to 78 dB(A). Maine (Section 13112, Chapter 937) exempts snowmobiles at sanctioned racing events. Illinois (625 ILCS 40 Sec. 4-4)does also.|$|E
5000|$|This {{provision}} is a subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control</b> with a curfew. A propane cannon {{is used to}} keep animals and birds from destroying commercial crops. In large fields, many are used and fired as frequent intervals. The sound levels are equivalent to the firing of a small artillery cannon. The provision may contain requirements that {{limit the number of}} cannons permitted in a specific area and the number firings per hour for each cannon. many states have a Right to Farm Act that limits nuisance litigation. Florida (...) stated that it was a purpose of their act to protect reasonable agricultural activities conducted on farm land from nuisance suits. They also added a section that limited expand of operations without consideration of noise. Fairfax County, VA (Sections 105-4-4 and 108-5-1) require agricultural operation to meet maximum land use regulations and prohibit unnecessary noise. British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture (Farm Nuisance Noise document) have developed a comprehensive set of rules for cannon use.|$|E
50|$|This {{provision}} is a subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control</b> with a curfew. It {{has been used}} to regulate the sound of model aircraft on both private and public property. It applies to airborne, water-borne, and land-borne, unmanned vehicles. It makes no distinction between model vehicles and full-size unmanned vehicles. it applies also to the engines of those vehicles. Most regulations pertained to private unmanned vehicles, normally restricted to local open fields. The development of drones with microphones, cameras and GPS has opened the door to commercial use over wider private and public properties. Since federal preemption of drone use will likely occur, it is important for this provision to make the distinction. Salt Lake Health Department (Section 4.5.15) limits activity to 800 feet from a dwelling between 10 pm and 7 am, or if it cases a noise disturbance. Atlanta, GA (Section 74-136(b)) uses the plainly audible criterion across a residential property line, on a public property from 10 pm to 7 am on weekdays or from 10 pm to 10 am on weekends or holidays for any sound source.|$|E
50|$|This {{provision}} {{is both an}} objective emission control and a subjective <b>immission</b> <b>control</b> with a curfew. It can apply to {{both public and private}} properties. Since these vehicles can move in large open areas, an objective control, limiting maximum sound levels at a fixed distance, is appropriate. Since they also can move in bounded areas near residences, a subjective control is appropriate. Numerous states and cities have emission controls measured at 50 feet; the most common level is 82 dB(A), which is similar to that for motor vehicles on public rights-of-way. Colorado Springs, CO (Section 9.8.204.C) requires a minimum distance of 660 feet from residences. Portland, OR (Section 18.10.020.C) requires the area must be designated for recreational vehicle use. Salt Lake health Department, UT (Section 4.5.10(x)) requires off-highway vehicles to be at least 800 feet from a dwelling during the day and has a curfew from 10 pm to 7 am. They prohibit any noise disturbance and require sound levels to the less than 96 dB(A) at 50 feet.|$|E
50|$|This {{provision}} {{can be both}} {{a subjective}} <b>immission</b> <b>control</b> and an objective emission control. Normally there are daily curfews and in some case weekend curfews. The subjective aspect is to prevent noise disturbance in the adjacent community. The objective aspect is to control the sound output of specific machines. There are four major sources of site noise: (1) direct sound from continually operating equipment such as air compressors; (2) intermittent sound from equipment such as jack hammers;(3)backup alarms; and (4) hauling equipment such as trucks. Air compressor noise is regulated by CFR 204 and backup alarms are regulated by CFR 1926. Boston, MA(Section 16-26.4) permits construction on weekdays between 7am and 6 pm. Madison, WI (Chapter 24.08) limits sound levels to 88 dB(A) at 50 Feet. Miami, FL (Section 36-6) considers the noise a noise disturbance if it occurs between 6pm and 8am during the week and any time on Sunday. Dallas, TX (Section 30-2 (9)) permits construction in residential zones from 7am to 7pm on weekdays, from 9am to 7pm on Saturdays and Holidays, and prohibits construction on Sundays. Albuquerque,NM (Section 9-9-8) has a more complex control. It prohibits construction and demolition within 500 feet of noise sensitive properties (residences included) if the equipment sound control devices are less effective than the original equipment and if noise mitigation measures are not used when the levels exceed 90 dB (weighting not specified) or more than 80 dB during the day for three days.|$|E
