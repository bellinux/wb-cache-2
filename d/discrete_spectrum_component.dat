We {{consider}} two dynamical systems {{associated with}} a substitution of Pisot type: the usual Z-action on a sequence space, and the R-action, which {{can be defined as}} a tiling dynamical system or as a suspension flow. We describe procedures for checking when these systems have pure <b>discrete</b> <b>spectrum</b> (the “balanced pairs algorithm ” and the “overlap algorithm”) and study the relation between them.

As a corollary, we prove pure <b>discrete</b> <b>spectrum</b> for every R-action {{associated with a}} two-symbol substitution of Pisot type (this is conjectured for an arbitrary number of symbols). ...|$|R

We {{assume that the}} surface is asymptotically flat {{in the sense that}} the second fundamental form vanishes at infinity, and that the surface is not totally geodesic. This geometric setting is known as a quantum layer. We consider the quantum particle to be governed by the Dirichlet Laplacian as Hamiltonian.
