30|$|We {{have studied}} <b>the</b> {{capacitance}} effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> oscillation characteristics and the switching {{characteristics of the}} spin torque oscillators (STOs). We found that when the external field is applied, the STO oscillation frequency exhibits various <b>dependences</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> capacitance for injected current ranging from 8 to 20 mA. The switching characteristic is featured with the emerging of the canted region; the canted region increases with the capacitance. When the external field is absent, the STO free-layer switching time exhibits different <b>dependences</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> capacitance for different injected current. These results help to establish the foundation for capacitance-involved STO modeling.|$|R

5|$|The 2010 {{eruption}} of Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland highlighted {{the impacts of}} volcanic ash fall in modern society and our <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> functionality of infrastructure services. During this event the airline industry suffered business interruption losses of €1.5-2.5 billion from the closure of European airspace for six days in April 2010 and subsequent closures into May 2010. Ash fall from this event is also known to have caused local crop losses in agricultural industries, losses in the tourism industry, destruction of roads and bridges in Iceland (in combination with glacial melt water), and costs associated with emergency response and clean-up. However, across Europe there were further losses associated with travel disruption, the insurance industry, the postal service, and imports and exports across Europe and worldwide.

5|$|The {{profitability}} {{of the agricultural}} sector attracted foreign capital for railways and industries. British capital investments went from just over £20 million in 1880 to £157 million in 1890.

In 1890 Argentina was the destination of choice for British investment in Latin America, a position it held until World War I. By then, Argentina had absorbed between 40% and 50% of all British investment outside the United Kingdom.
