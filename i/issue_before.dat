5|$|After {{the merger}} with Fantastic, Mavor {{continued}} to draw well-known writers to the magazine, including Orson Scott Card, George R. R. Martin, and Roger Zelazny. Brad Linaweaver's Moon of Ice, {{which appeared in}} March 1982, {{was nominated for a}} Nebula award; Martin's Unsound Variations, which had appeared the <b>issue</b> <b>before,</b> was nominated for both a Nebula and a Hugo award.|$|E
5|$|On June 26, 2009, the House of Representatives {{approved}} the American Clean Energy and Security Act 219 to 212, mandating EPA to exclude ILUC for a 5-year period, {{vis a vis}} RFS2. During this period, more research is to be conducted to develop more reliable models and methodologies for estimating ILUC, and Congress will review this <b>issue</b> <b>before</b> allowing EPA to rule on this matter. The bill failed in the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{disagreed}} with the trial judge's finding with regard to locus standi. Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang, delivering the Court's judgment, opined that since according to the land register the temple was held in trust for San Jiao Sheng Tang Buddhist Association, of which the devotees were members, they had the requisite locus standi to bring the <b>issue</b> <b>before</b> the court.|$|E

5|$|The {{fears of}} {{terrorism}} received an extra boost from {{the disruption of}} communications and news as facilities were devoured by the fire. The General Letter Office in Threadneedle Street burned down early on Monday morning, through which post passed for the entire country. The London Gazette just managed to put out its Monday <b>issue</b> <b>before</b> the printer's premises went up in flames. The whole nation depended on these communications, and the void which they left filled up with rumours.|$|E
5|$|Smuggling off American coasts was an <b>issue</b> <b>before</b> the Revolutionary War, {{and after}} the Revolution it was more problematic. Along with smuggling, lack of {{shipping}} control, pirating, and a revenue unbalance were also major problems. In response, Hamilton proposed to Congress to enact a naval police force called revenue cutters in order to patrol the waters and assist the custom collectors with confiscating contraband. This idea was also proposed to assist in tariff controlling, boosting the American economy, and promote the merchant marine. It is thought that his experience obtained during his apprenticeship with Nicholas Kruger was influential in his decision-making.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of World War I (also known as the First World War or the Great War), Southern Rhodesia was {{administered}} by the British South Africa Company, which had controlled it and Northern Rhodesia since acquiring them through diplomacy and conquest during the 1890s. The white population in Southern Rhodesia stood at 23,606 in 1911 (a minority of 3%), while Northern Rhodesia had about 3,000 white settlers (less than half of 1%). With the Company's charter due to expire in late 1914, most Southern Rhodesian public attention was focused on this <b>issue</b> <b>before</b> the outbreak of war. The settlers were split between those who backed continued administration by the Chartered Company and those who advocated responsible government, which would make Southern Rhodesia a self-governing colony within the British Empire. Still others favoured the integration of Southern Rhodesia into the Union of South Africa, which had been formed in 1910. Following {{the intervention of the}} war, the charter was renewed for 10 years in early 1915.|$|E

5|$|The Nixon {{presidency}} {{witnessed the}} first large-scale integration {{of public schools}} in the South. Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites. Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political <b>issue</b> <b>before</b> then. Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools. Agnew had little interest in the work, and most of it was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz. Federal aid was available, and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees. By September 1970, less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools. By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance. Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use.|$|E

25|$|Consequently, the <b>issue</b> <b>before</b> us is {{not whether}} a State can execute the innocent.

25|$|The Supreme Court {{concluded}} that the Second Circuit should decide {{in the first instance}} whether to remand to the District Court to allow Iqbal to seek leave to amend his deficient complaint.

25|$|The <b>issue</b> <b>before</b> this Court {{is whether}} the {{definition}} of spouse in the Old Age Security Act creates a distinction {{in the distribution of}} benefits which is discriminatory on the basis of sexual orientation. That issue cannot be resolved simply by stating that the distinction drawn by the Act is based on the definition of spouse rather than on sexual orientation. It is, after all, the definition of spouse that is being attacked as discriminatory.|$|E
25|$|The morning newspaper, the Montgomery Advertiser, began {{publication}} as The Planter's Gazette in 1829. It is {{the principal}} newspaper of central Alabama and is affiliated with the Gannett Corporation. In 1970, then publisher Harold E. Martin won the Pulitzer Prize for special reporting while at the Advertiser. The Alabama Journal was a local afternoon paper from 1899 until April 16, 1993, when it published its last <b>issue</b> <b>before</b> merging with the morning Advertiser.|$|E

Mayor Bell, who previously served as interim Mayor in 1999, won a special election on January 19, 2010, to fill the unexpired term of former Mayor Larry Langford.|$|E

Because Washington requires a three-day waiting period (excluding the day of <b>issue)</b> <b>before</b> a marriage certificate may be signed, the first same-sex marriages in the state took place on December 9, 2012.|$|E

For years the NAACP used petition drives, letters to newspapers, articles, posters, lobbying Congress, and marches to protest against the abuses in the South and keep the <b>issue</b> <b>before</b> the public.|$|E
