25|$|An American sentry, Air Force Staff Sergeant Alfredo R. Guerrero, was {{stationed}} atop Building #131. He witnessed the men, recognised the vehicles as a threat, reported it to security, {{and began a}} floor by floor evacuation of the building. His actions are credited with saving dozens of lives. Many of the evacuees were in the stairwell when the bomb went off. The stairwell was constructed of heavy marble and was located {{on the side of}} the building away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> bomb, perhaps the safest location in the building. For his actions, Guerrero was awarded the Airman's Medal, the highest peacetime award for valour that the U.S. Air Force gives.|$|E

25|$|It {{was against}} {{regulations}} for officers {{to drive a}} convoy vehicle, but First Lieutenant Ben Keating took the wheel while returning an armored supply truck to the Naray FOB. He wanted to avoid risking {{the lives of his}} men while traveling on an unstable road subject to ambush with an overweight vehicle. During the highly risky convoy, the road collapsed under the weight of Keating's vehicle. He was thrown <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> and it rolled over him and sank into the Landay-Sin river. His death had a traumatic effect on the morale of 3-71 Cav. The Allies stopped using the Kamdesh-Naray road as a result.|$|E

25|$|Preliminary {{underwater}} {{inspections of}} the Norman Atlantic {{revealed that the}} water intake pipes of the fire sprinkler system were clogged with mussels; additional inspections are necessary to determine if this blockage contributed to the fire's spreading. Although the voyage data recorder (black box) has been recovered, still by mid-March no data have been extracted, apparently because {{the heat of the}} fire caused the plastic to melt onto the hard disk. Recordings of the Voyage data recorder published on 7 October 2015, say that the fire sprinkler system wasn't working correctly and instead of spraying water there was smoke coming from the system. The investigations also state that there was a truck that had the engine working. Smoke was coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> prior to the fire.|$|E

25|$|In 2014, Brendan Gaughan {{and crew}} chief Shane Wilson moved up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Truck</b> Series to the Nationwide Series, {{bringing}} family-owned South Point Hotel, Casino & Spa and longtime number 62 with him.

Gaughan scored his first career Nationwide win at Road America in June, after struggling early and sliding off the track on several occasions, but gaining an advantage as downpours forced the competitors to switch to treaded rain tires. When pole-sitter Alex Tagliani ran out of fuel before a Green-White-Checkered finish, Gaughan assumed the lead and fended off Chase Elliott and a hard-charging Tagliani (on fresh slick tires). Brendan dedicated the win to his late grandfather Jackie Gaughan. Gaughan scored his second win of the season at Kentucky in September, passing teammate Ty Dillon on the final restart. Gaughan scored a total of seven top tens to finish eighth in points.|$|E

2500|$|Ryan P. Doom {{explains}} how the violence devolves {{as the film}} progresses. [...] "The savagery of American violence," [...] he says, [...] "begins with Chigurh's introduction: a quick one-two punch of strangulation and a bloody cattle gun. The strangulation in particular demonstrates {{the level of the}} Coens' capability to create realistic carnage-to allow the audience to understand the horror that violence delivers.....Chigurh kills a total of 12 (possibly more) people, and, curiously enough, the violence devolves as the film progresses. During {{the first half of the}} film, the Coens never shy from unleashing Chigurh ... The devolution of violence starts with Chigurh's shootout with Moss in the motel. Aside <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> owner who is shot in the head after Moss flags him down, both the motel clerk and Wells's death occur offscreen. Wells's death in particular demonstrates that murder means nothing. Calm beyond comfort, the camera pans away when Chigurh shoots Wells with a silenced shotgun as the phone rings. He answers. It is Moss, and while they talk, blood oozes across the room toward Chigurh's feet. Not moving, he places his feet up on the bed and continues the conversation as the blood continues to spread across the floor. By the time he keeps his promise of visiting Carla Jean, the resolution and the violence appear incomplete. Though we're not shown Carla Jean's death, when Chigurh exits and checks the bottom of his socks [...] for blood, it's a clear indication that his brand of violence has struck again." ...|$|E
