40|$|Background. Eosinophilic {{gastroenteritis}} (EGE) {{is a rare}} {{disorder of}} unknown etiology, characterised by infiltrating eosinophils into one or more layers of gastrointestinal tract and various gastrointestinal manifestations. Signs and symptoms {{are related to the}} layer and extent of bowel involved with eosinophilic infiltration bowel with mucosa, muscle, subserosa or all three affected. Steroid therapy remains the corner stone of treatment. Patients and methods. This paper describes a case of 70 -yearold male patient with eosinophilic mucosal disease of upper intestinal wall repeatedly admitted because of <b>epigastralgias,</b> nausea, vomiting and losing weight. Because of hypereosinophilia, a biopsy of duodenal mucosa was performed, despite the normal endoscopic appearance. Numerous eosinophilic infiltrates were histologically confirmed in mucosa and submucosa and remission followed metilprednisolon therapy. Results. After two years signs of ilness reapearred, and again metilprednisolon therapy was followed by remission which still last. Conclusions. EGE needs to be recognized by the clinician because it can masquerade as the irritable bowel syndrome. The diagnosis of EGE is confirmed by a characteristic biopsy. Treatment is empiric and gauged to the severity of the clinical manifestations. </p...|$|R

The pathology of bronchoscopic tissue biopsy showed small cell lung cancer. During hospitalization, he complained of <b>epigastralgia</b> with radiation to the back. The blood test showed elevated amylase and lipase levels. The {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) revealed swollen pancreas but no choledocholithiasis. Acute pancreatitis was diagnosed. Pancreatitis re-lapsed again after conservative treatment. After reviewing the previous imaging study, a low-density lesion in the pancreas was found. Metastasis induced acute pancreatitis (MIAP) was suspected. We gave him systemic chemotherapy with the regimen of etoposide and cis-platin. Abdominal pain subsided quickly and the serum level of amylase and lipase returned to normal range later. During the regular follow-up in the outpatient clinics, he did not experience the same episode again. In the literature, the majority of MIAP is caused by small cell lung cancer.

40|$|Background. Evidence of gastric {{metastasis}} from {{lung cancer}} is rarely observed at initial diagnosis. Case 1. A 74 -year-old woman with anorexia {{was referred to}} our hospital due to upper lobe atelectasis of the left lung noted on a chest X-ray film. Bronchoscopic examination revealed obstruction of the left upper bronchus by a tumor. A biopsy specimen from the mass demonstrated small cell cancer. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed an elevated lesion forming a central depression ("bull's eye") in the antrum. Immunohistochemical examination confirmed metastasis from small cell lung cancer. Despite chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide, the patient {{did not respond to}} treatment and died of lung cancer 3 months after admission. Case 2. A 76 -year-old man with a chief complaint of <b>epigastralgia</b> was given a diagnosis of small cell lung cancer of the right lower lobe. Endoscopic examination revealed an elevated lesion forming a "bull's eye" in the gastric corpus. A biopsy specimen from the tumor demonstrated metastasis from small cell lung cancer, and he died of lung cancer 1 month after diagnosis. Conclusion. Opportunities to identify gastric metastasis from lung cancer are likely to increase with the increasing incidence of lung cancer. On diagnosis of gastric metastasis, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is useful for proper staging and treatment. The possibility of gastric metastasis should be considered when patients complain of anorexia or <b>epigastralgia</b> at initial diagnosis. © 2012 The Japan Lung Cancer Society...|$|E

Case 2 : A 35 -year-old married female complained of severa epigastric dull pain, naused, and vomitting. Upper GI series revealed multiple irregular depressed lesions, but no narrowing of the antrum of the stomach. Endoscopic examination revealed multiple irregular depressed lesions and surrounding edema on the total circle of the antrum of the stomach. Case 3 : A 20 -year-old unmarried female complained of severa <b>epigastralgia</b> with nausea and loss of appetite. Upper GI series revaled scattered and small spots of the antrum of the stomach. Endoscopic examination revealed multiple shallow erosions with easy-bleeding tendency on the total circle of the antrum of the stomach. In the examination, these three cases were suspected of malignant lesion (case 1, 3) or acute gastric mucosal lesion (case 2). There was no healing tendency by treatment with H_ 2 receptor antagonist, and biopsy speciments showed non-specific inflammation on all cases. Consequently, these three cases were diagnoses as gastric syphilis with latent syphilis, because of the strong positive reaction of serological test for syphilis and foregoing observations.
