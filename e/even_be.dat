5|$|Bonaparte had {{identified}} another tooth, MACN Pv-RN 252, {{as a possible}} Ferugliotherium lower premolar in 1990, but this fossil is very fragmentary and according to Krause and colleagues, it cannot <b>even</b> <b>be</b> {{proven to be a}} mammalian tooth.|$|E
5|$|Loitering munitions may be {{as simple}} as an {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle (UAV) with attached explosives that is sent on a potential kamikaze mission, and may <b>even</b> <b>be</b> constructed with off the shelf commercial quadcopters with strapped on explosives.|$|E
5|$|The {{jury was}} impanelled on January 18. The {{indictment}} was read and Cannon delivered his opening statement. Most {{of the evidence}} pertained to the robbery counts, resulting in speculation that the other counts would not <b>even</b> <b>be</b> tried if a robbery conviction could be obtained.|$|E

5|$|The {{spectral}} {{properties of}} the halo ring {{are different from the}} main ring. The flux distribution in the range 0.5–2.5μm is flatter than in the main ring; the halo is not red and may <b>even</b> <b>be</b> blue.|$|E
5|$|As he lies dying {{under the}} abbey's rubble, Zerchi is startled to {{encounter}} Mrs Grales/Rachel, a bicephalous tomato peddler and mutant. However, Mrs. Grales has been rendered unconscious by the explosion, {{and may be}} dying herself. As Zerchi tries to conditionally baptize Rachel, she refuses, and instead takes the ciborium and administers the Eucharist to him. It is implied that she is, like the Virgin Mary, Eve and Jesus, exempt from original sin, and may <b>even</b> <b>be</b> the Second Coming of Christ to begin a new cycle on Earth. Zerchi soon dies, having witnessed an apparent miracle.|$|E

5|$|B.integrifolia is {{a highly}} {{variable}} species. It is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (80ft) in height, but in sheltered locations it can reach 35 metres (110ft). In more exposed areas it may grow as a small, gnarled tree, reaching {{to no more than}} about 5 metres (15ft), and in highly exposed positions, such as on exposed coastal headlands, it may <b>even</b> <b>be</b> reduced to a small shrub.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises a gene is difficult. Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do not necessarily have {{to be close to}} the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can be much larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can <b>even</b> <b>be</b> on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome.|$|E
5|$|Fears then arose for the engine's future, the {{speculation}} being {{that it might}} remain in the US or <b>even</b> <b>be</b> broken up. After Alan Bloom made a personal phone call to him in January 1973, William McAlpine stepped in and bought the locomotive for £25,000 direct from the finance company in San Francisco docks. After its return to the UK via the Panama Canal in February 1973, McAlpine paid for the locomotive's restoration at Derby Works.|$|E
25|$|Recall {{that the}} square of an <b>even</b> number <b>is</b> <b>even</b> and {{the square of}} an odd number is odd. So if {{the square of the}} {{hypotenuse}} <b>is</b> <b>even</b> the hypotenuse <b>is</b> <b>even</b> as well.|$|R

The hosts for the <b>evening</b> <b>were</b> Austin O'Brien, Trevor O'Brien, Cody McMains, Michelle Trachtenberg, Kaitlin Cullum and Kimberly Cullum. Performers for {{the evening}} included, Girls On-Q, Adam Nicholson, Adam Wylie and Blake McIver Ewing.|$|R
5|$|In some stories, kitsune have {{difficulty}} hiding their tails {{when they take}} human form; looking for the tail, perhaps when the fox gets drunk or careless, is a common method of discerning the creature's true nature. A particularly devout individual may in some cases <b>even</b> <b>be</b> able to see through a fox's disguise merely by perceiving them. Kitsune may also be exposed while in human form by their fear and hatred of dogs, and some become so rattled by their presence that they revert to {{the form of a}} fox and flee.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to consider matrices with infinitely many rows and/or columns even if, being infinite objects, one cannot write down such matrices explicitly. All that matters is that for every element in the set indexing rows, and every element in the set indexing columns, there is a well-defined entry (these index sets need not <b>even</b> <b>be</b> subsets of the natural numbers). The basic operations of addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and transposition can still be defined without problem; however matrix multiplication may involve infinite summations to define the resulting entries, and these are not defined in general.|$|E
5|$|Most {{stars are}} between 1 billion and 10 billion years old. Some stars may <b>even</b> <b>be</b> close to 13.8 billion years old—the {{observed}} {{age of the}} universe. The oldest star yet discovered, HD 140283, nicknamed Methuselah star, is an estimated 14.46 ± 0.8 billion years old. (Due to the uncertainty in the value, this age for the star does not conflict with {{the age of the}} Universe, determined by the Planck satellite as 13.799 ± 0.021).|$|E

5|$|Not all slaves had {{the same}} social status. Some slaves of wealthy {{families}} lived better than commoners since {{they were allowed to}} wear luxurious clothes and consume quality food and wine. Slaves of high officials could <b>even</b> <b>be</b> feared and respected. The slaves of regent Huo Guang (d. 68 BCE) sometimes came armed to the marketplace and fought commoners, forced the Imperial Secretary to kowtow and apologize (after a scuffle with his slaves over the right-of-way on the street), and were provided services by some officials who sought a promotion through Huo Guang's influence.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans {{are among}} the most {{intelligent}} primates; they use a variety of sophisticated tools and construct elaborate sleeping nests each night from branches and foliage. The apes have been extensively studied for their learning abilities. There may <b>even</b> <b>be</b> distinctive cultures within populations. Field studies of the apes were pioneered by primatologist Birutė Galdikas. All three orangutan species are considered to be critically endangered. Human activities have caused severe declines in populations and ranges. Threats to wild orangutan populations include poaching, habitat destruction, and the illegal pet trade. Several conservation and rehabilitation organisations are dedicated to the survival of orangutans in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Other researchers, like Larry Martin {{believe that}} dromaeosaurids, {{along with all}} maniraptorans are not dinosaurs at all. Martin {{asserted}} for decades that birds were unrelated to maniraptorans, but in 2004 he changed his position, and now he agrees that the two are the closest of relatives. Martin believes that maniraptorans are secondarily flightless birds, and that birds evolved from non–dinosaurian archosaurs, so {{that most of the}} species formerly called theropods would now not <b>even</b> <b>be</b> classified as dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species of}} Lactarius, Lactifluus and Russula are valued as {{excellent}} edible mushrooms. This {{is the case}} for example for the north temperate species Lactarius deliciosus, Lactifluus volemus, or Russula vesca, and other species are popular {{in other parts of the}} world, e.g. Lactarius indigo in Mexico, or Lactifluus edulis in tropical Africa. Some species, like Russula vesca, can <b>even</b> <b>be</b> eaten raw. The brittle texture of Russula fruitbodies makes them different from other mushrooms and is not appreciated by some.|$|E
5|$|Stylidium habitat {{includes}} grassy plains, open heaths, rocky slopes, sandplains, forests, and {{the margins}} of creeks and water holes. Somes species, such as S. eglandulosum, can <b>even</b> <b>be</b> found in disturbed areas like near roads and under powerlines. Others (i.e. S. coroniforme) are sensitive to disturbance and are considered rare because of their extremely specific habitat.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett finds a strange, disfigured man (Chris Owens) in the X-Files office and, on his whim, they test his DNA. They learn that the man shares DNA with Fox Mulder (Duchovny), and may possibly <b>even</b> <b>be</b> him. The answers become even more surprising when Scully's son, baby William, is put on the line.|$|E
