5|$|Anderton {{goes to a}} {{black market}} <b>doctor</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> risky eye {{transplant}} {{so as to avoid}} the citywide optical recognition system. He returns to PreCrime and kidnaps Agatha, shutting down the system, as the Precogs operate as a group mind. Anderton takes Agatha to a hacker to extract the minority report of Leo Crow, but none exists; instead, Agatha shows him an image of the murder of Ann Lively, a woman who was drowned by a hooded figure in 2049.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{arrived in}} New York on 20 October 1953 to {{undertake}} another tour of poetry-reading and talks, organised by Brinnin. Although he complained of chest trouble and gout {{while still in}} Britain, {{there is no record}} that he received medical treatment for either condition. He was in a melancholy mood about the trip and his health was poor; he relied on an inhaler to aid his breathing and there were reports that he was suffering from blackouts. His visit to say goodbye to BBC producer Philip Burton, a few days before he left for New York, was interrupted by a blackout. On his last night in London he had another in the company of his fellow poet Louis MacNeice. The next day he visited a <b>doctor</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> smallpox-vaccination certificate.|$|E
25|$|By 1966, however, it {{was clear}} that Hartnell's health was {{affecting}} his performances, and {{that he would not be}} able to carry on playing the <b>Doctor</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long period of time. By this point Savory had moved on as Head of Serials and his successor, Shaun Sutton, was more agreeable to change, allowing Wiles' replacement, Innes Lloyd, to make many of the very changes that Wiles had been barred from. Lloyd discussed the situation with Hartnell and the actor agreed that it would be best to leave, although later in life he would claim that he had not wanted to go.|$|E

500|$|Dr. Stephan Lynn, {{head of the}} Emergency Department, who {{had been}} called in again after having just {{returned}} home after a 13-hour-long work shift, received Lennon {{in the emergency room}} at Roosevelt Hospital a few minutes before 11:00 pm, when Officers Frauenberger and Moran arrived, with Moran carrying Lennon on his back from their squad car and onto a gurney, into the emergency room demanding a <b>doctor</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> multiple gunshot wound victim. When Lennon arrived, he had no pulse and was not breathing. Dr. Lynn, two other doctors, a nurse, and two or three other medical attendants worked on Lennon for 10 to 15 minutes {{in a desperate attempt to}} resuscitate him. As a last resort, Dr. Lynn cut open Lennon's chest and attempted manual heart massage to restore circulation, but he quickly discovered that the damage to the blood vessels above and around Lennon's heart from the multiple bullet wounds was too great.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}} {{season for the}} Fourth Doctor, he {{acquired}} three companions (Adric, Tegan, and Nyssa), and this situation continued under the Fifth <b>Doctor</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while.

2500|$|Staley was {{diagnosed}} with AIDS-Related Complex (ARC) in 1985, after seeing a <b>doctor</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> persistent cold. In 1987, after being handed a flyer {{on his way to}} work prior to the first demonstration by ACT UP (AIDS Coalition To Unleash Power), he decided to attend the next meeting. Although he had come out to his family, Staley remained closeted at work, working as a bond trader by day and chairing ACT UP's fundraising operations by night, before coming out at work and going on disability leave. On March 24, 1988, he took part in an ACT UP demonstration on Wall Street on {{the first anniversary of the}} group. At that demonstration, he was in one of the first waves of people sitting in the street to block traffic, and was interviewed by a local TV station who broadcast his image with the caption [...] "Peter Staley, AIDS victim." ...|$|E
2500|$|Individuals {{with private}} or {{government}} insurance {{are limited to}} medical facilities which accept the particular type of medical insurance they carry. Visits to facilities outside the insurance program's [...] "network" [...] are usually either not covered or the patient must bear more of the cost. Hospitals negotiate with insurance programs to set reimbursement rates; some rates for government insurance programs are set by law. The sum paid to a <b>doctor</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> service rendered to an insured patient is generally less than that paid [...] "out of pocket" [...] by an uninsured patient. In return for this discount, the insurance company includes the doctor {{as part of their}} [...] "network", which means more patients are eligible for lowest-cost treatment there. The negotiated rate may not cover the cost of the service, but providers (hospitals and doctors) can refuse to accept a given type of insurance, including Medicare and Medicaid. Low reimbursement rates have generated complaints from providers, and some patients with government insurance have difficulty finding nearby providers for certain types of medical services.|$|E
40|$|A {{terminally ill}} man {{requests}} {{that his life}} be brought to a peaceful end by the doctor overseeing his care. The doctor, an atheist, regretfully declines.

During the ensuing dialogue the philosophical, ethical and emotional arguments brought to bear by both the doctor and the patient are dissected...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the radio}} series, [...] "Doc" [...] Adams was {{initially}} a self-interested and somewhat dark character with a predilection for constantly attempting {{to increase his}} revenue through the procurement of autopsy fees. However, McNear's performances steadily became more warm-hearted and sympathetic. Most notably, this transformation began during (and progressed steadily following) the July 1952 episode [...] "Never Pester Chester," [...] in which a physician with a more compassionate and devoted temperament {{is essential to the}} plotline when Chester is near-fatally injured by two trouble-making Texas drovers. Doc Adams' backstory evokes a varied and experienced life: In some episodes, he had educational ties to Philadelphia; in others, he spent time as ship's doctor aboard the gambling boats that plied the Mississippi River, which provided a background for his knowledge of New Orleans (and acquaintance with Mark Twain). In the January 31, 1953, episode [...] "Cavalcade", a fuller history is offered, though subsequent programs kept close listeners' heads spinning. In [...] "Cavalcade", his real name is Calvin Moore, educated in Boston, and he practiced as a <b>doctor</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> year in Richmond, Virginia, where {{he fell in love with}} a beautiful young woman who was also being courted by a wealthy young man named Roger Beauregard. Beauregard forced Doc into fighting a duel with him, resulting in Beauregard's being shot and killed. Though it was a fair duel, because Doc was a Yankee and an outsider, he was forced to flee. The young woman fled after him and they were married in St. Louis, but two months later, she died of typhus. Doc wandered throughout the territories until he settled in Dodge City 17 years later under the name of [...] "Charles Adams". The Adams moniker was another Conrad invention, borrowing the surname from cartoonist Charles Addams as a testament to Doc's initially ghoulish comportment.|$|E

50|$|Peri {{travels with}} the <b>Doctor</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{undisclosed}} period of time; some sources say she travels {{with him for}} mere months, while others say years. Between the events of Revelation of the Daleks and the season-long story The Trial of a Time Lord, the character is shown to have matured somewhat (coinciding with an 18-month production break between the two stories) and her relationship with the Doctor becomes less combative.|$|R

Kucinich planned to introduce the impeachment articles on April 24, 2007, but in light of Cheney's visit to his <b>doctor</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> inspection of a blood clot, Kucinich decided to postpone the scheduled press conference [...] "until the vice president's condition is clarified." ...|$|R
