As Sherwood explains, [...] "The original Leatherface, Chainsaw 3, took {{the idea of the}} backwoods isolation of the original and exploded it tenfold. I always think of the locations of this film—the scrub brush filled badlands and remote roadside outposts as feeling like another world—a dark fairy tale land in some way. I filled my story with similar locations to hopefully capture a similar vibe." [...] The fictional Sawyer farm is a key location in Leatherface, which was rebuilt to accurately resemble its appearance in the first Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The farm was originally going to be used sparingly, until Sherwood discussed the matter with directors Maury and Bustillo. Sherwood stated, [...] "Developing the script with the directors was actually just super-easy. We knew {{what we wanted to do}} from the start, and they got it and they were right along with me. I didn't have the farmhouse a lot and they were like 'If we are going to build the set and this is the famous farmhouse, we should use it' and <b>I</b> <b>totally</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> that.

[...] The Sawyer homestead was adduced by cinematographer Antoine Sanier as being particularly rousing to film: [...] "It's a real house that has been shot many times, but we cannot see it very well [...] It's always a little bit hidden or dark, so it was really impressive to get into this process and also to be a link to the other guys that have been shooting this kind of set." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to {{critically}} review Pierre Bourdieus contribution to agency – structure debate. I will do this {{with help from the}} thinking of George Herbert Mead. My aim is to show that Mead can provide valuable knowledge to Bourdieus theory. Pierre Bourdieus notion of habitus is his solution to the dilemma between agency and structure. It is in the habitus that the objective structures meet the inner, subjective structures and this results in various actions. Bourdieu claims that the relation between the habitus and the outer structures causes dispositions to ‘ways of reacting’. His aim with the notion of habitus is to show why the society follows an often strict regularity. Bourdieus is however often accused of being a determinist. <b>I</b> do not <b>totally</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> this criticism but I claim that Bourdieus hasn’t done enough to stipulate his middle way between freedom and constraint and agency and structure. The habitus seems to be more or less immune to mayor upset. Bourdieu is often unclear of how the individual uses his dispositions in various situations. Bourdieus is letting the habitus to too much work. He sometimes seems to forget that it is an individual beyond the habitus. He underestimates the power of humans to make choices of their own. There seems to be more to the notion of agency then the habitus can fully capture. Thus we turn to the thinking of George Herbert Mead. I claim that Mead offers a way out of Bourdieus dilemma between agency and structure. He does this by focusing on what happens in the particular situation. Mead believes that the society reproduces itself in two different ways. There is the ‘unreflexive’ way which has certain similarities with Bourdieus way of thinking. The main difference between Mead and Bourdieu is that Mead claims that there is another way that the society reproduces itself. This is what he calls the reflexive reproduction. If the individual encounters resistance he/she becomes aware of the habitual expectations he/she brought in to the situation. The resistance causes a break in the world the individual takes for granted. The individual then reflexively adapt there actions to the situation. The break makes the individual aware of the world, and this is what lacks in Bourdieus theory. The individual can think and also act in opposite to their habits or habitus. This is what can cause the habitus to change...|$|R

In the area in which I do much of my own research, sports injury, this point has also previously been made by myself 2 and other leading commentators. 3 4 Unfortunately, as also pointed out by Pless, 1 there continues to be significant misunder-standing of exactly what surveillance should be, and the sports injury literature still contains many papers supposedly reporting injury surveillance studies based on retro-spective recall of injuries by athletes, detailed monitoring of injuries over a targeted, limited-term period (such as over a football season) or other ad hoc data collection activities. It {{is hard to see how}} the field will develop further without due attention to appropriate surveil-lance methodology and a wider embracing of the data collection methodologies continually being improved in the broader injury field. Pless 1 also questions whether any surveillance system can, in fact, contribute to prevention.

40|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{mark of the}} war between the states of Wu and Yue was its brutality, which was significantly different from other inter-states wars during the Spring and Autumn Era. The main cause of this discrepancy may be because {{the fact that there}} was no aristocracy existed in the Wu and Yue. This historical factor led to the distinctiveness of these two states’ political, military and bureaucratic systems. It was also because of this factor the Wu and Yue never had a need to break the resistance of aristocrats through the process of 'social mobility' as other Eastern Zhou states did. The statement that 'there were no aristocrats in the Wu and Yue' is based on solid studies of both historical documents as well as archaeological discoveries. This phenomenon had a close relationship with the way these two states developed. Comparing with Chu and Qin, the other two non-central land states, Wu and Yue were relatively isolated and did not have much cultural exchanges with the central land. Because of this isolation, the Wu and Yue had the opportunities to develop from chiefdoms into states, which made their power structures very centralized. In Xie Weiyang 謝維揚`s theory, he thought that the state of Yue was a chiefdom before rising up, and Zhang Guangzhi 張光直 and Duan Yu 段渝 pointed out that Liangzhu Culture was the chiefdom. Although <b>I</b> do not <b>totally</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the theory of Xie Weiyang, but I believe that the Wu and Yue are both chiefdoms before they finished their evolution and became states. The main reason I use the concept of “chiefdom” to explain the socio-political conditions of the Wu and Yue is because if a state was developed from chiefdom, its government would own centralized power, which was entirely different from the states which came from the “confederacy of tribes 部落聯盟” such as in the early history of Greece and Rome. This was the root cause that the power of the kings in these two states was far more powerful than in other Spring and Autumn states. Geostrategic environment is another factor which could affect the whole Wu-Yue War. The war between the Wu and Yue was inevitable, but during the early period of the Wu-Yue war, the participation of the Chu and Jin was obvious, and in the latter stages of the war, Wu and Yue had become very strong and powerful themselves so that the influence of Jin and Chu towards this war was weaker and nearly invisible. Thanks to several external and internal factors, the Yue could start and implement its Grand Strategy, and the final destruction of the Wu was the indication mark of the successful implementation of the Grand Strategy. The definition of the Grand Strategy is that: coordinating all resources and elements of national power (economic, political, and military) to accomplish a national goal - mainly against external threats. Anyone who knows a little of the Yue history will know the phrase - 'one Decade of preparations and accumulation 十年生養'. This phrase includes many subjects, such as the military strategies, political policies, economic measures, etc, and all these measures were around one strategic goal: Destroying Wu. I think this is precisely consistent with the definition of The Grand Strategy, which is the reason why I use The Grand Strategy to explain the history of Yue. The warfare between the Wu and Yue was the main driving force behind the formation of the “Wu-Yue Culture” and possibly one of the reasons for the development of the distinctive “Wu-Yue Culture Region”. There is some documental and archaeological evidence to prove this viewpoint. The formation of the Wu-Yue Culture was so solid that the Chu could not effectively control the area of the Wu and Yue even after its successful occupation of the Yue, as it did to other states which located in the Huai 淮 River and Si 泗 River. It seems that a strong feeling of group identity had gradually formed with the process of the formation of Wu-Yue Culture, although the Yue controlled the Wu area for not a very long time...|$|R

If you do not, give {{examples}} of success stories in recent Indian medical education and practice benefiting poor patients. Ans: I agree with the author totally. I was fortunate to have studied under many teachers under whom he too had studied in the medical college. As Dr. Pandya described in his article, many of our teachers were compassionate, sincere, highly professional and considerate individuals. <b>I</b> <b>totally</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Dr. Pandya's views. The unprofessional and unethical acts of the present day teachers and medical practitioners sadden us. I hear of the examples indicating the prevalence of greed, corruption, plagiarism and favoritism every time I visit India. It is sad that the noble profession of medicine is maligned by unscrupulous and uncouth individuals. Q 2 : The author does not consider the steps to be taken by the authorities. Can the Government, municipal corporations, associations of doctors, medical councils improve matters? If so, what steps do you suggest?Ans: The first choice must be, 'Physician, heal thyself. ' Dr. Pandya has aptly emphasized that the 'unprofessional acts of teachers are likely to be followed by students. ' (I would say they are being followed by many of their students). The healing process should begin with: 1. Mandatory courses in medical ethics for medical students and house staff in medical colleges 2. Nationwide mandatory conferences in medical ethics for the education of practicing physicians from all branches of Medicine, including teachers in medical colleges. One physician from Mumbai approached me during one of my visits and offered to pay the US Government officials to get a visa and a Residency position in a US hospital. He could not pass the Visa Qualifying Examination. I told him to get out. 3. The basis of education in schools and colleges should be to create good citizens out of students. On the contrary, the teachers are encouraging delinquency. Unless the schools and colleges introduce a curriculum to prevent bribery, plagiarism, unprofessional behavior and selfishness, the domino effect on various professions and businesses will not end. 4 Unfortunately, regulating bodies such as Government, municipal corporations and medical councils are the propagating institutions for such practices. They will gladly develop laws and regulatory policies for punitive actions against physicians, with the resultant consequence of handing power to the administrators who in turn resort to corrupt practices. The corrupt administrators can then extract bribes from such physicians. [No abstract available. ...|$|E

This Conceptual art work has multiple layers of meanings, which all corresponds to the Western expectations for a successful contemporary Chinese artist. In fact, the Western art world has long held bias and stereotypes towards international artists. Ai chose to perform his personality to conform to the expectations and Western ideologies, which brought him international fame.

In the high temperature limit, the results <b>totally</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> those obtained using Wigner’s perturbative method of deriving quantum corrections {{to the classical}} distribution function. Comparison with the perturbative approach allows one to establish the range of applicability of the latter.

Furthermore, the time-evolution of the WFs for a state initially located {{at one of the}} wells has been also investigated to show the tunneling effect...|$|R
40|$|This {{would appear}} to be a perfect example of the HESS-D {{approach}} to open com-mentary and discussion on submitted papers being very valuable. The discussion in my paper and the comments by Erwin Zehe encapsulate an on-going discussion that will, in fact, run for the foreseeable future because it has to do as much with a matter of beliefs as with the science. I would very much hope that hydrologists and hydro-logical modellers who have not been invited to review the paper will contribute to the discussion. The fundamental issue here arises immediately when Erwin suggests that the title is not appropriate. <b>I</b> <b>totally</b> <b>agree</b> that closure is normal in other disciplines and should S 339 be the basis for hydrological modelling. However, it should also be pointed out, that we also have some rather tenuous sub-element parameterisations in common, though there is always resort to the argument that these will be improved in the future. But my argument is precisely that the difficulty of characterising the surface and subsurface flow domains will make any such improvements difficult (and perhaps impossible) i...|$|R

We also illustrate the way in which Zipf's law can be understood in a thermodynamical context as the surface of a finite system. Finally, we derive an equivalent microscopic description of our systems which <b>totally</b> <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> previous numerical simulations found in the literature...|$|R

This work {{is intended to}} be a report of the parasitic controls in anchovies (Engraulis enchrasicolus) sampled in the fish market in San Benedetto del Tronto (AP, Marche), caught in the middle Adriatic Sea from July 2005 to October 2006. Out of 5696 observed anchovies, 326 (5. 72 %) were infested with anisakidae larvae: 273 (4. 79 %) with Anisakis larvae, 70 (1. 23 %) with Hysterothylacium larvae and 17 (0. 3 %) with both genera. Fishes over 130 mm long showed to be more infested and a positive trend of infestation depending on fish size was statistically detected.

40|$|In cosmology, it {{has been}} a long-standing problem to {{establish}} a parameter insensitive evolution from an anisotropic phase to an isotropic phase. On the other hand, it is of great importance to construct a theory having extra dimensions as its intrinsic ingredients. We show that these two problems are closely related and can naturally be solved simultaneously in double field theory cosmology. Our derivations are based on general arguments without any fine-tuning parameters. In addition, We find that when we begin with FRW metric, the full spacetime metric of DFT <b>totally</b> <b>agrees</b> <b>with</b> Kaluza-Klein theory. There is a visible and invisible dimension exchange between the pre- and post-big bangs. Our results indicate that double field theory has profound physical consequences and the continuous O (D,D) is a very fundamental symmetry. This observation reinforces the viewpoint that symmetries dictate physics. 1 a...|$|R

It appears that bordellos could exist [...] "at the law's discretion" [...] (meaning the marshal's). As an historical matter, prior to the First World War, few laws criminalized prostitution in the United States. Miss Kitty was written out in 1974. The actress sought more free time and reportedly missed her late co-star, Glenn Strange, who played her Long Branch barkeep, Sam. When Blake decided not to return for the show's 20th (and final) season, the character was said to have returned to New Orleans. She was replaced by the hoarse-voiced, matronly actress Fran Ryan (known to many as the second Doris Ziffel on CBS' Green Acres).|$|R
