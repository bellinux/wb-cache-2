25|$|Desmoulea {{remained}} at Suda Bay for several weeks, {{down on the}} sandy bottom by the stern, with its after well deck awash; the cargo {{was transferred to the}} tanker Eocene. Along with the torpedo attack on the cargo ship Clan Cumming by the Italian submarine Neghelli on 19 January, this was the only Italian success against British convoys in the Aegean Sea. After the action, Allied shipping made passage into the Aegean through the Antikithera Strait. Desmoulea was finally taken in tow by the armed boarding vessel HMS Chakla and escorted to Port Said by the anti-submarine trawlers HMS Lydiard and HMS Amber. The ship arrived on 6 May and moored off the western beacon of Suez, for use as a temporary storage vessel. It was torpedoed again on 3 August 1941, while awaiting repairs, by German bombers. Desmoulea was towed to Bombay, India and ran aground twice during the passage. Desmoulea was converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>store</b> ship, named Empire Thane and remained in port at Cochin until 1947, from where it was towed back to the United Kingdom. It was rebuilt under its original name in 1949, before being laid up in 1955 and scrapped in 1961.|$|E

500|$|It had {{not been}} thought {{necessary}} to inscribe the word [...] "cents" [...] on the nickel; the silver and copper-nickel three-cent pieces had circulated for years with only a Roman numeral to indicate the denomination.

[...] They soon did so, and had success in passing the coin. Some coins were given a reeded edge by the fraudsters, to make them appear more like the gold coins. [...] A widespread tale {{is that one of the}} perpetrators of this fraud was a man named Josh Tatum, who would go <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>store,</b> select an item costing five cents or less, and offer the gold-plated piece in payment—and many clerks gave him $4.95 in change. [...] According to the tale, the law had no recourse against Tatum, as he had tendered the value of his purchase and had merely accepted the change as a gift. By some accounts, Tatum could not have misrepresented the value of the coin as he was a deaf-mute.|$|E

On one occasion, when a lady in waiting who usually picked up the girls from the hospital was detained and sent a carriage without an attendant, the two girls decided to go shopping in a store when they had a break. They ordered the carriage driver to stop in a shopping district and went <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>store</b> where they were not recognized because of their nursing uniforms. However, they discovered that they didn't know how to buy anything because they had never used money. The next day they asked Chebotareva how to go about purchasing an item from a store.

They had also been shopping with their Aunt, Olga Alexandrovna and Olga had visited shops on a trip to Germany with her sister Tatiana ...|$|E
500|$|... "Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge" [...] {{was written}} by Dana Gould and {{directed}} by Pete Michels. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 22, 2002. The idea for the episode was also pitched by Gould, who had just moved to southern California with his wife. After moving in, the two decided to install an alarm system because, Gould quipped, [...] "the police aren't enough. Too many people wanna kill you." [...] When meeting the other writers, Gould pitched an episode in which Homer becomes {{the owner of a}} security company, which then became [...] "Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge." [...] Although current showrunner Al Jean found it [...] "very funny," [...] the episode's first draft was heavily altered after the first table-read, a process in which the script is read out loud to the other writers. During the blackout, Lenny and Carl accidentally crash their cars <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>store,</b> causing a riot to erupt. The sequence was conceived by Gould who, after the 1992 Los Angeles riots, was [...] "somewhat obsessed" [...] with civil unrest issues. In the DVD commentary for the episode, he said [...] "I love the idea of, 'All you need is for the power to go out and slowly the fabric of society unravels." [...] While trying to determine who stole Lisa's Malibu Stacy car, Homer holds Bart as his prime suspect. Unbeknownst to Bart, who is eating an apple, Homer tells Lisa [...] "Look at him over there, eating that apple. What is he planning?" [...] Originally, the scene would show Homer suspecting Lisa, but because it bothered the character's voice actor, Yeardley Smith, the scene was changed. American actor Joe Mantegna reprises his role as Fat Tony in the episode.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} overwhelmingly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode {{a score of}} 9.5 out of 10, a series high alongside [...] "Chuck Versus the Colonel", Season 3's [...] "Chuck Versus the Beard" [...] and [...] "Chuck Versus the Subway", Season 4's [...] "Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger", and Season 5's [...] "Chuck Versus the Kept Man" [...] and [...] "Chuck Versus the Goodbye". Goldman described the episode as an [...] "especially strong installment, which delivered {{on a lot of}} fronts." [...] Goldman praised the scene depicting Sarah and Mauser's confrontation, writing, [...] "The entire ambience of the scene was terrific – a rainy night at a Christmas tree lot, with Chuck secretly watching as Sarah shot the unarmed, surrendering Mauser in cold blood - to the tune of 'Silent Night', no less. Of course she did this because she loves Chuck and wants to protect him, but all Chuck knows is that he just saw Sarah in a very scary light, and it's a great new dynamic to their relationship." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "Chuck vs. Santa Claus" [...] was moving along amusingly enough when it still seemed like Ned Rhyerson was just a hapless criminal with the bad luck to crash <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>store</b> built above a top-secret government intelligence facility, but the surprising left turn it took when Chuck flashed on Lt. Mauser took things to another level." [...] Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, writing [...] "Santa Claus certainly delivered (character) goodies to everyone tonight. Morgan gets to be a hero, even if no one notices, taking down Ned with a fake snow machine. Jeff calls his mother–in prison–then finds the time to break up a mistletoe makeout session. Lester sneaks a smooch from Anna, and isn't even remotely fazed when it causes her to run for the hills. And Big Mike's embrace of cousin Big Al is a keeper." ...|$|E

During the Byzantine Iconoclasm, the building was secularized and allegedly converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>store</b> of arms and manure. According to tradition, the bones of the saint were ordered thrown into the sea by Emperor Leo III the Isaurian (ruled 717–741) or by his son, Constantine V (r. 741–775).
