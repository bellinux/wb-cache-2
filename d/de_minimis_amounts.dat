Sec. 85 - 20 - 901) There is no {{separate}} Settlement Agreememt. The State Legislation ratifies {{settlement of}} Crow water rights. Includes 500, 000 a/f/y from Bighorn River, priority of May 7, 1868; 300, 000 a/f/y from Bighorn Lake storage but limited to half that amount during low periods. A stream and lake-level management {{plan to be}} developed for the Bighorn River. Tribe has surface, GW and storage rights within the Little Bighorn River, Pryor Creek, and Rosebud Creek (to the extent not interfering with Northern Cheyenne Tribal water rights); within Youngs Creek drainage, Squirrel Creek drainage, Tanner Creek drainage, Dry Creek drainage and Spring Creek drainage within Tongue River Basin; Sarpy Creek drainage within Yellowstone River Basin; Cottonwood Creek drainage, Five Mile Creek drainage and Bluewater Creek drainage within Clarks Fork Yellowstone River Basin; Sage Creek drainage within Shoshone River Basin; and Fly Creek drainage, Blue Creek drainage, Dry Creek drainage and Bitter Creek drainage within Yellowstone River Basin. Tribe {{has a right to}} 47, 000 a/f/y from the Ceded Strip provided that no more than 2, 500 a/f/y are from upstream of the Bighorn/Yellowstone Rivers confluence and no more than 7, 000 a/f/y is taken per month. Religious or cultural uses of water in <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> <b>amounts</b> shall be allowed without prior review. The Tribe shall develop a water code for the administration of the Tribal Water Right, and MT shall administer all state law rights. The Compact lays out procedures for assessing new water development requests. The Crow-MT Compact Board shall handle controversies and enforcement. MT will contribute $ 15 million over the course of 15 years beginning July 1, 1999 for benefit of Tribe. [Source: [URL]...|$|E

50|$|Under U.S. tax rules, the <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> rule {{governs the}} {{treatment}} of small amounts of market discount. Under the rule, if a bond is purchased {{with a small amount}} of market discount (an amount less than 0.25% of the face value of a bond times the number of complete years between the bond's acquisition date and its maturity date) the market discount is considered to be zero. If the market discount is less than the <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> <b>amount,</b> the discount on the bond is generally treated as a capital gain upon disposition or redemption rather than as ordinary income. Under Internal Revenue Service guidelines, the <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> rule can also apply to any benefit, property, or service provided to an employee that has so little value that reporting for it would be unreasonable or administratively impracticable; for example, use of a company photocopier to copy personal documents - see <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> fringe benefit. Cash is not excludable, regardless of the amount.|$|R
5000|$|A {{municipal}} bond, {{commonly known}} as a Muni Bond, is a bond issued by a local government or territory, or one of their agencies. It is generally used to finance public projects such as roads, schools, airports and seaports, and infrastructure-related repairs. The term municipal bond is commonly used in the United States, which has the largest market of such trade-able securities in the world. As of 2011, the municipal bond market was valued at $3.7 trillion. Potential issuers of municipal bonds include states, cities, counties, redevelopment agencies, special-purpose districts, school districts, public utility districts, publicly owned airports and seaports, and other governmental entities (or group of governments) at or below the state level having more than a <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> <b>amount</b> {{of one of the}} three sovereign powers: the power of taxation, the power of eminent domain or the police power.|$|R

While there are some statutory exemptions under this rule for <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> fringe <b>amounts,</b> and for achievement awards, the general rule is the employee must report a “gift” from the employer as income for Federal income tax purposes.

40|$|The {{neonatal}} Fc receptor (FcRn) regulates IgG and albumin homeostasis, mediates maternal IgG transport, {{is active}} in phagocytosis and delivers antigen for presentation. We have previously shown that transgenic (tg) mice that have been created to overexpress bovine FcRn (bFcRn) demonstrate increased half-life of mouse IgG, significantly increased antigen-specific IgG in serum and augmented expansion of antigen-specific B cells and plasma cells after immunization. One of the interesting questions surrounding this enhanced immune response is whether these tg mice could effectively induce immune response to weakly immunogenic antigens. To address this question, we immunized these bFcRn tg mice with a conserved hemagglutinin subunit 2 (HA 2) -based synthetic peptide that was recently found to be effectively targeted by neutralizing antibodies. Using an ELISA system, we found that, whereas wild-type mice showed a weak immune response and developed only a <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> <b>amount</b> of antibody against the epitope, FcRn overexpressing animals mounted a robust reaction expressed in specific antibody titers on day 28 that continued to rise through day 50. Consistent with our previous data, the enhanced immune response resulting from the FcRn overexpression was also associated with {{a substantial increase in}} the number of spleen derived B cells, dendritic cells, granulocytes and plasma cells. Based on this evidence, we propose that tg mice that overexpress bFcRn offer major advantages in monoclonal antibody production because the tg mice would allow the generation of antibodies (hybridomas) to weakly immunogenic antigens that otherwise would be difficult or even impossible to make...|$|R
40|$|In Pilgrim’s Pride Corp. v. Commissioner, the Fifth Circuit {{reversed}} the Tax Court and {{held that the}} taxpayer was entitled to an ordinary loss deduction from its abandonment of securities. While the conclusion reached by the Fifth Circuit has been overshadowed by the promulgation of Treasury Regulation section 1. 165 - 5 (i) that effectively treats an abandoned security as worthless and thus characterizes the loss as capital, the case remains noteworthy because it provides an opportunity to examine the statutory interpretation of two distinct Internal Revenue Code sections, section 165 (g) (1) and section 1234 A. The article focuses on what methods of statutory construction should have been utilized to determine the application of these sections to the Pilgrim’s Pride fact-pattern. Ordinary loss treatment for an abandoned security seems conceptually incorrect when both a worthless security and a sale of the security for a <b>de</b> <b>minimis</b> <b>amount</b> would generally result in a capital loss. The article analyzes whether, and if so, under what theory did the courts deciding Pilgrim’s Pride possess the statutory authority to treat the abandonment as a capital loss. Furthermore, assuming the courts had such authority, the article considers whether it was proper to do so under the particular factual circumstances surrounding this case. There {{are a variety of}} statutory construction methodologies each with erudite proponents making very persuasive contentions. Applying an Internal Revenue Code section to a particular fact-pattern, however, it can often be wiser not to be wedded to one approach, e. g., textualism. Instead, it is submitted that employing disparate methodologies depending on the particular circumstances may be sounder. Pilgrim’s Pride provides a focal point for examining statutory interpretation methodologies and illustrating the foregoing. As such, reflecting on the case has continuing relevance despite the widespread application of Treasury Regulation section 1. 165 - 5 (i) to the abandonment of securities. As demonstrated by the different approaches that I believe were proper here for considering the applicability of sections 165 (g) (1) and 1234 A to Pilgrim’s Pride, distinct circumstances require discrete approaches to applying a statutory provision to a case. Our democratic institutions are not put at risk, by foregoing dogmatic textualism where this would lead to a result wherein “no conceivable tax policy... supports this interpretation” or deeming, in the case of section 165 (g) (1), an abandoned security to be per se worthless. Restraint, however, from deviating from the clear language of the text, such as applying section 1234 A to inherent rights, may be in order where there are no overriding reasons not to do so...|$|R

40|$|<b>De</b> <b>minimis</b> cutoffs are a {{familiar}} feature of risk regulation.
