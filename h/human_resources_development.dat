40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Human</b> <b>resource</b> <b>development</b> {{requires}} {{the provision of}} basic necessities {{of life for the}} existence and survival at grass root levels.

40|$|Purpose – To {{explore and}} {{describe}} the roles, activities and strategies of French <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> <b>development</b> professionals. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is based primarily on exploratory and descriptive research. A range of secondary sources on European and French <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> <b>development</b> is critically reviewed to generate a number of research questions designed to identify the corporate perspective on <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> <b>development</b> by means of cases drawn from six organizations located in Eastern France. Findings – These confirm {{the lack of a}} clear understanding of <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> <b>development</b> on the part of French companies; the wide range of activities that is considered to fall within <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> development; an emerging interest in management development, career development and skills forecasting, but a neglect of training evaluation; the similarity of <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> <b>development</b> practitioner roles to those elsewhere in Europe; growing evidence of the involvement of line managers in <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> <b>development</b> activity, and a strong commitment to the strategic significance of <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> <b>development.</b> Research limitations/implications – The study was based on an opportunity sample of just six companies in Eastern France, and may therefore not be representative, but it does provide findings that expand upon and also qualify earlier research. Practical implications – This study provides new knowledge and understanding of the context and practice of <b>human</b> <b>resource</b> <b>development</b> in France and makes a number of suggestions for further research.
