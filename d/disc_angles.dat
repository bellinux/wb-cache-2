5000|$|A Flashflight is {{a flying}} disc {{designed}} {{to be used for}} night-time disc games between two or more individuals. The Flashflight differs from traditional discs (including glow-in-the-dark models also intended for nocturnal usage) in that it has a completely enclosed single ultra-high brightness LED and fiber optics designed to distribute light {{from the center of the}} disc to the outer rim. The red light (630 nm wavelength) does not interfere with human night vision, and is visible from all <b>disc</b> <b>angles</b> because all disc surfaces are illuminated [...] - [...] the top deck glows, there is a radiant array on the concave underside, and there are nine bright dots on the perimeter of the rim. Designed in 2002 by University of Colorado at Boulder alumni Jeff Scott and Jerry Moore, the Flashflight (a trademarked brand name) is manufactured via injection molding, using a soft polyethylene. A standard lithium coin-cell battery (CR2430 3 volt or DL2430 3 v) powers the 185-gram, 10.75 in disc.|$|E
40|$|Knowledge about {{segmental}} {{flexibility in}} adolescent idiopathic scoliosis {{is crucial for}} a better biomechanical understanding, particularly {{for the development of}} fusionless, growth-guiding techniques. Currently, there is lack of data in this field. The objective of this study was, therefore, to compute segmental flexibility indices (standing angle minus corrected angle/standing angle). We compared segmental <b>disc</b> <b>angles</b> in 76 preoperative sets of standing and fulcrum-bending radiographs of thoracic curves (paired, two-tailed t tests, p < 0. 05). The mean standing Cobb angle was 59. 7 degrees (range 41. 3 degrees - 95 degrees) and the flexibility index of the curve was 48. 6 % (range 16. 6 - 78. 8 %). The <b>disc</b> <b>angles</b> showed symmetric periapical distribution with significant decrease (all p values < 0. 0001) for every cephalad (+) and caudad (-) level change. The periapical levels + 1 and - 1 wedged at 8. 3 degrees and 8. 7 degrees (range 3. 5 degrees - 14. 8 degrees), respectively. All angles were significantly smaller on the-bending views (p values < 0. 0001). We noted mean periapical flexibility indices of 46 % (+ 1), 49 % (- 1), 57 % (+ 2) and 81 % (- 2), which were significantly less (p < 0. 001) than for the group of remote levels 105 % (+ 3), 149 % (- 3), 231 % (+ 4) and 300 % (- 4). The discal and bony wedging was 60 and 40 %, respectively, and mean values 35 degrees and 24 degrees (p < 0. 0001). Their relationship with the Cobb angle showed a moderate correlation (r = 0. 56 and 0. 45). Functional, radiographic analysis of idiopathic thoracic scoliosis revealed significant, homogenous segmental tethering confined to four periapical levels. Future research will aim at in vivo segmental measurements in three planes under defined load to provide in-depth data for novel therapeutic strategies...|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to predict postoperative radiographic curve magnitude and balance parameters while performing intraoperative correction during scoliosis surgery.

We retrospectively reviewed 44 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis who underwent posterior instrumentation with pedicle screws. We made preoperative, intraoperative (after instrumentation and correction), and standing postoperative radiographic measurements (eg, curve magnitudes, coronal and sagittal balance, <b>disc</b> <b>angles)</b> and compared those for the intra- and postoperative radiographs. The intraoperative long-cassette scoliosis film correlated with the immediate postoperative standing film for all curve correction and balance parameters.

40|$|Study design In a {{radiographic}} study, postoperative segmental alignment {{was compared}} between two cohorts of 20 consecutive patients operated with a Bryan Cervical Disc Prosthesis. In group II, patients with severe preoperative kyphosis were excluded for disc replacement surgery and the surgical technique was slightly altered {{in order to}} avoid asymmetric overdrilling of the posterior part of the cranial endplate of the caudal vertebral body. Objective The aim was to investigate whether this change in patient inclusion criteria and this modification of the surgical technique had an influence on postoperative segmental alignment, and whether postoperative kyphosis is related to the mechanical properties and/or the design of the prosthesis. Summary of Background data Several research groups reported segmental kyphosis after treatment of degenerative disc disease with the Bryan Cervical Disc Prosthesis. Methods Based on lateral radiographs, the <b>disc</b> insertion <b>angle</b> (as a postoperative estimate for the intraoperative angle of approach), and the angle of the functional spinal unit and <b>disc</b> <b>angle</b> (both as measures for segmental alignment) were calculated. Results In group I, 80 % of the patients had a kyphotic FSU angle and 40 % had a kyphotic <b>disc</b> <b>angle</b> preoperatively. At follow-up, 65 % of the patients had a kyphotic FSU angle while 55 % had a kyphotic <b>disc</b> <b>angle.</b> In group II, 40 % of the patients had a kyphotic FSU angle and 5 % had a kyphotic <b>disc</b> <b>angle</b> preoperatively. At follow-up, 40 % of the patients had a kyphotic FSU angle while 5 % had a kyphotic <b>disc</b> <b>angle.</b> Due to the change in patient inclusion criteria, {{there was a significant difference}} in preoperative FSU angle between group I and group II; however no significant difference in preoperative <b>disc</b> <b>angle</b> was found. Due to the change in surgical technique, the <b>disc</b> insertion <b>angle</b> was significant different between both groups. A difference in postoperative FSU angle, however nonsignificant, between both groups was observed. There was a significant difference in postoperative <b>disc</b> <b>angle</b> between both groups; group I showed significantly more kyphosis of the shells than group II. Conclusions This study shows that segmental malalignment with the Bryan Disc can be reduced and is therefore not device related. Proper patient selection and a modified surgical technique can prevent this adverse outcome. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{clinical}} {{measurement of}} spinal {{range of motion}} (ROM) is essential {{in the evaluation of}} artificial disc performance. The effect of patient placement with respect to the X-ray beam source is yet to be reported and may be an influencing factor in radiographic artificial <b>disc</b> <b>angle</b> measurements. This study aims to evaluate how radiographic patient placement influences artificial <b>disc</b> <b>angle</b> measurements. An anatomically accurate synthetic L 4 –L 5 motion segment was instrumented with an artificial disc and two pins. The instrumented motion segment was mounted onto a frame allowing for independent rotation and elevation while holding the artificial <b>disc</b> <b>angle</b> and anatomical position between L 4 and L 5 fixed. Analyses included descriptive statistics, evaluation of uncertainty, intra- and inter-observer, and a 2 -way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The mean angle measurement range at the various positions was 1. 26 ° for the pin, and 2. 74 ° for the artificial disc endplates. The centered patient position had the highest inter- and intra-observer reliability. ANOVA results showed elevation effects to be statistically significant (P =  0. 021), and rotational effects to be extremely statistically significant (P <  0. 0001) for the pin angles. In terms of the mean artificial <b>disc</b> <b>angle,</b> however, the ANOVA showed a highly statistically significant interaction term (P =  0. 002). A significant difference was found in the angle measurements of a fixed artificial disc prosthesis based on a sample of patient radiographic placement positions. Since it is important to assess the success of an artificial disc replacement by evaluating the relatively small ROM present, it is crucial to aim at minimizing the error by placing the patient parallel to the plate with the beam centered not at the mid lumbar spine, but {{at the level of the}} arthroplasty, for both flexion and extension views...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} is to evaluate the geometric parameters of vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs in spinal segments adjacent to spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis. This pilot cross-sectional study was an ancillary project to the Framingham Heart Study. The presence of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis as well as measurements of spinal geometry were identified on CT imaging of 188 individuals. Spinal geometry measurements included lordosis angle, wedging of each lumbar vertebra and intervertebral disc. Last measurements were used to calculate ΣB, {{the sum of the}} lumbar L 1 –L 5 body wedge angles; and ΣD, the sum of the lumbar L 1 –L 5 intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>angles.</b> Using Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test we compared the geometric parameters between individuals with no pathology and ones with spondylolysis (with no listhesis) at L 5 vertebra, ones with isthmic spondylolisthesis at L 5 –S 1 level, and ones with degenerative spondylolisthesis at L 5 –S 1 level. Spinal geometry in individuals with spondylolysis or listhesis at L 5 shows three major patterns: In spondylolysis without listhesis, spinal morphology {{is similar to that of}} healthy individuals; In isthmic spondylolisthesis there is high lordosis angle, high L 5 vertebral body wedging and very high L 4 – 5 disc wedging; In degenerative spondylolisthesis, spinal morphology shows more lordotic wedging of the L 5 vertebral body, and less lordotic wedging of intervertebral discs. In conclusion, there are unique geometrical features of the vertebrae and discs in spondylolysis or listhesis. These findings need to be reproduced in larger scale study...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the effects of physiological loading on the lumbar spine in national male players of different games, which may be predictive of the future development of low back pain and injury symptoms. Thirty-four national players (12 cricket players, 12 field hockey players, and 10 basketball players) underwent magnetic resonance imaging, and selected geometric variables including intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>angles,</b> the Farfan ratio, the lumbar body index, the compression deformity ratio, the biconcave deformity ratio and the anterior wedge deformity ratio were measured using KINOVEA- 0. 8. 15 software and syngo fast view software and calculated using specific formulas. The results indicated a significant difference in the intervertebral disc angle between the three groups at the L 2 / 3, L 3 / 4 and L 4 / 5 levels. In relation to the lumbar vertebral body shape and size, significant differences were found in the lumbar index at the L 2 level, in the biconcave deformity at the L 1 and L 2 levels and in relation to the anterior wedge deformity at L 2 between the three selected groups. Our data suggest that the different physiological loadings in the selected sports play an important role in the development of degenerative changes of the lumbar spine, which may be considered a risk factor for future injury and/or low back pain in each specific sport because of the unique demands of each discipline...|$|E

In this study, {{our aim was to}} examine differences in interocular and intraocular macular thickness, interocular fovea-optic <b>disc</b> <b>angle,</b> and foveal blood vessel asymmetries associated with sighting ocular dominance. Ninety eyes of 45 healthy young adults were included in this prospective, cross-sectional, and comparative study. Sighting ocular dominance was determined by a hole-in-the-card test. Macular thickness measurements were taken and posterior pole asymmetry analysis conducted with spectral domain optical coherence tomography. The optic disc–fovea angle and visible foveal blood vessel counts were calculated by using the posterior pole retinal images of optical coherence tomography. The mean age of the participants was 27. 3 (standard deviation [SD] 6. 6) years. There were 20 males and 25 females. The mean total macular area thickness, and mean macular thickness of the superior and inferior hemispheres of the dominant and nondominant eyes were similar (p >  0. 05). Macular asymmetry analysis revealed no statistically significant interocular difference (p >  0. 05). In the dominant eyes, the mean optic disc–fovea angle was 5. 24 ° (SD 1. 77), whereas it was 5. 49 ° (SD 2. 58) in the nondominant eyes (p =  0. 51). The number of visible blood vessels passing through the fovea was similar in the dominant and nondominant eyes (p >  0. 05).

40|$|Modified {{design of}} a planter to be {{attached}} to a mobile robot, was the main objective of this project. This research project {{was part of a}} larger project, called “Developing robotics assisted technology for farming”. The main motivation for this research project is the fact that mobile robot, is an electric powered vehicle with limited power and pulling force. Thus, a customized planter with a customized connection mechanism should be designed. Besides, it should require less draft force compared to existing planters so that it can be pulled by the mobile robot. The developed planter should have the same efficiency as the existing planters in seeding. To find the forces between soil engagement tool (disc coulter) and soil, experiments were designed and performed in the Linear Soil Bin at University of Saskatchewan. <b>Disc</b> and tilt <b>angle</b> of a <b>disc</b> coulter was changed and draft, vertical and side forces applied to it were measured to find the <b>disc</b> and tilt <b>angle</b> combinations that results in minimum draft force. Experiments showed that 7 ° <b>disc</b> <b>angle</b> and 25 ° tilt angle provides the least draft force compared to other <b>disc</b> <b>angle</b> and tilt angle combinations. Then, using the knowledge obtained from literature and the soil bin experiments, a planter was designed conceptually and in detail, based on the existing CNH planter. For further analyses computer modeling was performed. The whole planter was modeled in 3 D, using SolidWorks. Stress analysis was performed in ANSYS Workbench to calculate safety factor of the designed parts. Two prototypes were fabricated and were attached to the mobile robot for field tests. Tests were performed in indoor settings to measure the total draft force required to pull developed planters. Draft force was very close to the value that was calculated in design stage. Results showed that an average of 460 N pulling force is required to pull one row planter for 50 mm depth of cut, which can be compared to n existing CNH corn planter that requires a pulling force of between 900 N to 1300 N. Seed drop accuracy and function of the developed planters in opening and closing a packed soil in presence of residue, were also observed in outdoor tests...|$|R

Objective. To determine the clinical and radiological outcomes of MIS-TLIF for treatment of single-level spinal stenosis low-grade isthmic or degenerative spondylolisthesis at L 5 -S 1. Methods. Radiological data and electronic medical records of patients who underwent MIS-TLIF between May 2012 and December 2014 were reviewed. Fusion rate, cage position, disc height (DH), <b>disc</b> <b>angle</b> (DA), <b>disc</b> slope <b>angle,</b> segmental lordotic angle (SLA), lumbar lordotic angle (LLA), and pelvic parameters were assessed. For functional assessment, the visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI), and patient satisfaction rate (PSR) were utilized. Results.

40|$|A {{prediction}} model based upon Mohr-Coulomb soil mechanics {{theory has been}} developed to predict {{the interaction between the}} soil and agricultural discs of different geometries and operating angles to both vertical and tilted discs. The model is based on two forms of soil failure. The magnitude of each form of failure is depen- dent upon a passive reaction on the concave side of the disc and a vertical bearing reaction on the convex side of the disc. The predicted results are in close agreement with the results of the experimental studies. Disc geometry {{is one of the most}} important factors to be considered in evaluating the soil reaction acting upon a disc tool. A theoretical analysis of the disc geometry was therefore carried out. The analysis of the disc geometry makes it possible to determine the factors required for the predicted forces acting on a disc tool. The experimental studies were conducted in a sandy loam soil at a moisture content in the friable range, under controlled soil bin conditions. The work was carried out at full-scale with 3 dimensional force measuring apparatus developed primarily for this investigation. The discs studied had a range of <b>disc</b> <b>angles</b> between 150 and 600 and a range of tilt angles between 0 and 35. The depth of cut ranged from 80 mm to 140 mm and at speeds between 0. 75 m/s and 1. 5 m/s. The disturbance area of the soil caused by the rotating soil cutting disc is calculated to define the disturbed area for any combination of disc angle, disc diameter, gang spacing and depth of work in order to accurately calculate specific resistance.

Roll control is by differential collective pitch change on the left and right rotors, ensuring that sufficient lift is generated to prevent inadvertent sink. Yaw in the hover or low air speeds is achieved by tilting the rotor discs forward and backward deferentially depending on direction of yaw required. At higher air speeds differential rotor control is gradually supplanted by the large aerodynamic rudder on the fin.

This study enrolled 113 eyes of 113 OAG patients (mean age: 62. 5 ± 12. 6; Humphrey field analyzer-measured mean deviation: - 9. 4 ± 7. 3 dB). Newly developed software was used to quantify a total of 20 optic disc parameters in SS-OCT (DRI OCT- 1, TOPCON) images of the optic disc. The most suitable reference plane (RP) above the plane of Bruch's membrane opening was determined by comparing, at various RP heights, the SS-OCT-measured rim parameters and spectral-domain OCT-measured circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (cpRNFLT), with Pearson's correlation analysis. To obtain a discriminant formula for disc type classification, a training group of 72 eyes of 72 OAG patients and a validation group of 60 eyes of 60 OAG patients were set up. Correlation with cpRNFLT differed with disc type and RP height, but overall, a height of 120 μm minimized the influence of disc type.

In recent years, the optimization of design of the multi-plunger pump to reduce the pulsation of output pressure is an urgent problem to be solved. In the present study, the flow pulsation and frequency characteristics of multi-plunger canted disc link pump were simulated based on the kinematical equations. The kinetic characteristics of this type of pump were expounded through the calculation results. The effects of plunger number, canted <b>disc</b> dip <b>angle,</b> rotate speed, diameter and location of ball socket reference circle on the flow pulsation and frequency characteristic of the pump were also studied...|$|R

In the crystal, the mol­ecules are linked by four hydrogen bonds, one classical (N—H⋯N) and three ‘weak’ (C—H⋯O), forming layers parallel to the ac plane; these are in turn linked in the third dimension by Cl⋯N [3. 1689  (16)  Å] and Cl⋯O [3. 3148  (13)  Å] contacts to the heterocyclic ring...|$|R
40|$|Objective: In Korea, direct lateral interbody fusion (DLIF) {{was started}} since 2011, using {{standard}} cage (6 ° lordotic angle, 18 mm width). Recently, a new wider cage with higher lordotic angle (12 °, 22 mm) was introduced. The aim {{of our study}} is to compare the clinical and radiologic outcomes of the two cage types. Methods: We selected patients underwent DLIF, 125 cases used standard cages (standard group) and 38 cases used new cages (wide group). We followed them up for more than 6 months, and their radiological and clinical outcomes were analyzed retrospectively. For radiologic outcomes, lumbar lordotic angle (LLA), segmental lordoic <b>angle</b> (SLA), <b>disc</b> <b>angle</b> (DA), foraminal height change (FH), subsidence and intraoperative endplate destruction (iED) were checked. Clinical outcomes were compared using visual analog scale (VAS) score, Oswestry disability index (ODI) score and complications. Results: LLA and SLA showed no significant changes postoperatively in both groups. DA showed significant increase after surgery in the wide group (p< 0. 05), {{but not in the}} standard group. Subsidence was significantly lower in the wide group (p< 0. 05). There was no difference in clinical outcomes between the two groups. Additional posterior decompression was done more frequently in the wide group. Postoperative change of foraminal height was significantly lower in the wide group (p< 0. 05). The iED was observed more frequently in the wide group (p< 0. 05) especially at the anterior edge of cage. Conclusion: The new type of cage seems to result in more DA and less subsidence. But indirect foraminal decompression seems to be less effective than standard cage. Intraoperative endplate destruction occurs more frequently due to a steepe...|$|R

However, the association between obesity and low back pain remains controversial. Little is known about the effects of overweight and obesity on the angles of the lumbosacral spine. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of body mass index (BMI) and waist–hip ratio (WHR) on lumbosacral angles. Methods: The effects of BMI and WHR on the lumbar lordosis angle (LLA), lumbosacral angle (LSA), sacral inclination angle (°°), and lumbosacral <b>disc</b> <b>angle</b> (LSDA) of 174 overweight and obese subjects (test group) and 126 underweight and normal-weight subjects (control group) were analyzed. Results: The test group had a significantly higher mean LSA, LLA, sacral inclination angle (SIA), and LSDA (P= 0. 001). A significant correlation was noted between BMI and LSA (P= 0. 001), LLA (P= 0. 001), SIA (P= 0. 001), and LSDA (P= 0. 03). There was also a positive relationship between WHR and LSA (P= 0. 012), LLA (P= 0. 009), SIA (P= 0. 02), and LSDA (P= 0. 01). Conclusion: There was an increase in lumbosacral angles in individuals with raised BMI and WHR. This may result in biomechanical changes in the lumbosacral spine, which increase the incidence of low back pain. Keywords: body mass index, waist–hip ratio, lumbosacral angle...|$|R
40|$|Inner {{accretion}} disc {{around a}} black hole provides a rare, natural probe to understand the fundamental physics of the strong gravity regime. A possible tilt of such a disc, {{with respect to the}} black hole spin equator, is important. This is because such a tilt affects the observed spectral and timing properties of the disc X-ray emission via Lense-Thirring precession, which could be used to test the theoretical predictions regarding the strong gravity. Here, we analytically solve the steady, warped accretion disc equation of Scheurer and Feiler (1996), and find an expression of the radial profile of the <b>disc</b> tilt <b>angle.</b> In our exact solution, considering a prograde disc around a slowly spinning black hole, we include the inner part of the disc, which was not done earlier in this formalism. Such a solution is timely, as a tilted inner disc has recently been inferred from X-ray spectral and timing features of the accreting black hole H 1743 - 322. Our tilt angle radial profile expression includes observationally measurable parameters, such as black hole mass and Kerr parameter, and the disc inner edge tilt angle W_ in, and hence can be ideal to confront observations. Our solution shows that the <b>disc</b> tilt <b>angle</b> in 10 - 100 gravitational radii is a significant fraction of the disc outer edge tilt angle, even for W_ in = 0. Moreover, tilt angle radial profiles have humps in ∼ 10 - 1000 gravitational radii for some sets of parameter values, which should have implications for observed X-ray features.

40|$|Background - Segmental {{biomechanics}} of the scoliotic spine {{are important}} since the overall spinal deformity {{is comprised of}} the cumulative coronal and axial rotations of individual joints. This study investigates the coronal plane segmental biomechanics for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients in response to physiologically relevant axial compression. Methods - Individual spinal joint compliance in the coronal plane was measured {{for a series of}} 15 idiopathic scoliosis patients using axially loaded magnetic resonance imaging. Each patient was first imaged in the supine position with no axial load, and then again following application of an axial compressive load. Coronal plane <b>disc</b> wedge <b>angles</b> in the unloaded and loaded configurations were measured. Joint moments exerted by the axial compressive load were used to derive estimates of individual joint compliance. Findings - The mean standing major Cobb angle for this patient series was 46 °. Mean intra-observer measurement error for endplate inclination was 1. 6 °. Following loading, initially highly wedged discs demonstrated a smaller change in wedge angle, than less wedged discs for certain spinal levels (+ 2,+ 1,− 2 relative to the apex, (p < 0. 05)). Highly wedged discs were observed near the apex of the curve, which corresponded to lower joint compliance in the apical region. Interpretation - While individual patients exhibit substantial variability in <b>disc</b> wedge <b>angles</b> and joint compliance, overall there is a pattern of increased disc wedging near the curve apex, and reduced joint compliance in this region. Approaches such as this can provide valuable biomechanical data on in vivo spinal biomechanics of the scoliotic spine, for analysis of deformity progression and surgical planning...|$|R
