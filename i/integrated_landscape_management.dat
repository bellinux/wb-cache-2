2500|$|Landscape ecology {{has been}} {{incorporated}} {{into a variety of}} ecological subdisciplines. For example, a recent development has been the more explicit consideration of spatial concepts and principles applied to the study of lakes, streams, and wetlands in the field of landscape limnology. In addition, landscape ecology has important links to application-oriented disciplines such as agriculture and forestry. [...] In agriculture, landscape ecology has introduced new options for the management of environmental threats brought about by the intensification of agricultural practices. [...] Agriculture has always been a strong human impact on ecosystems. [...] In forestry, from structuring stands for fuelwood and timber to ordering stands across landscapes to enhance aesthetics, consumer needs have affected conservation and use of forested landscapes. [...] Landscape forestry provides methods, concepts, and analytic procedures for landscape forestry. Landscape ecology has been cited as a contributor to the development of fisheries biology as a distinct biological science discipline, and is frequently incorporated in study design for wetland delineation in hydrology. It has helped shape <b>integrated</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>management.</b> [...] Lastly, landscape ecology has been very influential for progressing sustainability science and sustainable development planning. [...] In example, a recent study assessed sustainable urbanization across Europe using evaluation indices, country-landscapes, and landscape ecology tools and methods.|$|E

This study explores this at a localised scale. Examining the value of an ecosystems services perspective, it focuses on two case-study landscapes in Gloucestershire. Using interviews, focus groups, mapping tasks and questionnaires it examines how stakeholder values intersect with current policies and practices. Based on this analysis, it suggests the need for greater integration and knowledge exchange between stakeholders to ensure the sustainability of <b>landscape</b> <b>management.</b> It suggests new strategies, such as a centralised e-portal of resources, are required to ensure awareness and dialogue between stakeholders.

40|$|The {{differentiation}} of vegetation and flora {{of the upper}} Płonia R. valley in Western Pomerania was discussed in relation to distribution of components of natural environment. Causes of landscape transformation and direct types of human impact on vegetation were analysed. The obtained results have shown trends in {{the transformation of the}} valley's landscape, which can be summarised as a continuous change from anthropogenic agricultural landscape to a more natural one. It was concluded, that uncontrolled continuation of the recorded processes will lead, among others, to the decrease in biodiversity. For that reason a proposal for <b>integrated</b> <b>landscape</b> and nature <b>management</b> has been elaborated. It combines classical methods of protection (establishment of protected areas) with administrative and managerial measures, such as active management of biotopes outside the reserves and co-operation with non-profit organisations, in achieving protection goals at the scale of the whole landscape...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} regime {{complexity}} in global environmental governance is widely recognized. The academic debate on regime fragmentation has itself however been rather fragmented, with discussions circling around different concepts, including inter-organizational relations, polycentric governance, <b>integrated</b> <b>management,</b> <b>landscape</b> governance, environmental policy integration, coordination, mainstreaming, coherence, policy mixes, governance architectures and systems, regime complexes, institutional interaction, metagovernance and the nexus approach. Moreover, {{the topic of}} relationships between different policies is also discussed among practitioners, where the call for synergies is increasingly heard. This article brings together these discussions under the common heading of integrative environmental governance (IEG). The article provides a literature review, and argues for an IEG perspective in which the relationships between governance instruments take center stage...|$|R

40|$|Areawide {{management}} {{has a long}} history of achieving solutions that target pests, however, there has been little focus on the areawide management of arthropod natural enemies. Landscape ecology studies that show a positive relationship between natural enemy abundance and habitat diversity demonstrate landscape-dependent pest suppression, but have not yet clearly linked their findings to pest management or to the suite of pests associated with crops that require control. Instead the focus has often been on model systems of single pest species and their natural enemies. We suggest that management actions to capture pest control from natural enemies may be forth coming if: (i) the suite of response and predictor variables focus on pest complexes and specific management actions; (ii) the contribution of "the landscape" is identified by assessing the timing and numbers of natural enemies immigrating and emigrating to and from the target crop, as well as pests; and (iii) pest control thresholds aligned with crop development stages are the benchmark to measure impact of natural enemies on pests, in turn allowing for comparison between study regions, and generalizations. To achieve pest control we will need to incorporate what has been learned from an ecological understanding of model pest and natural enemy systems and <b>integrate</b> areawide <b>landscape</b> <b>management</b> with in-field pest management...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{studying}} the potentials of cultural heritage in the discourse of development in rural cultural landscapes. It studies the attributes of the <b>integrated</b> cultural <b>landscape</b> <b>management</b> {{in order to maintain}} sustainability of the cultural landscape as a holistic system of entangled cultural and natural elements. This management approach is investigated through participative activities as well as considering cultural heritage as a resource for local sustainable development in all dimensions. While going through chronological review of policy documents in the area of sustainable development and cultural integration, academic literature review was made to come up with defining the interfaces of valorization of cultural heritage and the dimensions of sustainable development. The relevant challenges regarding the rural cultural landscapes were studied through a questionnaire survey {{in the case of a}} World Heritage Site in Iran, namely Throne of Solomon (Takht-e Soleyman). The findings of the empirical research show that the area is suffering from the lack of symmetrical exploitation of the resources not adequately resulting in economic development, environmental protection and social cohesion. On the other hand, at local level there is a positive trend for the participative activities for valorization of cultural heritage as a potential resource for development which acknowledges global recognition of culture as the forth pillar of sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|Landscapes {{are linked}} to human {{well-being}} in a multitude of ways, {{some of which are}} challenged by global market forces and traditional management approaches. In response to this situation there has been a rise in local initiatives to sustain the values of landscape. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a systematic analysis of the spectrum of these initiatives in Europe in terms of patterns of organisation, participants, resources, problems, and landscape values addressed. This review collects examples of <b>integrated</b> <b>landscape</b> initiatives from all over Europe through systematic internet key word searches and canvassing of European umbrella organisations; followed by an online survey of representatives from the identified initiatives (n = 71). Our results show that the most relevant characteristics of <b>integrated</b> <b>landscape</b> initiatives in Europe are: a holistic approach to <b>landscape</b> <b>management</b> (acting in multifunctional landscapes and combining different objectives), the involvement and coordination of different sectors and stakeholders at many levels, and the role as agents of awareness raising and learning hubs. <b>Integrated</b> <b>landscape</b> initiatives mainly depend on impulses of local civil society.

50|$|In {{terms of}} climate change and REDD+, unlike other sectors that emit {{greenhouse}} gases, the land use sector (including agriculture and forestry) {{has the potential to}} mitigate climate change by actively removing greenhouse gases, in addition to simply reducing emissions, especially through reforestation and landscape restoration. This sector accounts for around 24% of anthropogenic emisisons - and a much greater proportion of emissions in many developing countries, where land use represents the largest potential for climate change mitigation. There are many interactions between climate change and agriculture so the case for <b>integrated</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>management</b> is again based on the need for landscape managers to consider multiple issues and achieve multiple objectives simultaneously (i.e. production of food and climate mitigation). Advocates of <b>integrated</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>management</b> argue that 'climate-smart agriculture' and implementation of the Cancun REDD+ safeguards can draw on integrated landscape management; for instance, multi-stakeholder planning, appropriate landscape governance and resource tenure, investment in the landscape, and monitoring social and climate goals at different scales.|$|E
50|$|<b>Integrated</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>management</b> is one {{approach}} to addressing the major global challenges of poverty, food security, climate change, water scarcity, deforestation {{and loss of}} biodiversity at the local level. Proponents of <b>integrated</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>management</b> argue that as these challenges are interconnected, coordinated approaches are needed to address them, in order for landscapes (heterogenous geographic areas) to generate multiple benefits. For example, one river basin can supply water for towns and agriculture, timber and food crops for smallholders and industry, and habitat for biodiversity; {{the way in which}} each one of these sectors pursues its goals can have impacts on the others. The integrated approach goes beyond traditional sector-based practices that manage these different land uses independently of each other, even where they depend on the same resource base. The intention is to manage landscapes in a joined-up way, so that society's needs can be met in the short term, and in the long term.|$|E

40|$|In {{a modern}} world that seems {{sometimes}} too much threatened by oppositions of people, cultures and continents, cultural heritage could reconnect and inspire people by exploring and defining a dynamic and richly varied past that could {{act as a}} base for a common future. Therefore, landscape stewardship needs a thorough knowledge of past landscapes and a never ending redefinition of our common cultural heritage. The chapter examines how the knowledge of the past and the care for cultural heritage can be integrated into an innovative strategy for landscape stewardship. Key concepts are interdisciplinarity, intersectorality and participation. First an interdisciplinary method is described which allows very diverse types of cultural historical information to be integrated into one effective and widely accessible landscape biography. We then examine how local experiential knowledge and scientific expertise can be amalgamated and translated into a participatory planning process. Finally, we focus on the landscape itself: how can heritage and nature management be merged into a more <b>integrated</b> form of <b>landscape</b> <b>management.</b> And how can new collective arrangements of citizens contribute to innovative forms of landscape stewardship on local and micro-regional levels...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{implementation}} of governance for sustainable landscapes, based on a catchment case study in lowland England. A participatory research process, spanning {{six and a half}} years, employed formal and informal in-depth interviews, focus group work and workshop techniques with 71 stakeholders representative {{of a wide range of}} interests in the catchment. A scenario design process within a GIS framework was used as a focus for capturing the key issues and visions of the stakeholders. Two contrasting but plausible scenarios for 2020 emerged from this process; one scenario was driven by the sustainable intensification of agricultural production and world trade, the other by the enhanced protection of ecosystem services and multi-objective land use. It was clear from discussions with stakeholders that the mechanisms for delivering an <b>integrated</b> approach to <b>landscape</b> <b>management</b> are not currently in place, although there have been some policy successes that could be built upon. There is also a need for new approaches to land tenure which include tax incentives and improved forms of cooperation and leadership in both policy and contiguous landscape stewardship. The methodology itself was appreciated by the stakeholders who found it useful to think more holistically. In addition, the study demonstrates an approach that individual practitioners and researchers can develop the skills to implement...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn a {{fascinating}} article, Delibes-Mateos et al. (2011) pint point that small mammals {{such as the}} European rabbits, the plateau pikas, the prairie dogs have been traditionally perceived as pests and targeted for control on a very large scale despite their importance as key-stone species in their native ecosystem. This {{is also the case}} for many species of voles in Eurasia and North America (see e. g. Giraudoux and Raoul 2010). However, although a considerable number of studies have been undertaken at local and other scales to understand the mechanisms of vole population outbreaks and cycles, few of them provide basic concepts and useful elements that can be used by ecosystem managers on the scales requested. Lidicker (1995) and Barret & Peles (1999) wrote the first books providing a landscape ecology perspective to small mammal studies. During the 90 s, {{a number of studies have}} shown that small mammal population management could be grounded on knowledge on the effect of landscape on population dynamics. Here we present results obtained from the long term and multi-scale study of two grassland species, Microtus arvalis and Arvicola terrestris to illustrate this approach. We describe at which scales landscape variables were found relevant to explain population dynamics and the consequences of the observed population dynamic patterns on the vertebrate community (other small mammal species and predators including species of conservation value). We argue that long term observational studies at various scales are of primary importance to understand the role of small mammals in regional ecosystems and essential to put experimental studies into relevant context. Such knowledge is critical to provide managers with useful concepts for <b>integrated</b> sustainable <b>landscape</b> <b>management,</b> to protect biodiversity and also for pest and disease control...|$|R

30|$|Social-ecological {{transition}} {{happens when}} gradual or abrupt changes of external or/and internal conditions drive the system {{away from its}} initial dynamic steady state, during which the system undergoes structural changes until new feedback mechanisms are created to regain its stability (Chappin and Ligtvoet 2014; Holling 1973, 2001; Meadowcroft 2011; Rotmans et al. 2001; Scheffer et al. 2001; van den Bergh et al. 2011). The US National Research Council (NRC) addressed the goal of sustainability transition as “a stabilizing world population meets its needs and reduces hunger and poverty while maintaining the planet’s life support systems and living resources” (National Research Council 1999). Towards this end, several fundamental and systemic shifts are required on the global level (Crossman et al. 2013; Gell-Mann 2010; Kates and Parris 2003), including (1) a demographic transition to low population growth rates (Caldwell et al. 2006; Notestein 1983); (2) an economic transition eliminating poverty and hunger and switching to high-level needs that are less harmful to the environment; and (3) technological and institutional transitions which allow the demographic and economic transitions to happen while protecting the environment. Thus, the human-nature relationship would outgrow the hostile stage of “conquering nature” {{as reflected in the}} philosophical and political ideologies, through cooperative coevolution and <b>integrated</b> <b>landscape</b> planning and <b>management</b> (Farina 2000; Naveh 2000, 2005).

To give more specific examples, increased areas of irrigated agricultural land to meet Goal 2 (ending hunger) could have adverse impacts on Goal 15 (terrestrial ecosystems) or on Goal 6 (sustainable water management). Landscape approaches are intended to systematically consider and include diverse stakeholders and sectors, and thus create a mechanism to achieve the multiple objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals - for example, working across the catchment area of a river to enhance agricultural productivity, flood defence, biodiversity and carbon storage, while also strengthened institutions for rural communities.|$|E
