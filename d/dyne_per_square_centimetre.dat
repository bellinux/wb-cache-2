5000|$|Similar to {{selectin}} binding, FimH binding {{also have}} a threshold where it only starts binding to the host cells above this threshold. This shear stress threshold is about 1 <b>dynes</b> <b>per</b> <b>squared</b> centimeter, slightly larger than that of selectin binding. Above this threshold, FimH also alternate between binding, pause and unbinding with the mannose residues. However, different from selectin binding, FimH binding to mannose-BSA can either have a very long or very short pauses. This cause FimH binding to exhibit a [...] "stick-and-roll" [...] adhesion, not rolling adhesion {{in the case of}} selectin binding. And unlike selectin binding which requires integrin to help with firm adhesion, FimH binding can become stationary, and this process is reversible. All of this is mediated by shear stress level: at shear stress higher than 20 <b>dynes</b> <b>per</b> <b>squared</b> centimeter, FimH binding is stationary. At shear stress higher than 100 <b>dynes</b> <b>per</b> <b>squared</b> centimeter, slow rolling is observed.|$|R

The method involved measuring the reaction on a torsional elastic wave propagated down a metal rod when the rod was immersed in sediment. Observations were made over the frequency range two to forty-three kHz. Dispersed sediments behaved like Newtonian liquids. Undispersed sediments, however, were viscoelastic in character, and their shear moduli exhibited no dependence on frequency. For undispersed kaolin mixtures, a typical result is (21. 6 + i 1. 2) x 1, 000 <b>dynes</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> centimeter at 32 percent concentration.

Cells move along the blood vessel at a rate {{proportional}} to the blood flow rate. Once the shear stress pass that shear threshold value, leukocytes start to accumulate via selectin binding. At low shear stress above the threshold of about [...]3 to 5 <b>dynes</b> <b>per</b> <b>squared</b> centimeter, leukocytes alternate between binding and non-binding. Because one leukocyte has many selectins around the surface, these selectin binding/ unbinding cause a rolling motion on the blood vessel. As the shear stress continue to increase, the selectin bonds becomes stronger, causing the rolling velocity to be slower. This reduction in leukocytes rolling velocity allow cells to stop and perform firm binding via integrin binding. Selectin binding do not exhibit [...] "true" [...] catch bond property. Experiments show that at very high shear stress (passing a second threshold), the selectin binding transit between a catch bond to a slip bond binding, in which the rolling velocity increases as the shear force increases.|$|R
