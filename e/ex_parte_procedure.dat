40|$|National Director of Public Prosecutions v Mohamed NO 2003 (1) SACR 561 (CC) was {{an appeal}} against {{a finding that}} s 38 of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 1998 was unconstitutional. In essence, the section allowed the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) to use an <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>procedure</b> {{to apply to the}} High Court for a {{preservation}} of property order (at para 1). The High Court had to make the order `if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the property concerned ± is an instrumentality of an offence referred to in Schedule 1; or is the proceeds of unlawful activities' (at para 14). The High Court held that s 38 should be read as if the words `by way of an ex parte application' did not appear in the section. The court also found that s 38 did not allow for a rule nisi procedure and that this was unconstitutional (at paras 8 and 9). Other challenges against the Act were dismissed by the High Court and the respondent did not challenge these findings in the appeal (at paras 9 and 10) ...|$|E

50|$|The {{background}} {{events are}} undisputed and quickly recounted. Maine has two procedures for involuntary psychiatric hospitalization. Section 3863 provides for temporary hospitalization following <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>procedures</b> — {{that is to}} say, without an adversary proceeding. The procedures include an application by a health or law enforcement officer, a certifying medical examination by a medical practitioner, and an endorsement by a judge or {{justice of the peace}} confirming that these procedures have been followed. Me.Rev.Stat. tit. 34-B, § 3863(1)-(3).|$|R
50|$|In European patent law, the {{limitation}} and revocation procedures before the European Patent Office (EPO) are post-grant, <b>ex</b> <b>parte,</b> administrative <b>procedures</b> allowing any European patent to be centrally limited by an amendment {{of the claims}} or revoked, respectively. These two procedures were introduced in the recently revised text of the European Patent Convention (EPC), i.e. the so-called EPC 2000, which entered into force on 13 December 2007.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{concern over}} the state of patent law {{doctrine}} has led Congress to pass legislation reforming patent reexamination procedures. The effects of the new procedures will remain uncertain for several years. However, Dale Carlson, Co-chair of the Patent Practice Group at Wiggin 2 ̆ 6 Dana, and Jason Crain, a Yale Law School graduate, discuss {{the results of a}} preliminary study of the likely impact of the new inter <b>partes</b> reexamination <b>procedure.</b> In this presentation, Carlson and Crain examine some of the driving forces behind the reform initiative and compare <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> reexamination <b>procedures</b> with inter <b>partes</b> reexamination <b>procedures.</b> In particular, they address concerns of biases inherent in the new procedure. Ultimately, Carlson and Crain suggest that the new procedure will provide a viable alternative to patent litigation, particularly for small inventors...|$|R
50|$|Accordingly, {{as federal}} and Maine law stood and still stand, Small and Rehlanderwere {{permanently}} deprived {{of a right}} to bear arms based solely on procedures suitable for temporary hospitalization under emergency conditions. Understandably, nothing in those procedures provided an advance adversary proceeding to test whether the subject was mentally ill or dangerous, but there is also no effective post-hospitalization means to recover the {{right to bear arms}} if the subject had in fact never been mentally ill or dangerous.The constitutional doubts raised by such a regime are sufficient that we now conclude that section 922 should not be read to encompass a temporary hospitalization attended only by the <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>procedures</b> of section 3863. The ordinary rule is that statutes are to be read to avoid serious constitutional doubts, if that course is possible, Jones v. United States, 529 U.S. 848, 857, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000), and it is readily possible here. Indeed, some circuit courts had read procedures like section 3863 not to create disability even without constitutional doubts awakened by Heller. See note 1, above. And it is textually permissible to read section 922 not to be triggered by a section 3863 hospitalization.|$|R
50|$|The grant {{procedure}} before the European Patent Office (EPO) is an <b>ex</b> <b>parte,</b> administrative <b>procedure,</b> {{which includes the}} filing of a European patent application, the examination of formalities, {{the establishment of a}} search report, the publication of the application, its substantive examination, and the grant of a patent, or the refusal of the application, in accordance with the legal provisions of the European Patent Convention (EPC). The {{grant procedure}} is carried out by the EPO {{under the supervision of the}} Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation. The patents granted in accordance with the EPC are called European patents.|$|R
5000|$|The {{issues before}} us are legal and our review is {{therefore}} de novo. United States v. Volungus, 595 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2010). The appellants press their constitutional claims in various permutations; {{the most potent}} is that, given Heller's pronouncement of an individual constitutional right to possess arms, the <b>ex</b> <b>parte</b> <b>procedures</b> employed under section 3863 may justify temporary hospitalization but not a permanent deprivation {{of the right to}} bear arms — permanent given the lack of any meaningful way ever to recapture that right.We conclude that this claim is sufficiently powerful that the doctrine of constitutional avoidance requires us to revisit our prior interpretation of section 922(g)(4); and, in doing so, we conclude that section 3863 proceedings do not qualify as a [...] "commitment" [...] for federal purposes. Ordinarily, panel decisions like Chamberlain are binding on subsequent panels but not where intervening Supreme Court precedent requires reconsideration. United States v. Rodríguez, 527 F.3d 221, 224-25 (1st Cir.2008).Chamberlain, at the time it was rendered, was a reasonable albeit not compulsory reading of section 922(g)(4). Although section 3863 did not use the word [...] "commitment" [...] and its <b>procedures</b> were effectively <b>ex</b> <b>parte,</b> it was clear from section 922's legislative history cited in the decision 48*48 that Congress intended an expansive interpretation. Other circuits reached differing conclusions regarding emergency hospitalization procedures similar to section 3863, see note 1, above, but none indicated that there was a constitutional dimension to the problem.|$|R
