5|$|Though quite agile on land (capable {{of running}} as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> horse), capybaras are equally {{at home in}} the water. They are {{excellent}} swimmers, and can remain completely submerged for up to five minutes, an ability they use to evade predators. Capybaras can sleep in water, keeping only their noses out of the water. As temperatures increase during the day, they wallow in water and then graze during the late afternoon and early evening. They also spend time wallowing in mud. They rest around midnight and then continue to graze before dawn.|$|E

25|$|For a basic {{oxy-acetylene}} rig, {{the cutting}} speed in light steel section will usually be {{nearly twice as}} <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> petrol-driven cut-off grinder. The advantages when cutting large sections are obvious: an oxy-fuel torch is light, small and quiet and needs very little effort to use, whereas a cut-off grinder is heavy and noisy and needs considerable operator exertion and may vibrate severely, leading to stiff hands and possible long-term vibration white finger. Oxy-acetylene torches can easily cut through ferrous materials in excess of 200mm (8inches). Oxygen lances are used in scrapping operations and cut sections thicker than 200mm (8inches). Cut-off grinders are useless {{for these kinds of}} application.|$|E
25|$|The {{aquarium}} strain reproduces asexually, that is, vegetatively: the viscous, elastic white fluid {{inside the}} stem was found {{under the microscope}} to contain only male gametes. Rate of growth can be as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> centimeter per day. If any small part is severed {{from the rest of}} the alga, this small part will regrow into another alga. Anchors of ships and fishing nets can serve as carriers of Caulerpa. Thus this alga has been found to jump from the coast of one port city to the coast of another port city. The natural strain has both male and female individuals and additionally reproduces sexually. Gametes are expelled from each sex and meet to form a zygote which then goes through two larval stages before becoming an adult.|$|E

That day, the National Bank of Commerce where J.P. Morgan was a dominant factor, announced it would not serve as clearing house for the Knickerbocker. On October 22, the Knickerbocker faced a classic bank run. From the bank's opening, the crowd grew. As The New York Times reported, [...] "as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> depositor went out of the place ten people and more came asking for their money [...] were asked to send some men to keep order". Two van loads of notes were quickly unloaded, yet even this failed to calm the panic stricken depositors.

Shortly after noon it was forced to suspend operations.|$|E

2500|$|Normally, {{a breath}} is taken every other stroke. This can be {{sustained}} over long distances. Often, breathing every stroke slows the swimmer down. (At a certain level, a breathing stroke becomes just as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nonbreathing stroke; therefore, very experienced competitors, such as Michael Phelps, may breathe every stroke.) Other intervals of breathing practised by elite swimmers include the [...] "two up, one down" [...] approach in which the swimmer breathes for two successive strokes and then keeps their head in the water on the next stroke, which is easier on the lungs. Swimmers with good lung capacity might also breathe every 3rd stroke during sprints for the finish. Some swimmers can even hold their breaths for an entire race (assuming {{that it is a}} short one). To be able to swim with best results {{it is important to keep}} one's head down when taking a breath. If the swimmer lifts his or her head too high the swimmer's hips often drop, creating drag, thus slowing the swimmer down. The closer one's head is to the water the better one swim is the general technique used by swimmers.|$|E
