40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between recapitalization and banks performance in Nigeria. In order achieve the objective of the study, a time series data was generated for 2000 to 2009 periods. The data was analysed using independent t-test and the study found that net interest margin, funding cost, significantly increases in post-recapitalisation period. On the other hand the study found an insignificant <b>decrease</b> in return <b>on</b> <b>assets</b> of banks after recapitalised. Therefore, the study concluded that the policy (recapitalisation) would subject banks (especially the small banks) in the country into severe liquidity crisis. The study recommended among others, that recapitalization policy should be undertaken with pinch of salt because the major obstacle facing Nigerian banks is not peculiar with shortage of capital. Therefore, only banks with acute shortage of capital should be coercing to increase their capital to enable them enjoy economic scale of operation. Similarly an Islamic banks should be established with branches in Muslims dominated areas, this is based on the experiences of the countries practicing such unique banking were not immune to global economic crisis...|$|R
30|$|A {{sole focus}} <b>on</b> <b>decreases</b> in <b>assets</b> {{leads to a}} one-sided {{strategy}} that lacks sufficient leverage and makes the firm more prone to crises (Sheaffer and Mano-Negrin 2003). Dahiya et al. (2003) highlight the possibility of debtor-in-possession financing. This type of secured financing for firms under Chapter 11 bankruptcy enables investments, thus increasing firms’ chances for survival. Acquiring new resources positively affects firms’ recovery (Morrow et al. 2007; Smith and Graves 2005; Wu 2013). However, the positive effect is limited to true investments. Refocusing strategies that contain only alliances or joint ventures are not found to yield positive returns (Morrow et al. 2007). Furthermore, Wan and Yiu (2009) note that acquisitions are the most effective during environmental turmoil, with only limited effects in stable contexts.|$|R
