25|$|Considerable {{catches of}} {{northern}} whiting are made but generally not {{reflected in the}} <b>fishery</b> <b>statistics</b> of countries they are taken in. In Pakistan the main fishery takes place in June to July. The catches reported in this single country range from 102 t (1980) to 859 t (1982) {{with an average of}} 404 t.

25|$|Despite its {{commercial}} importance, overall <b>fishery</b> <b>statistics</b> for the spadenose shark are lacking. A 1996 report {{found it to}} be the most common coastal shark on Chinese markets. Substantial numbers are caught by Indian and Pakistani fisheries; from 1979 to 1981, an average of 823 tons were caught annually off Verval, India. The spadenose shark is also caught as bycatch, particularly in gillnet fisheries off Kalimantan. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as Near Threatened; the spadenose shark's relatively short reproductive cycle may render it more resilient to fishing pressure than other sharks, though its low fecundity still merits caution. This shark may also be negatively affected by coastal development, due to its inshore habitat preferences.|$|E

25|$|The giant {{trevally}} is of high {{importance to}} modern fisheries throughout its range, although quantifying the amounts taken {{is very difficult}} {{due to the lack}} of <b>fishery</b> <b>statistics</b> kept in most of these countries. Hawaii has the best-kept statistics, where the 1998 catch consisted of 10,194 pounds of giant trevally worth around US$12,000. Historically, the species has been taken in far greater numbers, and has been an important food, market and game fish since the early 1900s. However, their exploitation has seen the landings of the species decrease by over 84% since the turn of the century, declining from 725,000lb to 10,000lb in recent catches. FAO statistics of the Asian region record catches between 4,000 and 10,000 tonnes between 1997 and 2007, although this excludes most fisheries which are not monitored or do not discriminate between trevally species. The giant trevally is commercially caught by a number of methods, including hook and line, handlines, gill nets and other types of artisanal traps. The species has also successfully been bred for aquaculture purposes in Taiwan. It is sold at market fresh, frozen, salted, and smoked, and as fishmeal and oil.|$|E

He continued in that capacity until he was appointed by United States President Grover Cleveland in January 1888 to replace Dr. George Brown Goode as the Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries. Brown had been temporarily filling the position of Fish Commissioner following Baird's death. McDonald took his oath of office on February 18, 1888.
