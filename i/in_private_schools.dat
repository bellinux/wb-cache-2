40|$|Chronic {{suppurative}} {{otitis media}} {{is one of}} the common ear diseases of the ear, particularly in childhood. It is the commonest cause of persistent mild to moderate hearing impairment in children and young adults. AIM: To find out the prevalence of chronic suppurative otitis media among school children studying <b>in</b> urban <b>private</b> <b>schools</b> of Nepal. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was carried out among 500 school children aged between 5 - 15 years. Students were selected from urban <b>private</b> <b>schools</b> of four districts of Nepal. In all students, history was taken and otoscopic examination done from May 2006 to October 2006. Data were described using frequency and percentage. Study design: Prospective cross sectional study. RESULTS: Results showed that the prevalence of chronic suppurative otitis media in children studying <b>in</b> urban <b>private</b> <b>schools</b> of Nepal is 5. 0 %. Unilateral disease was seen in 72. 0 %, 76. 0 % had a tubotympanic disease and 24. 0 % had atticoantral disease. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of chronic suppurative otitis media <b>in</b> urban <b>private</b> <b>school</b> children <b>in</b> Nepal is higher than other studies done <b>in</b> <b>private</b> <b>school</b> children. Health education, improvement of socioeconomic status and health facilities will be helpful in reducing the prevalence of chronic suppurative otitis media...|$|R
