If the density and pressure are both set equal to functions of the radius {{from the center of}} the star, the system of equations consisting of the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>equation</b> together with the equation of state can then be solved to find the structure of the white dwarf at equilibrium. In the non-relativistic case, we will still find that the radius is inversely proportional to the cube root of the mass., eq.

This is the limiting value of the mass—called the Chandrasekhar limit—at which the white dwarf can no longer be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The graph on the right shows the result of such a computation. It shows how radius varies with mass for non-relativistic (blue curve) and relativistic (green curve) models of a white dwarf. Both models treat the white dwarf as a cold Fermi gas in hydrostatic equilibrium. The average molecular weight per electron, , has been set equal to 2.

5000|$|Electron {{degeneracy}} {{pressure is}} a quantum-mechanical effect {{arising from the}} Pauli exclusion principle. Since electrons are fermions, no two electrons {{can be in the}} same state, so not all electrons can be in the minimum-energy level. Rather, electrons must occupy a band of energy levels. Compression of the electron gas increases the number of electrons in a given volume and raises the maximum energy level in the occupied band. Therefore, the energy of the electrons increases on compression, so pressure must be exerted on the electron gas to compress it, producing electron degeneracy pressure. With sufficient compression, electrons are forced into nuclei in the process of electron capture, relieving the pressure.In the nonrelativistic case, electron degeneracy pressure gives rise to an equation of state of the form , where P is the pressure, [...] is the mass density, and [...] is a constant.
