50|$|A DIP switch is {{a manual}} {{electric}} switch that is packaged {{with others in}} a group in a standard dual in-line package (DIP). The term may refer to each <b>individual</b> <b>switch,</b> or to the unit as a whole. This type of switch {{is designed to be}} used on a printed circuit board along with other electronic components and is commonly used to customize the behavior of an electronic device for specific situations.|$|E
5000|$|While larger [...] "decorator" [...] style {{switches}} {{are readily}} available in Australia, {{the advantage of the}} smaller mechanisms is that wall-plates are available to mount from one to six <b>individual</b> <b>switch</b> mechanisms, or other correspondingly sized [...] "mechanisms" [...] - such as dimmers and indicator lights - in the same space as one (or two) switches of larger design could be mounted. Since the mechanisms are small, they can also be mounted into [...] "architrave" [...] plates, for mounting in positions where {{it is not possible to}} mount a [...] "standard" [...] sized wall-plate. An example is shown in the picture below on the right. All of the switch mechanisms have no exposed metal parts requiring grounding (earthing). While switches, wall-plates and cover plates from different manufacturers tend not to be interchangeable, switch mechanisms of this type have been available in Australia since 1971. The keystone module system for extra-low voltage electrical jacks (patented in 1995) is somewhat similar in appearance to these modules, but the design of the keystone mountings are different, and keystone modules can be removed without the use of a tool. (A similar system, but with bigger switches, is used in Italy.) ...|$|E

50|$|However, in {{the early}} 1960s Teisco {{products}} became increasingly unique. Teisco guitars became notable for unusual body shapes, such as the May Queen design resembling an artist's palette, or other unusual features such as having four pickups (most guitars have two or three). The vast amount of controls; typically an <b>individual</b> <b>switch</b> for each pickup, plus a tone or phase-cancellation switch, along {{with as many as}} five tone and volume knobs gave a wide variety of sounds yet were easily switched while playing. After Kawai bought Teisco in 1967, they started to produce all the Teisco guitars, as well as their own brand, Apollo. Hound Dog Taylor famously used a variety of these Kawai-era Teiscos, which he bought at his local Sears department store. Jim Reid of The Jesus and Mary Chain used a Spectrum V. Also, James Iha of The Smashing Pumpkins played a K-2L, which can seen in the music video for Rocket (The Smashing Pumpkins song) as well as the inside of the Pisces Iscariot CD jewel case. Ben Waugh (Scott Campbell), singer & guitarist for Apparition, The Sillies, and Scott Campbell Group played a modified ET-200 onstage and for studio recordings until it was stolen in 1985.|$|E

40|$|Social {{phenomena}} often involve long-term changes, {{but most}} organizational studies focusing on sector comparison have not illuminated the decisive role that time plays. I tested "sector imprinting," {{the effect that}} occurs when an individual who has adapted to the norms of one sector, moves to another sector, by using a sample comprised of respondents from both public and nonprofit organizations. I found that in the public sector, <b>individuals</b> <b>switching</b> from business enterprises and nonprofit organizations perceive more formalized personnel rules and red tape than individuals who have not switched sectors. In the nonprofit sector, <b>individuals</b> <b>switching</b> from the government perceive lower levels of formalized rules and red tape as compared to non-switchers and switchers from the private sector. Although unpleasant rules are critical sources of one's turnover intention, <b>individuals</b> who <b>switch</b> into the public sector have longer current job tenure than non-switchers. I argue that the theories of contrast effect, selfpersuasion, extrinsic motivation, and public service motivation (PSM) help explain these findings.

These methodologies allow for real time calculation of the optimal switching interval of each <b>individual</b> <b>switch</b> of the matrix converter. These new switching algorithms allow optimal performances, ensuring sinusoidal outputs at any desired power factor. This paper will first revise the underlying theory of matrix converters, then review the various control limitations and finally review the current control algorithm...|$|E
40|$|A {{transmission}} line transformer (TLT) -based multiple-switch circuit topology was recently proposed for pulsed-power generation.

It is attractive to be used to design a long-lifetime repetitive large pulsed-power source (100 kW, 1 kHz) for various kinds of applications, such as corona plasma-induced gas cleaning. To gain insight into the synchronization principle and switching behavior of the <b>individual</b> <b>switch,</b> an equivalent circuit model was developed and an experimental setup with two spark-gap switches and a two-stage TLT has been constructed. We observed that in terms of switching currents, the two switches can be synchronized within 2 â€“ 3 ns. The equivalent circuit model approximately fits the experimental result...|$|E

40|$|Abstract â€” Recent {{research}} in packet switch scheduling algorithms has moved beyond throughput maximization to {{quality of service}} (QoS) control. Several classes of algorithms {{have been shown to}} achieve maximal throughput under certain system conditions. Between classes and within each class, QoS performance varies based on arrival traffic and properties of the scheduling algorithm being utilized. Here we compare two classes of throughput-maximizing algorithms and their performance with respect to buffer sizes. These classes are randomized algorithms, which can be characterized as offline algorithms, and projective cone scheduling algorithms, which are online since they respond to the current workload in the system. In each class, parameters can be fine-tuned to reflect the priorities of <b>individual</b> <b>switch</b> ports. We show how the online algorithms lead to significantly better quality of service performance. I...|$|E
40|$|One popular FPGA {{interconnection}} {{network is}} based on the islandstyle model, where rows and columns of logic blocks are separated by channels containing routing wires. Switch blocks are placed at the intersections of the horizontal and vertical channels to allow the wires to be connected together. Previous switch block design has focused on the analysis of <b>individual</b> <b>switch</b> blocks or the use of ad hoc design with experimental evaluation. This paper presents an analytical framework which considers the design of a continuous fabric of switch blocks containing wire segments of any length. The framework is used to design new switch blocks which are experimentally shown to be as effective as the best ones known to date. With this framework, we hope to inspire new ways of looking at switch block design...|$|E

We elaborate on the mathematical semantics of <b>individual</b> <b>switch</b> elements as well as complete switched bond graphs, i. e. bond graphs involving one or more switch elements.

40|$|Establishing a {{multicast}} {{tree in a}} point-to-point {{network of}} switch nodes, such as a wide-area ATM network, is often modeled as the NP-complete Steiner problem in networks. In this paper, we present distributed algorithms for finding efficient multicast trees {{in the presence of}} constraints on the copying ability of the <b>individual</b> <b>switch</b> nodes in the network. We refer to this problem as the degree-constrained multicast tree problem and model it as the degree-constrained Steiner problem (DCSP) in networks. We consider two distinct approaches to the design of distributed DCPS heuristics. The first approach involves design of distributed versions of centralized DCSP algorithms. We introduce distributed versions of two DCSP heuristics: the shortest path heuristic (SPH) and the Kruskal-based shortest path heuristic (K-SPH). The second approach is to modify the solution obtained from an unconstrained heuristic to satisfy the degree constraints using a distributed post-processing algor [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a breakthrough decomposition theorem on routing topology and its {{applications in the}} designing of universal switch blocks. A switch block of k sides and W terminals on each side {{is said to be}} universal (a (k,W) -USB) if it is routable for every set of 2 -pin nets with channel density at most W. The optimum USB design prob-lem is to design a (k,W) -USB with the minimum number of switches for every pair of (k, W). The problem was originated from designing bet-ter k sides switch modules for 2 D-FPGAs, such as Xilinx XC 4000 -type FPGAs, where k â‰¤ 4. The interests in the generic USBs come from their potential usages in multi-dimensional and some non-conventional 2 D-FPGA architectures, and as an <b>individual</b> <b>switch</b> components. The optimum (k,W) -USB was solved previously for even W, but left open for odd W. Our new decomposition theorem states that when W (> k+ 3 âˆ’i...|$|E
