40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarIn {{this report}} we present samples of how <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>microorganisms</b> (GMM) {{were mailed to}} us from various countries, {{including}} the Netherlands. None of the six packages that contained GMM and arrived by air mail, complied {{to the rules of}} the IATA, whereas a further three, which arrived by national mail did not comply to Dutch law. Except two, all packages were a clear result of ingenuity of the sender. We subjected the ten packages to simple rigidity tests, namely 1) dropping it, 2) stepping on the parcel and 3) dropping a weight of 6. 3 kg on top of it from a height of 1 m. Only one, a parcel harboring commercial obtainable "Culturettes" (Manufactured by Baxter Health Care Products), survived these tests completely undamaged. We compared our experiences with two departments which receive <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> bacteria and human pathogens, respectively on a regular basis, namely the PHABAGEN culture collection (University of Utrecht, the Netherlands) and the Laboratory of Bacterial Determinations (National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection, Bilthoven, the Netherlands). Apart from confirming our experiences to a large extend, their experiences indicate that the vials in about 0. 5 % of the packages will be damaged. If our assumptions are correct, an estimated 3000 packages containing cultures of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>microorganisms</b> are mailed in the Netherlands each year. An estimated 15 of these will be damaged during handling, which, at the present standards of mailing, will result in the unintended, small scale, introduction into the environment of the <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>microorganisms</b> involved. Our overall conclusion is therefore that the present standards of mailing of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>microorganisms</b> are insufficient to protect environment and (post) man against possible risks...|$|R

The impact on the indigenous microbial populations resulting from release of this <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>microorganism</b> (GMM) was compared with the impact of the unmodified, wild-type strain and a nontreated control until 1 month after harvest of the crop. The release of the P. fluorescens GMM and the unmodified, wild-type strain resulted in significant but transient perturbations of some of the culturable components of the indigenous microbial communities that inhabited the rhizosphere and phylloplane of wheat, but no significant perturbations of the indigenous culturable microbial populations in nonrhizosphere soil were found. Fast-growing organisms that did not produce resting structures (for example, fluorescent pseudomonads and yeasts) seemed to be most sensitive to perturbation. In terms of hazard and risk to the environment, the observed microbial perturbations that resulted from this GMM release may be considered minor for several reasons. First, the recombinant P. fluorescens strain caused changes that were, in general, not significantly different from those caused by the unmodified wild-type strain; second, perturbations resulting from bacterial inoculations were mainly small; and third, the release of bacteria had no obvious effects on plant growth and plant health...|$|E

Additionally, the introduction of butanol and the by-product acetone to the product portfolio of biorefineries led to increased revenues in comparison to base scenarios, which can ultimately help to mitigate environmental impacts of the biorefinery in monetary terms.

However, the knockout of protein Y significantly decreased the final titer achieved, the opposite trend as expected. The double knockout of protein X and protein Y resulted in the same decrease in fatty acid titer as the protein Y knockout, but the double knockout stain exhibited drastically different growth rates. The double knockout enabled growth rates to rise, and the final titer was reached over twice as fast as the other three strains.

This thesis studies one plant growth-promoting bacterial strain, Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW 25, and its interactions with winter wheat, potato and tomato in both field and laboratory conditions. This bacterium was tagged with a novel marker gene cassette containing gfp (green fluorescent protein), luxAB (bacterial bioluminescence) and telABkilA (potassium tellurite oxide resistance) and the resulting strain SBW 25 ::tgl was released in the first field trial with a <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>microorganism</b> in Sweden. Bacterial numbers on wheat plants and in soil were determined by selective plating on media containing potassium tellurite oxide. The impact of SBW 25 ::tgl on wheat plant growth was measured using plant length and weight, and possible effects on resident bacterial and fungal microflora was evaluated throughout the 8 months sampling period using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). The GMM was found in high numbers on all plant parts throughout the 8 months period, but only minor impacts were found on native microflora due to bacterial (GMM or wild-type) inoculation. SBW 25 was also evaluated as a biocontrol agent towards the phytopathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum on tomato and potato plants. By using gfp-tagged R. solanacearum and red fluorescent protein (rfp) -tagged SBW 25 it was possible to distinguish these two strains on plant surfaces using microscopic techniques. Plate counting, flow cytometry and luminometry were used to monitor the strains on plants. Some biocontrol effect of SBW 25 was detected on tomato plants. The interactions of SBW 25 and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi Glomus mosseae and G. intraradices were also studied.

The L-glutamic acid is produced by the genetically modified Corynebacterium glutamicum EA- 12 strain. The recipient strain Corynebacterium glutamicum Â strain 2256 Â has been recommended for Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) status. No antibiotic resistance genes were left in the genome and neither the production strain nor its recombinant DNA were detected in the final product. The Panel considered there were no safety concerns for consumers from the genetic modification. The proposed uses or use levels of L-glutamic acid and its salt derivatives produced with the current strain and the new <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>microorganism</b> (GMM) strain will be identical and thus the Panel considered that the exposure to the food additive will remain unaffected.

TnPCB was stably {{inserted into the}} chromosome of two different rhizosphere pseudomonads. One genetically modified strain, Pseudomonas fluorescens F 113 pcb, was characterized in detail and found to be unaltered in important parameters such as growth rate and production of secondary metabolites. The expression of the heterologous bph genes in F 113 pcb was confirmed by {{the ability of the}} <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>microorganism</b> to utilize biphenyl as a sole carbon source. The introduced trait remained stable in laboratory experiments, and no bph-negative isolates were found after extensive subculture in nonselective media. The bph trait was also stable in nonselective rhizosphere microcosms. Rhizosphere competence of the modified F 113 pcb was assessed in colonization experiments in nonsterile soil microcosms on sugar beet seedling roots. F 113 pcb was able to colonize as efficiently as a marked wild-type strain, and no decrease in competitiveness was observed. In situ expression of the bph genes in F 113 pcb was found when F 113 pcb bearing a bph'lacZ reporter fusion was inoculated onto sugar beet seeds. This indicates that the bph gene products may also be present under in situ conditions. These experiments demonstrated that rhizosphere-adapted microbes can be genetically manipulated to metabolize novel compounds without affecting their ecological competence. Expression of the introduced genes can be detected in the rhizosphere, indicating considerable potential for the manipulation of the rhizosphere as a self-sustaining biofilm for the bioremediation of pollutants in soil. Rhizosphere bacteria such as fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. are ecologically adapted to colonize and compete in the rhizosphere environment. Expanding the metabolic functions of such pseudomonads to degrade pollutants may prove to be a useful strategy for bioremediation...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{display is}} a {{powerful}} technique that utilizes natural microbial functional components to express proteins or peptides on the cell exterior. Since the reporting of the first surface-display system in the mid- 1980 s, {{a variety of new}} systems have been reported for yeast, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Non-conventional display methods are emerging, eliminating the generation of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>microorganisms.</b> Cells with surface display are used as biocatalysts, biosorbents and biostimulants. Microbial cell-surface display has proven to be extremely important for numerous applications ranging from combinatorial library screening and protein engineering to bioremediation and biofuels production...|$|R

However, major constraints to the commercialization of these processes include lower hydrogen yields and rates of hydrogen production. To overcome these bottlenecks intensive research work has already been carried out on the advancement of these processes such as the development of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>microorganisms,</b> the improvement of the bioreactor design, molecular engineering of the key enzyme hydrogenases, the development of two stage processes, etc. The present paper explores the recent advancements that have been made till date and also presents {{the state of the art}} in molecular strategies to improve the hydrogen production...|$|R
40|$|Harmful {{effects of}} {{contaminants}} on the ecosystem and humans can not be assessed by standard chemical analyses of environmental samples, therefore toxicity tests using live organisms or cells represent {{a vital part of}} environmental monitoring. Many different biological methods based on native or <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>microorganisms</b> as test-species, have already successfully been applied to environmental toxicity/genotoxicity assessment. An important reason is the modern 3 R concept (reduction, replacement, refinement) in toxicology and ecotoxicology, which promotes the application of microorganisms in biotests due to simple cultivation in axenic cultures and {{due to the lack of}} ethical problems. The article reviews the most important applications of bacteria, protozoa, algae and yeasts in biomonitoring, starting with classical physiology-based toxicity bioassays, proceeding to genotoxicity assays, immunoassays and endocrine disruptor assays and concluding with upcoming approaches of toxicogenomics...|$|R
