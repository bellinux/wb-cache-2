40|$|The present {{paper is}} devoted {{mainly to the}} half space problem for {{stationary}} Boltzmann-type equations. Using only conservation laws and the Boltzmann H-theorem we derive an inequality for unknown constant fluxes of mass, energy, and momentum. This inequality is {{expressed in terms of}} three parameters (pressure p, temperature T and the Mach number M) of the asymptotic Maxwellian at infinity. Geometrically the inequality describes a “physical” domain with positive entropy production in the 3 -d space of the parameters. The domain appears to be qualitatively different for evaporation and condensation problems. We show that for given M, the curve p=p(M), T=T(M) of maximal entropy production practically coincides with the experimental <b>evaporation</b> <b>curve</b> obtained by Sone et al. on the basis of numerical solutions of BGK equation. Similar consideration for the condensation problem is also in qualitative agreement with known numerical results...|$|E
40|$|Two {{types of}} {{instruments}} were installed in a borehole in order to monitor matric and water potentials of various hydrogeologic units consisting of tuff. The borehole was drilled {{as part of a}} study to provide information to the US Department of Energy for their use in evaluating Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for a repository for high-level radioactive waste. Heat-dissipation probes were used to monitor matric potentials and thermocouple psychrometers were used to monitor water potentials. Two major concerns regarding the use of these instruments in deep boreholes are: (1) the effect of length of the lead wires, and (2) the inability to recalibrate the instruments after installation. The length of the lead wire contributes to the source resistance and lead capacitance, which affects the signal settling time. Both instruments tested proved to be insensitive to lead-wire length, except when connected to smaller input-impedance data loggers. Thermocouple wires were more sensitive than heat-dissipation probe wires because of their greater resistance and quality of voltmeters used. Two thermocouple psychrometers were installed at every instrument station for backup and verification of data, because the instruments could not be recalibrated in situ. Multiple scanning rather than single-point scanning of the <b>evaporation</b> <b>curve</b> of a thermocouple psychrometer could give more reliable data, especially in differentiating between very wet and very dry environments. An isolated power supply needs to be used for each heat dissipation probe rather than a single power supply for a group of probes to avoid losing data from all probes when one probe malfunctions. This type of system is particularly desirable if the site is unattended by an operator for as long as a month. 20 refs., 13 figs., 2 tabs...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} high heat flux removal has been {{triggered}} {{by the development of}} new technologies ranging from computers, data centers, medical applications, electric cars, radars, satellite, and lasers, to mention some applications. Today it is recognized that manufacturability is not the limiting factor with regards to the small size of the devices and that major challenge is the power dissipation problem. Spray cooling has been shown as a possible solution for cooling of high heat fluxes systems. However, the Leidenfrost phenomena pose a limitation to the use of liquid to cool down hot surfaces as it prevents the dissipation of heat. This effect consists of the development of a vapor layer that makes the impinging cooling fluid bounce away when impacting the hot surface, becoming heat dissipation ineffective. This regime is named film boiling. The primary objective of this work is to experimentally determine the different boiling regimes and Leidenfrost point for deionized water and various dielectric fluids evaluating the influence of fluids properties and the dependence of droplet impact height over a heated plain silicon surface. Furthermore, designing and fabrication of a test section for studying impacting droplets over a plain silicon surface have been completed. Final results show and discuss the different droplet deposition heights <b>evaporation</b> <b>curves</b> for deionized water and FC- 72, boiling regimes along the deionized water and FC- 72 experimental curve, Weber map showing different boiling regions and a comparison between deionized water and FC- 72 performance...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a new top boundary condition (TBC) for representing the air-soil diffusive exchange of a generic volatile tracer. This new TBC (1) {{accounts for the}} multi-phase flow of a generic tracer; (2) accounts for effects of soil temperature, pH, solubility, sorption, and desorption processes; (3) enables a smooth transition between wet and dry soil conditions; (4) {{is compatible with the}} conductance formulation for modeling air-water volatile tracer exchange; and (5) is applicable to site, regional, and global land models. Based on the new TBC, we developed new formulations for bare-soil resistance and corresponding soil evaporation efficiency. The new soil resistance is predicted as the reciprocal of the harmonic sum of two resistances: (1) gaseous and aqueous molecular diffusion and (2) liquid mass flow resulting from the hydraulic pressure gradient between the soil surface and center of the topsoil control volume. The resulting soil evaporation efficiency reasonably explains the two-stage soil <b>evaporation</b> <b>curves</b> typically observed in field and laboratory soil evaporation measurements. Comparison with the soil evaporation efficiency equation of Lee and Pielke (1992; hereafter LP 92) indicates that their equation can overestimate soil evaporation when the atmospheric resistance is low and underestimate soil evaporation when the soil is dry. Using a synthetic inversion experiment, we demonstrated that using inverted soil resistance data from field measurements to derive empirical soil resistance formulations resulted in large uncertainty because (1) the inverted soil resistance data is always severely impacted by measurement error and (2) the derived empirical equation is very sensitive to the number of data points and the assumed functional form of the resistance. We expect the application of our new TBC in land models will provide a consistent representation for the diffusive tracer exchange at the soil–air interface...|$|R

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{low-energy}} charged particles emitted from the interactions of 6 BeV and 27 BeV protons with silver and bromine nuclei in nuclear emulsions. The energy spectra of the protons and alpha particles are compared with the Weisskopf evaporation theory and with experimental results at other bombarding energies. The evaporation temperatures of the excited nuclei were determined for the emission of protons (including deuterons and tritons) and alpha particles, respectively, for the two primary proton energies of 6 BeV and 27 BeV. The two proton energy spectra are consistent with an evaporation temperature of 4 to 5 MeV and a potential barrier V° ∼ 3 - 4 MeV. For the alpha particle spectra, the parameters for the <b>evaporation</b> <b>curves</b> which give the best fit to the experimental distributions are a temperature, T, of the order of 10 to 12 MeV and a potential barrier V° very nearly equal to zero. These abnormally high temperatures (greater than the binding energy of a nucleon inside the nucleus) indicate the emission process cannot be entirely explained in terms of a normal mechanism of evaporation from a thermodynamic equilibrium state. Applying the value of T obtained from the proton energy spectra, with a value of V° - 7 - 8 MeV, gives a satisfactory fit of the theoretical curve to the experimental distribution for alpha energies less than 30 MeV. A study of the angular distributions of the emitted particles alpha shows that the emission is anisotropic, the distribution being peaked in the forward direction; this peaking is more pronounced at 6 BeV than at 27 BeV. In both cases, the forward peaking appears to be due exclusively to alpha particles of energy greater than 30 MeV. We may conclude, therefore, that these higher-energy particles are probably associated with secondary interactions provoked by the cascade, rather than with the pure evaporation process. In an attempt to understand the processes of interaction of 6 BeV protons with heavy nuclei, the angular distributions of the black tracks have been studied for stars previously analyzed in terms of the charged pi-meson distribution. The results are discussed for the cases when the incident proton collides: (a) with a single nucleon in the target nucleus, and (b) with 3 to 5 target nucleons. The results indicate that the interactions with a single target nucleon occur at the periphery of the nucleus, the two nucleons then leaving the nucleus without initiating a cascade. The star size and the average excitation energy are found to be smaller for the single nucleon interactions than {{in the case of the}} (3 - 4 - 5) target nucleon interactions and the probability of fragment emission appears to be greater...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1963 A five-year {{clipping}} {{experiment was}} conducted to determine maximum sustained utilization levels for three big game browse plant species in central Arizona. The three species were mountain-mahogany (Cercocarpus breviflorus) and desert ceanothus (Ceanothus Greggii) in the chaparral type, and cliff-rose (Cowania mexicana var. Stensburiana) in the pinyon-juniper type. Experimental treatments were removal of 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent of current annual twig growth plus a more severe treatment involving removal of all twigs larger than four millimeters in diameter. Treatments were applied each October to ten replications. Data recorded were green and oven-dry weight per plot, total number of current twigs per plot, and mean twig length. Other data obtained were monthly precipitation, weekly maximum-minimum temperatures, monthly twig elongation, and phenological observations. Soil moisture trends were traced by electrical resistance methods during 1961 and 1962. Soil samples were subjected to mechanical analyses and bulk density determinations. Soil moisture content at permanent wilting point and field capacity were estimated from field trend <b>curves,</b> from sample <b>evaporation</b> <b>curves,</b> and from pressure membrane tests one-third and 15 atmospheres pressure. The five-year duration of the experiment was not sufficient to establish a definitive response to clipping. All species were stimulated initially by heavy clipping. This growth stimulation persisted throughout the study in cliff-rose and, to a lesser extent, in mountain-mahogany. Ceanothus four-millimeter plots were rapidly dying off {{at the close of}} the study and 100 percent plots were showing loss of vigor. It was tentatively concluded that 75 percent use was permissible for cliff-rose and probably also for mountain-mahogany. Use on ceanothus probably should not exceed 50 percent. Throughout the study, production under moderate use was higher than under no use. The chaparral site was located on deep granitic soils and was characterized by separate and independent spring and summer growth seasons. Annual, browse production was correlated best with annual or summer rainfall. The pinyon-juniper site was located on a limestone outcrop, and growth was strongly dependent upon winter precipitation. After a good winter, browse growth continued uninterrupted throughout the summer. The difference in growth regimes at the two sites appeared to be the result of highly efficient retention of moisture in the limestone substrate. Soil moisture depletion in the spring proceeded from the surface downward. The depletion curves were very steep, as would be expected in sandy loam sells. The range of available moisture was about ten percent. Spring browse growth began in late March when soil temperatures reached 45 to 50 ° F. Growth cessation occurred about October 1 each year and appeared to be the result of early frost. The maximum annual growth season ran about 190 days, but high soil moisture stress reduced this season drastically when either winter-spring or summer precipitation was inadequate. Soil moisture data were reported in terms of ohms resistance since calibration data were insufficient for conversion to percent moisture content.

40|$|Evaporation {{tests in}} {{concrete}} columns have been analysed by numerical models {{to characterize the}} thermo-hydraulic properties and the processes in concrete. Two evaporation tests were performed: a column heated by a lamp and a column kept in room conditions. The conceptual model considers unsaturated liquid flow and transport of vapour and energy. We also calculated models that {{take into account the}} dissolved salts to study its effect on vapour pressure and <b>evaporation.</b> A retention <b>curve</b> has been obtained from relative humidity and gravimetric water content measured after dismantling the tests. The models have been calibrated by adjusting the model's results to the measured data of water loss, relative humidity and temperature inside the concrete. The parameters obtained with the calibration are the permeability, thermal conductivity, boundary conditions and a tortuosity factor for vapour diffusion. Results show that the vapour diffusion is the dominant water transport process above an evaporation front, and liquid advection is dominant below it. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|Capillary {{evaporation}} Oscillating flows Critical {{heat flux}} Heat transfer a b s t r a c t Micromembrane-enhanced evaporating surfaces {{were developed to}} enhance capillary evaporation heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and critical heat flux (CHF). Micromembranes made of sintered single-layer cop-per mesh screen were diffusion bonded on microchannels to effectively promote capillary pressure and reduce flow resistance. Compared with mono-porous evaporating surfaces such as microchannels and copper woven mesh laminates in the same thickness under the similar working conditions, CHF was sub-stantially increased by 83 % and 198 %, respectively, because {{of the separation of}} the capillary pressure generation and fluid transport process that was enabled by the micromembrane. The major features such as ‘‘M’’-shaped capillary <b>evaporation</b> heat transfer <b>curves</b> and the associated heat transfer regions were identified. Oscillating flows induced by the bubble growth and collapse as well as the capillary flows induced by the receding menisci were observed and believed to play imperative roles in enhancing the heat transfer by inducing advections and improving evaporation and nucleate boiling. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{infiltration}} and {{redistribution of}} soil moisture under surface drip irrigation considering hysteresis were investigated in two soils (loamy {{sand and silt}} loam) of different texture. The effect of continuous versus intermittent application of 1, 2 and 4  l/h to the soils was evaluated in terms of wetting front advance patterns and deep percolation under the root zone. For this purpose, a cylindrical flow model incorporating hysteresis in the soil water retention characteristic <b>curve,</b> <b>evaporation</b> from the soil surface, and water extraction by roots was used. The results show that, compared with continuous irrigation, pulse irrigation slightly reduces the water losses under the root zone in both cases (with and without hysteresis). Also, at the total simulation time, in both types of irrigation, hysteresis reduces significantly the water losses under the root zone. Finally, the effect of hysteresis {{was found to be}} greater at higher discharge rate (4  l/h) and consequently at higher water content at the soil surface.
