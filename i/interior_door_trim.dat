40|$|Abstract: The {{significance}} of thermoplastic polyolefin polypropylene (PP) {{lies in its}} potential to replace polyvinyl chloride (PVC), {{the most widely used}} material for automobile <b>interiors</b> (<b>door</b> <b>trim,</b> dash board), which discharges harmful compounds in certain conditions. Another benefit of PP (0. 855 amorphous- 0. 946 crystalline g/cm 3) is its low density compared to that of PVC (1. 1 - 1. 45 g/cm 3), which reduces vehicle weight. Market demand for eco-friendly water-based adhesive/coating material is rising significantly as a substitute for solvent-based adhesive/coating material which emits VOC and causes harmful working conditions...|$|R

50|$|Early KB Centuras also {{experienced}} quality issues with <b>interior</b> fixtures, with <b>door</b> <b>trims</b> cracking, and torn vinyl trim near stitching lines not uncommon.

The saloon was only produced in Spain, and production ceased in 1992 due to disappointing sales.|$|R

50|$|The Gooding House and Tavern {{was under}} the {{ownership}} of Harry Gooding, George Gooding's grandson, when the significant 1917 alterations took place. At that time, Harry Gooding was continuing to farm the property. Ninety {{years had passed since}} his grandfather had first built a tavern here, and as many as 60 years had elapsed since the house had been expanded and perhaps updated. Much had changed in those years, including electrification and indoor plumbing, not to mention architectural tastes and styles. The Colonial Revival style was gaining popularity, along with the Arts and Crafts movement of the teens and twenties. Harry Gooding made a major investment in the home in 1916-1917, completely transforming the first floor with the addition of casement replacement windows, elaborate window and <b>door</b> <b>trim,</b> new exterior and <b>interior</b> <b>doors,</b> wall and ceiling paneling, new fireplace mantles, and built-in cupboards, casework and seating.
