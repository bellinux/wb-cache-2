40|$|Background: Acute {{exacerbations}} {{of chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (AeCOPD) are important causes of morbidity and mortality. In this study, we analyzed procalcitonin (PCT) levels in AeCOPD and stable period of COPD {{in order to}} evaluate usage of PCT in the prediction of the severity of AeCOPD, and its value on the planing of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). Materials and Methods: In this cross sectional study (2009 - 2010) 118 COPD patients were enrolled, 68 of them (58 %) were in acute exacerbations (case group). The others had stabile COPD and they were <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>control</b> <b>group.</b> Results: In case group the mean levels of PCT (0. 19 ± 0. 02) C-Reactive Protein (44. 7 ± 5. 92), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (28. 4 ± 2. 65), white blood cell (9. 4 ± 0. 43) and %neutrophils (69. 9 ± 1. 22) were significantly higher than controls (P = 0. 0001). There was no difference between PCT levels based on stages of COPD. There were significiant differences in mean PCT levels according to type and severity of AeCOPD. Mean PCT level in hospitalized patients receiving NPPV was 0. 36 ng/ml, while it was 0. 15 ng/ml for those treated without NPPV (P = 0. 0001). PCT cut-off value for NPPV indication was determined to be 0. 10 ng/ml. Conclusions: PCT levels were found to be higher in AeCOPD patients than in stable COPD patients, as expected. Also mean PCT levels increased especially in cases with severe AeCOPD and those receiving NPPV among them.

Various parameters pertaining to existence or removal of parasites from blood as well as survival or death and the experimental animals have been recorded with respect to the drug given alone singular or in combination. Liver impression smears indicated parasitaemia in the different experimental groups. A number of clinical signs were observed in goats in different groups with respect to hypothermia and various manifestations and thriftiness or posture and state of health. Post treatment all goats dosed with Cymelarsan showed swelling at injection site which disappeared after 1 - 2 days in a few goats but never in other majority of the groups. Severity of the clinical signs developed with the high dosing of the drugs. Some goats showed decrease in body temperature, respiratory rate, pulse rate, body weight and blood pressure, others showed severe signs, including lacrimation, nasal discharge, shivering, and pyrexia, loss of appetite, keratitis, diarrhoea, weak respiration and pulse rate. Some camels exhibited crying sounds Pharmacotoxicity of some trypanocidal drugs in food animals (Nubian goats and camels) and restlessness with episodes of diarrhoea whereas in goats most prevalent lesions were congestion, oedema and haemorrhage and frothing at the mouth plus necrosis of livers and kidneys in addition to nephritis, gastritis, enteritis, peritonitis and hydroperitoneum, spleenomegaly, and orchitis post infection.

Methods: We conducted a nonrandomized retrospective clinical trial involving 55 patients with refractory SSNHL. For 21 patients (the perfusion group), DXM (2. 5 mg/ 0. 5 ml) was perfused transtympanically through a round window catheter using an infusion pump for 1 h twice a day for 7 d giving a total amount of 35. 0 mg. For 23 patients (the injection group), DXM (2. 5 mg/time) was injected by tympanic membrane puncture at intervals of 2 d on a total of four occasions giving a total amount of 10. 0 mg. For 11 patients (the drip group), DXM (2. 5 mg/ 0. 5 ml) was dripped via a ventilation tube placed by myringotomy, once on the first day and twice a day for the remaining 6 d giving a total amount of 32. 5 mg. Thirty-two patients with refractory SSNHL who refused to undertake further treatments were <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> the <b>control</b> <b>group.</b> Hearing recovery and complications were compared among the groups. Hearing results were evaluated based on a four-frequency (0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, 4. 0 kHz) pure tone average (PTA). Results: Post-treatment audiograms were obtained one month after treatments were completed. The improvements in average PTA for the perfusion, injection, and drip groups were 9. 0, 8. 6, and 1. 7 dB, respectively. Hearing improvement was significantly greater in the perfusion and injection groups than in the <b>control</b> <b>group</b> (1. 4 dB) (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Operative therapy of {{degenerative}} instable spinal diseases often {{includes a}} fusion of the affected spinal segment. This leads to a relief of pain but also {{to a loss of}} the segmental function. The resulting overcharge of the adjacent segment may cause a adjacent segment degeneration. Fusion does not treat the causal degenerative processes of the affected segment. The concept of dorsal dynamic stabilization for a therapy of degenerative spinal diseases includes the stabilization of the spinal segment and concurrent a preservation of the spinal function. Thus the degenerative cascade shall be stopped. Previous systems nearly solely have been investigated biomechanical in vitro. Valid data of the biomechanical behavior after in vivo exploration are missing. Therefore it was the aim of this study to characterize the biomechanical properties of a posterior dynamic stabilization system (PDSS) after one year in vivo. 40 sheep of were randomized and distributed into the group A and B. All sheep underwent a nucleotomy of the segment L 3 / 4 to induce disc degeneration. Following the segments L 3 / 4 of the animals of group B were stabilized with the PDSS. Group A was <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> the <b>control</b> <b>group,</b> so no second operation was done. After 12 respectively 48 weeks 10 sheep of every group underwent euthanasia, preparation and biomechanical investigation of the segments L 3 / 4 and L 2 / 3. Neutral Zone (NZ) and Range Of Motion (ROM) were measured bidirectional for flexion/extension, lateral bending and rotation. The segments of group B were tested again after explantation of the PDSS. For comparison biomechanical data of a native segment and a segment after in vitro nucleotomy were available. The PDSS group (group A) showed in the most measurements after 12 and 48 weeks significant less results in comparison to the nucleotomy- group (group B), only the NZ after 48 weeks of the lateral bending and rotation showed no significant differences. All measured deflections of group A, except for the NZ of the lateral bending after 48 weeks, presented results, which were significant less than the deflection of a native segment. The significant difference in comparison to a native segment remained after removal of the PDSS. The results substantiate, that the PDSS is able to stabilize an instable segment. But no physiological movement is achieved. Also clues of a positive influence on the generative process are missing. For that reason the tested system can not comply with the requirements. The biomechanical characteristics resemble a rigid stabilization. Further investigations are needed to develop a dynamic stabilization system which guarantees the function with concurrent stabilization of the segment...|$|R

The average of weight gain was 509 ± 0. 40 g/d. Cell count showed 16059. 96 leukocytes by mm 3. Hemoglobin showed value of 12. 11 g/dl ± 2. 8 whereas the hematocrit had a value of 38. 40 % ± 7. 6 and the corpuscular hemoglobin concentration showed a mean value of 31. 62 % ± 4. 7. Serum protein showed a mean value of 5. 55 g/dl ± 0. 7 and the serum iron mean value was 18. 70 μmol/L ± 11. 8. Statistical analysis of variance showed that the month factor sampling and the breed factor of all analyzed metabolites showed significant differences for serum levels, whereas the treatment factor of showed statistical differences only mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration values...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{bactericidal}} {{efficacy of}} aminoglycosides {{is directly related}} to peak serum concentration (Cmax), particularly the first one. Transitory high concentrations of aminoglycosides do not result in such a high drug uptake by renal and cochlear tissues because of the saturation of cell binding sites. These observations have led to the concept that less frequent administration of relatively larger doses of aminoglycosides would be of interest in treating infectious diseases. OBJECTIVE: Prospective evaluation of a dosing chart of amikacin (Ak) in high-risk neonates suspected of infection within the first 2 days of life. This dosing chart was based on a previous pharmacokinetic population study published elsewhere, treated accordingly to the new once-daily concept of aminoglycoside administration. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred and seventy-seven neonates (69 females and 108 males; mean gestational age (GA +/-SD: 33. 6 +/- 4. 1 weeks (W) received Ak regimen dosage according to the following dosing chart: Group (Gr) 1 a GA /= 37 W: 15. 5 mg/kg/ 24 h. In case of asphyxia, hypoxic episode and intercourse treatment with indomethacin, the interval was systemically increased by 6 h whatever the GA groups. The mean duration time of Ak treatment (+/- 1 SD) was 5. 00 +/- 2. 01 days (range 2 - 13). Ak serum concentrations 1 h after completion of 30 min infusion (C 1 h), and successive Ak serum concentrations just before next administration depending on the difference of interval between each group (so defined minimum serum concentration (Cmin)), were determined in each neonate. Creatininemia during the fist postnatal weeks was used as an index of glomerular filtration rate; brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BEAPs) were used in 139 babies when reaching a postconceptional age of >/= 36 weeks to assess possible ototoxicity, and were compared to values from a group of term and a group of preterm babies, previously <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> our reference <b>control</b> <b>groups.</b> RESULTS: At day 1 of treatment, there was no correlation between the Ak C 1 hS and the GA at birth (mean 27. 8 +/- 5. 21 microgram/ml (+/- 1 SD); median 28; r = - 0. 003; range 10 - 40). In the same way, there was no correlation between the first Ak CminS and the GA at birth (mean 3. 7 +/- 2. 0 microgram/ml (+/- 1 SD); median 3. 0; r = - 0. 33; range 0 - 10). The lack of correlation between these first observed C 1 hS and CminS and the GA at birth suggests the validity of our previous established dose regimen recommendations. Analyzing the data between groups, the mean value +/- 1 SD of Ak C 1 hS at day 1 of treatment was not significantly different (p > 0. 05). Concerning the first Ak CminS, a significant difference (p 0. 05) between the treated groups (preterm group and term group) and the corresponding <b>control</b> <b>groups.</b> While the primary aim of the study was not to test the bactericidal efficacy of this new regimen, the recovery was excellent in 37 babies with proven or highly suspected infectious disease, except in 1 of them who died from septic shock (group B Streptococcus). After 5 years of using this kind of Ak administration in the unit, minimal inhibitory concentration profiles tested in 43 successive bacterial strains collected from inborn patients remained adequate.
