However he later became better known as a director, with films such as Whistle Down the Wind (1961), The L-Shaped Room (1962) and The Stepford Wives (1975) among his best-known credits. Forbes later recalled of the film: “I {{was one of the people}} attacked by the alien pods. This pod exploded and <b>I</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> what was supposed to be a terrible alien growth on my face. Come lunchtime and we all went off to the pub. Of course, I couldn't take this stuff off, the makeup was too complex; the landlord refused to serve me.” ...|$|E

Disliked because of his pranks ("which I for one found spirited"), he was moved to the 7th Artillery Regiment in Călărași, and, because once there he complained about the mistreatment of regulars by the officers, spent several months in the disciplinary barracks. He notes: [...] "Just as I was ending my term as a volunteer, the captain, having learned that I had donned a civilian's outfit for a private party, ordered me in lockdown.—Lockdown meant no stove and no windows, so that's how <b>I</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> pneumonia." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I wrote a quick script which I was not {{particularly}} enamored with myself," [...] Hill said. However it attracted the interest of Paul Newman and John Huston. [...] "One {{would like to think}} you are mistaken about the wonders of your work, but I didn't believe it," [...] he said. [...] "That part turned out to be true. I went over to work on the script with Huston. He wasn't very well, <b>I</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> sole screen credit, but {{one of the problems is}} the screen credit is misleading very often. I wrote 90% of the first half, various people wrote the rest. I didn't think it was a very good film. Hill says he never saw the final product, but was told it was [...] "a real bomb".|$|E

I think painting is, as well, a symbolic and allegorical situation {{that happens to be}} made by a particular medium and set of materials. And really as a painter I've tried to put pressure on what a painting is and rethink it in different ways. And that's how <b>I</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> such different ways of looking at various possibilities, especially in terms of abstract painting." ...|$|R
2500|$|On August 1, 1969, {{three letters}} {{prepared}} by the killer were received at the Vallejo Times Herald, the San Francisco Chronicle, and The San Francisco Examiner.

So I have piles of semi-transparent drawings all layered on top of each other in my studio and they form a kind of tunnel of information. Out of that, you can pull this form that turns into the sculpture or the painting. It's literally like pulling the narrative out of overlaying all of the structures. That's how <b>I</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> this structure. It's derived from a series of drawings that I scan into the computer and refine through various processes...and send to the sheet-metal shop down the road where it's cut out of metal and assembled into larger structures which are too big for my studio.|$|R

40|$|Some {{years ago}} I did {{a fair amount}} of work on whether Britain should join the euro, {{in the context of the}} debate on the ‘five tests’ set out by HM Treasury. Five years on it is an {{interesting}} issue to revisit, particularly in the light of the recent banking crisis. In what follows I discuss the potential benefits and costs for the United Kingdom of joining the euro or Economic and Monetary Union, EMU, in much the terms that I did five years ago, because the essential figures and arguments have not changed. This discussion carries no particular implications for other countries: the calculations are highly specific to the United Kingdom. <b>I</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> an effort to put this discussion in the context of the recent crisis...|$|R
40|$|Considering {{the notions}} of “lack”, “excess” and “strangeness”, from the {{perspective}} of materialist discourse analysis, I sustain that those three elements are constitutive of the construction process of a methodological framework that considers the prosodic materiality of the voice to be significant. I present the construction of a discursive object of research in which I intend to analyze the discourse of the Minister-Rapporteur during the trial of the “Mensalão” by the Brazilian Supreme Court. I also show how, from the first file reading and listening gestures, <b>I</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the “reported speech” as the regularity of that discourse, marked by the presence of another in the linguistic linearity. In conclusion, I discuss three concerns during the construction of the framework: the transcript of the speech of the Minister audios; the status given to the “reported speech” in the research; and the balance between horizontal exhaustiveness and vertical exhaustiveness...|$|R
40|$|Concepts of {{identity}}, identity formation, identity politics, {{and collective}} identity, despite being vague, {{are among the}} most used notions in social theory, historical analysis, and everyday life and politics. In {{the last four or five}} decades “identity” has become a catchword that could explain almost any political or cultural development. In this paper, I discuss existential and social dimensions of identity and identity formation, decode the relational and historical conditions of their construction and argue that identities at any given point of time represent a general (albeit multiple) and fragmented expression of human’s capacity. I further contend that identity is a social relation: an embodiment of power structures and power discourses. <b>I</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> some reflections on how we can imagine communities compatible with human emancipation by replacing the particularity of identity with the universalism of humanity and focusing on humanity and discourses of human emancipation. This paper reconstructs the “identity debate” as a part of a conceptual deliberation of the narrative of historical change...|$|R

40|$|This article explores {{approaches}} about curriculum {{history in}} Spain {{over the use}} the field concept. This discussion have been present in the History of Education around the last years.

This methodological tool has been useful for analyze and explain the continuities and changes in curriculum policy and school subjects. The nature of the contribution of this concept to the study of curriculum change is assessed. The paper try to explain the different problems about the use of field concept within History of Education in Spain. First, I describe the discussion in Spain around this approach.

40|$|Is Friedrich von Hayek in some specific, perhaps paradoxical, way a "classical liberal paternalist"? My {{answer will}} be an unsatisfying "yes and no" {{depending}} not only on my interpretation of Hayek, {{but also on the}} manifold interpretations one can give to the concepts of paternalism and classical liberalism (or, indeed: liberty). I start with an interpretation of Hayek’s account of "modernity". Here, I hint at a first potential paradox {{in the form of a}} "magic triangle" composed of (a) Hayek’s praise and explanation of the evolutionary emergence of the spontaneous order of the market and civil society, (b) Hayek’s fierce opposition to modernist thinking and the fatal conceit of rationalist constructivism and (c) Hayek’s gloomy visions of politics, legislation, or public choice. Next, I shortly distinguish various dimensions of paternalism and confront these with Hayek’s classical liberalism. In the following parts, I offer a brief account of behavioral "anomalies" of public choices that are analogous to, and even more harmful than, those used as legitimizations of "libertarian paternalism" in the private realm. <b>I</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a qualified claim that at least in the realm of potentially self-damaging collective choices, Hayek might be called a (classical liberal) "paternalist". ...|$|R
