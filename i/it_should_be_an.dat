'Circles' doesn't seem to know what kind of song it wants it to be, so it settles for two not very good ones".|$|E

The Fédération Cynologique Internationale standard for the Jack Russell terrier has this smaller size listed as a requirement.

Treadwell-Collins left on 6 May and O'Connor's first credited episode was broadcast on 11 July Although O'Connor's first credited episode aired in July, his own creative work was not seen onscreen until late September. Additionally, Oliver Kent was brought in as the Head of Continuing Drama Series for BBC Scripted Studios, meaning that Kent would oversee EastEnders along with O'Connor. O'Connor's approach to the show {{was to have a}} firmer focus on realism, which he said was being [...] "true to EastEnders DNA and [...] a way of capturing {{what it would be like}} if Julia Smith and Tony Holland were making the show now." [...] He said that [...] "EastEnders has always had a distinctly different tone from the other soaps but over time we've diluted our unique selling point. I think we need to be ourselves and go back to the origins of the show and what made it successful in the first place. It should be entertaining but it should also be informative—that's part of our unique BBC compact with the audience. It shouldn't just be a distraction from your own life, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> exploration of the life shared by the audience and the characters." [...] O'Connor planned to stay with EastEnders until the end of 2017, but announced his departure on 23 June 2017 with immediate effect, saying he wanted to concentrate on a career in film. John Yorke returned as a temporary creative director. Kent said, [...] "John Yorke is a Walford legend and I am thrilled that he will be joining us for a short period to oversee the show and to help us build on Sean's legacy while we recruit a long-term successor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the growing}} {{collective}} of organizers, {{differences of opinion}} and direction arose concerning the planned public event. VVAW leaders felt <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> all-veteran event, to maintain its credibility. Less than three months into planning for the Winter Soldier Investigation, most of the Vietnam veteran organizers and Jeremy Rifkin had become adamant that WSI disassociate itself from Mark Lane. CCI staffers criticized Lane as being arrogant and sensationalistic, and said the book he was writing had [...] "shoddy reporting in it." [...] The CCI leaders refused to work with Lane further and gave the VVAW leaders a [...] "Lane or us" [...] ultimatum. VVAW {{did not want to}} lose the monetary support of Lane and Fonda, so the CCI split from the project. The following month, after caustic reviews of Lane's book by authors and a Vietnam expert, VVAW would also distance itself from Lane just one month before the event. [...] Lane had recently published a book, Conversations with Americans, in which Lane relied on unverified interviews with thirty three servicemen, four of whom were later exposed as unreliable by Neil Sheehan in a New York Times book review. Leaders of VVAW feared involvement with Lane would tarnish the credibility of the WSI. [...] A new steering committee was created without Lane, but he was allowed to continue with fundraising events and was available for legal counsel. [...] The new six-member steering committee for WSI was composed of three national office leaders (Al Hubbard, Craig Scott Moore, and Mike Oliver) and three members of the growing list of chapters (Art Flesch, Tim Butz, and William F. Crandell). Organizers hoped Lane would keep a low profile during the event, and he did, as he spent his time flying around the country defending his book. [...] Ultimately, the WSI was an event produced by veterans only, without the need of [...] "so-called experts" [...] such as Lane and Fonda.|$|E
