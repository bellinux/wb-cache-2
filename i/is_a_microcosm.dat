5|$|Jim Martin, {{positioned}} {{in the lower}} right, gives a coy and perhaps mischievous glance back at the viewer. He <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> of the entire scene in which no one appears to be giving thanks in a traditional manner of a Thanksgiving dinner. Solomon finds it a departure from previous depictions of Thanksgiving in that the participants do not lower their heads or raise their hands in the traditional poses of prayer. She sees it {{as an example of}} treating American traditions in both sanctified and casual ways. Theologian David Brown sees gratitude as implicit in the painting, while Kenneth Bendiner writes that Rockwell was mindful of the Last Supper and that the painting's perspective echoes its rendition by Tintoretto.|$|E
5|$|There {{was much}} consternation {{when it was}} {{demolished}} in 1989, after Mayor Richard M. Daley approved its demolition to erect a multi-use skyscraper with retail, hotel, office, and residential spaces. The McCarthy Building, a Chicago Landmark, was even stripped of landmark status over the objection of preservationists and public interest groups {{in order for the}} block to be cleared. Due to Block 37's central location in the Loop, between the State Street retail district, the city/county government complex, and the Randolph Street theater district, its history <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> of the city's history. Block 37 was a nearly vacant city block from 1989 until 2005 after several attempts at redevelopment failed due to Chicago politics and insufficient funding of several past developers. The single remaining building from the pre-1989 Block 37 architecture is an active Commonwealth Edison transformer building that distributes power to a great portion of the Loop.|$|E

5000|$|Heterotopia can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> single real {{place that}} juxtaposes several spaces. <b>A</b> garden can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> heterotopia, if it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> real space meant to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> of {{different}} environments, with plants {{from around the}} world.|$|R

25|$|The Olmstead Street Historic District {{is located}} along two blocks of that street in Cohoes, New York, United States. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> of the city's economy {{at its peak}} in the mid- to late 19th century, {{consisting}} of a former textile mill complex, a filled-in section of the original Erie Canal, and three long blocks of row houses built for the millworkers.|$|E
25|$|In the film, Max {{periodically}} plays Go {{with his}} mentor, Sol. This game has historically stimulated {{the study of}} mathematics and features a simple set of rules that results in a complex game strategy. The two characters each use the game {{as a model for}} their view of the universe; Sol says that the game <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> of an extremely complex and chaotic world, while Max asserts its complexity gradually converges toward patterns that can be found.|$|E
25|$|In October 2010, The Forward {{reported}} on {{the current state of}} Jews and the level of antisemitism in Sweden. Henrik Bachner, a writer and {{professor of history at the}} University of Lund, stated that members of the Swedish Riksdag have attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved, and the rhetoric was often antisemitic—not just anti-Israel. Charles Small, former director of the Yale University Initiative for the Study of Anti-Semitism, stated that “Sweden <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> of contemporary anti-Semitism. It’s a form of acquiescence to radical Islam, which is diametrically opposed to everything Sweden stands for.” Per Gudmundson, chief editorial writer for Svenska Dagbladet and well known for his pro-Israeli stance for decades, has sharply criticised politicians who he says offer “weak excuses” for Muslims accused of antisemitic crimes. “Politicians say these kids are poor and oppressed, and we have made them hate. They are, in effect, saying that the behaviour of these kids is in some way our fault.” Much of the anti-semitism in the country has been attributed to the growing Muslim immigrant population.|$|E

50|$|The Removalists <b>is</b> <b>a</b> play {{written by}} Australian playwright David Williamson in 1971.

500|$|Dhaka ( [...] , [...] or [...] ) is {{the capital}} and largest city of Bangladesh. The name {{of the city was}} spelled as Dacca, which was an anglicisation name until the current {{spelling}} was adopted in 1983 to match with Bengali pronunciation. Located in an eponymous district and division, it lies along the east bank of the Buriganga River {{in the heart of the}} Bengal delta. The city <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> of the entire country, with diverse religious and ethnic communities. Dhaka is the economic, cultural and political center of Bangladesh. [...] It is a major financial center of South Asia. It is one of the world's most populated cities and within OIC countries, with a population of 18.89 million people in the Greater Dhaka Area., It is also the 4th most densely populated city in the world.|$|E
500|$|Despite his influence, Patiño is {{frequently}} {{the victim of}} the Supreme's abuse, even having his own death sentence dictated to him, although in the end he outlives his master. González Echevarría questions whether Patiño [...] " [...] the last laugh? Did he achieve some sort of posthumous power?" [...] This is suggested both because he outlived Dr. Francia, and also because the pen ostensibly used to write the book was given to the author by Patiño's descendant. Therefore, [...] "the editor, who arranges the various texts and annotates them, who thereby exercises final authority over Dr. Francia's versions of himself, is the heir of Policarpo Patiño." [...] The power relationship between the Supreme and his secretary <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> of the book as a whole, with Dr. Francia dominating Patiño completely, even though the latter is intimately associated with the dictator having power at all, given the power he derives from writing.|$|E
500|$|Presley was {{a central}} figure in the {{development}} of rockabilly, according to music historians. Katherine Charlton even calls him [...] "rockabilly's originator", though Carl Perkins has explicitly stated that [...] " [...] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn't create rockabilly." [...] and, according to Michael Campbell, [...] "Bill Haley recorded the first big rockabilly hit." [...] "It had been there for quite a while", says Scotty Moore. [...] "Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around Jackson, and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old." [...] However, [...] "Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley's first release, on the Sun label", writes Craig Morrison. Paul Friedlander describes the defining elements of rockabilly, which he similarly characterizes as [...] "essentially... an Elvis Presley construction": [...] "the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [...] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [...] country". In [...] "That's All Right", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, [...] "a combination of Merle Travis–style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> of this fusion." ...|$|E
50|$|Sagaing, {{like its}} bigger cousin Pinya, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> of the fractious small kingdoms period (1287-1555).

50|$|Texas {{had about}} 20,000 German Americans in the 1850s. They did not form a uniform bloc, but were highly diverse and drew from {{geographic}} areas and {{all sectors of}} European society, except that very few aristocrats or upper middle class businessmen arrived.

2500|$|The subtle bodies, {{and their}} {{associated}} planes of existence, form {{an essential part}} of the esoteric systems that deal with astral phenomena. In the neo-platonism of Plotinus, for example, the individual <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> ("small world") of the universe (the macrocosm or [...] "great world"). [...] "The rational soul...is akin to the great Soul of the World" [...] while [...] "the material universe, like the body, is made as a faded image of the Intelligible". Each succeeding plane of manifestation is causal to the next, a world-view called emanationism; [...] "from the One proceeds Intellect, from Intellect Soul, and from Soul - in its lower phase, or that of Nature - the material universe".|$|E
2500|$|The {{culture of}} Belfast, {{much like the}} city, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> {{of the culture of}} Northern Ireland. Hilary McGrady, chief {{executive}} of Imagine Belfast, claimed that [...] "Belfast has begun a social, economic and cultural transformation that has the potential to reverberate across Europe." [...] Belfast is split between two distinct vibrant cultural communities simply described as Catholic and Protestant both of which have made their own contributions to the city's culture. Throughout the troubles, Belfast continued to express itself through art and music. Today, it has a growing international cultural reputation as both communities move into the future and prove the relevance of art in education and healthcare environments as well as using it to heal the divisions of the past and promote social growth for the future.|$|E
2500|$|... "Morrowland", {{where the}} story begins, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> of early modern society, with a king, a burgher, a merchant, and a worker. The novel and its sequel take place roughly in the 20th century, but have anachronistic elements. China {{is still an}} empire, Native American Indians and Eskimos still live in {{traditional}} ways, yet there are ocean liners, telephones, a postal service, chewing gum and other modern conveniences. There are many fictional locations, like the [...] "Crown of the World", a vast mountain range coloured in red and white stripes, and the [...] "Magnetic Cliffs". Some locations are based on real places, such as the Himalayas, and legendary ones, such as the magnetic cliffs in the Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor and a beautiful abandoned city under the sea, patterned after Atlantis. China is depicted in a phantasmic way; in later German editions, the country name was changed to Mandala.|$|E

2500|$|Satir's entire {{work was}} done under the {{umbrella}} of [...] "Becoming More Fully Human". From the possibility of a nurturing primary triad of father, mother, and child she conceived a process of Human Validation. She continually planted the seeds of hope toward world peace. As she said (Align, 1988, p.20): [...] "The family <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm.</b> By knowing how to heal the family, I know how to heal the world." [...] With this overview she established professional training groups in the Satir Model in the Middle East, the Orient, Western and Eastern Europe, Central and Latin America, and Russia. The Institute for International Connections, Avanta Network, and the International Human Learning Resources Network are concrete examples of teaching people how to connect with one another and then extend the connections. Her world impact could be summed up in her universal mantra: peace within, peace between, peace among.|$|E
2500|$|Tarzan {{is a white}} European {{male who}} grows up with apes. According to [...] "Taking Tarzan Seriously" [...] by Marianna Torgovnick, Tarzan is {{confused}} with the social hierarchy {{that he is a}} part of. Unlike everyone else in his society, Tarzan {{is the only one who}} is not clearly part of any social group. All the other members of his world are not able to climb or decline socially because they are already part of a social hierarchy which is stagnant. Turgovnick writes that since Tarzan was raised as an ape, he thinks and acts like an ape. However, instinctively he is human and he resorts to being human when he is pushed to. The reason of his confusion is that he does not understand what the typical white male is supposed to act like. His instincts eventually kick in when he is in the midst of this confusion, and he ends up dominating the jungle. In Tarzan, the jungle <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>microcosm</b> for the world in general in 1912 to the early 1930s. His climbing of the social hierarchy proves that the European white male is the most dominant of all races/sexes, no matter what the circumstance. Furthermore, Turgovnick writes that when Tarzan first meets Jane, she is slightly repulsed but also fascinated by his animal-like actions. As the story progresses, Tarzan surrenders his knife to Jane in an oddly chivalrous gesture, which makes Jane fall for Tarzan despite his odd circumstances. Turgovnick believes that this displays an instinctual, civilized chivalry that Burrough believes is common in white men.|$|E

Popinski, who found refuge in Malmö in 1945, stated that, until recently, she told her story in Malmö schools as part of their Holocaust studies program, but that now, many schools no longer ask Holocaust survivors to tell their stories, because Muslim students treat them with such disrespect, either ignoring the speakers or walking out of the class. She further stated, [...] "Malmö reminds me of the anti-Semitism I felt as a child in Poland before the war. [...] "I am not safe as a Jew in Sweden anymore." ...|$|E
