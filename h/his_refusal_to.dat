5|$|In {{stories of}} higher caste Hindus (especially Brahmins), Nandanar is a Brahmin or God himself somehow {{trapped in the}} body of an {{untouchable}} and whose true form is revealed by the fire trial. Other tales focus on his strict adherence to caste norms, his obedience of his Brahmin master and <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> enter the holy temple as an untouchable.|$|E
5|$|A seizure {{does not}} occur just because the {{government}} questions an individual in a public place. The exclusionary rule would not bar voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution. The person is not being seized if his freedom of movement is not restrained. The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds, with few exceptions. <b>His</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> accept {{anything}} short of total victory was pivotal in the final outcome. His tenacity was well-paid {{with the news that}} López had died in battle on 1 March 1870, bringing the war to a close. PedroII turned down the General Assembly's suggestion to erect an equestrian statue of him to commemorate the victory and chose instead to use the money to build elementary schools.|$|E

5|$|Morehead {{returned}} {{to his home in}} Louisville, but feared <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> take an oath of allegiance to the Constitution would lead to another arrest. In June 1862, he fled to Canada, then to Europe, and finally to Mexico. Following the war, Morehead {{returned to}} the United States and lived on his plantation in Greenville, Mississippi. He died there on December 21, 1868 and was buried on the grounds. On May 31, 1879, he was reburied in the Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Whale was {{openly gay}} {{throughout}} his career, {{something that was}} very unusual in the 1920s and 1930s. As knowledge of his sexual orientation has become more common, some of his films, Bride of Frankenstein in particular, have been interpreted as having a gay subtext {{and it has been}} claimed that <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> remain in the closet led {{to the end of his}} career.|$|E
5|$|After his accession, Diocletian and Lucius Caesonius Bassus {{were named}} as consuls and assumed the fasces {{in place of}} Carinus and Numerianus. Bassus {{was a member of}} a senatorial family from Campania, a former consul and proconsul of Africa, chosen by Probus for signal distinction. He was skilled in areas of {{government}} where Diocletian presumably had no experience. Diocletian's elevation of Bassus as consul symbolized his rejection of Carinus' government in Rome, <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> accept second-tier status to any other emperor, and his willingness to continue the long-standing collaboration between the empire's senatorial and military aristocracies. It also tied his success to that of the Senate, whose support he would need in his advance on Rome.|$|E

50|$|During {{his time}} as German Minister of Finance, he became the second-most {{powerful}} man in federal politics. He {{was known for his}} tight fiscal policies, aimed at keeping the German currency stable. In this role, he strongly resisted any reparation claims to victims of the Nazi reign. After German rearmament, Schäffer was engaged in many arguments about defense spending, often irritating his NATO partners by <b>his</b> <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> allocate more money to it.|$|R
5|$|As {{they travel}} together, Natalie {{questions}} Ryan's philosophies on life, particularly on relationships and love, but Ryan is adamant {{that he is}} more than happy with his lifestyle. During the trip, Natalie is shattered when her boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by text message, and Ryan and Alex try to comfort her. Natalie later lectures Ryan about <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> consider a commitment to Alex {{in spite of their}} obvious compatibility, and becomes infuriated; she apologizes later, but soon afterward they are both ordered back to Omaha to implement Natalie's program. On the test run, the earlier concerns Ryan raised prove valid; one laid-off person breaks down in tears before the camera, and Natalie is unable to comfort him.|$|E
5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue {{at the heart of}} the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E
5|$|At {{this stage}} of the war, Braithwaite, a popular commander, was {{temporarily}} in charge of the division while Russell was on leave. The last of the brigade commanders who had embarked with the NZEF in 1914, he was worn out and in January was evacuated to England for treatment. On recovery, Braithwaite rejoined his original British Army regiment rather than returning to the division. There were rumours amongst the soldiers of the division that this was a punishment for <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> carry on with the 12 October attack at Passchendaele.|$|E

5|$|Culverhouse was {{initially}} lauded for bringing professional football to the Tampa Bay area, but eventually {{came to be}} blamed for the team's struggles. <b>His</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> pay Doug Williams at a salary level {{comparable to that of}} the league's top quarterbacks insulted fans, and was seen as the beginning of the team's decline during the 1980s. It further led to the belief that Culverhouse was unconcerned with fielding a winning team, {{as long as it was}} financially profitable. The Buccaneers' NFL-record streak of fourteen consecutive losing seasons cemented this perception, although Culverhouse did make several notable attempts to improve the team.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{reportedly}} saw {{the poll}} {{as an opportunity}} to legitimise him as a symbol of Vietnamese democracy, so that he could frame and justify <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> participate in national elections as a struggle between freedom and communist authoritarianism. Diệm asserted that South Vietnam would eventually reunify the nation under a democratic administration and liberate their northern compatriots from communist oppression, and championed the referendum as a first step in nurturing democracy. His support base was to use this as a means of justifying the deposal of Bảo Đại, citing past decisions that according to them, were pro-communist.|$|E
5|$|During these years, Harrison {{exhibited}} {{a number of}} personality quirks that became legendary. One was his habit of calling in subordinates to dine {{with him in the}} executive dining room by sending them a blue chip that had the meal's conversational topic written on it. Usually the topics were intellectual rather than related to the running of the railroad. Another oddity was <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> use his railroad pass, which entitled him to free travel. Instead, he personally paid for his commute between his home and the railroad's offices.|$|E

50|$|Tobin {{begins to}} attract {{attention}} form the other boys, with <b>his</b> <b>refusals</b> <b>to</b> join them in the brothels and his stunted growth. However, he proves himself in battle against brigands, rallying the Companions to him, while Prince Korin freezes {{in the heat of}} battle. Pregnant again, Aliya gives birth to a dead, hideously deformed child without face or legs, Niryn's work (which he quickly blames on the renegade wizards). Lady Aliya then dies in the birth, along with the child, destroying Prince Korin's royal line.|$|R
6000|$|The vicomte {{smiled at}} this {{characteristic}} manifestation of good-will and courtesy; and after pausing an instant {{to choose an}} expression <b>to</b> soften <b>his</b> <b>refusal,</b> and <b>to</b> express <b>his</b> own sense of the motive of the invitation, he called out-- ...|$|R
5|$|He {{was moved}} to the Bureau of Topography of the Committee of Public Safety and sought unsuccessfully to be {{transferred}} to Constantinople in order to offer his services to the Sultan. During this period, he wrote the romantic novella Clisson et Eugénie, about a soldier and his lover, in a clear parallel to Bonaparte's own relationship with Désirée. On 15 September, Bonaparte was removed from the list of generals in regular service for <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> serve in the Vendée campaign. He faced a difficult financial situation and reduced career prospects.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, {{when the}} new {{communist}} regime outlawed the Greek-Catholic Church and forcibly merged it into the Orthodox Church, Agârbiceanu refused to join the latter denomination, thus setting himself up against the authorities. However, these found {{his reputation as a}} writer valuable for their own interests, and preferred to try and co-opt him. In 1953, after a five-year marginalization for <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> turn Orthodox, Agârbiceanu joined the editorial board of Anatol E. Baconsky's semi-official literary magazine, Steaua. He was granted the Order of Labor the following year, and promoted to titular member of the Academy in 1955. On the occasion of his 80th birthday in 1962, he was also awarded the Order of the Star of the Romanian People's Republic, first class.|$|E
5|$|James Maurice Kilburn (8 July 1909 – 28 August 1993) was a British sports {{journalist}} who {{wrote for the}} Yorkshire Post between 1934 and 1976. Well-regarded for the style of his writing and <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> write about off-field events, Kilburn wrote primarily about Yorkshire County Cricket Club. After a brief career in teaching, and having spent time in Finland, Kilburn was appointed cricket correspondent at the Yorkshire Post after impressing the editor with his writing. A serious man, he had an unusual way of writing his reports, but his editors refused to change his copy, so highly did they value his impact.|$|E
2500|$|Getty defended <b>his</b> initial <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> pay {{the ransom}} on two points. First, {{he argued that}} {{to submit to the}} kidnappers' demands would {{immediately}} place his other fourteen grandchildren at the risk of copy-cat kidnappers. He added: ...|$|R
50|$|That he was {{appointed}} Attorney-General for Ireland despite {{his opposition to the}} Union and <b>his</b> repeated <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> stand for the post-Union Parliament is a tribute to his legal eminence (although Daniel O'Connell inevitably accused him of political time-serving).|$|R
5000|$|Katan {{was arrested}} by the Germans in July 1942, ostensibly due to his and <b>his</b> family's <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> wear the Jewish star the Nazis {{required}} Jews to wear on their clothing. His wife and son were arrested soon afterwards.|$|R
5|$|Jobs rants to {{marketing}} executive Joanna Hoffman about a Time magazine article exposing his paternity dispute with ex-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan – he denies {{he is the}} father of Brennan's five-year-old daughter, Lisa. Brennan arrives with Lisa to confront him – she is bitter over his denials and <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> support her despite his wealth. Jobs bonds with Lisa over her MacPaint art and agrees to provide more money and a house. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak asks Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II team in his presentation, but Jobs feels that mentioning the computer (which he considers obsolete) is unwise.|$|E
5|$|Knott was disbarred {{and briefly}} imprisoned for <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> {{take the oath}} of allegiance. He {{returned}} to Kentucky in 1863 and {{was elected to the}} U.S. House of Representatives. In 1871, he made a notable speech ridiculing a bill to subsidize westward expansion of railroads. In the speech, he lampooned the remote town of Duluth, Minnesota. The Duluth speech was eventually reprinted in several publications and brought Knott national acclaim. He did not stand for re-election in 1870, instead making a failed run for the office of governor. In 1875, he returned to the House and served as chair of the judiciary committee.|$|E
5|$|On September 20, 2007, federal {{prosecutors}} charged the Jew with {{one count of}} mail fraud in connection with extorting $80,000 from Quickly. Jew denied any wrongdoing. He questioned what influence he could have over the issuing of permits, and reiterated <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> <b>to</b> resign his position, despite insistence from Mayor Gavin Newsom. On November 7, 2007, {{a federal grand jury}} added five felony charges, including two counts each of bribery and mail fraud and one count of extortion. He was also accused of accepting $4,000 in cash from the owner of another local business, Wonderful Desserts and Cafe. Jew pleaded not guilty to all charges.|$|E
