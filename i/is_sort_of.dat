5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' which <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E

So let the people in Chicago enjoy Ferris Bueller." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The song <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> about transformation, so I {{took that}} in a nature kind of way, the way nature deals with transformation. It's {{basically}} about coming from a very poisoned place to an empowerment, a place of strength. I've always had this fear of moths, and I subconsciously wrote this thing with these moths in it, so I guess I {{have to deal with}} it. They're furry and they carry dust. I found out in old mythology they are supposed to represent the soul. I think that's very appropriate".|$|E

5000|$|P.S. Eliot was an {{explicitly}} feminist band, {{a spirit}} {{that grew out}} of their experiences operating within a male-dominated punk scene.

Furthermore, the episode was the first to test Doggett's skepticism of paranormal activity.

500|$|The term brostep {{has been}} used by some as a slight pejorative {{descriptor}} for a style of popular Americanised dubstep. US and Canadian artists often drew inspiration from British brostep producers who tended to work less with sub-bass and more with mid-range sounds such as Caspa, Rusko, and Vex'd. Rusko himself claimed in an interview on BBC Radio 1Xtra that [...] "brostep <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> my fault, but now I've started to hate it in a way...
