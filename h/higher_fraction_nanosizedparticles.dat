40|$|This paper investigates how the {{benefits}} of hedging currency risk and the incentives of a firm to hedge {{are affected by the}} hedging strategies of competing firms. In competitive industries, if currency hedging is uncommon, prices are expected to positively co-vary with exchange rate related cost shocks providing firms with a ‘natural hedge’. As the extent of currency hedging in an industry rises, prices become less sensitive to exchange rates, making profits more random. This suggests that, insofar as randomness in profits is undesirable, the decision to remain unhedged hurts expected profits more if a <b>higher</b> <b>fraction</b> of competitors are hedged. Consistent with this, I find that a firm’s decision to remain unhedged hurts its value more if a <b>higher</b> <b>fraction</b> of competitors hedge exchange rate risk. Consequently, firms are more likely to hedge currency risk if a <b>higher</b> <b>fraction</b> of their competitors do so, even after controlling for industry level exposures to currency risk. These strategic incentives are robust and appear to be more important for currency hedging decisions than some of the firm-specific factors highlighted by existing theory...|$|R

The results are compared with those for samples processed separately by HE or by HPT. Microhardness measurements were taken on cross-sectional planes of the HE billets and on the HPT disks and in addition the microstructures were examined using transmission electron microscopy. The results demonstrate that the hybrid process of HE+HPT induces additional grain refinement when compared with HPT with average grain sizes of ~ 60 and 90 nm, respectively. Also, a significantly <b>higher</b> <b>fraction</b> of high-angle grain boundaries (HAGBs) was present after HE+HPT and the beneficial role of HE pre-processing was also apparent in the microhardness measurements.

Our objectives were to determine if, as hypothesized, non-leguminous species have lower leaf N content, allocate a lower fraction of leaf N to photosynthesis and have higher maximum net photosynthetic rate (Pmax) and photosynthetic N-use efficiency (PNUE). Methods We compared the leguminous species Alhagi sparsifolia and non-leguminous species Karelinia caspica and Tamarix ramosissima in their typical habitat at the southern fringe of China’s Taklamakan Desert. Important findings As hypothesized, the non-leguminous species had significantly lower leaf N content and allocated a lower fraction of leaf N to photosynthesis. They also were more efficient in photosynthetic N partitioning. The non-leguminous species partitioned a <b>higher</b> <b>fraction</b> of the photosynthetic N to carboxylation and showed higher use efficiency of the photosynthetic N, while the leguminous species partitioned a <b>higher</b> <b>fraction</b> of the photosynthetic N to light-harvesting components. For the non-leguminous species, the <b>higher</b> <b>fraction</b> of leaf N allocated to carboxylation and bioenergetics led to higher Pmax and therefore to higher PNUE, water-use efficiency and apparent quantum yield.

40|$|Groundwater-dependent {{vegetation}} (GDV) {{is useful}} {{as an indicator}} of watertable depth and water availability in north-western China. Nitrogen (N) is an essential limiting resource for growth of GDV. To elucidate how leaf N allocation and partitioning influence photosynthesis and photosynthetic N-use efficiency (PNUE), three typical GDV species were selected, and their photosynthesis, leaf N allocation and partitioning were investigated in the Taklamakan Desert. The results showed that Karelinia caspica (Pall.) Less. and Peganum harmala L. had lower leaf N content, and allocated a lower fraction of leaf N to photosynthesis. However, they were more efficient in photosynthetic N partitioning among photosynthetic components. They partitioned a <b>higher</b> <b>fraction</b> of the photosynthetic N to carboxylation and showed higher PNUE, whereas Alhagi sparsifolia Shap. partitioned a <b>higher</b> <b>fraction</b> of the photosynthetic N to light-harvesting components. For K. caspica and P. harmala, the <b>higher</b> <b>fraction</b> of leaf N was allocated to carboxylation and bioenergetics, which led to a higher maximum net photosynthetic rate, and therefore to a higher PNUE, water-use efficiency (WUE), respiration efficiency (RE) and so on. In the desert, Nand water are limiting resources; K. caspica and P. harmala can benefit from the increased PNUE and WUE. These physiological advantages and their higher leaf-area ratio (LAR) may contribute to their higher resource-capture ability...|$|R

However, in PVDF fibers fabricated by the electrospinning process, the roles of mechanical stretching and electric poling have not been well explored.
