5|$|Poliovirus {{is usually}} spread {{from person to}} person through {{infected}} fecal matter entering the mouth. It may also be spread by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva. Those who are infected may spread the disease for up to six weeks <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>no</b> symptoms are present. The disease may be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood. The disease only occurs naturally in humans.|$|E
5|$|The President of Croatia is the {{commander-in-chief}} {{of the armed}} forces of the Republic of Croatia and appoints and relieves military commanders of duty, conforming to applicable legislation. Pursuant to decisions of the parliament, the president declares war and concludes peace. In cases of immediate threats to the independence, unity and existence of the state, the president may order the use of armed forces, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>no</b> state of war is declared, provided that such an order is countersigned by the prime minister. During a state of war, the president may promulgate regulations with the force of law on the basis of, and within the scope of, authority obtained from the parliament. In such circumstances, the president may convene government cabinet meetings and preside over them. If the parliament is not in session, the president is authorized to regulate all matters required by the state of war through regulations carrying the force of law. In case of an immediate threat to the independence, unity and existence of the state, or if the governmental bodies are prevented from performing their constitutional duties regularly, the president may, at the proposal of the prime minister, issue regulations carrying the force of law. Such regulations must also be countersigned by the prime minister to become valid. The president is required to submit regulations that are promulgated thus to the parliament for approval as soon as the parliament may convene, otherwise the regulations become void. The president cooperates with the government directing operation of the Croatian security and intelligence system. The president and the prime minister jointly appoint heads of the security agencies, and the president may attend cabinet meetings, taking part in discussions held at such meetings.|$|E

Colonoscopies are often used to diagnose colon cancer, but are also frequently used to diagnose inflammatory bowel disease.

25|$|A protein {{superfamily}} is {{the largest}} grouping (clade) of proteins for which common ancestry can be inferred (see homology). Usually this common ancestry is inferred from structural alignment and mechanistic similarity, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>no</b> sequence similarity is evident. Sequence homology can then be deduced even if not apparent (due to low sequence similarity). Superfamilies typically contain several protein families which show sequence similarity within each family. The term protein clan is commonly used for protease superfamilies based on the MEROPS protease classification system.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps the Fermi paradox itself—or {{the alien}} {{equivalent}} of it—is {{the reason for}} any civilization to avoid contact with other civilizations, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>no</b> other obstacles existed. From any one civilization's point of view, it would be unlikely {{for them to be}} the first ones to make first contact. Therefore, according to this reasoning, it is likely that previous civilizations faced fatal problems with first contact and doing so should be avoided. So perhaps every civilization keeps quiet because of the possibility that there is a real reason for others to do so.|$|E

25|$|Loosening load-in rules: The load-in period {{may last}} several weeks and cost $1 million or more. Current work rules require {{producers}} to determine ahead of time how many stagehands are needed on each given day. These numbers cannot change once load-in begins, requiring producers to pay salaries <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>no</b> work occurs. The rule ensures that workers will not be on call (and unpaid for it) during the load-in period. The producers proposed essentially eliminating the rule. The union agreed to loosen the rule, but sought to keep a minimum number of stagehands at work each day.|$|E

Although such incidents are rare among its members, the American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR) has an attorney on hand to assist.

This may also include situations with partial custody, stepchildren, etc.|$|E
25|$|The primary aim {{of modern}} warfare (in {{accordance}} {{with the principles of}} doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living.
