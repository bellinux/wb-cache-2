25|$|Class II {{cabinets}} {{provide both}} kinds of protection (of the samples and of the environment) since makeup air is also HEPA-filtered. There are five types: Type A1 (formerly A), Type A2 (formerly A/B3), Type B1, Type B2 and Type C1. Each type's requirements are defined by NSF International Standard 49, which in 2002 reclassified A/B3 cabinets (classified under the latter type if connected to an <b>exhaust</b> <b>duct)</b> as Type A2, and added the Type C1 in the 2016 standard. About 90% of all biosafety cabinets installed are Type A2 cabinets.|$|E
2500|$|The 787 {{is powered}} by two engines; these engines use all-electrical bleedless systems, {{eliminating}} the superheated air conduits normally used for aircraft power, de-icing, and other functions. As part of its [...] "Quiet Technology Demonstrator 2" [...] project, Boeing adopted several engine noise-reducing technologies for the 787. These include an air inlet containing sound-absorbing materials and <b>exhaust</b> <b>duct</b> cover with a chevron-toothed pattern on the rim for a quieter mixing of exhaust and outside air. Boeing expects these developments to make the 787 significantly quieter both inside and out. [...] The noise-reducing measures prevent sounds above 85 decibels from leaving airport boundaries.|$|E
2500|$|This {{class of}} warship is {{conspicuous}} {{for a lack}} of any funnels. To add to their stealth characteristics, the exhaust fumes from the Meko A200's gas turbines and diesel engines are cooled by spraying water into the <b>exhaust</b> <b>duct</b> and then expelled just above the ship's waterline, making the frigate almost invisible to most infrared detectors. In 2004, the project officer Rear Admiral (J.G.) Johnny Kamerman explained that the ships’ design features incorporated stealth characteristics that gave the Valour-class very low radar, acoustic, and magnetic signatures. [...] "It is the first major warship in the world with a horizontal exhaust and water jet propulsion, and has an X-form outer hull," [...] he said. Its manufacturers added that the design has the radar cross-section of a missile patrol boat, a 75% lower infrared signature than previous designs, as well as a 20% lower life-cycle cost, 25% less displacement and 30% fewer crewmen. The lack of funnels also frees up desirable room amidships for armaments, crew quarters, and store rooms.|$|E

A few weeks later, another Atlas exploded on LC-11 and it was then decided to reinstall the <b>exhaust</b> <b>ducts,</b> although it was considered unlikely that they {{had anything to do with}} the failures.|$|R
50|$|The turbine <b>exhaust</b> <b>ducting</b> and turbine <b>exhaust</b> hoods were of welded {{sheet metal}} construction. Flanges {{utilizing}} dual seals were used at component connections. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>ducting</b> conducted turbine <b>exhaust</b> gases to the thrust chamber exhaust manifold which encircled the combustion chamber approximately {{halfway between the}} throat and the nozzle exit. Exhaust gases passed through the heat exchanger and exhaust into the main combustion chamber through 180 triangular openings between the tubes of the combustion chamber.|$|R
2500|$|The engines were {{developments}} of the Rolls-Royce Kestrel K.26, later renamed Peregrine. The first prototype, L6844, used long exhaust ducts that were channelled through the wings and fuel tanks, exiting at the wing's trailing edge. This configuration was quickly changed to more conventional, external exhausts after Westland's Chief test pilot Harald Penrose nearly lost control when an <b>exhaust</b> <b>duct</b> broke and heat-fractured an aileron control rod. The engines were cooled by ducted radiators, which were set into the leading edges of the wing centre-sections to reduce drag. The airframe was built mainly of stressed-skin duraluminium, {{with the exception of}} the rear-fuselage, which used a magnesium alloy stressed skin. With the pilot sitting high under one of the world's first full bubble canopies and the low and forward location of the wing, all round visibility was good (except for directly over the nose). Four 20mm cannon were mounted in the nose; the 600lb/minute fire rate made it the most heavily armed fighter aircraft of its era. The clustering of the weapons also meant that there were no convergence problems as with wing-mounted guns. Hopes were so high for the design that it remained [...] "top secret" [...] for much of its development, although it had already been mentioned in the French press.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shape of}} the Wankel {{combustion}} chamber is more resistant to preignition operating on lower-octane rating gasoline than a comparable piston engine. The combustion chamber shape may also lead to relatively incomplete combustion of the air-fuel charge. This {{would result in a}} larger amount of unburned hydrocarbons released into the exhaust. The exhaust is, however, relatively low in NOx emissions, because combustion temperatures are lower than in other engines, and also because of some inherent exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) in early engines. Sir Harry Ricardo showed in the 1920s that for every 1% increase in the proportion of exhaust gas in the admission mix, there is a 7°C reduction in flame temperature. This allowed Mazda to meet the United States Clean Air Act of 1970 in 1973, with a simple and inexpensive [...] "thermal reactor", which was an enlarged chamber in the exhaust manifold. By decreasing the air-fuel ratio, unburned hydrocarbons (HC) in the exhaust would support combustion in the thermal reactor. Piston-engine cars required expensive catalytic converters to deal with both unburned hydrocarbons and NOx emissions. This inexpensive solution increased fuel consumption, which was already a weak point for the Wankel engine, and the oil crisis of 1973 raised the price of gasoline. Toyota discovered that injection of air into the exhaust port zone improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. The best results were obtained with holes in the side plates; doing it in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>duct</b> had no noticeable influence. The use of a three-stage catalysts, with air supplied in the middle, as for two-stroke piston engines, also proved beneficial.|$|E
