40|$|AbstractBackground“Calling for help, {{performing}} {{first aid}} and providing Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) ” {{is part of}} the educational goals in secondary schools in Belgium (Flanders). However, for teachers it is not always clear at what age children can be taught which aspects of first aid. In addition, {{it is not clear what}} constitutes “performing first aid” and we strongly advocate that the first aid curriculum is broader than CPR training alone. ObjectivesTo develop an evidence-based <b>educational</b> <b>pathway</b> to enable the integration of first aid into the school curriculum by defining the goals to be achieved for knowledge, skills and attitudes, for different age groups. MethodsStudies were identified through electronic databases research (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase). We included studies on first aid education for children and adolescents up to 18 years old. A multidisciplinary expert panel formulated their practice experience and expert opinion and discussed the available evidence. ResultsWe identified 5822 references and finally retained 30 studies (13 experimental and 17 observational studies), including studies concerning emergency call (7 studies), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (18 studies), AED (Automated External Defibrillator) use (6 studies), recovery position (5 studies), choking (2 studies), injuries (5 studies), and poisoning (2 studies). Recommendations (educational goals) were derived after carefully discussing the currently available evidence in the literature and balancing the skills and attitudes of children of different ages. ConclusionsAn evidence-based <b>educational</b> <b>pathway</b> with educational goals concerning learning first aid for each age group was developed. This <b>educational</b> <b>pathway</b> can be used for the integration of first aid training in school curricula...|$|E

40|$|The nursing {{profession}} has sustained {{a state of}} disorder. The debate within the disorder historically exists in relationship to multiple educational pathways for entry into RN practice. Diploma, BSN, and ADN pathways still exist today {{as a means to}} enter into nursing practice through RN licensure. Historical research of the three pathway developments is significant and timely in that the evidence from the study helps to shed light on professional issues resurfacing in the "BSN in 10 " proposals.   The purpose of this research is to understand the socio-cultural-political context surrounding the decisions to develop the diploma, BSN, and ADN educational pathways; the historical debate concerning the role and functions, <b>educational</b> <b>pathway,</b> and professional identity of the entry-level RN; and the relationship between the <b>educational</b> <b>pathway</b> developments and the resurfacing historical debate.   Historical case study research focused on three historical decision points for the <b>educational</b> <b>pathway</b> developments: Diploma-Bellevue Training School for Nurses in New York, 1873; BSN-University of Cincinnati School for Nursing and Health in Ohio, 1916; and ADN-Orange County Community College nursing program in Middletown, New York, 1952. Archival retrieval of primary documents for each case study was completed.   Each <b>educational</b> <b>pathway</b> development revealed divisions of gender and paternalistic control over nursing, divisions of class within nursing, and an undefined division of nursing labor. Prolonged paternalistic control rooted in divisions of gender, coupled with the divisions of class and unstructured divisions of labor within nursing, prevented full realization of a professional, collegiate education for entry into RN practice.   The historical debate continues as a distinct professional identity and role does not exist for the entry-level RN. Lack of clear differentiation of role and functions within nursing practice for each pathway nurse creates an education-practice disorder, sustains division within the profession of nursing, and permits continued paternalistic control over nursing. Facing the "BSN in 10 " proposals, nursing must reach a decision regarding the needed division of labor within nursing for today's health care system. Nursing can resolve the historical debate by reframing Montag's practice model and delineating an educational preparation for each practice role.   Ph. D...|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} the geological history (Late Proterozoic to Quaternary) of the Manětín Permian-Carboniferous basin. It also studies the historical and present use of raw materials (ores, non-metallics, caustobiolites) in the Manětín area, {{the northern part of}} the Plzeň-sever district. In appendix, information panels of the <b>educational</b> <b>pathway</b> are proposed. The Manětín basin consists of two structural levels. The lower one (Proterozoic metapelites) forms the base of the basin. The upper one (Permian-Carboniferous clastic sedimentary rocks) is the filling of the basin. There are also a few Proterozoic and Tertiary volcanic bodies. In the past, ore deposits (gold, silver, iron) had been exploited in the Manětín area. Non-metallics (glass sand, ocher, pyrite-slate, roof-slate, structural clay products, arkose) had been largely used, too. There was only a small scale extraction of caustobiolites (humites). Today's extraction is focused on natural stone (crushed stone) only (Zahrádka and Březín deposits). The proposal of the <b>educational</b> <b>pathway</b> contains seven information boards, that show the geological history of the Manětín basin and the use of local mineral raw materials (gold, slate, natural stone) with it's influence on the landscape, society and industry, particularly glass production.
