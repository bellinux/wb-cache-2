He helped recruit a regiment from among the coastal African tribes, although he wrote of the Fantis that “it {{would be difficult to}} <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> cowardly, useless lot of men”.

500|$|According to Olivia Banner of Signs, medical {{journals}} generally had positive {{reviews of the}} novel for its depiction of the inner lives of intersex people. Writing in Archives of Disease in Childhood, Simon Fountain-Polley praised the novel, writing: [...] "All clinicians, and families who have faced gender crises or difficult life-changing decision on identity should read this book; delve into an emotional trip of discovery—where the slightest direction change could lead to myriad different lives." [...] Abraham Bergman wrote in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine: [...] "Yes, it is fiction, but I cannot <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> authentic and sensitive voice. Because our interactions usually take place in limited and structured setting such as offices and hospitals, pediatricians have scant opportunity to learn how our young patients think. One way to sharpen our awareness is to listen to children's voices as they are expressed in books. In Middlesex, the voice is loud and clear." [...] Banner noted {{that most of the}} reviews in intersex and queer publications praised Middlesex. She posited that the problematic issues of a [...] "heteromasculine-identified narrator" [...] and the [...] "fact that it was authored by a heterosexual man" [...] may have been outweighed by the necessity for an appropriate reading that [...] "destigmatizes ambiguous sex".|$|E
500|$|Bryan Byun, of DVD Verdict, {{believes}} that Welling {{was the perfect}} choice for Clark Kent: [...] "I can't <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> ideal actor to play this superpowered farm boy than Tom Welling, with his wholesome, honest face and heroic good looks—Welling not only resembles Christopher Reeve physically, but has all of the earnest charm that made Reeve the quintessential Superman." [...] The Free Lance–Stars Ron Hedelt likened Welling's performances as Clark Kent to that of Christopher Reeve's performances in the Superman films, stating that Welling manages to portray a [...] "... sweet, unassuming teenager ..." [...] while showing Clark struggle with the truth about himself. Comics2Film's Rob Worley also wrote of the physical resemblance Welling has to Christopher Reeve, noting that the actor gave the character depth with his convincing portrayal of Clark's longing to fit in. When comparing Smallville's Clark Kent to Bryan Singer's Superman (Brandon Routh) in Superman Returns, Seattle Times Julia Waterhous found Smallville's Clark Kent to be the more intriguing character. Waterhous explained that {{this was due to}} the inner turmoil of Clark— not being able to tell those he loved his secret— and the fact that no matter what his faults were he continued to put others before himself, remaining [...] "... pure and good ...". She explained that this allowed the audience to become intimate with the character, something lacking in the film version. According to the Associated Press, Welling's popularity as Clark Kent on Smallville had fans of the show wishing he would take the role Routh received in Superman Returns.|$|E

500|$|In October 1999, in {{the year}} {{following}} Tippett's death, A Child of Our Time received a belated New York Philharmonic premiere, at the Avery Fisher Hall. The New York Times reviewer, Paul Griffiths, expressed some astonishment {{that this was the}} orchestra's first attempt at the work. As part of the celebrations for the centenary of the composer's birth in January 2005, English National Opera staged a dramatised performance of the work, directed by Jonathan Kent—coincidentally, the first performance fell in the week of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the death camps at Auschwitz. Anna Picard, writing in The Independent, recognised the work's sincerity but found the dramatisation of its pacifist message wholly inappropriate: [...] "Do we really need to see a dozen well-fed actors and singers stripped and led into a smoking pit {{in order to understand the}} Holocaust?" [...] Anthony Holden in The Observer was more positive, commenting that [...] "If you must stage a work intended for concert performance ... it is hard to <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> effective version than Kent's, shot through with heavy symbolism of which Tippett would surely have approved." [...] Nevertheless, Holden found the overall result [...] "super-solemn, lurching between the over-literalistic and the portentous". The 2005 Holocaust Days of Remembrance (1–8 May) were marked at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC by a special performance of A Child of Our time, in which the Washington Chorus was directed by Robert Shafer. The piece was performed at the BBC Proms 2016 on 23 July by the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales.|$|E

[...] Richard Corliss of Time stated that: [...] "It's great to see Disney returning to its roots and blooming anew: creating superior musical entertainment that draws on the Walt [...] tradition of animation splendor and the verve of Broadway present." [...] Richard Roeper wrote that the film was an [...] "absolute delight from start to finish." [...] Both Michael Phillips of Chicago Tribune and Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the film's characters and musical sequences, which also drew comparisons to the theatrics found in Wicked. Emma Dibdin of Digital Spy awarded the film five out of five stars and called the film [...] "a new Disney classic" [...] and [...] "an exhilarating, joyous, human story that's as frequently laugh-out-loud funny as it is startling and daring and poignant. Hot {{on the heels of}} the 90th anniversary, it's impossible to <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> perfect celebration of everything Disney is at its best." [...] Frozen was also praised in Norwegian Sámi media as showcasing Sámi culture to a broad audience in a good way. Composer Frode Fjellheim was lauded by Norwegian Sámi President Aili Keskitalo for his contributions to the film, during the President's 2014 New Year's speech.|$|E

[...] Marcotte noted that the [...] "Resistance" [...] is lead, for the audience, by two women in Johnson and Simmons, reflecting the 2017 Women's March, and also that Hydra gained power using fear of Inhumans just as [...] "Trump was able to ride a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment into power". She also highlighted Simmons' warning to a young boy that all Hydra agent are Nazis, calling this a warning [...] "to the audience, reminding them not to forget exactly what kind of authoritarian monster has been put in the White House." [...] Michal Schick of Hypable noted that the political commentary had been running throughout the season, with Nadeer and the Humans First movement, but that [...] "in the face of murderous demons with combustable craniums and body-swapping LMD’s, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. largely kept the commentary in the background. That changed—drastically—as the show entered" [...] the final pod. Schick highlighted the fact that [...] "for all of the clear allusions to Trump’s America, the president himself remains unparodied. The mistress of the Framework’s perversities is Aida, as Madame Hydra, and it’s hard to <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> different figure from Trump ... By omitting this easiest and most obvious point of satire, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. broadens its message beyond straight contemporary commentary. It is easy (and desperately tempting) to place blame all of our ills and evils on a current administration, and easy to pin all the ills of the Framework on Aida. But an element of individual responsibility burns through, both in our own lives and in this fiction." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{is evident}} that by and large Creelman stands strong in his {{justification}} for the Porfiriato and cannot <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> appropriate character than Díaz to have ruled Mexico. Creelman sees Díaz as the epitome of a Mexican: “There is no more heroic, no more picturesque, no more commanding and appealing figure {{in the world than}} Porfirio Díaz, in whose veins leaps the tide-rip of two races and two civilizations.” Even as Díaz had revealed his plans to retire from office three years earlier and then decided to go against his own word, Díaz, according to Creelman’s interpretation, saw himself as a self-sacrificing patriot who thought no one else could rule Mexico better than himself. Díaz believed that the Mexican people demanded he remain in office because they knew no other president would keep the status quo. This begs the question: who were the Mexican people? Did these include Indians? And if most Indians did not participate in politics, how did Díaz conclude that he was loved by them? His logic ran thusly: Indians are naturally lazy and have an indifference for politics, which causes them to either believe that “things are bound to go on well under [...] direction...or that it would be worse than useless to attempt to oppose anything he favored.” Likely, this was part of Creelman’s embellishments to Díaz’s story.|$|E
