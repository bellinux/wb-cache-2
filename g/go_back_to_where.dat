500|$|In a 2002 interview, Ridley Scott {{stated that}} a new Alien project [...] "would {{be a lot of}} fun", but that [...] "the most {{important}} thing was to get the story right". Scott's concept for the plot was [...] "to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> the alien creatures were first found and explain how they were created", which became the basis of his prequel series. In late 2008, Weaver hinted in an interview with MTV that she and Scott were working on an Alien spinoff film, which would focus on the chronicles of Ellen Ripley rather than on the Aliens, but the continuation of Ripley's story has not materialized. Instead, Scott worked on a prequel that explained the [...] "Space Jockey" [...] found on the derelict spacecraft from Alien, titled Prometheus, which was released in June 8, 2012.

On learning that Fox intended to pursue Alien vs. Predator, Cameron believed the film would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise" [...] and ceased work on his story, [...] "To me, that was Frankenstein Meets Werewolf. It was Universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other...Milking it." [...] After viewing Alien vs. Predator, however, Cameron remarked that [...] "it was actually pretty good. I think of the five Alien films, I'd rate it third. I actually liked it. I actually liked it a lot." [...] Conversely, Ridley Scott had no interest in the Alien vs. Predator films.

The jackal circled {{the world in a}} day and two of its hands were {{transformed}} into paws. [...] The supreme being gave it the ngud tree (guiera senegalensis) and thus ngud became the first tree and the second thing created by Roog. After the creation of ngud, the nalafun tree (combretum paniculatum) was created to whom the deity told: [...] "Go and keep the ngud tree company, it is lonely". During the life cycle of the nalafun, the tree grow so tall that it headed towards the sky.

[...] Later in the series, after having met with refugees from Afghanistan who settled in Melbourne as well as visiting war-torn Kabul, Anderson softened his stand on the subject: [...] "Now I've been here and spoken to people, I don't want to turn away refugees, I don't want to turn away people who need to be reunited with their families. I don't want that. Who would want that? [...] I don't want people to go on suffering needlessly, when we can give them somewhere safe to be.
