50|$|The RF&P Sub {{is part of}} CSX's {{eastern seaboard}} line, and carries freight trains, as well as {{passenger}} trains for Amtrak and Virginia Railway <b>Express</b> (VRE). <b>Freight</b> <b>traffic</b> capacity on the subdivision has been limited by the dated design of the Virginia Avenue Tunnel. The tunnel is single-tracked and has restricted vertical clearance, which precludes the use of double-stack freight cars.

50|$|Traffic to Dietzenbach {{flourished in}} the period after the Second World War. In 1959 there were still 25 daily trains to Offenbach, but in 1978 there were only five. On 18 June 1982, {{passenger}} services were closed to Dietzenbach; this was followed {{a few years later}} by the abandonment of <b>express</b> <b>freight</b> and baggage <b>traffic.</b> The tracks were retained and preserved.|$|R
50|$|From 1908 to 1914 {{the branch}} {{was used for}} summer {{passenger}} traffic from Whitby, after which the line only carried <b>freight</b> <b>traffic.</b> <b>Freight</b> <b>traffic</b> ended in 1951.|$|R

50|$|Freight {{forwarded}} on {{the line}} is greatly dependent on the direction of movement. Between Taedonggang and Hwangju, southbound <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> is 1.8 to 2 times greater than northbound, between Sariwŏn and P'yŏngsan, 56% of <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> is northbound, slightly higher than southbound.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{increase}} in passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> {{in a region}} reflects the development of railways, highways, waterways, aviation, and pipeline. With the growth of economy, China's transportation develops rapidly. However, the passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> present different growth features in different regions. Therefore, a reasonable forecast model for passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> and the analysis of relationship between regional transportation and economy are important for transportation planning. The elasticity coefficient between the passenger <b>traffic</b> volume, <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> volume and gross domestic product (GDP) {{is calculated based on}} the data from 2001 to 2010 in different regions in China. Then, the relationship between the change of regional traffic volume and regional economic development is obtained. With the analysis of the pros and cons for different forecast models, Elasticity Coefficient Method, GM (1, 1) model, and DGM model have been used to forecast passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> volumes from 2011 to 2015. In order to improve the accuracy of the forecast results, the combined models based on the variance reciprocal and the optimal weighting are applied to optimize the forecasting model. Among all the forecast models, the combined model with optimal weights outperforms other models with a relative error less than 0. 006 % for the <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> volume. The accuracy of forecast models on passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> volume has been improved, which provides a reasonable basis for the planning and development of the transportation system...|$|R

50|$|The {{handling}} of freight {{at the station}} {{is not subject to}} restrictions. A crane, a terminal ramp and side ramps and a 40 tonne weighbridge were formerly available for <b>freight</b> <b>traffic.</b> <b>Freight</b> <b>traffic</b> was discontinued in 1976.

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{characteristics}} of the <b>express</b> <b>freight</b> transportation network such as multi-mode operations and high requirements for delivery service, the method for determining the capacity of the <b>express</b> <b>freight</b> transportation service network was put forward under constraint of reliability of the delivery time. The hybrid intelligent algorithm was designed, which integrated the genetic operation and Monte Carlo simulation. Referring to the existing relevant literature, results of a numerical case show as follows: When the demand level of <b>express</b> <b>freight</b> transportation is low, the <b>express</b> <b>freight</b> transportation service network is able to finish all freight assignments at the required delivery time; when the <b>express</b> <b>freight</b> transportation demand reaches a very high level, the reliability of the <b>express</b> <b>freight</b> transportation service network decreases dramatically, i. e., in the case of congestion, the reliability of on-time delivery is hard to be guaranteed...|$|R

40|$|Corporate {{strategies}} and decisions concerning location, such as outsourcing of individual production processes, {{have an impact}} on the volume of <b>freight</b> <b>traffic.</b> Due to concentration of core competences, new logistics trends, growing importance of services and liberalization of markets, corporate strategies undergo rapid changes. Their spatial impact is of interest, especially when taking into account that new corporate behaviour can increase as well as reduce <b>freight</b> <b>traffic.</b> The overall impact of these changes are very unclear and little empirical evidence is available besides various insights from networks in the automotive sector. For example reducing the level of in-house production may multiply the number of suppliers. They in turn deliver the required parts more frequently but in smaller batches thus increasing the volume of freight transportation. On the other hand the manifest trend towards the concentration and bundling of single suppliers in the form of component or systems suppliers tends to reduce <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> for production inputs. The paper examines two key aspects. First it sheds light on the interrelationships of structural changes of the economy, in particular of corporate behaviour (e. g. outsourcing, just-in-time production, telecommunications) and the volume of <b>freight</b> <b>traffic.</b> Second we will try to answer the following question: in what types of companies does the division of labour along the chain of value added lead to increased <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> and where can <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> be reduced by means of telematics. The paper draws from an empirical study of a region in Central Switzerland. Recommendations for public as well as private actors will deal with potentials to reduce <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> through cooperative efforts. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Express</b> <b>freight</b> {{transportation}} {{is a rich}} seam of profit for China railway, and railway <b>express</b> <b>freight</b> system is a complex system with multiple variables and nonlinear feedback loops. This paper presents a System Dynamic Model for simulating the interaction between demand and supply of railway <b>express</b> <b>freight</b> system in China. The model consists of three submodels including economic environment, demand, supply, and investment, and its validity is verified by running in Vensim DDS software using historical data. In the simulation of period 2000 – 2025, the three variables are taken as control variables including growth rate of the national economy, railway <b>express</b> <b>freight</b> rate, and investment in fixed railway assets. Three scenarios for each control variable are simulated, and their effects are analyzed to provide beneficial reference for regulating the demand-supply gap of railway <b>express</b> <b>freight.</b> The simulation demonstrated that raising freight rate, adding investment in fixed railway assets, and decelerating economic growth rate are all effective ways to shrink the demand-supply gap of railway <b>express</b> <b>freight.</b> The model {{can be used to}} forecast the transport demand of railway <b>express</b> <b>freight</b> and test the outcomes of demand-supply regulating measures...|$|R
