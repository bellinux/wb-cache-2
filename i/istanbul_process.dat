40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to share a new method in {{architectural}} design studio teaching. In order to overcome the problems related to the pedagogy of the architectural design studio, an experiment was conducted in both fall and spring semesters of the 2010 - 2011 academic year and fall semester of the 2011 - 2012 academic year in Architectural Design Studio 4 in Yıldız Technical University Faculty of Architecture, <b>Istanbul.</b> The <b>process</b> was designed to eliminate the pairing up of a single tutor and a student. Every week one single consultation and one group review where all of the studio teachers overviewed the projects together was constituted. After completion of the experiment, a questionnaire for both students and tutors was conducted.

50|$|The Anglophone branch {{started in}} October 2005, {{at the very}} moment the {{negotiations}} for the Accession of Turkey to the European Union began. To help the students analysing this process, the programme includes terms in Istanbul, Nice and Berlin, and it is complemented by a study trip to European and international organisations in Europe. In <b>Istanbul,</b> the <b>process</b> of the Europeanization of Turkey is a central topic, together with the neighbourhood policies and external relations of the European Union with the Caucasus countries and Central Asia. In Nice, the students continue to be cultivated with topics of both historical and contemporary significance with the help of distinguished professors, experts and current and former employees of EU bodies, governments and international organisations EU-wide; they undergo mid-term examinations and are taken to selected EU institutions international organisations and governments for formal visits. And in Berlin, the students prepare themselves for final examinations and thesis drafting. Meanwhile, they are encouraged to participate in academic activities held across Berlin by various universities and organisations. Successful candidates graduate with Master in Advanced European and International Studies, 60 ECTS credits.|$|R

50|$|On April 26, 2013, Almaty, Kazakhstan, {{hosted the}} third Ministerial Conference of the <b>Istanbul</b> <b>Process</b> which {{gathered}} leaders from Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan,and the United Arab Emirates along with Western countries and international organizations, to discuss mechanisms to support regional cooperation.

The meeting also produced a declaration in support of Afghanistan’s development and the withdrawal of international forces. Kazakhstan’s diplomats supported regional efforts in the areas of counter-terrorism and counter-narcotics trafficking, trade promotion, the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline, the CASA-1000 electricity project, and the expansion of the transit corridors under the Asian Development Bank’s Central Asia Regional Economic Corridor (CAREC) Program.

5000|$|Turkey {{recognised}} India {{right after}} its {{declaration of independence}} on 15 August 1947 and diplomatic relations were established between the two countries. As Turkey {{was part of the}} Western Alliance and India of the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War era, the bilateral relations did not develop at a desired pace. However, {{since the end of the}} Cold War era, both sides put in effort in developing their bilateral relations in every field. In contemporary times, relations between India and Turkey have been strained due to Turkey's religious mutuality with Pakistan. Until recently, Turkey was a vocal advocate of Pakistan's position on the Kashmir dispute. Turkey was also one of the few opponents to India's inclusion into the Nuclear Suppliers Group. However, in recent years, the relations between the two countries have warmed due to common strategic goals, and there is a growing bilateral cooperation in the fields of education, technology and commerce. Turkey has softened its pro-Pakistani approach on the Kashmir issue thinking that it is important to build up a coherent and comprehensive relationship with India and develop a holistic Asian policy. Turkey has since reversedits support to Pakistan’s position on Kashmir, moving from a call for a plebiscite under UN supervision to stressing the importance of India-Pakistan bilateral talks to resolve the issue, which is by and large closer to India’s position, which still doesn't improve much since India vehemently opposes a UN referendum (as it always has). India's GMR Group is one of the main stakeholders in the new Sabiha Gökçen International Airport in İstanbul. [...] Both the countries are members of the G20 group of major economies, where the two countries have closely cooperated on the management of the world economy. Bilateral trade in July 2012 stood at US$ 7.5 billion, a figure that is expected to double to US$ 15 billion by 2015. Strategically too, there are growing areas of consensus. On Afghanistan, Turkey had taken the lead in 2011 to begin the <b>Istanbul</b> <b>Process</b> to find meaningful and sustainable solutions to Afghanistan’s problems. The <b>Istanbul</b> <b>Process</b> culminated in the annual “Heart of Asia” regional conference on Afghanistan held in Kazakhstan’s former capital, Almaty, with both India and Turkey playing important roles. In the context of the planned 2014 withdrawal of NATO and US troops from Afghanistan, the need for Delhi and Ankara to intensify dialogue over Afghanistan has acquired a particular importance.|$|E
40|$|In {{the market}} place, service/product {{providers}} often use some limited resources to satisfy different demands. This practice leads to {{question of how}} to manage the selling process of limited resources to maximize the total revenue. This study presents an overview on the impact of dynamic capacity management through options approach for airline industries. A Revenue Management model using options approach is also presented. Capacity is an important constraint in seat inventory control and using the capacity in a more flexible way can bring operational efficiency with higher loading factors, that is defined as the ratio of passengers over total capacity for a flight leg. Options for the right of buying and selling plane tickets would potentially lead to a new proactive market realm by taking control in allocating capacity and to increase efficiency of the booking <b>process.</b> <b>İstanbul</b> Ticaret Üniversites...|$|R

The financial indicators, which have been associated with investor numbers as using a indicator of interest of investors, are leverage ratio, market to book value ratio, net profit margin and sales size. The achieved results for the admired companies portfolio have been compared with the results of the market portfolio which has consisted of manufacturing companies that have been continuously processed in ISE. A significantly negative relation between market to book value ratio for t period and interest of investors for t+ 1 period has been found for both portfolios in this study by using panel data analysis. The relation between net profit margin and interest of investors is significantly positive for the market portfolio but there is not any significant relation for the admired companies portfolio...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, City and Regional Planning, İzmir, 2002 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 298 - 302) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxx, 308 leavesThis {{thesis is}} mainly about the debates, issues, and agendas {{stemming from the}} social, economic, political, and cultural. restructuring processes., which have been experienced {{since the end of}} the 1970 s and are yet ongoing at the outset of the 21 st century. The conceptualizations, analyses, and explanations made on these profound processes, and on the city and the region are the crucial foci within the thesis. The major findings derived from the evaluations, discussions, and propositions are explored in a case study on one of the major cities of Turkey, İzmir and its region. Among many, especially the. regionalism.,. governance.,. growth management., and. strategic planning. are the highlighted subjects. The. city-region. is offered to be a proper spatial analysis and planning unit for the integrated strategic planning approaches; the. producer services. is pointed out as a rising service sub-sector representing the economic restructuring processes with the important spatial concerns; and furthermore, the role of the spatial planning, policy, and the planner within the restructuring division of labor, the rise of strategic planning and of large scale projects on the redefined cities, city-regions, and the wider regions throughout the restructuring processes are the emphasized planning concerns within the thesis. Though not so dense and intensified compared with that of İstanbul region, İzmir region and the wider economic-geographic region are identified to be subject to substantial restructurings coupling with the global, nationwide, and <b>İstanbul</b> region centered <b>processes</b> since the beginning of the 1980 s. The fundamental evidences on İzmir region are cited within; the repositioning in the national economic and spatial system, the shifts in the GDP and employment structure of economic sectors, emerging major spatial projects, changes and transformations within the spatial order and land use pattern, and the recent tendencies of planning approaches. GIS has been used as a fundamental tool throughout the economic, geographic, and historical analyses. One of the major points that the thesis points out is the need for critical and empirical work on the dialectics between the restructuring processes, and the cities, city-regions and the wider regions especially in the so-called third world geographies to be of use in the developing governance, management, and strategic planning studies within the complex and hierarchical interrelations of the settlements...|$|R
