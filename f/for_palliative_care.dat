25|$|Oxycodone is {{available}} as controlled-release tablet, {{intended to be}} taken every 12 hours. A 2006 review found that controlled-release oxycodone is comparable to instant-release oxycodone, morphine, and hydromorphone in management of moderate to severe cancer pain, with fewer side effects than morphine. The author concluded that the controlled release form is a valid alternative to morphine and a first-line treatment for cancer pain. In 2014, the European Association <b>for</b> <b>Palliative</b> <b>Care</b> recommended oral oxycodone as a second-line alternative to oral morphine for cancer pain.|$|E
25|$|Hospice Africa Uganda (HAU) {{founded by}} Anne Merriman, began {{offering}} services in 1993 in a two-bedroom house loaned {{for the purpose}} by Nsambya Hospital.

That same year saw the opening of Little Hospice Hoima in June. Hospice care in Uganda is supported by community volunteers and professionals, as Makerere University offers a distance diploma in palliative care. The government of Uganda has a strategic plan <b>for</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> and permits nurses and clinical officers from HAU to prescribe morphine.|$|E

25|$|High-intensity focused {{ultrasound}} (HIFU) {{is still}} in investigatory phases in many places around the world. In China it has CFDA approval and over 180 treatment centres have been established in China, Hong Kong, and Korea. HIFU has been successfully used to treat cancer to destroy tumours of the bone, brain, breast, liver, pancreas, rectum, kidney, testes, and prostate. Several thousand patients have been treated with various types of tumours. HIFU has CE approval <b>for</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> for bone metastasis. Experimentally, palliative care has been provided for cases of advanced pancreatic cancer. High-energy therapeutic ultrasound could increase higher-density anti-cancer drug load and nanomedicines to target tumor sites by 20x fold higher than traditional target cancer therapy.|$|E
25|$|That Dragon, Cancer {{bore out}} from {{experiences}} that Ryan and Amy Green had after their third child Joel {{was diagnosed with}} an atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor at twelve months of age, around November 2010. The doctors had only given the child about four months to live, but despite developing seven additional tumors, Joel continued to live for four more years. Joel's condition left him mentally underdeveloped, being unable to speak even by age 2, and he required additional parental care and supervision, alongside numerous visits to doctors and hospitals <b>for</b> <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> and chemotherapy treatment. In early 2014, Joel's condition worsened, and the Greens temporarily moved from Colorado to San Francisco {{to take part in}} an experimental drug trial. The new drug failed to relieve any of the new symptoms. Ryan and Amy, following the advice of the hospice, decided to take him off his feeding tube, and he died on March 13, 2014 at the age of five.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} the legal {{framework}} in Ireland <b>for</b> specialist <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> is inadequate and consequently a more appropriate legal framework must be identified. This research is guided by three central research questions. The first central research question examines {{the legitimacy of the}} distinction between specialist <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> and euthanasia. The second central research question asks what legal framework currently exists in Ireland <b>for</b> specialist <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> The third central research question examines an alternative legal framework <b>for</b> specialist <b>palliative.</b> This thesis is composed of seven chapters. The first Chapter is an introduction to the thesis and defines the terminology and the central research questions. Chapter Two explores the development and practice of <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> in Ireland. Chapter Three examines the distinction in criminal law between specialist <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> practices and euthanasia. Chapter Four examines the human rights framework <b>for</b> specialist <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> Chapter Five critiques the regulatory framework in Ireland <b>for</b> specialist <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> Having gained a thorough understanding of <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> and the related legal framework, this thesis then engages in comparative analysis of the Netherlands which is used as a source of ideas for reform in Ireland. Chapter Seven is the concluding chapter and, in it, the main findings of this thesis are summarised. The main findings being that: the distinction between specialist <b>palliative</b> <b>care</b> and euthanasia is not sufficiently supported by justifications such as a double effect or the acts and omissions distinction, there is no clear decision-making framework in Ireland <b>for</b> specialist <b>palliative</b> <b>care,</b> and the current legal framework lacks clarity and does not promote consistency between providers of specialist <b>palliative</b> <b>care.</b> This Chapter also proposes that detailed professional standards and guidelines are likely to be the most appropriate way to effect individual and institutional change in the provision of specialist <b>palliative</b> <b>care...</b>|$|R
