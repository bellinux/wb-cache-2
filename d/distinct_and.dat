Wenham argued that since the impact of the food laws was a public affair, this would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a reminder of their distinct status as Jews.|$|E

5|$|Although not well-studied, {{there is}} growing {{acceptance}} of three species of Malagasy hippopotamus. It is not known when or exactly how these hippos arrived {{on the island of}} Madagascar. As hippos are semi-aquatic, it is possible that they survived the 400km (248mi) trek across the channel, although presumably when the water was shallower and there were perhaps small islands along the way. It is possible that the three species of hippopotamus represent three <b>distinct</b> <b>and</b> successful colonizations of the island. Hippos are the only endemic ungulates ever to have lived on Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|During the Middle Ages, {{the monastic}} traditions of both Western and Eastern Christianity moved beyond vocal prayer to Christian meditation.

5|$|Hellenization {{was coined}} by the German {{historian}} Johann Gustav Droysen to denote {{the spread of}} Greek language, culture, and population into the former Persian empire after Alexander's conquest. That this export took place is undoubted, and {{can be seen in}} the great Hellenistic cities of, for instance, Alexandria, Antioch and Seleucia (south of modern Baghdad). Alexander sought to insert Greek elements into Persian culture and attempted to hybridize Greek and Persian culture. This culminated in his aspiration to homogenize the populations of Asia and Europe. However, his successors explicitly rejected such policies. Nevertheless, Hellenization occurred throughout the region, accompanied by a <b>distinct</b> <b>and</b> opposite 'Orientalization' of the successor states.|$|E

40|$|We {{search for}} {{impartiality}} in {{the allocation of}} objects when monetary transfers are not possible. Our main focus is anonymity. The standard definition requires that if agents' names are permuted, their assignments should be permuted in the same way.

" We show that {{for more than two}} agents and two objects, no rule is pairwise-anonymous on <b>distinct</b> preferences <b>and</b> Pareto-efficient (Theorem 1), no rule is pairwise-anonymous on <b>distinct</b> preferences <b>and</b> independent of others' permutations (Theorem 2), and no rule is pairwise-anonymous on <b>distinct</b> profiles <b>and</b> strategy-proof (Theorem 3).

5|$|A creamy-white or {{pale yellow}} stripe, bordered above with gold and below with black, extends {{from behind the}} eye, across the {{typically}} copper-coloured tympanum to the groin. This stripe rises to form a dorsolateral fold towards the groin. Another stripe of the same colour begins below the eye and continues to the shoulder. The abdomen is cream or white, and has a coarsely granular texture. The legs are green, bronze, {{or a combination of}} both, and the inside thigh and groin are blue-green. Mature males develop a yellowish colouration to the vocal sacs on their throats. The tympanum is <b>distinct</b> <b>and</b> ovular in shape, and the species has enlarged toe discs to aid in climbing. As this species is often found in water, the fingers are free from webbing, while the toes are almost completely webbed. When in breeding condition, males develop nuptial pads on their thumbs, which are used to grip females during mating. These are coloured brown during the breeding season, but are inconspicuous and paler {{during the rest of the}} year. During the breeding season, females develop a blueish hue on their feet, while males' legs turn rusty orange.|$|E
