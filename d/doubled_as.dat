His statue was ultimately raised in Iași in 1883.|$|E

40|$|In {{what follows}} {{the idea of}} the online double is {{historically}} contextualised and analysed. Beginning with the contemporary idea of the ‘selfie’ <b>as</b> online self-induced <b>double,</b> I proceed to discuss the Doppelgänger’s (double) mythical and literary roots, in order to expand the discussion of the selfie to include the online double. Two instances of the online double are unpacked, namely the <b>double</b> <b>as</b> shadow and the <b>double</b> <b>as</b> a stand-in or alter-ego, which correspond significantly with Marshall McLuhan’s analysis of the Narcissus myth and technological use. McLuhan reveals the doubled nature of our technological engagement that leads to either self-amputation or self-amplification. In my analysis, the <b>double</b> <b>as</b> shadow is correlated with self-amputation and the <b>double</b> <b>as</b> alterego with self-amplification. It is argued that the <b>double</b> <b>as</b> shadow is evoked online through the mining of data regarding the self that is captured consciously and unconsciously to create {{what is known as the}} Data Doppelgänger. The figure of the Doppelgänger is further vividly conjured through virtual stand-ins or alter-egos that act on behalf of the self to create a tele-presence through examples such as Project Lifelike and rep. licants. org.
