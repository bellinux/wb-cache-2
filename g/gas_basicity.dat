Statistical analysis of the two channels indicates that the proton affinity of HO is 3 6 4 kJ/mol {{lower than that of}} SO 3. This can be used to derive PA(SO 3) 5 591 6 4 kJ/mol at 0 K and 596 6 4 kJ/mol at 298 K. Previously, Munson and Smith bracketed the proton affinity as PA(HBr) 5 584 kJ/mol, PA(SO 3), PA(CO) 5 594 kJ/mol. The threshold of 152 6 16 kJ/mol for formation of H 2 O 1 1 SO 3 indicates that the barrier to CID is small or nonexistent, in contrast to the substantial barriers to decomposition for H 3 SO 4 1 and H 2 SO 4.

40|$|The gas-phase complex UO 2 (TMOGA) (2) (2 +) (TMOGA = tetramethyl- 3 -oxa-glutaramide) {{prepared}} by electrospray ionization {{was characterized by}} infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy. The IRMPD spectrum from 700 - 1800 cm(- 1) was interpreted using a computational study based on density functional theory. The predicted vibrational frequencies are in good agreement with the measured values, with an average deviation of only 8 cm(- 1) (< 1 %) and a maximum deviation of 21 cm(- 1) (< 2 %). The only IR peak assigned to the linear uranyl moiety was the asymmetric v(3) mode, which appeared at 965 cm(- 1) and was predicted by DFT as 953 cm(- 1). This v(3) frequency is red-shifted relative to bare uranyl, UO 22 +, by ca. 150 cm(- 1) due to electron donation from the TMOGA ligands. Based {{on the degree of}} red-shifting, it is inferred that two TMOGA oxygen-donor ligands have a greater effective <b>gas</b> <b>basicity</b> than the four monodentate acetone ligands in UO 2 (acetone) (4) (2 +). The uranyl v(3) frequency was also computed for uranyl coordinated by two TMGA ligands, in which the central O-ether, of TMOGA has been replaced by CH 2. The computed v(3) for UO 2 (TMGA) (2) (2 +), 950 cm(- 1), is essentially the same as that for UO 2 (TMOGA) (2) (2 +), suggesting that electron donation to uranyl from the ether of TMOGA is minor. The computed v(3) asymmetric stretching frequencies for the three actinyl complexes, UO 2 (TMOGA) (2) (2 +), NpO 2 (TMOGA) (2) (2 +) and PuO 2 (TMOGA) (2) (2 +), are comparable.

The electronic and mechanical components of the instrument are described in detail. The main capabilities of this instrument are measurement of reaction rate coefficients and of bond energies by collision induced dissociation experiments.

40|$|The binding of {{a variety}} of ligands with Fe(III) -heme(+) ion, {{prosthetic}} group of heme proteins, has been studied in the gas phase by ESI-FT-TCR mass spectrometry. The ligands have been selected among substrate molecules of heme proteins (e. g., NO, nitroso compounds) or among model compounds acting for the functional groups that are present in the protein backbone (e. g., amines, thioethers, nitriles, ketones, amides, etc.). Both the kinetic and the thermodynamic features of the addition reactions are reported. Fe(III) -heme(+) ions react faster with]one pair donor ligands as the reaction becomes increasingly thermodynamically favored (higher heme cation basicity of the ligand, HCB, namely -Delta G degrees for the ligand addition reaction). In turn HCBs correlate in general with the <b>gas</b> phase <b>basicity</b> toward the proton of the various ligands. A ligand addition equilibrium is established with weaker ligands, methanol, acetonitrile and acetone, yielding absolute HCB values, whereas ligand transfer equilibriums allowed a scale of relative (and absolute) HCBs to be constructed.

This dissertation proposes an extension to the current methods of analyzing kinetic method data. This method, termed the temperature corrected kinetic method (TCKM) is more rigorous than the current method and may potentially ease the limitations placed on the choice of reference compounds. In recognition of the temperature dependence of the <b>gas</b> phase <b>basicity</b> of the reference compounds, a temperature correction is made to these <b>gas</b> phase <b>basicities</b> using the effective temperature obtained from the kinetic method plots.

Based on tandem mass spectrometry experiments and ab initio calculations, a structure in which one nitrile is N-methylated and the second nitrile is covalently bound to the cyano carbon was determined. ^ Finally, simple instrumental modifications to a commercial triple quadrupole mass spectrometer were made in order to perform surface modifications to self-assembled monolayer (SAM) surfaces.

40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) represent a significant fraction of atmospheric aerosol. However {{the role of}} organic species emitted by aircraft (as {{a consequence of the}} incomplete combustion of fuel in the engine) in nucleation of new volatile particles still remains rather speculative and requires a much more detailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms. Measurements in aircraft exhaust plumes have shown the presence of both different non-methane VOCs (e. g. PartEmis project) and numerous organic cluster ions (MPIK-Heidelberg). However the link between detected organic gas-phase species and measured mass spectrum of cluster ions is uncertain. Unfortunately, up to now there are no models describing the thermodynamics of the formation of primary organic cluster ions in the exhaust of aircraft engines. The aim of this work is to present first results of such a model development. The model includes the block of thermodynamic data based on proton affinities and <b>gas</b> <b>basicities</b> of organic molecules and the block of non-equilibrium kinetics of the cluster ions evolution in the exhaust. The model predicts important features of the measured spectrum of positive ions in the exhaust behind aircraft.

40|$|AbstractBy {{injection}} of the proton bound homodimer [DMF·H+·DMF] of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) generated in an external ion source into {{a mixture of}} DMF and a second base within the cell of a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) spectrometer the equilibria between [DMF·H+·DMF] and the other possible proton bound dimers [DMF·H+·base] and [base·H+·base] have been studied for 13 different bases. Strongly polar bases like aliphatic amides and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) exchange both DMF in [DMF·H+·DMF] by a two step process, while the almost non-polar amines exchange only one DMF. If the base is a primary or secondary amine, the proton bound heterodimer [DMF·H+·amine] reacts further {{by the addition of}} one DMF to create a proton bound trimer [(DMF) 2 ·H+·amine]. The affinity ΔGDMFH+ of the bases towards protonated DMF relative to neutral DMF depends linearly on the difference ΔGB of the <b>gas</b> phase <b>basicity</b> of DMF and the other base, but different correlation lines are obtained for polar and non-polar ligands (ΔGDMFH+ = 0. 44 GB(base) – 375 [kJ/mol] (r = 0. 97) and ΔGDMFH+ = 0. 46 GB(base) – 397 [kJ/mol] (r = 0. 99), respectively). This different behavior is explained by a different character of the proton bridge in the heterodimers containing only polar ligands and those incorporating a non-polar ligand besides DMF. The former dimers contain a more or less symmetric proton bridge while the latter {{can be viewed as a}} protonated base solvated by DMF.

Homodesmotic reactions confirm these ΔfH° estimates for the three isomeric bipyridines 1, 3 and 4. G 3 MP 2 B 3, G 3 B 3, G 4 MP 2 and G 4 methods lead to comparable proton affinities (PA) values for the four molecules 1 − 4, in particular because of error compensation in the case of G 3 MP 2 B 3 and G 4 MP 2 results.

According to this joint experimental and theoretical approach, the gaseous reactant species, the protonated ascorbic acid,[C 6 HS 06]H+ ions, were generated by electrospray ionization (ESI) of a 10 - 3 M H 20 /CH 30 H (1 : l) ascorbic acid solution. In order to structurally characterize the gaseous [C 6 Hs 06]H+ ionic reactants, and to rationalize their gas phase degradation mechanism, we engaged in the experimental and theoretical estimate of the unknown <b>gas</b> phase <b>basicity</b> and proton affinity of AA.

Analysis of the original experimental data is conducted using the orthogonal distance regression (ODR) statistical treatment. A comparison with the proton affinities and protonation entropies obtained from variable temperature equilibrium constant measurements demonstrate deviations, which may be ascribed to random and systematic errors. Considerable random errors are associated with the extended kinetic method if the number of reference bases and the range of effective temperatures are too low. It is also confirmed that large systematic errors on proton affinities and protonation entropies are obtained when large protonation entropy is associated with the considered system.

These counter ions are only visible in the MALDI mass spectra under certain conditions, i. e., if inter-ionic proton transfer followed by evaporation of the neutrals is prevented, {{as in the case of}} metal cations. However, ion pairs can also survive the MALDI process if anions of very low <b>gas</b> phase <b>basicities</b> are used. By this means the intermediates of ion production in MALDI can be visualized. Depending on the amount of energy transfer to the analyte, which is mainly controlled by the matrix, different grades of adduct generation are observed. The analyte-, matrix- and polarity-dependant adduct distribution substantiates the hypothesis that multi-ion pairs are incorporated in the MALDI crystals and that ionization is essentially accomplished by charge separation processes. Moreover, the adduct distribution—and most probably also the charge separation efficiency—was found to be caused mainly by competition of different anionic species for coordination at the positively charged analyte sites. Furthermore, the results point to a less efficient charge separation with increasing number of ion pairs, which might be one major reason that mainly singly charged ions are obtained with MALDI...|$|R

In general, the N-methyl derivatives provided strongest bases investigated here, and, within each group of molecules, the basicity increased on going from three- to six-membered rings, con-sistent with a decrease in ring strain, with four-membered systems already surpassing or coming close to the basicity of the acyclic gauge molecule. Calculated basicities were found in a very good agreement with available experimental data, except for N–methylazetidine, where a remarkable discrepancy was re-vealed, suggesting that this system should be experimentally reassessed and its gas-phase basicity parame-ters revised.

40|$|AbstractDissociation of the amide {{bonds in}} a protonated peptide leads to N-terminal {{sequence}} fragments with cyclic structures and C-terminal sequence fragments with linear structures. The ionic fragments containing the N-terminus (bn) {{have been shown}} to be protonated oxazolones, whereas those containing the C-terminus (yn) are protonated linear peptides. The coproduced neutral fragments are cyclic peptides from the N-terminus and linear peptides from the C-terminus. A likely determinant of these structural choices is the proton affinity (PA) of the described peptide segments. This study determines the PA values of such segments (Pep), i. e., cyclic and linear dipeptides and a relevant oxazolone, based on the dissociations of proton-bound dimers [Pep + Bi]H+ in which Bi is a reference base of known PA value (Cooks kinetic method). The dissociations are assessed at different internal energies to thereby obtain both proton affinities as well as entropies of protonation. For species with comparable amino acid composition, the proton affinity (and <b>gas</b> phase <b>basicity)</b> follows the order cyclic peptide ≪ oxazolone ≈ linear peptide. This ranking is consistent with dissociation of the protonated peptide via interconverting proton-bound complexes involving N-terminal oxazolone (O) or cyclopeptide (C) segments and C-terminal linear peptide segments (L), viz. O ⋯ H+ ⋯ L ⇄ C ⋯ H+ ⋯ L. N-terminal sequence ions (bn) are formed with oxazolone structures which can efficiently compete for the proton with the linear segments. On the other hand, N-terminal neutral fragments detach as cyclic peptides, with H+ now being retained by the more basic linear segment from the C-terminus to yield yn...|$|R

In this thesis, the energetics and mechanisms of the ion/surface reactions are studied from a fundamental viewpoint. ^ As the first effort to understand the collision process, the portion of the translational energy of the projectile that is made available to the system is studied with n-butylbenzene molecular ion, a thermometer ion that has a pair of competing reactions that are sensitive to the internal energy of the ion. This method also provided a better understanding about the instrumental factors. Analytical application of this ion/surface collision was also studied with the isomeric bromotoluene molecular cation systems as the example. Large internal energy deposition made possible by surface-induced dissociation (SID) allowed better isomer discrimination compared to collision-induced dissociation (CID) and electron ionization (EI). A transhalogenation reaction was observed when the bromotoluene isomers collided with the fluorinated self-assembled monolayer (F-SAM) surfaces. Thiophene molecular cation abstracted hydrogen and methyl radicals from the surface where H• and CH 3 • are available. The reaction was believed to occur via the sputtered proton mechanism, where the proton sputtered as the projectiles are neutralized at the surface, derivatize the neutralized projectile.

Basicity constants were compared with the corresponding acyclic counterparts, NR(CH 3) (2) (R = H, Me and Ph), and were, based on triadic analysis, resolved into contributions mirroring features of both initial base and the final protonated form {{as well as their}} interplay, thus offering quantitative insight into the obtained results. In general, the N-methyl derivatives provided strongest bases investigated here, and, within each group of molecules, the basicity increased on going from three- to six-membered rings, consistent with a decrease in ring strain, with four-membered systems already surpassing or coming close to the basicity of the acyclic gauge molecule. Calculated basicities were found in a very good agreement with available experimental data, except for N-methylazetidine, where a remarkable discrepancy was revealed, suggesting that this system should be experimentally reassessed and its gas-phase basicity parameters revised. Triadic analysis showed different behaviour of individual contributions governing basicities, both among and within distinct families of molecules. It also convincingly demonstrated that, if a proper and a quantitatively accurate interpretation of observed basicity trends is desired, one should not rely only on concepts such as localized reactive hybrid orbitals (RHO) or thus derived nitrogen electron-donating ability (T. Ohwada et al., J. Org. Chem. 69 (2004) 7486), which take into account only properties of the initial base in question, but rather consider protonation reaction in its entirety...|$|R
40|$|Mgr. Jiří Míšek PhD Thesis Abstract A {{novel and}} modular {{approach}} to azahelicenes has been developed. Using [2 + 2 + 2] cyclotrimerisation of appropriate triyne {{as a key}} step, azahelicenes 83, 84 and 85 have been prepared (Scheme 1). Scheme 1. Aza[6]helicenes 84 and 85 have shown to be sufficiently configurationally stable and have been resolve into individual enantiomers by the diastereoisomeric salt crystalisation and chiral HPLC. This allowed to determine exact values of racemisation barriers for both aza[6]helicenes 84 and 85. In general, both hexacyclic derivatives 84 and 85 are stable enough {{to be used in}} asymmetric transformations or chiral sensing. The ability of aza[6]helicenes 84 and 85 to serve as chiral ligands for transition metals has been proven by the preparation and X-ray analysis of corresponding silver complexes. Interesting chiral self-recogniton properties of aza[6]helicenes 84 in gas phase have been described using mass spectrometry techniques. In order to complement information about azahelicenes <b>basicities,</b> <b>gas</b> phase proton affinities of derivatives 84 and 85 and solution phase dissociation constants of azahelicenes 83, 84 and 85 have been determined.

40|$|International audienceAlthough acetone, in DESI {{ionisation}} generally {{leads to}} protein aggregation, {{in this study}} we report unexpected multi-proton transfers to lysozyme using this aprotic solvent as a charged spray. The DESI/acetone mass spectrum of lysozyme displays (i) {{a significant increase in the}} average charge state (Zav) and (ii) an incomplete H+/Ca 2 + exchange, even though the overall contribution of cationised species is high, relative to those from spraying with a methanol/water solvent. This behavior is contrary to that expected from <b>gas</b> phase <b>basicity,</b> because GBacetone >GBmethanol. Decreasing the amount of sample deposited on the target (from 50 to 0. 050 pmole) leads to a charge state increase, as seen in ESI, but not in the extent of cationisation. Moreover, the DESI signal duration is extended with sprayed acetone even though the total ionic current is significantly lowered. With a d 6 -acetone spray, no incorporation of a deuteron occurs, and the ionization yield is strongly decreased for multi-protonated lysoi+ lysozyme. This is in contrast to that observed with a d 4 -methanol spray, which displays a distribution of 48 deuterons in the lyso 9 + ion as shown in high resolution with a LTQ/Orbitrap instrument. This unexpected behavior of the (CD 3) 2 CO spray suggests that protons do not originate from acetone. Furthermore, dry argon post-flow on the target surface results in the lysozyme signal suppression, whereas with a humid argon flow, the signal is regenerated. On the other hand, an argon stream bubbling in heavy water, yields incorporation of several deuterons. The interpretation of this behavior is explained by considering the acetone radical ions at the surface of the primary droplets (and/or offspring droplets and/or at the wet sample surface), being able to react with ambient moisture (or with traces of water adsorbed at liquid phase). Under these conditions, enough protons are produced to generate multi-charged solvated lysozyme aggregates which then become desolvated in the reduced pressure in the skimmer area...|$|R

In this paper, we describe a new analysis approach to explore the conformational space of several ligands of the a 1 -adrenoceptor and we also present the calculation of their proton affinity and basicity. For each compound a conformational search followed by a semi-empirical optimisation was performed and a selection of conformations for each ligand was subjected to further optimisation using density functional theory methods. Different positions were explored to determine the favoured site of protonation, and then, the proton affinity (in the <b>gas</b> phase) and <b>basicity</b> (using the polarisable continuum model for the aqueous solution) were calculated for each of them. In addition, an alternative method using one explicit water molecule in combination with the polarisable continuum model for aqueous solvent was explored. Moreover, the acid dissociation constant (pKa) in water of these 26 compounds was calculated because this is an important parameter for a ligand when binding to its receptor. The experimental pKa values of six of these ligands and those of two compounds with a very low and a very large pKa were used to validate the theoretical methodology...|$|R
40|$|This Ph. D. {{work was}} focused on the study of surface and {{pneumatic}} phenomena occurring in a desorption electrospray ionization-mass spectrometric (DESI) ion source. Another part of the work concerned innovative proteomics-based approaches aimed at the sensitive determination of trace hidden allergens in food. The first part of this Ph. D. work describes the successful use of innovative materials as supports for DESI investigations. A sol-gel mixture of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and octyltriethoxysilane (OTES) was used to prepare dip-coated hydrophobic xerogel films and then characterized by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM), ellipsometer, contact angle goniometry (CA) and surface free energy measurements. The DESI process was studied by using as supports functionalized surfaces obtained depositing three different silanes (3 -mercaptopropyltriethoxysilane, MTS, octyltriethoxysilane, OTES and 1 H, 1 H, 2 H, 2 H-perfluorooctyltriethoxy-silane, FOTES) from toluene solution onto standard glass slides. Surfaces were characterized by CA, AFM and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Low-molecular weight compounds were used as analytes and surface effects were discussed together with those of sprayer potential in terms of ion formation yield. A study of pneumatic effects with ESI and DESI interfaces was also carried out. For this purpose the sprayer potential was set {{in such a way that}} no ESI ionization occurs. Further confirmation about the physico-chemical processes involved in the ion formation mechanism were obtained by exploring effects of ESI parameters on the analyte ionization. In addition, it was demonstrated how different analytical responses were observed as a function of surface free energy when different solvents and applied potentials were investigated. It was confirmed that DESI phenomenon is mainly pneumatically driven and it is related to analyte solubility in the sprayed solvent. It was confirmed also found that in the DESI interface, like in ESI, ion formation is ruled by thermodynamics and proton transfer is preferred toward the species with the highest <b>gas</b> phase <b>basicity.</b> The second part of this manuscript describes a proteomic-based approach for the simultaneous determination of a number of hidden allergens in foods using characteristic peptide markers of the allergens. In detail, an innovative buffer-based extraction method for the simultaneous analysis of five nut allergens in cereals and biscuits using liquid chromatography-electrospray-linear ion trap-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-LIT-MS) was proposed. Liquid chromatography was used for the analytical separation and MS as detection technique. Chromatographic and mass spectrometric performances were evaluated according to Eurachem validation guidelines, demonstrating the performances of the novel approach in terms of sensitivity, selectivity, limits of detection as well as accuracy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} solvent {{composition}} on negative ion electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry was examined. The onset potentials for ESI {{of a series}} of chlorinated solvents and methanol were found to be within the range predicted by D. P. H. Smith, based on differences in the surface tension of the solvents used. the tendency toward electric discharge decreased with increasing percent weight of chlorine in the solvent. This effect has been attributed to an increasing propensity for electron capture for more highly chlorinated solvents. Addition of the electron scavenger gas SF 6 was even more effective at suppressing corona discharge phenomena. In a comparison of ultimate signal intensity obtainable for a test analyte in 10 % methanol, the highest signal, which was stable over the widest range of temperatures, was exhibited by chloroform compared to dichloromethane, 1, 2 -dichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride, and methanol (100 %). Chloroform, thus, is a recommended solvent for negative ion electrospray mass spectrometry (ES/MS) when solubility is not a limiting issue. Solvent polarity was shown to exhibit a profound influence on the distribution of charge states in negative ion ES/MS. For both chlorinated and nonchlorinated organic solvents, the higher the solution dielectric constant, the more the charge-state distribution is shifted toward higher charge states. These observations build on the “electrophoretic” mechanism of droplet charging. Solvents with high solution dielectric constants are considered to be most effective at stabilizing multiply charged ions (where charge separation is greatest), and they are likely to increase the level of droplet charging. Solvents with high <b>basicities</b> (<b>gas</b> phase and solution phase) and high proton affinities, yet low dielectric constants, favor lower charge states in ES mass spectra of lipid A and cardiolipin from Escherichia coli. This indicates that gas-phase processes and solvent basicity contribute much less toward ion formation than solution-phase solvation via preferred orientation of the solvent dipole...|$|R
40|$|Kinetic data is {{presented}} {{for a variety}} of ion-neutral reactions which are relevant to the atmosphere of Titan and to the chemistry occurring in interstellar clouds. The data were recorded with a Selected Ion Flow Tube (SIFT) operating at room temperature (294 ± 4 K) and at a pressure of 0. 46 Torr. Results of the recent Cassini-Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan have identified several species in the atmosphere of Titan not predicted by pre-Cassini models of the atmosphere. In order to determine the fate of three of these species (methylenimine, propionitrile and cyanodiacetylene) in Titan's ionosphere, their reactivity with the principal ions in Titan's upper ionosphere has been examined. As expected, collision rate proton transfer reactions dominate the chemistry with association channels also observed with many of the hydrocarbon ions. The results of the Cassini mission also identified several individual reactions as being of potential importance to models of Titan's atmosphere and this chemistry has also been examined. The above studies are also relevant to the interstellar medium where each of the neutral reactants have also been detected. The results of some proton transfer equilibrium studies are also presented. The <b>gas</b> phase <b>basicities</b> of propyne and acetylene have been determined to be 681 kJ mol⁻¹ and 617. 4 kJ mol⁻¹ respectively. Their relative proton affinities can be estimated from these values. A combined experimental/theoretical study of the proton affinity of cyanodiacetylene (HC₅N) has enabled this value to be estimated at 770 ± 20 kJ mol⁻¹. Details of an attempt to complete the first laboratory measurement of the crucial reaction between H₃⁺ and atomic carbon are presented. The generation of atomic carbon in sufficient quantities for reaction in the SIFT was not possible with the microwave discharge source used. Other generation methods have also been explored with the laser photolysis of carbon suboxide expected to provide a possible solution to the problems encountered. The results of an investigation into the applicability of lithium ions (Li⁺) to SIFT-MS are presented. The lithium ions associated with each of the twenty-one neutral analytes examined to form pseudo-molecular ions. The association reactions were rapid (k ~ 10 ⁻⁹ cm³ s⁻¹) for large hydrocarbons but were much slower for smaller analytes (k < 10 ⁻¹¹ cm³ s⁻¹). In order to clarify some unusual experimental observations, the effect of water molecules on the observed chemistry has been examined in detail. The measured chemistry has important consequences for the applicability of Li⁺ to SIFT-MS where the presence and detection of an identifiable ion of the analyte is essential. Details of new SIFT operating software which can be run on a modern computer are given. Mass spectra and kinetic data recorded with the new software are also presented...|$|R

A brief introduction (Chapter 1) gives a general {{overview of the}} results presented in this thesis, and is followed by five chapters which concern ion cyclotron resonance spectroscopy (ICR) studies of transition metal complexes, trifluorophosphine, and methylsilanes in the gas phase. An ancillary study on the photoionization mass spectrometry (PIMS) of the methylsilanes is also included. Chapter II discusses the gas phase ion chemistry of ([eta superscript 5] - C 5 H 5) NiNO. The dissociative bond energies, D(B-CpNi[superscript +]) [ [...] . ], are obtained by measuring equilibrium constants for reactions involving CpNi[superscript +] transfer between appropriate base pairs. A wide variety of reactions effected by CpNi[superscript +], including dehydrohalogenation, dehydration, dehydrogenation, decarbonylation, and alkylation processes are observed, and reaction mechanisms proposed. Chapter III presents a detailed study of the sequential alkylation of CpNi[superscript +] and CpFe[superscript +] by d 3 -methyl bromide. A reaction mechanism involving oxidative addition of the metal to the weak carbon-bromine [sigma]-bond is presented. The first observed example of a ligand displacement reaction involving an anionic transition metal complex, in which PF 3 displaces CO from CpCo(CO) [superscript -], is reported in Chapter IV. This result leads directly {{to the conclusion that}} PF 3 is a stronger [pi]-acceptor ligand than CO towards CpCo[superscript -] in the gas phase. Additionally, the negative ion chemistry of CpCo(CO) 2 both alone and in mixtures with various ligands is presented. The <b>gas</b> phase <b>basicity,</b> or proton affinity, of phosphorus tri-fluoride is determined in Chapter V. The results are discussed in terms of contributions from inductive and hyperconjugative interactions involving p[subscript pi]-d[subscript pi] bonding in HPF 3 [superscript +]. Ion-molecule reactions of mixtures of PF 3 with SiF 4, BF 3, SF 6, NF 3, CH 3 F, and (CH 3) 2 CO are briefly considered; various thermochemical considerations are used to determine the energetics of formation of the PF 2 [superscript +], PF 4 [superscript +], and CH 3 PF 3 [superscript +] ions observed in these mixtures. Several examples of gas phase chain reaction which proceed through ionic intermediates are presented in Chapter VI. Chain propagation reactions involve hydride and fluoride transfer between pairs of siliconium ions R 1 [superscript +] and carbonium ions R 2 [superscript +], for which D(R 1 [superscript +]-F[superscript -]) [ [...] . ] D(R 2 [superscript +]-F[superscript -]) and D(R 1 [superscript +]-H[superscript -]) [ [...] . ] D(R 2 [superscript +]-H[superscript -]).
