5|$|All {{versions}} of Perl do automatic data-typing and automatic memory management. The interpreter knows {{the type and}} storage requirements of every data object in the program; it allocates and frees storage <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> necessary using reference counting (so it cannot deallocate circular data structures without manual intervention). Legal type conversions — for example, conversions from number to string — are done automatically at run time; illegal type conversions are fatal errors.|$|E
5|$|Although Godwin {{was fond}} of his children, he was, in many ways, ill-equipped to care <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> <b>As</b> Todd explains, he was {{constantly}} annoyed by their noise, demanding silence while he worked. However, {{when he took a}} trip to Dublin to visit Wollstonecraft's sisters, he missed the girls immensely and wrote to them frequently.|$|E

However, Kelso refused {{to be involved in}} Sheldon's scheme to sell the drugs along with the other Marines, telling them all that they will lose his respect <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> Marines if they go through with the drug profiting, setting in motion the events of the game.|$|E

5|$|As {{preparations}} {{were made}} for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard. Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> they moved into larger venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate. Struggling {{to compete with the}} volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live. Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music, they decided to make the August tour their last.|$|E

5|$|Inside Olivia's mind, Walter and Peter {{find they}} {{stand out as}} invaders, {{and the people that}} {{populate}} her mind, including a vision of her step-father (Chris Bradford), seek to stop them. Walter sees someone sending a Morse code signal from William Bell's office in one of the World Trade Center buildings. After evading a crowd and a trap set by a false vision of Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), they arrive at Bell's office, where they find William waiting <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> an animated cartoon.|$|E

5|$|Not all mating {{takes place}} at the lek, since only a {{minority}} of the males attend an active lek. As alternative strategies, males can also directly pursue females ("following") or wait <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> they approached good feeding sites ("intercepting"). Males switched between the three tactics, being more likely to attend a lek when the copulation rate the previous day was high or when fewer females were available after nesting had started. Lekking rates were low in cold weather early in the season when off-lek males spent most of their time feeding.|$|E

5|$|Dušan put Syrgiannes at {{the head}} of a large Serbian force, with which he invaded Byzantine Macedonia in 1334. Syrgiannes's {{abilities}} as a general, his knowledge of the Byzantine army's dispositions and the friendships he had maintained with several local Byzantine officers resulted in the swift capture of many important Byzantine cities, including Ohrid, Prilep, Strumica, and Kastoria. The road was open for an advance towards Thessalonica, and Syrgiannes's army encamped before the walls of the city, facing a Byzantine relief force. Both sides remained encamped confronting each other for several days, but on 23 August 1334, Syrgiannes was lured away from his camp with only a few retainers and murdered by Sphrantzes Palaiologos, a Byzantine general who had defected on purpose to the Serbian camp a few days earlier. With the loss of their principal military leader, the Serbs settled for a negotiated peace with the Byzantines, which was very advantageous <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> they were left in possession of most of the cities won by Syrgiannes in northern Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|Early {{during the}} {{development}} of the TV series, Martin told major plot points to producers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. (The New York Times reported in 2011 that, at age 62, Martin was by all accounts in robust health.) Martin was confident he would have published at least The Winds of Winter before the TV series overtook him. Nevertheless, there was general concern about whether Martin would be able to stay ahead of the show. As a result, head writers Benioff and Weiss learned more future plot points from Martin in 2013 to help them set up the show's new possible seasons. This included the end stories for all the core characters. Deviations from the books' storylines are also being considered, but a two-year show hiatus to wait for new books is not an option <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> the child actors continue to grow and the show's popularity would wane. Martin indicated he would not permit another writer to finish the book series. On January 2, 2016, Martin confirmed that the sixth volume would not be published {{before the start of the}} sixth season of the HBO series.|$|E
5|$|In February 1947 Nichols was {{appointed}} Professor of Mechanics at West Point, but in April 1948, he was recalled {{to command the}} AFSWP, with the rank of major general, becoming the youngest major general in the Army at the time. Although his rank entitled him to quarters at Fort Myer, Virginia, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General Omar Bradley advised him not to ask <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> there had been criticism from some senior colonels. Nichols also became Senior Army Member of the Military Liaison Committee to the AEC, and Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff of the Army (G-3) for Atomic Energy.|$|E

5|$|Mitsuda {{was born}} in Tokuyama, Japan, on January 21, 1972, and {{was raised in the}} Kumage District of Yamaguchi Prefecture. He took piano lessons {{beginning}} at the age of five, but was more interested in sports at the time and did not take music seriously, quitting by the age of six. For a while, he wanted to become a professional golfer. While in high school, Mitsuda rediscovered music, inspired by Vangelis' Blade Runner and Henry Mancini's The Pink Panther film scores. After watching Railman, he decided to become a music composer. He became interested in PCs after his father bought him one, which was a rare item at the time. He started to program computer games and compose music <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> <b>as</b> well as take more technically oriented classes.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{continued}} to make films in the 1960s. Murphy and Huston worked together one {{more time in the}} 1960 film The Unforgiven, in which Murphy took second billing as Burt Lancaster's racist kid brother who was bent on the destruction of the Kiowa.Writer Clair Huffaker had success in a number of his works being adapted for the films, including his 1958 novel Flaming Lance being filmed as the Elvis Presley western Flaming Star. Two of his works retained their original titles when Huffaker wrote the screenplays <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> Murphy's films in 1961, Seven Ways from Sundown and Posse from Hell. Author Bob Herzberg deemed the scripts two of the best Murphy worked with in that decade. Herbert Coleman directed Posse from Hell as well as the black and white World War II drama Battle at Bloody Beach set in the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|On {{her way to}} Trawden Forest, Demdike's granddaughter, Alizon Device, {{encountered}} John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, {{and asked}} him for some pins. Seventeenth-century metal pins were handmade and relatively expensive, but they were frequently needed for magical purposes, such as in healing – particularly for treating warts – divination, and for love magic, {{which may have been}} why Alizon was so keen to get hold of them and why Law was so reluctant to sell them to her. Whether she meant to buy them, as she claimed, and Law refused to undo his pack for such a small transaction, or whether she had no money and was begging <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> <b>as</b> Law's son Abraham claimed, is unclear. A few minutes after their encounter Alizon saw Law stumble and fall, perhaps because he suffered a stroke; he managed to regain his feet and reach a nearby inn. Initially Law made no accusations against Alizon, but she appears to have been convinced of her own powers; when Abraham Law took her to visit his father {{a few days after the}} incident, she reportedly confessed and asked for his forgiveness.|$|E

5|$|Rehman {{originally}} represented England, {{and played}} {{for them at}} under-18, under-19 and under-20 levels. Becoming the first English-born Pakistani to don an England senior football shirt seemed too far away, however, {{due to lack of}} first team opportunities at Fulham. Due to his Pakistani parentage, and because he possessed dual Pakistani and British nationality, Rehman also qualified to represent Pakistan, and he eventually opted to play <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> <b>as</b> he considered it to be a more realistic option. A lot of British Asian groups were against this and wanted him to fight more for an England place to set a standard for English-Asian youth.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} release, the Landlord {{is brought to}} the triad boss, who {{increases}} his offer to HK$30 million for the baby. He finds Thongs and Octopus at the hospital, where the baby is being treated for fever. The Landlord informs the two of the triads' latest offer, but Thongs and Octopus {{are more concerned about}} the baby's welfare than the cash. However, the two agree to bring the baby to the triad boss' mansion, where the Landlord will meet them {{with the rest of the}} money. They reach the triad boss' mansion and hand over the baby reluctantly. As the trio are about to leave, they hear the baby crying <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> a blood sample is taken from his arm. Thongs and Octopus experience a flashback of the days they spent with the baby. Overcome by their feelings, they fight their way into the triad boss' private amusement park to recover the baby while the Landlord leaves with the money. Thongs almost manages to escape with the baby, but is forced to surrender when the triads threaten to hurl Octopus to his death.|$|E
5|$|The Vidiians' culture also shifts as {{a result}} of the Phage. In Vidiian society, an {{individual}} would hire a specialist, or a honatta, to find the required organs or tissues. Extended periods of contact or group meetings are strongly discouraged to prevent the further spread of the Phage, and those infected are shunned by healthy Vidiians out of fear of contamination. The Vidiians also capture other species to work <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>as</b> slaves doing manual tasks, such as mining. In the years following Voyager encounters with the Vidiians but prior to their return to Earth, a committee of alien intellectuals known as the Think Tank claimed to have cured the Phage.|$|E
