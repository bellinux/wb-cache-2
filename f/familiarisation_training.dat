40|$|The built {{environment}} consumes {{as much as}} 50 % of many countries’ primary energy resources. Building energy regulations aim to reduce building energy consumption. However, non-compliance risks efficacy of such regulations and monetary costs to the construction industry and consumers. This paper examines the profile, issues and implications of non-compliance internationally {{with a focus on}} the case of new-build dwellings in England and Wales. Non-compliance has been observed internationally in both developed and developing countries. The issues underlying the non-compliance include perceptions of triviality towards the energy efficiency regulations, piecemeal dissemination, and a lack of <b>familiarisation</b> and <b>training.</b> Such lack of compliance may paradoxically risk ever more stringent regulations being accompanied by persistent non-compliance.

40|$|This paper explores {{data from}} video-mediated remote {{interpreting}} (RI) which was originally generated {{with the aim}} of investigating and comparing the quality of the interpreting performance in onsite and remote interpreting in legal contexts. One unexpected finding of this comparison was that additions and expansions were significantly more frequent in RI, and that their frequency increased further after a phase of <b>familiarisation</b> and <b>training</b> for the participating interpreters, calling for a qualitative exploration of the motives and functions of the additions and expansions. This exploration requires an appropriate methodology. Whilst introspective data give insights into interpreting processes and the motivations guiding the interpreter’s choices, they tend to be unsystematic and incomplete. Micro-analytical approaches such as Conversation Analysis are a promising alternative, especially when enriched with social macro-variables. In line with this, the present paper has a dual aim. The primary aim is to explore the nature of additions and expansions in RI, examining especially to what extent they are indicative of interpreting problems, to what degree they are specific to the videoconference situation, what they reveal about, and how they affect the interpreter’s participation in RI.

40|$|This {{project on}} human-dog {{interaction}} was developed after bite incidents occurred involving Military Working Dogs (MWDs). Preliminary assessments (accident reports, questionnaire to the handlers, training programmes) {{led to the}} hypothesis that those incidents could find their origin in efficiency, human security and dogs' welfare problems. As a result, a new Human <b>Familiarisation</b> and <b>Training</b> Programme (HFTP) {{was set up to}} improve the training methods used by the handlers, increasing handlers' motivation and improving the relationship between the handler and the dog. A standardised evaluation procedure carried out amongst a Control Group (CG) showed: (1) efficiency problems through the assessment of obedience and protection work exercises (n= 33) : only 20 % of the dogs released their bite after the first command, only 19 % of the dogs carried out the Stand-Off correctly; (2) security problems through the assessment of a validated aggression test (n= 31) : in 69. 35 % of the cases, dogs reacted with fear-related aggression during the aggression test; (3) no major welfare problems through the behavioural and physiological measurements that were implemented in this project (n= 27) as the CG dogs were still able to adapt to environmental challenges (return to baseline of the cortisol levels, a higher posture during the second than during the first challenge). It could not be proven that the welfare of these dogs was hampered, but dog's low posture during obedience exercises indicated is was under threat. A new HFTP, based on positive and more frequent dog handler (DH) interactions and training, was subsequently set up in order to tackle the existing deficiencies. An EG was submitted to the HFTP and then underwent the same assessment as the CG. Results revealed: (1) efficiency increase through a better performance of EG teams during obedience (increase of 34. 04 %) and protection work exercises (increase of 69. 98 %) (CG: n= 33, EG: n= 33) (2) security enhancement as demonstrated by a decrease of aggressiveness (decrease of 43. 78 %) during the aggression test (CG: n= 31, EG: n= 36), (3) welfare improvements were shown by a significant increase of the EG dogs' posture during the aggression test and during obedience. Nevertheless, EG dogs, used to intense human contact, reacted worse towards kennelling than CG dogs, accustomed to little contact (CG: n= 27, EG: n= 31). This project could offer the groundwork of forthcoming research that may offer significant improvements in the way military dogs are raised and/or procured, trained, and employed - not to mention their welfare and the DH relationship(DOCMED 01) [...] FUNDP, 200...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - Protein {{consumption}} after resistance exercise potentiates muscle protein synthesis, but {{its effects}} on subsequent appetite in this context are unknown. This study examined appetite and energy intake following consumption of protein- and carbohydrate-containing drinks after resistance exercise. Methods - After <b>familiarisation,</b> 15 resistance <b>training</b> males (age 21 ± 1 years, body mass 78. 0 ± 11. 9 kg, stature 1. 78 ± 0. 07 m) completed two randomised, double-blind trials, consisting of lower-body resistance exercise, followed by consumption of a whey protein (PRO 23. 9 ± 3. 6 g protein) or dextrose (CHO 26. 5 ± 3. 8 g carbohydrate) drink in the 5 min post-exercise. An ad libitum meal was served 60 min later, with subjective appetite measured throughout. Drinks were flavoured and matched for energy content and volume.

Results - Ad libitum energy intake (PRO 3742 ± 994 kJ; CHO 4172 ± 1132 kJ; P = 0. 007) and mean eating rate (PRO 339 ± 102 kJ/min; CHO 405 ± 154 kJ/min; P = 0. 009) were lower during PRO.

40|$|Background: In cycling time trials (TT) {{the aim is}} {{to produce}} {{greatest}} average power possible {{for the duration of the}} effort; to do this an athlete must distribute their effort efficiently to ensure that they do not fatigue early but finish the event having exhausted their energy stores (Atkinson et al, 2007 : Sports Medicine, 37, 647 - 667). This distribution of effort is initially determined by conscious control (selection of a pacing strategy), but is influenced by afferent feedback from both internal sensations and environmental factors (St. Clair Gibson & Noakes, 2004 : British Journal of Sports Medicine, 38, 797 - 806). Performance in prolonged endurance exercise is inversely related to environmental temperature; this is thought to be due to central nervous system regulation of effort in response to increased core temperature. While this negative effect of hot conditions on TT performance is well established, less is known about the effect of environmental temperature on pacing during TT efforts, in particular in short t ime trials which are common in amateur cycling as well as in professional stage races such as the Grand Tours. Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of environmental temperature on performance and pacing during a simulated 16 km cycling time trial. Methods: After <b>familiarisation,</b> six moderately <b>trained</b> male cyclists (age (mean ± s) 20 ± 1 year; VO 2 max 45. 3 ± 7. 3 ml. kg- 1. min- 1, power at VO 2 max 312 ± 28 W) completed self-paced 22 -minute trials on an electromagneticallybraked cycle ergometer in hot (30 ºC, HOT) and temperate (15 ºC, COOL) conditions. Participants were instructed to complete as much work as possible during the trial and the only feedback provided was cadence and time with 5 and 1 minute remaining. Heart rate, core temperature and rate of perceived exertion were recorded at two minute intervals. Results: Mean power was slightly lower in HOT than COOL (201 ± 38 W vs. 209 ± 43 W); the difference was not significant. Core temperature and heart rate were both significantly higher in HOT than COOL (temperature: 37. 3 ± 0. 5 ºC vs. 36. 4 ± 0. 9 ºC; heart rate: 173 ± 7 bpm vs. 166 ± 11 bpm); rating of perceived exertion did not differ between the two conditions.

Powles would fly 63 sorties over Chinese territory during the course of 1951. Padden was replaced in turn by Flight Sergeants Mutch, Hood and Walker. By September, 1952, the flight had photographed sites along the Chinese coastline up to 400 nautical miles to the south-west of Hong Kong, and up to 160 nautical miles to the north-east, as well as sites up to 100 nautical miles from the coast. During the course of these flights, Powles was to set two notable records.|$|E
40|$|The {{presentation}} at the 4 th Applied Legal Storytelling Conference promoted respect for witnesses’ ownership of their narratives and explained how effective witness training can successfully avoid unethical coaching whilst remaining client-centred. Witnesses’ roles within the Common Law adversarial trial tradition were analysed, and the English and Welsh Court of Appeal’s guidance to lawyers on acceptable and unacceptable forms of trial preparation for witnesses was outlined and critiqued in its historical context and compared with other common law jurisdictions’ practices. It was argued that witnesses can be educated ethically to enhance their effectiveness in the witness box whilst respecting them as pristine evidence sources. This article develops these themes to argue that in England and Wales witness familiarisation trainers are educators rather than partisan trial strategists. Case law and research literature {{in the field of}} witness familiarisation and ethics are relied upon to support this argument. In addition, the author draws on several years’ experience of the courtroom and witness <b>familiarisation</b> <b>training</b> with witnesses of fact, expert witnesses, and criminal investigators...|$|E
40|$|Phase {{one of the}} Australian Curriculum (English, Mathematics, Science and History) {{will start}} to be {{implemented}} in years K to 10 in NSW schools in 2014. 2013 is a year for <b>familiarisation,</b> planning and <b>training</b> for NSW teachers in preparation for its introduction next year. This represents the culmination of attempts to introduce a common curriculum in Australia that began in earnest in the 1980 s. A national curriculum has met with much resistance over the years, for many reasons, {{but over the last}} decade it has received bipartisan support at the Federal level. With the cooperation of the States and Territories, the National Education Agreement of January 2009 saw the various governments in Australia commit to the development and maintenance of a national curriculum. Section two of this paper provides a brief history of the development of a common curriculum in Australia. The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA) has {{a central role in the}} development of the Australian Curriculum which is occurring in three phases. The Board of Studies NSW is then responsible for transferring that curriculum into the NSW syllabus. The Australian Curriculum is based around seven capabilities that are to be developed and applied across the curriculum: literacy; numeracy; information and communication technology competence; critical and creative thinking; ethical behaviour; and intercultural understanding. Three cross-curriculum priorities will also have an important role: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures; Asia and Australia’s engagement with Asia; and sustainability. Section three of this paper outlines the role of ACARA and the Board of Studies NSW as it relates to the Australian Curriculum. It also provides a summary of the structure of the Australian Curriculum and the timetable for its implementation in NSW. There has been much debate over the value of a national curriculum, with many arguments advanced for and against. Section four outlines some of the major reasons given for introducing a common curriculum, as well as the objections voiced by opponents. Section five briefly looks at the performance of Australian students in recent international tests, especially in light of the Federal Government’s announcement that Australia be one of the top five performing nations by 2025. Finland is often mentioned as an example of a nation whose education system is successfully doing things a little differently, and for this reason it is in included as a case study in section five. Some attention is also given to the United Kingdom, which introduced a national curriculum in the late 1980 s, but is currently conducting a review of that curriculum and looks set to alter its structure so that the teaching of the national curriculum no longer requires the majority of teaching time...|$|R
40|$|Background: Since the {{earliest}} days of aviation, simulation has been used in both flight and safety training. Altitude hypoxia has been recognised as a serious safety hazard and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) website lists 15 recent incidents between 1999 - 2004 involving hypoxia and loss of cabin pressure. It is known that hypoxia training of flight personnel aids early recognition of individual symptoms, but until now, there has been no cost-effective and easily accessible device for such aircrew safety training in Australia. This paper presents the results of validation trials of an integrated hypoxia training system for the aviation industry. Aims: To compare objective and subjective effects of hypoxia <b>familiarisation</b> <b>training</b> at simulated altitude using two different gasmix methods. Such training to increase awareness of insidious hypoxia at altitude should reduce hypoxia-related incidents and accidents. Methods: GO 2 Altitude ® hypoxia training system produces hypoxic air that is delivered by mask, with continuous recording and display of physiological parameters and cognitive functions. Results using the GO 2 Altitude ® system in 80 subjects show blood oxygen level, heart rate and breathing, impairments of cognitive performance, motor and visual sensory functions and thought block similar to those presented previously. A comprehensive report is automatically printed for each individual, stored on video CD an...|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{ensure the}} rigour of {{objective}} structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) in assessing medical students, medical school educators must educate examiners {{with a view}} to standardising examiner assessment behaviour. Delivering OSCE examiner training is a necessary yet challenging part of the OSCE process. A novel approach to implementing training for current and potential OSCE examiners was trialled by delivering large-group education sessions at major teaching hospitals. Methods: The ‘OSCE Roadshow’ comprised a short training session delivered in the context of teaching hospital ‘Grand Rounds’ to current and potential OSCE examiners. The training was developed to educate clinicians about OSCE processes, clarify the examiners’ role and required behaviours, and to review marking guides and mark allocation in an effort to standardise OSCE processes and encourage consistency in examiner marking behaviour. A short exercise allowed participants to practise marking a mock OSCE to investigate examiner marking behaviour after the training. Results: OSCE Roadshows at four metropolitan and one rural teaching hospital were well received and well attended by 171 clinicians across six sessions. Unexpectedly, medical students also attended in large numbers (n= 220). After training, participants’ average scores for the mock OSCE clustered closely around the ideal score of 28 (out of 40), and the average scores did not differ according to the levels of clinical experience. Conclusion: The OSCE Roadshow demonstrated the potential of brief <b>familiarisation</b> <b>training</b> in reaching large numbers of current and potential OSCE examiners in a time and cost-effective manner to promote standardisation of OSCE processes...|$|E
