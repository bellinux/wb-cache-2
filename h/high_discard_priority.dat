40|$|TCP {{flows from}} {{applications}} such as the web or ftp are well supported by a Guaranteed Minimum Throughput Service (GMTS), which provides a minimum network throughput to the flow and, if possible, an extra throughput. We propose a scheme for a GMTS using Admission Control (AC) that is able to provide different minimum throughput to different users and that is suitable for "standard" TCP flows. Moreover, we consider a multidomain scenario where the scheme is used {{in one of the}} domains, and we propose some mechanisms for the interconnection with neighbor domains. The whole scheme uses a small set of packet classes in a core-stateless network where each class has a different <b>discarding</b> <b>priority</b> in queues assigned to it. The AC method involves only edge nodes and uses a special probing packet flow (marked as the <b>highest</b> <b>discarding</b> <b>priority</b> class) that is sent continuously from ingress to egress through a path. The available throughput in the path is obtained at the egress using measurements of flow aggregates, and then it is sent back to the ingress. At the ingress each flow is detected using an implicit way and then it is admission controlled. If it is accepted, it receives the GMTS and its packets are marked as the lowest <b>discarding</b> <b>priority</b> classes; otherwise, it receives a best-effort service. The scheme is evaluated through simulation in a simple "bottleneck" topology using different traffic loads consisting of "standard" TCP flows that carry files of varying size...|$|R

It discriminates the cause of a packet loss in a stochastic manner, therefore has higher detection failure probability of wireless losses than ELN schemes. Furthermore, under heavy congestion or bursty-loss wireless channel condition, the probability distribution of packet losses may not follow the presumed one and thus the detection failure probability will increase.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. TCP flows {{generated}} by {{applications such as}} the web or ftp require a minimum network throughput to satisfy users. To build this service, we propose a scheme with Admission Control (AC) using a small set of packet classes in a core-stateless network. At the ingress each flow packet is marked {{as one of the}} set of classes, and within the network, each class is assigned a different <b>discarding</b> <b>priority.</b> The AC method is based on edge-to-edge per-flow measurements, and it requires flows to be sent at a minimum rate. The scheme is able to provide different throughput to different flows and protection against nonresponsive sources. We evaluate the scheme through simulation in several network topologies with different traffic loads consisting of TCP flows that carry files of varying sizes. In the simulation, TCP uses a new algorithm to keep the short-term sending rate above a minimum value. The results prove that the scheme guarantees the throughput to accepted flows and achieves high utilization of resources, similar to the ideal results of a classical hop-by-hop AC. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Nephrops trawl {{fishery is}} one of the most {{important}} fisheries in the Bay of Biscay. The fishery management essentially relies on conservation measures, a total allowed catch (TAC) for Nephrops together with a minimum landing size (MLS) and minimum trawl mesh size (70 mm stretched mesh). These measures have failed to prevent <b>high</b> <b>discard</b> levels of many species that characterize the fishery. Nephrops trawlers thus discard about half of their Nephrops catches in numbers (a third in weight) of which only 30 % survive. Nephrops discards mainly occur in younger Nephrops age groups below the MLS. This is a waste for the already overexploited Nephrops stock as well as for the fleet. Based on a bio-economic simulation model, the paper analyses the consequences of several scenarios of improving Nephrops selectivity. The potential impacts of these scenarios on Nephrops biomass, landings, discards and economic indicators (e. g. rent) are examined and a cost–benefit analysis of each scenario is carried out. We show that a better exploitation pattern would benefit fisheries that have <b>high</b> level of <b>discards.</b> Reducing non-commercial Nephrops discards leads to positive net present values of rent with better value realized from the production potential and limited short-term losses for the fishing units.

40|$|The Portuguese {{fishery in}} Portugal waters landed its {{greatest}} catches {{in the mid}} 1960 s, and landings have remained lower but steady since then. Purse seines, targeting sardines (Sardina pilchardus), had the highest catches of all fisheries from 1950 - 1999. Fish and cephalopod trawls, crustacean trawls, and multi-gear vessels form the remaining fleets. During the 1990 s, both the catch and value of most target species decreased slightly (except for octopus), due to decreasing fleet sizes in all fisheries. Official Portuguese catch statistics are compatible with ICES landing figures since the late 1980 s. Prior to this period, Portuguese catch statistics are approximately 18 % lower. We assume Portuguese discard rates are low. The Portuguese fishery is dominated by purse seines, which generally have low discard rates.

Competitive price, warranty period, brands and installment facilities are found important economic factors during the new purchase of electronic products. The actual life cycle of mobile phone, personal computers and television sets varies from 2 to 6 years. With the presence of informal sector WEEE collection and recycling, this study found that 30 % of the households were selling WEEE items to scrap collectors for economic benefits.
