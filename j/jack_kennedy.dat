500|$|In October, {{political}} experts {{predicted that}} Nixon would gain delegates in the important states of New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Nebraska during the primary season, {{scheduled to begin}} in March 1968. They noted that in the other critical state of Oregon, Ronald Reagan would have an advantage due to the proximity of his home state. Like Nixon, rival George Romney began to organize in these states. Romney officially announced his candidacy in November, prompting Nixon to step up his efforts. [...] He spent most of this period {{on the campaign trail}} in New Hampshire. Those following Nixon noted that during this period, he seemed more relaxed and easygoing than in his past political career. One commentator examined that he was not [...] "the drawn, tired figure who debated <b>Jack</b> <b>Kennedy</b> or the angry politician who conceded his California [...] defeat with such ill grace." [...] Making appearances at fundraisers in his adopted home state of New York, Nixon helped to raise $300,000 for the re-election campaign of Senator Jacob K. Javits. At the end of December, Time labeled Nixon as the [...] "man to beat." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Vice Presidential debate, Quayle {{attempted}} to dispel such allegations by comparing {{his experience with}} that of former Senator John F. Kennedy, who had also been a young political rookie when running for the presidency (Kennedy had served fourteen years in Congress to Quayle's twelve). Quayle said, [...] "I have as much experience in the Congress as <b>Jack</b> <b>Kennedy</b> did when he sought the presidency." [...] "Senator, I served with <b>Jack</b> <b>Kennedy.</b> I knew Jack Kennedy," [...] Dukakis's running mate, Lloyd Bentsen, responded. [...] "Jack Kennedy {{was a friend of}} mine.

2500|$|Bentsen was {{responsible}} {{for one of the}} most widely discussed moments of the campaign during the vice presidential televised debate with fellow Senator Dan Quayle. In answering a question about his experience, Quayle stated that he had as much political experience as John F. Kennedy had when he ran for the presidency. Bentsen retorted, [...] "Senator, I served with <b>Jack</b> <b>Kennedy.</b> I knew <b>Jack</b> <b>Kennedy.</b> <b>Jack</b> <b>Kennedy</b> was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy." [...] Quayle replied, [...] "That was really uncalled for, Senator." [...] Bentsen responded, [...] "You're the one that was making the comparison, Senator." [...] Peter Goldman and Tom Mathews wrote in The Quest for the Presidency 1988 that Bentsen [...] "was the forgotten man" [...] of the campaign until the exchange with Quayle. Thereafter, [...] his [...] "gray solidarity" [...] was [...] "made luminescent by the pallor of the other three men. However, there have been questions raised as to how well Bentsen really knew Kennedy. Some have claimed they only had a nodding acquaintance." [...] Bentsen had in fact considered in advance how to respond, because Congressman Dennis E. Eckart, who played Quayle in Bentsen's rehearsals, knew that Quayle had previously compared himself to Kennedy, so he worked it into Bentsen's debate preparation. Quayle had been prepped by Senator Bob Packwood, as Packwood served with Bentsen on the Senate Finance Committee.|$|E
