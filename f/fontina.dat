40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the prevalence and aetiology of systemic disease among patients requesting dental treatment {{in public and}} private practice. Study Design: A retrospective analysis was performed of the medical histories of 2000 patients requesting dental treatment during the year 2009. One thousand patients came from the <b>Fontiñas</b> Primary Care Oral and Dental Health Unit of the Galician Health Service (SERGAS), Spain, and the other thousand from a private clinic; both clinics were situated in Santiago de Compostela, La Coruña, Spain. The data collected were the following: demographic data (age and sex), presence or absence of systemic diseases and the nosologic categories, and drug history (type and number of drugs). Results: The prevalence of systemic disease was significantly higher among patients seen in the public system (35. 2 % in the public system versus 28. 1 % in the private system; p= 0. 003). The differences between the two systems were more marked when considering patients aged under 65 years, particularly with respect to rheumatic and endocrine-metabolic (diabetes) disorders. The prevalence of patients receiving polypharmacy (> 4 drugs/day) was significantly higher among patients seen in the public system (5. 7 % in the public system versus 2. 7 % in the private system; p= 0. 009). Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of medical disorders and of patients receiving polypharmacy among individuals requesting dental care, particularly in the public health system. Dentists must have adequate training in medical disease and must be fully integrated into primary care health teams in order to prevent or adequately resolve complications. © Medicina Oral S.

40|$|<b>Fontina</b> Protected Denomination of Origin (PDO) {{cheese is}} a full-fat semi-cooked cheese {{traditionally}} made in Northwest Italy (Aosta Valley) and manufactured from raw cow's milk. The management of cattle farms in Aosta Valley calls for seasonal migration to high pastures {{during the summer}} and the concentration of calving during the autumn {{and the beginning of the}} winter. Based on cattle physiology and given to calving seasonality, three cow lactation phases i. e. post-partum, oestrus and early gestation, can be identified and an effect could be hypothesized on average milk composition and on cheese quality. The aim of the present paper was to investigate the bacterial dynamics during <b>Fontina</b> PDO cheese manufacturing and ripening, in relation to the different lactation stages, in order to evaluate a possible correlation between microbiota and phase of lactation. For this purpose, microbial RNA analysis was carried out by RT-PCR coupled with DGGE and high-throughput sequencing. A good performance of the starter cultures was highlighted throughout <b>Fontina</b> PDO manufacturing and ripening; in fact, the starter prevailed against the autochthonous microbiota. Thus, the microbial activity, which was supposed to affect the final quality of <b>Fontina</b> PDO cheese, appeared to be strictly associated to the presence of the starter, which did not show any difference in its performance according to the different stages of cow lactation. Therefore, the results of this research highlighted a negligible correlation between the microbiota of raw milk and the organoleptic quality and typicity of <b>Fontina</b> cheese in relation to lactation seasonality...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to design and {{implement}} a new bioinformatics software which is {{able to identify the}} protein peptides from the peaks which arise from in-source or MS/MS fragmentation.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to explore the hedonic response of consumers to cheese and beer pairings by tasting in a typical social environment of consumption. Ninety-six regular beer and cheese consumers hedonically rated all fifty-six pairings of eight bottom fermented red beers and seven cheeses (Parmigiano Reggiano, <b>Fontina,</b> Taleggio, Smoked Provola, Mozzarella, Caprino, and Gorgonzola). Preference varied across samples (p. <. 0. 001). One consumer out of two appreciated all of the pairings, yet pairings with Mozzarella were liked moderately. One consumer out of three appreciated pairings with Parmigiano, were neutral in their hedonic response to pairings with <b>Fontina</b> and disliked moderately the remaining pairings but those including mozzarella were extremely unappealing to them. One consumer out of six disliked all the pairings tested but some matches with Parmigiano were liked slightly. Liking of cheese and bottom fermented red beer pairings is biased by the type of cheese partnered with beer (Parmigiano most liked and Mozzarella least liked); by the type of beer partnered with cheese, and by the liking of the sensory properties of the beers and of the cheese tasted alone. However, consumers do not simply enjoy a combination of their most preferred beer and cheese. They identified some flavors that harmonize better than do others. Also, significant correlations between mean liking scores and sensory characteristics of the fifty-six pairings were found. Beer flavor is modified largely by prior cheese consumption. Each cheese has an effect on beer flavor and this effect is consistent over the eight different beers. In general all of the cheeses decreased the intensity of fruitiness, sweetness, perceived level of carbonation, perceived level of alcoholicity, caramel-like, licorice-like and burnt notes. Bitterness, astringency, and burnt notes were reduced by most of the cheeses but <b>Fontina</b> and Smoked Provola increased the perception of these attributes. For brewers to profitably exploit the potential of the science of cheese and beer pairing the choice of a suitable beer and of a suitable cheese in terms of liking and sensory properties and the identification of a proper target audience familiar to the beers paired with cheese are essential...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of lactation stage on the microbial quality of milk for <b>fontina</b> <b>Fontina</b> cheese production, nine cheese-making days were followed in two cheese factories over a four months period: three in the first 40 days after partum (early lactation stage S 1), three in the following 40 days in the middle lactation (stage S 2) and three in the last 40 days when cows were pregnant (stage S 3). After plating, and basic chemical analysis, total microbial DNA was isolated from milk and used as template in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to study the hypervariable V 1, V 2 and V 3 regions of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene and analysed by 454 -pyrosequencing.

The present paper combines these aspects by exploring the diversity of fungal consortia inhabiting cow raw milk sampled at different altitudes in Alpine valleys of Valle d’Aosta region and used for producing the <b>Fontina</b> PDO cheese. To this aim, we performed a multilocus sequencing at barcodes commonly in use for the identification of fungal species, integrated by an intermediate cloning step when necessary.

40|$|In all, 4379 {{isolates}} from 35 products, including 24 artisanal cheeses, {{were surveyed}} {{with a view}} to identifying strains that could be used as starters in commercial dairy fermentations. Of the isolates, 38 % were classified as Lactococcus, 17 % as Enterococcus, 14 % as Streptococcus thermophilus, 12 % as mesophilic Lactobacillus, 10 % as Leuconostoc and 9 % as thermophilic Lactobacillus. Acid production by the isolates varied considerably. Of the 1582 isolates of Lactococcus and 482 isolates of mesophilic Lactobacillus tested, only 8 and 2 % respectively produced sufficient acid to lower the pH of milk to < 5 · 3 in 6 h at 30 °C. In contrast, 53, 32 and 13 % of Str. thermophilus, thermophilic Lactobacillus and Enterococcus isolates respectively reduced the pH to 5 · 3. These isolates were found only in some French, Italian and Greek cheeses. Bacteriocins were produced by 11 % of the 2257 isolates tested and 26 of them produced broad-spectrum bacteriocins which inhibited at least eight of the ten target strains used, which included lactic acid bacteria, clostridia and Listeria innocua.
