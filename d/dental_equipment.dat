25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II, {{the small number of}} full-time dental personnel were augmented by Militia officers and civilian volunteers. Although early enlistment was low, as part of the mobilisation process, in October 1939 provision was made for the establishment of dental units consisting of one dental officer, two dental mechanics and one clerk orderly, who were to be placed within three field ambulances, one casualty clearing station, two general hospitals and one convalescent depot. Initially, <b>dental</b> <b>equipment</b> and supplies were insufficient for the tasks required, with a single division requiring an estimated 50,000 fillings, 40,000 extractions and 10,000 dentures, however, personnel managed to overcome this through the acquisition of stores from local areas.|$|E

[...] Morris closed his review by saying [...] "This alleged final edition trashes the perverse morality of [...] legacy to make him the Jerry Springer of gore". Jason Anderson of the Toronto Star gave the film two out of four stars. [...] He praised Saw 3Ds plot for not being as confusing as previous films, for which he described as having to [...] "generally require an encyclopedic knowledge of the series' many plot strands" [...] in order to understand them. He thought Greutert gave the film a [...] "pulpy energy" [...] and described the film's traps and gore as having an [...] "unpretentious sensibility" [...] to films by Herschell Gordon Lewis. Alan Jones of the Radio Times gave the film four out of five stars saying, [...] "though the film initially borders on parody, once the ever-ingenious trapping begins – using fishhooks, superglue, ovens and <b>dental</b> <b>equipment</b> – the chills run on turbo drive right through to the greatest hits flashback finale". He implied that the [...] "shock scenarios" [...] were borrowed from sources such as, A Man Called Horse and the work of Lucio Fulci. Jones said the 3D did not add to the experience saying [...] "the CGI blood splatter something of a distraction to the almost Shakespearean crescendo of anguish and carnage". The film was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for [...] "Worst Eye-Gouging Misuse of 3D", but it lost to The Last Airbender.|$|E

The ratio dentists working with <b>dental</b> X-ray <b>equipment</b> from all dentists was found. The measurements of doses for dentists were performed in Subdivision of Individual Dosimetry of Radiation Protection Centre in Vilnius, Lithuania. The “Rados ” thermoluminescent dosimetry system (Finland) was used. Each dentist who was working with <b>dental</b> X-ray <b>equipment</b> got an individual dosimeter with personal number. The dose mea-surement period was once in three months. The operational dose quantities used for external exposure were the personal dose equivalent Hp (10), where minimum registered dose was 0. 01 mSv. Detailed analysis of individual doses received by dentists was performed. The number of dentists working with <b>dental</b> X-ray <b>equipment</b> increased from 68 to 237 since 1996 to 2001.

40|$|In this work, a {{spectral}} reconstruction {{methodology for}} diagnostic X-ray, using Laplace inverse transform of the attenuation, was successfully applied to <b>dental</b> X-ray <b>equipments.</b> The attenuation curves of 8 commercially available <b>dental</b> X-ray <b>equipment,</b> from 3 different manufactures (Siemens, Gnatus and Dabi Atlante), {{were obtained by}} using an ionization chamber and high purity aluminium filters, while the kV(p) was obtained with a specific meter. A computational routine was implemented in order to adjust a model function, whose inverse Laplace transform is analytically known, to the attenuation curve. This methodology was validated by comparing the reconstructed and the measured (using semiconductor detector of cadmium telluride) spectra of a given dental X-ray unit. The spectral reconstruction showed the Dabi Atlante equipments generating similar shape spectra. This is a desirable feature from clinic standpoint because it produces similar levels of image quality and dose. We observed that equipments from Siemens and Gnatus generate significantly different spectra, suggesting that, for a given operating protocol, these units will present different levels of image quality and dose. This fact claims for the necessity of individualized operating protocols that maximize image quality and dose. The proposed methodology is suitable to perform a spectral reconstruction of <b>dental</b> X-ray <b>equipments</b> from the simple measurements of attenuation curve and kV(p). The simplified experimental apparatus and {{the low level of}} technical difficulty make this methodology accessible to a broad range of users. The knowledge of the spectral distribution can help in the development of operating protocols that maximize image quality and dose. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
