5|$|Although {{ytterbium}} {{is fairly}} stable chemically, it is stored <b>in</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>containers</b> {{and in an}} inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen-filled dry box {{to protect it from}} air and moisture. All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic, although studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal. However, ytterbium compounds cause irritation to human skin and eyes, and some might be teratogenic. Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust, and the resulting fumes are hazardous. Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water, and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires.|$|E
500|$|Storage of {{the grains}} can be {{problematic}} in Africa due to potential infestation by post-harvest pests. Traditional methods of protecting stored grain include using the insecticidal properties of Neem extracts, mixing the grain with ash or sand, using vegetable oils, combining ash and oil into a soap solution or treating the cowpea pods with smoke or heat. More modern methods include storage <b>in</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>containers,</b> using gamma irradiation, or heating or freezing the grain. Temperatures of [...] kill the weevil larvae, {{leading to a}} recent push to develop cheap forms of solar heating {{that can be used}} to treat stored grain. One of the more recent developments is the use a cheap reusable double bagging system (called PICs) that asphyxiates the cowpea weevils.|$|E
2500|$|Latex {{is subject}} to rubber perishing, or [...] "dry rot", where ozone {{normally}} present in the air deteriorates the material over time, regardless of use. A latex seal is generally expected to last 1–2 years. The useful life can be extended by detaching removable seals {{when not in use}} and keeping them <b>in</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>containers.</b> They should also be kept in a cool, dark environment.|$|E
50|$|Prawn {{crackers}} {{of premium}} quality are aromatic even without additives such as monosodium glutamate (MSG) and artificial prawn flavourings {{to enhance the}} smell and taste. The fried prawn crackers may be stored <b>in</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> for up to 3 months without preservatives and up to 9 months or so depending {{on the amount of}} preservatives added.|$|R
50|$|Masyaura (or maseura) are the lentil nuggets {{prepared}} {{in most of}} the Nepalese houses during winter. It is {{prepared in}} winter and store <b>in</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> and consumed by preparing soupy curry in later days. Based on different places, masyaura are made of different lentils mixing with taro stem, yam, potatoes, cauliflowers or spinach.

2500|$|C.sativus prefers friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay-calcareous soils {{with high}} organic content. Traditional raised beds promote good drainage. Soil organic content was {{historically}} boosted via application of some [...] of manure per hectare. Afterwards, {{and with no}} further manure application, corms were planted. After a period of dormancy through the summer, the corms send up their narrow leaves and begin to bud in early autumn. Only in mid-autumn do they flower. Harvests are by necessity a speedy affair: after blossoming at dawn, flowers quickly wilt as the day passes. All plants bloom within a window {{of one or two}} weeks. Stigmas are dried quickly upon extraction and (preferably) sealed <b>in</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>containers.</b>|$|E

50|$|After being roasted {{and peeled}} (which {{improves}} the texture {{by removing the}} waxy skin), poblano peppers are preserved by either canning or freezing. Storing them <b>in</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>containers</b> keeps them for several months. When dried, the poblano becomes a broad, flat, heart-shaped pod; from this form, it is often ground into a powder used as flavoring in various dishes.|$|E

30|$|The as-prepared MAPbI 3 MW {{samples were}} placed <b>in</b> an <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> with a {{calibrated}} hygrometer and stored inside a cabinet in the dark, with a room temperature ~[*] 20  °C. In the first 4  weeks, the humidity {{was given by}} natural weather conditions, being 45  ±  5 % relative humidity (RH) in the first 3  weeks and 55  ±  5 % RH for the fourth week. From the fifth week, humid air was induced with a salt-saturated solution. For this, a small open holder with natural salt and deionized water was placed <b>in</b> the <b>airtight</b> <b>container</b> beside the samples, providing a stable atmosphere of 80  ±  2 % RH. The samples were only taken out from the cabinet for PL, Raman, and XRD characterization when required.|$|R
50|$|Seed trees {{should be}} located in stands and have a {{diameter}} of at least 40 to 70 centimeter. The fruit must be ripe since seeds of unripe fruit does not germinate. Once the seeds are harvested, they should be transported with cloth bags and extended to dry in the sun for two days of three to four hours. Seeds are orthodox and should be kept <b>in</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>containers</b> or 4 °C with moisture content of 6 to 8%.|$|E
50|$|To make lime plaster, {{limestone}} (calcium carbonate) {{is heated}} above approximately 850 °C to produce quicklime (calcium oxide). Water is then added to produce slaked lime (calcium hydroxide), which is {{sold as a}} wet putty or a white powder. Additional water is added to form a paste prior to use. The paste may be stored <b>in</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>containers.</b> When exposed to the atmosphere, the calcium hydroxide very slowly turns back into calcium carbonate through reaction with atmospheric carbon dioxide, causing the plaster to increase in strength.|$|E

30|$|Before the {{adhesion}} test, ultrasonication of {{the wires}} were done for 5  min in 2 -propanol to remove adventitious macroscopic contaminations and were dried in a desiccator.

50|$|Commercial onion powders are {{prepared}} using dehydration, freeze-drying, vacuum-shelf drying and flow drying. Some commercial onion powders are irradiated as treatment against potential microbial contamination. It readily absorbs water upon contact, so commercial varieties may be packaged <b>in</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>containers</b> with a liner atop the container. Onion powder with a moisture content of 4-5 percent {{is prone to}} caking when stored in warmer environments, with increased temperatures corresponding to a shorter time for the occurrence of caking. Of general acceptance is that commercial onion powder is around ten times stronger in flavor compared to fresh onion.|$|E
5000|$|Flowers dried in {{silica gel}} {{must be placed}} <b>in</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>{{container}}s.</b> If a container is not sealed tightly, the silica gel absorbs moisture from the air, and flowers dry too slowly or not at all. A candy tin, plastic container, coffee can, large-mouth jar or any other container with a tight-fitting lid may be used. If no containers with tight lids are available, loose tops should be sealed with tape. Silica gel is especially useful for drying fragile plants and flowers with delicate colors. Flowers that dry best in silica gel are allium, anemone, cornflower, roses, tulip and zinnia.|$|E
50|$|Before the POCIS is constructed, all the {{hardware}} {{as well as}} the sorbents and membrane must be thoroughly cleaned so that any potential interference is removed. During and after sampling the only cleaning necessary is the removal of any sediment that has adhered {{to the surface of the}} sampler. After assembly, and prior to deployment, the samplers are stored in frozen airtight containers to avoid any contamination. The samplers should be kept <b>in</b> <b>airtight</b> <b>containers</b> during transportation both to and from the sampling site so that airborne contaminants do not contaminate the sampler. It is ideal to keep the samplers cold while transporting them in order to preserve the integrity of the samples.|$|E
5000|$|Pestil, a Turkish {{word meaning}} dried fruit pulp, is best {{exemplified}} in the English term [...] "fruit leather."
