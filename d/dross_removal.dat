40|$|An {{automatic}} <b>dross</b> <b>removal</b> apparatus (10) is disclosed {{for removing}} dross {{from the surface}} of a solder bath (22) in an automated electric component handling system. A rotatable wiper blade (14) is positioned adjacent the solder bath (22) which skims the dross off of the surface prior to the dipping of a robot conveyed component into the bath. An electronic control circuit (34) causes a motor (32) to rotate the wiper arm (14) one full rotational cycle each time a pulse is received from a robot controller (44) as a component approaches the solder bath (22) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Accumulated dross {{adhered to}} the cutting support degrades the cutting {{accuracy}} and aggravates the working environment by reducing {{the efficiency of the}} dust collector. Furthermore, the cutting machine and product can be damaged by the scattering of molten metal. In this study, an attempt was made to increase the productivity of steel cutting process and improve the working environment by dross control. The dross adhesion characteristics were invested by a cutting experiment and the design concept for a <b>dross</b> <b>removal</b> machine was devised. Finally, a cutting support cleaning system and its operating algorithm were developed. The applicability of the developed system wa...|$|E
40|$|When {{aluminum}} or its alloys are melted, considerable {{amounts of}} dross are produced. The alloy type and {{the method used}} {{in the production of}} aluminum products {{play an important role in}} the amount of dross that will result as a byproduct. The current needs of the Al industry as well as economic and environmental factors demand the recovery of the pure material that is lost during <b>dross</b> <b>removal</b> by simple and efficient methods that can be applied within the foundry. Most cases of Al recovery employ methods of dross compression at high temperatures. This investigation attempts to develop a mathematical model to characterize the efficiency of the recovery process that can be implemented for any dross collection method or even compression device, facilitating the direct comparison of recovery methods...|$|E
40|$|Dross {{formation}} on {{stainless steel}} pot hardware in a galvalume bath (43. 4 wt % Zn, 55 wt % Al, 1. 6 wt % Si) {{can lead to}} significant production downtime and maintenance costs. A series of immersion tests were undertaken to understand the dross formation mechanisms and surface reactions. The various steps involved {{in the formation of}} the intermetallic dross layer and the behavior of silicon during this process were studied. Growth of the intermetallic dross layer and its composition were analyzed using SEM/EDS. The results indicated that the initial rate of dross formation was retarded due to the formation of a silicon-rich inhibition zone on the stainless steel substrate surface. However, samples immersed longer than 40 minutes showed a breakdown of the silicon-rich layer and accelerated rate of dross formation. Growth of the intermetallic dross layer continued to increase over time due to agglomeration of the dross particles formed on the roll surface. These results suggest that initial <b>dross</b> <b>removal</b> on a sink roll (by a scraper) should be carried out within 30 - 40 minutes after the roll is placed in the galvalume bath, and a strategy of more frequent (or even continuous) dross removing action with less scraping pressure may be beneficial...|$|E
40|$|Cardiovascular stents are {{biomedical}} {{devices for}} the treatment of stenosis problem in the vascular system. Stenosis can be considered as the narrowing of the vessel in a way that creates a block or contraction to blood flow. In order to overcome such blockings, stents are placed and expanded in the narrowing location. Stent manufacturing is vastly done by laser beam machining and requires a good accuracy and control of the process to be successful. Recent studies have assessed nanosecond-pulsed lasers for efficient production in terms of productivity and quality. To achieve the required properties with regard to burr and <b>dross</b> <b>removal,</b> edge rounding and surface finishing, currently chemical etching followed by electrochemical polishing is applied after laser machining. Both from the perspective of process control, speed and repeatability as well as biocompatibility, these chemical finishing processes, using concentrated acids, are far from optimal. Plasma electrolytic polishing (PeP) can provide an alternative, using biocompatible, aqueous solutions and high DC voltages of u > 200 V to establish a vapour skin around the workpiece which leads to the generation of an atmospheric plasma. Here, electrochemical and electrothermal reactions take place which remove burr and dross and smoothen the workpieces' surface. Roughness values of Ra ≥ 0. 02 μm have been achieved. This work presents the study of a novel stent manufacturing route for producing permanent stents in AISI 316 L stainless steel. The stent mesh was microcut employing a ns-pulsed fiber laser. The stents were post-processed via traditional chemical etching and PeP. The results were compared in terms of geometrical integrity and surface roughness...|$|E
