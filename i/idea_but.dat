5|$|Rhodesia {{informed}} Britain of its {{intent to}} open a Lisbon mission headed by an accredited representative, independent from the Britain Embassy in the city, in June 1965. Whitehall refused to endorse the <b>idea</b> <b>but</b> Rhodesia continued nonetheless, and later that month appointed Harry Reedman to head the mission. The British government attempted unsuccessfully to block this unilateral act—Rhodesia's first—for some months afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} first {{revealed}} by Atari at the Games Convention 2008. The game was poorly received after its release; video game critics gave it an aggregated score of 49% at Metacritic. Reviewers {{generally agreed that}} presenting a cooking guide as a video game was a good <b>idea,</b> <b>but</b> {{they found that the}} game was poorly executed and mediocre as a result.|$|E
5|$|After a {{few more}} adventures, Candide and Cacambo wander into El Dorado, a {{geographically}} isolated utopia where the streets are covered with precious stones, there exist no priests, {{and all of the}} king's jokes are funny. Candide and Cacambo stay a month in El Dorado, but Candide is still in pain without Cunégonde, and expresses to the king his wish to leave. The king points out that this is a foolish <b>idea,</b> <b>but</b> generously helps them do so. The pair continue their journey, now accompanied by one hundred red pack sheep carrying provisions and incredible sums of money, which they slowly lose or have stolen over the next few adventures.|$|E

5|$|Another major {{challenge}} {{that came up}} in production was who Monk's new psychiatrist would be. Several ideas included a woman, someone too strict or too nice, someone driven crazy by Monk's compulsions, and even someone who would give Monk scream therapy. The eventual decision came from writer Jonathan Collier, who suggested a one-armed psychiatrist. Shalhoub liked the <b>idea,</b> <b>but</b> required that they recruit an actual one-armed actor to play Dr. Sorenson. The Screen Actors Guild actually had several actors waiting to audition, and the part was given to Rick Curry.|$|E
5|$|Delsener {{presented}} {{the plan to}} Paul Simon {{in the summer of}} 1981. Simon was enthusiastic about the <b>idea,</b> <b>but</b> questioned whether it could be financially successful, especially given the poor audience attendance of his last project, the autobiographical movie One-Trick Pony. Simon's confidence had declined and he had sought treatment for depression. He questioned whether he and Art Garfunkel could work together, but contacted Garfunkel, who was vacationing in Switzerland. Garfunkel was excited about the idea, and immediately returned to the US.|$|E
5|$|Lake {{initially}} thought Microsoft was {{not particularly}} enthusiastic about the <b>idea,</b> <b>but</b> had accepted the pitch mainly because of Microsoft's vision of having Xbox One as an entertainment device with rich TV features at that time. However, as the TV show {{was not part of}} Microsoft's project, the closure of Xbox Entertainment Studios did not affect the progress of the TV show production. It was created by Lifeboat Productions, who worked closely with Remedy through Skype conversation and screenplay review. Many scenes had to be shot twice due to the game's alternate content and branching nature. Three writers from Remedy also contributed to the TV show content.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, an annoyed Kersh tells Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{that he is}} {{lifting the}} {{quarantine}} of the oil platform. Scully opposes the <b>idea</b> <b>but</b> she has no choice other than to obey. Scully then realizes that de la Cruz is immune to the black oil, and because of it, he suffered from radiation burns instead of infection. After talking to Garza, Doggett leaves to find Mulder but is attacked by Taylor. Mulder arrives and overpowers Taylor, and Mulder and Doggett barricade themselves in the communication room, and try to relay a message while the platform's crew attack the door.|$|E
5|$|Moe is {{impressed}} by Homer's ability to absorb severe punishment and suggests he take up boxing, with Moe – a former boxer himself – as his trainer and manager. Marge is annoyed by the <b>idea,</b> <b>but</b> a medical test diagnoses Homer {{with a rare}} genetic abnormality effectively rendering him near-invulnerable to knockout punches. While training, it is discovered that Homer is a weak puncher, and is extremely out of shape. Moe strategizes that Homer should stand still in the ring and let his opponents exhaust themselves trying to knock him out, and then knock them down with a tap.|$|E
5|$|On 2 June 1985, American {{conservative}} activists {{held the}} Democratic International, a symbolic meeting of anti-Communist militants, at UNITA's headquarters in Jamba. Primarily funded by Rite Aid founder Lewis Lehrman and organized by anti-communist activists Jack Abramoff and Jack Wheeler, participants included Savimbi, Adolfo Calero, {{leader of the}} Nicaraguan Contras, Pa Kao Her, Hmong Laotian rebel leader, U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, South African security forces, Abdurrahim Wardak, Afghan Mujahideen leader, Jack Wheeler, American conservative policy advocate, and many others. The Reagan administration, although unwilling to publicly support the meeting, privately expressed approval. The governments of Israel and South Africa supported the <b>idea,</b> <b>but</b> both respective countries were deemed inadvisable for hosting the conference.|$|E

5|$|On 4 May 1684 an {{earthquake}} devastated the city, severely damaging the Santa María castle. A road linking the Santa María de la Cabeza and San Antonio de la Eminencia castles was mentioned by Agustín Crame in a 1777 {{proposal for the}} defense of the city. Crame opposed the <b>idea,</b> <b>but</b> stated that if a road were built it should be a gravel one. The Santa María de la Cabeza castle was partially destroyed in a powerful earthquake felt throughout the state in 1797.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps each source has {{preserved}} {{a part of}} {{the same}} truth and Sessrúmnir was conceived of as both a ship and an afterlife location in Fólkvangr. 'A ship in a field' is a somewhat unexpected <b>idea,</b> <b>but</b> it is strongly reminiscent of the stone ships in Scandinavian burial sites. 'A ship in the field' in the mythical realm may have been conceived as a reflection of actual burial customs and vice versa. It is possible that the symbolic ship was thought of as providing some sort of beneficial property to the land, such as good seasons and peace brought on by Freyr’s mound burial in Ynglinga saga.|$|E
5|$|The Walk of Fame {{was first}} {{conceived}} in 1996 when co-founder Peter Soumalias, suggested {{the idea of}} a Walk of Fame for famous Torontonians to the board of the Toronto Entertainment District Association. They rejected his <b>idea,</b> <b>but</b> he went on to establish a Walk of Fame for Canadians in partnership with Bill Ballard, Dusty Cohl and Gary Slaight. In spite of a lack of funds, research and no media plan, the first class of inductees was inducted in 1998. Canada's Walk of Fame has become a popular tourist attraction in Toronto and has been named the number one Canadian recognition event.|$|E

5|$|Written by David Banks, {{the story}} {{involved}} the Sixth Doctor and Peri encountering the Master in Ancient Crete, {{as well as}} a contingent of Cybermen. David Banks, who had played the Cyber Leader in three serials in the early 1980s, submitted this storyline around the time that ‘Attack Of The Cybermen’ entered production in 1984. Script editor Eric Saward liked the <b>idea,</b> <b>but</b> felt that it would prove too expensive to film.|$|E
5|$|Between 1913 and 1916, Gerhard Heilmann {{published}} {{a series of}} articles in the journal of the Danish Ornithological Society, all heavily illustrated and dealing with the question of the origin of birds. He first proposed the idea of a popular treatise on bird evolution in 1912 to Otto Helms, the editor of the journal of the Danish Ornithological Society. Helms supported the <b>idea</b> <b>but</b> recommended that Heilmann first seek professional advice on the topic. Despite the lack of formal training in zoology, Heilmann succeeded in amassing his research with the help of several others, including the expert in prehistoric animals at the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen, Adolf Herluf Winge, and the biologist D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson of the University of Dundee. Winge, though initially showing interest in Heilmann's work, later proved {{to be a source of}} frustration by refusing to engage Heilmann in depth on various scientific queries. Heilmann eventually broke off contact, expressing some bitterness at the apparent change of heart, which Heilmann later ascribed to Winge's belief in Lamarckism.|$|E
5|$|Calvin's {{authority}} was practically uncontested during his final years, and he enjoyed an international {{reputation as a}} reformer distinct from Martin Luther. Initially, Luther and Calvin had mutual respect for each other. A doctrinal conflict had developed between Luther and Zurich reformer Huldrych Zwingli on {{the interpretation of the}} eucharist. Calvin's opinion on the issue forced Luther to place him in Zwingli's camp. Calvin actively participated in the polemics that were exchanged between the Lutheran and Reformed branches of the Reformation movement. At the same time, Calvin was dismayed by the lack of unity among the reformers. He took steps toward rapprochement with Bullinger by signing the Consensus Tigurinus, a concordat between the Zurich and Geneva churches. He reached out to England when Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer called for an ecumenical synod of all the evangelical churches. Calvin praised the <b>idea,</b> <b>but</b> ultimately Cranmer was unable to bring it to fruition.|$|E

5|$|Coghlan {{was elected}} to the Kimberley town council in 1897. The {{following}} year Colonel Frederick Schermbrucker's youngest daughter Gertrude Mary Schermbrucker, described as an attractive and sociable woman, arrived to stay at the house Coghlan shared with his sister and mother. Coghlan married Gertrude in Wynberg, a southern suburb of Cape Town, on 10 January 1899. Around this time Coghlan's friend Percy Ross Frames invited him to join him in Bulawayo, one of the main settlements in Rhodesia, as Matabeleland, Mashonaland and the adjoining areas were now collectively called. Coghlan was receptive to the <b>idea,</b> <b>but</b> was compelled to stay in Kimberley by the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899. Kimberley was besieged by Boer forces, cut off by rail and telephone, from 14 October until its relief by General John French on 15 February 1900.|$|E
5|$|De Montfort's {{coalition}} {{began to}} quickly fragment, Henry regained his {{freedom of movement}} and renewed chaos spread across England. Henry appealed to Louis of France for arbitration in the dispute, as had been {{laid out in the}} Treaty of Kingston; de Montfort was initially hostile to this <b>idea,</b> <b>but,</b> as war became more likely again, he decided to agree to French arbitration as well. Henry went to Paris in person, accompanied by de Montfort's representatives. Initially de Montfort's legal arguments held sway, but in January 1264, Louis announced the Mise of Amiens, condemning the rebels, upholding the King's rights and annulling the Provisions of Oxford. Louis had strong views of his own on the rights of kings over those of barons, but was also influenced by his wife, Margaret, who was Eleanor's sister, and by the Pope. Leaving Eleanor in Paris to assemble mercenary reinforcements, Henry returned to England in February 1264, where violence was brewing in response to the unpopular French decision.|$|E
5|$|Desertion had {{continued}} to be a problem for the 24th Infantry, a de facto segregated unit. Statistics compiled by the Eighth Army found the 25th Infantry Division had to detain 116 deserters from the 25th Infantry throughout August, compared to 15 from the 27th Infantry and 12 from the 35th Infantry. The regiment had already been criticized for its poor performance at the Battle of Sangju several weeks earlier. In late August, Kean began investigating the unit's behavior, and found its poor performance was starting to bring other units of the division down as well. Kean considered the regiment a weak link in the chain, and after its poor performance at the battles of Battle Mountain and Haman, he suggested to Walker that the regiment be disbanded and its troops used as replacements for other units in the field. Virtually all of the officers and enlisted men in the regiment were supportive of this <b>idea,</b> <b>but</b> Walker declined, feeling he could not afford to lose a regiment.|$|E
