Among these functions, enrollment which captures fingerprint {{image from the}} sensor plays an important role. A reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> people put their fingerprints on a mirror to scan can affect to the result in the searching and verifying process. Regarding to verification function, there are several techniques to match fingerprints such as correlation-based matching, minutiae-based matching, ridge feature-based matching and minutiae-based algorithm. However, the most popular algorithm was minutiae based matching algorithm due to its efficiency and accuracy.|$|E
500|$|In {{the wake}} of the shooting, Democrats and Republicans both called for a cooling of {{political}} rhetoric and a return to bipartisanship. On the eve of the shooting, Giffords had written to a Republican friend, Trey Grayson, Secretary of State of Kentucky, saying, [...] "we need {{to figure out how to}} tone our rhetoric and partisanship down." [...] In March 2010, Giffords had expressed concern about the use of crosshairs on a national midterm election map on Sarah Palin's campaign webpage denoting targeted congressional seats, including Giffords's, in Arizona's 8th district. Shortly after the map's posting and the subsequent vandalizing of her office that month, Giffords said, [...] "We're in Sarah Palin's 'targeted' list, but the thing <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> she has it depicted, we're in the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. When people do that, they've got to realize that there are consequences to that action." [...] At that point in the interview, however, the interviewer said, [...] "campaign rhetoric and war rhetoric have been interchangeable for years." [...] The image was removed from Palin's [...] "takebackthe20" [...] website following the January shootings. Palin responded to her critics in a January 12 video, rejecting the notion that anyone other than the gunman could bear any responsibility for the Tucson shooting, and accusing the press of manufacturing a [...] "blood libel" [...] to blame her and the right wing for the attacks.|$|E

40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{feature of}} {{the past half century}} has been the emergence, diversification and diffusion of managerial environmentalism across large parts of the globe. This article examines how globalisation has been implicated in these internationalisation processes and outcomes. A central theme <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> in which aspects of managerial environmentalism have diffused are complex, multi-dimensional and defy simple generalisations about the constituent mechanisms and spatialities. Moreover, the international diffusion of environmental innovations has been shaped by the domestic geographies of place, resulting in uneven and hybrid patterns of managerial environmentalism across space...|$|R
50|$|Despite these shocks, Mike Murphy {{who played}} {{thirteen}} {{season with the}} Kings and was their captain for seven years, replaced Quinn as coach. The Kings made the playoffs {{in the next two}} seasons, but they were unable {{to get out of the}} first round. After a slow start to the 1987-88 season, Murphy was fired and Vachon coached the team for one game until promoting AHL's New Haven Nighthawks coach Robbie Ftorek as new head coach. Part of <b>the</b> problem <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> playoffs <b>were</b> structured (teams were bracketed and seeded by division) made it very likely that they would have to get past either the powerful Oilers or Calgary Flames (or both) to reach the Conference Finals. In all, the Kings faced either the Oilers or the Flames in the playoffs four times during the 1980s.|$|R
2500|$|An {{alternative}} argument <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to [...] "save the environment" [...] {{and prevent}} famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues website: 'Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'. However, {{critics argue that}} a trade-off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable, and that pesticides simply replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation. The UNEP introduces the Push–pull agricultural pest management technique which involves intercropping that uses plant aromas to repel or push away pests while pulling in or attracting the right insects. [...] "The implementation of push-pull in eastern Africa has significantly increased maize yields and the combined cultivation of N-fixing forage crops has enriched the soil and has also provided farmers with feed for livestock. With increased livestock operations, the farmers are able to produce meat, milk and other dairy products and they use the manure as organic fertiliser that returns nutrients to the fields." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 5 February the {{original}} English version treaty and its translation into Māori were put before {{a gathering of}} northern chiefs inside a large marquee on the lawn in front of Busby's house at Waitangi. Hobson read the treaty aloud in English and Williams read his Māori version. Māori chiefs (rangatira) then debated the treaty for five hours, much of which was recorded and translated by the Paihia missionary station printer, William Colenso. Rewa, a Catholic chief, who had {{been influenced by the}} French Catholic Bishop Pompallier, said [...] "The Māori people don't want a governor! We aren't European. It's true that we've sold some of our lands. But this country is still ours! We chiefs govern this land of our ancestors". Moka 'Kainga-mataa' argued that all land unjustly purchased by Europeans should be returned. Whai asked: [...] "Yesterday I was cursed by a white man. <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> things are going to be?". Protestant Chiefs such as Hōne Heke, Pumuka, Te Wharerahi, Tamati Waka Nene and his brother Eruera Maihi Patuone were accepting of the Governor. Hōne Heke said: ...|$|E

Dobson may have delivered Bush his victories in Ohio and Florida." [...] Further, [...] "He's already leveraging his new power. When a thank-you call came from the White House, Dobson issued the staffer a blunt warning that Bush 'needs to be more aggressive' about pressing the religious right's pro-life, anti-gay rights agenda, or it would 'pay a price in four years.'...Dobson has sometimes complained that the Republican Party may take the votes of social conservatives for granted, and has suggested that evangelicals may withhold support from the GOP if the party does not more strongly support conservative family issues: [...] "Does the Republican Party want our votes, no string attached — to court us every two years, and then to say, 'Don't call me, I'll call you' — and not to care about the moral law of the universe? ...

Foregrounding the theoretical andmethodological approaches, the study examines how the strategies handed specifically to sons influence their personal and educational histories.

[...] One <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>was</b> not a predetermined principle of the universe, but rather an establishment of men, of the ancient sages who described it in the Confucianist classic works. [...] These works provided for <b>the</b> <b>Way,</b> which was divided by rites (rei 礼) and music (gaku 楽). [...] The former gave social order, while the latter was inspiration for the heart. [...] In this it directly allowed for the flow of human emotions, something denied by the moralist philosophy of Song Confucianism. [...] Sorai argued for the opposite, allowing one to be enriched through music and poetry. [...] As {{a result of his}} teachings in putting emphasis on literature as a fundamental form of human expression, Chinese writing would begin to thrive in Japan, becoming an accepted artistic pursuit.
