40|$|Non-point source {{pollution}} {{is widely considered}} {{a serious threat to}} drinking water. Eutrophication in Chinese watershed is mainly due to nitrogen and phosphorus output from agricultural source. Taihu Lake is a typical eutrophic lake in China, a basin representative {{for the study of the}} temporal-spatial characteristics of pollution loading of nitrogen and phosphorus to provide scientific basis for reasonable estimation and targeted control measures of nitrogen and phosphorus loss. Based on data from nitrogen and phosphorus loss in agricultural land, livestock breeding, <b>domestic</b> <b>discharge</b> and aquaculture, this study calculated the levels of nitrogen and phosphorus comprehensive loss risk for each pollution source. Using the superposition of ArcGIS raster data, we also described the spatial distribution of nitrogen and phosphorus comprehensive loss risk by the formula of comprehensive loss risk. The results showed that critical risk areas of nitrogen and phosphorus loss mainly originated from livestock breeding and agricultural land during flood period in Tiaoxi watershed. Agricultural land and livestock breeding sources formed major parts of nitrogen loss, accounting for 30. 85 % and 36. 18 %, respectively, while phosphorus loss mainly originated from livestock breeding (56. 28 %). During non-flood period, integrated management of livestock breeding and <b>domestic</b> <b>discharge</b> requires much attention to control nitrogen and phosphorus loss in the critical risk area. Finally, it is of great practical significance to propose spatial-temporal targeted measurements to control nitrogen and phosphorus pollution in watershed for various periods and different areas...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePhthalates and alkylphenols are toxics {{classified}} as endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs). They {{are of particular}} concern due to their ubiquity and generally higher levels found in the environment comparatively to other EDCs. Industrial and <b>domestic</b> <b>discharges</b> might {{affect the quality of}} receiving waters by discharging organic matter and contaminants through treated waters and combined sewer overflows. Historically, industrial discharges are often considered as the principal vector of pollution in urban areas. If this observation was true in the past for some contaminants, no current data are today available to compare the quality of industrial and <b>domestic</b> <b>discharges</b> as regards EDCs. In this context, a total of 45 domestic samples as well as 101 industrial samples were collected from different sites, including 14 residential and 33 industrial facilities. This study focuses more specifically on 4 phthalates and 2 alkylphenols, among the most commonly studied congeners. A particular attention was also given to routine wastewater quality parameters. For most substances, wastewaters from the different sites were heavily contaminated; they display concentrations up to 1200. μg/l for di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate and between 10 and 100. μg/l for diethyl phthalate and nonylphenol. Overall, for the majority of compounds, the industrial contribution to the flux of contaminant reaching the wastewater treatment plants ranges between 1 and 3 %. The data generated during this work constitutes one of the first studies conducted in Europe on industrial fluxes for a variety of sectors of activity. The study of the wastewater contribution was used to better predict the industrial and domestic contributions at the scale of a huge conurbation heavily urbanized but with a weak industrial cover, illustrated by Paris.

The non-point source pollution was quantified by export coefficient method, and the <b>domestic</b> <b>discharge</b> was estimated by demand-supply method. The statistic and dynamic analyses based on the investigation data of 1998 showed that the major nitrogen flows in this region were river loads, fertilizer and feedstuff imports, atmospheric deposition, animal excretes' degradation and volatilization, and the processes relating to burning and other emissions. In 1998, about 40 % of nitrogen was detained in the system, which could be accumulated and yield potential environmental problems. The nitrogen export in this region was mainly by rivers, accounted for about 57 %.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the water quality of the large young tropical Bakun hydroelectric reservoir in Sarawak, Malaysia, {{and the influence of}} the outflow on the downstream river during wet and dry seasons. Water quality was determined at five stations in the reservoir at three different depths and one downstream station. The results show that seasons impacted the water quality of the Bakun Reservoir, particularly in the deeper water column. Significantly lower turbidity, SRP, and TP were found during the wet season. At 3 – 6 [*]m, the oxygen content fell below 5 [*]mg/L and hypoxia was also recorded. Low NO 2 [...] N, NO 3 [...] N, and SRP and high BOD 5, OKN, and TP were observed in the reservoir indicating organic pollution. Active logging activities and the dam construction upstream resulted in water quality deterioration. The outflow decreased the temperature, DO, and pH and increased the turbidity and TSS downstream. Elevated organic matter and nutrients downstream are attributable to <b>domestic</b> <b>discharge</b> along the river. This study shows that the downstream river was affected by the discharge through the turbines, the spillway operations, and domestic waste.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that excess nutrients change the {{dissolved inorganic carbon}} (DIC) system, which drives air-sea carbon dioxide (CO 2) exchanges, so {{the changes in the}} DIC system will then affect the oceans' carbon (C) biogeochemistry cycle. This study explores the impact of external nutrient input from 2006 to 2011 on the DIC system and air-sea CO 2 exchanges in four largest coastal seas in China. The result demonstrates that external nutrient input significantly facilitates the biological uptake of DIC and promotes air-sea CO 2 fluxes in coastal waters. The C sink caused by nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) input for the Bohai Sea, the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea account for 46, 45, 11, and 59 % of the total C sink, respectively. The excess nutrient input significantly changes the DIC system and C biogeochemistry cycle process in China Ocean. Up to a certain point, these effects are positive in increasing DIC levels and enhancing air-sea CO 2 exchanges. However, the DIC levels may decrease if the nutrient increase is greater than the capacity of the oceanic C system. In addition, the other impact factors, including sea level, winds, water, and air temperatures, and various human activities, such as agriculture, industry, and <b>domestic</b> <b>discharge,</b> also affect N and P transport, air-sea CO 2 fluxes, and C biogeochemistry cycles...|$|E

The existing techniques for removal of these contaminants such as reverse osmosis and ion exchange suffer a few disadvantages and hence, thrust to develop efficient techniques for the removal have been ever increasing. Adsorption based on the use of nanoadsorbents is promising being cost effective and based on the ease of operation. The present work furnishes a detailed overview on nanoadsorbents for removal of lead from water. The various nanoadsorbents covered in the analysis include alumina, anatase, carbon nanotubes, chitosan, copper, iron and zinc oxide, magnetite, nanoclay and zirconium nanoparticles. The review also gives an insight into the synthesis and characterization of nanoadsorbents followed by guidelines on optimum operating parameters {{to be used in the}} removal process for maximizing the extent of removal. The typical optimum conditions established based on the critical analysis of literature are pH 6, contact time 60 min and optimum adsorbent dose dependent on the nanomaterials. Comparison of different nanoparticles revealed that titanium oxide and hematite nanoparticles are the best, giving 100 % removal efficiency for lead ions. The sequestration was mainly dependent on adsorbent dose that has to be kept optimum to yield adequate surface area and number of adsorption sites.

There is currently a lack of studies that quantify water quality variation (deterioration or otherwise) due to both socio-economic and infrastructure development in a catchment. This paper investigates the causes of water quality changes over the rapid urbanization period of 1985 – 2009 in the Shenzhen River catchment, China and examines the changes in relation to infrastructure development and socio-economic policies. The results indicate that the water quality deteriorated rapidly during the earlier urbanization stages before gradually improving over recent years, and that rapid increases in <b>domestic</b> <b>discharge</b> were the major causes of water quality deterioration. Although construction of additional wastewater infrastructure can significantly improve water quality, it was unable to dispose all of the wastewater in the catchment. However, it was found that socio-economic measures can significantly improve water quality by decreasing pollutant load per gross regional production (GRP) or increasing labor productivity. Our findings suggest that sustainable development during urbanization is possible, provided that: (1) the wastewater infrastructure should be constructed timely and revitalized regularly in line with urbanization, and wastewater treatment facilities should be upgraded to improve their nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies; (2) administrative regulation policies, economic incentives and financial policies should be implemented to encourage industries to prevent or reduce the pollution at the source; (3) the environmental awareness and education level of local population should be increased; (4) planners from various sectors should consult each other and adapt an integrated planning approach for socio-economic and wastewater infrastructure development...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Marmara Denizi’nin doğusunda yer alan Gemlik Körfezi en derin yeri - 113 m olan yarı kapalı bir havza olup, drenaj alanında pek çok endüstriyel ve evsel atık alması sebebiyle antropojenik kirlilik riski altındadır. Bu çalışmada Gemlik Körfezi’nin  - 71 ile - 105 m aralığındaki su derinliğinden alınmış üç karotta yapılan jeokimyasal analizlerle ağır metal kirliliğinin ve organik kirliliğin boyutları ve zamansal gelişimi araştırılmıştır.   Karotlarda µ-XRF karot tarayıcısı ile çoklu element, çok sensörlü karot log alıcısı (MSCL) fiziksel özellikler ve ICP-MS yöntemi ile ağır metaller analiz edilmiştir. Çökellerin toplam organik karbon (TOK) ve toplam inorganik karbon (TİK) analizleri ile organik maddenin δ 13 C ve δ 15 N, C ve N element analizleri yapılmıştır. Karotların tarihlendirilmesi radyonüklid (210 Pb ve 137 Cs) ve hızlandırılmış kütle spektrometresi (AMS) radyokarbon yöntemiyle gerçekleştirilmiştir.   İnce taneli homojen koyu gri-kahverengi çamurdan oluşan M- 17, MNTKI- 13 ve M- 18 karotları, sırasıyla son 250, 260 ve 200 yılı kapsamakta ve üst kısımlarında 1985 – 1995 yılları arasında çökelmiş kokolit laminalı bir birim içermektedir. Ayrıca MNTKI- 13 karotunda 1930 ve M- 18 karotunda 1985 yıllarında olasılıkla Kocadere deltasından taşınmış iki kütle akması birimi tespit edilmiştir. Kütle akması birimlerinde Ti ve Zr zenginleşmesine karşın; Th, La, Nb ve Rb’deki fakirleşme, kaba silt tane boyundaki bu birimlerin rutil, titanit ve zirkon gibi ağır mineral içeriğinin zengin olmasından ileri gelmektedir. Karotların kokolit laminalı biriminde % 4 ’e varan TOK içeriğindeki artış, burada yaklaşık olarak 1965 ’te oluşan oksijensiz dip suyu koşullarından hemen sonra başlamıştır. Yaklaşık 1995 sonrası çökellerdeki organik maddenin kökeninin karasal olmasına karşın; 1985 - 1995 yılları arasındaki organik maddenin kökeni denizeldir. Kokolitli birimin çökelmesine de neden olan bu dönemdeki alg patlamaları, endüstriyel ve evsel atık kaynaklı besin elementi (P ve N) girdisine ve ötrifikasyona işaret etmektedir. δ 15 N değerleri 1930 ’dan günümüze olan zaman aralığında göreceli olarak daha yüksektir. Özellikle son 40 yılda körfezde bol besin elementi olduğunun bilinmesine karşın; nitrojen izotop oranının yüksek olması denitrifikasyon sürecinin baskın olduğunu göstermektedir. K, Rb ve Li’un 1840 - 1980 yılları arasında göreceli olarak zenginleşmesi, bu yıllar  arasında yüksek erozyona ve kurak bir iklime; son 40 yıl içerisinde fakirleşmesi ise  azalan erozyona ve yağışlı bir iklime işaret etmektedir. As, Sb, Bi, Cu, Pb, Zn ve Cd  ve Th konsantrasyonları yaklaşık 1975 yılından itibaren antropojenik olarak hızla  artmaktadır. Cd önemli derecede zenginleşme gösterirken (zenginleşme faktörü, EFmax= 6), Zn ve Sb orta derecede zenginleşme göstermektedir (EF= 2. 2 – 2. 3). Metal değerleri 1980 ’den itibaren eşik değerlerini aşmaya başlamıştır.  Mo, 1965 ’ten itibaren, kısmen anoksik dip suyu koşullarının gelişmesi ve antropojenik girdilerle birlikte artmaya başlamış ve çok yüksek miktarda zenginleşme göstermiştir (EFmax= 50). Sb, S (EFmax = 3. 6) ve U (EFmax= 3) da kısmen diyajenetik, kısmen antropojenik kirlilik nedeniyle Mo’e göre daha az zenginleşmiştir. Gemlik Gulf, {{which is}} a semi- {{enclosed}} inlet with maximum depth of 113 m {{in the eastern part}} of the Sea of Marmara, is under the risk of anthropogenic pollution from different industrial and municipial pollution sources in its drainage basin.   In this study, the extent and temporal evolution of the heavy metal and organic pollution were investigated using a wide range of analyses of three cores located in different water depths ranging from - 71 m to - 105 m. The cores were analyzed using µ-XRF core Scanner, Multi Sensor Core Logger (MSCL)  and Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP – MS) for sediment metal concentrations. analysis of δ 13 C and δ 15 N mass spectrometric and elemental C and N analyses of bulk oganic matter and total organic carbon (TOC) and inorganic carbon (TIC) analyses of sediments were also carried out. The chronology of the cores were determined using radionuclide (210 Pb and 137 Cs) and Accelarated Mass Spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon analyses.   Cores M- 17, MNTKI- 13 and M- 18 cover the last 250, 260 and 200 years, respectively, and include dark grey brown clayey – silt sized mud with some red brown mass-flow units and a coccolithopore ooze-bearing unit near the top. The lithological and geochemical correlation between the cores was done according to the chronology of the core MNTKI – 13 that was determined from radionuclide dating. Therefore, age models for the two other cores (M 17 and M 18) were created according to these correlations. Thus, the bottom of the coccolithopore ooze-bearing unit was dated at 1985 and it was revealed that this unit deposited between 1985 and 1995. Two mass flow units identified in cores M- 18 and MNTKI- 13 were probably originated from Kocadere delta during years 1985 and 1930 respectively.  The gray brown unit of MNTKI - 13 deposited between years 1945 and 1950.  Enrichment of Ti and Zr and depletion of other lithophile crustal elements (Th, La, Nb ve Rb) in these units are due to heavy mineral (rutile, titanite and zirconium) -rich silt size detrital influx. The red – brown color and high magnetic susceptibility values (25 uSI) of the mass units indicate the presence of Fe-oxides. These mass flow units are characterized with increasing trends of elements such as K, Ti, Mn, Zr and Fe that are associated with terrigenous material input, whereas decreasing trends of Ca and total inorganic carbon content due to dilution of biogenic material input. On the other hand, the Ca and total inorganic carbon content increase in coccolithopore ooze bearing unit, whereas K, Ti, Mn, Zr and Fe content as well as magnetic susceptibility values decrease due to dominance of biogenic material deposition.   The gray – brown unit of MNTKI- 13 which deposited between the years 1945 and 1950 reveal low magnetic susceptibility, high Ca and total inorganic carbon content and is distinguished in the radiography as a dark color band. These results indicate that this unit is a diagenetic carbonate cementation zone.     Increase of TOC to 4 % in the coccolith ooze unit follows the establishment anoxia in bottom waters soon after the year 1965.   The origin of organic matter that was deposited after the year 1995 is of terrestrial end-member, whereas it is of marine end – member in the coccolithopore unit that deposited between the years 1985. A high content of terrestrial organic matter (C/N = 50) is transported to the centre of the Gemlik Bay with the 1930 mass flow. Algal blooms after 1985 indicate high nutrient input (N and P) and eutrophication caused by industrial and <b>domestic</b> <b>discharge</b> to the gulf as well as sewage and fertilizers used in agricultural activities. High organic matter content and nutrient input to the Gemlik gulf leading to the organic pollution since 1930 s is caused mainly by the industries in the gulf area such as Sümerbank Filature Factory built in 1937, olive oil and fertilizer production. Therefore the anoxic conditions that developed at the sea bottom after the year 1965 {{which is a}}lso revealed by the Mn depletion onset in sediments, is caused by the high rate of organic matter input from industrial and domestic effluents that are consuming oxygen in water column coupled with the natural stratification in water column preventing the renewal of oxygen. Hence, both of these processes lead to oxygen deficiency in bottom waters. δ 15 N content is relatively higher after year 1930, reaching maximum values during the last 40 years in the gulf. If the oxygen levels decrease in bottom waters and the conditions become reducing, the reduction of NO 3 - leads the remnant NO 3 - to be enriched in δ 15 N. Because the denitrifying bacteria prefers the light isotope to heavy isotope (isotope fractionation) for its metabolism during nitrate reduction reaction (denitrification) for obtaining energy. Such high δ 15 N values indicate that denitrification has been an important process after 1930 s until present, in relation with anoxic bottom water conditions. Low δ 15 N contents between the years 1830 – 1930 (‰ 2, 5 - 3) indicate that the denitrification was not so common and the bottom waters were relatively more oxic. The oxygen content in waters increases due to decreasing temperatures and consequently increasing rate of water circulation. Relative enrichment of K, Rb and Li during 1840 - 1980 indicate that relatively arid climatic conditions prevented forest expansion and lead to the erosion that transported these lithophile elements to the gulf within clastic minerals. Their depletion during the last 40 years indicate more humid climate conditions and more precipitation leading to forest expansion and less erosion. These results are supported by climatic δ 18 O data from a lake in the central part of Turkey. Similarly K, Ti, Fe and Zr show decreasing trends during approximately 1915 according to the XRF data, in cores M- 17 and M- 18. This depletion period is correlated with the increasing precipitation identified from the δ 18 O curve from the same lake.   The origin of crustal - derived, lithophile elements in Gemlik Gulf sediments such as Rb, Li, Ti, Nb, La, Zr and Th is felsic gneiss and granites of Paleozoic - Triassic age of Karakaya unit and granites of Oligo - Miocene age that outcrop in Armutlu peninsula and the surrounding region.   Concentrations of heavy metals such as As, Sb, Bi, Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd and Th increase abruptly after 1975 due to anthropogenic pollution. Cd is significantly enriched (enrichment faxtor, EFmax= 6) among them, whereas the enrichments of Zn and Sb are moderate (EF= 2. 2 – 2. 3), with all heavy metal concentrations rising above treshold level (EF= 2) starting around the year 1980. Geoaccumulation index (Igeo) values show a similar trend with enrichment factors (EFs) according to the onset of pollution. Geoaccumulation index of Cd reaches above extreme pollution treshold (Igeo= 5) in 1995 followed by a decreasing trend up to present.   Mo (EFmax= 50), together with U (EFmax = 3), S (EFmax = 3. 6), and Sb, is highly enriched after 1965, which is due in part to diagenesis under anoxic bottom waters and in part to increased anthropogenic pollution. Calcophile semi-metals such as S, As, Zn, and Sb as well as elements such as Mo and U become enriched under anoxic bottom water conditions. Increasing total organic carbon content (up to 4 % in coccolithopore ooze bearing unit) as well as depletion of Mn in sediments indicate development of anoxic conditions. Thus, Mo, and S shows high correlation with total organic carbon content. The onset of enrichment of Mo and S indicate the onset of anoxic bottom water conditions development as 1965. Because Mo, and uranium precipitates with sulphur and become enriched in sediments under reducing conditions.   The enrichment of Cd, Mo and Th in Gemlik Gulf sediments is also possibliy, partially caused by the usage of phosphate fertilizers for agriculture in Gemlik Gulf drainage basin. Because phosphate fertilizers contain these elements. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSeagrass {{ecosystems}} in Bahrain {{contribute significantly}} to the productivity of local fisheries and provide food sources and nursery grounds for vulnerable species. However, these ecosystems are under continuous threats from anthropogenic pressures, including reclamation and dredging, industrial effluents, <b>domestic</b> <b>discharges,</b> and brine water from desalination plants. Surveying seagrass beds and associated macro-fauna is required to contribute to management and conservation effort of these sensitive ecosystems. Macrobenthic assemblages were sampled from two seagrass beds off the western and eastern coasts of Bahrain that are subjected to different environmental conditions. Differences in structure and composition among the assemblages between the two sampling sites were detected. The western site was numerically dominated by crustaceans, while molluscs were the dominant group in the eastern site. Salinity and sediments were the main environmental factors responsible for explaining 44 % of the community patterns in the study areas. Seagrass cover was 95 ± 3. 6 % and 78 ± 7. 4 % for the western and eastern sites, respectively. Implications of this study may allow better decisions to be made concerning the conservation of seagrass ecosystems in Bahrain...|$|R

40|$|The {{ecological}} footprint (EF) is an accepted worldwide method {{for the evaluation}} of environmental sustainability. However, its utility is limited by the existence of a series of shortcomings in the methodology such as the only-partial inclusion of human generated wastes. To improve the ability of the footprint method to evaluate environmental sustainability, a new footprint-based indicator - the &# 39;Waste Absorption Footprint&# 39; (WAF) - has been proposed. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to test this methodological approach by evaluating the sustainability of the water environment in the Taihu Lake Basin, in densely populated eastern China. Applying the WAF method indicates that anthropogenic discharges of wastes have imposed an absorption pressure on the local water system such that the local water environment is increasingly unsustainable. Furthermore, nitrogen and phosphorus are identified as more critical wastes than organic substances, while <b>domestic</b> <b>discharges</b> are shown to be more important sources compared with those from industry and agriculture, which therefore should be the focus of environmental management and pollution control initiatives. It is demonstrated that the WAF method can provide a wealth of information that can be used for reference by local water environmental management authorities...|$|R
40|$|The {{volcanic}} lakes {{constitute the}} {{major part of}} the lacustrine environments in Central Italy. In the last century these lakes were exposed to various disturbances caused by urbanization, agricultural activities, <b>domestic</b> <b>discharges</b> and recreational use. Due to their small watershed and great water renewal time, they can be considered as very sensitive to degradation and their major suffering problems are eutrophication, hypolimnetic deoxygenation, meromixis and lowering of water level. We report here some biological data collected in the last decades on five volcanic lakes with the aim of evaluating their present trophic status by means of some biological parameters of all the lacustrine communities useful to detect water quality changes and suggesting some monitoring guidelines to enhance conservation and managing policies of the lakes. In a trophic scale, Lake Bracciano revealed the most oligotrophic characteristics, due to the presence of an o-ring waste water collecting system, its large size and depth, and the strong hydrodynamism. Lake Martignano follows in the rank, with some symptoms of stress in the hypolimnion due to a marked summer deoxygenation. Lake Vico, which showed in the past decades a mesotrophic condition with clear signals of increasing trophy and oxygen depletion in the profundal, have a trend towards meso-eutrophy. Lake Albano showed meso-eutrophic conditions with the total absence of fauna below 120 m depth due to a meromictic status, also evidentiated by palaeolimnological studies. Finally, in the 70 ies Lake Nemi was subject to <b>domestic</b> waste water <b>discharges</b> which led to heavy eutrophication with dramatic algal blooms and fish kills. In the last decade a partial improvement in many ecological characteristics of the lake seemed to take place, following the discharges diversion...|$|R

Since its {{inception}} {{in the beginning of}} the twentieth century, plasma science has grown to a major field of science. Lowtemperature plasma sources and gas discharges can be found in domestic and industrial applications, and can be observed in nature as well. Examples of <b>domestic</b> <b>discharges</b> are those used in lighting and plasma display panels (PDP's). In industry, plasma sources are widely used for materials processing. Applications range from feature etching in the fabrication of electronic devices, deposition, wettability improvement and bio-medical treatment. Due to its scientific and industrial relevance, plasma and gas discharge science has been exercised both experimentally as well as theoretically for a long time. More recently, the advent of electronic computing has made it possible to obtain approximate numerical solutions for sources that were too complex to handle analytically before. After providing a brief, general introduction to plasma science, we will discuss the state of the art in plasma modelling at Eindhoven university.
