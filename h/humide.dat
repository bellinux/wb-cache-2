40|$|Abstract: We use {{fish and}} {{environmental}} data from 40 wetlands of the Laurentian Great Lakes {{to develop the}} Wetland Fish Index (WFI), a tool {{that can be used}} to assess the quality of coastal marshes. A partial canonical correspondence analysis was used to ordinate fish species along multidimensional environmental axes that accounted for anthropogenic disturbance based on temperature, conductivity, and the presence of pollutants (e. g., suspended solids and primary nu-trients). Compared with other measures of fish habitat quality (e. g., Shannon–Wiener diversity index and species rich-ness), the WFI was the only index that was significantly related to the degree of water quality degradation and wetlands condition, as indicated by an independent index of wetland quality, the Water Quality Index (WQI). WQI ranks sites according to deterioration in water quality and is statistically related to the degree of land-use alteration in wetland watersheds. We demonstrate the usefulness of the WFI for detecting intrawetland variation between two sites in a degraded urban wetland, Frenchman’s Bay, Lake Ontario, and to distinguish the heavily impacted wetlands in lower Green Bay from the less-impacted marshes in middle and upper Green Bay, Lake Michigan. This was accom-plished by using only published fish data without corresponding environmental variables.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Beaver dams are {{ubiquitous}} in subarctic wetlands, where runoff {{in the flat}} terrain is highly prone to changes as the stream courses are modified by beaver activities. Depending {{on the state of}} preservation, stream flow can overtop or funnel through gaps in the dams, leak {{from the bottom of the}} dams or seep through the entire structure. Peak and low flows are regulated by these dams to a varying extent. The formation of beaver ponds causes local flooding, while the open water surfaces of the ponds increase water loss from the wetlands. Water spilled from the dams may cause diversion channels to produce complex drainage patterns. Comparing the water balance of basins with and without a beaver dam at its outlet confirms that the dammed basin lost more water to evaporation, suppressed the outflow and increased the basin water storage. Key words: beaver, wetland, beaver dam, stream flow, basin storage, wetland drainage, Subarctic RÉSUMÉ.

40|$|Abstract: Ombrotrophic peatlands in North America are {{harvested}} mainly for horticultural purposes. Following intense exploitation, these peatlands are generally abandoned to natural regeneration. The abandoned sites usually remain barren or poorly revegetated {{by a few}} vascular plants for several years. The post-harvested sites are not usually recolonized by Sphagnutn species (peat mosses), which are the key species to restore peatland functions. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop restoration techniques for post-harvested peatlands. The experiments centred on Sphagnum reintroduction, since peat mosses are responsible for peat accumulation. Vegetative Sphagnutn fragments were used as diaspores. Various methods of Sphagnum reintroduction were tested to ensure reliable colonization. A microrelief formed of ridges and depressions provided humid conditions in depressions which favored Sphagnutn establishment. Reintroducing Sphagtlritrl diaspores in combination with such companion plant species as Eriophorurn arzgrtstifoliutn also had a positive effect on the survival of peat mosses. A phosphorus amendment led to improved establishment of Sphagna and companion plant species. Key words: Sphagtlurn, microtopography, companion species, phosphorus, fertilization.

40|$|Abstract: We {{analyzed}} {{data from}} coastal wetlands across the Laurentian Great Lakes to identify fish assemblage patterns and relationships to habitat, watershed condition, and regional setting. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordi-nation of electrofishing catch-per-effort data revealed an overriding geographic and anthropogenic stressor gradient that ap-peared to structure fish composition via impacts on water clarity and vegetation structure. Wetlands in Lakes Erie and Michigan with agricultural watersheds, turbid water, little submerged vegetation, and {{a preponderance of}} generalist, toler-ant fishes occupied one end of this gradient, while wetlands in Lake Superior with largely natural watersheds, clear water, abundant submerged vegetation, and diverse fishes occupied the other. Fish composition was also related to wetland mor-phology, hydrology, exposure, and substrate, but this was only evident within low-disturbance wetlands. Anthropogenic stress appears to homogenize fish composition among wetlands and mask other fish–habitat associations. Because land use is strongly spatially patterned across the Great Lakes and aquatic vegetation is a key habitat element that responds to both biogeography and disturbance, {{it is difficult to}} disentangle natural from anthropogenic drivers of coastal wetland fish com-position.

40|$|Abstract The {{ability to}} {{simulate}} {{characteristics of the}} diurnal cycle of rainfall occurrence, and its evolution over the seasons {{is important to the}} forecasting of hydrological impacts resulting from land-use and climate changes within the humid tropics. This stochastic modelling study uses a generalized linear model (GLM) solution to second-order Markov chain models, as these discrete models are better at describing binary occurrence processes on an hourly time-scale than continuous-time approaches such as stochastic state-space models. We show that transition probabilities derived by the Markov chain method need to be time-varying rather than stationary to simulate the evolution of the diurnal cycle of rainfall occurrence over a Southeast Asian monsoon sequence. The conceptual and pragmatic links between discrete diurnal processes and continuous processes occurring over seasonal periods are thereby simulated within the same model.

This paper synthesises a decade of published and unpublished research at Scotty Creek {{for the purpose of}} presenting the major factors that should be considered by water scientists and managers as a basis for modelling and management strategies. Five main topics are covered: (1) peatlands of lower Liard River valley; (2) hydrological characteristics of permafrost plateaus, flat bogs, and channel fens; (3) runoff generation on permafrost plateaus; (4) conceptual model of peatland hydrology; and (5) climate warming and implications for basin runoff. This synthesis offers a practical understanding of the hydrology of wetland-dominated basins with discontinuous permafrost. It also offers insight into how landscape changes resulting from climate or human disturbances may influence the basin hydrograph.

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{research}} suggests that wetland abundance surrounding lakes, fish trophic position, and fish community composition may influence the bioavailability of mercury (Hg) to fish. To compare {{the importance of these}} spatial and biological factors to chemical factors known to influence bioavailability, we determined the relationship between 24 lake traits and Hg concentrations in yellow perch (Perca flavescens; whole fish samples) for 43 northern Wisconsin lakes. Independent variables included biological traits such as fish trophic position and body condition, spatial traits such as lake hydrologic position and surrounding wetland abundance, and chemical traits such as pH and water color. The strongest predictor of fish Hg levels was pH (R 2 = 0. 42; p < 0. 002). Of the biological traits measured, yellow perch body condition explained significant additional variation (final R 2 = 0. 54; p = 0. 024). Trophic position explained limited variability and population abundance of planktivores and piscivores were not correlated to perch Hg levels. Regression tree models indicated that small lakes with greater than 6 % wetland in their watershed have moderately elevated fish Hg levels. Our results indicate that within-lake chemistry and fish growth patterns are stronger correlates of Hg levels in yellow perch than spatial traits, trophic position, or fish community attributes.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Climate {{change will}} be an {{important}} issue facing Arctic areas in the coming decades since climate models are projecting warmer and wetter conditions for many northern regions. From a hydrological perspective, critical issues include a shortened snow cover season, changes in winter snow cover properties, and changes in the timing and volume of snowmelt runoff. To assess the impacts of projected temperature and precipitation changes on the hydrology of a small Arctic headwater basin, the distributed hydrological model WATFLOOD was used in conjunction with selected Global Circulation Models (GCMs) and future climate scenarios. It was found that the hydrological model simulated basin runoff adequately either with input climate data collected in the study area or with input data from a long-term climate station located approximately 50 km south. WATFLOOD was then used to predict future runoff using GCM outputs for the 2040 – 69 and 2070 – 99 time periods. The results gave dates of first and peak runoff that were, on average, up to 25 days earlier than in current (1961 – 90) climate. In addition, future runoff and evaporation volumes increased by up to 48 % as a result of projected increases in temperature and precipitation. Furthermore, a large number of simulated years showed midwinter melt periods, which will have major impacts on snowpack properties and, in turn, on human, animal, and plant life in this region.

The objective {{of this study was}} to compare 2 methods for measuring dry and wet atmospheric depositions in the urban environment, namely DAD and WAD (direct method) /TAD and WAD (indirect method). Trace metals (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pt and V) were used to carry out this comparison. TAD was collected with two open polyethylene containers (72 × 54 × 21 cm), while WAD was collected by means of an automated rainwater collector and DAD was determined from both air measurements (recorded by an air sampler) and 7 Be deposition velocities. This comparison showed a significant difference between the two methods. Dry and wet fluxes varied widely from one month to the next. Zn and Cu were the most abundant elements in both dry and wet depositions. The mean contribution of DAD to the total atmospheric deposition during this 9 -month study was significant for Zn, Cu and V (about 25 %) as well as for Pb (approx. 60 %). For this relatively unpolluted urban residential catchment, the contribution of atmospheric deposition to global load at the catchment outlet was low, between 10 % and 20 % for Zn, Cu, V and Pb, 25 % for Cr and about 30 % for Ni. For other urban sites exhibiting high atmospheric pollution however, the atmospheric contribution to the global pollution load could be much greater.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Eighty-three stream reaches were sampled {{from four}} {{drainage}} basins {{in the central}} portions of Axel Heiberg and Ellesmere Islands. The streams included small snowmelt tributaries, those flowing through wetlands, pond outflows, glacial meltwaters, and large trunk rivers, some of which had become braided in their lower portions. Larger channels tended to be quite turbid, and macroscopic algae were negligible in these reaches because they lack adequate light and hard substrata for attachment. The overall stream macroalgal flora was relatively small (15 species) {{compared to that of}} other regions of the North American tundra. Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta accounted for all but one species. The most widespread species was the colonial cyanobacterium, Nostoc commune. Only Scytonema mirabile (Cyanophyta) was a new addition to the stream macroalgal flora of arctic North America. The number of species per stream reach ranged from 0 to 5, with a mean of 1. 3. The amount of stream bottom covered by macroalgae was 0 to 75 %, with an average of ca. 5 %. Both species number and percent cover per reach are relatively low.

This study describes the nature, magnitude, and distribution of disturbances caused by airboat trails over floating mat fen wetlands in the Tanana Flats near Fairbanks, Alaska. Airphoto interpretation showed over 300 km of airboat trails by 1995, with a 15 % expansion of the trail system since 1989. Field sampling was done at 30 trail and adjacent control sites along this trail system to assess changes in hydrology, soils, and vegetation. Water velocities in the trails at two-thirds of the sites were at least {{an order of magnitude}} greater than velocities of less than 1. 5 cm sec- 1 in the control areas. On average, 30 cm of the 0. 5 – 0. 75 m thick floating mat has been removed or eroded by airboat traffic at the sampling locations. Nearly all emergent floating mat vegetation has been destroyed (5 % cover remaining on average) so that the trails resemble a highly visible open water stream channel 2 – 3 m wide through the floating mats. Although the recovery and regrowth potential of floating mats in trails is high, recovery is unlikely in trails with continuing use.

Mais cette succession et cette persistance n'ont pas affecté significativement la stationnarité de la série hydrologique. Aux échelles mensuelles et saisonnière, l'influence du barrage se manifeste par une inversion du régime hydrologique caractérisée par une hausse des débits hivernaux et une baisse des débits printaniers. Cette influence se traduit aussi par une baisse significative du débit maximum mensuel mais une hausse du débit minimum mensuel. Il en résulte une diminution du coefficient d'immodération. A l'échelle journalière, le barrage modifie la période d'occurrence des débits extrêmes minimums et maximums. Il provoque la diminution significative des débits extrêmes minimums et maximums. Mais l'écrêtement des crues est modéré pour les débits de récurrence= 10 ans. L'impact le plus significatif du barrage de Matawin est sans nul doute l'inversion du régime hydrologique dont les conséquences morphologiques et biologiques ne sont pas encore documentées dans la littérature scientifique canadienne. Cette inversion résulte du faible écoulement hivernal et d'une forte production de l'énergie électrique pendant la saison froide. Few studies have characterized {{the effect of}} dams on the hydrologic regime of rivers in Quebec. This is rather strange given {{the large number of}} hydroelectric dams that have been constructed in the province. To shed some light on the environmental impact of these dams, this paper aims at describing and quantifying the effect of the Matawin River dam on the hydrologic regime of the river on an annual, seasonal and daily basis. The Matawin River is located north of the St-Lawrence River and is a tributary of the St-Maurice River. The Matawin dam was built in 1929 by Shawinigan Water and Power Co. mainly to supply the Gabelle hydroelectric dam on the Saint-Maurice River. The dam is 26 m high and the storage capacity of the reservoir is 348, 000, 000 m 3 when full. The catchment area of the dam is 4070 km 2. To assess the effect of the dam, we used various statistical methods to compare discharge time series over 60 years as measured at two gauging stations on the river. One of the stations is located upstream whereas the other one is located downstream from the Matawin dam. The upstream drainage basin covers an area of 1390 km 2. No major tributaries are found between the two gauging stations, thus allowing us to ascertain the effect of the Matawin dam on the natural hydrologic regime of the river at different time scales. On the annual scale, no difference in the mean annual discharge is observed upstream and downstream from the dam. The specific discharges upstream and downstream from the river's dam are respectively 17. 2 and 17. 1 l/s/km 2. This is to be expected because the reservoir is used neither for irrigation nor for derivation. However, analysis of the interannual variability of mean annual discharges, using the Hanning low pass filter, reveals that wet and dry periods are far more persistent downstream than upstream from the dam. This persistence can be seen to occur within the two dry periods of 1930 - 1960 and of 1980 - 1990 and during the wet period from 1965 to 1980. This persistence does not affect the stationarity of the discharge time series downstream from the dam as no significant changes are detected from Mann-Kendall and Pettitt statistical tests. On the monthly and seasonal scale, the comparison of the time of occurrence of maximum and minimum discharges shows a strong inversion within the hydrologic regime. Upstream from the dam, the maximum and minimum discharges are measured respectively during the spring and the winter. Downstream from the dam, the regime is inverted, with the maximum and minimum discharges being measured in winter and spring respectively. This inversion is closely associated with the production of hydroelectricity during the cold winter season when large amounts of water are released from the reservoir. Furthermore, is worth noticing that the monthly and seasonal coefficients of maximum discharge are lowered downstream from the dam whereas those for the minimum discharge remain similar. On a daily basis, the comparison of dates of occurrence for the lowest annual discharge downstream and upstream from the dam shows these are found at different times of the year. Upstream from the dam, most of the minimum daily discharges are measured in August and September whereas downstream from the dam, they largely occur during April. On the other hand, the maximum daily discharges are recorded almost exclusively in April and May upstream from the dam but can occur throughout the year downstream from it, with a marginally larger number in January. These results are relevant for the assessment of the environmental impacts of dams on rivers in the province of Quebec. For example, the inversion of maximum and minimum discharges is likely to have an important impact on the winter habitat characteristics by increasing the area of suitable habitat, but also by increasing the likelihood of sediment being transported during periods where usually only sporadic transport events occur. In the future, it would be crucial to understand the exact effect of the inversion on the morphological and biological components of the river dynamics...|$|R
