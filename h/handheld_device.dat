5|$|Subsequent {{hardware}} units under Iwata's tenure, {{including the}} Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, {{were not as}} successful as the DS and Wii, and Nintendo's finances took a downward turn starting in 2010. During the development phase of the 3DS, a <b>handheld</b> <b>device</b> featuring stereoscopic 3D without the need of accessories, Iwata stated that his background in technology helped keep Nintendo's engineers in line. It was hoped that the successor to the Nintendo DS would reinvigorate the company after profits began declining. However, weak sales upon {{the release of the}} Nintendo 3DS caused the company's stock to fall by 12percent on July29, 2011. The console's poor sales prompted a price cut in August from its launch price of US$250 to US$170. Sales of the 3DS continually fell below expectations. Iwata later admitted in 2014 that he misread the market and did not appropriately account for changing lifestyles since the launch of the Wii. He continually placed focus on family-oriented games despite declining popularity.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons is an American {{animated}} television sitcom {{created by}} Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series is a satirical parody {{of a middle}} class American lifestyle epitomized by its eponymous family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. It {{is set in the}} fictional town of Springfield, and lampoons American culture, society and television, and many aspects of the human condition. The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with producer James L.Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19, 1987 and after a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became a hit series for Fox. The growing popularity of the series motivated video game developers to create video games based on the series. Two pinball machines have also been produced; one self-titled, that was only made available for a limited time after the first season finale (1990) and The Simpsons Pinball Party (2003). Additionally, several <b>handheld</b> <b>device</b> games have been released, such as Bartman: Avenger of Evil (1990) and Bart Simpson's Cupcake Crisis (1991).|$|E

25|$|A {{string trimmer}} is a powered <b>handheld</b> <b>device</b> {{that uses a}} {{flexible}} monofilament line instead of a blade for cutting grass and trimming other plants near objects. It consists of a cutting head {{at the end of}} a long shaft with a handle or handles and sometimes a shoulder strap. String trimmers powered by an internal combustion engine have the engine on the opposite end of the shaft from the cutting head while electric string trimmers typically have an electric motor in the cutting head. Used frequently in lawn and garden care, the string trimmer is more popularly known by the brandnames Weedeater or Weedwhacker. The string trimmer was invented in 1971 by George Ballas of Houston, Texas.|$|E

Handheld keyboards allow the user the ability to move around a room or to lean back on a chair while also being able to type in front or away from the computer.

25|$|In {{most parts}} of the world, {{medication}} is dispensed in blister packaging. It is relatively simple to equip blister packages with printed conductive trace grids. These grids are then connected to an electronic module. The electronic monitor records the time a trace has been broken and can then transmit this information to an NFC smart phone or even be GSM enabled to transmit the information immediately if a suitable data network is available. A more reasonable solution at the moment would be to connect the package to a hub, <b>handheld</b> <b>device,</b> tablet or smart watch via low power Bluetooth. In this case the package data would be sent whenever the medication blister is in close proximity to the bluetooth receiver. It avoids the huge effort required to equip every single blister with a SIM module and expensive monthly data subscription.|$|E
25|$|The Qbot is a <b>handheld</b> <b>device</b> which park {{guests can}} rent for the day.

Currently the Qband is used at waterparks around the world including: Six Flags Hurricane Harbor, Splish Splash, Wet'nWild Sydney, Raging Waters San Dimas.

40|$|Abstract – In {{the present}} era, the {{requirement}} for informa-tion on portable, <b>handheld</b> <b>devices</b> is demanding the realiza-tion of increasingly complex applications for increasingly small and ubiquitous devices. This trend promotes the migra-tion of technologies that were originally developed for desktop computers to <b>handheld</b> <b>devices.</b> With the onset of Grid com-puting, users of <b>handheld</b> <b>devices</b> can accomplish much more complex tasks, by accessing the processing and storage re-sources of the Grid. This paper describes the development, features, and performance aspects of a Grid-enabled analysis environment designed for <b>handheld</b> <b>devices.</b> We also describe some differences in technologies required to run these applica-tions on desktop machines and hand held devices. In addition, we propose a prototype agent-based distributed architecture for carrying out high-speed analysis of physics data on hand-held devices...|$|R

A <b>handheld</b> <b>device</b> called Delivery Information Acquisition Device (DIAD) was created to record and upload delivery information to the UPS network immediately upon pickup by every UPS driver. In 1992, UPS began tracking all ground shipments electronically. In 1994, UPS.com debuted, and provided the perfect interface to make what was primarily internal operational information available for customer access. In 1995, UPS acquired SonicAir to offer service parts logistics and compete with Choice Logistics. In the same year UPS launched UPS Logistics Group to facilitate global supply chain management solutions and consulting for customer needs. In 1997, a walkout by the 185,000 members of the Teamsters shut down UPS for 16 days. In 1998, UPS Capital was established to enable companies to grow their business through a comprehensive menu of integrated financial services through UPS. UPS acquired Challenge Air in 1999 to expand its operations in Latin America.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the limited}} success, Nintendo would press ahead with 3D {{development}} into the 1990s. Gunpei Yokoi, {{creator of the}} Game Boy <b>handheld</b> <b>device</b> and popular Metroid video game, developed a new 3D device for Nintendo called the Virtual Boy. It was a portable table-top system consisting of goggles and a controller that used a spinning disc to achieve full stereoscopic monochrome 3D. Released in 1995, the Virtual Boy sold fewer than a million units, spawning only 22 compatible game titles, and was widely {{considered to be a}} commercial failure. Shigeru Miyamoto, known for his work on popular game franchises such as Mario and The Legend of Zelda, commented in a 2011 interview that he felt conflicted about Yokoi's decision to use wire-frame models for 3D and suggested that the product may not have been marketed correctly. The failure of the Virtual Boy left many at Nintendo doubting the viability of 3D gaming. Despite this, Nintendo continued to investigate the incorporation of 3D technology into other products.|$|E
