This damper uses a spring element (often rubber in automobile engines) and an <b>inertia</b> <b>ring</b> that is typically tuned to the first torsional natural frequency of the crankshaft. This type of damper reduces the vibration at specific engine speeds when an excitation torque excites the first natural frequency of the crankshaft, but not at other speeds. This type of damper is analogous to the tuned mass dampers used in skyscrapers to reduce the building motion during an earthquake.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe pulleys of an {{automotive}} {{front engine}} accessory drive are driven in rotation by a poly-V belt itself {{driven by the}} crankshaft pulley. This driving pulley is often used as a torsional vibration damper (TVD) for the crankshaft. Three elements compose the pulley: the hub, a rubber <b>ring</b> and an <b>inertia</b> steel <b>ring</b> with v-ribs on its outer diameter. Although the crankshaft torsional vibrations are dampen, they are transmitted to the belt transmission and therefore to the driven accessories. Hence, recent developments have conducted to add a decoupling function to these pulleys. The decoupling is realized by an other rubber ring. The TVD pulley components are designed in order to dampen crankshaft vibrations over a given frequency range, i. e. stiffness and damping characteristics are determined for the rubber ring. These expected characteristics have to be checked after manufacturing for product certification but also to give some real measured data input for simulation models. An experimental characterization method is presented and discussed for {{the determination of the}} stiffness and damping coefficients of the rubber rings used in such pulley. The test rig developed is temperature controlled in order to show the influence of the temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{inertia welding}} (IW) of Ti 64 was {{examined}} {{in terms of}} the microstructure and mechanical properties. The microstructure from two smalls scale <b>inertia</b> welded <b>rings</b> was observed using SEM. These microstructures were assessed in both the Hoop and Radial directions. Mechanical testing including micro-hardness, mechanical threshold and crack propagation testing, fracture toughness, tensile testing and low cycle testing was evaluated. The results show that the microstructures of both IW and LFW Ti 64 are very similar with various weld zones being observed. The micro-hardness is far superior in the weld zone to that of the parent material. The most significant controlling parameter of the microstructure is the cooling rate. The Tensile properties of both IW and LFW Ti 64 are superior to that of the parent and failure will not occur within the weld, although the LCF behaviour was not as favourable in IW. Crack growth rate is slower in the hoop direction than radial direction although this trend is reversed at increased temperature due to a switch from transgranular to intergranular crack growth. This work suggests that IW of Ti 64 shows promise, although further work is required on larger scale welds before the manufacture of fan disks made from IW Ti 64 can be substantiated. ...|$|R
40|$|The Pioneer Saturn {{infrared}} radiometer viewed Saturn's rings at 20 - and 45 -µm wavelength under several conditions of illumination. The data are analyzed to infer radial locations of major ring boundaries, temperatures and temperature gradients, and normal optical depths. Error bounds on the above inferred quantities are given. Most ring boundaries are defined to ± 0. 01 R_s(1 R_s≡ 6 × 10 ^ 4 km) {{and are in}} good agreement with those inferred from the imaging photopolarimeter experiment. Temperatures generally decrease with radial distance from the planet. A significant temperature gradient exists from the colder north (unilluminated) side of the rings to the warmer south side. The gradient appears to be steepest on the south side. Ring optical depths are greater than some previously published values and are approximately 0. 1 for the Cassini division and the C ring. In addition, the C ring optical depth decreases towards the planet. The temperature drop during eclipse is ≳ 10 K, implying low thermal <b>inertia</b> for the <b>ring</b> particles. Titan's 45 -µm brightness temperature is 75 ± 5 K, in good agreement with earth-based observations...|$|R
40|$|The {{thermal inertia}} values of Saturn's main rings (the A, B, and C rings and the Cassini division) are derived by {{applying}} our thermal model to azimuthally scanned spectra {{taken by the}} Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS). Model fits show the thermal <b>inertia</b> of <b>ring</b> particles to be 16, 13, 20, and 11 Jm^- 2 K^- 1 s^- 1 / 2 for the A, B, and C rings, and the Cassini division, respectively. However, there are systematic deviations between modeled and observed temperatures in Saturn's shadow depending on solar phase angle, and these deviations indicate that the apparent thermal inertia increases with solar phase angle. This dependence {{is likely to be}} explained if large slowly spinning particles have lower thermal inertia values than those for small fast spinning particles because the thermal emission of slow rotators is relatively stronger than that of fast rotators at low phase and vise versa. Additional parameter fits, which assume that slow and fast rotators have different thermal inertia values, show the derived thermal inertia values of slow (fast) rotators to be 8 (77), 8 (27), 9 (34), 5 (55) Jm^- 2 K^- 1 s^- 1 / 2 for the A, B, and C rings, and the Cassini division, respectively. The values for fast rotators are still much smaller than those for solid ice with no porosity. Thus, fast rotators are likely to have surface regolith layers, but these may not be as fluffy as those for slow rotators, probably because the capability of holding regolith particles is limited for fast rotators due to the strong centrifugal force on surfaces of fast rotators. Other additional parameter fits, in which radii of fast rotators are varied, indicate that particles less than ∼ 1 cm should not occupy more than a half of the cross section for the A, B, and C rings.

40|$|In late 2004 and 2005 the Cassini {{composite}} {{infrared spectrometer}} (CIRS) obtained spatially resolved thermal infrared radial scans of Saturn's main rings (A, B and C, and Cassini Division) that show ring temperatures decreasing with increasing solar phase angle, (alpha), {{on both the}} lit and unlit faces of the ring plane. These temperature differences suggest that Saturn's main rings include a population of ring particles that spin slowly, with a spin period greater than 3. 6 h, given their low thermal <b>inertia.</b> The A <b>ring</b> shows the smallest temperature variation with (alpha), and this variation decreases with distance from the planet. This suggests {{an increasing number of}} smaller, and/or more rapidly rotating ring particles with more uniform temperatures, resulting perhaps from stirring by the density waves in the outer A ring and/or self-gravity wakes. The temperatures of the A and B rings are correlated with their optical depth, (tau), when viewed from the lit face, and anti-correlated when viewed from the unlit face. On the unlit face of the B ring, not only do the lowest temperatures correlate with the largest (tau), these temperatures are also the same at both low and high a, suggesting that little sunlight is penetrating these regions. The temperature differential from the lit to the unlit side of the rings is a strong, nearly linear, function of optical depth. This is consistent with the expectation that little sunlight penetrates to {{the dark side of the}} densest rings, but also suggests that little vertical mixing of ring particles is taking place in the A and B rings...|$|R
40|$|At {{the solar}} equinox in August 2009, the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) onboard Cassini showed the lowest Saturn's ring {{temperatures}} ever observed. Detailed radiative transfer models {{show that the}} observed equinox temperatures of Saturn's A ring are much higher than model predictions as long as only the flux from Saturn is taken into account. This indicates that the A ring was not completely cooled down at the equinox. We develop a simple seasonal model for ring temperatures and first assume that the internal density and the thermal <b>inertia</b> of a <b>ring</b> particle are uniform with depth. The particle size {{is estimated to be}} 1 - 2 m. The seasonal thermal inertia is found to be 30 - 50 Jm^- 2 K^- 1 s^- 1 / 2 in the middle A ring whereas it is ∼ 10 Jm^- 2 K^- 1 s^- 1 / 2 or as low as the diurnal thermal inertia in the inner and outermost regions of the A ring. An additional internal structure model, in which a particle has a high density core surrounded by a fluffy regolith mantle, shows that the core radius relative to the particle radius is about 0. 9 for the middle A ring and is much less for the inner and outer regions of the A ring. This means that the radial variation of the internal density of ring particles exists across the A ring. Some mechanisms may be confining dense particles in the middle A ring against viscous diffusion. Alternatively, the (middle) A ring might have recently formed (< 10 ^ 8 yr) by destruction of an icy satellite, so that dense particles have not yet diffused over the A ring and regolith mantles of particles have not grown thick. Our model results also indicate that the composition of the core is predominantly water ice, not rock. Comment: 52 pages, 19 figures, Icarus in pres...|$|R
40|$|Without an {{efficient}} transmission system {{the idea of}} {{an efficient}} vehicle is incomplete. During running of the vehicle especially in case of heavy vehicles the transmission system has to face different situations during which the system possibly can lose its efficiency. Definitely variations in efficiency of the transmission system demand from engine to vary its power to maintain the system efficiency to regulate speed of the vehicle. Gear shifting mechanism of the transmission system is one of the responsible agents for losing rotational speed of the system. The engine needs to increase its power to compensate such kind of losses by injecting the more fuel. Ultimately there will be more emissions on exhaust side. In this scenario the conducted research is concentrated on the gear shifting mechanism. To start with the well-defined aim a generic cone synchronizer mechanism modelled by a mechanical system with five degrees of freedom and comprising three rigid bodies is studied to understand the gear shifting process. To resolve complexity of the complete gear shifting processes detailed kinematic description of the phases and sub-phases gives an opportunity to capture the nature of bodies’ interaction and forces arise during their interaction. In the project a mathematical model to represent the whole gear shifting process is developed based on Constrained Lagrangian Formalism. The developed model went through validation test by using experimental data. Because the developed mathematical model is flexible to adopt other relevant models, the friction model is applied to the developed mathematical model and analyzed the differences in the results. The next step is to optimize the gear shifting process based on the input parameters. Using the developed model the analysis is performed in two steps; in first step the sensitivity analysis is considered to study the effect of variations of individual parameter on the system performance and in second step effects of a set of synchronizer mechanism's parameters which vary simultaneously are studied by using the optimization technique. Time duration of the gear shifting and speed difference at end of the main phase of synchronization process are chosen as objective functions of the system. Parameters estimated quickness and smoothness (comfort) of synchronization processes are cone angle, cone coefficient of friction, applied shift force, blocker angle, blocker coefficient of friction, cone radius, gear moment of <b>inertia</b> and <b>ring</b> moment of <b>inertia.</b> Eight cases of the synchronizer mechanism performance are studied under different scenarios of master/slave and different operating conditions. Further analysis on results obtained from the Pareto optimization clarifies the degree of influence of the input parameters. It was found that optimal performance of the system can be obtained by tuning few of the system parameters which have higher degree of influence instead of changing all the parameters together. For example in the case where the sleeve is considered as a master at nominal condition optimal performance of the synchronizer can be obtained by paying attention to applied shift force, cones angle, cones coefficient of friction, blocker angle and blocker coefficient of friction instead of taking all eight input parameters. At the end a graphical user interface is developed to obtain the synchronization performance diagram...|$|R
40|$|Characterizing {{the piston}} ring {{behavior}} is inherently {{associated with the}} oil consumption, friction, wear and blow-by in internal combustion engines. This behavior varies along the ring's circumference and determining these variations is of utmost importance for developing ring-packs achieving desired performances in terms of sealing and conformability. This study based on straight beam model was already developed but does not consider the lubrication sub-models, the tip gap effects and the characterization of the ring free shape based on any final closed shape. In this work, three numerical curved beam based models were developed to study {{the performance of the}} piston ring-pack. The conformability model was developed to characterize the behavior of the ring within the engine. In this model, the curved beam model is adopted with considering ring-bore and ring-groove interactions. This interactions include asperity and lubrication forces. Besides, gas forces are included to the model along with the <b>inertia</b> and initial <b>ring</b> tangential load. In this model we also allow for bore, groove upper and lower flanks thermal distortion. We also take into account the thermal expansion effect of the ring and the temperature gradient from inner diameter (ID) to outer diameter (OD) effects. The piston secondary motion and the variation of oil viscosity on the liner with its temperature in addition to the existence of fuel and the different hydrodynamic cases (Partially and fully flooded cases) are considered as well. This model revealed the ring position relative to the groove depending on the friction, inertia and gas pressures. It also characterizes the effect of non-uniform oil distribution on the liner and groove flanks. Finally, the ring gap position within a distorted bore also reveals the sealing performance of the ring. Using the curved beam model we also developed a module determining the twist calculation under fix ID or OD constraint. The static twist is an experimental characterization of the ring during which the user taps on the ring till there is a minimum clearance between the ring lowest point and the lower plate all over the ring's circumference but without any force contact. Our last model includes four sub-models that relate the ring free shape, its final shape when subjected to a constant radial pressure (this final shape is called ovality) and the force distribution in circular bore. Knowing one of these distribution, this model determines the other two. This tool is useful {{in the sense that the}} characterization of the ring is carried out by measuring its ovality which is more accurate than measuring its free shape or force distribution in circular bore. Thus, having a model that takes the ovality as an input is more convenient and useful based on the experiments carried out to characterize the ring. by Mohamed Aziz Bhouri. Thesis: S.

40|$|As {{fossil fuel}} {{reserves}} are rapidly being depleted, sustainable alternatives {{have to be}} found to fulfil the world's energy demand. Numerous concepts have been proposed to generate electricity by harnessing renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power. One of these concepts is the the so-called solar updraft tower (SUT). The SUT consists of three elements: a solar air collector, wind turbines and a chimney. The taller the chimney, the larger the stack effect and thus the more energy which can be generated by the turbines. The proposed concepts for this chimney schematise it as a reinforced concrete cylindrical shell, with the bottom half shaped like a hyperboloid and the top half as a flared cylinder, outfitted with ten stiffening rings evenly distributed over the height. Chimneys as tall as 1500 m have been proposed, and, previous research shows that these tall structures have very low eigenfrequencies which come {{very close to the}} peak of the wind power spectrum. This makes them extremely vulnerable to resonance induced by storm actions. Two types of resonance can be distinguished in these structures; along-wind resonance, and across-wind resonance. Along-wind resonance is caused by turbulence in along-wind gusts. The second type, across-wind resonance, is caused by the alternating shedding of vortices. This leads to pulsating excitation forces in the across-wind direction, and, if the frequency of the vortex shedding is the same as one of the eigenfrequencies of the chimney, resonance will occur. In this thesis, a finite element model is created based on a pre-existing design. This so-called base model is then analysed to determine which key problem areas could benefit from improvement. The analyses show that especially the first two eigenfrequencies are critical for along-wind resonance as well as across-wind resonance. These eigenfrequencies are seen as two individual problem areas as improvements to one eigenfrequency not necessarily guarantee improvements to the second eigenfrequency. Furthermore, tension on the windward side leads to cracks in the stiffening rings which negatively influence the eigenfrequencies and thus the dynamic response. The last area which could benefit from optimisation is the cost of the chimney; an optimal solution does not use more material than necessary. A design tool called SUMAT (Solar Updraft Modal Analysis Tool) is created which enables the user to analyse multiple chimney configurations at once, subsequently being able to compare their results. Various sensitivity analyses are carried out to determine the influence of geometric and material parameters on the four key problem areas of the chimney. A multi-objective optimisation process is followed to optimise each of the key problem areas, ie. objective functions, by hand. The first step in optimising the structure is to subdivide the parameters which were researched into four categories, depending on their usefulness. The second step consists of gradually introducing these parameter changes into the base model. The optimisation process revealed that the objective functions can be maximised as follows: increasing the moment of <b>inertia</b> of the <b>rings</b> by changing their aspect ratio ensures that the chimney is fully loaded in compression. An increase in the throat height further improves the reduction of tension on the windward side and the first eigenfrequency. A reduction in wall thickness {{at the top of the}} chimney improves the first eigenfrequency while also reducing material use. Lastly, it appears that the stiffening rings at the bottom serve little to no purpose. Removing them leads to a reduction in material use while some of the material gained can be used to increase the dimensions of the top rings, consequently improving the second eigenfrequency and reducing tension. More thorough analyses revealed that the optimisation process has indeed led to an overall improved structure when compared to the original base model. While along-wind resonance does not pose as great a threat as was initially assumed, due to the influence of aerodynamic admittance, the results do show that the improved eigenfrequencies led to a smaller increase in deflection as a result of dynamic wind action. Vortex shedding also no longer poses a threat as the improved second eigenfrequency resulted in critical wind speeds which are much larger than could ever occur at the chosen reference location. Future optimisations should therefore focus more heavily on the second eigenfrequency than on the first, assuming that the accompanying mode shapes stay the same.

40|$|With today’s striving towards {{reduction}} of fuel consumption it is moreimportant {{than ever to}} understand the function of different componentsin the internal combustion engine. There {{is a need to}} develop and usetools to investigate and predict the result of specific design changesmade on the components. In this work, the mechanics and the tribologyof the power cylinder unit and more specifically the operation of thepiston rings was investigated both numerically and experimentally. Theobjectives of the numerical part of this thesis were to develop simulationtools {{that can be used to}} quantify design changes to the TLOCR andthe cylinder liner. Such as the dimensions of the ring itself but also ringtension, running land profile, out of roundness of the cylinder liner andsurface texture of dimple type applied on the cylinder liner. Numericalsimulation models were developed and used to investigate operation of atwin land oil control ring (TLOCR). TLOCR are typically used in heavyduty diesel engines (HDDE). The TLOCR plays a very important role inthe engine since it is supposed to distribute the correct amount of oil onthe liner to lubricate the other rings. It is important that the TLOCRdoes not leave too much oil on the liner for the two top rings since itcould lead too high oil consumption. In a HDDE the piston assemblyis the largest contributor to frictional losses where the piston ring packaccounts for the major part of this. The oil control ring is the largestcontributor to frictional losses in the piston ring pack therefore makingit very interesting to study from a fuel consumption perspective. One ofthe models developed in this work accounts for the tribological interfaceof the TLOCR against the cylinder liner and piston ring groove as wellas the elastic deformation of the ring and the ring dynamics within thepiston ring groove. The actual ring cross section was modelled in orderto account for the full three dimensional elastic deformation of the ring. By solving all of these problems as a coupled system, the entire operation of the oil control ring can be understood in a better way than earlierand this opens up new optimisation possibilities for the TLOCR. Sincethe cylinder liner in an engine will always have some deviation fromperfectly round this is important. The full ring is modelled in order toaccount for out of round cylinder liners. The model can therefore beused to investigate the effect on oil distribution by reduced ring tensionwhich will affect the frictional losses of the system. It was found that thereduction in tangential force on the TLOCR with kept sealing capability,enabled by reduced out-of-roundness, could result in friction reductionof 40 % at mid-stroke. Because of the complexity, a multi-physics model of this type introducesdifficulties with convergence. Especially when implementinga mass conserving cavitation model and solving for the reversal of thepiston ring. Implementation and numerical verification of a mass conservingcavitation model was therefore performed. A method for dealingwith the convergence problem close to reversal was implemented and discussed. A model considering texture, of dimple type, on the cylinder linerwas also developed to find dimple dimensions optimal for reduced fuelconsumption. Since the dimples are modelled in a deterministic manner,only a periodic section of one land of the TLOCR was considered. Themodel takes mixed lubrication and <b>inertia</b> of the <b>ring</b> into considerationand a mass conserving cavitation algorithm were implemented. Theresults from the model predict friction {{reduction of}} approximately 40 %at mid-stroke speeds. The objective of the experimental part of this thesis is to developa novel test method for evaluation of piston ring friction at realisticspeeds. The test-rig was designed and constructed during the first halfof the project. The rig was designed so that standard HDDE productionpiston rings and cylinder liners could be easily mounted, and so thatpiston ring friction could be measured without influence from pistonfriction. Both cylinder liner and oil tank were equipped with heaters,where the oil supply resembles that in an actual engine. Repeatabilityof the results was found to be good. Influence on friction by differentcylinder liner surface roughness and coatings were investigated. Variouspiston ring designs, ring tension and coatings were also investigated. Itwas found that friction of the TLOCR could be reduced with close to 50 % with kept sealing capability by reduced ring tension and differentgeometry on the lands in contact with the cylinder liner. The numerical simulation model governing the full cross section of the TLOCR wasvalidated against measured piston ring friction data at a number ofdifferent speeds and excellent correlation was found...|$|R
