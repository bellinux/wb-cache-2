40|$|What is {{the role}} of {{audition}} in the process of speech production and speech perception? Specifically, how are speech production and speech perception integrated to facilitate forward flowing speech and communication? Theoretically, these processes are linked via feedforward and feedback control subsystems that simultaneously monitor on-going speech and <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback.</b> These control subsystems allow self-produced errors to be detected and internally and externally generated speech signals distinguished. Auditory event-related potentials were utilized to examine the link between speech production and perception in two experiments. In Experiment 1, auditory event-related potentials during passive listening conditions were evoked with nonspeech (i. e., tonal) and natural and synthetic speech stimuli in young normal-hearing adult male and female participants. Latency and amplitude measures of the P 1 -N 1 -P 2 components of the auditory long latency response were examined. In Experiment 2, auditory evoked N 1 -P 2 components were examined in the same participants during self-produced speech under four feedback conditions: nonaltered, frequency altered <b>feedback,</b> short <b>delay</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> (i. e., 50 ms), and long <b>delay</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> (i. e., 200 ms).

40|$|The {{question}} of whether our behavior is guided by our conscious intentions is gaining momentum {{within the field of}} cognitive neuroscience. It has been demonstrated that the subjective experience that conscious intentions are the driving force of our actions, is built partially on a post hoc reconstruction. Our hypothesis was that this reconstructive process is mediated by an action-monitoring system that compares the predicted and the actual sensory consequences of an action. We applied event-related potentials (ERP) to a variant of the Libet's task in which participants were asked to press a button and to report the time of decision – will judgment (W) – to press. We provided <b>delayed</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>feedbacks</b> after participants’ action to signify an action time later than the actual action. We found that <b>auditory</b> <b>feedbacks</b> evoked a negative component in the 250 – 300 time range, namely action-effect negativity (NAE), that is thought to reflect the activity of a system that detects violation from expectancies. We showed that the amplitude of the NAE was sensitive to the <b>delay</b> of the <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback,</b> with a larger amplitude for more delayed feedbacks. Furthermore, changes in the NAE were also associated with changes in the reported W. These results not only confirm that we infer the time we decided to act from events occurring after the response, but these results also indicate that the subjective experience of when an action is decided is influenced by the activity of an action-monitoring system that detects mismatches between predicted and actual sensory consequences of the actions...|$|R
40|$|The sounds {{produced}} when we touch textured surfaces frequently {{provide information}} regarding the structure of those surfaces. It has recently been demonstrated that {{the perception of the}} texture of the hands can be modified simply by manipulating the frequency content of such touch-related sounds. We investigated whether similar auditory manipulations change people's perception of the roughness of abrasive surfaces (experiment 1). Participants were required to make speeded, forced-choice discrimination responses regarding the roughness of a series of abrasive samples which they touched briefly. Analysis of discrimination errors verified that tactile roughness perception was modulated by the frequency content of the <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback.</b> Specifically, attenuating high frequencies led to a bias towards an increased perception of tactile smoothness. In experiment 2, we replicated the rubbing-hands manipulation of previous experimenters while participants rated either the perceived roughness or wetness of their hands. The wetness scale data replicated the results in the literature, while the roughness scale data replicated the result from experiment 1. A final experiment showed that <b>delaying</b> the <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> from the hand-rubbing reduced the magnitude of this parchment-skin illusion. These experiments demonstrate the dramatic effect that auditory frequency manipulations can have on the perceived tactile roughness and moistness of surfaces, and are consistent with the proposal that different auditory perceptual dimensions may have varying salience for different surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Performing {{music on}} the basis of reading a score {{requires}} reading ahead of what is being played in order to anticipate the necessary actions to produce the notes. Score reading thus not only involves the decoding of a visual score and the comparison to the <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback,</b> but also short-term storage of the musical information due to the <b>delay</b> of the <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> during reading ahead. This study investigates the mechanisms of encoding of musical information in short-term memory during such a complicated procedure. There were three parts in this study. First, professional musicians participated in an electroencephalographic (EEG) experiment to study the slow wave potentials during a time interval of short-term memory storage in a situation that requires cross-modal translation and short-term storage of visual material to be compared with <b>delayed</b> <b>auditory</b> material, as it is the case in music score reading. This delayed visual-to-auditory matching task was compared with delayed visual-visual and auditory-auditory matching tasks in terms of EEG topography and voltage amplitudes. Second, an additional behavioural experiment was performed to determine which type of distractor would be the most interfering with the score reading-like task. Third, the self-reported strategies of the participants were also analyzed. All three parts of this study point towards the same conclusion according to which during music score reading, the musician most likely first translates the visual score into an auditory cue, probably starting aroun...|$|R
40|$|Social {{interaction}} {{is fundamental to}} the development of various aspects of "we-ness". Previous research has focused on the role the content of interaction plays in establishing feelings of unity, belongingness and shared reality (a cluster of variables referred to as solidarity here). The present paper is less concerned with content, but focuses on the form of social interaction. We propose that the degree to which conversations flow smoothly or not is, of itself, a cue to solidarity. We test this hypothesis in samples of unacquainted and acquainted dyads who communicate via headsets. Conversational flow is disrupted by introducing a <b>delay</b> in the <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> (vs. no <b>delay).</b> Results of three studies show that smoothly coordinated conversations (compared with disrupted conversations and a control condition) increase feelings of belonging and perceptions of group entitativity, independently of conversation content. These effects are driven by the subjective experience of conversational flow. Our data suggest that this process occurs largely beyond individuals' control. We conclude that the form of social {{interaction is}} a powerful cue for inferring group solidarity. Implications for the impact of modern communication technology on developing a shared social identity are discussed...|$|R

However, {{the underlying mechanisms}} are still unknown. As reactivation during wakefulness renders memories sensitive to updating, it remains an intriguing question whether reactivated memories during sleep also become susceptible to incorporating further information after the cue. Here we show that the memory {{benefits of}} cueing Dutch vocabulary during sleep are in fact completely blocked when memory cues are directly followed by either correct or conflicting <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback,</b> or a pure tone. In addition, immediate (but not <b>delayed)</b> <b>auditory</b> stimulation abolishes the characteristic increases in oscillatory theta and spindle activity typically associated with successful reactivation during sleep as revealed by high-density electroencephalography.

40|$|Failure to use {{expressive}} {{language is a}} defining characteristic of juvenile autism (Ricks & Wing, 1975). Indeed, {{the fact that some}} 90 ~ of autistic children end up in institutions eems directly caused by two language-related problems [...] the child's inability to communicate with others, and the child's failure to learn to use "self-talk " as a means of establishing self-control over his thoughts and behaviors. By use of a device called the Phonic Ear, which allows the autistic child to selectively screen out auditory inputs the child does not wish to hear, we sought to increase spontaneous communication i two autistic hildren. The most popular types of therapy for autistic children [...] the use of behavior modification techniques (Lovaas, 1977), teaching the child to use sign language, and intonation therapy [...] have produced only limited com-munication in some children. These therapies probably fail because they put the child under increased environmental stress in order to "break through the child's resistances, " or because they seldom motivate the child to learn more appropriate behaviors. There is a growing body of evidence, however, that suggests that the most appropriate therapy for autistic children may involve a decrease in stress rather than an increase (Schechter, 1969). That stress can cause autisticlike symptoms has been documented by Goldfarb and Braunstein (1968). When these investigators ubjected schizophrenic children to a <b>delay</b> in <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> of. 16 seconds, the children displayed such autisticlike behaviors as screaming, covering the ears, and attacking the equipment.

40|$|Speech {{is arguably}} the most {{important}} form of human communication. Fluent speech production relies on <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> for the planning, execution, and monitoring of speech movements. <b>Auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> is particularly important during the acquisition of speech, however, {{it has been suggested that}} over time speakers rely less on <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> as they develop robust sensorimotor representations that allow speech motor commands to be executed in a feedforward manner. The studies reported in this thesis recorded speaker’s vocal and neural responses to altered <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> in order to explore the factors that dictate the relative importance of <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> for speech motor control. More specifically, studies 1 through 3 examined how the role of <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> changes throughout development, while studies 4 and 5 examined the relationship between vocal variability and <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> control, and lastly study 6 looked at how the predictability of <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> errors influences the role of <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> for speech motor control. Results of the first study demonstrated that toddlers use <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> to regulate their speech motor commands, supporting the long held notion that <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> is important during the acquisition of speech. While mapping out the developmental trajectory of vocal and event related potential responses to altered <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback,</b> the second study demonstrated that vocal variability, rather than age, best predicts responses to altered <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback.</b> Importantly, this suggests that the maturation of the speech motor control system is not strictly dependent on age. The third study in this thesis demonstrated that children and adults show similar rates of sensorimotor adaptation, suggesting that once speech is acquired, speakers are proficient at using sensory information to modify the planning of future speech motor commands. However, since adults produced larger compensatory responses, these results also suggested that adults are more proficient at comparing incoming <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> with the feedback predicted by their sensorimotor representations, as a result of possessing more precisely mapped sensorimotor representations. The results of studies four and five demonstrated that vocal variability can be used to predict the size of compensatory responses and sensorimotor adaptation to changes in one’s <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback,</b> respectively. Furthermore, these studies demonstrated that increased variability was related to increased <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> control of speech. Finally, the sixth study in this thesis demonstrated that experimentally induced predictability and variability can be used to induce increases in feedforward and <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> control, respectively. In conclusion, the results reported in this thesis demonstrate that age and vocal variability, both naturally occurring and experimentally induced, are important determinants of the role of <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> in speech motor control...|$|R

5000|$|The {{effect of}} <b>delayed</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> (DAF) in {{reducing}} stuttering {{has been noted}} since the 1950s. [...] A DAF user hears his or her voice in headphones, delayed {{a fraction of a}} second. Typical delays are in the 50 millisecond to 200 millisecond range. In stutterers, DAF may produce slow, prolonged but fluent speech. In the 1960s to 1980s, DAF was mainly used to train prolongation and fluency. As the stutterer masters fluent speech skills at a slow speaking rate, the delay is reduced in stages, gradually increasing speaking rate, until the person can speak fluently at a normal speaking rate. [...] It was not until the 1990s that research began to focus on DAF in isolation. Recent studies have moved from longer delays to shorter delays in the 50 millisecond to 75 millisecond range, and have found that speakers can maintain fast rates and achieve increased fluency at these delays. <b>Delayed</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>feedback</b> presented binaurally (i.e. in both ears) is more effective than that presented in monaurally, or in one ear only.|$|E

Its effects are slowing of speech which can result in increased fluency for clutterers and also syllable awareness.|$|E
