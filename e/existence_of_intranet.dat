This perspective helps to characterize the nature <b>of</b> <b>intranet</b> development and use as "islands of practice," and provides a background against which the rapid proliferation <b>of</b> organizational <b>intranets</b> in the 1990 's can be compared and contrasted with the explosion of personal computers and "islands of end-user computing" in the 1980 's.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{information flow}} and communication {{are the key}} tasks for a library of any type. Academic libraries operate in the information intensive environment, where timely and efficient communication between library staff impacts the quality of information services, ensures creative decisions and effective teamwork. However, to manage internal information flows an efficient information sharing infrastructure is crucial. For these purposes intranet, a technology which is widely applied for managing information sharing in business and also employed in libraries, can be used. Intranet {{offers a variety of}} tools that enable timely and convenient creation, sharing, communication and management of the internal information in academic libraries. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore the potential <b>of</b> <b>Intranet</b> as an infrastructure for managing internal communication and information sharing in the Lithuanian academic libraries. For this purpose a theoretical grounding <b>of</b> <b>intranet</b> application for information sharing and communication in academic libraries was developed. It allowed creating the framework for evaluation <b>of</b> <b>Intranet</b> potential in the Lithuanian academic libraries. Interviews with managers of the Lithuanian academic libraries were carried out to determine a strategic approach to Intranet application and development. The survey of the personnel of academic libraries, applying this tool, was performed to explore the nature of utilisation of this technology. The findings revealed that the library managers recognised the importance <b>of</b> <b>Intranet</b> functions. However, <b>Intranet</b> systems <b>of</b> the academic libraries were mostly oriented to one-way informing practices. Similarly, the staff of the surveyed academic libraries acknowledged the value <b>of</b> <b>Intranet</b> for their work but employed it mostly for efficient discovery and work with organisational documents. Finally, conclusions about the necessity <b>of</b> expansion <b>of</b> <b>Intranet</b> application in academic libraries and considering strategic, human and technical success factors while developing the system, were made. This paper is based on the findings of the Julija Zemcova’s bachelor thesis “The role <b>of</b> <b>Intranet</b> in managing internal information sharing in the Lithuanian academic libraries” (2009) ...|$|R

40|$|M. Com. (Computer Auditing) Intranets {{and related}} technology, {{can be used}} to solve many {{problems}} in the local computing environment. But the use <b>of</b> the <b>Intranet</b> and the related technology also raises several control concerns. Because of the increased use <b>of</b> <b>Intranets</b> within the business environment, the internal control related to the Intranet has become an issue {{that needs to be addressed}} by management and the auditor. Computerization in the accounting environment has made it virtually impossible to audit around the computer. It is therefore essential that the auditor, and more specifically the computer auditor, should assess the influence <b>of</b> the <b>Intranet</b> on the audit objectives. The objective of this short dissertation is to evaluate the influence <b>of</b> <b>Intranet</b> technology on the audit objectives (within the <b>Intranet's</b> different spheres <b>of</b> application) in terms of the risks posed for the auditor and management. It was also aimed at identifying the security risks in relationship with the audit objectives [...] ...|$|R

In physical layer and data link layer, based on network switch the intranet is divided into several parts separated from each other as required. In network layer, making use of the NAT gateway integrated in virtual server the intranet or its part is hidden to ensure its security, {{and at the same time}} the other part <b>of</b> the <b>intranet</b> can securely access to the part of hidden resources. Using reliable IP address management and distribution mechanism the IP addresses are kept from being stolen or abused. In application layer, using bi-directional proxy server each part <b>of</b> the <b>Intranet</b> is separated, but the hosts can access each other based on application and user authority. The security switches are used to connect each separate part <b>of</b> the <b>Intranet,</b> based on application as well as user authorization control to carry out network access control. The security architecture focuses on security guarantee <b>of</b> <b>intranet</b> inside the traditional network boundary, and provides foundation framework to Intranet security which can ensure the reliability, usability, confidentiality, integrity, and maneuverability <b>of</b> the <b>Intranet...</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{the number}} <b>of</b> <b>intranet</b> {{application}} increases, software developers face a new software paradigm {{and possibly a}} new set of quality requirement. The work discussed here attempts to identify practical software metrics for intranet applications. The six software quality characteristics and 32 quality sub-characteristics of the Extended ISO model are used as a basis to identify the key quality characteristics <b>of</b> <b>intranet</b> applications. From the results of a user survey, three key quality characteristics are identified; they are reliability, functionality, and efficiency. Five sub-characteristics (availability, accuracy, security, suitability and time behaviour) are found to be the key attributes <b>of</b> <b>intranet</b> applications. Finally, a set of three metrics is developed. In order to verify their validity and applicability to intranet projects, an experiment was performed by computing these metrics in five intranet applications. The metric values were then compared with the results from a user satisfaction survey. The metric values and the survey results were closely correlated; a larger score in software metrics leads to a higher user satisfaction score. It is very likely that these software metrics can effectively reflect the quality <b>of</b> an <b>intranet</b> application. # 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

With rising demand for end-user training, organizations are seeking new and innovative approaches for providing low-cost and effective training. Recently, intranet technology has received wide acclaim in the business press as a powerful and cost-effective method for providing anytime-anyplace training. Most of these claims, however, are anecdotal in nature. We have used a case study research method to evaluate intranet-based training in an organization. This study relies on extensive collection and analysis of both qualitative and quantitative data to study two research issues: (1) the role <b>of</b> <b>intranet</b> technology in all phases of the training process and (2) effectiveness of intranet-based training. This research expands our understanding of a new and innovative strategy for training end-users. The results of this study will provide a foundation for conducting further research on the role and effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>intranets</b> in providing end-user training. It will also provide guidelines to IS and training managers in evaluating the appropriateness <b>of</b> <b>intranet</b> technology for training end-users. 1...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a case study of}} the use made of a UK National Health Service {{hospital}} intranet by hospital staff. It reports the results of a questionnaire and follow-up interviews with staff concerning intranet use. The results showed that relatively little use was made <b>of</b> the <b>intranet</b> in terms <b>of</b> overall frequency, though some intranet sites and local services were used relatively heavily. However, interview respondents did view the intranet as a positive asset. The interviews showed the reasons for the low usage to be partly geographical (access to PCs in work locations), partly network availability, but mainly due to uptake by staff. Recommendations were made regarding familiarisation with and advertising <b>of</b> <b>intranet</b> content, inclusion <b>of</b> <b>intranet</b> use in existing IT training, and usage encouragements.
