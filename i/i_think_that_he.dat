500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E

2500|$|If any {{one will}} piously and soberly {{consider}} the sermon which our Lord Jesus Christ {{spoke on the}} mount, as we {{read it in the}} Gospel according to Matthew, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will find in it, so far as regards the highest morals, a perfect standard of the Christian life ...|$|E

[...] "We had to guess at the train; but we sent the brougham in for the twelve o'clock, and Johnson waited. We've given him the south room, sir, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> quite comfortable." ...|$|R
2500|$|November 9 [...] Following John Kerry's {{loss in the}} 2004 election, Cameron Kerry, John Kerry's {{brother and}} {{political}} confidante states in regards to another presidential run [...] "That's conceivable... I don't know why that [...] should necessarily be it. I think it's too early to assess. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{is going to continue}} to fight on for the values, ideals, and issues this campaign is about." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rebel {{director}} Nicholas Ray is {{on record}} as saying that Dean was gay, while author John Howlett believes that Dean was [...] "certainly bisexual". George Perry's biography attributes these reported aspects of Dean's sexuality to [...] "experimentation". Martin Landau stated, [...] "A lot of gay guys make him out to be gay. Not true." [...] Mark Rydell stated, [...] "I don't think he was essentially homosexual. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had very big appetites, and I think he exercised them." ...|$|E
2500|$|He had {{developed}} a friendship with Keith Kirk, a working-class teenage friend of Francis Skinner, the mathematics undergraduate {{he had had a}} relationship with until Skinner's death in 1941 from polio. Skinner had given up academia, thanks at least in part to Wittgenstein's influence, and had been working as a mechanic in 1939, with Kirk as his apprentice. Kirk and Wittgenstein struck up a friendship, with Wittgenstein giving him lessons in physics to help him pass a City and Guilds exam. During his period of loneliness at Guy's he wrote in his diary: [...] "For ten days I've heard nothing more from K, even though I pressed him a week ago for news. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has perhaps broken with me. A tragic thought!" [...] Kirk had in fact got married, and they never saw one another again.|$|E

2500|$|The fight ended {{after the}} fourth round when Penn's cornerman, Jason Parillo, {{requested}} that the referee stop the fight. Penn failed to attend the post-fight press conference due to hospitalization for injuries. Penn later admitted {{that he could not}} recall anything that happened during the 3rd and 4th rounds because [...] "I was probably borderline knocked out or something." [...] During the fight, Penn complained that St-Pierre was too slippery to hold, which led to suspicion about petroleum jelly being illegally applied to St-Pierre's back. The matter was formally investigated by the UFC and Nevada State Athletic Commission upon the request of the Penn camp. Dana White said it was unfortunate GSP's dominant win was overshadowed by the cornerman controversy. [...] "Do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> got greased? Yeah, I do," [...] White told The Canadian Press prior to the UFC 95 weigh-in Friday at the Dominion Theatre. [...] "Absolutely, 100 per cent, I think that that guy was rubbing grease on him. Do I think Georges was trying to cheat? Absolutely not at all, but that cornerman was rubbing grease on him; you cannot do that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite his celebrated flaws, history records Fox as {{an amiable}} figure. The Tory wit George Selwyn wrote that, [...] "I have passed two evenings with him, and never was anybody so agreeable, {{and the more}} so from his having no pretensions to it". Selwyn also said that [...] "Charles, I am persuaded, would have no {{consideration}} on earth but for what was useful to his own ends. You have heard me say, that I thought he had no malice or rancour; I think so still and am sure of it. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has no feeling neither, for anyone but himself; and if I could trace in any one action of his life anything that had not for its object his own gratification, I should with pleasure receive the intelligence because then I had much rather (if it were possible) think well of him than not". Sir Philip Francis said of Fox: [...] "The essential defect in his character {{and the cause of}} all his failures, strange as it may seem, was that he had no heart". Edward Gibbon remarked that [...] "Perhaps no human being was ever more perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence, vanity, or falsehood." [...] Central to understanding Fox's life was his view that [...] "friendship was the only real happiness in the world." [...] For Fox, politics was the extension of his activities at Newmarket and Brooks's to Westminster. [...] "Fox had little or no interest in the exercise of power." [...] The details of policy – particularly of economics – bored him, in contrast with the intensity of Burke’s legal pursuit of Warren Hastings, and of Pitt’s prosecution of the war against France. Moreover, the Foxites were [...] "the witty and wicked" [...] satellites of their leader, as much friends as political allies.|$|E
2500|$|Eckford {{extended}} extensive {{credit to}} the United States Government during the war, going bankrupt in the process because of difficulty the government had in paying him, although he never doubted that it eventually would. His efforts, {{along with those of}} Adam and Noah Brown, were key to American success on Lake Ontario during the War of 1812. Chauncey wrote in praise of Eckford to Secretary of the Navy William Jones on 8 October 1813, saying, [...] "...yet as Mr. Eckford has built 4 vessels at this place, and has become acquainted with the resources and people of this part of the country, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could have built sooner and perhaps cheaper than perhaps any other man, and as to his talents as a ship carpenter, I am bold {{to say that there is}} not his equal in the United States, or perhaps the world. His exertions are unexampled...," [...] and in a letter of 15 January 1814, Jones replied, [...] "The talents and zeal of Mr. Eckford the builder, is a source of great satisfaction and confidence, which assures me that though the enemy has made great progress in the building of his two largest vessels, he will be over taken and surpassed in this branch of service by the superior energy and judgment of Mr. Eckford." [...] In the words of maritime historian Howard I. Chapelle, [...] "It was Eckford's extraordinary ability to design, lay down, and build ships, ranging in size from a very small schooner to the largest frigates, working in a wilderness and in severe winter weather with sick or dissatisfied labor, and to do all this in extremely short periods of time, that maintained American superiority on Lake Ontario." [...] Chapelle continues, [...] "From a naval shipbuilding point of view, the outstanding men of the War of 1812 were Eckford and the Browns, Adam and Noah. Through the efforts of these three, the [...] Navy held control of the lakes and prevented the British from invading the North and Northwest ... No officer or constructor of the Navy accomplished more. There were no competitors to the Browns and Eckford among the navy yards, or in the contract shipyards along the coasts, [...] on the lakes... building was made infinitely more difficult than on the coast because of climate and geographical conditions, to say nothing of scarcities of labor and some materials." [...] One advantage Eckford and the Browns may have had was a lack of attention by US government officials to their activities; Federal officials focused their efforts on the coasts, where they greatly interfered with shipbuilding decisions and progress during the war.|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank you, Uncle Silas," [...] {{said the}} girl, with dignity, [...] "but <b>I</b> {{scarcely}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would care to know me. He feels so strongly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Object to you!" [...] she repeated. [...] "On the contrary, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> rather approves of you. You {{saved his}} life, or {{something}} {{very much like}} it. He should be very grateful! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do, and I'll {{tell you}} why," [...] Helen answered. [...] "I don't think Mr. Lessingham {{is at all}} the type of man to which you are accustomed. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is in deadly earnest about you. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was in deadly earnest from the first.

6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that.</b> <b>He</b> was riled up, {{and wanted}} to say {{something}} extra mean. And it was mean--as mean as dirt!" [...] added Andy.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{mean the}} Bishop; though <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{has shown a}} great want of what I may call liberality towards a clergyman in his diocese." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{shall be}} here, sir," [...] he said, [...] "and I thank you heartily for {{engaging}} him; and <b>I</b> do <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> means {{this time to}} behave himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God knows. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> heard <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{married an}} old woman and settled down somewhere. I know he never came up again. Now, I call that a confounded shame. I suppose I'm safe down in Mayo, but there's no knowing what may happen in these days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I only mean," [...] said Lady Peveril, [...] "that as the person--he to whom Lord Derby's story related--was {{the brother}} of his late lady, <b>he</b> threatened--but <b>I</b> cannot <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was serious." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is {{all very}} shocking," [...] the lady said. [...] "What will poor Mr. Bastow do? <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would not like to}} remain as clergyman here, where {{everyone}} knows about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I do. That is, I {{like him}} to scold me if he is angry. If he were angry, and did not scold a little, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was really vexed with me." ...|$|R
