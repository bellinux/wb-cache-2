5|$|Adults who <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> that zero is even can {{nevertheless}} be {{unfamiliar with}} {{thinking of it}} as even, enough so to measurably slow them down in a reaction time experiment. Stanislas Dehaene, {{a pioneer in the}} field of numerical cognition, led a series of such experiments in the early 1990s. A numeral or a number word is flashed to the subject on a monitor, and a computer records the time it takes the subject to push one of two buttons to identify the number as odd or even. The results showed that 0 was slower to process than other even numbers. Some variations of the experiment found delays as long as 60 milliseconds or about 10% of the average reaction time—a small difference but a significant one.|$|E
25|$|While most Pentecostals and Charismatics {{believe the}} Bible {{to be the}} {{ultimate}} authority and would not say that any new revelation can ever contradict the Bible, they <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> that God continues to speak to people today on extra-biblical topics as well as to interpret and apply the text of the Bible.|$|E

50|$|In 2008, {{a survey}} {{conducted}} by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, found that 31% of white Evangelical Protestants <b>did</b> not <b>believe</b> that there is solid evidence showing that the Earth is warming. 34% of white Evangelical Protestants <b>did</b> <b>believe</b> that there was evidence, but 17% <b>did</b> not <b>believe</b> that warming was due to human impacts. 47% of the total U.S. population <b>does</b> <b>believe</b> that the Earth is warming because of human influences and 58% of unaffiliated Americans believe that global warming due to human impacts is real.|$|R

25|$|Some Shia, {{such as the}} Zaidi and Nizari Ismaili, do {{not believe}} in the idea of the Occultation. The groups which <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> in it differ as to which lineage of the Imamate is valid, and {{therefore}} which individual has gone into occultation. They believe there are many signs that will indicate the time of his return.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{specific}} {{rule in the}} New Testament prohibiting tattoos and most Christian denominations believe the laws in Leviticus are outdated as well as believing the commandment only applied to the Israelites, not to the gentiles. While most Christian groups tolerate tattoos, some Evangelical and fundamentalist Protestant denominations <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> the commandment does apply today for Christians and believe it is a sin to get one.|$|E
25|$|Michelacci and Schivardi {{a pair of}} {{researchers}} who believe that identifying and comparing the relationships between an entrepreneur's earnings and education level would determine the rate and level of success. Their study focused on two education levels, college degree and post-graduate degree. While Michelacci and Schivardi do not specifically determine characteristics or traits for successful entrepreneurs, they <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> {{that there is a}} direct relationship between education and success, noting that having a college degree does contribute to advancement in the workforce.|$|E

2500|$|He asked, How we <b>did</b> <b>believe</b> the Resurrection? We answered, We <b>did</b> <b>believe</b> {{that the}} just and the unjust should arise, {{according}} to the Scriptures [...] He asked, if we believed in Purgatory? We said, No; but a Heaven and a Hell [...] He asked, if we believed [...] their holy Sacrament? We said, We never read (the Word) Sacrament in Scripture...|$|R
25|$|In a {{subsequent}} article for The New York Review of Books, Soros emphasized thatI do not {{subscribe to the}} myths propagated by enemies of Israel and I am not blaming Jews for anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should {{be held responsible for}} anti-Semitism. At the same time, I <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views.|$|E
25|$|Strmiska {{argues that}} these two poles could be termed reconstructionism and eclecticism, respectively. Reconstructionists do not {{altogether}} reject innovation in their interpretation and adaptation of the source material, however they <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> that the source material conveys greater authenticity and thus should be emphasized. They often follow scholarly debates {{about the nature of}} such pre-Christian religions, and some reconstructionists are themselves scholars. Eclectic Pagans, conversely, seek general inspiration from the pre-Christian past, and do not attempt to recreate past rites or traditions with specific attention to detail.|$|E
25|$|Of {{those who}} <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> that the Internet {{promotes}} social capital, {{a longitudinal study}} in Pittsburgh found that Internet usage increased rates of individual participation in community activities as well as levels of trust. Additionally, these increased levels of involvement were greater for participants who had previously been the least involved. Of those who use the Internet in the United States, {{studies have found that}} these individuals tend to be members of community social networks, participate in community activities, and exhibit higher levels of political participation.|$|E

25|$|According {{to a study}} {{conducted}} by Pew Research Center in 2012, the number of Americans who do not identify with any religion has increased from 15% in 2007 to 20% in 2012, and this number continues to grow. One fifth of the US public and a third of adults under the age of 30 are reportedly unaffiliated with any religion, however they identify as being spiritual in some way. Of these religiously unaffiliated Americans, 37% classify themselves as spiritual but not religious, while 68% say they <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> in God, and 58% feel a deep connection to the earth.|$|E
25|$|The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community {{believes}} that divine decree controls the eventual outcome of all actions in this universe. Within {{the boundaries of}} divine decree, man is given free will to choose the course. Ahmadi Muslims believe {{that they will be}} judged {{on the basis of their}} intentions and deeds on the Day of Judgment. Ahmadis believe that science is the study of the acts of God and religion is the study of the word of God and the two cannot possibly contradict each other. They believe that Adam, the prophet, was simply the first Prophet and not the first human on earth, as understood by them being in the Quran. Ahmadi Muslims <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> in the theory of biological evolution, albeit guided by God.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{publications}} {{have made}} it clear since the 1980s that the majority of researchers <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> animals suffer and feel pain, though it continues to be argued that their suffering may be reduced by an inability to experience the same dread of anticipation as humans, or to remember the suffering as vividly. The problem of animal suffering, and animal consciousness in general, arose primarily because it was argued that animals have no language. Singer writes that, if language were needed to communicate pain, it would often be impossible to know when humans are in pain, though we can observe pain behavior and make a calculated guess based on it. He argues that {{there is no reason to}} suppose that the pain behavior of nonhumans would have a different meaning from the pain behavior of humans.|$|E

25|$|Ampelographers <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> that Carignan {{is likely}} {{a very old}} variety due to its {{widespread}} plantings {{and the proliferation of}} numerous different synonyms that give testament to the grape's long history in different wine regions. The grape likely originated in the Aragon region of northwest Spain where it possibly named after the town of Cariñena in the province of Zaragoza. However, in Zaragoza and other parts of Catalonia, the grape is sometimes called Samsó which is also used as a synonym for the French wine grape Cinsault adding to confusion to Carignan's history in the region. Another Spanish synonym, Mazuelo which is used in the Rioja wine region, is believed by ampelographers and wine historians to come from the commune of Mazuela in the province of Burgos in the Castile and León region of northwest Spain.|$|E
25|$|Those Protestants who <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> in the {{importance}} of a future rebuilt temple (viz., some dispensationalists) hold that {{the importance}} of the sacrificial system shifts to a Memorial of the Cross, given the text of Ezekiel Chapters 39 and following (in addition to Millennial references to the Temple in other Old Testament passages); since Ezekiel explains at length the construction and nature of the Millennial temple, in which Jews will once again hold the priesthood; some others hold that perhaps it was not completely eliminated with Jesus' sacrifice for sin, but is a ceremonial object lesson for confession and forgiveness (somewhat like water baptism and Communion are today); and that such animal sacrifices would still be appropriate for ritual cleansing and for acts of celebration and thanksgiving toward God. Some dispensationalists believe this will be the case with the Second Coming when Jesus reigns over earth from the city of New Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|Some Sunni {{scholars}} <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> in Raj’a, {{believing in}} the return of number of people such as Seven Sleepers synchronous {{with the appearance of}} the Mahdi. Jalaluddin Al-Sayuti wrote about the raj`a but in a different way from the Shiites. According to his book The Possibility of Seeing the Prophet and the Angels (Arabic: تنوير الحلك في إمكان رؤية النبي والملك,) Suyuti claims to have seen the Prophet Muhammad over 70 times while he was awake. According to him, in contrast to Shiite belief, the return of the Prophet Muhammad is not limited to a specific time in the future. Al-Sayuti did not mention if any other religious figures will return after death before the resurrection. According to Abu 'Abdullah Al-Qurtubi, raj`a is understood as the lack of physical presence of a prophet, who marks his apparent death by absence in the physical world but will reappear, from time to time, to those who are pure in heart. The Maliki scholar Ibn al-Arabi, known for his exegesis of the Sunan al-Tirmidhi, stated that seeing and hearing the prophets while awake is possible for the pure believer.|$|E

500|$|She {{takes several}} daily insulin injections, and her {{diabetes}} {{is considered to}} be well controlled. Sotomayor does not belong to a Catholic parish or attend Mass, but does attend church for important occasions. She has said, [...] "I am a very spiritual person [...] maybe not traditionally religious in terms of Sunday Mass every week, that sort of thing. The trappings are not important to me, but, yes, I <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> in God. And, yes, I <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> in the commandments." ...|$|E

500|$|Gay {{attended}} the St. John Missionary Baptist Church as a child, {{and when he}} returns home he still attends the church services. His beliefs matter to him {{both on and off}} the track: [...] "I'm a religious man, so I really believe in my God-given ability, that I can do the unexpected. I really <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> I can break a record, or come close to it, or win a medal." [...] He is frequently described as a modest and respectful athlete.|$|E
