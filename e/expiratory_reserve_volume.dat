40|$|Classifying 40 cardiac {{patients}} {{into various}} groups, and besides judging subjective and objective findings, the respiratory function tests were performed {{in each group}} of slight, moderate and severe degree, Gaensler 2 ̆ 7 s 1 st and milder cases within the 2 nd group corresponded to the slight group, the 2 nd and milder cases within the 3 rd group to the moderate group, the 3 rd and the 4 th group to the severe group respectively. With due regard to the all clinical states, the mode of response caused by the administration of drugs were classified into the effective, unchanged and exacerbated. 7 cases with pulmonary emphysema, 5 with bronchial asthma, and one with hyperthyrosis were compared and contrasted with cardiac patients. In order to study the influence of postural change upon respiratory function, lung- and ventilation volumes were measured in lying and standing positions, and as circumstances require, also in sitting, with special reference to the relationship to circulatory dynamical factors. 1. The tidal volume of cardiac patients was in general found {{less than that of}} normal health, provided that in bronchospasm, cor pulmonale, pulmonary emphysema and bronchial asthma the tidal volumes were commonly determined larger than those in normal health. The patients with rales in any of groups tended to have the small tidal volume. 2. The respiratory minute volume in bronchial asthma was a little on the average, whereas in cardiac disorders it was rather larger than that in normal health. Expressly, in lying the patients with hyperthyrosis, auricular fibrillation and bronchospasm, and in standing, the patients with pulmonary emphysema, cor pulmonale and cardiogenic bronchospasm tended to show the higher R. M. V. than those of normal subjects. 3. The inspiratory capacities in pulmonary emphysema, cor pulmonale and bronchial asthma were used to be found within normal range both in lying and standing, while those capacities in cardiac disorders were often observed less than that in normal health. Especially, the cases with rales showed the low value. 4. The <b>expiratory</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>volumes</b> in pulmo-cardiac diseases were estimated subnormally, whereas those in cor pulmonale, pulmonary emphysema and bronchial asthma were relatively higher than those in cardiac diseases on the average. The cases with rales showed occasionally the marked low value. 5. The vital capacity in any group of cardiac diseases was measured less than that in normal health. V.

The maximal breathing capacity in any group of diseases observed here, especially in cardiogenic bronchospasm or cor pulmonale was determined less than that in normal health, whereas the left ventricular failure showed not so marked decrease on the average. M. B. C. of the cases with rales were commonly estimated low. 7. While the air velocity index in hyperthyrosis or auricular fibrillation was found longer than 1. 0, in the other groups of diseases, particularly in cardiogenic bronchospasm, pulmonary emphysema and bronchial asthma A.

50|$|Specific {{changes in}} lung volumes also occur during pregnancy. Functional {{residual}} capacity drops 18-20%, typically falling from 1.7 to 1.35 litres, {{due to the}} compression of the diaphragm by the uterus. The compression also causes a decreased total lung capacity (TLC) by 5% and decreased <b>expiratory</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>volume</b> by 20%. Tidal volume increases by 30-40%, from 0.5 to 0.7 litres, and minute ventilation by 30-40% giving an increase in pulmonary ventilation. This is necessary to meet the increased oxygen requirement of the body, which reaches 50 mL/min, 20 mL of which goes to reproductive tissues. Overall, the net change in maximum breathing capacity is zero.|$|E

AIM: Determine what moment of application of positive pressure brings better benefits on lung function, incidence of atelectasis and diaphragmatic excursion, in the preoperative, intraoperative or immediate postoperative period. METHOD: Randomized, controlled, blinded study, conducted in a hospital and included subjects with BMI between 40 and 55 kg/m 2, 25 and 55 years, underwent bariatric surgery by laparotomy. They were underwent preoperative and postoperative evaluations. They were allocated into four different groups: 1) Gpre: treated with positive pressure in the BiPAP mode (Bi-Level Positive Airway Pressure) before surgery for one hour; 2) Gpos: BIPAP after surgery for one hour; 3) Gintra: PEEP (Positive End Expiratory Pressure) at 10 cmH 2 O during the surgery; 4) Gcontrol: only conventional respiratory physiotherapy. The evaluation consisted of anthropometric data, pulmonary function tests and chest radiography. RESULTS: Were allocated 40 patients, 10 in each group. There were significant differences for the <b>expiratory</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>volume</b> and percentage of the predicted <b>expiratory</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>volume,</b> in which the groups that received treatment showed a smaller loss in <b>expiratory</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>volume</b> from the preoperative to postoperative stages.

40|$|The morbidly obese {{are known}} to have {{impaired}} respiratory function. A prospective study of the changes in lung volumes, carbon monoxide transfer, and arterial blood gas tensions was undertaken in 29 morbidly obese patients before and after surgery to induce weight loss. Before surgery the predominant abnormality in respiratory function was a reduction in lung volumes. These increased towards normal predicted values after weight loss, with significant increases in functional residual capacity, residual volume, total lung capacity, and <b>expiratory</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>volume.</b> The increases ranged from 14 % for total lung capacity to 54 % for <b>expiratory</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>volume.</b> After weight loss had been induced the smokers showed mild hyperinflation and air trapping. Resting arterial blood gas tensions improved, with a rise in arterial oxygen tension from 10. 63 to 13. 02 kPa and a fall in arterial carbon dioxide tension from 5. 20 to 4. 64 kPa. There was no correlation between weight loss and the changes in blood gas tensions or lung volumes. Loss of weight in the morbidly obese is thus associated with improved lung function. The effects of smoking on lung function could be detected after weight loss, but were masked before treatment by the opposing effects of obesity on residual volume and functional residual capacity...|$|E

The herein presented study {{aimed at the}} comparison of <b>volume</b> <b>reserve</b> capacity and development of intra-abdominal hypertension after forced primary abdominal closure and different TAC techniques in a porcine model. METHODS: Eight anesthesized and mechanically ventilated domestic pigs underwent a standardized midline laparotomy. A bag was placed into the abdominal cavity. Before abdominal closure, the bag was prefilled with 3, 000 mL water to simulate increased intra-abdominal volume. The intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) was then increased in 2 mm Hg steps up to 30 mm Hg by adding <b>volume</b> (<b>volume</b> <b>reserve</b> capacity) to the intra-abdominal bag. <b>Volume</b> <b>reserve</b> capacity with the corresponding IAP were analyzed and compared for primary abdominal closure, bag silo closure, a zipper system, and vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) with different negative pressures (- 50, - 100, and - 150 mm Hg). Hemodynamic and pulmonary parameters were monitored throughout the experiment. RESULTS: <b>Volume</b> <b>reserve</b> capacity was the highest for bag silo closure followed by the zipper system and VAC with primary abdominal closure providing the least <b>volume</b> <b>reserve</b> capacity in the whole IAP range. Of interest, VAC - 50 mm Hg resulted in a lower <b>volume</b> <b>reserve</b> capacity when compared with VAC - 100 and - 150 mm Hg. Pulmonary and hemodynamic parameters demonstrated {{no significant differences between}} primary abdominal closure and the evaluated TAC techniques at all IAP levels. CONCLUSIONS: The present experimental in vivo study indicates that bag silo closure and zipper systems may be favorable TAC techniques after decompressive laparotomy. In contrast, the VAC techniques resulted in lower <b>volume</b> <b>reserve</b> capacity and therefore may bear an increased risk for recurrent intra-abdominal hypertension in the initial phase after decompressive laparotomy...|$|R
