40|$|With the {{introduction}} of SFAS 95 in 1987, the cash flow statement became {{an integral part of}} financial reporting. With this a need arose for the development of ratios for the effective evaluation of the cash flow statement. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} determine the usefulness of the cash flow statement by means of cash <b>flow</b> <b>ratios.</b> Beaver (1966) was the first researcher to stress the importance of cash flow information for predicting financial failure and, therefore, the study investigated the available cash <b>flow</b> <b>ratios</b> of various authors. Eight cash <b>flow</b> <b>ratios</b> were suggested for inclusion in a financial analysis. Failed entities were selected and evaluated by means the selected cash <b>flow</b> <b>ratios</b> for five years prior to their failure. Non-failed entities were selected and included in the evaluation. The results of the ratios were used to calculate mean values for each ratio and year prior to failure. The ratios of the failed entities were compared with those of the non-failed entities. A comparison of the ratios revealed that the cash <b>flow</b> <b>ratios</b> have predictive value. The cash flow to total debt and ratio was identified as the ratio with the greatest potential to predict financial failure. The mean value of the ratio was weaker than the mean of the non-failed entities in four out of five years. The mean values of the cash <b>flow</b> <b>ratios</b> of the failed entities performed weaker overall than the non-failed entities. Failed entities not only have lower cash flows than non-failed entities but they also have smaller reserves of liquid assets. Therefore, they have less capacity to meet obligations and they tend to incur more debt. The ratios of the failed entities were also unstable. The study concluded that cash <b>flow</b> <b>ratios</b> calculated from the cash flow statement enhanced the usefulness of financial statements. A need, however, remains for consensus on a comprehensive set of cash <b>flow</b> <b>ratios</b> for financial analysis.

40|$|Purpose: With the {{introduction}} of the cash flow statement it became an integral part of financial reporting. A need arose to develop ratios for the effective evaluation of cash flow information. This article investigates cash <b>flow</b> <b>ratios</b> suggested by various researchers and suggests a list of ratios with the potential to predict financial failure. Design: The cash <b>flow</b> <b>ratios</b> suggested by researchers, from as early as 1966, are investigated and eight cash <b>flow</b> <b>ratios</b> selected for inclusion in an analysis to predict financial failure. Ten failed entities are selected for a cash flow evaluation by means of the selected ratios for five years prior to failure. For a comparison, non-failed entities in similar sectors are selected and also evaluated by means of the cash <b>flow</b> <b>ratios.</b> The mean values of each ratio, for each year prior to failure, were then calculated and the means of the failed entities were compared to the non-failed entities. Findings: The comparison revealed that cash <b>flow</b> <b>ratios</b> have predictive value with the cash flow to total debt identified as the best indicator of failure. It was also determined that, although failed entities have lower cash flows than non-failed entities, they also had smaller reserves of liquid assets. Furthermore, they have less capacity to meet debt obligations and they tend to incur more debt. The ratios of the failed entities were unstable and fluctuated from one year to the next. Finally, bankruptcy could be predicted three years prior to financial failure. Implications: Income statement and balance sheet ratios are not enough to measure liquidity.

We used an animal model of a univentricular heart to characterize the physiologic effects {{of a number of}} commonly used ventilatory treatments, including altering inspired oxygen tension, adding positive end-expiratory pressure, and adding supplemental carbon dioxide to the ventilator circuit. Results: Lowering inspired oxygen tension decreased the ratio of pulmonary to systemic flow. This ratio was 1. 29 ± 0. 08 at an inspired oxygen tension of 100 %, 0. 61 ± 0. 09 at an inspired oxygen tension of 21 %, and 0. 42 ± 0. 09 at an inspired oxygen tension of 15 % (p < 0. 05 compared with an inspired oxygen tension of 100 % and a positive end-expiratory pressure of 0 cm H 2 O). High-concentration supplemental carbon dioxide (carbon dioxide tension of 80 to 90 mm Hg) added to the ventilator circuit decreased inspired oxygen tension from 1. 29 ± 0. 11 to 0. 42 ± 0. 12 (p < 0. 05 compared with baseline). A mixture of 95 % oxygen and 5 % carbon dioxide (carbon dioxide tension of 50 to 60 mm Hg) did not decrease the pulmonary/systemic <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> significantly. All three types of interventions influenced systemic oxygen delivery, which was a function of the pulmonary/systemic <b>flow</b> <b>ratio.</b> As the pulmonary/systemic <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> decreased from initially high levels (greater than 1), oxygen delivery first increased and reached an optimum at a <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> slightly less than 1. As the pulmonary/systemic <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> decreased further, below 0. 7, oxygen delivery decreased. The ability of systemic arterial and venous oxygen saturations to predict the pulmonary/systemic <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> was examined. Venous oxygen saturation correlated well with both pulmonary/systemic <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> and systemic oxygen delivery, whereas arterial oxygen saturation did not accurately predict either pulmonary/systemic <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> or oxygen delivery. Conclusion: This model demonstrated the value of estimating the pulmonary/systemic <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> before initiating therapy.

When the initial pulmonary/systemic <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> was below 0. 7, interventions that decreased the ratio decreased oxygen delivery and were detrimental.

Methods. Twenty normal volunteers were studied with dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and intravenous nitrogen- 13 ammonia.

Myocardial blood flow at rest averaged 1. 1 ± 0. 2 ml/min per g and increased significantly to 4. 4 ± 0. 9 ml/min per g during adenosine and 43 ± 1. 3 ml/min per g after dipyridamole administration.

Methods: Twenty-four infants who underwent first-stage palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome or a variant were studied. Superior vena cava blood samples were drawn to estimate the mixed venous saturation and permit calculation of the pulmonary/systemic blood <b>flow</b> <b>ratio.</b> Fifty-four samples were evaluated within the first 24 hours after surgery. Simultaneous blood draw and Doppler echocardiography were performed with interrogation in the distal aspect of the arch reconstruction. The ratio of the Doppler velocity-time integral of retrograde flow to the velocity-time integral of forward flow was calculated and compared with the pulmonary/systemic blood <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> Results: The median mixed venous saturation for the 54 samples was low (38. 5 %; range, 18 %- 64 %). The median calculated pulmonary/systemic blood <b>flow</b> <b>ratio</b> was 1. 4 : 1 (range, 0. 3 : 1 to 4. 2 : 1). Pulse pressure, mixed venous saturation, and arterial PO 2 were not statistically significant predictors of the measured pulmonary/systemic blood <b>flow</b> <b>ratio.</b> Although both aortic oxygen saturation (R 2 = 0. 84, P <. 01) and Doppler flow reversal ratio (R 2 = 0. 94, P <. 001) were significantly associated with the measured pulmonary/systemic blood <b>flow</b> <b>ratio,</b> the model coefficient of determination was greatest for Doppler flow reversal ratio.

The amount of Mg incorporation/activation was varied by using several Mg/Ga <b>flow</b> <b>ratios</b> and post-growth annealing treatment. For lower Mg/Ga <b>flow</b> <b>ratios,</b> the annealed nanorods clearly display a donor-acceptor pair band emission peaking at 3. 26 - 3. 27 eV and up to 4 LO phonon replicas, which can be considered as a reliable indicator of effective p-type Mg doping in the nanorod shell. For higher Mg/Ga <b>flow</b> <b>ratios,</b> a substantial enhancement of the yellow luminescence emission as well as several emission subbands are observed, which suggests an increase of disorder and the presence of defects {{as a consequence of the}} excess Mg doping.

A study of the luminescence emission distribution over the {{different regions of the}} nanowires is presented. We have investigated the CL fingerprints of the Mg incorporation into the non-polar lateral prismatic facets and the semi-polar facets of the pyramidal tips.
