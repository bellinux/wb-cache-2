Renoir later said he chose Sologne because his father Pierre-August Renoir [...] "regretted {{that he had never}} been able to paint [...] <b>How</b> <b>well</b> <b>I</b> understand the sincerity of those regrets before these beautiful landscapes of Sologne, in astonishing colors, of a grace so melancholy yet so gentle." [...] Renoir said Sologne's mist [...] "took me back to the happy days of my childhood." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cruyff was a multilingual, as British {{football}} writer Brian Glanville described, “his intelligence off {{the field}} {{as well as on}} it was quite remarkable. <b>How</b> <b>well</b> <b>I</b> remember seeing Cruyff surrounded by journalists {{from all over the world}} in 1978 to whose questions he replied almost casually in a multiplicity of languages. Not only Dutch, but English, French, Spanish and German.” ...|$|E

[...] "It is through Sam, that most of our principles have come, that is {{he has been the}} connecting link for them, it is what Ebby learned from Sam and what Ebby told me that makes up the linkage between Sam the man of religion, and ourselves. <b>How</b> <b>well</b> <b>I</b> remember that first day I caught sight of Sam, it was a Sunday service in his church. I was still rather gun-shy and diffident about churches. I can still see him standing there before the lectern, and Sam's utter honesty, his tremendous forthrightness, his almost terrible sincerity struck me deep. I shall never forget it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Booth {{made his}} {{comeback}} on 3 November 2006 {{moving up to}} bantamweight with a win over journeyman Abdul Mghrbel at the Barnsley Metrodome almost two years since his defeat to Kelly. He followed this up in February 2007 with a win against Jamil Hussain and then on 6 July 2007 stepped into the ring with former opponent Ian Napa to challenge for the British bantamweight title. The fight at the Robin Park Centre in Wigan saw Napa gain revenge for his defeat in 2000 with a 12-round points victory. The same venue {{would prove to be}} the location for his next fight as Booth returned on 8 December 2007 to defeat Welsh prospect Matthew Edmonds for the Commonwealth title. The win over Edmonds meant that Jason Booth could now claim to be a two weight Commonwealth champion. He defended his new title on 7 March 2008, against Ghana's Lante Addy, and won a non-title bout against Dai Davies in June 2008. He made a second defence on 18 December 2008 with Dublin being the location for a challenge from Pontefract-based fighter Sean Hughes. Booth won the fight in the 10th round following a corner retirement from Hughes. After the fight with Hughes, Booth said that he [...] "didn't realise <b>how</b> <b>well</b> <b>I</b> boxed" [...] and would now like a rematch with Ian Napa as they had [...] "unfinished business." ...|$|E
