5|$|By 1967, I-35 {{had been}} {{constructed}} through Oklahoma City. On January 4, 1967, SH-74 was {{split into two}} sections, with {{the removal of the}} section between Goldsby and Norman. The southern section was truncated on December 12, 1974, bringing the highway to its current southern terminus. The <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> sections of SH-74 was widened on March 3, 1975, when the route was eliminated through Cleveland County and much of Oklahoma City, bringing SH-74 to its present-day termini.|$|E
5|$|The current {{designation}} {{was assigned}} in 1929 as a second, disconnected section of highway. This new routing ran from US10/US23 in Clio {{by way of}} Frankenmuth to Reese. The <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> sections was filled in a year later when M-84 in Tuscola County was redesignated as part of M-83. After this change, M-83 continued north from Reese through Gilford and Akron to Unionville. There it ran concurrently along M-29 to Bay Port, connecting the two segments.|$|E
5|$|The hookbill's {{distinguishing}} characteristic was a heavy, parrotlike bill. The {{upper mandible}} hooked sharply downwards, while the heavy lower mandible hooked sharply upwards towards {{the middle of}} the upper mandible. This structure left a <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> mandibles when the bird held its beak closed. It is believed that the bill was pale pink in coloration. The jaw muscles were particularly well developed around the bill. The hookbill's tongue was primitive and nontubular.|$|E

5|$|The new {{gap between}} Hamilton and Massa in the Drivers' Championship {{after the race}} stood at fourpoints in Hamilton's favour. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren {{somewhat}} caught up on Ferrari, although the <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> teams was still sizeable at 19points. McLaren were ten points behind BMW coming into the race and the deficit was reduced to three due to the race result.|$|E

5|$|By 1962, {{both the}} United States and the Soviet Union had flown two solo spaceflights in the Space Race. There was a {{widespread}} perception, however, that the United States was falling behind; its two missions had been suborbital and had {{lasted only a}} few minutes. The Soviet missions had both orbited the Earth, and the second, Vostok 2, had remained in orbit for a full day. Using the new high-powered Atlas booster, the coming orbital Mercury missions were expected to reduce the <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> countries.|$|E
5|$|In the aye-aye, {{which has}} {{replaced}} the toothcomb by evolving continually growing, rodent-like incisors, the hook-shaped tip of the sublingua fits precisely within the <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> lower incisors and keeps the area clean. Tarsiers lack a toothcomb, {{which may explain why}} their sublingua lacks the serrations typically found on the sublingua of lemuriforms. Although colugos also have a toothcomb, consisting of serrated edges on the tips of their incisors instead of finely spaced, elongated teeth, {{they do not have a}} sublingua. Instead, their toothcomb is cleaned by the tongue, which has serrated edges at the front that match the serrations on the incisors.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the center}} of the county in the town of Sodus, NY104 serves as the {{northern}} terminus of NY88 northwest of the village of Sodus. While NY88 heads east into the village, NY104 bypasses Sodus to the north. East of the village, Ridge Road and NY104 intersect as Ridge Road flips to the north side of NY104. The two highways follow parallel routings southeast toward Alton, where NY104 intersects NY14. East of Alton, the <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> widens as Ridge Road veers north to access Sodus Bay. NY104, meanwhile, follows a nearly linear routing into the town of Huron, where it intersects the northern terminus of NY414.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> idea of <b>two</b> {{conductor}} stripline is {{to compensate}} for air <b>gaps</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> substrates. Small air gaps are inevitable because of manufacturing tolerances and {{the thickness of the}} conductor. These gaps can promote radiation away from <b>the</b> line <b>between</b> <b>the</b> ground planes. Printing identical conductors on both boards ensures the fields are equal in both substrates and the electric field in the gaps due to <b>the</b> <b>two</b> lines cancels out. Usually, one line is made slightly undersize to prevent small misalignments effectively widening the line, and consequently reducing the characteristic impedance.|$|R

5|$|On July 1, 1919, the M-65 {{designation}} {{was used}} on two, discontinuous {{roads in the}} southern part of the Lower Peninsula.

The <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> segments was eliminated by the middle of 1926.

5|$|On lap 40, Ericsson {{started to}} slow on track and {{eventually}} retired. One lap later, Hamilton moved into second ahead of Ricciardo {{on the main}} straight. Lap 42 saw first Sainz and then Verstappen overtake Palmer's Renault, who fell back to eleventh. Another lap later, Ricciardo changed tyres and came out fifth behind Massa, taking fourth three laps later. At the front, Hamilton and Vettel slowly closed on Rosberg, with the <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> also coming down.

5|$|Previously, the M-83 {{designation}} {{was used}} for a highway in the Upper Peninsula between 1919 and 1926. Immediately after that, the moniker was used to supplant the M-31 designation in The Thumb area. A disconnected segment of highway was given the M-83 name in 1929 in the Frankenmuth area. The <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> roads was eliminated within a year. By {{the end of the}} 1930s, the highway was truncated to its current northern terminus in the Richville area, removing The Thumb area segments. The last changes rerouted the southern end to connect with I-75 after that freeway was opened in 1962.|$|E

5|$|Prior {{to turning}} onto Rutgers Street, CR-506 runs along Washington Street {{concurrent}} {{with the northern}} section of Route 7. Though the northern section of Route 7 begins a few blocks south, it is not readily recognized (minimal signing). As CR-506 runs concurrently with it here, and then turns down Rutgers for the short distance that bridges the <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> Route 7 sections, Rutgers/506 is often viewed as if it continues Route 7, while the short portion of the northern section that lies south of Rutgers is sometimes seen as a spur, {{even though it is}} part of the main route.|$|E
5|$|The {{first state}} {{highways}} along the US23 corridor were numbered M-65 from the Ohio line {{north to the}} Flint area and M-10 from Flint north to Mackinaw City by July 1, 1919.

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Alonso moved back into the lead of the Drivers' Championship on 231 points. Webber's failure to score meant he fell to second, eleven points behind Alonso. Hamilton's second-place finish resulted in him moving ahead of Vettel, with Button remaining in fifth. Red Bull still led the Constructors' Championship despite not getting both cars to the finish. McLaren remained in second with 399 points; Ferrari had caught up to McLaren, the <b>gap</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> teams reduced to 25 points with two races of the season remaining. Given Alonso's new lead, Vettel acknowledged his team had the fastest car in the season's two remaining races and remained confident of winning the Drivers' Championship. After the conclusion of the championship in Vettel's favour by four points, Webber's manager Flavio Briatore highlighted the Korean Grand Prix as one of Webber's most obvious lost opportunities in his bid to win the title.|$|E
