The composition design, smelting process, continuous casting and rolling process of the steel, {{as well as the}} mechanical properties of the <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>product</b> are introduced in the paper. An analysis on the strengthening mechanism of the high strength steel shows that the enhanced strength and toughness of the steel were caused by the refinement of ferrite grain and the precipitation strengthening of TiC...|$|E
40|$|To {{obtain a}} low cost, {{environmentally}} friendly and effective lubricant, a novel nanoTiO 2 additive oil-in-water (O/W) lubricant for hot steel rolling has been developed. Based on the contact angle, tribological and hot rolling tests, {{the performance of}} the nanoTiO 2 additive O/W lubricants was evaluated and discussed. The results show that the strongest adhesion force between the nanoTiO 2 additive O/W lubricant and the work roll is obtained after addition of 4 % nanoTiO 2 additive in the 1 % O/W lubricant. The nanoTiO 2 nanoparticles can reduce coefficient of friction (COF) and rolling force, and enhance the surface quality of the <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>product.</b> The lubrication mechanism of nanoTiO 2 additive O/W-based lubricant has been proposed...|$|E
40|$|This work {{studied the}} effect of rolling process {{parameters}} at different rolling strain rates, % total deformations and finish rolling temperatures on the mechanical properties of hot-rolled St 60 Mn steel. The rolling process parameters studied included finish rolling temperature, % total deformation and rolling strain rates. The results were compared with existing literature on rolling carbon steels. The tensile strength, yield strength, hardness, young’s modulus of elasticity, toughness, bendability, % enlongation and % reduction in area of the <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>product</b> were obtained. The {{results showed that the}} rolling process parameters remarkably influenced the mechanical properties of St 60 Mn steel. The trend in property change was dictated by rolling strain rate, % total deformation and finish rolling temperature. It was concluded that increasing the rolling strain rate from 6. 02851  ×  103 s-' to 6. 10388  ×  103 s-', using % total deformations of 99 % and finish rolling temperature of 958  °C enhanced the mechanical properties of St 60 Mn steel...|$|E

For example, Verlag Stahleisen [4] have categorised surface defects of <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>products</b> in nine main classes and 29 subclasses. These defects are not governed by any standard. Thus, their characteristics and classification vary from mill to mill and from operator to operator. Further, manifestation of these defects changes due to variations in production process.|$|R

A clear and significant relation between the applied thermo-mechanical process and the microstructural evolution was shown, and it is useful for designing the steel microstructure.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development of}} models for predicting (1) constitutive behaviors and (2) mechanical properties of hot-rolled steels as functions of chemical composition, microstructural features, and processing variables. The study includes the following eight steels: A 36, DQSK, HSLA-V, HSLA-Nb, HSLA- 50 /Ti-Nb, and two interstitial-free (IF) grades.

The problem of {{brittleness}} of the Ni-Mn-Gabased alloys can largely be overcome in case of Ni–Fe–Ga-based ones by introducing a disordered fcc γ-phase. The current study explores thermo-mechanical processing of this alloy using an off-stoichiometric Ni 55 Fe 19 Ga 26 alloy containing the ductile γ-phase. Hot-rolling of Ni 55 Fe 19 Ga 26 alloy was carried out at 950 ∘C and 1000 ∘C, both with and without mild steel jacket.

South Korean wages {{were too high}} to support {{a whole range of}} activities and POSCO looked elsewhere for new projects while keeping the areas where they have a comparative advantage in South Korea. By 2006, POSCO had 26 subsidiaries and invested over $2.4 billion in fresh investment on mainland China, especially in galvanized and stainless steel to supply global auto and appliance makers that have opened plants there. In 2006, POSCO started operating the Zhangjiagang Pohang Stainless Steel (ZPSS) steel mill capable of producing 600,000 tons of stainless steel and <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>products</b> annually in China’s Jiangsu Province. As a result, POSCO became the first foreign firm operating an integrated stainless steel mill in China, handling the entire production process from smelting iron ore to finished products, including the cold rolled stainless plant it already operates.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Products {{featuring}} very irregular surfaces, such as-cast slabs or billets, {{have remained}} {{an issue for}} non-destructive detection of cracks with eddy-current testing. However multiplexed arrays probes seem a promising solution to overcome the productivity/resolution challenge; they also allow easy imaging. A specific multiplexing pattern based on transmit receive elements, which are almost insensitive to lift-off variations on normal metal allows detecting such surfacebreaking flaws with little perturbations from the surface. To {{meet the challenge of}} the lift-off/resolution compromise, a special geometrical arrangement was imagined, which has to be respected. Finally multiplexing features inspection in attainable widths typically 100 mm with a 5 mm cross resolution. We describe here the work comparing the figures of merit (resolution, lift-off) of several multiplexing patterns, with first investigations on a high surface quality finished sample with EDM notches, then on notches and apparent cracks on rough as-cast surfaces: 5 mm long cracks seem to be detectable with a 3 mm nominal stand-off. Finally we discuss the possibilities which this new technique opens for applications in the steel industry, especially for as-cast surfaces and <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R
40|$|Several {{complicated}} technological problems had to {{be solved}} to develop an alternative technology {{for the production of}} nichrome strips, the new technology involving the rolling of cast ingots and drawing of the <b>hot-rolled</b> semifinished <b>products.</b> In the traditional technology, sheet is hot- and cold-rolled and then cut lengthwise to form the strips. One particularly important advance over the existing technology is the improvement made to the geometry of the drawing channel in the hard-alloy dies. This modification significantly reduces die wear, practically eliminates breakage of the strip during drawing, and substantially improves the quality of the strip's surface. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R
40|$|The {{procedure}} of mechanical alloying {{makes it possible}} to obtain, with the aid of powder-metallurgy techniques, alloys that consist of a metallic matrix in which very fine oxide particles are dispersed. Mechanically alloyed compound powders can be used for making either forged or <b>hot-rolled</b> semifinished <b>products.</b> For these products, dispersion strengthening and precipitation hardening has been combined. At high temperatures, the strength characteristics of the alloy are determined by both dispersion hardening and by precipitation hardening processes. The effect produced by each process is independent of that due to the other. Attention is given to the principle of mechanical alloying developed by Benjamin (1970, 1976), the strength characteristics of mechanically alloyed materials, the corrosion resistance of mechanically alloyed material at high temperatures, and the preparation and characteristics of the alloy MA 6000 E...|$|R
40|$|Electric {{induction}} reheating is used {{to control}} the temperature of <b>hot-rolled</b> steel <b>products.</b> To investigate {{the effect of this}} on microstructure and mechanical properties, hot-rolled low-alloy steel plate was cooled, reheated, and then either quenched or normalized. Analysis of the microstructure and mechanical properties showed that this process had a greater effect on quenched steel plate than on normalized steel plate. Reheating was found to affect the precipitation of alloy carbonitrides, and the recovery and recrystallization of deformed austenite. In the single-phase region, the lower cooling temperature resulted in better mechanical properties. In normalized steel plate, the interlamellar spacing of pearlite (ISP) increased from 118 nm to 165 nm after induction reheating. In steel plate quenched with a 70 &# 186;C temperature difference, induction reheating reduced the strength difference from 80 MPa to 23 MPa. Our results provide useful references for optimizing electric induction and improving the uniformity of the mechanical properties of low-alloy steel...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: pages 96 - 102. During the {{annealing}} {{treatment in}} the production of dual phase steels, partitfoning of alloying elements can occur depending on competitive solubility in the ferrite and austenite for the specific partitioning species. An investigation of the partitioning of substitutional elements was considered paramount in understanding certain anomalies that had been identified by previous researchers in various studies of a dualphase 12 % Chromium steel, designated 3 CR 12. These anomalies concerned observed increases in bulk hardness that could not be attributed to changes in the volume fraction of martensite produced after exposure to a range of temperatures within the dual phase field. Subsequent experiments revealed an unexpected increase in the microhardness of the martensite phase prOduced by heat {{treatment in the}} temperature range of interest. In this thesis conventional analytical measurements using Energy dispersive X-ray analysis facilities attached to a Scanning Electron microscope have been utilised to determine the compositions of the two phases in the alloy. A range of temperatures in the dual phase region have been investigated at holding durations of 1, 4 and 20 hours. It was found that partitioning of substitutional elements was occurring, however no changes were observed as a function of holding time. Further empirical data was obtained using dilatometric methods. This strongly suggested that interstitial concentrations were increasing as a function of annealing time and clarified the anomalies observed during previous studies on 3 CR 12. Further study includes that of substitutional element partitioning in the prior states of the commercially produced hot-rolled and annealed 3 CR 12 alloy. These include the as cast slab and the hot-rolled slab, as well as the final hot-rolled and annealed slab. Segregation was found to occur in the as cast slab. Subsequent investigation showed the presence of δ-ferrite in the final processing stages of the <b>hot-rolled</b> and annealed <b>product...</b>|$|R
