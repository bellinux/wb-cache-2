5|$|Mortality is {{high for}} eggs and hatchlings, and nests face threats from floods, overheating, and predators. Flooding {{is a major}} cause of failure of {{crocodilians}} to breed successfully, as nests are submerged, developing embryos are deprived of oxygen, and juveniles get washed away. One of the chief predators of alligators' eggs in Florida is the raccoon, which is attracted by olfactory cues after the nest has been disturbed by turtles. The Florida black bear also raids alligator eggs. In Africa, mongooses, <b>honey</b> <b>badgers,</b> baboons, otters, warthogs, bushpigs, and spotted hyenas are all fond of crocodile eggs, but the monitor lizard is thought {{to be the most important}} nest raider. This lizard is also a major hazard in Asia, where other egg predators include civets, mongooses, rats, sloth bears, jackals, and dogs.|$|E
5|$|Unpalatability, broadly understood, can {{be created}} {{in a variety of}} ways. Some insects such as the {{ladybird}} or tiger moth contain bitter-tasting chemicals, while the skunk produces a noxious odour, and the poison glands of the poison dart frog, the sting of a velvet ant or neurotoxin in a black widow spider make them dangerous or painful to attack. Tiger moths advertise their unpalatability by either producing ultrasonic noises which warn bats to avoid them, or by warning postures which expose brightly coloured body parts (see Unkenreflex), or exposing eyespots. Velvet ants (actually parasitic wasps) such as Dasymutilla occidentalis both have bright colours and produce audible noises when grabbed (via stridulation), which serve to reinforce the warning. Among mammals, predators can be dissuaded when a smaller animal is aggressive and able to defend itself, as for example in <b>honey</b> <b>badgers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pigs {{are one of}} four known {{mammalian}} species which possess {{mutations in}} the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor that protect against snake venom. Mongooses, <b>honey</b> <b>badgers,</b> hedgehogs, and pigs all have modifications to the receptor pocket which prevents the snake venom α-neurotoxin from binding. These represent four separate, independent mutations.|$|E

2500|$|The Cape cobra (Naja nivea), {{also called}} the yellow cobra, is a moderate-sized, highly venomous species of cobra inhabiting {{a wide variety of}} biomes across {{southern}} Africa including arid savanna, fynbos, bushveld, desert and semi-desert regions. The species is diurnal and is a feeding generalist, preying on a number of different species and carrion.

The Cape cobra is also known as the [...] "geelslang" [...] (yellow snake) and [...] "bruinkapel" [...] (brown cobra) in South Africa. Afrikaans speaking South Africans also refer to the Cape cobra as [...] "koperkapel" [...] ("copper cobra"), mainly because of a rich yellow colour variation.

50|$|Next to the wolverine, {{the honey}} badger has the least {{specialised}} diet of the weasel family. In undeveloped areas, <b>honey</b> <b>badgers</b> may hunt {{at any time}} of the day, though they become nocturnal in places with high human populations. When hunting, they trot with their foretoes turned in. <b>Honey</b> <b>badgers</b> favour bee honey, and will often search for beehives to get it, which earns them their name. They are also carnivorous and will eat insects, frogs, tortoises, rodents, turtles, lizards, snakes, eggs, and birds. <b>Honey</b> <b>badgers</b> have even been known to chase away young lions and take their kills. They will eat fruit and vegetables, such as berries, roots and bulbs. Despite popular belief, {{there is no evidence that}} honeyguides (a bird species that eats bee larvae) guide the honey badger.|$|E
