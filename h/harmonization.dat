During the 2004–2008 period, public debt was reduced from over 60% of GDP to 10% and official reserves quadrupled to over USD 3billion. Cameroon is part of the Bank of Central African States (of which it is the dominant economy), the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa (UDEAC) and the Organization for the <b>Harmonization</b> of Business Law in Africa (OHADA).

5|$|In 1857, Cayley {{introduced}} matrix notation, {{which allows}} for a <b>harmonization</b> and simplification of linear maps. Around the same time, Grassmann studied the barycentric calculus initiated by Möbius. He envisaged sets of abstract objects endowed with operations. In his work, the concepts of linear independence and dimension, as well as scalar products, are present. In fact, Grassmann's 1844 work exceeds the framework of vector spaces, since his consideration of multiplication led him to what are today called algebras. Peano {{was the first to}} give the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps in 1888.|$|E

5|$|The Ebionite gospel is {{one example}} of a type of gospel harmony that used the Gospel of Matthew as a base text but did not include the Gospel of John; it is {{believed}} to pre-date Tatian's Diatessaron (c.170) which included all four canonical gospels. The gospel has a parallel to a quotation in a mid-2nd-century homily known as 2 Clement, suggesting that both may be dependent on a harmonizing tradition from an earlier 2nd century source. The harmonized gospel sayings sources used by Justin Martyr to compose his First Apology and Dialogue with Trypho were similarly based on the Synoptic Gospels. According to scholar George Howard, <b>harmonization</b> was a widely used method of composition in the early Patristic period. Many of the heterodox variants found in the Gospel of the Ebionites may have been adopted from a larger pool of variants that were in circulation; an example is the appearance of a great light that shone during Jesus' Baptism which is also found in the Diatessaron.|$|E

5000|$|By contrast, Boyd {{notes that}} [...] "the <b>harmonizations</b> are often heavy and conventional, and the {{structure}} loose". He also compares the orchestration unfavourably with that of Hoddinott's Welsh Dances (Set 1 - 1956; Set 2 - 1969) and Mathias's Celtic Dances (1972).|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} texts aim {{to provide a}} single <b>harmonization</b> of the {{canonical}} gospels, that eliminates discordances among them by presenting a unified text derived from them to some degree. The most widely read of these was the Diatessaron.|$|E

25|$|A {{metrical}} psalter {{is a kind}} of Bible translation: a book {{containing a}} metrical translation of {{all or part of the}} Book of Psalms in vernacular poetry, meant to be sung as hymns in a church.

25|$|The other {{approach}} is to construct a whole new system of EU company law, that co-exists with the individual company laws of the member states. Companies would have the choice of operating either under national regulations or under the EU-wide system. However, this approach has been only somewhat {{more effective than the}} <b>harmonization</b> approach: while states are not as concerned about having foreign traditions of corporate governance imposed on their companies, which the <b>harmonization</b> approach could well entail; they also wish to ensure that the EU-wide system would be palatable to the traditions of their national companies, so {{that they will not be}} put at a disadvantage compared to the other member states.|$|E

25|$|Another genre {{is that of}} gospel harmonies, {{in which}} the four {{canonical}} gospels were selectively recast as a single narrative to present a consistent text.

50|$|Ernani Braga's {{earliest}} compositions {{date from}} the beginning of 1920s. According to his daughter Vera, they were highly influenced by German lied tradition and by the works of Robert Schumann particularly. The composer's acquaintance with Villa-Lobos and other modernists along with folklore researches made him a follower of Mário de Andrade's nationalistic ideas. His compositions usually include elements of Brazilian folk music, and his most important works are thought to be <b>harmonizations</b> of folk songs.|$|R
