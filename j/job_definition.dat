30|$|To allow {{resources}} to scale dynamically {{in response to}} the workload we have extended the Jenkins system by adding an external monitoring daemon that starts instances in response to changes in the build queue. Instance configurations are defined in the a central configuration file and assigned labels matching the labels defined in the job configurations in Jenkins. This allows a 1 :n mapping between instance configurations and <b>job</b> <b>definitions</b> to be created so that different jobs can share instance configurations and instances.|$|R
40|$|More {{powerful}} managers {{make more}} important decisions. Therefore, firm performance is more informative about {{the abilities of}} such managers, who, realizing {{that they are more}} visible, are more eager to improve performance. If this reputation effect exists, how should firms allocate power? I analyze the optimal allocation of power and derive implications for several issues that often arise in management practice: the choice of departmentation criteria, the importance given to seniority, and the width of <b>job</b> <b>definitions.</b> Finally, I show that the model is consistent with the empirical evidence on managerial succession. ...|$|R

The productivity regressions demonstrate that lines using a set of innovative work practices, which include incentive pay, teams, flexible job assignments, employment security, and training, achieve substantially higher levels of productivity than do lines with the more traditional approach, which includes narrow <b>job</b> <b>definitions,</b> strict work rules, and hourly pay with close supervision.

30|$|The {{first step}} in the {{adaptation}} study showed that there are indeed similarities between Germany and Switzerland but that an adaptation may also entail difficulties as a result of different commercial work conditions (e.g., <b>job</b> <b>definitions,</b> commercial activities and different branches) and cultural characteristics (e.g., language, interpersonal behavior, and company structures). Thus, a closer analysis of the simulation’s operationalization and synchronization was required, especially with respect to its contextualization, construct representativeness, and IT components. Unfortunately, previous studies (e.g., Fitzgerald 2005; Geisinger 1994; Lokan and Fleming 2003) proved to be of limited assistance as they revealed a research and methodological gap concerning the adaptation of computer-based tests, particularly in VET. This gap required the development of a suitable procedure for adapting computer-based tests in VET.|$|R

A new export function developed for this Master thesis allows the selection of template parameters and produces a workflow template. Template parametrisation is much easier than workflow creation from scratch.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that leader-member {{exchange}} (LMX) and perceived organizational support (POS) influence organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) through the mediation of <b>job</b> <b>definition</b> and felt responsibility. It has also been argued that work autonomy and required interaction serve as situational constraints on OCB. In other words, work autonomy and required interaction will interact with both LMX and POS in determining OCB. Data from this field study does not support the mediation role of either <b>job</b> <b>definition</b> or felt responsibility. Although LMX and POS were found to relate to <b>job</b> <b>definition</b> and felt responsibility, they were unrelated to employees' OCB as rated by their supervisors. The data provides partial support for the hypotheses that work autonomy moderate the relationship between LMX and POS and OCB.

40|$|What are the {{performance}} benefits {{of investing in}} human resources in a low-cost labor environment where returns to such investment are widely perceived as negligible? This paper presents a matched pair case study on {{the performance}} effect of human resource management systems at two garment factories manufacturing for export in India. They make the same product for the same buyer with the same local pool of labor. One factory views its workforce as a variable cost to be minimized, limits training, prefers strict hierarchy and <b>job</b> <b>definitions.</b> It relies {{on a range of}} factors including the offer of overtime and a lack of available alternatives to workers for retention. The other factory, which is located almost next door and pays the same basic wage, focuses on skills development, opportunities for promotion and encouraging employee participation. Employee turnover at the first factory is almost three times greater than that of the second, its absenteeism one third higher, while its product quality is 2. 6 times lower and its production efficiency over 28 percent lower. This study demonstrates that even in a low-wage environment, HRM and work organization have a tangible and independent impact on performance...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly, {{firms are}} {{considering}} {{the adoption of}} new work practices, such as problem-solving teams, enhanced communication with workers, employment security, flexibility in job assignments, training workers for multiple jobs, and greater reliance on incentive pay. This paper provides empirical evidence to address the question: do these human resource management practices improve worker productivity? For this study, we constructed our own data base through personal site visits to 26 steel plants which contained one specific steelmaking process, and collected longitudinal data with precise measures on productivity, work practices, and the technology in these production lines. The empirical results consistently support the following conclusion: {{the adoption of a}} coherent system of these new work practices, including work teams, flexible job assignments, employment security, training in multiple jobs, and extensive reliance on incentive pay, produces substantially higher levels of productivity than do more 'traditional' approaches involving narrow <b>job</b> <b>definitions,</b> strict work rules, and hourly pay with close supervision. In contrast, adopting individual work practice innovations in isolation has no effect on productivity. We interpret this evidence as support for recent theoretical models which stress the importance of complementarities among a firm's work practices. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the HRM {{practices}} of public and private universities in Punjab province of Pakistan. The data for the study was collected through a questionnaire comprising 30 items mainly related to <b>job</b> <b>definition,</b> training and development, compensation, team work, employee’s participation and performance appraisal. The instrument was validated through pilot testing. The internal reliability of the instrument was found to be 0. 85. The sample was comprised of 60 executives (directors/heads of departments) selected randomly from six universities. The collected data was analyzed by applying descriptive and inferential statistical techniques such as means and independent sample t-test. The results showed that there was a significant difference in HRM practices according to executives of public and private universities. HRM practices in the areas of <b>job</b> <b>definition,</b> training and development, compensation, team work and employees participation were better in the public universities than private universities. However, performance appraisal practices were found better in the private universities than public sector universities. At the end recommendations were made for the HRM executives of private and public universities to improve their HRM practices in favor of their employees. </p...|$|E
40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} helpful, and clearest, {{definition}} of {{culture is the}} idea that is 'the way we do things around here'. In education that simple phrase covers a multitude of possibilities in understanding how schools work. What does seem to be consistent is that school culture is to a very significant extent the product of leadership behaviours and values. A key manifestation of a school's culture is the status of creativity. The following questions help set out the possible range of issues associated with creating and sustaining a culture of creativity: to what extent can the relationships in the school be characterised as high-trust? Is creativity an explicit component of school policies, strategies and <b>job</b> <b>definitions?</b> How does the school define the learning process? Are learning and creativity seen as symbiotically related? How widely distributed is leadership? How is leadership defined? In what ways is creativity recognised and celebrated in school? The article explores these questions by first asking, 'why focus on creativity?' then examining the characteristics of creative people. The author concludes that if creativity is to be appropriately valued and achieve the necessary status then the key behaviours of leaders may have to change. [Author abstract, ed...|$|R
40|$|In {{advanced}} industrial societies social, economic, {{and technological}} changes {{are accompanied by}} changing values and attitudes to work, symptomatic of what some see as {{the transition to a}} post-industrial era. As a result existing <b>job</b> <b>definitions</b> and traditional forms of organization are being challenged and attempts made to restructure work so that it becomes meaningful and rewarding in the fullest sense, to the individual, to the enterprise, and to society. These range from programmes of job enlargement and job enrichment, within the framework of existing technologies, to experiments in the design of organizations as a whole in which fewer constraints are accepted as given. They entail and require a multidisciplinary approach as well as awareness of and commitment to the underlying values. The possibilities and benefits of restructuring work in these various ways have been demonstrated sufficiently to encourage interest at governmental level as well as by employers and trade unions. There are, however, no simple prescriptions or principles of universal application. Knowledge is still tentative and partial but there is consensus that the search for new ways of dealing with the organization of work and the allocation of resources is of fundamental importance...|$|R
