After creating an early body of work made up of closed form wooden objects, heavily-lacquered by hand, in the mid-1960s he “decided to remove the skin altogether and reveal the structure.” This skeletal form, the radically simplified open cube, became a basic building block of the artist’s three-dimensional work. In the mid-1960s, LeWitt began to work with the open cube: twelve equal linear elements connected at eight corners to form a skeletal structure. From 1969, he would conceive many of his modular structures on a large scale, to be constructed in aluminum or steel by industrial fabricators. Each of his large open cubes is 63 inches high, approximately <b>eye</b> <b>level.</b> <b>At</b> this scale, the artist introduced bodily proportion to his fundamental sculptural unit.|$|E

There are hundreds and thousands of young Englishmen who look exactly as Luke de Mountford looked that morning: dress is almost a uniform, in cut, style, and degree of tone; hair and even features are essentially typical. Luke de Mountford, well-born, well-bred, behaved just as Eton and Oxford had taught him to behave, concealing every emotion, raising neither voice nor gesture. An Englishman of that type has alternately been dubbed hypocritical, and unemotional. He is neither; he is only conventional. Luke himself, facing the most abnormal condition of life that could assail any man of his class, was so absolutely drilled into this semblance of placidity that it cost him no effort to restrain himself, and none to face the forest of inquisitive <b>eyes</b> <b>levelled</b> <b>at</b> him from every side.

40|$|Background: To {{investigate}} IOP control following {{twelve months}} of continuous medical therapy in Gha-na. Methods: This retrospective case series included 163 glaucoma patients diagnosed at a referral eye center between 1996 and 2006. Information collected includ-ed age, gender, IOP at presentation, {{six months and}} one year post treatment and types of anti-glaucoma medica-tions prescribed. Optimal IOP control was defined ac-cording to results from the Advanced Glaucoma Inter-vention Study (AGIS), which demonstrated arrest of visual field progression in patients with IOP < 18 mmHg <b>at</b> all visitations: <b>Level</b> 1 (post-treatment IOP ≤ 21 mmHg); Level 2 (≤ 18 mmHg) and level 3 (≤ 16 mmHg). The principal outcome measure was the achievement of IOP < 18 mmHg at six months and twelve month visitations. Results: One hundred sixty three patients were ana-lyzed. These included 68 males (41. 7 %) and 95 fe-males (58. 3 %). The mean age was 57 ± 16 (median 59 years; range 7 – 95 years).

5000|$|When {{the head}} is stationary, the {{binaural}} cues for lateral sound localization (interaural time difference and interaural level difference) do not give information about {{the location of a}} sound in the median plane. Identical ITDs and ILDs can be produced by sounds <b>at</b> <b>eye</b> <b>level</b> or <b>at</b> any elevation, as long as the lateral direction is constant. However, if {{the head is}} rotated, the ITD and ILD change dynamically, and those changes are different for sounds at different elevations. For example, if an eye-level sound source is straight ahead and the head turns to the left, the sound becomes louder (and arrives sooner) at the right ear than at the left. But if the sound source is directly overhead, there will be no change in the ITD and ILD as the head turns. Intermediate elevations will produce intermediate degrees of change, and if the presentation of binaural cues to the two ears during head movement is reversed, the sound will be heard behind the listener. [...] Hans Wallach [...] artificially altered a sound’s binaural cues during movements of the head. Although the sound was objectively placed <b>at</b> <b>eye</b> <b>level,</b> the dynamic changes to ITD and ILD as the head rotated were those that would be produced if the sound source had been elevated. In this situation, the sound was heard at the synthesized elevation. The fact that the sound sources objectively remained <b>at</b> <b>eye</b> <b>level</b> prevented monaural cues from specifying the elevation, showing that it was the dynamic change in the binaural cues during head movement that allowed the sound to be correctly localized in the vertical dimension. The head movements need not be actively produced; accurate vertical localization occurred in a similar setup when the head rotation was produced passively, by seating the blindfolded subject in a rotating chair. As long as the dynamic changes in binaural cues accompanied a perceived head rotation, the synthesized elevation was perceived.|$|R

Ergonomic and safety engineering practices occasionally {{appear to be in}} conflict in the design of a safe and healthful workplace. Al-though the safety of the operator is of paramount importance, the design of an "ul-trasafe " workplace might require postures and motions that could have unfavorable long-term health consequences. For example, sheet metal fabrication requires a multitude of various size stamping and weld presses that must be equipped with guards or devices to assure operator safety. Some operations can be safeguarded with fixed barrier guards and slide feeds. However, as the metal-forming process continues through a press line, it becomes increasingly more difficult to design feed systems to assure proper place-ment of part to fixture. When operators must use their hands or a hand tool to orient parts directly on the dies, other means of safe-guarding must be employed.

5000|$|Lift is {{generated}} {{in the same way}} as a traditional airfoil. The rotating frisbee has a nearly vertical angular momentum vector, stabilizing its angle of attack via gyroscopic action. If the disc were not spinning, it would crash to the ground. When the disc is spinning, however, aerodynamic torque instead leads to precess about the spin axis, causing its trajectory to curve to the left or the right. Most discs are designed to be aerodynamically stable so that this roll is accurate for a fairly broad range of velocities and rates of spin. Many disc golf discs, however, are intentionally designed to be unstable. Higher rates of spin lead to more stability, and, for a given rate of spin, there is generally a range of velocities that are stable. Even a slight deformation in a disc (called a [...] "taco," [...] which in extreme cases looks like a taco shell) can cause negative effects when throwing long range. A disk can be checked for these deformations by holding it horizontally <b>at</b> <b>eye</b> <b>level</b> and looking <b>at</b> the rim while slowly turning it.|$|R

In the present study, we investigated the influence on single neurons of the medial PPC area V 6 A of vergence and version signals. Single-unit activity was recorded from V 6 A in two Macaca fascicularis fixating real targets in darkness. The fixation targets were placed <b>at</b> <b>eye</b> <b>level</b> and <b>at</b> different vergence and version angles within the peripersonal space.

In single cells, version and vergence influenced the discharge with variable time course. In several cases, the two gaze variables influence neural discharges during only a part of the fixation time, but, more often, their influence persisted through large parts of it. Cells discharging for the first 400 - 500 ms of fixation could signal the arrival of gaze (and/or of spotlight of attention) in a new position in the peripersonal space. Cells showing a more sustained activity during the fixation period could better signal the location in space of the gazed objects. Both signals are critical for the control of upcoming or ongoing arm movements, such as those needed to reach and grasp objects located in the peripersonal space...|$|R
