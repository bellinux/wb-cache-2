5|$|Tadalafil was {{initially}} formulated by Glaxo Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) {{under a new}} drug development partnership between Glaxo and Icos that began in August1991. The <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> originally researched {{as a treatment for}} cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and angina, but focus quickly shifted to ED with the success of another PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil (Viagra), which had been developed by Pfizer. Icos began research on tadalafil in 1993, and clinical trials started two years later. Glaxo let the partnership with Icos lapse in 1996, including the company's 50% share of profits from resulting drugs, because the drugs in development were not in Glaxo's core markets. In 1998, Icos formed a 50/50 joint venture with Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly (Lilly Icos LLC) to develop and commercialize tadalafil as Cialis. The release of Cialis in the United States was delayed in April2002 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that Icos perform more studies, improve labelling, and address manufacturing issues. Cialis was approved in Europe in November2002 and in the United States a year later. The <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> approved for once-daily use for ED in Europe in June2007 and in the United States in January2008.|$|E
5|$|An {{epidemic}} of dysentery broke {{out on the}} Kokoda Track that threatened the entire force. Some 1,200 casualties, mostly dysentery, reached Ilolo in September. Simple hygiene procedures involving the disposal of rubbish and excrement were required, but were neglected {{in the early stages}} of the campaign. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford arranged for supplies of a new drug, sulphaguanidine, to be shipped from Australia. The widespread use of a scarce <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> a gamble, as it used up all the stocks in Australia, but one that paid off; it arrested the epidemic, and allowed sick men to travel, thereby saving lives. When the Australians advanced on Kokoda in October, special details constructed latrines, buried the dead, and, in extreme cases, burned villages that the Japanese had fouled beyond redemption.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the summer}} of 2009 and March 2010, the use of {{mephedrone}} grew rapidly in the UK, with it becoming readily available at music festivals, head shops and on the internet. A survey of Mixmag readers in 2009, found {{it was the fourth}} most popular street drug in the United Kingdom, behind cannabis, cocaine, and ecstasy. The <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> used by a diverse range of social groups. Whilst the evidence was anecdotal, researchers, charity workers, teachers and users reported widespread and increasing use of the drug in 2009. The drug's rapid growth in popularity was believed to be related to both its availability and legality.|$|E

50|$|Street <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> {{commonly}} abused <b>drugs</b> that <b>are</b> bought illegally {{and have}} many nicknames. Examples of street <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> heroin, marijuana and its psychoactive ingredient of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and cocaine.|$|R
5|$|Fairley tackled an {{outbreak}} of bacilliary dysentery among the troops in Egypt. In most cases the patients recovered {{of their own accord}} but some cases of shigellosis became seriously ill and died. Fairley had some Shiga anti-toxin with him, but it proved ineffective in serious cases, even when administered in large doses. However, he also had an experimental supply of sulphaguanidine that had been given to him by Dr E. K. Marshall of Johns Hopkins Hospital. The <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> administered to a patient with severe shigellosis who was not expected to live, and the patient soon recovered. Of the 21,015 Australian soldiers who contracted bacilliary dysentery during the Second World War, only 21 died.|$|E
5|$|However, Sterling Products did not market Panadol in the United States {{or other}} {{countries}} where Bayer Aspirin still dominated the aspirin market. Other firms began selling acetaminophen drugs, most significantly, McNeil Laboratories with liquid Tylenol in 1955, and Tylenol pills in 1958. By 1967, Tylenol was available without a prescription. Because {{it did not}} cause gastric irritation, acetaminophen rapidly displaced much of aspirin's sales. Another analgesic, anti-inflammatory <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> introduced in 1962: ibuprofen (sold as Brufen in the U.K. and Motrin in the U.S.). By the 1970s, aspirin had a relatively {{small portion of the}} pain reliever market, and in the 1980s sales decreased even more when ibuprofen became available without prescription.|$|E
5|$|Icos {{is famous}} for tadalafil (Cialis), a drug used to treat erectile dysfunction. This <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered}} by GlaxoSmithKline, developed by Icos, and manufactured and marketed in partnership with Eli Lilly. Boosted by a unique advertising campaign led by the Grey Worldwide Agency, sales from Cialis allowed Icos to become profitable in 2006. Cialis was the only drug developed by the company to be approved. LeukArrest, a drug to treat shock, and Pafase, developed for sepsis, were both tested in phaseIII clinical trials, but testing was discontinued after unpromising results during the trials. Eli Lilly acquired Icos in January 2007, and most of Icos's workers were laid off soon after. CMC Biologics, a Danish contract manufacturer, bought the remnants of Icos and retained the remaining employees.|$|E
30|$|Introduction: Use {{of generic}} <b>drugs,</b> which <b>are</b> bioequivalent to brand-name <b>drugs,</b> <b>is</b> now a common practice. However, {{there is still}} concern among {{patients}} and physicians that brand-name <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> more efficient than generic drugs (1).|$|R

5|$|In 2010 fingolimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate {{receptor}} modulator, {{became the}} first oral drug approved by the FDA, being followed in 2012 by teriflunomide, a drug that inhibits the synthesis of pyrimidine and disrupts the interaction of T cells with antigen presenting cell. Fingolimod and teriflunomide are taken through a daily single dose. In 2013 one further oral drug, dimethyl fumarate -or BG12- (which is an improved version of fumaric acid, an already existing <b>drug),</b> <b>was</b> approved by the FDA. Dimethyl fumarate is taken twice daily.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, an Italian {{research}} company, Farmitalia Research Laboratories, {{began an}} organized {{effort to find}} anticancer compounds from soil-based microbes. A soil sample was isolated from the area surrounding the Castel del Monte, a 13th-century castle. A new strain of Streptomyces peucetius, which produced a red pigment, was isolated, and an antibiotic from this bacterium was effective against tumors in mice. Since a group of French researchers discovered the same compound {{at about the same}} time, the two teams named the compound daunorubicin, combining the name Dauni, a pre-Roman tribe that occupied the area of Italy where the compound was isolated, with the French word for ruby, rubis, describing the color. Clinical trials began in the 1960s, and the <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> successful in treating acute leukemia and lymphoma. However, by 1967, it was recognized that daunorubicin could produce fatal cardiac toxicity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration noted the <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> being used recreationally in California. It also {{reported}} that BZP was being used as an adulterant in illicit drugs. Not long after, {{there was an explosion}} in the drug's use worldwide – a situation which was soon followed by legislative control in many countries. Since 1999, benzylpiperazine use grew sharply in New Zealand due to an initial complete lack of regulation. The New Zealand government attempted to ban the product as of 18 December 2007, but the necessary second reading of the bill did not happen in time for the law to be passed. It was so widely used that an estimated 5 million pills were sold in New Zealand in 2007.|$|E
50|$|Preventive <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> used {{to reduce}} the frequency, duration, and {{severity}} of migraine attacks. Because of frequent unpleasant and sometimes debilitating side effects, preventive <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> only prescribed for those migraineurs whose {{quality of life is}} significantly adversely affected. The most commonly prescribed drugs for migraine prevention are beta-blockers, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants. The <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> started at a low dose, which is gradually increased until therapeutic effects develop, the ceiling dose for the chosen <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> reached, or side effects become intolerable.|$|R
5000|$|Club drugs, {{also called}} rave drugs, or party <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> a loosely defined {{category}} of recreational <b>drugs</b> which <b>are</b> associated with discothèques in the 1970s and nightclubs, dance clubs, electronic dance music parties, and raves in the 1980s to the 2010s. Unlike many other categories, such as opiates, which are established according to pharmaceutical or chemical properties, club <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> a [...] "category of convenience", in which <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> included {{due to the}} locations they are consumed and/or where the user goes while {{under the influence of}} the <b>drugs.</b> Club <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> generally used by teens and young adults. This group of <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> also called [...] "designer drugs", as most are synthesized in chemical lab (e.g., MDMA, ketamine, LSD) rather than being sourced from plants (as with marijuana, which comes from the cannabis plant).|$|R
50|$|Not all club <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> {{addictive}} (e.g. nitrous oxide). However, some club <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> addictive. Amphetamine heavily used in recreational fashion pose {{a serious}} risk of addiction.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the 40 Watt Club became a {{well-known}} regional attraction for music fans, and {{was followed by}} the Uptown Lounge; with the local industry's growth in the 1980s, both the 40 Watt Club and the Uptown Lounge moved to larger spaces, the latter taking over the landmark Georgia Theatre. The early 1980s saw a host of new bands and venues appear, while the city's musical subculture became more diversified. LSD, a hallucinogenic <b>drug,</b> <b>was</b> widely used in the college music scene in this era. Many members of Athens's most prominent later bands became locally renowned starting in the 1970s, including The B-52's.|$|E
5|$|Several anti-angiogenesis drugs {{approved}} for other conditions, such as cancer, {{have been investigated}} in small clinical trials. The anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab, for instance, has been used off-label in several studies. In the largest study conducted so far, bevacizumab infusion {{was associated with a}} decrease in cardiac output and reduced duration and number of episodes of epistaxis in treated HHT patients. Thalidomide, another anti-angiogenesis <b>drug,</b> <b>was</b> also reported to have beneficial effects in HHT patients. Thalidomide treatment was found to induce vessel maturation in an experimental mouse model of HHT and to reduce the severity and frequency of nosebleeds in the majority {{of a small group of}} HHT patients. The blood hemoglobin levels of these treated patients rose as a result of reduced hemorrhage and enhanced blood vessel stabilization.|$|E
5|$|The {{biodegradation}} of methoxyflurane produces {{inorganic fluoride}} and dichloroacetic acid (DCAA). The combined {{effects of these}} two compounds {{may be responsible for}} the toxicity of methoxyflurane to some of the major organs of the human body. Methoxyflurane was determined to be nephrotoxic (damaging to the kidneys) in a dose-dependent response and hepatotoxic (damaging to the liver) at anesthetic doses in 1973, and the <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> abandoned as a general anesthetic in the late 1970s. In 1999, the manufacturer discontinued distribution of methoxyflurane in the United States and Canada, and on September 6, 2005, the Food and Drug Administration determined that it should be withdrawn from the market for safety concerns. It is however still used in Australia as an emergency analgesic for the initial management of pain due to acute trauma, as well as for brief painful procedures such as changing of wound dressings or for transport of injured people.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Drug</b> {{harmfulness}} <b>is</b> {{the degree}} to which a psychoactive <b>drug</b> <b>is</b> harmful to a user and is measured in various ways, such as by addictiveness and the potential for physical harm. More harmful <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> called [...] "hard drugs" [...] and less harmful <b>drugs</b> <b>are</b> called [...] "soft drugs". The term [...] "soft drug" [...] is considered controversial by its critics as it may imply that soft drugs cause no or insignificant harm.|$|R

5|$|The {{legal status}} of {{psilocybin}} mushrooms varies worldwide. Psilocybin and psilocin are listed as Class A (United Kingdom) or Schedule I (US) drugs under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The possession and use of psilocybin mushrooms, including P.semilanceata, is therefore prohibited by extension. Although many European countries remained open to the use and possession of hallucinogenic mushrooms after the US ban, starting in the 2000s (decade) {{there has been a}} tightening of laws and enforcements. In The Netherlands, where the <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> once routinely sold in licensed cannabis coffee shops and smart shops, laws were instituted in October 2008 to prohibit the possession or sale of psychedelic mushrooms—the final European country to do so.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{psilocybin}} are highly variable and {{depend on the}} mindset and {{environment in which the}} user has the experience, factors commonly referred to as set and setting. In the early 1960s, Timothy Leary and colleagues at Harvard University investigated the role of set and setting on the effects of psilocybin. They administered the drug to 175 volunteers from various backgrounds in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room. Ninety-eight of the subjects were given questionnaires to assess their experiences and the contribution of background and situational factors. Individuals who had experience with psilocybin prior to the study reported more pleasant experiences than those for whom the <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> novel. Group size, dosage, preparation, and expectancy were important determinants of the drug response. In general, those placed in groups of more than eight individuals felt that the groups were less supportive, and their experiences were less pleasant. Conversely, smaller groups (fewer than six individuals) were seen as more supportive. Participants also reported having more positive reactions to the drug in those groups. Leary and colleagues proposed that psilocybin heightens suggestibility, making an individual more receptive to interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli. These findings were affirmed in a later review by Jos ten Berge (1999), who concluded that dosage, set, and setting were fundamental factors in determining the outcome of experiments that tested the effects of psychedelic drugs on artists' creativity.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of aspirin's analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties was unknown through the drug's heyday in the early- to mid-twentieth century; Heinrich Dreser's explanation, widely accepted since the <b>drug</b> <b>was</b> first brought to market, was that aspirin relieved pain by {{acting on the}} central nervous system. In 1958 Harry Collier, a biochemist in the London laboratory of pharmaceutical company Parke Davis, began investigating the relationship between kinins {{and the effects of}} aspirin. In tests on guinea pigs, Collier found that aspirin, if given beforehand, inhibited the bronchoconstriction effects of bradykinin. He found that cutting the guinea pigs' vagus nerve did not affect the action of bradykinin or the inhibitory effect of aspirin—evidence that aspirin worked locally to combat pain and inflammation, rather than on the central nervous system. In 1963, Collier began working with University of London pharmacology graduate student Priscilla Piper to determine the precise {{mechanism of}} aspirin's effects. However, it was difficult to pin down the precise biochemical goings-on in live research animals, and in vitro tests on removed animal tissues did not behave like in vivo tests.|$|E
