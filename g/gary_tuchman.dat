5000|$|After {{compiling}} {{a list of}} abusive clergy {{who have never been}} subject to church censure or discipline, Massi alleged that the church government system of Baptist Fundamentalism permits its clergy to abuse children by granting them positional immunity. She has asserted that fundamentalists have refused to expel abusive pastors, including those convicted of sex offenses. In 2005, Massi produced a five-part audio documentary, The Lambs of Culpeper, and released it onto the Internet for free download. The documentary addresses alleged abuses against children at Calvary Baptist Church of Culpeper, Virginia, a church then pastored by Charles Shifflett. In 2007, Massi founded the Conference of the Lambs, a two-day conference designed to assist adults who had been molested as children in Fundamentalist churches. In 2008 Massi self-published Schizophrenic Christianity, which denounced corruption within Christian Fundamentalism that had resulted in harm, especially to children. In 2009, Massi conducted interviews of former residents of Hephzibah House in Warsaw, Indiana, a Christian Fundamentalist Children's home for girls. She then produced The Lambs of Hephzibah House, an audio documentary that alleges severe abuse of residents at Hephzibah House. In 2011, <b>Gary</b> <b>Tuchman,</b> a CNN journalist reporting for Anderson Cooper 360, interviewed many of the same former residents and produced an episode about Hephzibah House on CNN's [...] "Ungodly Discipline" [...] series.|$|E
