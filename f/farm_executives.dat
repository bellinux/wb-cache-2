40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to present an {{agricultural}} supply model for Scotland used to estimate regional changes in agricultural outputs due to the 2003 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform. Supply functions were estimated for several farm types based on generalised trans-logarithmic multiproduct cost functions (Caves, Christensen and Tretheway, 1981). The data used for the estimation were an unbalanced panel dataset constructed using farm level data from the Scottish <b>Executive’s</b> <b>Farm</b> Accounts Scheme (FAS) survey.

40|$|Two field {{experiments}} with Sunflower on deep cracking soil with heavy clay (vertisol) were conducted at Gezira Research Station <b>Farm</b> during two <b>executive</b> winter seasons, in WadMedani, Sudan. The crop was sown {{in the third}} week of November and {{in the first week of}} December for seasons 2012 and 2013 respectively. The experimental design was split plot design with three replicates. The Sunflower hybrid tested in the study was Hysun 33. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of three different irrigation intervals of 10, 15 and 20 days and two intra-row plant spacings of 30 cm and 40 cm on yield and yield components of Sunflower. The seed yields obtained from the different treatments were in the ranges of 1890 - 3300 kg/ha and 1590 - 3290 kg/ha for the first and second season respectively. The corresponding computed on average crop water productivity was in the range of 0. 31 - 0. 43 kg/m 3. The study clearly indicated that the highest seed yield was obtained when the crop was sown at 40 cm plant spacing and irrigated every 10 days. The highest crop water productivity was achieved from irrigation every 15 days in both planting spacing...|$|R
