40|$|We have {{estimated}} the capacity and affinity of insulin-mediated glucose uptake (IMGU) in whole body and in leg muscle of obese non-insulin-dependent diabetics (NIDDM, n = 6) with severe hyperglycemia, glycohemoglobin (GHb 14. 4 +/- 1. 2 %), lean controls (ln, n = 7) and obese nondiabetic controls (ob, n = 7). Mean +/- SEM weight (kg) was 67 +/- 2 (ln), 100 +/- 7 (ob), and 114 +/- 11 (NIDDM), P = NS between obese groups. NIDDM were also studied after 3 wk of intensive insulin therapy, GHb post therapy was 10. 1 +/- 0. 9, P less than 0. 01 vs. pretherapy. Insulin (120 mu/m 2 per min) was infused and the arterial blood glucose (G) sequentially maintained at approximately 4, 7, 12, and 21 mmol/liter utilizing the <b>G</b> <b>clamp</b> technique. Leg glucose uptake (LGU) was calculated {{as the product}} of the femoral arteriovenous glucose difference (FAVGd) and leg blood flow measured by thermodilution. Compared to ln, ob and NIDDM had significantly lower rates of whole body IMGU and LGU at all G levels. Compared to ob, the NIDDM exhibited approximately 50 % and approximately 40 % lower rates of whole body IMGU over the first two G levels (P less than 0. 02) but did not differ at the highest G, P = NS. LGU was 83 % lower in NIDDM vs. ob, P less than 0. 05 at the first G level only. After insulin therapy NIDDM were indistinguishable from ob with respect to whole body IMGU or LGU at all G levels. A significant correlation was noted between the percent GHb and the EG 50 (G at which 1 / 2 maximal FAVGd occurs) r = 0. 73, P less than 0. 05. Thus, (a) insulin resistance in NIDDM and obese subjects are characterized by similar decreases in capacity for skeletal muscle IMGU, but differs in that poorly controlled NIDDM display a decrease in affinity for skeletal muscle IMGU, and (b) this affinity defect is related to the degree of antecedent glycemic control and is reversible with insulin therapy, suggesting that it is an acquired defect...|$|E

For building small boats under 5m some specialized tools are needed such as <b>clamps</b> (cramps) either <b>G</b> <b>clamps</b> or spring clamps. A minimum of 4 6inch(150mm) and 10 4inch(100mm) <b>G</b> <b>clamps,</b> plus 20 2 inch(50mm) steel spring clamps is need for ply on frame designs. More is better with clamps. Flat and round surform rasps are useful tools for shaping wood and ply. A drill set from 2-10mm, several speedbore drills for larger holes 12-25mm, (1/2inch-1 inch) rotary sanding backing pads {{and a range of}} replacement sanding pads from coarse (40grit) to fine (180grit), counter sinking drills for screws, a right angle set square, a set of manual screw drivers with blades to match screws being used are essential. A heavy craft knife, an 8m(25 ft) tape, flat and round files for metal and wood, a short(torpedo) level and a set of 3 chisels from 6 to 25mm are needed. Power tools make a job much easier and are relatively cheap. An 7 1/4inch (185mm) circular saw with a fine 40 tooth tungsten carbide blade, a jigsaw with a dust blower with a set of fine, medium and coarse tooth metal and wood blades is good for cutting plywood panels to shape, a rotary oscillating sander with medium and fine pads and a cordless drill for driving screws all save time and energy. A steam box is excellent for making planks easier to bend although hot wet rags are a messy, but easy substitute. A fine tooth hacksaw is not only essential for cutting metal such as trimming stainless steel bolts to the correct length but is handy for ultra-fine cuts in thin wood. A fine-tooth tenon saw is used to cut across the grain to produce a reasonably fine, accurate cut. Some boat builders have started using Japanese draw saws for fine cuts but while these are excellent they tend to be very expensive. A No 4 smoothing plane is essential but an electric plane is very useful (but extremely loud) for making rudder blades and centre boards. A much longer No. 7 plane is needed if the design calls for a wooden spars as used in many modern [...] "traditional" [...] yachts.|$|R

The complete model has 10 degree-of-freedom (DOF) and includes essential nonlinearities such as gear backlashes, Coulomb frictions, and disk gap clearance. Such a full model is reduced to 6 degree-of-freedom model in SIMULINK for simulation study of the effectiveness and the achievable performance of different hardware and controller designs, an invaluable tool in the early design stage of a product. Simulation {{results show that the}} model is able to reproduce various nonlinear characteristics including typical structural hysteresis as shown in real brake assembly. The linearized version of the full nonlinear model is then obtained for its modal properties to understand the modes that are critical to the low frequency dynamics of the overall system. The results of the modal analyses are subsequently utilized to obtain two simplified models, one for non-contact mode and the other for the contact mode of operation. The concepts of two simplified models well capture the dynamic characteristics of the system over the frequencies of interest and are being used in the controller (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>clamping</b> force control) and estimator (e. g., gap clearance estimation) designs that are under investigation. 1...|$|R

For {{the analysis of}} ion channel-modulating compounds, one variant of the patch-clamp technique, the whole-cell configuration, is particularly useful. We present here patch-clamp recordings in the whole-cell configuration and single channel recordings performed with planar patch-clamp chips, which are microstructured from borosilicate glass substrate. The chips {{are used in the}} Port-a-Patch©, an ion channel research/screening instrument that enables automated patch-clamp experiments on a single cell. A software runs the experiment by executing user-determined protocols for cell positioning, as well as for electrical stimulation and current readout. In various electrophysiological experiments, the high quality of recordings and the versatility of the perfusion of the recorded cells are demonstrated. Quantitative pharmacological experiments are performed on sodium channels expressed in HEK cells using solution volumes in the low microliter range. The exceptionally low volume consumption in the experiments make the system attractive for work on rare or expensive compounds. Due to the low volumes necessary, a rapid solution exchange is facilitated, which is shown on RBL cells. The patch-clamp chip enables a rapid and precise perfusion, allowing sophisticated investigations on ion channel function with the Port-a-Patch. 66...|$|R

The goal {{of this research is}} to develop a novel device to study the initial decomposition processes. For this, a novel wire-mesh reactor was constructed. A small sample (< 0. 1 <b>g)</b> was <b>clamped</b> between two meshes that were heated fast (up to 10 000 °C/s, ΔTmesh ± 35 °C) by an electrical current. The mesh/feedstock was placed inside a vacumized (P < 0. 3 mbar), liquid nitrogen cooled vessel (Twall < − 80 °C). These two last features were proven to result in a low vapour life time (< 15 – 25 ms versus ∼ 2 s in typical pyrolysis). The vapour residence time and temperature could be increased by increasing the pressure inside the reactor and by removing of the liquid nitrogen cooling. Reproducible results concerning yields (mass balance closures 90 – 110 wt%) and analysis were obtained (oil by SEC and NMR, gas by GC, char by FTIR). The yields and oil composition were changing with loading from 0. 05 g to 0. 1 g, despite the small sample amounts. Compared to more “conventional” pyrolysis processes, high oil yields (84 wt%), very low char yields (5 wt%) and low gas yields (8 wt%) were obtained. Using a high speed camera, movies were made and together with accompanying pressure profiles, it was possible to estimate the conversion rate. At 500 °C the conversion process was finished within 0. 8 s which is faster than previously reported in the literature. Especially an increase in gas yield (+ 14 wt%, mainly CO) was observed in absence of cooling (Pvac/No Cooling), while both the gas (+ 4 wt%) and char yield (+ 3 wt%) increased under atmospheric pressure (Patm/Cooling), all at the expense of oil yield.

Ritonavir reduced serum leptin levels in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice but had no effect on serum adiponectin. No change in these adipokines was observed following ritonavir treatment of G 4 KO mice.

Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT, 100 <b>g)</b> and hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic <b>clamp</b> were performed throughout the study. Plasma concentrations of insulin and glucose were determined by radioimmunoassay and glucose oxidase technique, respectively. Five of 13 PCOS patients developed gestational diabetes (GD) at the third trimester (PCOS-GD), while the other eight patients did not develop any alteration of glucose metabolism (PCOS-nGD). Both fasting glucose and insulin plasma concentrations did not change significantly during pregnancy and no difference was seen between the two groups. On the contrary PCOS-GD group early exhibited higher values of area under the curve (AUC) for glucose and insulin response to OGTT with respect to those found in PCOS-nGD group. This difference was already significant in the first gestational trimester. Moreover insulin sensitivity value (M) was significantly lower in the first trimester of gestation in PCOS-GD as compared with that found in PCOS-nGD group. However, as gestation proceeded, M value decreased in PCOS-nDG group and the difference from PCOS patients developing gestational diabetes was not sustained into the second and third trimesters. Both groups had similar body mass index values and AUC insulin increase from first to third trimester of gestation. It is concluded that early alteration of insulin sensitivity and secretion constitute specific risk factors in PCOS patients for the development of abnormalities of glucose tolerance...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: A {{simulation}} {{model of a}} glucose–insulin system accounting for physical activity is needed to reliably simulate normal life conditions, thus accelerating {{the development of an}} artificial pancreas. In fact, exercise causes a transient increase of insulin action and may lead to hypoglycemia. However, physical activity is difficult to model. In the past, it was described indirectly as a rise in insulin. Recently, a new parsimonious model of exercise effect on glucose homeostasis has been proposed that links the change in insulin action and glucose effectiveness to heart rate (HR). The aim {{of this study was to}} plug this exercise model into our recently proposed large-scale {{simulation model}} of glucose metabolism in type 1 diabetes to better describe normal life conditions. Methods: The exercise model describes changes in glucose–insulin dynamics in two phases: a rapid on-and-off change in insulin-independent glucose clearance and a rapid-on/slow-off change in insulin sensitivity. Three candidate models of glucose effectiveness and insulin sensitivity as a function of HR have been considered, both during exercise and recovery after exercise. By incorporating these three models into the type 1 diabetes model, we simulated different levels (from mild to moderate) and duration of exercise (15 and 30 minutes), both in steady-state (e. <b>g.,</b> during euglycemic–hyperinsulinemic <b>clamp)</b> and in nonsteady state (e. g., after a meal) conditions. Results: One candidate exercise model was selected as the most reliable. Conclusions: A type 1 diabetes model also describing physical activity is proposed. The model represents a step forward to accurately describe glucose homeostasis in normal life conditions; however, further studies are needed to validate it against dat...|$|R
40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{assessment of}} quantitative indexes of insulin secretion and {{action in a}} single individual is important when quantifying their relative role {{in the evolution of}} glucose tolerance in different physiopathological states. Available methods quantify these indexes in relatively nonphysiological conditions, e. <b>g.,</b> during glucose <b>clamps</b> or intravenous glucose tolerance tests. Here, we present a method based on a physiological test applicable to large-scale genetic and epidemiologic studies-the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Plasma C-peptide, insulin, and glucose data from a frequently sampled OGTT with 22 samples throughout 300 min (FSOGTT 300 - 22) were analyzed in 11 subjects with various degrees of glucose tolerance. In each individual, two indexes of pancreatic sensitivity to glucose (phis [10 (9) min(- 1) ] and phid [10 (9) ]) and the insulin sensitivity index (SI) (10 (5) dl/kg per min per pmol/l) were estimated by using the minimal model of C-peptide secretion and kinetics originally proposed for intravenous graded glucose infusion and the minimal model approach recently proposed for meal/OGTTs. The indexes obtained from FSOGTT 300 - 22 were used as a reference for internal validation of OGTT protocols with reduced sampling schedules. Our results show that 11 samples in a 300 -min period (OGTT 300 - 11) is the test of choice because the indexes it provides (phis = 36 +/- 3 [means +/- SE]; phid = 710 +/- 111; SI = 10. 2 +/- 2. 4) show excellent correlation and are not statistically different from those of FSOGTT 300 - 22 (phis = 33 +/- 3; phid = 715 +/- 120; SI = 10. 1 +/- 2. 3). In conclusion, OGTT 300 - 11, interpreted with C-peptide and glucose minimal models, provides a quantitative description of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity in a single individual while preserving the important clinical classification of glucose tolerance provided by the standard 120 -min OGTT...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathophysiological}} {{significance of}} the glucose-fatty acid cycle in skeletal muscle in vivo is uncertain. We have examined the short term effects of increased availability of nonesterified FFA on tissue-specific glucose uptake and storage in rat tissues in vivo basally and during a hyperinsulinemic (150 mU/liter) euglycemic clamp. Circulating FFA were elevated to 2 mmol/liter (FFA 1) or 4 mmol/liter (FFA 2). Elevated FFA produced a dose-dependent inhibition of myocardial glucose utilization in both basal (FFA 1, 42 %; FFA 2, 68 %; P less than 0. 001, by analysis of variance) and clamp groups (FFA 1, 39 %; FFA 2, 49 %; P less than 0. 001) and also suppressed brown adipose tissue glucose utilization during the clamp (- 42 %, P less than 0. 001). In contrast to heart, glucose utilization in skeletal muscle was suppressed by FFA only in the FFA 1 basal group (- 36 %, P less than 0. 001); in other groups (e. <b>g.,</b> FFA 2 <b>clamp)</b> elevated FFA produced increased skeletal muscle glucose utilization (+ 68 %, P less than 0. 001) that was directed toward glycogen (+ 175 %, P less than 0. 05) and lipid deposition (+ 125 %, P less than 0. 005). FFA stimulated basal glucose utilization in white (e. g., FFA 2, + 220 %, P less than 0. 005) and brown adipose tissue (e. g., FFA 2, + 200 %, P less than 0. 005). Thus elevated FFA can acutely inhibit glucose utilization in skeletal muscle in addition to cardiac muscle in vivo supporting a possible role for the glucose-fatty acid cycle in skeletal muscle in acute insulin resistance. However, at high levels or with elevated insulin, FFA stimulates glucose utilization and storage in skeletal muscle. By promoting accumulation of glucose storage products, chronic elevation of FFA may lead to skeletal muscle (and therefore whole body) insulin resistance...|$|R
40|$|This {{experimental}} PhD thesis {{presents the}} results of research performed in five different facilities: in the Laboratory of Bio-inspired Nanomechanics "Giuseppe Maria Pugno" at the Politecnico of Torino, the "Nanofacility Piemonte" at the INRIM Institute in Torino, the Division of Dental Sciences and Biomaterials of the Department of Biomedicine at the University of Trieste, the Physics Department of the Politecnico of Torino, the Toscano- Buono Veterinary Surgery in Torino and the Department of Human and Animal Biology at the University of Torino. The adhesive abilities of insects, spiders and reptiles have inspired researchers for a long time. All these organisms present outstanding performance particularly for force, adhesion and climbing abilities, especially considering their size and weight. Scientists have focused attention on the gecko's adhesive paw system and climbing abilities, and its adhesion mechanism has been an important topic of research for nearly 150 years. However, certain phenomena about geckos are still not completely understood and nowadays these still represent the main challenge of several scientific discussions which aim to better understand the gecko's adhesive ability. This thesis deals first with the influence of surface roughness on the gecko's adhesion on the inverted surface of Poly(methyl meth-acrylate) (PMMA) and glass in Chapter 1, of PMMA with different surface roughness in Chapter 2, while Chapter 3 deals with the gecko's maximum normal adhesive force and Chapter 4 looks at the optimal adhesion angle at different hierarchical levels. The gecko's moult (Appendix 1) is examined in a preliminary way. The Tokay gecko (Gekko gecko) is the most studied gecko among more than 1050 Gekkonid lizard species in the world, due to its strong adhesive ability. Because this thesis reports clear experimental measurements on two living Tokay geckos, it is comparable to scientific results reported in the literature. It is well known how small insects can carry many times their own weight and can walk quickly, but their most interesting ability is their extremely high adhesion. In recent decades, many scientists have studied a number of insects in order to understand and measure their adhesive abilities. Biological adhesion can be obtained through different adhesive mechanisms (e. <b>g.</b> claw, <b>clamp,</b> sucker, glue, friction). In particular, this thesis focuses on living specimens of the non-climbing cockroach (Blatta Orientalis Linnaeus) by evaluating its maximum shear safety factor on artificial surfaces using a centrifuge machine, see Chapter 5. In general, the adhesive structure and mechanism of an animal could be connected to the micro-structured roughness of natural substrata (e. g. plant surfaces), which animals usually find when they move around in the natural environment. In nature, plants show an extraordinary variety of morphologies and surface structures. Some plants possess two special properties; superhydrophobicity (or water-repellency) and self-cleaning (or dirt-freedom). These two related phenomena were observed for the first time by Aristotle more than 2, 000 years ago but {{it was only in the}} 20 th century that scientists examined them accurately on some natural leaves, e. g. the lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) on which "raindrops take a clear, spherical shape without spreading, which probably has to be ascribed to some kind of evaporated essence", as Goethe described in 1817. Accordingly to scientific literature, a strong influence of surface roughness on wettability and self-cleaning behaviour clearly emerges. This well-defined problem was of particular interest (for the Indesit Company) since we wanted to find an industrial solution which would leave the internal sides of refrigerators clean from condensed water or dirt. For this reason, a collaborative project started. Two industrial processes, plasma and thermoforming treatments, were applied to polystyrene surfaces. The Indesit refrigerator box is made of polystyrene. The influence of these industrial treatments on the surface wettability were analysed, see Chapter 6. The focus of the Indesit Company was to understand the role of roughness and to produce a superhydrophobic and self-cleaning surface. Thus, this thesis reports the method which we developed in order to design an artificial biomimetic superhydrophobic polystyrene surface, copying the natural lotus leaf (Chapter 7). In addition, surface roughness implies a modification of the tribological and frictional properties, so it assumes a crucial role when designing two contacting surfaces, in particular at nano-scale (Chapter 8). The nanometer scale characterises this thesis and is involved in everything from gecko spatulae to the waxy nanotubules of the lotus leaf, to the fibroin protein materials which constitute spider silks. In general, spider silks display superior mechanical properties but, only in the last few decades, reserachers have studied various types of silks and have evaluated their very different mechanical properties. The fact that the mechanical behaviour of spider silks varies accordingly to their type is well-known, since silk properties have been demonstrated to be species-specific and are linked to silk-based peptide fibrils or protein aggregates, with different structural and mechanical properties. The dragline silk (or radial silk) and the flag silk (or circumferential silk) of orb weaving spiders have been characterized in scientific literature while, to our knowledge, few studies have been conducted on bundles, which connect the cocoons of Meta menardi to the ceiling of caves. These were tested to determine their mechanical properties in terms of stress, strain and toughness (Chapter 9...|$|R
