Although Picard offers himself in Data's place, the android refuses to leave.

5|$|Nevinson {{obtained}} a commission from the Royal Air Force to portray airmen {{preparing for the}} Dieppe raid in August 1942 and they also allowed him to fly in their planes to develop pictures of the air war.

5|$|The {{unfinished}} {{painting was}} exhibited in Whitechapel in 1886, under the intentionally simplified title of The Sun. Watts {{worked on the}} painting for a further five years, and the completed version was exhibited {{for the first time}} at the New Gallery in 1891. Between 1902 and 1906 the painting was exhibited around the United Kingdom, and it is now in the collection of the Watts Gallery in Compton, Surrey. As Watts did not include After the Deluge in his <b>gift</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nation of what he considered his most significant works, it is not among his better-known paintings. However, it was greatly admired by many of Watts's fellow artists, and has been cited as an influence on numerous other painters who worked in the two decades following its initial exhibition.|$|E

On January 10, 1976, Tydings announced his candidacy to retake the seat, which he argued was taken unfairly in 1970 due to an undisclosed $180,000 <b>gift</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Beall campaign.|$|E
5|$|After Selvo was deposed, it {{took several}} years for Venice {{to recover from the}} defeat at Corfu and for the Venetians to fully realize the {{immediate}} impact of his actions as Doge. When Venice provided military aid to the Byzantine Empire, they were awarded a Golden Bull by Emperor Alexios I that would provide the Venetians a great economic and strategic advantage throughout the eastern empire for centuries. According to the terms of the decree, annual grants were awarded to all the churches in Venice (including a special <b>gift</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coffers of St Mark's), the Republic was granted whole sections of the Golden Horn in Constantinople, and Venetian merchants were given a full exemption from all taxes and duties throughout the territories of the Byzantine Empire. Not only did this aid the rapid economic growth of Venice in the next few centuries by giving Venetian goods a significant price advantage over other foreign goods, but it initiated a long period of artistic, cultural, and military relationships between Venice and Byzantium. This combination of eastern and western cultural influences made Venice a symbolic gateway between the east and the west in Southern Europe.|$|E
