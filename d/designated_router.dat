25|$|This logical {{addressing}} structure {{permits the}} selective routing of IP packets across multiple networks via special gateway computers, called routers, to a destination host if the network prefixes of origination and destination hosts differ, or sent {{directly to a}} target host on the local network if they are the same. Routers constitute logical or physical borders between the subnets, and manage traffic between them. Each subnet is served by a <b>designated</b> default <b>router,</b> but may consist internally of multiple physical Ethernet segments interconnected by network switches or network bridges.|$|R
2500|$|... 2-Way: The 2-Way state {{indicates}} {{the establishment of}} a bidirectional conversation between two routers. This state immediately precedes {{the establishment of a}}djacency. This is the lowest state of a router that may be considered as a <b>Designated</b> <b>Router.</b>|$|E
2500|$|OSPF {{supports}} complex networks {{with multiple}} routers, including backup routers, to balance traffic load on multiple {{links to other}} subnets. Neighboring routers in the same broadcast domain or {{at each end of}} a point-to-point telecommunications communicate with each other via the OSPF protocol. Routers form adjacencies when they have detected each other. This detection is initiated when a router identifies itself in a Hello protocol packet. Upon acknowledgment, this establishes a two-way state and the most basic relationship. The routers in an Ethernet or Frame Relay network select a <b>Designated</b> <b>Router</b> (DR) and a Backup <b>Designated</b> <b>Router</b> (BDR) which act as a hub to reduce traffic between routers. OSPF uses both unicast and multicast transmission modes to send [...] "Hello" [...] packets and link state updates.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} specifies {{an extension}} of OSPFv 3 to support mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The extension, called OSPF-MDR, is designed as a new OSPF interface type for MANETs. OSPF-MDR {{is based on the}} selection of a subset of MANET routers, consisting of MANET <b>Designated</b> <b>Routers</b> (MDRs) and Backup MDRs. The MDRs form a connected dominating set (CDS), and the MDRs and Backup MDRs together form a biconnected CDS for robustness. This CDS is exploited in two ways. First, to reduce flooding overhead, an optimized flooding procedure is used in which only (Backup) MDRs flood new link state advertisements (LSAs) back out the receiving interface; reliable flooding is ensured by retransmitting LSAs along adjacencies. Second, adjacencies are formed only between (Backup) MDRs and a subset of their neighbors, allowing for much better scaling in dense networks. The CDS is constructed using 2 -hop neighbor information provided in a Hello protocol extension. The Hello protocol is further optimized by allowing differential Hellos that report only changes in neighbor states. Options are specified for originating router-LSAs that provide full or partial topology information, allowing overhead to be reduced by advertising less topology information.

25|$|OSPF {{does not}} use a {{transport}} protocol, such as UDP or TCP, but encapsulates its data directly in IP packets with protocol number 89. This {{is in contrast to}} other routing protocols, such as the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) and the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). OSPF implements its own transport layer error detection and correction functions. OSPF uses multicast addressing for distributing route information within a broadcast domain. OSPF reserves the multicast addresses 224.0.0.5 (IPv4) and FF02::5 (IPv6) for all SPF/link state routers (AllSPFRouters) and 224.0.0.6 (IPv4) and FF02::6 (IPv6) for all <b>Designated</b> <b>Routers</b> (AllDRouters). For non-broadcast networks, special provisions for configuration facilitate neighbor discovery. OSPF multicast IP packets never traverse IP routers, they never travel more than one hop. The virtual link feature can be used to create an adjacency tunnel across multiple hops. The OSPF protocols gathers information regarding all link states in the domain in its link state database, and is thus not a link layer protocol itself, but is – based on the purpose of the protocol; to exchange and calculate optimal paths through the network for IP destination addresses – most correctly classified as an Internet layer protocol. The OSPF protocol, when running on IPv4, can operate securely between routers, optionally using a variety of authentication methods to allow only trusted routers to participate in routing. OSPFv3, running on IPv6, does not support protocol-internal authentication. Instead, it relies on IPv6 protocol security (IPsec).|$|R
50|$|In OSPF, {{areas are}} {{delineated}} {{on the interface}} such that an area border router (ABR) is actually in two or more areas at once, effectively creating the borders between areas inside the ABR, whereas in IS-IS area borders are in between <b>routers,</b> <b>designated</b> as Level 2 or Level 1-2. The result is that an IS-IS router is only ever {{a part of a}} single area.|$|R
2500|$|As a {{link state}} routing protocol, OSPF {{establishes}} and maintains neighbor relationships for exchanging routing updates with other routers. The neighbor relationship table is called an adjacency database. Two OSPF routers are neighbors {{if they are}} members of the same subnet and share the same area ID, subnet mask, timers and authentication. In essence, OSPF neighborship is a relationship between two routers that allow them to see and understand each other but nothing more. OSPF neighbors do not exchange any routing information – the only packets they exchange are Hello packets. [...] OSPF adjacencies are formed between selected neighbors and allow them to exchange routing information. Two routers must first be neighbors and only then, can they become adjacent. Two routers become adjacent if {{at least one of them}} is <b>Designated</b> <b>Router</b> or Backup <b>Designated</b> <b>Router</b> (on multiaccess type networks), or they are interconnected by a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint network type. For forming a neighbor relationship between, the interfaces used to form the relationship must be in the same OSPF area. While an interface may be configured to belong to multiple areas, this is generally not practiced. When configured in a second area, an interface must be configured as a secondary interface.|$|E

30|$|According to the {{cascading}} failure model {{described in}} Section  3, the iterations between Stages 2 and 3 reflect {{the effect of}} the interdependence relations on the failures in CPPS. Thus, studying mitigation strategies for cascading failures is critical. The strategies proposed in this paper are to be implemented at both layers in the CPPS. In the cyber layer, making the nodes autonomous requires them to be equipped with backup power sources (UPS). This means that the bidirectional interdependencies with the corresponding physical nodes are transformed into unidirectional 3 C-function interdependencies. The FACTS technology can effectively improve the operational conditions for a steady and transient states of power systems, and the mitigation control strategies can effectively relieve the overloads, increase the power-transfer capability, and keep power flowing through the <b>designated</b> <b>routers.</b> Thus, FACTS are embedded in the physical layer, and can be classified into three types: shunt, series, and unified controllers. The shunt controller controls the voltage of the node within a certain range. The series and unified controllers control the active and reactive powers on the transmission line by adjusting the transmission line impedance and injected power of the node. Considering the versatility and multi-controlled variables, as the transmission line impedance and injected node power of the unified power flow controller (UPFC), the UPFC represents FACTS. In addition, the requirement on the computational time for mitigation control is limited, and this paper discusses the application of UPFC for mitigating cascading failures in a DC optimal power flow environment. The control variables include the impedance of the transmission line embedded with the UPFC and the injected active power of the nodes at the two ends of the transmission line.|$|R

50|$|Link-state routing {{protocols}} such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and IS-IS elect a <b>designated</b> <b>router</b> on every link to perform flooding of topology information. In wireless ad hoc networks, there is different {{notion of a}} link, packets can and do go out the same interface; hence, a different approach is {{needed in order to}} optimize the flooding process. Using Hello messages the OLSR protocol at each node discovers 2-hop neighbor information and performs a distributed election of a set of multipoint relays (MPRs). Nodes select MPRs such that there exists a path to each of its 2-hop neighbors via a node selected as an MPR. These MPR nodes then source and forward TC messages that contain the MPR selectors. This functioning of MPRs makes OLSR unique from other link state {{routing protocols}} in a few different ways: The forwarding path for TC messages is not shared among all nodes but varies depending on the source, only a subset of nodes source link state information, not all links of a node are advertised but only those that represent MPR selections.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to provide a}} routing {{solution}} for a large scale tactical interdomain network containing multiple Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) and fixed networks. The solution proposed in this thesis involved using Open Shortest Path First – MANET <b>Designated</b> <b>Router</b> (OSPF-MDR); which is a modification of OSPFv 3 to support MANETs as well as OSPFv 3 in the fixed networks. A border gateway routing protocol which actualizes wireless mobility features and routing abilities similar to the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), named BGP – MANET Routing (BGP-MR), was also proposed. BGP-MR introduces the dynamic election of gateways and recursive purging of routes from the BGP table as BGP peers are lost due to mobility. The proposed solution is tested to show OSPF’s ability to provide convergence in large scale networks. Our results showed that after 20 minutes networks running either OSPF or OSPF-MDR converged. Also, our results demonstrate BGP-MR’s ability to provide seamless routing as well as reduced overhead when compared to running BGP in interconnecting MANETs, regardless of their partitioning and merging characteristics. ii Acknowledgement...|$|E

Serving as the Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM) <b>designated</b> <b>router</b> (DR), the LMA 1 will firstly encapsulate the multicast packets and forward the data to the virtual interface with encapsulation target rendezvous point (RP) (G), which is the SR case. After receiving the SR packets, the RP will decapsulate and natively forward the packets down the RP-based distribution tree towards the receivers and also initiate a source-specific join for creating a SPT to the mobile source MN 1 (S) and issue a source register stop at the native arrival of data from S. Since the LMA 1 is the topological anchor point of the mobile source MN 1 in the PMIPv 6 network, the (S, G) tree will proceed from the RP via the LMA 1 and then the LMA 1 -MAG 1 tunnel to the mobile source, which is the SPT case. In response to an exceeded threshold of packet transmission, the DRs of receivers will initiate a source-specific join for creating a SPT to the mobile source S, thereby the (S,G) tree will proceed from the receiving DR via the LMA 1 and then the LMA 1 -MAG 1 tunnel to the mobile source, which is the source-specific multicast (SSM) case.|$|E
