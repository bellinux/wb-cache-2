5|$|According to {{the scholar}} István Boná, Thurisind's {{rise to power}} is a typical example of the {{conflicts}} among the leading families for the kingship that plagued Gepidia in the 6th century and {{made it difficult to}} maintain the succession within the king's family. To contain these obstacles Thurisind made Turismod, his oldest son, commander of the Gepid forces in Sirmium, an important position that made Turismod the king's heir apparent (in early Germanic custom the eldest son was not necessarily the <b>first</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> of succession). After Turismod died, his younger brother Cunimund became commander in Sirmium and thus heir apparent.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Henry, however, the {{political}} situation in England became less stable, with both Stephen of England and the Empress Matilda laying claim to the throne. Brien had originally been considered a supporter of Stephen, but in 1139 Matilda travelled to England and Brien announced his allegiance to her, joining forces with Miles of Gloucester and other supporters in the south-west. Wallingford Castle was now the most easterly stronghold of the Empress's faction – it was either the closest base to London, or the <b>first</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> to be attacked by Stephen's forces, depending on one's perspective.|$|E

5|$|The Southern Rhodesian {{government}} {{found it}} bizarre that Britain was making independent states out of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, less developed territories with little experience of self-rule, while withholding sovereign statehood from Southern Rhodesia, the Federation's senior partner, {{which had already}} been self-governing for four decades and {{which was one of}} the most prosperous and developed countries in Africa. The principle of majority rule, the basis for this apparent inconsistency, was considered irrelevant by the Southern Rhodesians. They had presumed that in the event of Federal dissolution they would be <b>first</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> for independence without major adjustments to the 1961 constitution, an impression confirmed to them by prior intergovernmental correspondence, particularly the oral promises they claimed to have received from Butler. When it did not prove forthcoming they felt cheated. Salisbury contended that its predominantly white legislature was more deserving of independence than the untried black nationalist leaders as it had proven its competence over decades of self-rule.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Rhodesians {{presumed that}} {{in the event of}} Federal dissolution, they would be <b>first</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> for independence, and would receive it without major {{adjustments}} to their 1961 constitution. Indeed, intergovernmental correspondence during early 1963 did much to confirm Salisbury's belief that this was the case. While Federal break-up talks progressed, Sandys issued a letter of intent in which he said that powers conferred on the Federal government by British legislation would transfer to Southern Rhodesia at the end of Federation. It was agreed that Salisbury would keep the Federal overseas missions in Pretoria and Lourenço Marques, as well as the British Embassy desks in Bonn, Tokyo and Washington. Arrangements for Federal dissolution concluded in mid-1963, and the Federation formally ended on 31 December that year. Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland became independent during 1964, respectively renamed Zambia and Malawi, under black majority governments. Southern Rhodesia was denied the same on the grounds that whites held too dominant a position, prompting indignation and fury from the governing Rhodesian Front (RF) and its supporters. Prime Minister Winston Field's failure to secure independence from Britain during early 1964 led to his forced resignation and replacement by his deputy, Ian Smith, in April that year.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by service {{levels in}} terms of the waiting time {{distribution}} seen in e. g. call centers, we consider two models for systems with a service disciple that depends on the waiting time. The first model deals with a single server that continuously adapts its service rate based on the waiting time of the <b>first</b> customer <b>in</b> <b>line.</b> <b>In</b> the second model, one queue is served by a primary server which is supplemented by a secondary server when the waiting of the <b>first</b> customer <b>in</b> <b>line</b> exceeds a threshold. Using level crossings for the waiting time process of the <b>first</b> customer <b>in</b> <b>line,</b> we derive steady-state waiting time distributions for both models. The results are illustrated with numerical examples...|$|R

Born to a Han Bannerman family, her original family name was Liu (劉), and this was changed to the Manchu clan name Lingiya when she became the concubine of Yixuan and was transferred to a Manchu banner.
