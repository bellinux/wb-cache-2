5|$|One of Igarashi's {{prominent}} concerns during {{development was}} addressing the criticism expressed concerning <b>Harmony</b> of Dissonance. Igarashi {{noted that the}} music in <b>Harmony</b> of Dissonance had not been well received and Michiru Yamane, who had previously worked on the acclaimed music for Symphony of the Night, was hired in order to compose for Aria of Sorrow. The development team worked on the game's audio cycles, as well as delegating more cartridge space and processor cycles for the sound. Maintaining the visual quality of <b>Harmony</b> of Dissonance was a chief objective during development, as many reviewers had felt that <b>Harmony</b> of Dissonance had excelled in graphics {{at the cost of}} the audio. Furthermore, the staff tried to improve the series' gameplay system while retaining fan-favorite elements. Certain aspects that were missing in <b>Harmony</b> of Dissonance, such as hidden rooms, were incorporated into Aria of Sorrow. Igarashi added Soul trading via a link cable to assist players with collecting every soul in the game, which he believed would be cumbersome to accomplish alone.|$|E
