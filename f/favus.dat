50|$|Since ancient times, Siberian dwarf pine, {{especially}} its young spring shoots and sapwood were considered a good anti-scorbutic treatment.Fresh bark {{was attached to}} cuts and {{was considered to be}} able to pull arrows from wounds. Fertilized branches were used in Trans-Baikal and in the Far East in baths against rheumatism, lumbago and gout. Bud tea is used as a diuretic, and in the form of inhalations - as an expectorant and disinfectant for treatment of upper respiratory tracts; infusion and tea was taken against pulmonary tuberculosis. In Chinese medicine roots are used against <b>favus</b> scab. Resin was used against skin diseases as an all-purpose healing treatment. Anti-biotic and anti-scorbutic action of the pine infusions are acknowledged by clinical tests.|$|E
5000|$|The scalp ringworm, {{also known}} as tinea capitis, mycosis, thrichophytia, and <b>favus,</b> {{was one of the}} most common fungal {{diseases}} in children in the Jewish communities in Israel and abroad since the 19th century. This X-ray treatment for ringworm has been used around the world as early as 1897. An estimated 200,000 children worldwide received X-ray treatment for tinea capitis in accordance with the standard Adamson-Kienbock procedure between 1910 and 1959, until griseofulvin, the first effective antifungal agent for ringworm, was introduced. [...] At the beginning of the 20th century, Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem treated ringworm disease among the religious Jewish community in Jerusalem using irradiation and the disease almost disappeared.|$|E
5000|$|The use of both scalp flaps, {{in which}} a band of tissue with its {{original}} blood supply is shifted to the continue bald area, and free grafts {{dates back to the}} 19th century. In 1897, Menahem Hodara successfully implanted hair taken from the unaffected areas of the scalp on to the scars that were left bald by <b>favus.</b> Modern transplant techniques began in Japan in the 1930s, where surgeons used small grafts, and even [...] "follicular unit grafts" [...] to replace damaged areas of eyebrows or lashes, but not to treat baldness. Their efforts did not receive worldwide attention at the time, and the traumas of World War II kept their advances isolated for another two decades.|$|E
5000|$|As {{late as the}} 17th {{century in}} Europe, persons with severe <b>favus</b> and similar fungal {{diseases}} (and potentially also with severe psoriasis and other diseases not caused by microorganisms) tended to be classified as having leprosy. The painting The Regents of the Leper Hospital in Haarlem 1667 by Jan de Bray (Frans Hals Museum, Haarlem, the Netherlands) shows a young Dutchman with a vivid scalp infection. It may {{have been caused by}} a fungus, but he is being cared for by three officials of a charitable home intended for leprosy sufferers.

50|$|In {{addition}} to simple rashes, inflammations, and swellings, the Biblical text mentions {{a number of}} other conditions that could be confused with tzaraath. Among other situations the text considers harmless are the appearance of dull white spots, white patches of skin without sores, and baldness without sores; the latter two of these are thought by scholars to most probably refer to vitiligo and alopecia, respectively, and the Bible remarks that the former - the dull white spots - are merely a form of freckles. The symptoms that the text considers to be indicative of disease include those of the spread of superficial swellings or spots (where there had previously been a boil), and those of reddish-white sores in areas of baldness; the former condition is identified by the Bible as plague, and scholars regard its symptoms as pointing to a diagnosis of smallpox, while the latter is unidentified in the Biblical text, but considered by scholars to indicate <b>favus.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{rainfall}} {{over the}} Red Sea and its coasts is extremely low, averaging 0.06 m per year. The rain is mostly short showers, often with thunderstorms and occasionally with dust storms. The scarcity of rainfall and no {{major source of}} fresh water to the Red Sea result in excess evaporation as high as 205 cm per year and high salinity with minimal seasonal variation. A recent underwater expedition to the Red Sea offshore from Sudan and Eritrea found surface water temperatures 28 °C in winter and up to 34 °C in the summer, but despite that extreme heat the coral was healthy with much fish life with very little sign of coral bleaching, with only 9% infected by Thalassomonas loyana, the 'white plague' agent.

The hospital was considered to be one of the most extensive public health systems in the world, using advanced methods in medicine that had just been introduced, such as fluoroscopy and an autoclave that could sterilize entire mattresses. For many immigrants, new medical equipment was unfamiliar and scary. According to one New York Times article, “those less fortunate had to submit to physical inspections that required stripping off all of one’s clothing - an entirely foreign concept, particularly to many immigrant women. Some immigrants had no idea what X-ray machines did; others were fearful that their clothing - or the money sewn inside its seams - would be stolen.” ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} type of tinea capitis, microsporosis, trichophytosis, and favus; these {{are based on}} the causative microorganism, {{and the nature of the}} symptoms. In microsporosis, the lesion is a small red papule around a hair shaft that later becomes scaly; {{eventually}} the hairs break off 1-3 mm above the scalp. This disease used to be caused primarily by Microsporum audouinii, but in Europe, M. canis is more frequently the causative fungus. The source of this fungus is typically sick cats and kittens; it may be spread through person to person contact, or by sharing contaminated brushes and combs. In the United States, Trichophytosis is usually caused by Trichophyton tonsurans, while T. violaceum is more common in Eastern Europe, Africa, and India. This fungus causes dry, non-inflammatory patches that tend to be angular in shape. When the hairs break off at the opening of the follicle, black dots remain. <b>Favus</b> is caused by T. schoenleinii, and is endemic in South Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by a number of yellowish, circular, cup-shaped crusts (scutula) grouped in patches like a piece of honeycomb, each about the size of a split pea, with a hair projecting in the center. These increase in size and become crusted over, so that the characteristic lesion can only be seen around the edge of the scab.|$|E

5000|$|He cures a leper {{who comes}} to him asking for a cure and tells him to show the priests and offer the {{cleaning}} sacrifices Moses had commanded (...) , but not to tell people that Jesus had done it. Jesus here seems to {{stress the importance of}} the Mosaic law, see also Expounding of the Law. This episode is also recorded in the Egerton Gospel 2:1-4. People have seen Jesus telling the man to be quiet about what had happened as related to the Messianic Secret, although it could be Jesus just telling the man to immediately go to the priests. Leprosy could mean many skin diseases, such as <b>favus</b> or psoriasis. Mark says Jesus had [...] "compassion" [...] for the man, although a few manuscripts say he was angry, and some have argued that angry was the original word intentionally changed to make Jesus look less angry, as he is described as giving a [...] "stern", embrimēsamenos (Strong's G1690), warning to the man in verse 43. Mark however also shows Jesus' anger in many other places, such as [...] and the incident at the Temple, see also Expounding of the Law#Anger. Bruce Metzger's Textual Commentary on the Greek NT postulates a possible [...] "confusion between similar words in Aramaic (compare Syriac ethraham, [...] "he had pity," [...] with ethra'em, [...] "he was enraged")." [...] See also Aramaic primacy. The man then seems to disobey and spreads the news, increasing Jesus' popularity even more. Whether or not he ever made it to the priests Mark does not say. This is the first of many times in Mark that Jesus unsuccessfully tries to conceal his workings by telling people to keep what he has done a secret. Karris argues that one could also read it as Jesus [...] "spreading the news", not the man.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} keratinophilic {{and is known}} for causing {{diseases}} on human skin. The genus Microsporum contains a number of pathogens to both humans and animals. The diseases it causes is classified as Tinea or ringworm, with an adjective prescribing to the afflicted body part. Infection usually occurs as Tinea capitis with suppuration and kerion formation. Pus formation can also occur from palpitated hair follicles. The species is ectothrix in terms of hair infection and can infect more than {{one part of the}} scalp at a time. The fungus produces hyphal growth at the scalp, and produces fronds (perforating organs) that invade the hair perpendicularly at the cortex {{near the edge of the}} cuticles. This can cause hair to be easily removed and dislodged from the scalp. Additionally, individuals with thick dark hair have a tendency to have a more severe inflammatory response. Tinea corporis, as well; this is characterized as an intense inflammatory response resembling a bacterial infection, thus surgical intervention is not needed because inflammation is due to the fungus alone. Also, Tinea pedis, or athletes foot is common, while Tinea unguium is rare. Additionally Tinea manuum, of the thighs may occur as nodular granulomatous perifolliculitis, has been noted with infection of the thighs. <b>Favus,</b> (a severe form of Tinea capitis) is rarely seen to be caused by this fungus. However the most common cause in humans seems to be Tinea capitis and Tinea corporis. As such clinical manifestations are localized to localization of contact. Transmission from animals to humans is supported; especially in those constrained to agricultural work. Handlers of laboratory animals, including guinea pigs, cats, and rabbits can also be at risk of contracting the fungi if the animals were predisposed to a certain area. The fungus infects animals that associate themselves with soil on a repeated basis. So as such animals like cattle are commonly affected but horses, rodents, monkeys and dogs have a tendency to acquire it. Entry of the fungus or contraction of one or more of these diseases is caused by deposition on human skin, and contact with soil is usually the primary cause of infection. Quantitatively, animal or humans must acquire at least ten fungal spores on a keratin rich surface in order to acquire an infection. Additionally of the mating types, the positive strain is more pathogenic then the negative strain. Identification is usually classified on the appearance of the fungus on the host via a sample culture. Both M. gypseum and M. fulvum have been commonly isolated from patients with human infections of the disease. Human to human transmission is known to occur.|$|E
40|$|Algoa Bay Latrunculid sponges {{are well}} known for their {{production}} of cytotoxic pyrroloiminoquinones with speculation that these secondary metabolites may have a microbial origin. This study describes a thorough investigation into the bacterial community associated with Tsitsikamma <b>favus,</b> Tsitsikamma scurra a newly described Latrunculia sp. and a yellow encrusting sponge associated with T. scurra. Molecular and chemical characterisation were {{used in conjunction with}} traditional taxonomy in identification of the sponge specimens. The 28 S rRNA and COX 1 analysis confirmed the traditional taxonomy with T. <b>favus</b> and T. scurra being very closely related. Chemical analysis revealed that T. <b>favus</b> and T. scurra shared the discorhabdins 2, 4 -debromo- 3 -dihydrodiscorhabdin C, 7, 8 -dehydro- 3 -dihydrodiscorhabdin C and 14 -bromo- 1 -hydroxy-discorhabdin V in common with each other and Tsitsikamma pedunculata indicating that these pyrroloiminoquinones are common to Tsitsikamma sponges in general. The bacterial community associated with T. <b>favus</b> was explored using 16 S rRNA molecular techniques including DGGE, clonal libraries of full length 16 S rRNA genes, as well as 454 pyrosequencing. DGGE analysis revealed that the bacterial community associated with T. <b>favus</b> appeared to be highly conserved, which was confirmed by both the clone library and 454 pyrosequencing, with the Betaproteobacteria as the most dominant class. Further exploration into T. <b>favus,</b> as well as T. scurra, Latrunculia sp. and the yellow encrusting sponge indicated that the bacterial populations associated with each of these sponge species were conserved and species specific. OTU analysis to the species level revealed that T. <b>favus</b> and T. scurra shared an abundant Spirochaete species in common while the most abundant species in the Latrunculia sp. and the yellow encrusting sponge belonged to the class Betaproteobacteria. The exclusivity of the tsitsikammamines to T. <b>favus</b> precipitated attempts to culture the T. <b>favus</b> associated bacteria, with a focus on the dominant betaproteobacterium as indicated by the 16 S rRNA clone library. Actinobacteria associated with the Algoa Bay sponge specimens were also cultured and the actinobacterial isolates were sent for screening against Mycobacterium aurum with two Kocuria kristinae isolates and a Streptomyces albdioflavus isolate showing good antimycobacterial activity...|$|E

Therefore, {{the present study was}} aimed to analyze the enzymes involved in stress induced by coral pathogen and its resistance. We focused on the enzymes involved in melanin synthesis pathway (phenoloxidase (PO) and peroxidases (POD)) and free radical scavenging enzymes (super oxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT)) and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) in selected scleractinian corals such as Acropora formosa, Echinopora lamellosa, Favia <b>favus,</b> Favites halicora, Porites sp., and Anacropora forbesi. Overall, PO activity of coral was significantly lower than that of zooxanthellae except for Favia <b>favus.</b> Coral colonies with lower PO and POD activities are prone to disease.
