5|$|Henry II {{appears as}} a {{character}} in several modern plays and films. He is a central character in James Goldman's 1966 play The Lion in Winter, set in 1183 and presenting an imaginary encounter between Henry's immediate family and Philip Augustus over Christmas at Chinon. The 1968 film adaptation communicates the modern popular view of Henry as a somewhat sacrilegious, fiery and determined king although, as Goldman acknowledges, Henry's passions and character are essentially fictional. The Lion in Winter {{has proved to be}} an enduring representation of Henry, being turned into an Academy-Award-winning film and remade in 2003 for television. Henry also appears in the play Becket by Jean Anouilh, filmed in 1964; once again, however, the character of the King is deliberately fictitious, driven by the need for drama between Henry and Becket in the play. The Becket controversy also forms the basis for T. S. Eliot's play Murder in the Cathedral, where the tensions between Henry and Becket form the basis both <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more superficial events of Becket's death, and Eliot's deeper religious interpretation of the episode.|$|E
