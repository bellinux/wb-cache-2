5|$|Expansion of Metrolink {{has been}} a key {{strategy}} of transport planners in Greater Manchester, who have overseen its development in successive projects, known as Phases 1, 2, 3a and 3b with the most recent phase, 2CC becoming operational in February 2017. Construction work on the Trafford Park Line extension from Pomona to the Trafford Centre commenced in early 2017 with an estimated operational date of 2020/21. Furthermore, TfGM <b>have</b> <b>endorsed</b> more speculative expansion proposals for new lines to Stockport, a loop around Wythenshawe, {{and the addition of}} tram-train technology.|$|E
5|$|The {{authenticity}} of the Libellus (notwithstanding Boniface's suspicions, on which see below) was not called into serious question until the mid-twentieth century, when several historians forwarded {{the hypothesis that the}} document had been concocted in England in the early eighth century. It has since been shown, however, that this hypothesis was based on incomplete evidence and historical misapprehensions. In particular, twentieth-century scholarship focused on the presence in the Libellus of what appeared to be an impossibly lax rule regarding consanguinity and marriage, a rule that (it was thought) Gregory could not possibly <b>have</b> <b>endorsed.</b> It is now known that this rule is not in fact as lax as historians had thought, and moreover that the rule is fully consistent with Gregory's style and mode of thought. Today, Gregory I's authorship of the Libellus is generally accepted. The question of authenticity aside, manuscript and textual evidence indicates that the document was being transmitted in Italy by perhaps as early as the beginning of the seventh century (i.e. shortly after Gregory I's death in 604), and in England {{by the end of the}} same century.|$|E

25|$|Though {{he was an}} able {{military}} commander and proved a useful partisan of Caesar, Lepidus has always been portrayed as the weakest member of the triumvirate. He typically appears as a marginalised figure in depictions {{of the events of}} the era, most notably in Shakespeare's plays. While some scholars <b>have</b> <b>endorsed</b> this view, others argue that the evidence is insufficient to discount the distorting effects of propaganda by his opponents, principally Cicero and, later, Augustus.|$|E

Other chiropractors have actively promoted fluoridation, and several chiropractic organizations <b>have</b> <b>endorsed</b> scientific principles of public health. In addition to traditional chiropractic {{opposition to}} water fluoridation and vaccination, chiropractors' attempts to establish a positive reputation for their public health role are also compromised by their reputation for recommending repetitive lifelong chiropractic treatment.|$|E
