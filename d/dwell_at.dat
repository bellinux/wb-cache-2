They primarily resided in southern Ithilien, along {{the shores of the}} Anduin. After Elessar's death in 120 F.A., Legolas built a ship and sailed to Valinor and, eventually, all of the elves in Ithilien followed him. It is also implied that Elves continued to <b>dwell</b> <b>at</b> the Grey Havens, at least for a certain period. [...] Tolkien states that Sam Gamgee sailed from the Havens decades after Elrond's departure, implying that some Elves might have remained in Mithlond at that time.|$|E

[...] When the first English settlers came to Aquidneck Island in 1638, they organized a quarterly court and English-style jury trial. [...] In 1640, Newport established monthly courts, rights of appeal, and trial by jury, whereas in Providence there was no court, no judge, and no jury.|$|E

500|$|Adams {{arrived in}} New York {{a few days}} before Washington, and first presided over the Senate on April 21. Washington was inaugurated as the first President of the United States on April 30, 1789, at Federal Hall in New York, then the nation's capitol. The presidential oath of office was {{administered}} by Robert Livingston, the Chancellor of the State of New York. Washington took the oath on the building's second floor balcony, in view of throngs of people gathered on the streets. The Bible used in the ceremony was from St. John's Lodge No. 1, A.Y.M., and was opened at random to Genesis 49:13 ("Zebulun shall <b>dwell</b> <b>at</b> the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon").

500|$|Abbot Bower also {{described}} the king {{as capable of}} stabbing a near relative through the hand for creating a disturbance at court. The abbot was generally supportive of James but he and others besides regretted {{the demise of the}} Albany Stewarts and that he was confounded by James's greed for territory and wealth. Although Bower didn't <b>dwell</b> <b>at</b> length on the negative aspects of James's character he alluded to the dismay of even those close to the king at his harsh regime. John Shirley's account of the events leading up to James's murder in the work The Dethe of the Kynge of Scotis provided an accurate narrative of politics in Scotland and which must have depended upon knowledgeable witnesses. The Dethe describes James as 'tyrannous' and whose actions were motivated by revenge and 'covetise [...] [...] [...] than for anny laweful cawse'. Shirley agrees with Bower as far as the Albany Stewarts were concerned when he wrote that the Albanys 'whos dethe the people of the land sore grutched and mowrned'. Writing nearly a century later both the chroniclers John Mair and Hector Boece relied extensively on Bower for their own narratives. They described James as the embodiment of good monarchy with Mair's eulogy that James '...indeed excelled by far in virtue his father, grandfather and his great-grandfather nor will I give precedence over the first James to any of the Stewarts' while Boece in similar vein calls James the 'maist vertuous Prince that evir was afoir his days'. Late in the 16th century the early historians George Buchanan and Bishop John Lesley from opposite ends of the religious spectrum both looked favourably on James's reign but were uneasily mindful of an enduring aggressive history regarding the king.|$|E

2500|$|The South Ferry loop station {{proved to}} be a service bottleneck. Operationally, the loop station functioned an {{intermediate}} station rather than as a true terminal, as trains would simply proceed back to Rector Street without the motorman needing to go to the reverse end of the train. Additionally, unlike most terminal stations in the system, there were neither layup tracks nor an additional track to store terminating trains, and there were no additional layup tracks along the line until at least 34th Street–Penn Station. This meant that trains could not <b>dwell</b> <b>at</b> the station for longer for 90 seconds (including the 5 to 10 seconds each that it took to extend and retract the gap fillers). Any trains that went out of passenger service at the station could have caused major delays along the rest of the line. Finally, trains could only proceed through the station at slow speeds, adding 30 to 60 seconds to travel time compared to a [...] "regular" [...] terminal station with two tracks and a full-length platform. [...] This ensured that 1 trains were delayed at the Chambers Street station, three stops north, for up to two minutes in both directions.|$|E
