50|$|In economics, a {{complementary}} good or complement {{is a good}} with a negative cross elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand,</b> {{in contrast to a}} substitute good. This means a good's demand is increased when the price of another good is decreased. Conversely, the demand for a good is decreased when the price of another good is increased. If goods A and B are complements, an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the <b>demand</b> curve <b>of</b> A and cause the demand curve for B to shift in; less of each good will be demanded. A decrease in price of A will result in a rightward movement along the <b>demand</b> curve <b>of</b> A and cause the demand curve B to shift outward; more of each good will be demanded. Basically this means that since the <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> one good is linked to the <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> another good, if a higher quantity is <b>demanded</b> <b>of</b> one good, a higher quantity will also be <b>demanded</b> <b>of</b> the other, and if a lower quantity is <b>demanded</b> <b>of</b> one good, a lower quantity will be <b>demanded</b> <b>of</b> the other. The prices of complementary goods are related in the same way: if the price of one good rises, so will the price of the other, and vice versa. With substitute goods, however, the price and quantity <b>demanded</b> <b>of</b> one good is related inversely to the price and quantity <b>demanded</b> <b>of</b> a substitute good, meaning that if the price or quantity <b>demanded</b> <b>of</b> one good rises, the price or quantity <b>demanded</b> <b>of</b> its substitute will fall.|$|R

Scientific forecasting China's energy <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> road transportation is a key for make long-term development plans of the nation's road transportation, and relevant policies of environmental protection and energy-saving. Basing on the energy <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> China's road transportation, considering the factors average fuel consumption of singleautomobile and the workload of road transportation, the paper does a comprehensive forecasting for China's energy <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> transportation in the future. The result is that in 2030, the energy <b>demand</b> <b>of</b> road transportation will amount to 250 million tons, which is 1. 4 times that of 2020, and 2. 3 times that of 2010.
