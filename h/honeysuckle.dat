5|$|Now {{widely known}} as coast banksia or coastal banksia, B.integrifolia was {{previously}} known by {{a range of}} common names. The Checklist of Australian Trees lists four other common names: <b>honeysuckle,</b> white banksia, white bottlebrush and white honeysuckle; and some older sources {{refer to it as}} <b>honeysuckle</b> oak.|$|E
5|$|Common names include {{northern}} banksia, white banksia, <b>honeysuckle</b> {{or white}} bottlebrush. A local aboriginal name is jingana, in the Jirrbal and Girramay languages.|$|E
5|$|Nelson's touring and {{recording}} group, the Family, {{is full of}} longstanding members. The original lineup included his sister Bobbie Nelson, drummer Paul English, harmonicist Mickey Raphael, bassist Bee Spears, Billy English (Paul's younger brother), and Jody Payne. The current lineup includes all the members but Jody Payne, who retired, and Bee Spears, who died in 2011. Willie & Family tours North America in the bio-diesel bus <b>Honeysuckle</b> Rose, which is fueled by Bio-Willie. Nelson's tour buses were customized by Florida Coach since 1979. The company built the <b>Honeysuckle</b> Rose I in 1983, which was replaced after a collision in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1990. The interior was salvaged and reused for the second version of the bus the same year. Nelson changed his tour bus in 1996, 2005 and 2013, currently touring on the <b>Honeysuckle</b> Rose V.|$|E

There was to be a parsonage the size of a lunch-wagon, and hens and <b>honeysuckles</b> when we were married. Arthur used to preach to me a good deal about Heaven, but he never could get my mind quite off those <b>honeysuckles</b> and hens.|$|R

5|$|As well as {{recording}} over sixty studio albums, Nelson {{has appeared}} in over thirty films and TV shows. His acting debut was in the 1979 film, The Electric Horseman, followed by appearances in <b>Honeysuckle</b> Rose, Thief, and Barbarosa.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Grayson {{constructed}} Grayson's Tavern in Danville {{sometime around}} 1785. The asymmetrical, ell-shaped building faces south onto Walnut Street with a front entrance {{on the south}} and a side entrance on the west, which opens onto Constitution Square. The Mary Akin Memorial Herb Garden, located behind Grayson's Tavern, features a variety of herbs that were commonly cultivated in the area during the late 18th and early 19th century, including chives, fennel, <b>honeysuckle,</b> lavender, rosemary, sage, and thyme. The garden is maintained by the Garden Club of Danville and named for one of its long-time members.|$|E

50|$|Stewardship {{services}} include island cleanups, work projects, monitoring, and {{the removal}} of invasive species such as Japanese Knotweed, Black Swallowwort, Asiatic Bittersweet, Japanese Barberry, and Bush <b>Honeysuckles.</b>|$|R
5|$|Flora {{along the}} {{northern}} end of the trail includes sumac (Rhus) and <b>honeysuckle</b> (Lonicera) shrubs, American elm (Ulmus americana), bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata) and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides). As the trail approaches Gardiner to the south, there are occurrences of sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), tulip-tree (Liriodendron tulipifera) and black birch (Betula lenta). Other trees common on the trail include red maple (Acer rubrum), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis), eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), white ash (Fraxinus americana) and eastern white pine (Pinus strobus).|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{invasive}} plants live {{along the}} Saw Mill River. Porcelain berry is a vine with white berries that wraps around native trees and strangles them. Oriental bittersweet is also present along the river, {{and it is}} slowly displacing the native American bittersweet. Oriental bitterweet can also form hybrids with the native bittersweet and making identification harder. Japanese <b>honeysuckle</b> and Japanese knotweed are two other invasive vines native to Asia. In addition, purple loosestrife, a perennial herb with magenta flower stalks, is also present along the river.|$|E
5|$|The mixed {{woodland}} region is a dense forest with {{many species of}} trees, located near {{the tops of the}} plateaus. The forest canopy shades the ground, resulting in a cooler temperature. The canopy also reduces the amount of water evaporation. California black oak, Douglas fir, Pacific madrone, incense cedar, and other plants grow in the {{mixed woodland}}. Shrubs such as Oregon grape, <b>honeysuckle,</b> blue elderberry, and Pacific poison oak also grow here. The soil in this area is mostly loam.|$|E

5000|$|Anisacanthus is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} bear's breeches family, Acanthaceae. The generic name {{is derived from the}} Greek words ανισος (anisos), meaning [...] "unequal," [...] and ακανθος (acanthos), meaning [...] "thorn." [...] Members of the genus are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are commonly known as desert <b>honeysuckles,</b> though this term is shared with the genus Ancistranthus, and is something of a misnomer as true <b>honeysuckles</b> (genus Lonicera) belong to the family Caprifoliaceae. Anisacanthus species are sometimes cultivated for use in xeriscaping.|$|R
5|$|An {{important}} {{collection of}} Willie Nelson materials (1975–1994) {{became part of}} the Wittliff collections of Southwestern Writers, Texas State University, San Marcos, Texas. The collection contains lyrics, screenplays, letters, concert programs, tour itineraries, posters, articles, clippings, personal effects, promotional items, souvenirs, and documents. It documents Nelson's IRS troubles and how Farm Aid contributions were used. Most of the material was collected by Nelson's friend Bill Wittliff, who wrote or co-wrote <b>Honeysuckle</b> Rose, Barbarosa and Red Headed Stranger. In 2014, Nelson donated his personal collection to the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History. The items include photographs, correspondence, song manuscripts, posters, certificate records, awards, signed books, screenplays, personal items and gifts and tributes from Nelson's fans.|$|E
5|$|Banksia serrata {{was first}} {{collected}} at Botany Bay on 29 April 1770, by Sir Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, naturalists on the British vessel HMS Endeavour during Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook's first voyage to the Pacific Ocean. The species was not published until April 1782, when Carolus Linnaeus the Younger described {{the first four}} Banksia species in his Supplementum Plantarum, commenting {{that it was the}} showiest species in the genus. As the first named species of the genus, Banksia serrata is considered the type species. Banksia serrata has the common names of old man banksia, saw banksia, saw-toothed banksia and saw-leaved banksia. It is also known as red <b>honeysuckle</b> and red banksia from the colour of its timber.|$|E
5|$|Banksia serrata, {{commonly}} known as old man banksia, saw banksia, saw-tooth banksia and red <b>honeysuckle,</b> is a species of woody shrub or tree of the genus Banksia in the family Proteaceae. Native to {{the east coast of}} Australia, it is found from Queensland to Victoria with outlying populations on Tasmania and Flinders Island. Commonly growing as a gnarled tree up to 16m (50ft) in height, it can be much smaller in more exposed areas. This Banksia species has wrinkled grey bark, shiny dark green serrated leaves and large yellow or greyish-yellow flower spikes appearing over summer. The flower spikes, or inflorescences, turn grey as they age and pollinated flowers develop into large, grey, woody seed pods called follicles.|$|E

5|$|Still Jennifer Lopez is a women's {{fragrance}} {{endorsed by}} American entertainer Jennifer Lopez, released by Coty, Inc. in October 2003. The fragrance contains notes of sake, mandarin, early grey, pink freesia, <b>honeysuckle,</b> orange flower, sandalwood, amber and orris. Still Jennifer Lopez {{followed in the}} footsteps of Glow by JLo, an international success that shaped the fragrance industry and began a trend in the celebrity endorsement of fragrance. The release of Still Jennifer Lopez was not anticipated due to the negative publicity generated from Lopez's film Gigli (2003) and a fall-out with her manager Benny Medina. Several fragrance industry experts noted that it could ruin the success of Glow by JLo. It was also noted that her public image at the time would have irreparable effects on the fragrance's performance.|$|E
5|$|The Fonteyn Kill and its {{riparian}} zone {{are home to}} a variety of species. Caddisflies, clams and mussels, crayfish (Astacidae), damselflies, gammarids, isopods (Asellidae), oligochaetes, black flies, leeches, chironomids, bladder snails, and other snails were recorded in the stream in 2010. Trees {{along the banks of the}} Fonteyn Kill include American elms, sugar maples, black cherries, Norway maples, and red maples, while barberry, privet, holly, Japanese knotweed, <b>honeysuckle,</b> spicebush, common reeds, and Japanese roses make up the kill's riparian shrubs. Carp, mallards, great blue herons, frogs, snapping turtles, and other birds also reside in and around the stream. A 1924 source observed that trout fishing occurred on the kill.|$|E
5|$|The German birds {{wintering}} in British gardens rely on provided food, and {{the major}} items are bread and fat, each making up around 20% of the diet; one bird survived the whole winter eating only Christmas cake. Fruit is also eaten, notably cotoneaster (41% of the fruit consumed), ivy and <b>honeysuckle,</b> and apple if available. Some birds have learned to take peanuts from feeders. Blackcaps defend good winter food sources in the wild, and at garden feeding stations they repel competitors as large as starlings and blackbirds. Birds occasionally become tame enough to feed from the hand.|$|E
50|$|This bee {{occurs in}} {{maritime}} Canada, temperate forest, the Canadian Prairies, tundra, and taiga. It lives {{in and around}} wooded areas. It feeds on several types of plants, including cohosh, fireweeds, kalmia, <b>honeysuckles,</b> bergamot, blackberries, and bilberries. It nests underground.|$|R

50|$|Haploporus thindii {{has been}} {{reported}} from South India, and in 2005 {{was reported in the}} Xizang Autonomous Region in southwestern China. The Chinese collections were found growing on the decomposing wood of <b>honeysuckles</b> (genus Lonicera) and maple (Acer). It has also been recorded in Taiwan.|$|R
5|$|Twelve {{tree species}} have been {{observed}} near Lake Chillisquaque. These include two oak species, two maple spaces, red elm, boxelder, shagbark hickory, black tupelo, American basswood, eastern hop-hornbeam, black ash, and musclewood. Ten shrub species also grow near the lake. These include three dogwood species, two holly species, multiflora rose, Morrow's <b>honeysuckle,</b> speckled alder, spicebush, and mayberry. Eighteen species of herbs live on the lake, as well. Five of these species are sedges. Cattails and beds of grass grow along the shores of Lake Chillisquaque. Additionally, a sizable population of Rotala ramosior grows on the lake.|$|E
5|$|Nominate T. merula may {{commence}} breeding in March, but {{eastern and}} Indian races are {{a month or}} more later, and the introduced New Zealand birds start nesting in August (late winter). The breeding pair prospect for a suitable nest site in a creeper or bush, favouring evergreen or thorny species such as ivy, holly, hawthorn, <b>honeysuckle</b> or pyracantha. Sometimes the birds will nest in sheds or outbuildings where a ledge or cavity is used. The cup-shaped nest is made with grasses, leaves and other vegetation, bound together with mud. It is built by the female alone. She lays three to five (usually four) bluish-green eggs marked with reddish-brown blotches, heaviest at the larger end; the eggs of nominate T. merula are 2.9×2.1centimetres (1.14×0.93in) in size and weigh 7.2grammes (0.25oz), of which 6% is shell. Eggs of birds of the southern Indian races are paler than those from the northern subcontinent and Europe.|$|E
5|$|At 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong {{opened the}} hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface. The Remote Control Unit {{controls}} {{on his chest}} kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface. The first landing used slow-scan television incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing {{the quality of the}} picture. The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by <b>Honeysuckle</b> Creek Tracking Station in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia. Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth. Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.|$|E
