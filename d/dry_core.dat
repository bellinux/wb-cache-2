40|$|A {{comparison}} between laboratory experiments and log measurements {{was done to}} investigate the effect of core damage on compressional wave velocities. This was done using 43 rock samples extracted from a 45 meters thick turbidite reservoir. We used Gassmann fluid substitution to obtain low-frequency saturated velocities from <b>dry</b> <b>core</b> measurements (thus mitigating the dispersion effects) taken at reservoir pressure. To mitigate the scale effect (or under-representation of reservoir properties {{by a number of}} small cores), we apply a correction for small mismatch between the core and log porosities. Comparison of these computed velocities with the sonic log measurements shows very good agreement. This confirms that for this particular portion of the reservoir the effect of core damage on ultrasonic measurements is below the measurement error.

The resulting silica particle-functionalized PNIPAm core particles show reversible swelling and shrinking as the temperature is cycled. These particles form close-packed-array photonic crystals as the solvent evaporates; the cores shrink to form a silica shell around the pure PNIPAm <b>dry</b> <b>core</b> particles as they close pack. The PNIPAm cores were removed by calcination, leaving a PC composed of essentially pure continuous silica shells. These silica shell photonic crystals Bragg diffract UV light at ~ 310 nm.

40|$|Abstract. Air drying of intact {{sediment}} cores from {{a shallow}} freshwater wetland caused {{the release of}} a substantial amount of ammonium following reflooding. The increased ammonium concentration stimulated nitrification at a rate 10 times higher than in the original waterlogged sediments under aerated conditions. Under non-aerated conditions, nitrate concentrations decreased more rapidly in reflooded systems than in the waterlogged systems. Ammonium and nitrite had accumulated in the original waterlogged systems, but this was rare in reflooded <b>dried</b> <b>cores</b> because of the depletion of bioavailable organic carbon. These results suggest that drawdown and drying of wetlands can accelerate mineralization of the organic matter in sediment, and can temporarily increase ammonium and nitrate concentrations in the water column during reinundation. Drying and reflooding of wetland sediments may eventually increase N loss through promotion of denitrification...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} impregnating increments of 3 -inch diameter cores of unconsolidated sedi-ment with a polyester resin {{so that they can}} be studied in the same way as ordinary rock samples. The impregna-tion of soft sediments has three main advantages: (1) the slabbed cores show many structures and textures that are invisible or indistinct in broken or sliced soft-sediment cores; (2) multiple slabs of the same core permit a serial, three-dimensional examination of sedimentary structures, particularly those produced by organisms; (3) impregnation and slabbing simplify storage, provide specimens for sectioning, and make the cores readily avail-able for study. Briefly, the method consists of vacuum and pressure impregnation of the <b>dried</b> <b>cores</b> with polyester esin.

The data generated demonstrate simple linear relationships between Vp and Vs. For <b>dry</b> <b>core</b> plugs, the Vp-Vs curve passes through zero and it indicates a nearly constant Compressional to Shear wave velocity ratio.

The relationships of Compressional and Shear wave velocities with porosity show that the velocities decrease with increase in porosity.
