25|$|The {{causes of}} the Great Recession seem similar to the Great Depression, but {{significant}} differences exist. The previous chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, had extensively studied the Great Depression {{as part of his}} doctoral work at MIT, and implemented policies to manipulate the money supply and interest rates <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not done in the 1930s. Bernanke's policies will undoubtedly be analyzed and scrutinized in the years to come, as economists debate the wisdom of his choices. Generally speaking, the recovery of the world's financial systems tended to be quicker during the Great Depression of the 1930s as opposed to the late-2000s recession.|$|E

25|$|This era {{signaled}} {{the loss of}} any lingering neoclassical, pseudo-Grecian styles in women's dress. This decline was especially evident in France due to the Emperor Napoleon's suppression of trade in the fabrics used in neoclassical dress. While waistlines were still high, they were beginning to drop slightly. Larger and more abundant decoration, especially near the hem and neckline foreshadowed greater extravagance in the coming years. More petticoats were being worn, and a stiffer, more cone-shaped skirt became popular. Stiffness could be supplemented by layers of ruffles and tucks on a hem, as well as corded or flounced petticoats. Sleeves began to be pulled, tied, and pinched <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> more influenced by romantic and gothic styles than neoclassical. Hats and hairstyles became more elaborate and trimmed, climbing higher to balance widening skirts.|$|E

The computer-controlled system allows the building to be illuminated <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> unable to be done previously with plastic gels. For instance, on November 6, 2012, CNN used {{the top of the}} Empire State Building as a scoreboard for the 2012 United States presidential election. When incumbent president Barack Obama had reached the 270 electoral votes necessary to win re-election, the lights turned blue. Had Republican challenger Mitt Romney won, the building would have been lit red. Also, on November 26, 2012, the building had its first ever synchronized light show, using music from recording artist Alicia Keys. The building's owners adhere to strict standards in using the lights; for instance, they would not use the lights to play advertisements.|$|E
25|$|Therapsids {{and earlier}} mammaliaforms had their jaw joints very {{far back in}} the skull, partly because the ear was at the rear end of the jaw but also had {{to be close to}} the brain. This {{arrangement}} limited the size of the braincase, because it forced the jaw muscles to run round and over it. Hadrocodium's braincase and jaws were no longer bound to each other by the need to support the ear, and its jaw joint was further forward. In its descendants or those of animals with a similar arrangement, the brain case was free to expand without being constrained by the jaw and the jaw was free to change without being constrained by the need to keep the ear near the brain — in other words it now became possible for mammaliaforms both to develop large brains and to adapt their jaws and teeth <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> purely specialized for eating.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the details}} the team added are post-war effects that {{continue}} on the battlefield throughout the game, where dust and smoke continue to roll through the streets, clouding up vision, and junk and debris scattered everywhere.

[...] She further elaborated, [...] "A lot of that [...] was based on my visual inspiration. I took Hype into my salon area in my home ... it's like my creative den. He took the ideas and then took other ideas and related to the ideas, and it just was really iconic imagery." [...] The video itself features a strong sexual theme with scenes of S and bondage, as well as scenes in a church and several prestigious-looking buildings. Aguilera wore several hairstyles and outfits, including many which were dominatrix-style.|$|E
2500|$|A {{study of}} the {{phenomenon}} in 1959 by religious history professor Ernesto de Martino revealed that most cases of tarantism were probably unrelated to spider bites.

The result was mass panic, with a [...] "cure" [...] that allowed people to behave <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>were,</b> normally, prohibited at the time.

2500|$|In {{establishing}} its arguments, The Skeptical Environmentalist {{examined a}} wide range of issues in the general area of environmental studies, including environmental economics and science, and came to an equally broad set of conclusions and recommendations. Lomborg's work directly challenged popular examples of green concerns by interpreting data from some 3,000 assembled sources. The author suggested that environmentalists diverted potentially beneficial resources to less deserving environmental issues <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> economically damaging.

2500|$|It was {{not until}} [...] that Chekhov saw the production, in a {{performance}} without sets but in make-up and costumes at the Paradiz Theatre. He praised the production but was less keen on Stanislavski's own performance; he objected to the [...] "soft, weak-willed tone" [...] in his interpretation (shared by Nemirovich) of Trigorin and entreated Nemirovich to [...] "put some spunk into him or something". He proposed that the play be published with Stanislavski's score of the production's mise en scène. Chekhov's collaboration with Stanislavski proved crucial to the creative development of both men. Stanislavski's attention to psychological realism and ensemble playing coaxed the buried subtleties from the play and revived Chekhov's interest in writing for the stage. Chekhov's unwillingness to explain or expand on the script forced Stanislavski to dig {{beneath the surface of}} the text <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> new in theatre.|$|E
2500|$|William Tsutsui, {{author of}} Godzilla on My Mind, {{discussed}} {{the new film}} {{in an article in}} Foreign Affairs magazine. [...] "This latest reboot brings to the screen a Godzilla that remains true to the spirit of the Japanese series while creating a very American, very twenty-first-century monster." [...] He noted that the film [...] "depicts gluttony for food and sex <b>in</b> <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> never a feature of Japanese productions. There are far more overt displays of affection in the first 15 minutes of the 2014 Godzilla than in the entire Japanese franchise, which totaled one very chaste kiss over 50 years." [...] He also noted that the film is more violent than the Japanese series, showing more carnage. The Godzilla character, in its heroism, is reminiscent of the 1960s and 1970s Japanese Godzilla, but not anthropomorphized like those. Also, the identity of the character as Japanese is lost: [...] "In the 28 films made by Toho, Godzilla is unmistakably identified as one of wareware Nihonjin (we Japanese). After liberating San Francisco from the spawning MUTOs, Godzilla is thus crowned as a defender of the United States." ...|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, Geographer Douglas L.

[...] Independently finding precedent in the opinions of previous scholars such as Ibn Khaldun as well as common currency in antagonistic cultural attitudes towards non-sedentary peoples, governments and international organizations have made use of Hardin's work to help justify restrictions on land access and the eventual sedentarization of pastoral nomads despite its weak empirical basis. Examining relations between historically nomadic Bedouin Arabs and the Syrian state in the 20th century, Dawn Chatty notes that [...] "Hardin's argument [...] was curiously accepted as the fundamental explanation for the degradation of the steppe land" [...] in development schemes for the arid interior of the country, downplaying the larger role of agricultural overexploitation in desertification as it melded with prevailing nationalist ideology which viewed nomads as socially backward and economically harmful.|$|E
