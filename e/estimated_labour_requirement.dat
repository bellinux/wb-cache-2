A similar pattern of behaviour to that already recognised as existing in the airframe industry is found to operate, though there are indications of quantitative differences. The build-up time to the planned peak rate of production in a particular situation {{is found to be}} about eighteen months but with variation between firms. The reduction in operator performance time, which occurs with repetition during the build-up period and afterwards, is discovered to be present in machining as well as assembly, but to a lesser extent. The logarithmic function generally descriptive of such a tendency is found to fit the actual man-hour content values rather than the cumulative average ones. The relationship between the logistic of output and the logarithmic function is established and made use of to <b>estimate</b> <b>labour</b> <b>requirements</b> from the commencement of production onwards. In addition to the above consideration of production variables, examples are given of the use of engine performance ratings to estimate costs. Finally, because of the importance of planning to productivity, a typical production programme has been included...|$|R

30|$|Development of a {{systematic}} framework to manage global food security {{has become a}} priority for the global community. India faces the challenge and pressure to feed over 1.25 billion people. Despite economic growth and self-sufficiency in food grains production, high levels of poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition persist in India (WFP 2015). The National Food Security Act (NFSA) passed in 2013 is a milestone {{in the history of}} Indiaâ€™s fight against hunger and malnutrition, as it claims to feed more than 800 million Indians 12 with highly subsidised staple foods (WFP 2015). In this backdrop, the current paper evaluates the economy wide impact of NFSA on the Indian economy. It <b>estimates</b> the <b>labour</b> <b>requirement,</b> GDP growth, and indirect impact on the other sector of the economy. The paper also measures the impact as a result of NFSA on prices of different sectors of the economy. The Impact on environment including air and water pollution as well as land requirement has also been calculated.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the staffing and scheduling of IT help desk operators {{for a large}} petrochemical company. The objective {{is to reduce the}} labour cost by determining the best staffing level and employee weekly tour schedules required to meet the workload that varies over a 24 -hr operating period. Several steps are taken for the staffing and tour scheduling of an IT help desk agents. First, data on the number of calls is used to <b>estimate</b> hourly <b>labour</b> <b>requirements.</b> Next, new scheduling options are proposed to better match these requirements. An Integer Programming (IP) model is then formulated and solved to determine tour scheduling assignments. Finally, alternative schedules are evaluated in terms of tradeoffs between workforce size and cost, service level and employee utilisation. The chosen tour schedules provide better service with a lower cost and a smaller number of employees.

40|$|The {{study is}} based on an {{input-output}} analysis of Scotland's commodity trade in 1989, with the commodity trade results subsequently translated into trade in embodied labour. Brief methodological details are given later in the paper. The main focus of the research was to <b>estimate</b> the occupational <b>labour</b> <b>requirements</b> of Scottish output (ie. the labour required to satisfy Domestic demand plus the labour required to produce Scottish exports) and the labour displaced by Scottish imports {{from the rest of the}} UK (RUK) and the rest of the world (ROW) (ie the labour which would have been required in order to produce the imported goods domestically). This economy wide skills audit of Scottish Industry by SOC, (Standard Occupational Classification) facilitates an impartial evaluation of Scotland's trade in labour skills in 1989. It therefore measures Scottish skill requirements as evidenced by Scotland's actual trading and business activity, not by what is thought to be Scotland's needs. The analysis provides clear evidence to guide the examination of where the domestic availability of skills relative to requirements is 'strongest' and where it is'weakest'...|$|R

Low <b>labour</b> <b>requirements</b> for establishment and management do not explain the rather low adoption and poor maintenance of vegetation barriers. <b>Labour</b> <b>requirements</b> for CVB are lower than for stone rows, but the establishment of barriers coincides with the start of the growing season.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{tendency}} in certain recent studies of industriallocation to use aggregated samples which draw together, and consider similarly, wide-ranging types of industrial production. With regard to labour considerations in mobile firms, interest has frequently gravitated towards {{an analysis of the}} variation in managerial competence to solve labour difficulties and has largely ignored the reality that the extent of the labour problem will vary between firms. This paper, with the aid of empirical data from the scientific and industrial instruments and systems industry, will argue that the product and process technologies of individual industries dictate the complexity of and <b>labour</b> <b>requirement</b> of firms.

40|$|The year-round {{demand for}} commercially {{produced}} vegetables in South-East Asia is growing rapidly because of ongoing {{population growth and}} urbanisation. Vegetable production {{plays an important role}} in the rural economy of the Red River Delta, the economic centre of northern Vietnam. Field vegetables, however, are often grown in the cool season from October to January, in rotation with wet rice in the cool and the hot season from February to September. As this often causes seasonality of vegetable supply, we designed alternative cropping systems, with the aim to develop year-round supply for big cities such as Hanoi, to increase farmersâ€™ income and to limit pest and disease incidence. Data on profit, <b>labour</b> <b>requirement</b> and costs of pesticide use of 42 vegetable crops grown in the Red River Delta were collected. From these data, five different permanent vegetable production systems were designed based on the following scenarios: (i) increase profit, (ii) reduce <b>labour</b> <b>requirement,</b> (iii) decrease the costs of pesticide use, (iv) maximize crop biodiversity, and (v) select crops with low perishable products, respectively. From May 2007 to May 2009, these systems were tested in the field and compared with the traditional system in which vegetable production in the cool season was rotated with wet rice cultivation in the cool and hot season. Profits of the high profit system and of the low <b>labour</b> <b>requirement</b> system was higher than that of the traditional system. The study suggests that permanent vegetable production systems such as the high profit system and the low <b>labour</b> <b>requirement</b> system can be an option to increase income for farmers in the Red River Delta, Vietnam...|$|R
