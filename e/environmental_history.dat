5|$|Paleontology lies on {{the border}} between biology and geology, but differs from {{archaeology}} in that it excludes the study of anatomically modern humans. It now uses techniques drawn {{from a wide range of}} sciences, including biochemistry, mathematics, and engineering. Use of all these techniques has enabled paleontologists to discover much of the evolutionary history of life, almost all the way back to when Earth became capable of supporting life, about 3.8 billion years ago. As knowledge has increased, paleontology has developed specialised sub-divisions, some of which focus on different types of fossil organisms while others study ecology and <b>environmental</b> <b>history,</b> such as ancient climates.|$|E

40|$|Inter-continental {{comparisons}} of <b>environmental</b> <b>histories</b> can improve understanding {{of environmental problems}} and hazards, and suggest possible actions to promote adaptive capacity and resilience in communities. This article presents evidence from two discrete studies incorporating the same integrated interdisciplinary methodology that look at montane foothill environments in France and South West China. The focus of research is on reconstructing the <b>environmental</b> <b>histories</b> of two lake catchment systems, Annecy in Haute-Savoie, France, and Erhai in Yunnan province, China. The initial findings from the comparison point to very similar sequences of an emergent flood problem in the late 17 th to early 18 th centuries related to upland land-use transformations of different origins that act upon longer-term sequences of environmental change. Flood problems in both catchments have been met by major engineering solutions that, whilst similar to some extent, differ in technical ingenuity. What this comparison makes clear {{is the importance of}} microvariation in environments within these catchments leading to similar, though not the same,adaptive responses to the environment. While it is clear that cultural nuances can be important causes of differences in environmental decision making, particularly in respect to choice and management options, but often the responses tend to be fairly consistent in their approaches to both environmental opportunities and problems...|$|R

40|$|Otolith {{chemistry}} is used widely {{to reconstruct the}} <b>environmental</b> <b>histories</b> of fish. Examining the relationships between environmental conditions and otolith {{chemistry is}} an essential first step towards accurately reconstructing <b>environmental</b> <b>histories,</b> with lack of information potentially resulting in the erroneous interpretation of fish movement and the environments they have inhabited. We evaluated the influence of seawater temperature and salinity on the otolith chemistry of juvenile King George whiting (Sillaginodes punctatus) (Cuvier 1829), a commercially and recreationally important fish species in southern Australia. Juveniles were reared under controlled laboratory conditions at four temperatures (16, 19, 22 and 25 °C) and two levels of salinity (30 and 40) for 90 days. Otoliths were analysed for barium (138 Ba), strontium (88 Sr), magnesium (24 Mg) and manganese (55 Mn) using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA ICP-MS), and ratioed to calcium (43 Ca). Otolith chemistry data were analysed using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM). Analyses showed that Mg:Ca and Mn:Ca in the otolith of the fish increased with increasing salinity, whereas Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca decreased with increasing salinity. Temperature only had a minor influence on elemental concentration. The influence of salinity on otolith chemistry suggests that otolith chemistry {{could be used as}} a potential tool for reconstructing the salinity and movement history of King George whiting from estuaries to open coast regions.

40|$|Copyright © 2002 NRC CanadaThe {{concentrations}} of elements and isotopes in fish otoliths {{may provide a}} method of reconstructing movements of fish by differentiating between water bodies of different temperatures and salinities. However, before otoliths {{can be used to}} reconstruct <b>environmental</b> <b>histories</b> of fish, it is necessary to assess the effects of seawater temperature and salinity on otolith microchemistry. Using controlled laboratory experiments, juvenile black bream, Acanthopagrus butcheri (family Sparidae), were reared for 50 days in aquaria of varying temperatures and salinities using three experimental designs: temperature x salinity, temperature only, and salinity only. Temperature and salinity interacted to significantly affect the elemental concentration ratios of Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca and the {{concentrations of}} isotopes 7 delta;[sup 13] C and δ[sup 18] O in otoliths. The single-factor experiments showed that temperature significantly affected the concentration ratios of Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca and the concentrations of δ[sup 13]C and δ[sup 18]O in otoliths, whereas salinity alone did not affect the concen-tration ratios of any elements but did affect both isotopes. The concentration ratios of Mg:Ca and Mn:Ca varied considerably among fish within the same treatment level and showed little or no effects due to temperature and (or) salinity. The significant interactive effects of temperature and salinity on otolith microchemistry highlight the need for a multifactorial approach to testing hypotheses regarding the <b>environmental</b> <b>histories</b> of fish.
