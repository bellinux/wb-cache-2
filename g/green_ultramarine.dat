2500|$|Blue {{is one of}} {{the three}} primary colours of {{pigments}} in painting and traditional colour theory, {{as well as in the}} RGB colour model. It lies between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light. The eye perceives blue when observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately 450 and 495 nanometres. [...] Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colors; azure contains some <b>green,</b> while <b>ultramarine</b> contains some violet. The clear sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering. [...] An optical effect called Tyndall scattering explains blue eyes. Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called atmospheric perspective.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to traditional mineral pigments, synthetic pigments, such as Paris <b>green</b> and artificial <b>ultramarine</b> are also detected. These two synthetic pigments were produced in Europe in early nineteenth century. Subsequently, {{they began to}} enter China and were identified on many paintings, architectural painting and temple murals of the late Qing Dynasty. For example, Paris green {{has been found in}} the pigments of a late Qing Dynasty Taoist portraits [39], the architectural painting of Zhendu gate in the Imperial Palace [40] and the Qing Dynasty wall painting in the Potala Palace and Drepung Monastery [41, 42]. The use of artificial ultramarine is more extensive than Paris green. In China, many paintings from the late Qing Dynasty were executed in artificial ultramarine. For example, most murals and painted sculptures of Qing Dynasty in Dun Huang grotto used artificial ultramarine [43]. Because Paris <b>green</b> and artificial <b>ultramarine</b> were also found in the samples of Jokhang temple, it is concluded that the wall paintings in the outside galley of Jokhang temple have been repaired and repainted in late Qing Dynasty, thus during the mid-nineteenth century or later.|$|R
30|$|The {{scientific}} investigations {{revealed that}} chrome yellow {{was used as}} yellow pigment in the Niche of the Qing Dynasty Tomb at Xihe Site in Zhangqiu, Shandong Province [14].

Ultramarine blue was largely used in Mogao Grottoes, Dunhuang, Gansu Province [18]. J. Mass found that Tibetan Thangka paintings of the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries used Western pigments, such as emerald <b>green,</b> <b>ultramarine</b> blue, and chrome yellow [19].|$|E
40|$|AbstractUltramarine is a {{synthetic}} analogue of lazurite, so called lapis lazuli. It was applied {{first of all}} as a pigment of lime- and gypsum-based plasters of folk architecture. Ultramarine is still used as a pigment of building materials, and, it may act as a non-traditional pozzolanic material as well. The paper describes a laboratory synthesis procedure of blue ultramarine that is derived from historic formulas. Structural, and optical properties and phase composition of laboratory-produced samples were compared to the samples of folk houses plasters and to unused, contemporary and historic industrially-produced ultramarines. The means of powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and polarizing optical microscopy were used. The properties of the laboratory-prepared samples were {{very close to the}} industrial ones. In the market, the commercially available ultramarines are blue, pink and purple. However, based on published data, {{it should be possible to}} produce <b>green</b> <b>ultramarine</b> by the modification of the production process. These colors were not reached during the laboratory experiments, even when the published formulas were precisely followed...|$|E
30|$|The {{materials}} used in Islamic paintings are discussed {{in a variety of}} historical sources, including Islamic treatises and travelers accounts. Recipes for the manufacture and use of artists’ materials in Islamic treatises have been extensively studied [1 – 9]. The Persian palette was divided into six primary colors, white, yellow, red, green, blue, black, and six metal-based pigments, gold, silver, brass, copper, tin, mica [5 – 7]. Of these, the inorganic materials can be separated into naturally occurring minerals—orpiment (arsenic sulfide) for yellow, cinnabar (mercuric sulfide), realgar (arsenic sulfide), and various ochres (iron oxides) for red, and lapis lazuli (ultramarine) for blue—and synthetic compounds—lead white (basic lead carbonate) for white, red lead (lead tetroxide) and vermilion/cinnabar (mercuric sulfide) for red, and verdigris (copper acetate) for green. Several organic materials were also used as pigments and include those derived from plants such as rhubarb and saffron for yellow, safflower and brazil wood for red, and indigo for blue, and those produced from insects such as kermes, cochineal and lac for red. Many of the recipes mentioned mixing the pigments with gums for preparation or use. One 16 th century Iranian paint box contained lead white, red lead, an organic red, yellow orpiment, organic yellow pigments derived from rhubarb and saffron, copper-based <b>green,</b> <b>ultramarine,</b> indigo and red and brown earth pigments [5, 7].|$|E
30|$|The {{pigments}} {{found in}} the fifteenth-century paintings were familiar—verdigris for <b>greens,</b> azurite and <b>ultramarine</b> for the blues, vermilion, red lead and red lakes for the reds and so on. Of most interest were two materials that functioned not as pigments but as additives to modify {{the properties of the}} paint; colourless powdered glass, and zinc sulphate, also known as zinc vitriol or white vitriol. These were also seen in the sixteenth-century works, but there were differences among the pigments when compared to the earlier paintings, such as the occasional use of the rare pigments fluorite and vivianite, and more significantly the introduction of the blue pigment smalt and a green mineral pigment composed predominantly of a copper sulphate.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of our investigations on a playing card preserved at The Mu¯zih-i A¯ ynih va Rushana¯ı¯ in Yazd, Iran. Conducting micro X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (m-XRF), micro-Raman spectroscopy (m-Raman), infrared reflectography (IRR), ultraviolet fluorescence photography, radiography, and optical microscopy, various paints applied on the playing card were identified. According to our analytical studies, red, green, blue, black, and gold-like metallic paints were identified to be a red monoazo pigment (b-naphthol PR 53 : 1), chrome <b>green,</b> artificial <b>ultramarine</b> blue, carbon black, and brass powder (Dutch metal powder), respectively, dating the playing card to 1895 onward based on the manufacturing date of the red monoazo pigment. Barite was also shown to be mixed with the pigments as an extender. On the other hand, the portrait’s face of the playing card was peculiarly blackened. Our analytical approach toward characterizing the blackened face showed that the black paint was achieved by carbon black and, in other words, the face was not blackened due to the darkening of Pb-bearing pigments. Moreover, it was shown that there was no underdrawing under the black face and the black paint was most probably executed in the same time with the other paints. Considering the possible use of the playing card, it was suggested not to remove the blackened face in the cleaning process since the black paint {{was a part of the}} integrity of the playing card...|$|R
30|$|The {{dominant}} blue {{identified on}} folios from all periods was ultramarine (lazurite or lapis lazuli). Although the plant-based dye stuff indigo {{was also used}} extensively, this rarely occurred as a blue pigment. Instead, indigo was used chiefly in mixtures—with yellow orpiment to create a dull or yellow <b>green</b> or with <b>ultramarine</b> to modify the shade of blue—or for highlights over other colors—particularly indigo lines on clothing and foliage. However, there were some examples of indigo and ultramarine being used alone, for example indigo was mixed with lead white in the sky while ultramarine was used for dark blue areas in Safavid folios from Shiraz (Table  1, # 32). Unusually, indigo is the only blue used on one folio from Cairo, 1354, (Table  1, # 12) despite the use of ultramarine in a companion folio from the same manuscript, (Table  1, # 11), indicating deliberate artistic choice rather than lack of availability of the more commonly used ultramarine.|$|R
40|$|<b>Green</b> {{and blue}} <b>ultramarine</b> {{pigments}} {{are characterized by}} the sodalite structure Na 6 (Al 6 Si 6 O 24) and colored inserted species. These chromophores are sulfur species: S 3 − (blue) and S 2 − (yellow). Both radicals are encapsulated inside the β-cages. They contribute to the EPR spectrum of ultramarine pigments. The well-known strong EPR signal observed in all ultramarine pigments Continuous-Wave (CW) spectra has long been assigned to S 3 − (g = 2. 029). In contrast, the S 2 − contribution is still subject to controversy because its signal in ultramarine pigments was not resolved even at low temperature in CW-EPR experiments. In this study, we identify unambiguously {{for the first time}} by CW-EPR and field sweep-echo detected (FS-ED) EPR the signal of S 2 − in ultramarine pigments and we determine its tensor components: g 1 = 2. 69 (6), g 2 = 2. 03 (4) and g 3 = 1. 86 (4) ...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} {{was carried out}} to obtain more information on materials and painting techniques used in Egyptian wall paintings during the 19 th century. The Hawsh al-Basha courtyard, dating back to Mohammed Ali's family period (1805 - 1952,) was studied for this purpose. The obtained results {{will be used to}} set up a scientific plan for restoration and preservation.

40|$|The human {{visual system}} is {{trichromatic}} and therefore reduces higher dimensional spectral data to three dimensions. Two stimuli with different spectral power curve shapes {{can result in}} the same cone response and therefore match each other. Color reproduction systems {{take advantage of this}} effect and match color by creating the same cone response as the original but with different colorants. ICC color management transforms all colors into a three-dimensional reference color space, which is independent from any input or output devices. This concept works well for a single defined observer and illumination conditions, but in practice, {{it is not possible to}} control viewing conditions leading to severe color mismatches, particularly for paintings. Paintings pose unique challenges because of the large variety of available colorants resulting in a very large color gamut and considerable spectral variability. This research explored spectral color reproduction using a seven-color electrophotographic printing process, the HP Indigo 7000. Because of the restriction to seven inks from the 12 basic inks supplied with the press, the research identified both the optimal seven inks and a set of eight artist paints which can be spectrally reproduced. The set of inks was Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black, Reflex Blue, Violet and Orange. The eight paints were Cadmium Red Medium, Cadmium Orange, Cadmium Yellow Light, Dioxazine Purple, Phthalo Blue <b>Green</b> Shade, <b>Ultramarine</b> Blue, Quinacridone Crimson and Carbon Black. The selection was based on both theoretical and experimental analyses. The final testing was computational indicating the possibility of both spectral and colorimetric color reproduction of paintings...|$|R

40|$|Multianalytical {{study of}} two Serbian icons, “The Virgin and Child” and “St. Petka”, painted on canvas by unknown authors was {{performed}} {{in order to identify}} materials used as pigments, binders and ground layer. Investigated icons belong to the Museum of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade. Samples, collected from different parts of the icons, were analysed by: optical microscopy (OM), energy dispersive X-Ray fluorescence (EDXRF), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and micro-Raman spectroscopy. Obtained results reveal presence of the following pigments: Prussian blue, <b>ultramarine,</b> <b>green</b> earth, iron oxides, lead white and zinc white. Linseed oil was used as a binder. Materials used for ground layers were gypsum, calcite, baryte and lead white. Gilded surface of the icon “The Virgin and Child” was made of gold. Gilded surface on the frame of this icon was made of imitation of gold i. e. Schlagmetal, since EDXRF spectroscopy showed presence of copper and zinc, while gold was not detected.

30|$|Combining site {{investigations}} with sampling analysis, {{the materials}} and production process of Jokhang temple wall paintings have been studied. The results show that most pigments used in the wall paintings are natural mineral pigments, such as cinnabar, azurite, malachite green, dark blue, red lead and orpiment. At the same time, some synthetic pigments, such as emerald <b>green</b> and artificial <b>ultramarine</b> are also found, indicating that the wall paintings have been repaired or repainted more recently (maybe in mid or late nineteenth century). In addition to natural mineral and artificial pigments, gold powder and gold foil were also used widely in the wall paintings. The wall paintings are made with Tibetan traditional craft and contain multiple ground layers, white preparation layer, paint layer and a thick surface varnish which contained drying oil (maybe tung oil) and pine resin. The binding media used in the paint {{is a kind of}} animal glue which is likely to be bovine/yak glue according to the tradition of Tibet. While the conservation of the wall paintings requires careful monitoring of the condition of the polychromy surface, the main causes of damage are human beings who touch the surfaces, and the failure of the building fabric, which requires routine inspection and regular maintenance. Efforts should thus be focused on preventive measures to ensure the long-term conservation of these important paintings.|$|R
40|$|A {{rich and}} {{non-invasive}} multi-technique {{study has been}} carried out on two ancient Moroccan manuscripts, dealing with theology, written in the 19 th century and belonging to different scribal schools of the western Arabic Mediterranean region. Currently, Moroccan manuscripts investigations are limited to codicological studies in which reports on illuminations and colored vocalizations are limited to visual descriptions. Hence scientific investigations are required for an objective characterization of this universal heritage. The integration of elemental and molecular information acquired by μ-XRF, μ-XRD, μ-Raman, μ-SERS, reflection mid-FTIR, UV-vis reflectance and UV-vis fluorescence has allowed for the characterization of both inorganic pigments and organic dyes. The inorganic pigments have been identified and characterized by combining the elemental XRF information with molecular infrared and Raman investigations. XRD analyses have been also carried out for the identification of crystalline compounds. Vermillion, orpiment, azurite, lead chromate, emerald green, Scheele's <b>green</b> and artificial <b>ultramarine</b> were identified. Red and yellow organic dyes have been identified by combining SERS, UV-vis reflection and UV-vis fluorescence spectroscopic techniques. The signals detected on red colors were assigned to the animal carminic anthraquinone, while those detected on yellows seem originating from a natural flavonoid. The present study, which is the first complete one undertaken on ancient Islamic documents of Morocco and being extended in situ to other artworks, unique in the Arabic world and available at the Moroccan libraries, will contribute to promoting codicological investigations, dating and authenticating some manuscripts and giving elements of response, useful for art history, in the knowledge of coloring materials used in the western Mediterranean Arabic region during the 19 th century. © 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|Ultramarine {{pigments}} are aluminosilicate-based {{and contain}} sulphur-based chromophores. Several samples from two batches of fine fly ash, a predominantly aluminosilicate waste product of coal combustion, were used successfully to synthesise ultramarine blue. This {{was confirmed by}} infrared, Raman and X-ray diffraction results. Fly ash {{had the advantage of}} being amorphous, whereas the traditional starting reagent, kaolin, needed to be heat-treated before the ultramarine synthesis to weaken its structure. A comparison of the scanning electron micrographs of fly ash, fly ash treated at 1 000 °C, fly ash reacted with sodium carbonate at 860 °C and the ultramarine products showed that sulphur had a structure-directing effect. The sulphur clusters found in ultramarine pigments were studied by Self-Consistent-Field Hartree-Fock theory extended by Møller-Plesset second order perturbation theory at the minimum energy with the 6 - 311 G** basis set to determine the relative stability of S 2, S 2 -•, S 22 -, and S 3, S 3 -•, S 32 -. The singly charged species were the most stable in both sets, supporting the hypothesis that the exothermic transition from <b>green</b> to blue <b>ultramarine</b> was the transformation of the doubly charged species to the singly charged species. The open, C 2 v, isomer was most stable for the S 3 -• molecule - the blue ultramarine chromophore. The S 4 molecule was a likely chromophore in ultramarine red. A Woodward-Hoffmann analysis supported the concerted formation of the puckered square S 4, pyramidal S 4, and gauche S 4 chain isomers. Other possible species for the red chromophore were S 4 -, S 3, S 3 Cl, S 3 Cl-, S 2 Cl, S 2 O, and S 2 O-. On the basis of their calculated vibrational spectra most of the species could be discounted as possible red chromophores. The best candidate chromophore was the cis S 4 chain based on the computed electronic spectrum. Thesis (PhD(Chemistry)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2005. Chemistryunrestricte...|$|R
6000|$|It is a {{favourite}} dogma among modern {{writers on}} colour that [...] "warm colours" [...] (reds and yellows) [...] "approach" [...] or express nearness, and [...] "cold colours" [...] (blue and grey) [...] "retire" [...] or express distance. So far is this {{from being the}} case, that no expression of distance {{in the world is}} so great as that of the gold and orange in twilight sky. Colours, as such, are ABSOLUTELY inexpressive respecting distance. It is their quality (as depth, delicacy, &c.) which expresses distance, not their tint. A blue bandbox set on the same shelf with a yellow one will not look an inch farther off, but a red or orange cloud, in the upper sky, will always appear to be beyond a blue cloud close to us, as it is in reality. It is quite true that in certain objects, blue is a sign of distance; but that is not because blue is a retiring colour, but because the mist in the air is blue, and therefore any warm colour which has not strength of light enough to pierce the mist is lost or subdued in its blue: but blue is no more, on this account, a [...] "retiring colour," [...] than brown is a retiring colour, because, when stones are seen through brown water, the deeper they lie the browner they look; or than yellow is a retiring colour, because when objects are seen through a London fog, the farther off they are the yellower they look. Neither blue, nor yellow, nor red, can have, as such, the smallest power of expressing either nearness or distance: they express them only under the peculiar circumstances which render them at the moment, or in that place, signs of nearness or distance. Thus, vivid orange in an orange is a sign of nearness, for if you put the orange a great way off, its colour will not look so bright; but vivid orange in sky is a sign of distance, because you cannot get the colour of orange in a cloud near you. So purple in a violet or a hyacinth is a sign of nearness, because the closer you look at them the more purple you see. But purple in a mountain is a sign of distance, because a mountain close to you is not purple, but green or grey. It may, indeed, be generally assumed that a tender or pale colour will more or less express distance, and a powerful or dark colour nearness; but even this is not always so. Heathery hills will usually give a pale and tender purple near, and an intense and dark purple far away; the rose colour of sunset on snow is pale on the snow at your feet, deep and full on the snow in the distance; and the green of a Swiss lake is pale in the clear waves on the beach, but intense as an emerald in the sunstreak, six miles from shore. And in any case, when the foreground is in strong light, with much water about it, or white surface, casting intense reflections, all its colours may be perfectly delicate, pale, and faint; while the distance, when it is in shadow, may relieve the whole foreground with intense darks of purple, blue <b>green,</b> or <b>ultramarine</b> blue. So that, on the whole, it is quite hopeless and absurd to expect any help from laws of [...] "aërial perspective." [...] Look for the natural effects, and set them down as fully as you can, and as faithfully, and never alter a colour because it won't look in its right place. Put the colour strong, if it be strong, though far off; faint, if it be faint, though close to you. Why should you suppose that Nature always means you to know exactly how far one thing is from another? She certainly intends you always to enjoy her colouring, but she does not wish you always to measure her space. You would be hard put to it, every time you painted the sun setting, if you had to express his 95,000,000 miles of distance in [...] "aërial perspective." ...|$|R
