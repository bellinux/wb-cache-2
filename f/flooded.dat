40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{urbanization}} rate and extreme rainfall {{as a form of}} the abnormal climate, the urban <b>flood</b> frequency has been increased. Therefore, it is very important for the policy makers to evaluate the urban <b>flood</b> vulnerability and propose the corresponding <b>flood</b> mit-igation policies. Since the interests on the urban <b>flood</b> mitigation is increased, many structural <b>flood</b> measures has been constructed. If a city has many structural <b>flood</b> measures, the city is considered as the <b>flood</b> safe city. In this study, inherent <b>flood</b> vulnerability is pro-posed using <b>Flood</b> Protection Capacity and Damage(PCD) matrix with the <b>flood</b> damage cost and constructed structural <b>flood</b> mit-igation measures.

Calculated inherent <b>flood</b> vulnerabilities were compared to the conventional <b>flood</b> vulnerability-resilience indices. The proposed inherent <b>flood</b> vulnerability showed more reasonable results. For example, Songpa and Mapo were considered as the <b>flood</b> safe districts because of its high financial independence rate and many constructed <b>flood</b> mitigation measures. However, their inherent <b>flood</b> vulnerability is relatively high. There results could show the comprehensive aspect on the <b>flood</b> mitigation policies...|$|R

40|$|<b>Floods</b> cause {{environmental}} hazards and influence on socio-economic activities. In this study, we evaluated the historic <b>flood</b> frequency at a confluence {{in the middle}} Yellow River, China. A non-parametric, multivariate, empirical, orthogonal function matrix model, which consists of time correlation coefficients of <b>flood</b> discharge at different gauge stations and <b>flood</b> events {{was used for the}} analysis of <b>flood</b> frequency. The model addresses the characteristics of confluent <b>floods</b> such as frequency and the probability in multiple tributary rivers. <b>Flood</b> frequency analysis is often coupled with studies of hydrological routing processes that reduce the <b>flood</b> capacity of the rivers. <b>Flood</b> routing to the confluence were simulated using kinematic wave theory. Results of this <b>flood</b> frequency analysis showed that <b>flooding</b> frequency has intensified in the past 500 years, especially during the 19 th century. <b>Flooding</b> in streams above the confluence was more frequent than in streams below the confluence. Over the last 2000 years, concurrent <b>flooding</b> in multiple tributary rivers accounted for 67. 5 % of the total <b>flooding</b> in the middle Yellow River. Simulation of <b>flood</b> routing processes shows that the decreased <b>flooding</b> capacity and elevated river bed of the shrunken main channel leads to an increased <b>flood</b> wave propagation time (24 – 52. 3 h) in the study area after 1995. The model indicates that human activities, such as constructions of the Sanmenxia Dam, have changed <b>flood</b> routing boundary conditions and have contributed to the increased <b>flood</b> frequency at the confluence.
