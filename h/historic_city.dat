5|$|Following the Metropolitan Police Act 1829 and the City of London Police Act 1839, {{the capital}} was policed by two forces, the Metropolitan Police, who held sway {{over most of}} the capital, and the City of London Police, who were {{responsible}} for law enforcement within the <b>historic</b> <b>City</b> boundaries. The events in Houndsditch in December 1910 fell into the purview of the City of London service, and the subsequent actions at Sidney Street in January 1911 were in the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan force. Both services came under the political control of the Home Secretary, who in 1911 was the 36-year-old rising politician Winston Churchill.|$|E

5|$|The {{bridge is}} named after Frances Pulteney, wife of William Johnstone. He was a wealthy Scottish lawyer and Member of Parliament. Frances was the third {{daughter}} of MP and government official Daniel Pulteney (1684–1731) and first cousin once removed of William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath. She inherited the Earl's substantial fortune and estates close to Bath in Somerset {{after his death in}} 1764 and that of his younger brother and heir in 1767, and the Johnstones changed their surname to Pulteney. The rural Bathwick estate, which Frances and William inherited in 1767, was across the river from the city and could only be reached by ferry. William made plans to create a new town, which would become a suburb to the <b>historic</b> <b>city</b> of Bath, but first he needed a better river crossing. The work of the Pulteneys is memorialised by Great Pulteney Street in Bathwick, and Henrietta Street and Laura Place, named after their daughter Henrietta Laura Johnstone.|$|E
5|$|The next {{assignment}} for 2e DB, {{and the one}} that it had been brought from Africa for, was the liberation of Paris. Allied troops initially avoided the <b>historic</b> <b>city,</b> moving around it to minimise the danger of destruction if the Germans sought to defend it. When Parisians rose against the Germans, de Gaulle and Leclerc persuaded General Dwight D. Eisenhower to help. Leclerc's men had to fight their way into Paris, and when they got there they found German infantry and tanks still holding parts of the city. The German commander, General der Infanterie Dietrich von Choltitz, was inclined to surrender, and did so to Leclerc and Henri Rol-Tanguy of the French Forces of the Interior at the Gare Montparnasse on 25 August 1944. Leclerc arranged for Ensign Philippe de Gaulle, who was serving in the RBFM, to be in attendance, but the elder de Gaulle was annoyed that Leclerc had allowed the communist Rol to co-sign the surrender. The next day de Gaulle held a triumphal parade, accompanied by senior military figures including Leclerc, Alphonse Juin, Marie-Pierre Kœnig and Georges Thierry d'Argenlieu.|$|E

5|$|During {{the ensuing}} German occupation, {{it became the}} command post for German forces in the Pas-de-Calais/Flanders region and was very heavily fortified, as it was {{generally}} believed by the Germans that the Allies would invade at that point. It was also used as a launch site for V1 flying bombs and {{for much of the}} war, the Germans used the region as the site for railway guns used to bombard the south-eastern corner of England. In 1943 they built massive bunkers along the coast in preparation for launching missiles on the southeast of England. Despite heavy preparations for defence against an amphibious assault, the Allied invasion took place well to the west in Normandy on D-Day. Calais was very heavily bombed and shelled in a successful effort to disrupt German communications and persuade them that the Allies would target the Pas-de-Calais for invasion (rather than Normandy). The town, by then largely in ruins, was liberated by General Daniel Spry's 3rd Canadian Infantry Division between 25 September and 1 October 1944. On 27 February 1945 Calais suffered a last bombing raid—this time by British bombers who mistook the town for Dunkirk, which was at that time still occupied by German forces. After the war there was little rebuilding of the <b>historic</b> <b>city</b> and most buildings were modern ones.|$|E

40|$|The {{state of}} {{conservation}} practice {{and the fate of}} <b>historic</b> buildings and <b>cities</b> reflect the critical issue of the value of heritage in Malaysia. The idea of safeguarding heritage has been far behind the agenda of the government until recent years. This has resulted in physical and cultural heritage loss. The consciousness of the importance of heritage has triggered the implementation of the National Heritage Act 2005 which focuses on safeguarding the nation's heritage. The implementation of the act, however, has been late when compared to the poor state of built heritage in Malaysia. This Base Line research focuses on how the conservation of heritage can lead to the regeneration of <b>historic</b> <b>cities.</b> The study seeks to identify the important characteristics of <b>historic</b> <b>cities</b> which give them identity and {{to examine the relationship between}} the conservation of historic buildings and the regeneration of <b>historic</b> <b>cities,</b> particularly in Malaysia, in order to understand the elements which should be taken into consideration in regeneration or redevelopment schemes carried out within <b>historic</b> <b>cities.</b> The scope of the research covers both theoretical and practical aspects of conservation practice and regeneration initiatives of <b>historic</b> <b>cities,</b> specifically relevant to Malaysia, taking into consideration social, cultural, political, and economic aspects and stakeholders' aspirations. This thesis explains the relationship between conservation of historic buildings and regeneration of <b>historic</b> <b>cities</b> by looking at the examples of regeneration schemes in the UK and development proposals by local authorities in Malaysia. The results from the study give an understanding of the scenario in the historic areas in Melaka and George Town, to assess whether the conservation proposals carried out have improved the area and have helped in regenerating the economy of the area, thus, to providing a baseline to demonstrate that the conservation of historic buildings can lead to the regeneration of historic areas in Malaysia.
