6000|$|The <b>implied</b> <b>confession</b> {{of her own}} {{intractable}} character, without {{religious faith}} to ennoble it, without even imagination to refine it--the unconscious disclosure of the one tender and loving instinct in her nature still piteously struggling for existence, with no sympathy to sustain it, with no light to guide it--would have touched the heart of any man not incurably depraved. Amelius spoke with the fervour of his young enthusiasm. [...] "I {{would go to the}} uttermost ends of the earth, if I thought I could do you any good. But, oh, it sounds so hopeless!" ...|$|E

With the project of leaving Florence as soon as his life there had become a high enough stepping-stone to a life elsewhere, perhaps at Rome or Milan, there was now for the first, time {{associated}} a desire to be free from Romola, and to leave her behind him. She had ceased to belong to the desirable furniture of his life: there was no possibility of an easy relation between them without genuineness on his part. Genuineness <b>implied</b> <b>confession</b> of the past, and confession involved a change of purpose. But Tito had as little bent that way as a leopard has to lap milk when its teeth are grown. From all relations that were not easy and agreeable, we know that Tito shrank: why should he cling to them? ...|$|E
40|$|The author {{first of}} all {{attempts}} to establish that the Christian confession of God must simultaneously <b>imply</b> <b>confession</b> of mankind and that without this it simply ceases to exist. Secondly, {{and more difficult to}} handle, is the assertion that the very idea of God implies relationship with mankind. Hence the author believes tha he can speak of > monotheism as opposed to > monotheism. Mankind is the finiteness of God, his fortunate finiteness which allows him to be God, that is to say a "God-of" and not a Divinity...|$|R

40|$|Offender {{profiling}} aims at generating {{information of}} an offender {{based upon the}} crime committed and {{the goal is to}} be an adjunct in the crime invesigation process. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine crime scene characteristics and corroborating evidence and their associations with offenders' interrogation behavior. Results from 207 analyzed police files indicated that reactive (impulsive) offenders confessed more often when there was technical evidence against them compared to instrumental (calculating) offenders. Reactive offenders also had more injuries. Injured reactive offenders were more inclined to deny, whereas injured instrumental offenders claimed amnesia more often. When comparing the confessions injured reactive offenders were more inclined to confess than injured instrumental offenders. There was also a strong tendency <b>implying</b> more <b>confessions</b> with witness reports. The findings point towards the practical usefulness of information of crime scene characteristics and corroborating evidence in the interrogation phase by better tailoring the interviewing strategy...|$|R
6000|$|In which passage {{does not}} there lie an <b>implied</b> <b>confession</b> that Teufelsdrockh himself, besides his outward obstructions, had an inward, still greater, to contend with; namely, a certain temporary, youthful, yet still afflictive derangement of head? Alas, {{on the former}} side alone, his case was hard enough. [...] "It {{continues}} ever true," [...] says he, [...] "that Saturn, or Chronos, or what we call TIME, devours all his Children: only by incessant Running, by incessant Working, may you (for some threescore-and-ten years) escape him; and you too he devours at last. Can any Sovereign, or Holy Alliance of Sovereigns, bid Time stand still; even in thought, shake themselves free of Time? Our whole terrestrial being is based on Time, and built of Time; it is wholly a Movement, a Time-impulse; Time {{is the author of}} it, the material of it. Hence also our Whole Duty, which is to move, to work,--in the right direction. Are not our Bodies and our Souls in continual movement, whether we will or not; in a continual Waste, requiring a continual Repair? Utmost satisfaction of our whole outward and inward Wants were but satisfaction for a space of Time; thus, whatso we have done, is done, and for us annihilated, and ever must we go and do anew. O Time-Spirit, how hast thou environed and imprisoned us, and sunk us so deep in thy troublous dim Time-Element, that only in lucid moments can so much as glimpses of our upper Azure Home be revealed to us! Me, however, as a Son of Time, unhappier than some others, was Time threatening to eat quite prematurely; for, strive as I might, there was no good Running, so obstructed was the path, so gyved were the feet." [...] That is to say, we presume, speaking in the dialect of this lower world, that Teufelsdrockh's whole duty and necessity was, like other men's, [...] "to work,--in the right direction," [...] and that no work was to be had; whereby he became wretched enough. As was natural: with haggard Scarcity threatening him in the distance; and so vehement a soul languishing in restless inaction, and forced thereby, like Sir Hudibras's sword by rust, ...|$|E
5000|$|Some {{writers were}} sharply {{critical}} of McGwire for his remarks in Congressional hearings in March 2005, {{in which he}} stated: [...] "I will not participate in naming names and implicating my friends and teammates. Asking me, or any other player, {{to answer questions about}} who took steroids in front of television cameras will not solve this problem. If a player answers, 'No,' he simply will not be believed. If he answers, 'Yes,' he risks public scorn and endless government investigations." [...] Many voters expressed concerns that his remarks constituted an <b>implied</b> <b>confession.</b> But Boswell defended McGwire's appearance, saying, [...] "He didn't make a non-confession confession. He simply said he refused to join a witch hunt. ... That's still a permissible position in America, right?" ...|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1916, due to its {{murders and}} other illegal {{activities}} and to halt its underground influence in both the army and politics, Serbian Prime Minister Nikola Pašić decided to destroy {{the leaders of the}} Black Hand and break up the organization. By the spring of 1917, many Black Hand leaders, including Dimitrijević, had been arrested. A sham trial before a military tribunal in Salonika was held in May 1917 for Apis and others. The charges were unrelated to the events of Sarajevo. Among the charges was that the Black Hand had attempted to murder Prince Regent Alexander. Though witnesses against them were numerous, the evidence cited was nearly all hearsay or outright fabrication. Dimitrijević and six others were sentenced to death. Three obtained commutations to long prison terms, but Apis and three comrades were executed by firing squad on 26 June 1917, against protests of the new Kerensky government of Russia. On his way to his execution, Dimitrijević reportedly commented that he was really being executed for planning the murder of Archduke Ferdinand. Before being shot, he made a written confession to the court that he had ordered Rade Malobabić to organize the assassination of Franz Ferdinand. Malobabić made an <b>implied</b> <b>confession</b> to a priest before he was executed. Vulović's confession came at trial where he said he received orders signed by Serbia's top military officer to send Malobabic into Austria-Hungary just before the assassination. Much later, a new trial was ordered by Yugoslavia and the convictions were overturned.|$|E

She felt she must do one of two things, laugh or scream and go on screaming, and she laughed. Peal after peal of laughter she sent echoing among the rocks, and Charles springing to his feet was {{just in time to}} catch her as she fell forward a dead weight into his arms.|$|R
40|$|Male {{and female}} in the church” (2008), by Breed, J. van Rens- burg and Jordaan, is {{reviewed}} {{as to its}} treatment of the regu- lative principle and its exegesis of 1 Timothy 2 - 3. The reformed and puritan version of the regulative principle, reflected {{in the writings of}} John Calvin and in the major reformed <b>confessions,</b> <b>implies</b> that proponents of women in the ecclesiastical office must do more than question the traditional exegesis of key passages used in the debate. They must provide Biblical war- rant for the practice. “Male and female in the church” outlines an option that defends the traditional exegesis of 1 Timothy 2 - 3. It also provides another option that seeks to explain 1 Timothy 2 : 8 - 15 in terms of the marriage-relationship rather than male and female in the church. The exegesis in the latter option is found to be tenuous. Similarly, the option that views 1 Timothy 3 : 11 as referring to ordained deaconesses is found to be unconvincing. No clear Biblical warrant is found in these pas- sages for the practice of ordaining women in the ecclesiastical office...|$|R
40|$|Supported by {{literature}} research, {{document and}} data collection, it {{is carried out}} an approach to the legal regulation of capital market, {{based on the review}} of regulatory instrument known as consent decree. It was noticed that, in accordance with Article 11, § 5 º of Law Nº. 6. 385 / 76, the rules issued by Brazilian Securities and Exchange Comission (CVM), which governs administrative sanctioning proceedings in ordinary and summary rites, prescribe that, when summons to an accused, a warning they may propose a term of commitment will follow. Anyways, once an offer is accepted and an agreement is in place, it does not <b>imply</b> into a <b>confession</b> to the facts nor a recognition of the illicit nature of investigated conduct. As of the examination of already established administrative sanctioning proceedings between 2009 and 2014, it is found total number of 405 terms approved by the regulator, results that feature a wide use of this regulatory instrument. From all that is analyzed, it is concluded that, although such an agreement can be recognized as an important mechanism in the context of capital market regulation, its excessive use implies to a distortion of its purposes, of foundations of normative discipline of the market, and of the set of functions assigned to the CVM...|$|R
40|$|Publication of {{this article}} was funded by the Stellenbosch University Open Access Fund. The {{original}} publication is available at [URL] part of the celebration of the Confessio Belgica (450 years after it was written) this contribution focuses on the hermeneutical frame presupposed by and interpretation of the Bible in the confession. It is clear that Guido de Bres (main author of the confession) was well read and was able to formulate the confession {{in such a way that}} it resonated with the protestant communities of faith in the southern Netherlands – what initially was intended as a polemical attempt to distantiate themselves from the Anabaptists soon became accepted a confession of faith. The Confessio Belgica does not quote directly from Scripture but refers to biblical verses and phrases by means of free association. The use of Scripture in the Confessio Belgica is pre-critical because the literal sense of the Bible is paramount and it does not reflect self critically in terms of its own presuppositions – this does not <b>imply</b> that the <b>confession</b> is intellectually suspect or deficient! The question is also posed whether the Confessio Belgica can continue to be understood as a “repetition of Sacred Scripture” or must it be held accountable for the way in which it interpreted Scripture in the sixteenth century to maintain relevance in the twenty-first century?Stellenbosch University Open Access FundPublishers' versio...|$|R
6000|$|But {{such high}} wrought {{feelings}} could not remain {{long in the}} same ecstatic tone. A thought pressed upon him, though he repelled it as ungrateful--as even blasphemous--that the frankness of the <b>confession</b> <b>implied</b> less delicacy {{on the part of}} her who made it, than was consistent with the high romantic feeling of adoration with which he had hitherto worshipped the Lady Isabelle. No sooner did this ungracious thought intrude itself, than he hastened to stifle it, as he would have stifled a hissing and hateful adder that had intruded itself into his couch. Was it for him--him the Favoured--on whose account she had stooped from her sphere, to ascribe blame to her for the very act of condescension, Without which he dared not have raised his eyes towards her? Did not her very dignity of birth and of condition reverse, in her case, the usual rules which impose silence on the lady until her lover shall have first spoken? To these arguments, which he boldly formed into syllogisms and avowed to himself, his vanity might possibly suggest one which he cared not to embody even mentally with the same frankness--that the merit of the party beloved might perhaps warrant, {{on the part of the}} lady, some little departure from common rules, and, after all, as in the case of Malvolio [Olivia's steward in Twelfth Night], there was example for it in chronicle. The Squire of low degree, of whom he had just been reading, was, like himself, a gentleman void of land and living, and yet the generous Princess of Hungary bestowed on him, without scruple, more substantial marks of her affection than the billet he had just received: ...|$|R
