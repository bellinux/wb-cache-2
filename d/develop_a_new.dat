5|$|For 1966, {{the engine}} {{capacity}} limit in Formula One was doubled from 1.5litres (92cuin) to 3litres (183cuin).

The Yhteissisu-produced models were named S-22.|$|E
5|$|The new 3-litre engines under {{development}} by competing team Ferrari had 12 cylinders.

He persuaded Australian company Repco to <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> 3-litre eight-cylinder engine for him, largely based on available components; the engine would produce less power than Ferrari's, but would be lighter, easier to fix and more fuel efficient.|$|E

5|$|After {{developer}} MachineGames was founded, {{the employees}} all began brainstorming ideas, and pitching them to publishers. In June 2009, MachineGames owner ZeniMax Media acquired id Software {{and all of}} its property, including Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein. Bethesda Softworks, who had previously declined a pitch from MachineGames, suggested that they <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> game from a franchise acquired by ZeniMax. MachineGames inquired about developing a new game in the Wolfenstein series; the studio visited id Software, who approved of MachineGames' request for a new Wolfenstein game. By November 2010, paperwork was signed, allowing MachineGames to develop Wolfenstein: The New Order. Preliminary development lasted approximately three years.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they were}} pagan, the Hungarians {{demonstrated}} a tolerant attitude towards Christians, Jews, and Muslims. The Byzantine Church {{was the first}} to successfully proselytize among their leaders: in 948 the horka, and around 952 the gyula, were baptized in Constantinople. In contrast, the grand prince Géza (c.970–997) received baptism according to the Latin rite. He erected fortresses and invited foreign warriors to <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> army based on heavy cavalry. Géza also arranged the marriage of his son, Stephen, with Giselle of Bavaria, a princess from the family of the Holy Roman Emperors.|$|E
5|$|Announced in May 2014, {{development}} on Far Cry 4 began {{immediately after the}} shipment of Assassin's Creed III in late 2012. The team originally intended to develop a direct sequel to Far Cry 3 that continues 3s story, but the idea was later scrapped and the team decided to <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> setting and new story for the game. Certain aspects of Far Cry 4 were inspired by the Nepalese Civil War, and the costume of the game's antagonist Pagan Min was inspired by Japanese films Ichi the Killer and Brother. The game's competitive multiplayer was created by Red Storm Entertainment while the Shangri-La segments in the campaign were handled by Ubisoft Toronto.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Megami Tensei II, Atlus {{acquired}} the rights to both develop and publish further Megami Tensei titles.

5|$|In 1935, the United States Department of the Interior {{created the}} Southwestern Range and Sheep Breeding Laboratory {{to address the}} {{problems}} Rambouillet stock had caused for the Navajo economy. Located at Fort Wingate, New Mexico, the program's aim was to <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> sheep bloodline that simulated the wool characteristics of the 19th-century Navajo-Churro stock and would also supply adequate meat. The Fort Wingate researchers collected old Navajo-Churro stock from remote parts of the reservation and hired a weaver to test their experimental wool. Offspring of these experiments were distributed among the Navajo people. World War II interrupted the greater part of this effort when military work resumed at Fort Wingate.|$|E
5|$|In August 1915, Spinks {{was tapped}} {{to join a}} consultative panel of notable players and major billiard hall proprietors to help <b>develop</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> handicapping system for balkline billiards, {{organized}} by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company, {{at that time the}} organizers of the World Championships. The inspiration for the new system was simply making it possible for the newly ascendant Willie Hoppe to be meaningfully challenged – his near-unassailability was hurting billiard tournament revenues, because the outcome was considered foreordained by many potential ticket-buyers. The system was expected {{to level the playing field}} in other ways, especially making it easier for skilled amateurs to enter the professional ranks.|$|E
