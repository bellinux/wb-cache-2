30|$|Unexpected {{differences}} in the online behavior of extroverts and <b>introverts</b> is observed based on these questions. <b>Introverts</b> post more frequently than do extroverts, especially during the day. However, extroverts visit different cities rather than staying in one familiar city as <b>introverts</b> do. The spatial discrepancy becomes more unintuitive as we zoom in to increased resolution. For example, <b>introverts</b> tend to check in while shopping, whereas extroverts enjoy posting from their workplace. In addition, {{a tiny fraction of}} <b>introverts</b> might attempt to camouflage their own loneliness by tweeting from a large number of different areas (> 20). Extroverts enjoy sharing music and selfies, whereas <b>introverts</b> prefer retweeting news. In terms of online interactions, extroverts mention friends more often than <b>introverts</b> do, implying higher social vibrancy. By presenting a purchasing index to depict online buying intention, we find that compared to extroverts, <b>introverts</b> devote more effort to posting shopping tweets to relieve loneliness {{due to a lack of}} social interaction with others. We also categorize the emotion delivered by tweets into anger, disgust, happiness, sadness, and fear [23] and find that <b>introverts</b> post more angry and fearful (high arousal) tweets while extroverts post more sad (low arousal) tweets. Finally, extroverts attach greater meaning to online virtual honor than <b>introverts</b> do, implying that they might be ideal candidates for online promotion campaigns with virtual honor. To the our best knowledge, this is the first study to thoroughly compare the online behavior of extroverts and <b>introverts</b> in a large-scale sample, and our findings will be helpful to understand the role of personality in shaping human behavior.|$|R

Bored with practice, she gave up playing piano at that time. Hoping for more freedom, she urged her parents to send her to Geelong Grammar School, an independent boarding school attended by her siblings. At Geelong she took up the piano again, this time playing jazz including performing with her brother David's group on weekends. She was <b>introverted</b> and found that piano practice helped her cope with living at boarding school.|$|E

25|$|However, {{a variety}} of {{findings}} contradict {{the claims of the}} social activity hypothesis. Firstly, it was found that extraverts were happier than <b>introverts</b> even when alone. Specifically, extraverts tend to be happier regardless of whether they live alone or with others, or whether they live in a vibrant city or quiet rural environment. Similarly, a study by Diener, Sandvik, Pavot, and Fujita (1992) showed that although extraverts chose social jobs relatively more frequently (51%) than nonsocial jobs compared to <b>introverts</b> (38%), they were happier than <b>introverts</b> regardless of whether their occupations had social or nonsocial character. Secondly, it was found that extraverts only sometimes reported greater amounts of social activity than <b>introverts,</b> but in general extraverts and <b>introverts</b> do not differ in the quantity of their socialization. Similar finding was reported by Srivastava, Angelo, and Vallereux (2008), who found that extraverts and <b>introverts</b> both enjoy participating in social interactions, but extraverts participate socially more. Thirdly, studies have shown that both extraverts and <b>introverts</b> participate in social relations, but that the quality of this participation differs. The more frequent social participation among extraverts could be {{explained by the fact that}} extraverts know more people, but those people are not necessarily their close friends, whereas <b>introverts,</b> when participating in social interactions, are more selective and have only few close friends with whom they have special relationships.|$|R
5|$|Kubrick {{attended}} William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945. One of {{his classmates}} was Edith Gormezano, later known as the singer Eydie Gorme. Though he joined the school's photographic club, which permitted him to photograph the school's events in their magazine, he was a mediocre student, with a meager 67 grade average. <b>Introverted</b> and shy, Kubrick had a low attendance record, and often skipped school to watch double-feature films. He graduated in 1945, but his poor grades, combined with the demand for college admissions from soldiers returning from the Second World War, eliminated hope of higher education. Later in life, Kubrick spoke disdainfully of his education and of contemporary American schooling as a whole, maintaining that schools were ineffective in stimulating critical thinking and student interest. His father was disappointed in his son's failure to achieve excellence in school, of which he felt Stanley was fully capable. Jack also encouraged Stanley to read from the former's library at home, {{while at the same}} time permitting Stanley to take up photography as a serious hobby.|$|E
5|$|Having been conscripted {{into the}} Confederate Ghost {{program as a}} child due to her psychic potential, Kerrigan is {{described}} in the manual for StarCraft as never having been given the chance for a normal life. Her rigorous training {{and the use of}} neural implants to control her mental abilities leave her withdrawn and <b>introverted.</b> Despite this, Kerrigan exhibits qualities of courage and daring, and is an effective tactician. She is also described as a moral character, exemplified in her opposition to Arcturus Mengsk using the Zerg against the Confederacy. However, after her transformation by the Zerg, Kerrigan is freed from her inhibitions—as well as her neural conditioning—and indulges her darker traits (though Heart of the Swarm implies that at least part of her villainy was due to the influence of a fallen Xel'naga named Amon). Her attitude, combined with her natural intelligence, makes her extremely calculating and manipulative. A hint of her former moral sensitivity is to be noted when {{towards the end of the}} Zerg campaign of Brood War, she states how she feels weary of slaughter for the first time since her transformation. Kerrigan has also become far more physically aggressive, relishing close quarters combat so much that at one point in the novel Queen of Blades, she begins absent-mindedly licking the blood of her victims from her fingers.|$|E
5|$|On {{top of all}} {{the misery}} the Zoroastrians had to pay a heavy {{religious}} tax known as Jizya. Zoroastrian sources record the method of extracting this as designed to humiliate the dhimmi, the taxed person, who was compelled to stand while the officer receiving the money sat on a high throne. Upon receiving the payment, the officer gave the dhimmi a blow on the neck and drove him roughly away. The public was invited to watch the spectacle. Arab tax collectors would mock Zoroastrians for wearing Kushti and would rip it off, hanging the cord around the necks of the beleaguered faithful. Due to corruption of the tax officials, at times twice and even three times the official figure would be collected, because every intermediary had to receive his share. If the families could not afford paying the Jizya, their children were beaten and even tortured and their religious books were thrown in fire. That is how the term “the bookless” came about. Under the woeful conditions, some had to convert and {{there were those who}} declared themselves Muslims, picked up Islamic names, but in secret continued Zoroastrian practices. Today the latter group among the Zoroastrians is known as Jaddid. In response to persecution and segregation policies, the Zoroastrians community became closed, <b>introverted,</b> and static.|$|E
25|$|Extraverts and <b>introverts</b> have {{a variety}} of {{behavioral}} differences.

In general, extraverts decorate their offices more, keep their doors open, keep extra chairs nearby, {{and are more likely to}} put dishes of candy on their desks. These are attempts to invite co-workers and encourage interaction. <b>Introverts,</b> in contrast, decorate less and tend to arrange their workspace to discourage social interaction.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} extraversion-related {{individual differences in}} visual short-term memory (VSTM) functioning. Event related potentials were recorded from 50 <b>introverts</b> and 50 extraverts while they performed a VSTM task based on a color-change detection paradigm with three different set sizes. Although <b>introverts</b> and extraverts showed almost identical hit rates and reaction times, <b>introverts</b> displayed larger N 1 amplitudes than extraverts independent of color change or set size. Extraverts also showed larger P 3 amplitudes compared to <b>introverts</b> {{when there was a}} color change, whereas no extraversion-related difference in P 3 amplitude was found in the no-change condition. Our findings provided the first experimental evidence that introverts' greater reactivity to punctuate physical stimulation, as indicated by larger N 1 amplitude, also holds for complex visual stimulus patterns. Furthermore, P 3 amplitude in the change condition was larger for extraverts than <b>introverts</b> suggesting higher sensitivity to context change. Finally, there were no extraversion-related differences in P 3 amplitude dependent on set size. This latter finding does not support the resource allocation explanation as a source of differences between <b>introverts</b> and extraverts...|$|R
25|$|The {{auxiliary}} function for extraverts is the secondary preference of the judging or perceiving functions, {{and it is}} experienced with an <b>introverted</b> attitude: for example, the {{auxiliary function}} for ESTJ is <b>introverted</b> sensing (Si) and the auxiliary for ESTP is <b>introverted</b> thinking (Ti).|$|E

25|$|The four {{functions}} {{operate in}} conjunction with the attitudes (extraversion and introversion). Each function is used in either an extraverted or <b>introverted</b> way.

This is surrounded by a ring of short tentacles that are used for feeding and in gas exchange. They are pink inside due to the presence of the pigment hemerythrin used in oxygen transport. The anus is on a small mound where the trunk and <b>introvert</b> join. The trunk is covered by a thick integument and is largely composed of bands of longitudinal muscles which can be seen through the cuticle. The anterior part of the trunk, into which the <b>introvert</b> retracts, is broader than the posterior part.|$|R

25|$|A {{study by}} Peter Kuppens (2008) showed that extraverts and <b>introverts</b> engage in {{different}} behaviors when feeling pleasant, {{which may explain}} underestimation of the frequency and intensity of happiness exhibited by <b>introverts.</b> Specifically, Kuppens (2008) found that arousal and pleasantness are positively correlated for extraverts, which means that pleasant feelings {{are more likely to}} be accompanied by high arousal for extraverts. On the other hand, arousal and pleasantness are negatively correlated for <b>introverts,</b> resulting in <b>introverts</b> exhibiting low arousal when feeling pleasant. In other words, if everything is going well in an extravert's life, which is a source of pleasant feelings, extraverts see such situation as an opportunity to engage in active behavior and goal pursuit, which brings about an active, aroused pleasant state. When everything is going well for <b>introverts,</b> they see it as an opportunity to let down their guard, resulting in them feeling relaxed and content.|$|R

40|$|Earlier {{research}} has shown that extraverts tend to increase their visual evoked potential amplitudes with increasing light intensity (augmenting), while <b>introverts</b> reach their maximum amplitude at lower intensities (reducing). The evoked response has normally been measured from association areas of the brain (at the vertex). The present study measured VEP amplitudes over visual cortex and at the vertex, using four light intensities in two conditions, where attention was either directed towards the light stimuli, or away from them by a concurrent auditory task. Forty subjects were classified as extraverts or <b>introverts</b> based on the Eysenck Personality Inventory. The results show that attention interacted significantly with extraversion. <b>Introverts</b> exhibited a narrower focus of attention, while higher amplitudes and amplitude-intensity functions when attending to the light flashes and loner when distracted. Extraverts showed smaller differences between conditions. indicating a more evenly distributed attention. Higher arousal in <b>introverts</b> is the probable cause of their narrower focus of attention. There were marked differences in the distribution of activity between vertex and occipital cortex. <b>Introverts</b> showed relatively stronger occipital responses and extraverts stronger vertex responses across all intensities and in both conditions. The predisposition for mainly perceptual responses to aversive stimuli in <b>introverts,</b> and for general alerting and motor preparatory responses in extraverts, are interpreted as supportive of Brebner and Cooper's hypothesis that <b>introverts</b> are 'geared to inspect' and extraverts are 'geared to respond'...|$|R
