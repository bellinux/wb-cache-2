500|$|For 2010, Solis's {{agenda was}} to enact some ninety new rules and {{regulations}} intended to grant more power to unions and to workers. [...] Whether Solis would try to revive Clinton administration ergonomics rules that had been discarded {{in the early days}} of the Bush administration, and that business groups continued to oppose, was unclear. [...] In the wake of the April 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in West Virginia, the worst in the U.S. in forty years, Solis announced that the Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration would conduct an internal review of its enforcement of the Massey Energy mine prior to the accident. [...] She also requested that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health provide an independent analysis of that review. [...] (By the end of her tenure, however, some safety experts said she had fallen short of getting any meaningful new regulatory scheme in place in the wake of the disaster.) [...] Later that month, Solis and the department hosted the first-ever meeting of the G-20 labor ministers; they discussed how to accelerate job creation in their respective countries. [...] Solis also faced disgruntlement from a local of the American Federation of Government Employees representing her own employees, who were unhappy that a longstanding <b>flextime</b> program reduced under the George W. Bush administration had not been restored. The department said the program was modern and fair and that it was part of ongoing contract negotiations with the local. The year also saw the department trying to crack down on firms that illegally use summer internships for free labor, by clarifying what may constitute an unpaid academic internship; the move brought resistance from universities. [...] The year additionally saw Solis leading an administration campaign against farmers who employed children or underpaid workers.

50|$|In 1981, Jay Kim and Anthony Campagna, {{researchers}} from Ohio State University, studied the effectsFlextime. <b>Flextime</b> allows workers {{to change their}} start and end work time. They first analyzed {{a wide range of}} studies done on <b>flextime.</b> Then they separated separated 353 employees into two groups: one that allowed <b>flextime,</b> and one that did not, or the control group. Their study found that <b>flextime</b> largely reduced unpaid absences for employees. They also found a general increase in worker performance, although, <b>flextime</b> could impact coordination, like meetings, as employee work schedules may vary.|$|E
50|$|Shift {{workers are}} {{generally}} excluded from <b>flextime</b> schemes as are senior managers. Other groups of workers for whom <b>flextime</b> arrangements are rare include those who {{serve the public}} during specific opening times.|$|E
50|$|In Florida, <b>flextime</b> workers, like {{salaried}} workers, are {{exempted from}} insurance regulations, and are given broad leeway in setting {{their own work}} schedule. Unlike exempted salaried workers, employers are still required to pay overtime to a <b>flextime</b> worker if they work more than 40 hours per week; some employers avoid this policy by dismissing their employees shortly before their scheduled working hours have been completed. In addition, the employer will usually require that a <b>flextime</b> employee works a minimum number of hours each week.|$|E
50|$|It is the {{workplace}} {{equivalent of the}} workforce policy of <b>flextime</b> and flexbenefits.|$|E
50|$|For employers, <b>flextime</b> can aid the {{recruitment}} and retention of staff. It has been a particularly popular option in 2009 for employers trying to reduce staff costs without having to make redundancies during the recession. It can also help provide staff cover outside normal working hours and {{reduce the need for}} overtime. Additionally <b>flextime</b> can also improve the provision of equal opportunities to staff unable to work standard hours.|$|E
50|$|In certain {{industries}} and disciplines, such as information technology, <b>flextime</b> permits workers to vary their schedule. For example, they may opt to work four 10-hour days per week, taking Monday or Friday off. Another <b>flextime</b> schedule {{is to work}} nine-hour days Monday through Thursday, an eight-hour day on Friday, taking every other Friday off. Workers may arrange to coordinate their days off so that their responsibilities are adequately covered.|$|E
5000|$|Provide enough {{freedom to}} {{facilitate}} job excellence. Encourage and reward employee initiative. <b>Flextime</b> or compressed hours could be offered.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flextime</b> {{can give}} {{employees}} greater freedom to organize their working lives to suit personal needs. In addition, travelling can be cheaper and easier {{if it is}} out of peak time.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Flextime</b> (also spelled {{flexitime}} English, flex-time) is {{a flexible}} hours schedule that allows workers to alter workday start and finish times. In contrast to traditional work arrangements that require employees {{to work a}} standard 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. day, <b>flextime</b> typically involves a [...] "core" [...] period of the day during which employees are required {{to be at work}} (e.g., between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.), and a [...] "bandwidth" [...] period within which all required hours must be worked (e.g., between 5:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m.). The working day outside of the [...] "core" [...] period is [...] "flexible time", in which employees can choose when they work, subject to achieving total daily, weekly or monthly hours within the [...] "bandwidth" [...] period set by employers, and subject to the necessary work being done [...] The total working time required of employees on <b>flextime</b> schedules is the same as that required under traditional work schedules. A <b>flextime</b> policy allows staff to determine when they will work, while a flexplace policy allows staff to determine where they will work. Advantages include allowing employees to coordinate their work hours with public transport schedules, with the schedules of their children, and with daily traffic patterns to avoid high congestion times such as rush hour. Some claim that flexible working will change the nature of the way we work.|$|E
50|$|MassMutual {{began to}} offer <b>flextime</b> for {{employees}} in 1968. While MassMutual focused on life insurance, policyowners began to invest money into money market funds. MassMutual responded by forming its own money {{market in the}} late 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Other {{workers may}} opt simply {{to come in}} early, such as 5 or 6 a.m., and leave in the mid-afternoon, or come in late and {{therefore}} leave late. One benefit of such a schedule is that commuting times occur outside of the congested rush hour traffic within a given geographic region. <b>Flextime</b> arrangements also help parents: one parent works 10 a.m - 6 p.m. and {{is in charge of}} the children before school / daycare, while the other parent works 7 a.m. - 3 p.m. and {{is in charge of the}} children after school / daycare. This allows parents time to commute. <b>Flextime</b> is also beneficial to workers pursuing an education.|$|E
50|$|Mendelsohn is {{a strong}} {{advocate}} of work-life balance and <b>flextime</b> for women with families. She has worked a four-day week since her first child, born during her tenure at BBH, was one year old. At Facebook, too, she works only from Monday to Thursday.|$|E
50|$|The program, {{currently}} {{known as}} Commuter Club, identifies potential carpool and vanpool partners and offers {{the latest information}} and services to help the approximately 70,000 employees in the Cumberland area save money on transit or set up teleworking and <b>flextime</b> program at work sites.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, 2012, 2013, 2014 Duane Morris {{was named}} one of the Working Mother and Flex-Time Lawyers [...] "50 Best Law Firms for Women," [...] and was cited for its Women's Initiative Program. Duane Morris is {{featured}} in the December/January issue of the magazine, and on workingmother.com and <b>flextime</b> lawyers.com.|$|E
50|$|The bank also {{experimented with}} <b>flextime</b> (to share office space) and {{telecommuting}} via virtual private networking. In October 2001, Lehman purchased a 32-story, 1050000 sq ft office building for a reported sum of $700 million. The building, located at 745 Seventh Avenue, {{had recently been}} completed, and not yet occupied, by rival Morgan Stanley.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantages}} of <b>Flextime</b> {{for the individual}} include a better work-life balance, fewer commutes, less fatigue, more days off, lower sickness rates. The benefits for the company include; better motivated workers, more efficient and effective operation, less fatigued workers, so fewer errors; they get people working overtime hours without paying overtime rates, fewer facilities required, and lower sickness rates.|$|E
5000|$|Work-life {{balance is}} an employeeâ€™s {{perception}} {{of how a}} proper balance between personal time, family care, and work are maintained with minimal conflict. Employers can use work-life balance as a motivational technique by implementing quality-of-work-life programs. Examples of such programs include <b>flextime,</b> workplace wellness, and family support. Flexible work schedules can allow an employee to work whenever they can {{as long as a}} certain amount of hours are worked each week and some employers allow their employees to work from home. [...] Sometimes employers utilize <b>flextime</b> schedules that allow employees to arrive to work when they choose within specified limits. [...] A wellness program can involve having an exercise facility, offering counseling, or even having programs set up to help employees lose weight or stop smoking cigarettes. [...] Family support programs involve help with parenting, childcare, and some programs allow employees to leave for family purposes.|$|E
5000|$|Nonlinear {{management}} (NLM) is a superset {{of management}} techniques and strategies that allows order to emerge by giving organizations {{the space to}} self-organize, evolve and adapt, encompassing Agile, [...] "evolutionary" [...] and [...] "lean" [...] approaches, <b>flextime,</b> time banking, {{as well as many}} others. Key aspects of NLM, including holism, evolutionary design or delivery, and self-organization are diametrically opposite to linear management thinking.|$|E
5000|$|Viewed {{from this}} perspective, things like casual dress codes, <b>flextime,</b> and {{telecommuting}} {{can be considered}} employee [...] "benefits" [...] {{whether or not they}} produce an expense to the organization offering them. If employees prefer to dress casually or to have flexible hours or to work from home they may be inclined to seek and less likely to leave employers that offer these things.|$|E
50|$|Robinson {{joined the}} firm of Debevoise & Plimpton in 1966, and became the firmâ€™s first female partner in 1976 and later head of the firmâ€™s Trusts and Estates division. In 1967, she {{established}} Debevoiseâ€™s <b>flextime</b> program for child-rearing attorneys, {{the first of its}} kind in New York. Among her clients, she has advised a number of wealthy individuals and organizations on trust law, including Yale University, Princeton University, and the Ford Foundation.|$|E
5000|$|Hochschild {{found in}} her {{research}} that although most working parents, particularly mothers, said [...] "family comes first", few of them considered adjusting their long working hours, even when their workplaces offered <b>flextime,</b> maternity leave, telework, or other [...] "family friendly" [...] policies. She concluded that the roles of home and work had reversed: work had become more attractive, offering a sense of belonging, while home had grown more stressful, becoming a dreaded place with too many demands.|$|E
50|$|Many modern {{workplaces}} {{are experimenting}} with accommodating changes in the workforce and {{the basic structure of}} scheduled work. <b>Flextime</b> allows office workers to shift their working time away from rush-hour traffic; for example, arriving at 10:00 am and leaving at 6:00 pm. Telecommuting permits employees to work from their homes or in satellite locations (not owned by the employer), eliminating or reducing long commute times in heavily populated areas. Zero-hour contracts establish work contracts without minimum-hour guarantees; workers are paid only for the hours they work.|$|E
50|$|On August 23, 2004, President George W. Bush and the Department of Labor {{proposed}} changes to regulations governing {{implementation of the}} law. According to one study, the changes would have had {{significant impact on the}} number of workers covered by overtime laws and have exempted several million additional workers. The Bush administration maintained that the practical impact on working Americans would be minimal and that the changes would help clarify an outdated regulation. In particular, the new rules would have allowed more companies to offer <b>flextime</b> to their workers in lieu of overtime.|$|E
50|$|Contingent {{contracts}} {{can be used}} in {{many types}} of settings such as work, school, home, etc. In regards to work, a common example of contingent contracts {{comes in the form of}} job negotiations. It usually involves the opportunity to discuss salary, position, promotion, etc. However, contingent contracts can often include negotiations regarding <b>flextime,</b> job sharing, responsibilities, etc. Although contingent contracts concerning employment packages are more the exception than the norm, these types of negotiations can be very successful, allowing both parties to walk away feeling very satisfied with the newly agreed upon arrangement (Krutzberg, Naquin 2011, p. 86-87).|$|E
5000|$|The Clean Air Campaign {{develops}} alternative work arrangements typically {{to augment}} an alternative commute program. Telework, compressed work weeks and <b>flextime</b> are all viable options employed {{to reduce the}} number of instances in which employees must commute to work during peak traffic hours or inclement weather conditions. This element of The Clean Air Campaign's program is unique in that it aims to assist with business continuity planning as much as transportation demand management and air pollution mitigation. [...] This program has also proved critical to employers whose workforces are affected by Atlanta's frequent road and highway closures.|$|E
5000|$|The Timex Beepwear Datalink series {{features}} wearable pagers, {{using the}} Timex datalink platform. These watches also function as electronic organisers. The Beepware series is patented {{and was the}} product of a joint Timex-Motorola effort which resulted in a new company called Beepwear Paging Products. The Beepwear marketing motto was: [...] "One beeping great watch". It was the first watch/pager able to receive alphanumeric messages. It operates in the 900 MHz band. Beepware also featured <b>FLEXtime</b> which, if supported by the service provider, could synchronise the time of the watch with that of the network. It could also automatically adjust to the time zone of the wearer.|$|E
5000|$|A theory {{frequently}} cited for why mothers earning lower wages than other women {{that is the}} fact that mothers tend to spend fewer hours in the workplace than non-mothers. [...] A report in 2014 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics stated that employed men worked 52 minutes more than employed women on the days they worked, and that this difference partly reflects women's greater likelihood of working part-time. Part-time work and <b>flextime</b> or more flexible arrangements are seen as hallmarks of the mommy track, since they point to women not being in the workplace full-time. However, this is changing as more peopleâ€”men and women alikeâ€”choose more flexible work arrangements that allow for more free time.|$|E
5000|$|During 2010 a local of the American Federation of Government Employees stated their {{unhappiness}} that {{a longstanding}} <b>flextime</b> program reduced under the George W. Bush administration {{had not been}} restored under the Obama administration. [...] Department officials said the program was modern and fair {{and that it was}} part of ongoing contract negotiations with the local.In August 2010, the Partnership for Public Service ranked the Department of Labor 23rd out of 31 large agencies in its annual [...] "Best Places to Work in the Federal Government" [...] list. In December 2010, then-Department of Labor Secretary Hilda Solis was named the Chair of the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, of which Labor has been a member since its beginnings in 1987.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, he was {{president}} of the Chinese Federation of Labor, one of three national labor unions in Taiwan at the time. In this position, he expressed opposition to <b>flextime</b> and boycotted multiple public hearings organized by the Council of Labor Affairs to discuss the topic. Lin staunchly supported a government proposal to mandate 84 hours of work over two weeks, instead of a 44-hour workweek. While serving on a panel convened by the Economic Development Advisory Conference, he fought to maintain a monthly minimum wage, and rejected a hourly wage proposal that was in discussion. Lin attended the Asian regional meeting of the International Labor Organization in August, the first time representatives of Taiwan were permitted to speak at an ILO gathering. Lin also worked for the Taiwan Railways Administration.|$|E

50|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1990s Hewitt had ventured abroad and offered benefit programs to corporations in the United Kingdom. The firm had brought in more than $250 million in revenues for 1990 and was ranked the fourth largest benefit management and consulting firm in the world, according to Business Insurance magazine. Yet many of Hewitt's clients were feeling the pinch of a struggling economy and inflation. As companies began looking for ways to bolster the bottom line, benefits were often the first place executives looked for a quick fix. In a time when few received raises and those who did received only cost-of-living increases, Hewitt started retooling retirement packages and healthcare benefits to keep its customers from making drastic changes. Of particular interest were retirement programs to help seniors withstand the effects of inflation. Hewitt also researched other benefit additions such as <b>flextime</b> scheduling, child- and elder-care benefits, and it compared HMOs (health management organizations) versus PPOs (preferred provider organizations).|$|E
5000|$|Players choose {{either a}} short or long game, {{and adjust the}} <b>Flextime</b> game board. For a short game, the board is folded so fewer spaces show. Each player throws a six-sided die to see who goes first. Then, the player rolls both the {{ordinary}} die and a customized eight-sided [...] "category die" [...] {{to see how far}} they move, and what challenge they face. The challenge can range from a trivia card question, a DVD challenge, ("My Play" [...] or [...] "All Play"), or they may have to draw a [...] "Buzz card" [...] (Cards are often renamed in special editions such as a [...] "Prime Directive" [...] card in Star Trek [...] "Scene It?"). If the roller wins the challenge, they can go again, but if they lose, the dice are handed to the next player. This process keeps going until someone hits the All Play to Win stop sign, in which that player must win one final All Play, in which everyone participates, in order to win. If not, they go to ring 3 of the zone called Final Cut. There they must answer 3 questions right. If that falls through, then on the next turn they only have to answer 2 questions, and then only 1 question if that fails. If a Final Cut challenge is won, then they win the game, and they get to watch a victory scene on the DVD.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Hewitt Associates {{established}} its first {{office in the}} UK (based in Hemel Hempstead) under its own name, after joint ventures with various insurance-led consultancies broke down, and thus began its expansion abroad, offering compensation consulting, actuarial services and tailored benefit programs particularly to US corporations in the United Kingdom. Its UK growth was rapid {{on the back of}} 'Big-Bang' and the expansion of US technology and services companies into the UK/Europe market. Hewitt pioneered flexible benefits in the UK. Within 3 years it has also established offices in Paris, the Netherlands and Germany with the UK acting as European headquarters. In the late 1980s it merged with Bacon & Woodrow (actuaries) in the UK. The firm had brought in more than $250 million in revenues for 1990 and was ranked the fourth largest benefit management and consulting firm in the world, according to Business Insurance magazine.

40|$|How {{many firms}} choose to adopt <b>flextime</b> without any policy intervention? Does {{promoting}} <b>flextime</b> improve social welfare? This paper addresses these two questions. We extend {{the model of}} bottleneck congestion to describe the case in which some firms in a city adopt <b>flextime.</b> The model also incorporates effects on urban productivity via agglomeration economy. Each firm chooses whether to adopt <b>flextime</b> or not, {{taking into account the}} trade-off between productivity and congestion. Equilibrium determines the number of firms adopting <b>flextime</b> and commuters â€™ departure patterns. We investigate the conditions in which <b>flextime</b> is adopted in equilibrium. Moreover, we demonstrate that multiple equilibria with respect to the number of firms adopting <b>flextime</b> may arise. The less efficient solution, the one without <b>flextime,</b> is likely to persist. We also examine the effect of a congestion toll on social welfare...|$|E
