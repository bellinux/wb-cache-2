5|$|Abraham Lincoln is not {{the only}} Lincoln ghost {{witnesses}} claim to have seen in the White House. Willie Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln's 11-year-old son, died in the White House of typhoid on February 20, 1862. Willie Lincoln's ghost was first seen in the White House by staff members of the Grant administration in the 1870s, but has appeared as recently as the 1960s (President Lyndon B. Johnson's college-age daughter, Lynda Bird Johnson Robb, saw the ghost and claims to <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> to him).|$|E

She <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> about pheasants, and <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> about grouse, <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> about moving the address in the House of Lords in some coming Session, and the great value of {{political}} alliances early in life, till the young peer began to think that Lady Cantrip was the nicest of women. Then after a short pause she changed the subject.|$|R

25|$|In United States prisons, {{medical costs}} for an ageing inmate could be above $100 per day as of July 2007, while typical inmates cost $33 per day. Most State DOCs report {{spending}} more than 10 percent of the annual budget on elderly care. That {{is expected to rise}} over the next 10–20 years. Some states <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> about releasing ageing inmates early.|$|E
25|$|On 9 April, the Ministry of Defence {{decided to}} ban {{personnel}} from selling their stories {{to the media}} until {{a review of the}} rules governing the issue is completed. Defence Secretary Des Browne said the review was aimed at making rules consistent across the armed forces. His announcement will not affect any of the 15 service members who already <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> to media, a Defence Ministry spokesman said.|$|E
25|$|The Galleanists {{knew that}} Salsedo {{had been held}} by the Bureau and might <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> to authorities. Rumors swirled in the anarchist {{community}} that Salsedo had made important disclosures concerning the bomb plot of June 2. The Galleanist plotters realized {{that they would have}} to go underground and dispose of any incriminating evidence. After their arrest, Sacco and Vanzetti were found to have correspondence with several Galleanists; one letter warned Sacco to destroy all mail after reading.|$|E

25|$|In a {{conversation}} between Kate Howard and Todd Manning on General Hospital, Erica is mentioned as someone else Todd could <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> to about the job he was offering to Kate, implying she survived the final episode of All My Children. On the June 20, 2013 episode of the Prospect Park version of All My Children, Opal Cortlandt tells Dimitri Marick, one of Erica's ex-husbands that Erica {{was out of town}} last seen getting on an airplane to some exotic location without saying when she would be back.|$|E
25|$|Shasta Hall, {{many people}} say, is haunted. Students <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> {{for years about}} a ghost in the building's theatre who {{disrupts}} play openings. Some think is a state building inspector who fell to his death in the building before it was completed. Now a popular coffee spot, the Roundhouse was controversial when {{it was built in}} 1969. Its design put off many people, and President Robert Johns apparently arranged for its construction without the approval of the CSU Board of Trustees. Sequoia Hall was originally constructed to have an attractive white cement finish, but the funding ran short. Today the building stands with plain concrete.|$|E
25|$|I {{suspect that}} I know {{more of the}} English class than any man in Britain. I never kept any reckoning: but I know that one year with another? — and less of late years than in earlier time? — I <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> to more than five in each year, giving {{more than a hundred}} and fifty specimens. Of this I am sure, that it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. Nobody knows how they swarm, except those to whom they {{naturally}} resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is bona fide, the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great many — the mass, indeed — are illiterate, and a great many waste their means, and are in or approaching penury. These discoverers despise one another.|$|E

500|$|As {{the largest}} {{submarine}} ever built, her performance will be carefully followed by naval designers and planners the world over. For many years strategists have speculated on {{the possibilities of}} tankers, cargo ships and transports that could navigate under water.

500|$|... {{some little}} {{inconsistency}} in the defense, {{and the main}} part of it is this: There will be conversations here where Mr. Glasser wasn't present, where people have seen Mr. Kretske and they <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> about, that they gave money to take care of Glasser, that is not binding on Mr. Glasser, and there is a divergency there, and Mr. Glasser feels that if I would represent Mr. Kretske the jury would get an idea that they are together [...] [...] [...] [...]|$|E

500|$|Instead {{of hunting}} big game abroad as he usually did {{over the winter}} months, Gordon-Cumming {{remained}} in Britain, and spent time in London and at his Scottish estate. He was also seen {{in the presence of}} an American heiress, Florence Garner, and the two became engaged. On 27 December he received an anonymous message from Paris that read: [...] "they are beginning to talk much here of... your sad adventure... They <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> too much in England. He sent the message to Williams and asked him to let the prince know the contents.|$|E
500|$|... in September 1939, after Germany invaded Poland, and World War II began, Borah mourned, [...] "Lord, if I {{could only}} <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> to Hitler—all {{this might have}} been averted." [...] This was said to William Kinsey Hutchinson, then International News Service's Washington Bureau Chief. Hutchinson {{indicated}} that Borah confided this [...] "in words that ran like a prayer." [...] McKenna noted, [...] "It was fortuitous that the march of events prevented Borah from joining those pacifists and liberals... who trudged up the hill to Berchtesgaden to lay before the Fuehrer their plans for world peace".|$|E
500|$|... "Blah Blah Blah" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{recording}} artist Kesha from her debut album, Animal (2010). Produced by Benny Blanco, and co-written by Kesha, Blanco, Neon Hitch and Sean Foreman, it was released as the album's second single on February 19, 2010, and features 3OH!3. Initial writing of the song took place when Kesha, Blanco, Hitch and Foreman were discussing which sex talked more and which one was more [...] "obnoxious." [...] The song is a midtempo electropop song that speaks {{of men in the}} same way that they <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> about women in the music industry. The lyrics depict a woman who would rather have sex than listen to a man speak and features blatant come-ons throughout the song.|$|E

500|$|Beadle {{later wrote}} to his fellow High Court judge Benjamin Goldin {{that he thought he}} had [...] "saved the situation" [...] by going to London, [...] having persuaded Wilson to give some ground on the terms for the Royal Commission, but his trip alarmed the pro-UDI camp in the Rhodesian Cabinet, who feared that Beadle might be {{carrying}} a message to the Governor Sir Humphrey Gibbs telling him to [...] parliament. Smith and his Cabinet declared independence on 11 November 1965, while Beadle was at Lusaka Airport on his way home. Smith later rejected the suggestion that Beadle could have had anything significant to tell them on his return, saying that [...] "the only thing that Beadle could have done when he got back was to <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> us out of insisting on our questions".|$|E
500|$|McKenna {{saw more}} than Borah {{becoming}} an antique {{in his own}} time, she saw damage inflicted by his positions: [...] "time was to demonstrate the utter bankruptcy of the narrow nationalistic policy which the irreconcilables decreed and to which the Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover administrations submitted with such disastrous results." [...] Borah's comment regretting {{that he could not}} <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> to Hitler has been repeatedly cited as evidence of naiveté in those who believe in the power of pure diplomacy. Conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer has referred to the statement in at least three of his columns, making an analogy to negotiating with China in 1989, with North Korea in 1994 and with Iran in 2006, and it was cited disparagingly in a 2006 speech by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to {{his role in the}} television series, Dale's comic book counterpart is among the longest surviving characters in the series, and he enters into a sexual relationship with Andrea. Kirkman asserted that it was necessary for writers to distance the development of Dale's television character from that in the comic: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> many times how much I like the difference between the comics and the show. There are going to be big plot lines that we may not necessarily get to, like the romance between Dale and Andrea. If you think you really want to read that story line, that's available in the comics, and I highly recommend you pick those up. The show {{is always going to be}} a different animal and the decision to kill Dale off was a big one and it wasn't one that was made lightly." ...|$|E
