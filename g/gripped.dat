5|$|Anti-Communist {{sentiment}} <b>gripped</b> the United States {{during the}} Cold War beginning in 1946. Federal investigations caused many persons with Communist or left-leaning affiliations {{to lose their}} jobs, become blacklisted, or be jailed. During the Cold War, although the United States collectively ignored {{the civil rights of}} Communists, other civil liberties—such as due process in law and separation of church and state—continued to be reinforced and even expanded.|$|E

50|$|Matched <b>grip</b> (also {{known as}} {{parallel}} <b>grip)</b> {{is a method}} of holding drum sticks and mallets to play percussion instruments. In the matched <b>grip</b> each hand holds its stick in the same way, whereas in the traditional <b>grip,</b> each hand holds the stick differently. Almost all commonly used matched <b>grips</b> are overhand <b>grips.</b> Specific forms of the <b>grip</b> are French <b>grip,</b> German <b>grip,</b> and American <b>grip.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are two {{categories}} of <b>grips</b> used in snare technique: matched <b>grip,</b> in which both hands hold the sticks in an overhand <b>grip,</b> and traditional <b>grip,</b> in which one hand uses an overhand <b>grip</b> and the other an underhand <b>grip.</b> Traditional <b>grip</b> is almost exclusively used on snare drum, and concert bass drum, while matched <b>grip</b> is used on all percussion instruments. Traditional <b>grip</b> is also primarily used in drum corps style marching environments, such as Drum Corps International.|$|R
5|$|James Richard Ellis {{has argued}} that the incest taboo is {{fundamental}} to a civilized society. Building on Sigmund Freud's theories and psychoanalysis this is shown in Ovid's version of the myth of Myrrha.

5|$|Barnes <b>gripped</b> the bat {{very low}} on the handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
5|$|Carroll's tenure {{was plagued}} by disasters, both natural and man-made. Flooding struck {{in the eastern part}} of the state and in the state capitol of Frankfort. Extreme cold <b>gripped</b> the entire state in 1977 and 1978, {{including}} the Great Blizzard of 1978. Two mine explosions in Letcher County killed 26 people, and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire claimed 165 lives. Many of these disasters led to stricter enforcement of safety laws. Carroll formed the Department of Housing, Buildings, and Construction and strengthened the state fire marshal's office.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Whig Party in the early 1850s, many former Whigs joined the Know Nothing, or American, Party, and Charles S. Morehead was elected governor from that party in 1855. Sectarian tensions <b>gripped</b> the state in the lead-up to the Civil War, and while the majority of Kentuckians favored the preservation of the Union above all else, a self-constituted group of Confederate sympathizers met at Russellville and formed a Confederate government for the state. While this provisional government never displaced the elected government in Frankfort, two men served as Confederate governors of Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Potbelly monuments are {{generally}} crude in-the-round sculptures of extremely fat human figures; {{they are usually}} seated cross-legged and have enormous swollen stomachs <b>gripped</b> in the figure's arms and legs.

5|$|A {{dense fog}} helped to cloud {{the advance of}} St. Hilaire's French division, but as they went up the slope the legendary 'Sun of Austerlitz' ripped the mist apart and {{encouraged}} them forward. Russian soldiers and commanders {{on top of the}} heights were stunned to see so many French troops coming towards them. Allied commanders moved some of the delayed detachments of the fourth column into this bitter struggle. Over an hour of fighting destroyed much of this unit. The other men from the second column, mostly inexperienced Austrians, also participated in the struggle and swung the numbers against one of the best fighting forces in the French army, eventually forcing them to withdraw down the slopes. However, <b>gripped</b> by desperation, St. Hilaire's men struck hard once more and bayoneted the Allies out of the heights. To the north, General Vandamme's division attacked an area called Staré Vinohrady ("Old Vineyards") and, through talented skirmishing and deadly volleys, broke several Allied battalions.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, {{after the}} end of the war, Justice participated in the French naval {{intervention}} in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea, and was based in Sevastopol. On 19 April, a mutiny <b>gripped</b> the French fleet, starting on the battleship France, the squadron flagship. At one point during the mutiny, the crew of Justice briefly flew the red flag, though they remained relatively calm. The situation worsened after a group of Greek soldiers fired into a crowd of demonstrators ashore; one French sailor was killed and another five were injured. Justices crew was enraged, and began discussing opening fire on the Greek battleship Kilkis, moored nearby. Justices captain ordered his ship's guns disabled by removing their breech blocks to prevent an attack. The situation was eventually defused by returning the French squadron back to France, one of the mutineers' primary demands. Ultimately, Justice was stricken from the naval register in 1922 and sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Shostakovich {{acquired}} {{a book of}} Jewish folk songs, and from this he composed the song cycle From Jewish Folk Poetry. He initially wrote eight songs that were meant to represent the hardships of being Jewish in the Soviet Union. However in order to disguise this, Shostakovich ended up adding three more songs meant to demonstrate the great life Jews had under the Soviet regime. Despite his efforts to hide the real meaning in the work, the Union of Composers refused to approve his music in 1949 {{under the pressure of}} the anti-Semitism that <b>gripped</b> the country. From Jewish Folk Poetry could not be performed until after Stalin’s death in March 1953, along with all the other works that were forbidden.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, {{financial}} crisis <b>gripped</b> the New York City {{government and the}} troubles spread to the city's institutions, including NYU. Feeling the pressures of imminent bankruptcy, NYU President James McNaughton Hester negotiated {{the sale of the}} University Heights campus to the City University of New York, which occurred in 1973. In 1973, the New York University School of Engineering and Science merged into Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, which eventually merged into NYU in 2014 forming the present Tandon School of Engineering. After the sale of the Bronx campus, University College merged with Washington Square College. In the 1980s, under the leadership of President John Brademas, NYU launched a billion-dollar campaign that was spent almost entirely on updating facilities. The campaign was set to complete in 15 years, but ended up being completed in 10. In 2003 President John Sexton launched a $2.5 billion campaign for funds to be spent especially on faculty and financial aid resources.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike Poma's <b>grips,</b> Doppelmayr <b>grips</b> are double {{position}} <b>grips.</b> When {{the chair}} enters a terminal, the angled roller is pushed {{down by a}} metal strip, which opens a <b>grip</b> jaw. The jaw remains open until the chair reattaches to the cable upon departing the terminal. <b>Grip</b> clamping force is measured {{just prior to the}} double position <b>grips</b> reattaching to the haul rope while a carrier (chair) is exiting the terminal, in contrast to Poma's <b>grips,</b> in which <b>grip</b> force can be measured as the <b>grip</b> travels through the contour. Insufficient <b>grip</b> force triggers an alarm and brings the lift to a halt before the carrier reaches the first breakover tower after the terminal. Because of this design, most Doppelmayr detachable lifts are designed to allow operation in reverse. This allows a <b>grip</b> force-alarmed <b>grip</b> and carrier to be backed into the terminal for inspection or removal.|$|R
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1956 the town came to {{national}} and worldwide attention, when Dr John Bodkin Adams, a general practitioner serving the town's wealthier patients, was arrested {{for the murder of}} an elderly widow.

Figures of up to 400 murders were reported in British and foreign newspapers, but after a controversial trial at the Old Bailey which <b>gripped</b> the nation for 17 days in March 1957, Adams was found not guilty. He was struck off for four years but resumed his practice in Eastbourne in 1961. According to Scotland Yard's archives, he is thought to have killed up to 163 patients in the Eastbourne area.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey {{spent the}} next several years in the peacetime routine of the Atlantic Fleet, with various {{training}} maneuvers and gunnery practice in the Atlantic and Caribbean. During this period, she spent a year out of commission at Boston from 2 May 1910 to 15 July 1911, and in the summers of 1912 and 1913, she conducted training cruises for midshipmen from the United States Naval Academy. The ship was deployed to the Caribbean to protect American interests as the Mexican Revolution worsened in late 1913. On 21 April 1914, the United States occupied Veracruz {{in the aftermath of the}} Tampico Affair. On 13 August, New Jersey departed Mexican waters and steamed to Santo Domingo, where unrest <b>gripped</b> both the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
