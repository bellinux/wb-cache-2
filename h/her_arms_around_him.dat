25|$|According to the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations, Kennedy {{was waving}} to the crowds {{on his right}} with his right arm upraised {{on the side of}} the limo when a shot entered his upper back, {{penetrated}} his neck and slightly damaged a spinal vertebra and the top of his right lung. The bullet exited his throat nearly centerline just beneath his larynx and nicked the left side of his suit tie knot. He raised his elbows and clenched his fists in front of his face and neck, then leaned forward and left. Mrs. Kennedy, facing him, then put <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> in concern.|$|E
500|$|After President Nixon {{told his}} family he would resign {{the office of}} the presidency, she replied, [...] "But why?" [...] She {{contacted}} White House curator Clement Conger to cancel any further development of a new official china pattern from the Lenox China Company, and began supervising the packing of the family's personal belongings. On August 7, 1974, the family met in the solarium of the White House for their last dinner. Pat {{sat on the edge of}} a couch and held her chin high, a sign of tension to her husband. When the president walked in, she threw <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> kissed him, and said, [...] "We're all very proud of you, Daddy." [...] Later Pat Nixon said of the photographs taken that evening, [...] "Our hearts were breaking and there we are smiling." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{crossed over}} {{to the back of}} his chair and put <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You think Mr Blake is silly. He is a silly young man, I allow; but Mr Hall {{has been}} very civil. As I am to go there for a week, {{you might as well}} take me." [...] As she spoke she put <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> caressing him.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993, after {{a lengthy}} and highly publicized jury trial {{stemming}} from his involvement with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and its secret acquisition of First American Bankshares Inc., Altman was acquitted. Carter was seen on the TV news with <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> declaring, [...] "Not guilty! Not guilty!" [...] to the gathered reporters.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>arms</b> {{tightened}} <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> He {{looked down}} at her with a peculiar helplessness. Their light weight seemed to him like a chain of iron weighing him down! down! down! ...|$|R
60|$|She laughed suddenly, with a wild {{catch in}} her voice, and flung <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|For a {{few moments}} McMurdo and the girl stood in silence. Then she threw <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|But Olive put <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and coaxed him for her sake to let {{the matter}} rest. And, finally, the captain, grumblingly, assented.|$|E
60|$|He stooped down, and <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> closed <b>around</b> <b>him</b> like a soft yoke. But {{he kissed}} her {{forehead}} so lightly that she scarcely {{realized that this was}} almost his first caress.|$|R
60|$|The {{poor woman}} had {{suffered}} too much already to shrink from this last crushing blow. But she walked quietly {{to his side}} without a word or cry, knelt, placed <b>her</b> loving <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> and I left them so together.|$|R
50|$|He is {{even said}} to create social vignettes with the toys. For example, {{the day after}} he first allowed his owner to put <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> he placed a large bear with its <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> a smaller frog. Dr. Barbara Smuts, a {{professor}} of psychology and specialist in animal behavior at the University of Michigan who studied Donnie and captured his activities on video, suggests that these behaviors may be linked to self-entertainment, or to past experiences such as his time spent in a shelter for a year with only a single toy. In her view, there have not been enough examples of behavior like Donnie's, to decide scientifically what they may mean.|$|R
6000|$|... (Going to Tommy, and {{bending down}} with <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.)</b> No, Tommy. Mama {{has to go}} to that horrid dinner to-night. But to-morrow we'll play.|$|E
6000|$|She {{rushed into}} his embrace, and {{throwing}} <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> {{buried her face}} upon his breast. 'Alaric, Alaric, my husband! my love, my best, my own, my only love!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you dear ninny!" [...] Dora cried, {{throwing}} <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> {{and hugging}} him. [...] "Then you saw it, too! I thought something was the matter, you were acting so strangely." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{he climbed}} the steep, stony steps {{to the door of}} the Baron's house, old Ursela came running down to meet him. She flung <b>her</b> {{withered}} <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and hugged him close to her. [...] "My little child," [...] she cried, and then fell to sobbing as though her heart would break.|$|R
60|$|Willie's silent weeping {{turned to}} noise, {{and the two}} little girls, with the fresh ribbons in their hair, joined him. Tom's face was drawn and white, though the smitten cheek still blazed, and Saxon wanted to put <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> comfortingly <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> yet dared not. He bent over his wife.|$|R
60|$|The {{crowd was}} in a tumult. The men of rank and dignity, who stood more {{immediately}} around the clergyman, were so taken by surprise, and so perplexed as to the purport of what they saw--unable to receive the explanation which most readily presented itself, or to imagine any other--that they remained silent and inactive spectators of the judgement which Providence seemed about to work. They beheld the minister, leaning on Hester's shoulder, and supported by <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> approach the scaffold, and ascend its steps; while still the little hand of the sin-born child was clasped in his. Old Roger Chillingworth followed, as one intimately connected with the drama of guilt and sorrow {{in which they had}} all been actors, and well entitled, therefore to be present at its closing scene.|$|R
6000|$|He {{had a fit}} of coughing. Winifred passed <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> {{and held}} him up. [...] "If you stay," [...] she whispered to Hefferom, [...] "you will kill him. He ought not to speak ever a sentence." ...|$|E
60|$|Instantly Joan saw it--saw in him {{the return}} of the other and better Kells, how {{stricken}} with remorse. She slipped to her knees and clasped <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> He tried to break her hold, but she held on.|$|E
60|$|There {{was now a}} rush {{against the}} doors of the house. The people sent up a hoarse cry. At this instant the lieutenant-governor's daughter, whom he had {{supposed}} to be in a place of safety, ran into the room and threw <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> She had returned by a private entrance.|$|E
60|$|Feverish and excited, {{he tried}} {{in vain to}} sleep again; and after an hour's tossing, rose and dressed, and started for a bathe on his beloved old pebble ridge. As he passed his mother's door, he could not help looking in. The dim light of morning showed him the bed; but its pillow had not been pressed that night. His mother, in her long white night-dress, was {{kneeling}} {{at the other end of}} the chamber at her prie-dieu, absorbed in devotion. Gently he slipped in without a word, and knelt down at her side. She turned, smiled, passed <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> and went on silently with her prayers. Why not? They were for him, and he knew it, and prayed also; and his prayers were for her, and for poor lost John Oxenham, and all his vanished crew.|$|R
60|$|For {{a single}} instant {{she turned her}} set face to the window with a sudden convulsive movement, as if she would have called him back, {{but at the same}} moment the {{opposite}} door creaked and her brother slipped into the room. Whether a quick memory of the deserter's entrance at that door a year ago had crossed her mind, whether there was some strange suggestion in his mud-stained garments and weak deprecating smile, or whether it was the outcome of some desperate struggle within her, there was that in her face that changed his smile into a frightened cry for pardon, as he ran and fell on his knees at her feet. But even as he did so her stern look vanished, and with <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> she bent over him and mingled her tears with his.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the last}} day of her life, Kupcinet had dinner with future Lost in Space cast member Mark Goddard and his wife, Marcia Rogers Goddard, at their house on Coldwater Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills (near Mulholland Drive). She was due there at 6:30 pm, but arrived an hour late by taxicab. The couple said Kupcinet only toyed with her food during the meal. Marcia Goddard told two {{officers}} from the L.A. County Sheriff's Office that during dinner with Kupcinet [...] "... her lips seemed numb. Her voice was funny. She moved her head at odd angles." [...] The Goddards also noticed that her pupils were constricted. Mark Goddard told authorities that he confronted Kupcinet about her altered state during the meal, and she began to cry, putting <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> At one point during the meal, Kupcinet told her friends an unsubstantiated story about a baby that had been abandoned on her doorstep earlier that day. At 8:30 pm, a taxicab arrived to take her home, and she promised to telephone the Goddards soon.|$|R
60|$|He {{reached for}} his hat {{and started for the}} door. He did not offer to kiss her--he never did on going out--but on this night she dared to kiss him, {{throwing}} <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and compelling him to bend down to her face. She looked quite small against the massive bulk of the man.|$|E
60|$|His {{departure}} was so {{sudden and}} so speedy {{that he was}} down the first flight of stairs before the inspector started. Arnold, who was nearest the door, made a movement as though to follow, but Ruth threw <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> The policeman who had been examining the other room rushed past them both.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wetzel, wait, for God's sake, wait!" [...] screamed Nell. She {{had risen}} at Zane's call, and now saw the deadly resolve in the hunter's eyes. Fearlessly she flung herself {{in front of}} him; bravely she risked her life before his mad rush; frantically she threw <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and clung to his hands desperately.|$|E
60|$|The Magician uttered such a wild {{cry that}} Ojo jumped {{away and the}} Patchwork Girl sprang after him and clasped <b>her</b> stuffed <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> in terror. The Glass Cat snarled and hid under the table, {{and so it was}} that when the {{powerful}} Liquid of Petrifaction was spilled it fell only upon the wife of the Magician and the uncle of Ojo. With these two the charm worked promptly. They stood motionless and stiff as marble statues, in exactly the positions they were in when the Liquid struck them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Mary! To {{others he}} is the Christ, the Saviour of mankind, setting forth upon his mighty mission to redeem the world. To loving Mary Mother, he is her son: the baby she has suckled at her breast, the little one she has crooned to sleep upon her lap, whose little cheek has lain against her heart, whose little feet have made sweet music through the poor home at Bethany: he is her boy, her child; she would wrap <b>her</b> mother's <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and hold him safe against all the world, against even heaven itself.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>arms</b> would fold <b>around</b> <b>him</b> as {{she sank}} to the ground. Perhaps he was already waiting for her somewhere--in one of those mystic worlds where the soul might shake itself free from this weary burden of human passions and sorrows. Her lips parted in a {{wonderful}} smile. She raised the glass! ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{sight of}} Mr. Burns {{and his wife}} at the gate moved Harold deeply. Mrs. Burns came hurrying out: [...] "You blessed boy! Get right down and let me hug you," [...] and as he leaped down she put <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> {{as if he were}} her own son, and Harold's eyes smarted with tears.|$|E
60|$|The {{door closed}} behind him. They heard the shrill summons of the bell, {{the arrival of the}} lift, the clanging of the iron gate, and its {{subsequent}} descent. Then Beatrice turned her head. Philip was still smoking serenely, standing {{with his back to the}} mantelpiece, his hands in his pockets. She rose and threw <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|It was a {{long time}} before the Countess came to herself, and when she did so, a {{considerable}} change seemed to have taken place in her emotions. She flung <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> and with gasps of fear abjectly kissed him many times, at last bursting into tears. She had never wept in this scene before.|$|E
6000|$|The Abencerrage {{hung his}} lance, and shield, and scimitar against the wall, and then {{followed}} the duenna, with silent steps, up a winding stair-case, {{to the apartment}} of Xarisa. Vain would be the attempt to describe the raptures of that meeting. Time flew too swiftly, and the Abencerrage had nearly forgotten, until too late, his promise to return a prisoner to the Alcayde of Allora. The recollection of {{it came to him}} with a pang, and suddenly awoke him from his dream of bliss. Xarisa saw his altered looks, and heard with alarm his stifled sighs; but her countenance brightened, when she heard the cause. [...] "Let not thy spirit be cast down," [...] said she, throwing <b>her</b> white <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> [...] "I have the keys of my father's treasures; send ransom more than enough to satisfy the Christian, and remain with me." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{sudden change}} had crept into his tone {{before the last}} sentence; and before it had died away, the priest and the man by the bedside had leaped to their feet in horror. He whom they had thought too weak to stir was sitting bolt upright in bed, his eyes blazing and his hand extended. There was a line of fire, a loud report, and then a single cry of agony. The man who had leaned over {{the foot of the}} bed lay on the ground just as he had fallen, shot dead through the heart, and a child, dark-skinned and thin, who had rushed in at the sound of the report, was sobbing passionately with <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> wound <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> Across the bed, still {{grasping}} the pistol, but with his hands hanging helplessly down, lay the man who had fired the shot. The effort had killed him.|$|R
50|$|In {{the upper}} register, the central figures are the four-armed Shiva {{and to his}} left hand side, Parvati, who clings to her husband with <b>her</b> two <b>arms</b> flung <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> Shiva is calm, comforting his terrified consort, {{embracing}} her {{with one or two}} arms. Shiva wears a jata-mukuta (a headdress formed of piled, matted hair), while Parvati's hair is arranged in a bun. In an upper arm, Shiva holds a trishula (trident) and his lower right arm makes the abhayamudra (fear-not gesture). The couple may be seated on a lotus pedestal or rest their feet on it. In some cases, Parvati is seated on Shiva's left lap. Sometimes, he may cuddle her breast or touch her chin lovingly.|$|R
