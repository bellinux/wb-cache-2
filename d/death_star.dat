5|$|The Falcon {{journeys}} to the Rebel base at Yavin IV, {{where the}} Rebels analyze the <b>Death</b> <b>Star</b> plans {{and find a}} weakness. Luke joins the assault team while Han collects his reward for the rescue and prepares to leave. The Rebel fighters attack the <b>Death</b> <b>Star</b> but suffer heavy losses during the assault. During his run, Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice telling him to use the Force, and he turns off his targeting computer. Vader appears with his own group of fighters, {{and is about to}} fire at Luke's starfighter when Han arrives in the Falcon and attacks Vader and his men, sending Vader's ship off into space.

5|$|Subsequently, Katarn met Jan Ors (Julie Eccles), a Human Rebel working {{undercover}} as {{a double}} {{agent in the}} Empire. Ors uncovered the real information about Katarn's parents' death; that the Empire was behind it. The Empire eventually discovered that Ors {{was working for the}} Rebels and she was taken prisoner. Katarn helped her escape, thus ending his career with the Empire. He soon became a mercenary and, due to his hatred of the Empire for killing his parents, he began to take on jobs from the Rebel Alliance. Dark Forces begins with Katarn being recruited by the Rebel Alliance to recover the plans to the <b>Death</b> <b>Star,</b> a heavily armed space station capable of destroying an entire planet. The Alliance uses the plans to find a weakness in, and subsequently destroy, the <b>Death</b> <b>Star.</b>|$|E
5|$|Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids {{travel to}} Mos Eisley {{to find a}} pilot {{to take them to}} Alderaan. At a local cantina they hire {{smuggler}} Han Solo (Peter) and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca (Brian), who agree to take them with their ship, the Millennium Falcon. The group is soon spotted by stormtroopers and they flee into space, evading the pursuing Star Destroyers before jumping into hyperspace. Leia is imprisoned on the <b>Death</b> <b>Star,</b> where commanding officer Grand Moff Tarkin (Adam West) has Alderaan destroyed. The Millennium Falcon exits hyperspace and is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam and brought into its hangar bay.

5|$|Development of Dark Forces {{was led by}} Daron Stinnett. The {{programming}} was led by Ray Gresko, and {{the graphics}} and storyline by Justin Chin. Production began in September 1993, {{at a time when}} the first-person shooter genre was very popular. The idea of creating a first-person shooter in the Star Wars universe was inspired by fan mods of Doom which had levels set on the <b>Death</b> <b>Star.</b> The developers of Dark Forces wanted to adapt the FPS format into an adventure game. To do this they introduced puzzles and strategy, along with a Star Wars plot. Originally Luke Skywalker was intended to be the main character in the game, however the developers realized that this would add constraints to gameplay and storyline. Instead a new character, Kyle Katarn, was created.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Shaw {{was chosen}} for the small but crucial role of unmasked and dying Anakin Skywalker in Return of the Jedi, {{the third and final}} film in the {{original}} Star Wars trilogy. Although David Prowse played the costumed scenes and James Earl Jones voiced Darth Vader, just as they had in the first two films, Shaw was cast in a single scene with Mark Hamill, during the moment aboard <b>Death</b> <b>Star</b> II when Luke Skywalker unmasks his dying father. Since the scene was unquestionably the emotional climax of the film, the casting crew sought an experienced actor for the role.|$|E
5|$|Senators Organa, Mon Mothma, and Garm Bel Iblis meet on Corellia {{to plan a}} {{rebellion}} against the Empire, but are interrupted when Darth Vader arrives and arrests them and Kota.

5|$|The Undiscovered Countrys Cold War allegory and {{references}} to literary history were recognized among researchers and cultural historians. According to scholar Larry Kreitzer, The Undiscovered Country has more references to William Shakespeare {{than any other}} Star Trek work until at least 1996. The title itself alludes to Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1. Meyer had originally intended The Wrath of Khan to be called The Undiscovered Country. Whereas the undiscovered country referred to in Hamlet (and its intended meaning in The Wrath of Khan) is <b>death,</b> <b>Star</b> Trek VIs use of the phrase refers to a future where Klingons and humans coexist in peace.|$|E

5|$|The game's central {{location}} is the Mos Eisley Cantina, a spaceport {{bar on the}} planet Tatooine. At the counter, the player may use their Lego studs to purchase characters, vehicles, gameplay hints and extras, or activate cheat codes. In a small area outside the cantina, players may view collected vehicles. The game is broken into levels, which are accessed from the cantina; each film is represented by six levels, representing key locations and scenes in that film. The locations include Hoth, Bespin, Dagobah, Tatooine, the <b>Death</b> <b>Star,</b> and Endor. The game also features bonus levels. During levels, the player defeats enemies, builds objects out of Lego bricks and drives vehicles, Certain levels are played entirely while piloting vehicles, including a TIE fighter, a Snowspeeder, and the Millennium Falcon. Levels must first be played in Story Mode. This unlocks the next level {{as well as a}} Free Play mode for the recently completed level. Gameplay is identical in the two modes. However, Story Mode restricts playable characters to those followed in the film scenes the levels are based on, while Free Play offers all those unlocked. Levels can be replayed in either mode to collect studs and secret items.|$|E

Leland Chee originally created the third <b>Death</b> <b>Star</b> to explain why a <b>Death</b> <b>Star</b> is present on the Star Tours ride when both of the stations in the movies were destroyed. The station being built near the Forest Moon of Endor like the second <b>Death</b> <b>Star</b> before it is similar to an original concept for Return of the Jedi, where two Death Stars would have been built near Had Abbadon (then the Imperial capital world). The Habitation spheres, based on the Imperials' suspicious claims that they were designed strictly for peaceful purposes, were suggested by some fans to have been the origin for the <b>Death</b> <b>Star</b> III. This was later revealed to be the case in Part 2 of the StarWars.com Blog series The Imperial Warlords: Despoilers of an Empire. In the Star Wars Legends game Tiny <b>Death</b> <b>Star,</b> a random HoloNet entry states that one of the residents of the <b>Death</b> <b>Star</b> is simply staying there until he can afford to stay at the third <b>Death</b> <b>Star.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{anthology}} film Rogue One {{focuses on}} a band of Rebels stealing {{the plans for the}} first <b>Death</b> <b>Star</b> prior to the events of A New Hope. The <b>Death</b> <b>Star</b> project was overseen by Orson Krennic, the Director of Advanced Weapons Research for the Imperial Military. Under Krennic's supervision, the project was beset by constant delays, and he forcibly recruited weapons designer Galen Erso (the father of Jyn Erso, the movie's main protagonist) to complete the design; nevertheless, it was another fifteen years before the <b>Death</b> <b>Star</b> was operational. The Death Star's primary laser was powered by kyber crystals mined from the desert moon of Jedha, and is first used to destroy Jedha City both as a response to a violent insurgency on the planet, and as a display of the Death Star's operational status to restore the Empire's confidence in the project. Grand Moff Tarkin assumes control over the <b>Death</b> <b>Star</b> while Krennic investigates security breaches in the design project. It is subsequently revealed that Galen discreetly sabotaged the design by building a vulnerability into the reactor. This is the same vulnerability that Luke Skywalker takes advantage of during the events of A New Hope. After the <b>Death</b> <b>Star</b> plans are stolen from the Scarif vault, Tarkin fires the <b>Death</b> <b>Star</b> laser on the base killing Krennic, as well as Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor.|$|E
