The Bible says at Exodus chapter 20 that we can’t have any other gods before Jehovah God.” To my {{surprise}} she just hugged me and said what a dear girl I was. Well, when the flag ceremony time came, I did not join in the salute."

Jehovah's Witnesses published the booklet Loyalty, making the matter an official doctrine of the faith before the end of 1935. Witnesses hired teachers and set up “Kingdom schools” to continue their children’s education.|$|E

60|$|With <b>heart</b> <b>pounding</b> mightily, {{and face}} set and stern, {{he left his}} room and began {{descending}} the stairway, uncertain still {{of the way in}} which he should meet her.|$|E

60|$|Duane waited. The moments dragged endlessly. His <b>heart</b> <b>pounded.</b> Longstreth entered, {{turned up}} the light, and, taking a box of cigars from the table, he carried it out.|$|R
60|$|Lee Barton's <b>heart</b> <b>pounded</b> up. Never {{a mention}} of losing herself. This, then, was love, and all real love, proved true--the great love that forgot self in the loved one.|$|R
60|$|Scarcely {{knowing what}} he did, he walked towards the Earl like a machine, his <b>heart</b> <b>pounding</b> within him and a great humming in his ears. As he drew near, the nobleman {{stopped for a moment}} and stared at him, and Myles, as in a dream, kneeled, and {{presented}} the letter. The Earl took it in his hand, turned it this way and that, looked first at the bearer, then at the packet, and then at the bearer again.|$|E
60|$|Now the {{politicians}} were too wise {{to leave the}} town filled with drunks from the water-front of Oakland. When train time came, there was a round-up of the saloons. Already I was feeling {{the impact of the}} whisky. Nelson and I were hustled out of a saloon, and found ourselves in the very last rank of a disorderly parade. I struggled along heroically, my correlations breaking down, my legs tottering under me, my head swimming, my <b>heart</b> <b>pounding,</b> my lungs panting for air.|$|E
6000|$|Then a swish in the wheat, a soft thud, very low, unmistakably came to Kurt's ear. He listened, {{turning his}} ear to the wind. Presently he heard it again--a sound {{relating}} both to wheat and earth. In a hot flash he divined that some one had thrown fairly heavy bodies into the wheat-fields. Phosphorus cakes! Kurt held his breath while he peered down the gloomy road, his <b>heart</b> <b>pounding,</b> his hands gripping the rifle. And when he descried a dim form stealthily coming toward him he yelled, [...] "Halt!" ...|$|E
60|$|My <b>heart</b> <b>pounded</b> {{within my}} breast as I {{advanced}} toward her--tears {{came to my}} eyes--and the words that would have poured forth in a perfect torrent choked in my throat as I opened my arms and took into them once more the woman I loved--Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium.|$|R
60|$|My <b>heart</b> <b>pounded</b> {{within my}} bosom until I looked about me in embarrassment, so sure was I that all within the room must hear. My arms ached to enfold {{once more the}} divine form of her whose eternal youth and undying beauty were but outward manifestations of a perfect soul.|$|R
40|$|It’s a Sunday night, {{sometime}} after 9 pm, I (Shady) am in my car, {{parked in front}} of Aldi in Wollongong. The lot is vacant, the sky black and threatening. I’ve been waiting, checking my phone, glancing up the street. A siren blares out behind me, and my <b>heart</b> <b>pounds.</b> I check the rear-view mirror: just a fire engine...|$|R
60|$|Her {{hand was}} still in his as he rose and they were very close, and the man was still flushed with the contact of her body since he had carried her from the throne room of O-Tar. He felt his <b>heart</b> <b>pounding</b> in his breast and the hot blood surging through his veins as he looked at her {{beautiful}} face, with its downcast eyes and the half-parted lips that he would have given a kingdom to possess, and then he swept her to him and as he crushed her against his breast his lips smothered hers with kisses.|$|E
60|$|Lane rose to {{his feet}} with his <b>heart</b> <b>pounding,</b> and a strange sense of expectancy. His little sister! Never during the endless months of drudgery, strife and conflict, and agony, had he {{forgotten}} Lorna. Not duty, nor patriotism, had forced him to enlist in the army before the draft. It had been an ideal which he imagined he shared with the millions of American boys who entered the service. Too deep ever to be spoken of! The barbarous and simian Hun, with his black record against Belgian, and French women, should never set foot on American soil.|$|E
60|$|She could but {{hope that}} he had {{continued}} on up wind and in this direction she moved, her <b>heart</b> <b>pounding</b> in terror against her ribs, her eyes glancing first {{in one direction and}} then another. She had reached the edge of a clearing when two things happened--she caught sight of Tarzan bending over a dead deer and at the same instant a deafening roar sounded almost beside her. It terrified her beyond description, but it brought no paralysis of fear. Instead it galvanized her into instant action with the result that Pan-at-lee swarmed up the nearest tree to the very loftiest branch that would sustain her weight. Then she looked down.|$|E

5000|$|A hen {{leaves her}} eggs unguarded, and a mean-looking weasel stealthily creeps into the {{henhouse}} while the narrator frets. Just {{as he is}} about to grab the eggs, they all hatch at once, and the chicks shout [...] "BOO!" [...] in unison. The frightened weasel evokes a Joe Penner catch-phrase, [...] "Don't ever DOOO that!" [...] and gasps as his <b>heart</b> <b>pounds.</b>|$|R
5|$|Flashbacks {{throughout}} the episode show the attempts {{of a teenage}} Dexter (Devon Graye) to feel his <b>heart</b> <b>pound.</b> At {{the end of the}} episode, Debra turns on the television in Dexter's apartment and shows him the news: a team of scuba divers in Biscayne Bay has uncovered over 30 garbage bags, each containing parts of Dexter's mutilated victims. As he watches, his heart races.|$|R
60|$|The {{transition}} {{had been}} so sudden and so unexpected that it left {{me for a moment}} forgetful of aught else than my strange metamorphosis. My first thought was, is this then death! Have I indeed passed over forever into that other life! But I could not well believe this, as I could feel my <b>heart</b> <b>pounding</b> against my ribs from the exertion of my efforts to release myself from the anaesthesis which had held me. My breath was coming in quick, short gasps, cold sweat stood out from every pore of my body, and the ancient experiment of pinching revealed the fact that I was anything other than a wraith.|$|E
6000|$|Happy Jack {{scrambled}} {{up on the}} old stone wall and looked this way and looked that way. He couldn't see a thing to be afraid of. He jumped down and ran a few steps. Then his heart failed, and he scampered {{back to the old}} stone wall in a panic. After a few minutes he tried again, and once more a foolish fear sent him back. The third time he gritted his teeth, said to himself over and over, [...] "I will! I will! I will!" [...] and ran with all his might. In no time at all he was across the dooryard and up in the big tree, his <b>heart</b> <b>pounding</b> with excitement.|$|E
60|$|In an {{agony of}} terror, Honora followed, {{her head on}} fire, her <b>heart</b> <b>pounding</b> faster than the hoof beats. But the animal she rode, though a good one, {{was no match for}} the great infuriated beast which she pursued. Presently she came to a wooded corner where the road forked thrice, and beyond, not without difficulty,--brought her {{sweating}} mare to a stand. The quality of her fear changed from wild terror to cold dread. A hermit thrush, in the wood near by, broke the silence with a song inconceivably sweet. At last {{she went back to the}} farm-house, hoping against hope that Hugh might have returned by another road. But he was not there. The farmer was still nonchalantly whittling.|$|E
5000|$|Many of the Who's songs, {{especially}} {{songs from}} Who's Next and Quadrophenia, {{need to have}} pre-recorded tapes when performed live. Pridden once said, [...] "I don't trust machines. Machines go wrong. My <b>heart</b> <b>pounds</b> before I press the button hoping for it to work." [...] Daltrey also said, [...] "Bob has had the tape recorder thrown at him many a time - especially when the thing'd break!." ...|$|R
6000|$|Cooper Creek. December, 1960. His <b>heart</b> <b>pounded.</b> That was all {{he needed}} to know. He stood up, shaking himself, {{stamping}} {{his feet on the}} cold ground. The sun had moved across the sky to {{the very edge of the}} hills. He smiled. Already he had discovered the exact time and place. Now he needed only to go back, perhaps to November, to Cooper Creek-- ...|$|R
6000|$|He was surprised. He looked self-conscious. His <b>heart</b> <b>pounded.</b> He {{was still}} more {{agitated}} when the ballots were counted and Gunch said, [...] "It's {{a pleasure to}} announce that Georgie Babbitt {{will be the next}} assistant gavel-wielder. I know of no man who stands more stanchly for common sense and enterprise than good old George. Come on, let's give him our best long yell!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Once {{across the}} bridge and in the mill, she fairly ran {{up the stairs and}} into the empty office, to {{perceive}} her bag lying on the desk where she had left it, and sat down for a few minutes beside the window, her <b>heart</b> <b>pounding</b> in her breast as though she had barely escaped an accident threatening her with physical annihilation. Something had happened to her at last! But what did it mean? Where would it lead? Her fear, her antagonism, of which she was still conscious, her resentment that Ditmar had thus surreptitiously chosen to approach her in a moment when they were unobserved were mingled with a throbbing exultation in that he had noticed her, that there was something in her to attract him in that way, to make his voice thicker and his smile apologetic when he spoke to her. Of that [...] "something-in-her" [...] she had been aware before, but never had it been so unmistakably recognized and beckoned to from without. She was at once terrified, excited--and flattered.|$|E
60|$|He set to work. The wall of ice {{was five}} {{feet above the}} ground on which the boat rested. First {{prospecting}} for the best launching-place, he found where a huge cake of ice shelved upward from the river that ran fifteen feet below {{to the top of the}} wall. This was a score of feet away, and at the end of an hour he had managed to get the boat that far. He was sick with nausea from his exertions, and at times it seemed that blindness smote him, for he could not see, his eyes vexed with spots and points of light that were as excruciating as diamond-dust, his <b>heart</b> <b>pounding</b> up in his throat and suffocating him. Elijah betrayed no interest, did not move nor open his eyes; and Daylight fought out his battle alone. At last, falling on his knees from the shock of exertion, he got the boat poised on a secure balance on top the wall. Crawling on hands and knees, he placed in the boat his rabbit-skin robe, the rifle, and the pail. He did not bother with the ax. It meant an additional crawl of twenty feet and back, and if the need for it should arise he well knew he would be past all need.|$|E
60|$|Wingate, {{notwithstanding}} his iron nerve, awoke with a start, in {{the grey}} {{of the following}} morning, to find his <b>heart</b> <b>pounding</b> against his ribs and a chill sense of horror stealing into his brain. Nothing had happened or was happening except that one cry,--the low, awful cry {{of a man in}} agony. He sat up, switched on the electric light by his side and gazed at the round table, his fingers clenched around the butt of his pistol. Dredlinton, from whom had come the sound, had fallen with his head and shoulders upon the table. His face was invisible, only there crept from his hidden lips a faint repetition of the cry,--the hideous sob, it might have been, as of a spirit descending into hell. Then there was silence. Phipps was sitting bolt upright, his eyes wide open, motionless but breathing heavily. He seemed to be in a state of coma, neither wholly asleep nor wholly conscious. Rees was leaning as far back in his chair as his cords permitted. His patch of high colour had gone; there was an ugly twist to his mouth, a livid tinge in his complexion, but nevertheless he slept. Wingate rose to his feet and watched. Phipps seemed keyed up to suffering. Dredlinton showed no sign. Their gaoler strolled up to the table.|$|E
60|$|There {{it was in}} a nutshell. The {{eyes had}} clearly come apart from the rest of him and were on their own. My <b>heart</b> <b>pounded</b> and my breath choked in my windpipe. I had {{stumbled}} on an accidental mention of a totally unfamiliar race. Obviously non-Terrestrial. Yet, to the characters in the book, it was perfectly natural--which suggested they belonged to the same species.|$|R
60|$|Somehow I kept my head, {{even though}} my <b>heart</b> <b>pounded</b> like a hammer and the blood drummed in my ears. It was the thought of Steele that saved me. But I felt cold at the narrow margin. I had reached a point, I feared, where a kiss, one touch from this bewildering {{creature}} of fire and change and sweetness would make me put her before Steele and my duty.|$|R

30|$|These {{five factors}} {{mentioned}} above impinge {{on the students}} as they cause psychological and physiological problems. At the psychological level, it affects motivation (Campbell & Ortiz, 1991), decreases attention and increases the probability of language errors while using language (Sarason, 1980) and creates a negative attitude towards target language (Shohamy, 1982) and towards the self which Knox et al. (1993) have termed as negative self-concept. Physiologically too students experience difficulties. For example, their hands sweat and shiver, heads ache, <b>hearts</b> <b>pound,</b> memory falls short of expected recollection and so on. As a result, to use Alcala’s (2002) words, anxious students “frequently fail to reach their potential. Their marks do not fully reflect their knowledge of second language” (p. 2).|$|R
