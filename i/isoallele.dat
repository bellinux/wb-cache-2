40|$|A {{convenient}} {{method is}} described for the intracistronic mapping of genetic sites responsible for electrophoretic variation {{of a specific}} protein in Drosophila melanogaster. A number of wild-type isoalleles of the rosy locus have been isolated which {{are associated with the}} production of electrophoretically distinguishable xanthine dehydrogenases. Large-scale recombination experiments were carried out involving null enzyme mutants induced on electrophoretically distinct wild-type isoalleles, the genetic basis for which is followed as a nonselective marker in the cross. Additionally, a large-scale recombination experiment was carried out involving null enzyme rosy mutants induced on the same wild-type <b>isoallele.</b> Examination of the electrophoretic character of crossover and convertant products recovered from the latter experiment revealed that all exhibited the same parental electrophoretic character. In addition to documenting the stability of the xanthine dehydrogenase electrophoretic character, this observation argues against a special mutagenesis hypothesis to explain conversions resulting from allele recombination studies...|$|E
40|$|The bronze (bz) locus in maize, {{located in}} the short arm of {{chromosome}} 9 (9 S), is the structural gene for the anthocyanin biosynthetic enzyme UFGT. The gene has been cloned and its physical map has been oriented relative to the centromere of 9 S. We report here the genetic fine structure mapping of several biochemically characterized EMS-induced bz-E mutations, derived from the Bz-W 22 <b>isoallele,</b> and Ds insertion bz-m mutations, derived from the Bz-McC <b>isoallele.</b> Two UFGT-, CRM+ mutants (bz-E 2 and bz-E 5), which genetically identify coding sequences in the gene, and three UFGT-, CRM- bz-E mutants were mapped against the Ds insertion mutants bz-m 1 and bz-m 2 (DI) by selecting Bz intragenic recombinants from heterozygotes of the type bz-E/bz-m. The exclusive occurrence of one recombinant outside marker class allowed the unambiguous placement of the mutants in a genetic fine structure map. Peculiarly, the two CRM+ bz-E mutants lie upstream of the three CRM- bz-E mutants and at a considerable genetic distance. The UFGT allozymes encoded by the progenitor alleles Bz-W 22 and Bz-McC differ in two properties, thermal stability and activity. The sites responsible for these properties were mapped as unselected markers among the Bz intragenic recombinants. The thermal stability site, which also identifies a coding region of the gene, mapped {{very close to the}} CRM+ bz-E mutant sites. The site responsible for variation in activity, which probably identifies a region involved in regulation of expression of the bz locus, mapped at the 5 ' or proximal end of the locus. It was found to be inseparable from the Ds insertion in bz-m 1 that lies very close to the 5 ' end of the transcribed region. —Evidence was obtained that the insertion of Ds within the bz gene has a suppressing effect on intragenic recombination. Additional data are also presented supporting our observation that Ds affects the pattern of intragenic recombination at bz. —Based on the total genetic length of the bz gene and on the physical size of the transcribed region, we estimate that one unit of recombination at bronze corresponds to 14 kb of DNA. This estimate is more than 100 times smaller than the average value for the whole genome and implies that there may be regions, such as bronze, that serve as hotspots for recombination...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} simple DNA {{sequence}} polymorphisms on intragenic recombination in the rosy locus of Drosophila melanogaster was assayed. Two crosses were performed involving nearly identical molecular distances between selective ry null mutations (3778 nucleotides and 3972 nucleotides). In one heterozygote (ry(606) /ry(531)), {{in addition to}} the nucleotide substitution ry(-) mutations, there were 11 simple nucleotide polymorphisms between the selective markers as well as additional flanking simple nucleotide polymorphisms within the rosy locus. In the other heterozygote (ry(606) /ry(609)), there were no additional polymorphisms because the two rosy nucleotide substitution mutations were induced on the same rosy <b>isoallele</b> (ry(+ 6)). From ry(606) /ry(531) heterozygous females, 27 intragenic crossovers and five marker conversions were seen among 4. 53 X 10 (5) progeny. From ry(606) /ry(609) heterozygous females, 23 intragenic crossovers and eight marker conversions were seen among 4. 18 X 10 (5) progeny. The intragenic crossover frequencies per kilobase of DNA were very similar, 1. 6 X 10 (- 5) for ry(606) /ry(531) and 1. 4 X 10 (- 5) for ry(606) /ry(609). Thus, simple DNA sequence polymorphisms neither inhibit nor promote intragenic recombination in D. melanogaster...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: A new gene, thi-lo, is {{described}} in Neurospora crassa. This gene is {{shown to be a}} modifier of the nutritional response of strains containing the thi- 1 gene, and is not nutritionally detectable {{in the absence of the}} thi-I mutant locus. The gene thi-lo is additionally characterized by a decreased ability to synthesize thiamine from thiazole and pyrimidine; thi-lo appears to modify only thi- 1 strains because of their unusually high thiamine requirements. The nutritional responses of strains containing either thi- 2 or thi- 3 loci are not affected by the presence of thi-lo. Both thi-lo and thi- 4 are anomalous in the condensation of pyrimidine and thiazole. The probability that thi-lo may be an <b>isoallele</b> of thi- 4 is based upon a similarity of metabolic pattern and upon location on chromosome III. The failure to obtain recombination in crosses between strains containing thi-lo and thi- 4 con-stitutes additional support for their allelism. The metabolic pathway of thiamine synthesis in Neurospora is not entirely agreed upon. Tatum & Bell (1946) concluded that thiamine is derived by a condensation of substances equivalent to vitamin pyrimidine (2 -methyl- 4...|$|E
