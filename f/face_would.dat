5|$|Several actors {{campaigned for}} the leading role; ultimately, Eastwood decided that Jolie's <b>face</b> <b>would</b> suit the 1920s period setting. The film also stars Jeffrey Donovan, Jason Butler Harner, John Malkovich, Michael Kelly, and Amy Ryan. While some {{characters}} are composites, most {{are based on}} actual people. Principal photography, which began on October 15, 2007, and concluded {{a few weeks later}} in December, took place in Los Angeles and other locations in southern California. Actors and crew noted that Eastwood's low-key direction resulted in a calm set and short working days. In post-production, scenes were supplemented with computer-generated skylines, backgrounds, vehicles and people.|$|E

25|$|Hogan {{did this}} to prevent himself from ever hooking the ball off the tee. By {{positioning}} his hands in this manner, he ensured that the club <b>face</b> <b>would</b> be slightly open upon impact, creating a fade (left to right ball flight) {{as opposed to a}} draw or hook (right to left ball flight).|$|E
25|$|Some {{photographers who}} came later complained to Seedman {{that they had}} been unfairly {{deprived}} of the same photo opportunity their competitors had gotten. He obligingly brought Dellernia out for them to see again, but the defendant had his head low. So Seedman, knowing he would regret doing so, forced Dellernia's head up and held him by the chin so his <b>face</b> <b>would</b> be visible.|$|E
25|$|Taliban decision-makers, {{particularly}} Mullah Omar, seldom if {{ever talked}} directly to non-Muslim foreigners, so aid providers {{had to deal}} with intermediaries whose approvals and agreements were often reversed. Around September 1997 the heads of three UN agencies in Kandahar were expelled from the country after protesting when a female attorney for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees was forced to talk from behind a curtain so her <b>face</b> <b>would</b> not be visible.|$|E

40|$|Are faces {{processed}} {{differently from}} other complex visual stimuli? For {{this to be}} the case, three main criteria would have to be fulfilled: (1) <b>face</b> recognition <b>would</b> exhibit functional characteristics not found in the recognition of other visual stimuli, (2) the neural machinery that mediates <b>face</b> recognition <b>would</b> be anatomically separate from the neurons mediating general object recognition, and (3) <b>faces</b> <b>would</b> be represented differently from other visual stimuli at the neural level. This paper assesses the data bearing on these criteria and discusses whether they do indeed constitute evidence for a special face processing system...|$|R
25|$|Two schoolfriends, who {{had also}} been {{evacuated}} from Singapore to Batavia, heard that Gorton was in hospital, arranged {{for them to be}} put on a ship for Fremantle, which left on 23 February and treated Gorton's wounds. When the ship arrived in Fremantle, on 3 March, one of Gorton's arm wounds had become septic and needed extensive treatment. However, he was more concerned about the effect that the sight of his mutilated <b>face</b> <b>would</b> have on his wife. It is reported that Betty Gorton, who had been running the farm in his absence, was relieved to see Gorton alive.|$|E
25|$|Several factors came {{together}} for Frazier in this fight. He was 27 {{years old and}} at his boxing peak physically and mentally, Ali, 29, was coming back from a three-year absence but had kept active. He had had two good wins, including a bruising battle with Oscar Bonavena, whom Ali had defeated by a TKO in 15 rounds. Frazier worked on strategy with coach Eddie Futch. They noted Ali's tendency to throw a right-hand uppercut from a straight standing position after dropping the hand in preparation to throw it with force. Futch instructed Frazier to watch Ali's right hand and, at the moment Ali dropped it, to throw a left hook {{at the spot where}} they knew Ali's <b>face</b> <b>would</b> be a second later. Frazier staggered Ali in the 11th round and knocked down Ali in the 15th in this way.|$|E
25|$|Margherita Guarducci relates a {{tradition}} that the original icon of Mary attributed to Luke, sent by Eudokia to Pulcheria from Palestine, was a large circular icon only of her head. When the icon arrived in Constantinople it was fitted in as the head into a very large rectangular icon of her holding the Christ child {{and it is this}} composite icon that became the one historically known as the Hodegetria. She further states another tradition that when the last Latin Emperor of Constantinople, Baldwin II, fled Constantinople in 1261 he took this original circular portion of the icon with him. This remained in the possession of the Angevin dynasty who had it likewise inserted into a much larger image of Mary and the Christ child, which is presently enshrined above the high altar of the Benedictine Abbey church of Montevergine. Unfortunately this icon has been over the subsequent centuries subjected to repeated repainting, so {{that it is difficult to}} determine what the original image of Mary’s <b>face</b> <b>would</b> have looked like. However, Guarducci also states that in 1950 an ancient image of Mary at the Church of Santa Francesca Romana was determined to be a very exact, but reverse mirror image of the original circular icon that was made in the 5th century and brought to Rome, where it has remained until the present.|$|E

40|$|The cross-race effect – {{enhanced}} {{recognition of}} racial ingroup faces – has been justified {{to exist in}} other categories, such as arbitrary groups. This study aimed to investigate the effect of crossing racial (black/white) and arbitrary (blue/yellow) categories, {{in addition to the}} role of facial expressions in this phenomenon. 120 Caucasian students (from the UK, Macedonia, and Portugal) performed a discrimination task (judging faces as new vs. previously seen). Using a within-subjects design, reaction times and accuracy were measured. We hypothesized that (1) the arbitrary group membership of <b>faces</b> <b>would</b> moderate the cross-race effect and (2) the racial group membership of <b>faces</b> <b>would</b> moderate the usual recognition advantage for happy faces...|$|R
25|$|On New Year's Eve 1857, Queen Victoria, as a {{symbolic}} and political gesture, was presented with the responsibility of selecting a location for the permanent capital of the Province of Canada. In reality, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald had assigned this selection process to the Executive Branch of the Government, as previous attempts {{to arrive at a}} consensus had ended in deadlock. The 'Queen's choice' {{turned out to be the}} small frontier town of Ottawa for two main reasons: Firstly, Ottawa's isolated location in a back country surrounded by dense forest far from the Canada–US border and situated on a cliff <b>face</b> <b>would</b> make it more defensible from attack. Secondly, Ottawa was located approximately midway between Toronto and Kingston (in Canada West) and Montreal and Quebec City (in Canada East). Additionally, despite Ottawa's regional isolation it had seasonal water transportation access to Montreal over the Ottawa River and to Kingston via the Rideau Waterway. By 1854 it also had a modern all season Bytown and Prescott Railway that carried passengers, lumber and supplies the 82-kilometres to Prescott on the Saint Lawrence River and beyond. Ottawa's small size, it was thought, would make it less prone to rampaging politically motivated mobs, as had happened in the previous Canadian capitals. The government already owned the land that would eventually become Parliament Hill which they thought would be an ideal location for building the Parliament Buildings. Ottawa was the only settlement of any substantial size that was already located directly on the border of French populated former Lower Canada and English populated former Upper Canada thus additionally making the selection an important political compromise. Queen Victoria made her 'Queen's choice' very quickly just before welcoming in the New Year.|$|E
500|$|Chrétien also pursued what {{he called}} [...] "Plan B," [...] hoping to {{convince}} Quebec voters that economic and legal obstacles would follow if Quebec were to declare itself sovereign, whose public <b>face</b> <b>would</b> become professor Stéphane Dion. [...] This included {{a reference to the}} Supreme Court of Canada, which followed Federal intervention post-referendum into the Bertrand case: The 1998 Reference Re Secession of Quebec stated that unilateral secession was illegal, would require a constitutional amendment, and that only a clear majority on a clear question could bring about any sort of obligation on the federal and provincial governments to negotiate secession.|$|E
500|$|There {{were several}} scenes {{throughout}} this episode that {{were removed from}} the script, and not broadcast. One of these comes just after Tom Tucker apologizes to Peter about losing his temper; it was intended that Jake Tucker would appear, and the origin of his upside-down <b>face</b> <b>would</b> be revealed. The scene with [...] "The Peanuts Reunion" [...] was originally meant for the season four episode [...] "Patriot Games", but was moved to this episode to ease time constraints in [...] "Patriot Games". The scene was described by 20th Century Fox worker Leann Siegel as being depressing.|$|E

500|$|Executive {{producer}} Herbert Franklin Solow {{attempted to}} sell them {{on the idea that}} a fresh <b>face</b> <b>would</b> bring believability to the part, but they were aware that she was Roddenberry's girlfriend. Despite this they agreed to her casting, not wanting to upset Roddenberry {{at this point in the}} production. After the pilot was rejected, a second pilot was produced. While it was generally explained that the network disliked a female character as the second-in-command of the Enterprise, Solow had a different opinion of events. He explained that [...] "No one liked her acting... she was a nice woman, but the reality was, she couldn't act." [...] "Where No Man Has Gone Before" [...] successfully took Star Trek to a series order. Barrett had been given the role of voicing the computer on the USS Enterprise, but was demanding that Roddenberry write her into the main cast.|$|E
500|$|Monkey Punch {{did not ask}} {{permission}} to use the Arsène Lupin name and at the time Japan did not enforce trade copyrights. By the time Leblanc's estate launched legal action in Japan, the name was considered to have entered into common use. However, {{this was not the case}} in North America and Europe and several foreign releases of Lupin III media dropped the Lupin III title and the character himself was renamed to [...] "Rupan" [...] or [...] "Wolf". In France, the series was known as Edgar, Detective Cambrioleur (Edgar, Detective Burglar) with Lupin himself renamed [...] "Edgar de la Cambriole" [...] (Edgar of Burglary). Monkey Punch has stated that using the same character design, behavior and <b>face</b> <b>would</b> be illegal, but using a name alone is not illegal. In 2012, Leblanc's original Arsène Lupin entered the public domain in France due to 70 years passing since his death in 1941, and is in the public domain for any country that enforces the rule of the shorter term.|$|E
500|$|Sinclair {{himself said}} in 2005 that the C5 [...] "was early {{for what it}} was. People reacted {{negatively}} and the press didn't help.

[...] Sam Dawson of Classic and Sport Car Magazine described the C5 as [...] "incredibly fun to drive", suggesting that the safety concerns [...] "could have been addressed if it wasn't {{for the fact that}} it was already doomed as a national joke." [...] He noted the disconnect between the media's expectations of a serious electric car and the reality of the C5, which he called [...] "just a fun way of getting around". Professor Stuart Cole of the University of South Wales comments that the C5 suffered from the design of the roads and the attitudes of the time, which were not geared towards pedal or electric vehicles: [...] "In the days before unleaded petrol, your <b>face</b> <b>would</b> have been at the height of every exhaust pipe, and drivers weren't used to having to consider slower-moving cyclists. But with more cycle lanes, better education, and workplaces providing showers, etc., the world now is much more geared up for people looking for alternatives to the car, and hopefully will become even more so in the future." ...|$|E
