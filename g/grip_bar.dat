40|$|Although {{explosive}} isometric contraction provides {{little work}} toward the outside, force-time {{parameters of the}} rising phase of the force-time curve {{may be able to}} predict muscle power. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the relationship between muscle power with work (power grip) and force-time parameters during the rising phase in explosive isometric grip. Fifteen healthy young adult males participated in this study. Power grip was measured using loads of 20 - 50 % MVC (peak isometric force). Subjects pulled explosively on a <b>grip</b> <b>bar</b> held with the second digital joints without the thumb. Peak power was calculated from peak velocity and load. Explosive isometric grip was measured using a hand dynamometer. Time-series data of both tests were sampled by an analog-to-digital interface. Both tests were performed with the subjects seated with a sagittal and horizontal position of the arm supported by an armrest. Peak power in the power grip test tended to be larger with an increase of the load, but there was no significant difference between 40 % and 50 % MVC. Only the peak power in 50 % MVC significantly correlated with peak grip force (r = 0. 52, p < 0. 05). The force-time parameters related to the peak rate of the rising force phase in explosive isometric grip significantly correlated with the peak powers (30 - 50 % MVC) (r = | 0. 58 - 0. 78 |). Peak rate of the rising force phase in explosive isometric grip may be useful for predicting muscle power with loads between 30 - 50 % MVC...|$|E

Although we know that this phenomenon is mediated by neural mechanisms such as interactions between the cerebral hemispheres or spinal reflexes, th e underlying mechanism is still far from clear. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine bilateral deficit in children whose nervous system was not yet completely mature, and to clarify the developmental characteristics of bilateral and unilateral movements. Right-handed 11 children aged 6 to 9 participated as subjects and were compared to right-handed the adult subjects aged 18 to 22. The subjects were asked to perform a simple reaction time task by grasping a <b>grip</b> <b>bar</b> in response to an auditory stimulus. The subjects carried out this task uder three conditions: with the right hand(dominant); with left hand(non-dominant); and with both hands simultaneously. In the adult subjects, the bilateral RT was consistently shorter than either the left or right unilateral RT. However, the bilateral deficit was not seen in the children to the same extent as in the adults, and, in fact, we found facilitation rather than deficit in some bilateral responses of the children. Generally, it is difficult for children to manipulate things separately while they are carrying out a task. In the present study, it was presumed that facilitation rather than inhibition occurred in the children as they carried out a bilateral simultaneous movement, that is, a kind of maximal effort when they responded as fast as possible. We hypothesized that different mechanisms may be responsible for fast bilateral movement in children...|$|E

50|$|The usual {{military}} {{replacement for}} a <b>bar</b> <b>grip</b> tyre today {{is now a}} pattern like the Michelin XCL or 'NATO Pattern'. This consists of large solid rubber blocks, of similar size to the <b>bar</b> <b>grip</b> <b>bars.</b> These blocks are arranged in crosswise bars of three blocks, {{so that there is}} now good water clearance between blocks, both radially and axially. As the blocks are still large though and unsiped, water clearance from the block surface is still poor and the tyres still have a risk of aquaplaning on wet tarmac, compared to a typical road tyre. This pattern is also directional and so wheels should be mounted as either left-side or right-side.|$|R

50|$|<b>Bar</b> <b>grips</b> were {{replaced}} on light vehicles such as Land Rovers and Jeeps in the 1970s, although they remained on heavy trucks.

50|$|The poor water {{clearance}} of <b>bar</b> <b>grips</b> {{may limit}} their performance on very wet mud. With later patterns, {{such as the}} NATO, water may be squeezed out from between the blocks, leaving the mud drier and firmer.

40|$|Operant {{discrimination}} {{learning has}} been extensively utilized in the study on the perceptual ability of animals and their higher-order brain functions. We tested in this study whether American lobster Homarus americanus, which was previously found to possess ability of operant learning with claw gripping, could be trained to discriminate light stimuli of different intensities. For the current purpose, we newly developed a PC-controlled operant chamber that allowed the animal under a body-fixed condition to perform operant reward learning with claw gripping. Lobsters were first reinforced when they <b>gripped</b> the sensor <b>bar</b> upon presentation of a light cue. Then they were trained to <b>grip</b> the <b>bar</b> only when the light stimulus of a specific intensity was presented to obtain food reward while the stimuli of three different intensities including the reinforced one were presented in a random order. Finally, they were re-trained to <b>grip</b> the <b>bar</b> only when the light stimulus of another intensity that was not rewarded in the preceding training to obtain food while other intensities including {{the one that was}} rewarded previously were not rewarded any more. In these training procedures, the operant behavior occurred more frequently in response to the rewarded cue than to the non-rewarded one. The action latency for the reinforced stimuli showed a significant decrease in the course of training. These data demonstrate that lobsters can be trained with the light cues of different intensity as discriminative stimuli under a restrained condition that would allow application of electrophysiological techniques to the behaving subjects...|$|R

50|$|The first {{deliberate}} use <b>bar</b> <b>grip</b> tyres as off-road tyres, {{were developed}} pre-war as truck tyres particularly for army use. They used crosswise tread <b>bars</b> for <b>grip.</b> {{arranged in a}} helical pattern. A helical pattern was used to avoid the uneven rolling radius and vibration of a tread with simple crosswise bars and large gaps between. This helical pattern also {{gave rise to a}} sideways force, particularly on tarmac. As all tyres had the same 'hand', this force increased across {{the two sides of the}} vehicle. To counteract this force, the central stop-rib was added. The stop-rib was only partly successful though; snowy conditions led the Swiss Post Office to use left- and right-handed tyres to balance the force across the vehicle. Later developments would use balanced arrangements of ribs in a chevron or herringbone layout. The more common arrangement for the later low-speed military <b>bar</b> <b>grip</b> was to use straight bars, but relying on the centre rib to avoid their vibration problems on tarmac.|$|R
40|$|Operant {{conditioning}} is {{a common}} tool for studying cognitive aspects of brain functions. As {{the first step toward}} understanding those functions in simple invertebrate microbrains, we tested whether operant conditioning could be applied to train American lobster Homarus americanus that has been extensively adopted as an animal model for neurophysiological analyses of nervous system functions and behavioral control. The animal was trained by food rewarding for gripping of a sensor bar as the operant behavior. Lobsters were first reinforced when they acted on the bar with a stronger grip than a pre-set value. After this reinforcement, the animal learnt to <b>grip</b> the <b>bar</b> for food pellets. The yoked control experiment in which the animal received action-independent reinforcement excluded the possibility of pseudoconditioning that the food simply drove the animal to frequent gripping of the sensor bar. The association of the <b>bar</b> <b>grip</b> with food was extinguished by rewarding nothing to the operant behavior, and was restored by repeating the reinforcement process as before. In addition, lobsters successfully carried out differential reinforcement regarding the gripping force: their gripping force changed depending on the increased force threshold for food reward. These data demonstrate that lobsters can be trained by operant conditioning paradigms involving acquisition and extinction procedures with the precise claw gripping even under the force control...|$|R
