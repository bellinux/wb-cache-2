2500|$|While a Panamanian {{response}} to the flag raisings by the Zonians was expected, the crisis took most Americans by surprise. Several years later, Lyndon B. Johnson wrote in his memoirs that: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> students' action, I was certain we were in for trouble." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{hatred of}} war, he argued in 1936, [...] "can be {{no reason for}} being false to ourselves, {{in the name of}} an aimless amiability that cries ‘peace’ where there is none." [...] And in 1937: [...] "We have not kept {{agreements}} we made; we have made agreements we should not; we have tried to cheat our way to security, and now the security proves a cheat. We have forgotten the wisdom which says that since we cannot foresee where any road will lead in the end, we should stick to the straight and honest one." [...] Despite the prevailing pacifism of the time – and he exchanged views with [...] "passive pacifists" [...] in the correspondence-columns – such sentiments struck a chord. [...] "This is the voice of the England I love," [...] wrote a correspondent from Prague in 1938, [...] "and for whose soul I was trembling when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> welcome given Mr Chamberlain on his return from Munich." [...] Not everyone admired the letters, however: the pro-appeasement Times refused to publish him after 1935 (he described the Editor's office as [...] "an annexe of the German embassy"), and when he condemned the Italian invasion of Abyssinia and the democracies' inadequate response, he received abusive and threatening replies from Fascists, including one from Ezra Pound. Lucas put Pound's letter on display at the Cambridge Anti-Fascist Exhibition.|$|E

When <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Paragon and Bell Trefoil at Washington, I knew {{there had been a}} mistake made. He didn't know what he was doing. I'm a poor man, but I wouldn't take her with £5,000 a year, settled on myself." [...] Poor Mounser Green! ...|$|E

He was {{concerned}} in a burglary in the country, in which two old ladies were killed. Two of his accomplices were hung for it, but in consideration of his youth, and as it was not proved that he took an absolute part in the murder, he got off with a life sentence. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> case from Captain Wilson.|$|E
6000|$|... “It was {{not until}} I reached Havana that <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> ‘Maine,’ and then as I had {{a good deal of}} {{business}} to put through in this country it seemed advisable to get myself up as a Cuban,” he said. “I had evidence that the Administration were watching me, and I would never have got here at all if it hadn’t been for the help of a few friends among the Liberationists. Now, I fancy you and Don Maccario have something to tell me.” ...|$|E

[...] "It was rather audacious of him to propose to you the fourth time that he set eyes upon you; but I think that audacity is, on the whole, a good quality in the male sex. Another thing is, that if that will is worth {{anything}} he {{will be one of the}} wealthiest men in the whole of England; so, taking it altogether, I think I may congratulate you, my dear. And now I suppose that you have been in love with this young man all along. I guessed as much when I saw your face as he ran up to the carriage yesterday, and I was sure of it when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> tattooing. No girl would allow herself to be tattooed in the interest of abstract justice. Oh, yes! I know all about it; and now I am going out walking in the park with Dick, and I should advise you to compose yourself, for that artist is coming to draw you at twelve." ...|$|E

50|$|It was {{a miracle}} <b>I</b> even <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> league, not getting the {{newspaper}} or anything. But I was always interested in ballplayers like Allie Reynolds and, later, Mickey Mantle, because they were from Oklahoma, she said.|$|R
6000|$|... “I hardly {{remember}} now. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> something <b>about</b> <b>the</b> unworthiness {{of certain}} white geese out of stuffy drawing-rooms. It sounds mad, but the lady {{knows exactly what}} she wants. <b>I</b> also <b>heard</b> your praises sung. I sat there like a fool {{not knowing what to}} say.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 8. Morning. I HAVE DESIRED APRONIA TO BE ALWAYS CAREFUL, ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE LEGS. Pray, {{do you see}} {{any such}} great wit in that sentence? I must freely own that I do not. But party carries {{everything}} nowadays, and what a splutter have <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> wit of that saying, repeated with admiration above a hundred times in half an hour! Pray read it over again this moment, and consider it. I think the word is ADVISED, and not DESIRED. I should not have remembered it if I had not heard it so often. Why--ay--You must know I dreamed it just now, and waked with it in my mouth. Are you bit, or are you not, sirrahs? I met Mr. Harley in the Court of Requests, and he asked me how long I had learnt the trick of writing to myself? He had seen your letter through the glass case at the Coffee-house, and would swear it was my hand; and Mr. Ford, who took and sent it me, was of the same mind. I remember others have formerly said so too. I think I was little MD's writing-master.(10)--But come, what is here to do, writing to young women in a morning? I have other fish to fry; so good-morrow, my ladies all, good-morrow. Perhaps I'll answer your letter to-night, perhaps I won't; that's as saucy little Presto takes the humour.--At night. I walked in the Park to-day in spite of the weather, as I do always when it does not actually rain. Do you know what it has gone and done? We had a thaw for three days, then a monstrous dirt and snow, and now it freezes, like a pot-lid, upon our snow. I dined with Lady Betty Germaine, the first time since I came for England; and there did I sit, like a booby, till eight, looking over her and another lady at piquet, when I had other business enough to do. It was the coldest day I felt this year.|$|E

Why have these people invaded my book? ...|$|E

5000|$|Christopher Plummer's {{longtime}} manager, Lou Pitt, {{one of the}} film’s lead producers, {{was recommended}} Alan Judd's novel The Kaiser's Last Kiss.
