5000|$|... 8. In {{applications}} where {{monetary resources}} {{associated with a}} currency (i.e. funds) need not be specified and where a <b>field</b> <b>identifier</b> indicating currency is used, the first two (leftmost) characters are sufficient to identify a currency—example: US for United States dollars for general, unspecified purposes where a <b>field</b> <b>identifier</b> indicating currency is present. (A <b>field</b> <b>identifier</b> can be a preprinted field heading in an aligned document or a similarly-agreed application in electronic transmission of data.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{next three}} letters {{identify}} the industry field: [...] "DES" [...] {{refers to the}} industry field of learning design. Sometimes the industry <b>field</b> <b>identifier</b> can be more generic, allowing use of the unit across various sectors and training package e.g. [...] "COM" [...] often refers to communication.|$|E
5000|$|In particular, {{an object}} should avoid invoking methods {{of a member}} object {{returned}} by another method. For many modern object oriented languages that use a dot as <b>field</b> <b>identifier,</b> the law can be stated simply as [...] "use only one dot". That is, the code [...] breaks the law where [...] does not. As an analogy, when one wants a dog to walk, one does not command the dog's legs to walk directly; instead one commands the dog which then commands its own legs.|$|E
50|$|The {{service order}} process {{utilizes}} the USOC, USO and <b>Field</b> <b>Identifiers</b> (FIDs), to provision, bill and maintain services and equipment. Universal Service Order or USO Codes {{are used by}} telecommunications service providers to collect and structure all the information needed for service activation, including ordering, provisioning, service assurance and billing. USOC codes, also known as rate elements, are used by telecommunications service providers to identify each billable element of a customer’s service. <b>Field</b> <b>Identifiers</b> or FIDs are used by telecommunications service providers to identify a billing preference or attribute of a customer’s account. FIDs define the technical parameters required to provision and bill a customer’s service beyond those described in USOCs.|$|R
30|$|The index {{generation}} in Lucene was made as follows: for each {{record in the}} database with metadata values a distinct Document Lucene is generated, composed by five <b>fields</b> (<b>identifier,</b> title, description, keywords and a not indexed one that stores the address of accessed document).|$|R

5000|$|... 9. In {{applications}} {{where there}} is a need to distinguish between different types of currencies, or where funds are required as in the banking environment, or {{where there is}} no <b>field</b> <b>identifier,</b> the third (rightmost) character of the alphabetic code is an indicator, preferably mnemonic, derived from the name of the major currency unit or fund—example: USD for general, unspecified purposes; USN for United States dollar next-day funds, and USS for funds which are immediately available for Federal Reserve transfer, withdrawal in cash or transfer in like funds (same-day funds). Since there is no need for such a distinction in international trade applications, the funds codes have not been included in the Annex to the present Recommendation.|$|E
40|$|This Release {{introduces}} minor updates to submission Templates 1, 2, 3, and 5 {{that are}} based on recent SEC requests and rulemaking activities. EDGAR 8. 4. s supports backward compatibility with the 8. 4 templates as long as the reporting requirements for specific form types have not changed. EDGAR 8. 4. s server software supports all of the <b>field</b> <b>identifiers</b> that were valid in the 8. 4 version of the PureEdge templates...|$|R

5000|$|UDF 2457 is the Hubble Ultra Deep <b>Field</b> (UDF) <b>identifier</b> for a {{red dwarf}} star {{calculated}} to be about [...] from Earth with a very dim apparent magnitude of 25.|$|R
25|$|Computers {{that belong}} to a subnet are {{addressed}} with a common, identical, most-significant bit-group in their IP address. This results in the logical division of an IP address into two fields, a network number or routing prefix and the rest <b>field</b> or host <b>identifier.</b> The rest <b>field</b> is an <b>identifier</b> for a specific host or network interface.|$|R
50|$|The two <b>identifier</b> <b>fields</b> (A & B) {{combine to}} form a 29-bit identifier.|$|R

2500|$|UDFy-38135539 (also {{known as}} [...] "HUDF.YD3") is the Hubble Ultra Deep <b>Field</b> (UDF) <b>identifier</b> for a galaxy which was {{calculated}} [...] {{to have a}} light travel time of 13.1 billion years with a present proper distance of around 30 billion light-years.|$|R
50|$|UDF 423 is the Hubble Ultra Deep <b>Field</b> (UDF) <b>identifier</b> for {{a distant}} spiral galaxy. With an {{apparent}} magnitude of 20, UDF 423 {{is one of}} the brightest galaxies in the HUDF and also has one of the largest apparent sizes in the HUDF.|$|R
5000|$|Record {{identifier}} field—identifying {{the record}} and assigned by the organization that creates the record. The record <b>identifier</b> <b>field</b> has tag 001.|$|R
50|$|Since July 2005, the MEDLINE article {{indexing}} process extracts identifiers {{from the}} article abstract and puts {{those in a}} <b>field</b> called Secondary <b>Identifier</b> (SI). The secondary <b>identifier</b> <b>field</b> is to store accession numbers to various databases of molecular sequence data, gene expression or chemical compounds and clinical trial IDs. For clinical trials, PubMed extracts trial IDs for the two largest trial registries: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT identifier) and the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register (IRCTN identifier).|$|R
5000|$|Identifier (0-9 characters)—This {{identifies}} data {{within the}} bibliographic <b>field.</b> Where used, <b>identifiers</b> {{are composed of}} a delimiter (1 char, IS1 of ISO 646) and an identifying code (1-9 chars, as defined in the leader), plus a variable length string containing the data.|$|R
5000|$|This {{encapsulation}} {{is used in}} Fibre Channel [...] and SAS, and is {{also supported}} in iSCSI in RFC 3980. This addition requires either a shortened vendor-specific <b>identifier</b> <b>field,</b> or some OUI bits {{are assumed to be}} 0, such as when using EUI-64 Mapped format.|$|R
50|$|After these incidents, {{it became}} clear that apart from stating a server's access policy, a {{technical}} means of enforcing a policy was needed. One such mechanism was provided by extending semantics of a Reference <b>Identifier</b> <b>field</b> in an NTP packet when a Stratum field is 0.|$|R
50|$|Data is {{transferred}} across {{the bus in}} fixed form messages of selectable lengths. The master task transmits a header that consists of a break signal followed by synchronization and <b>identifier</b> <b>fields.</b> The slaves respond with a data frame that consists of between 2, 4 and 8 data bytes plus 3 bytes of control information.|$|R
50|$|Physical sectors are {{actually}} larger than 512 bytes, as {{in addition to}} the 512 byte data field they include a sector <b>identifier</b> <b>field,</b> CRC bytes (in some cases error correction bytes) and gaps between the fields. These additional bytes are not normally included in the quoted figure for overall storage capacity of the disk.|$|R
50|$|If {{a patient}} has insurance, the {{pharmacist}} will {{key in the}} patient’s insurance number in the primary <b>field</b> and an <b>identifier</b> from the co-pay card into the secondary insurer field. Instantaneously the pharmacy benefit manager provides coverage data, relaying the patient’s out of pocket, or co-pay to the secondary insurer’s benefit manager, who then provides a discount accordingly.|$|R
3000|$|... kF-set. This is the set {{of records}} which appear to be {{identical}} given the information available. In k-anonymization the k-set is {{the set of}} records {{that appear to be}} identical when the quasi <b>identifier</b> <b>fields</b> are pseudonymized. The kF-set is the set of records which appear to be identical in the pseudonymized data when all quasi identifiers except for those in set F are masked.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} stages of {{development}} of the Internet Protocol, network administrators interpreted an IP address in two parts: network number portion and host number portion. The highest order octet (most significant eight bits) in an address was designated as the network number and the remaining bits were called the rest <b>field</b> or host <b>identifier</b> and were used for host numbering within a network.|$|R
50|$|The Heber City Municipal Airport, or Russ McDonald <b>Field,</b> FAA <b>identifier</b> 36U, {{is located}} two {{miles south of}} the city, near the {{junction}} of U.S. Route 40 and U.S. Route 189, and is capable of handling aircraft up to large corporate jet, including Gulfstreams and Global Express. Approximately 85 aircraft are based at the airport. The airport is served by a GPS instrument approach procedure, allowing aircraft to arrive at the airport in adverse weather. During the winter ski season, and particularly the Sundance Film Festival, the airport is crowded with corporate jets as it is the closest airport to Park City. The airport is also home to the Heber Valley Airshow, held each summer. The nearest airport with commercial airline service is Salt Lake City International Airport.|$|R
40|$|This note {{defines the}} fields, ordering, and {{numerical}} ranges of the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer geometrical software identifiers. The scheme establishes a unique {{identification of the}} sensitive components of the detector for data access and provides a mechanism for mapping to conditions data and production data. The names of the logical <b>fields</b> of the <b>identifier</b> hierarchy for each subsystem (MDT, CSC, RPC, TGC) are presented along with their corresponding value ranges. Considerations behind the chosen scheme, including naming conventions and value ranges, are briefly discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Record linkage {{is highly}} {{sensitive}} {{to the quality of}} the data being linked, so all data sets under consideration (particularly their key <b>identifier</b> <b>fields)</b> should ideally undergo a data quality assessment prior to record linkage. Many key identifiers for the same entity can be presented quite differently between (and even within) data sets, which can greatly complicate record linkage unless understood ahead of time. For example, key identifiers for a man named William J. Smith might appear in three different data sets as so: ...|$|R
40|$|From the {{discovery}} of cell-free fetal (cff) -DNA in 1997 so far, many studies have been performed on various aspects of cff-nucleic acid. It is undoubted that currently, invasive prenatal diagnosis progresses to the noninvasive test. However, there are many problems. One {{of the most challenging}} issues in this field is differentiation and detection of the small amount of cff-nucleic acid in maternal plasma. Many markers and methods have been used for this purpose. This review makes an attempt to review and compare the studies in the <b>field.</b> Six <b>identifier</b> markers including Y-specific sequence, polymorphisms, epigenetic difference, DNA size difference, fetal mRNA, and microRNA as well as {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each marker are discussed. This review provides a relatively perfect set on cff-nucleic acid biomarkers in various physiological and pathological status of pregnancy, helping to review and compare the prior obtained results, and improving designation in future studies...|$|R
50|$|A {{record type}} is a data type that {{describes}} such values and variables. Most modern computer languages allow the programmer to define new record types. The definition includes specifying the data type of each <b>field</b> and an <b>identifier</b> (name or label) {{by which it}} can be accessed. In type theory, product types (with no field names) are generally preferred due to their simplicity, but proper record types are studied in languages such as System F-sub. Since type-theoretical records may contain first-class function-typed fields in addition to data, they can express many features of object-oriented programming.|$|R
50|$|The DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID) {{is used by}} {{a client}} to get an IP address from a DHCPv6 server. It has a 2-byte DUID type field, and a variable-length <b>identifier</b> <b>field</b> up to 128 bytes. Its actual length depends on its type. The server compares the DUID with its {{database}} and delivers configuration data (address, lease times, DNS servers, etc.) to the client. The first 16 bits of a DUID contain the DUID type, {{of which there are}} three types. The meaning of the remaining DUID depend on the type.|$|R
50|$|RESPONSE SPACE:Response Space is {{the time}} between the <b>IDENTIFIER</b> <b>field</b> and the first Data byte which starts the LIN RESPONSE part of the LIN frame. When a {{particular}} LIN frame is transmitted completely, Header + Response, by the LIN MASTER, the LIN MASTER will use the full RESPONSE SPACE TIME to calculate when to send the response after sending the header. If the response part of the LIN frame is coming from a physically different SLAVE NODE, then each node (master & slave) will utilize 50% of the Response Space time in their timeout calculations.|$|R
50|$|The network prefix (the {{routing prefix}} {{combined}} with the subnet id) is contained in the most significant 64 bits of the address. The size of the routing prefix may vary; a larger prefix size means a smaller subnet id size. The bits of the subnet <b>id(entifier)</b> <b>field</b> are available to the network administrator to define subnets within the given network. The 64-bit interface identifier is either automatically generated from the interface's MAC address using the modified EUI-64 format, obtained from a DHCPv6 server, automatically established randomly, or assigned manually.|$|R
50|$|When the ARINC 429 word {{format is}} {{illustrated}} with Bit 32 to the left, the numeric representations {{in the data}} field generally read with the Most significant bit on the left. However, in this particular bit order presentation, the Label field reads with its most significant bit on the right. Like CAN Protocol <b>Identifier</b> <b>Fields,</b> ARINC 429 label fields are transmitted most significant bit first. However, like UART Protocol, Binary-coded decimal numbers and binary numbers in the ARINC 429 data fields are generally transmitted least significant bit first.|$|R
50|$|Depending on the {{specific}} router implementation, the table in which the destination address is looked up could be the routing table (also known as the routing information base, RIB), or a separate forwarding information base (FIB) that is populated (i.e., loaded) by the routing control plane, but used by the forwarding plane for look-ups at much higher speeds. Before or after examining the destination, other tables may be consulted to make decisions to drop the packet based on other characteristics, such as the source address, the IP protocol <b>identifier</b> <b>field,</b> or Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port number.|$|R
