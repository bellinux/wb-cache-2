5|$|Catherine {{states that}} Northanger Abbey looks exactly as she <b>imagined</b> <b>it</b> and she becomes {{intrigued}} by Mrs. Tilney's death. Due to her overactive imagination, Catherine starts {{to believe that}} General Tilney murdered his wife. Henry catches her in his mother's chamber and becomes offended when he realises what she has been thinking. Catherine apologises and Henry tells her that perhaps {{it is possible to}} read too many novels. Catherine receives a letter from James, in which he reveals that his engagement to Isabella has been called off, because she allowed Frederick to seduce her. Eleanor explains to Catherine that her brother has no intention of marrying Isabella. Catherine gets a letter from Isabella, asking her to apologise to James for her, but Catherine states that she will do no such thing.|$|E
5|$|He <b>imagined</b> <b>it</b> as an {{homage to}} the 1960s comic books and spy films from his boyhood and he {{initially}} tried to develop it as a 2D cel animation. When The Iron Giant became a box office bomb, he reconnected with old friend John Lasseter at Pixar in March 2000 and pitched his story idea to him. Bird and Lasseter knew each other from their college years at CalArts in the 1970s. Lasseter was sold on the idea and convinced Bird to come to Pixar, where the film would be done in computer animation. The studio announced a multi-film contract with Bird on May 4, 2000, breaking Pixar's mold of having directors who had all risen through the ranks. The Incredibles was written and directed solely by Brad Bird, a departure from previous Pixar productions which typically had two or three directors and as many screenwriters. In addition, {{it would be the}} company's first film in which all characters are human.|$|E

In a video posted April 12, 2010, Randi stated {{that he has been}} given a clean bill of health.|$|E
25|$|No {{member of}} the Committee had the {{essential}} sophistication that comes with experience {{in the trial of}} criminal cases....The high positions in the community held by the members of the Committee obscured {{the fact that they were}} not really qualified to perform the difficult task assigned to them. He also thought that the Committee, particularly Lowell, <b>imagined</b> <b>it</b> could use its fresh and more powerful analytical abilities to outperform the efforts of those who had worked on the case for years, even finding evidence of guilt that professional prosecutors had discarded.|$|E
25|$|Bookbinding is {{an artistic}} craft of great antiquity, {{and at the}} same time, a highly {{mechanized}} industry. The division between craft and industry is not so wide as might at first be <b>imagined.</b> <b>It</b> is interesting to observe that the main problems faced by the mass-production bookbinder are the same as those that confronted the medieval craftsman or the modern hand binder. The first problem is still how to hold together the pages of a book; secondly is how to cover and protect the gathering of pages once they are held together; and thirdly, how to label and decorate the protective cover.|$|E

500|$|Safire, in his {{political}} dictionary published in 2008, recollected {{that when he}} asked Moore, some years after the inauguration, whether he had really seen the girl holding the sign, or whether he had <b>imagined</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "his eyes took on a faraway look". In columns written in the final years before his 2009 death, Safire commented that the sign was [...] "almost {{too good to be}} true", and said of Moore, [...] "e may have made that up".|$|E
500|$|Kierkegaard, {{speaking}} {{in the voice of}} the upbuilding discourse at the end, says they are both wrong. They're both trying to find God in a childish way. Whatever they relate to in an external way will never make them happy or give them meaning. Art, science, dogma and ethics constantly change. We all {{want to be in the}} right and never in the wrong. Once we find what we desire we find that it wasn't what we <b>imagined</b> <b>it</b> to be. So Kierkegaard says to leave it all to God.|$|E
500|$|Orbison later {{claimed that}} the origin for [...] "In Dreams" [...] came to {{him while he was}} sleeping, as many of his songs did. He often heard music while asleep with a radio disc jockey announcing that it was Elvis Presley's new song. For this song, however, he was half awake when he <b>imagined</b> <b>it,</b> and thought, [...] "Boy that's good. I need to finish that. Too bad things don't happen in my dreams." [...] When he woke up the next morning, the entire {{composition}} was written in 20 minutes.|$|E

500|$|George Harrison's song [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] {{dates back}} to the {{recording}} sessions for his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass, and was {{one of a number of}} tracks left over from that project. In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine (1980), Harrison recalls writing the tune on an organ and, not being an accomplished keyboard player, having difficulties doing the correct fingering in both hands. It was only when his friend Klaus Voormann took over the left-hand part, to play the bass line, that he was able to hear the piece as he had <b>imagined</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
500|$|Late in 1968, after {{producing}} {{sessions in}} Los Angeles for a solo album by Apple Records signing Jackie Lomax, Harrison spent Thanksgiving {{and much of}} December in upstate New York, where he renewed his friendship with a now semi-retired Dylan and took part in informal jam sessions with the Band. According to Helm, they discussed making a possible [...] "fireside jam" [...] album with Clapton and an Apple Films [...] "rock western" [...] called Zachariah, but neither project progressed beyond the planning stage. The bucolic surroundings proved fruitful for Harrison as a songwriter, producing his first collaboration with Dylan, [...] "I'd Have You Anytime", and leading him to write [...] "All Things Must Pass". He later described the latter song as a [...] "Robbie Robertson–Band type of tune", {{and said that he}} always <b>imagined</b> <b>it</b> being sung by Helm.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Vindicator, Eric Mink {{felt that}} the episode was [...] "intense, unsettling, {{sometimes}} gross, and suspenseful {{to the point of}} nerve-racking [...] ", feeling that its plot would [...] "resonate instantly and ominously with viewers". Meghan Deans of Tor.com felt that, while the episode did unfortunately reduce Scully down to a traditional idea of feminine identity for part of its run, it was [...] "one of the most emotional Scully-centric episodes the show has ever given us." [...] Furthermore, Deans reasoned that the episode was an example of [...] "what The X-Files would have been, had Scully been the believer: a woman being told that she is hysterical, a woman being told that she <b>imagined</b> <b>it</b> all [...] a woman being told that the evidence of her own body is invalid", a direction that would have been [...] "startling [...] ".|$|E

500|$|Evolve was {{inspired}} by hunting games Cabela's Big Game Hunter and Deer Hunter. Members of Turtle Rock Studios, including Robb and Ashton, thought that the gameplay of these hunting games, such as [...] animal-tracking, was seldom incorporated in an action game. As a result, {{they came up with}} the original concept of Evolve in which, if players failed at hunting the animals, they could be attacked by their targets. Instead of typical big game animals such as elephants and lions, the team <b>imagined</b> <b>it</b> to be a [...] "King Kong", which changed to an alien monster. The team picked a sci-fi setting, allowing them to add creative and unrealistic things into the game. The team also took the concept of boss battles, and expanded upon it by using the concept as a key idea when developing Evolve. The team envisioned Evolve as a video game version of Predator. The goal of Evolve was to create an experience that was new to video game players.|$|E
500|$|In 1871, George Jenner, the {{magistrate}} of Rodrigues, collected a female specimen; it was preserved in alcohol {{and given to}} Edward Newton, a colonial administrator in Mauritius, who sent it to his brother, the British ornithologist Alfred Newton. A. Newton scientifically described the species in 1872 and gave it the scientific name Palaeornis exsul. [...] "Exsul" [...] ("exiled") refers to Leguat, in that he was exiled from France when he gave the first description of the bird. Newton had {{tried to find a}} more descriptive name, perhaps based on colouration, but found it difficult. He refrained from publishing a figure of the female in his original description, though the journal Ibis had offered him the space. He instead wanted to wait until a male specimen could be procured since he <b>imagined</b> <b>it</b> would be more attractive. The female, which is the holotype specimen of the species, is housed in the Cambridge University Museum as specimen UMZC 18/Psi/67/h/1.|$|E
500|$|Adam {{later told}} UK daily {{newspaper}} The Guardian: [...] "No one was allowed in Fort Knox but because [...] Cubby Broccoli {{had some good}} connections and the Kennedys loved Ian Fleming's books I was allowed to fly over it once. It was quite frightening - they had machine guns on the roof. I was also allowed to drive around the perimeter but if you {{got out of the}} car there was a loudspeaker warning you to keep away. There was not a chance of going in it, and I was delighted because I knew from going to the Bank of England vaults that gold isn't stacked very high and it's all underwhelming. It gave me the chance to show the biggest gold repository in the world as I <b>imagined</b> <b>it,</b> with gold going up to heaven. I came up with this cathedral-type design. I had a big job to persuade Cubby and the director Guy Hamilton at first." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by {{the cast and crew}} of The X-Files. Producer J.P. Finn praised the episode and Carter's directing, saying [...] "We were all pretty nervous doing that one, because Chris Carter was a new director. It turned out that he directed very...It was a great script, a great cast, and he ended up directing a home run. One of the charming things about it was the end, where we had these alien heads placed on young children. It was so endearing to see them on the set between takes, playing with Chris and everyone". Actor David Duchovny said of Carter's directing [...] "Chris came in meticulously prepared, which is his nature. I think his first episode was great". Carter himself described it as one of his favorite episodes because [...] "it was a chance for me to sort of do it all, and it came out in ways better than I <b>imagined</b> <b>it</b> would".|$|E
500|$|During the game's planning, it {{was decided}} that it should not be {{directly}} connected to Shin Megami Tensei, ensuring that it would hold interest independent from the first game; because of this, Kaneko envisioned it as a story loosely based on Shin Megami Tenseis future. At first, he <b>imagined</b> <b>it</b> to take place ten years after the first game, as he thought that would be roughly the amount of time needed for society to rebuild, but another staff member wanted it to take place hundreds of years later. Kaneko disagreed, saying that culture would have changed a lot over a hundred years, and that he could not even imagine what the world would look like a hundred years into the future or what it had been like during the Meiji period. The two had different ideas about the timeline of the series, but eventually decided to set the game [...] "several decades" [...] after Shin Megami Tensei. They made use of the tree of life as a central theme of the story.|$|E
500|$|On {{his first}} day of filming, in July 2006, Thompson—who grew up {{watching}} Coronation Street—was starstruck. [...] " [...] was the strangest {{day of my life}} because I was in a room with all these famous people." [...] He added: [...] "It was completely different to how I <b>imagined</b> <b>it</b> would be. Everyone's been really nice to me and it's going well." [...] Prior to the airing of the Connor family's arrival on the famous cobblestone street in August 2006, Thompson commented, [...] "I can't say too much about Ryan and the story lines, but he's very mischievous. The character is not a bad lad, but he's not a good lad either." [...] Garth Philips, series producer, said at the time, [...] "We held extensive casting sessions to get this family right, and the energy that Sean, Rob, Kym and Ben have will certainly make them a joy to watch on screen." [...] He continued, [...] "They're a twenty-first century Coronation Street family, and we hope our viewers will be as enthralled and excited by them as we are." ...|$|E
