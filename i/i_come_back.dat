After completing the penultimate verse, Mercury had told the band he [...] "wasn't feeling that great" [...] and stated, [...] "I will finish it when <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> next time." [...] However, he never made {{it back into the}} studio, so May later recorded the final verse of the song.|$|E
500|$|While Hurley {{had been}} able to command Friday's respect, {{it soon became clear that}} Andrews was unable to control him and that the Londoner disliked his new manager. Indeed, soon after moving to Cardiff, Friday {{appeared}} one day in Hurley's office at Elm Park asking to come back to Reading. [...] "He still called me boss", Hurley recalled. [...] "I can't play for that little bastard", Friday told Hurley, referring to Andrews. [...] "You're the one who seems to be able to get me right. Can <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to you?" [...] Hurley replied that although he would be happy to have Friday back on the team, the club could not afford to repay the £28,000 transfer fee to Cardiff, so he would have to go back and continue playing there. Unhappy living so far from home, Friday began to travel back to London at weekends; he avoided paying rail fares by knocking on locked toilet doors and shouting, [...] "Tickets, please!", pretending to be the ticket inspector. When the occupant passed his ticket under the door to be checked, Friday would pick it up, walk off and use it for himself. Paul Went also recalled an incident during training when he had thrown a ball out from goal and accidentally hit Friday on the back of the head. A player standing near the forward started laughing, leading Friday to conclude that he had thrown the ball. Friday viciously punched the laughing player in the jaw, striking him with such force that he wore a neck brace for two weeks afterwards.|$|E

The album reached No. 1 on the UK charts immediately following its release, and has sold 20 million copies worldwide. On 25 November 1996, a statue of Mercury was unveiled in Montreux overlooking Lake Geneva, almost five years to the day since his death.|$|E
2500|$|In Gillette's rented room, {{authorities}} confiscated Brown's {{love letters}} to Gillette as evidence. District attorney George Ward read the letters aloud {{to the court}} during the trial {{in the fall of}} 1906, and Brown's letters gave the trial national attention. Brown pleaded with Gillette in the letters to accept responsibility for her condition, the pregnancy. In her final letter, written July 5, Brown looked forward to her impending Adirondack trip with Gillette, and she said farewell to her childhood home of South Otselic, wishing she could confess her pregnancy to her mother: [...] "I know I shall never see any of them again. And mamma! Great heavens, how I do love Mamma! I don't know what I shall do without her (...) Sometimes I think if I could tell mamma, but I can't. She has trouble enough as it is, and I couldn't break her heart like that. If <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> dead, perhaps if she does not know, she won't be angry with me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lyrics on {{the album}} deal with various subjects. [...] "Raised on Rock" [...] is a song about Scorpions' {{philosophy}} of life. Meine explained [...] "We all started listening the music and growing up with the music back in the 60s". Schenker also added [...] ""Raised on Rock" [...] is our soundtrack {{and it will be}} our soundtrack until the end of our days. It's the reason why we formed the band." [...] Songs [...] "Let's Rock", [...] "Rock Zone" [...] and [...] "Spirit of Rock" [...] deal with the same subject. [...] "Sting in the Tail" [...] is a song about attitude and as Schenker said [...] "it is really a great symbol of what the Scorpions are all about". [...] "The Good Die Young" [...] is an anti-war song about soldiers in Afghanistan and all the people around the world who stand for freedom and peace. Meine explained [...] "We all live in trouble times. I think that song is trying to express that kind of feeling". Lyrics for the song were inspired by the conversation between Meine and his friend who was preparing to go to Afghanistan for eight months. Meine said: [...] "In between the lines I could hear, 'Well, let’s hope <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> home alive'." [...] "Lorelei" [...] is a song about the legend of the water-spirit Lorelei who lives {{on the top of the}} rock Loreley above the river Rhine. [...] "SLY" [...] is the fictional song about a girl named Sly. Meine explained [...] "When [...] "Still Loving You" [...] was a smash hit back in the '80s, many folks made love to that song, obviously. Many people told us in Europe, especially France, 'We called our daughter Sly because of Still Loving You'" ...|$|E
