5|$|The {{reason for}} this {{grouping}} is unclear; they certainly cannot be attributed to an attempt to match {{the lay of the}} river bed.

5|$|A {{folklore}} {{story is}} {{also associated with}} Sakurai Genbei, who was Ikeda Terumasa's master carpenter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> keep.

Eventually, he became distraught and {{climbed to the top of}} the keep, where he jumped to his death with a chisel in his mouth.|$|E
5|$|Above is the Great Chamber, an {{impressive}} {{room with a}} barrel ceiling with geometrical plaster decoration featuring John Lyte's arms and those of his wife, Edith Horsey. This ceiling is a rare survival. The wall above the bed displays the royal coat of arms and Tudor roses, signifying Lyte's loyalty to King Henry VIII (whose government Lyte represented in Somerset). The panelling is 17th century, as are the great four poster bed and the tapestries on the walls.

5|$|As {{initially}} envisioned, the Hanlon Expressway will be {{upgraded to}} a controlled-access highway by removing all existing at-grade intersections {{and improving the}} highway to 400-series standards. Planning for this work initially {{began in the early}} 1990s with the EA for the section north of the Speed River, which resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wellington Street interchange. The EA for the section south of the Speed River began in early 2007. The Laird Road interchange and associated closing of the Clair Road intersection were the first projects completed as part of this work.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} the stops on the Westside MAX, {{displays}} of public artwork were included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stop. Overall the artwork at the station reflects the gathering and dispersal of people and the harvest. Christine Bourdette, a sculptor, working with the architects from OTAK designed some of the artwork at Hatfield Station. Described as a “clash of sensibilities” and “organically abstract”, items include sculptures of bronze baskets and granite balls installed {{at the southern end}} of the station. Attached to the station's building is a bronze work entitled “Gathering Rail” which resembles twine woven together and is intended to represent the various themes of the community coming together.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the {{concession}} was given construction of the railway had already started. At the most 2,000 workers were involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plant, the Rjukan Line, and the Tinnoset Line. This was {{in addition to the}} Svelgfoss Power Station and a new potassium nitrate factory in Notodden. During the construction one worker lost his life in a landslide, while two survived the accident. Housing was provided in simple barracks, and few laborers came with family. Prostitution and the sale of illegal liquor during the prohibition flourished; the lack of proper law enforcement making Vestfjorddalen known as a lawless valley.|$|E

5|$|Following the Norman {{conquest of}} England in 1066, Ernulf de Hesdin {{was given the}} manor of Ruislip, which {{included}} the woods, in recognition of his service to William the Conqueror. In 1087, Ernulf de Hesdin passed the manor to the Bec Abbey. During the Abbey's ownership, timber from the woods was used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tower of London in 1339, Windsor Castle in 1344, the Palace of Westminster in 1346 and the manor of the Black Prince in Kennington. Locally, the Great Barn on the Manor Farm site was constructed of oak from the woods. King's College, Cambridge became lords of the manor in 1451.|$|E
5|$|Huston {{designed}} the large bronze {{doors at the}} capitol's main entrance. They were modeled by sculptor Otto Jahnsen and were both cast in one piece using the lost wax method of casting by the Henry Bonnard Bronze Company. The doors are decorated with scenes {{from the history of}} Pennsylvania, such as the arrival of William Penn and his peace treaty with the Lenape. Busts of people who were important <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capitol, like Governor Pennypacker, Boies Penrose, and Matthew Quay, decorate the edges of the doors. The bust of Huston hides the doors' keyhole.|$|E

In 1964, ESRO was established as a Western European reaction to the rapidly developing Soviet and American space programs. Norway chose to only join as an observer, partially because of the close {{cooperation with the}} US and partially because of the cost. However, Norwegian space research scientists participated in ESRO programs.|$|E
5|$|In {{their design}} of the reductions, the Jesuits were {{inspired}} by “ideal cities“ as outlined in works such as Utopia and Arcadia, written respectively by the 16th-century English philosophers Thomas More and Philip Sidney. The Jesuits had specific criteria for building sites: locations with plenty of wood for construction; sufficient water for the population; good soil for agriculture; and safety from flooding during the rainy season. Although most of the missions in the Chiquitania were relocated at least once {{during the time of}} the Jesuits, four of ten towns remained at their original sites. Wood and adobe were the main materials used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> settlements.|$|E
5|$|Living nativity {{scenes are}} not without their problems. In the United States in 2008, for example, vandals {{destroyed}} all eight scenes and backdrops at a drive-through living nativity scene in Georgia. About 120 of the church’s 500 members were involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scenes or playing roles in the production. The damage was estimated at more than US$2,000. Additionally, the use of real animals in living nativity scenes has provoked complaint.|$|E
