He works as a fry cook at a local fast food restaurant, the Krusty Krab, to which he is obsessively attached. At work, SpongeBob answers to Eugene Krabs, a greedy crab who shows SpongeBob favor, alongside his ill-tempered, snobbish next-door neighbor Squidward Tentacles. His hobbies include jellyfishing, practicing karate at an <b>elementary</b> <b>level,</b> and blowing bubbles.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh drew, {{and painted}} with watercolours while at school, {{but only a}} few {{examples}} survive and the authorship of some has been challenged. When he took up art as an adult, he began at an <b>elementary</b> <b>level.</b> In early 1882, his uncle, Cornelis Marinus, owner of a well-known gallery of contemporary art in Amsterdam, asked for drawings of The Hague. Van Gogh's work did not live up to expectations. Marinus offered a second commission, specifying the subject matter in detail, but was again disappointed with the result. Van Gogh persevered; he experimented with lighting in his studio using variable shutters, and with different drawing materials. For more than a year he worked on single figures– highly elaborate studies in black and white, which at the time gained him only criticism. Later, they were recognised as early masterpieces.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper aims to {{investigate}} {{the extent to which}} translation is useful in Foreign Language Teaching for adult learners at <b>elementary</b> <b>levels.</b> Although the effectiveness of translation has been questioned, this study presents reasons why a language teacher should resort to this tool.   The research drew on data collected from written translation exercises of elementary learners at a language center in the city of Londrina, Brazil, in 2009. The exercises were analyzed by examining the occurrence and disappearance of errors lesson by lesson. The results demonstrated that the act of translating fosters learning.

25|$|Education in Eritrea {{is officially}} {{compulsory}} between seven and 13 years of age. However, the education infrastructure is inadequate to meet current needs. Statistics vary at the <b>elementary</b> <b>level,</b> suggesting that between 65 and 70% of school-aged children attend primary school; Approximately 61% attend secondary school. Student-teacher ratios are high: 45 to 1 at the <b>elementary</b> <b>level</b> and 54 to 1 {{at the secondary}} level. There are an average 63 students per classroom at the <b>elementary</b> <b>level</b> and 97 per classroom at the secondary level. Learning hours at school are often less than six hours per day. The literacy rate in Eritrea is high. For men in the age 18–24 the literacy rate is 92.6% in (2008–2012), {{for women in the}} age 18–24 the literacy rate is 87.7% (2008–2012) The literacy rate for the total population is 81%,. Barriers to education in Eritrea include traditional taboos, school fees (for registration and materials), and the opportunity costs of low-income households.|$|E

25|$|Within the {{national}} {{public school system}} are a few magnet type/charter public high schools. Admissions are very selective, reserved for students who demonstrate outstanding academic achievement and potential at the <b>elementary</b> <b>level,</b> Year/Standard 1 through 6.

25|$|The third {{prevalent}} {{issue the}} Philippine educational system continuously encounters is the affordability of education (or lack thereof). A big disparity in educational achievements is evident across various social groups. Socioeconomically disadvantaged students {{otherwise known as}} students {{who are members of}} high and low-income poverty-stricken families, have immensely higher drop-out rates in the <b>elementary</b> <b>level.</b> Additionally, most freshmen students at the tertiary level come from relatively well-off families.|$|E

(2006) {{were able to}} {{demonstrate}} how explicit critical thinking instruction, combined with inherently thought-provoking content, could improve critical thinking dispositions, skills, and strategies among Grade Eight students. Another study by Gunn (2007) found that expository comprehension text of science was significantly improved when university {{students were asked to}} create critical thinking questions regarding the heart disease text using the six generic question stems. Research evidence has indicated the importance of critical thinking in science lessons and infusing critical thinking should start at the <b>elementary</b> <b>levels.</b> By engaging students in critical thinking from the <b>elementary</b> <b>levels,</b> science educators can lay the foundation for proficient and ethical consumers of scientific change (Gunn et al. 2007).|$|R
