Average current {{in the single}} <b>harmonic</b> <b>ring</b> reaches 2. 5 A at extraction, with peak current of 13 A.

In this model, each node u is given an additional D_u edges, a degree chosen from a specified probability distribution. Each such edge from u is linked to a random node at distance r ahead in the ring with probability proportional to 1 /r, a "harmonic" distance distribution of contacts. Aspnes et al. (2002) have shown an O(^ 2 n / ℓ) bound on the expected length of greedy routes in the case when each node is assigned exactly ℓ contacts and, {{as a consequence of}} recent work by Dietzfelbinger and Woelfel (2009), this bound is known to be tight.

One {{of the interests}} of these rings resides in {{the fact that we have}} an equivalence of categories between vector bundles over a compact manifold and finitely generated projective modules over C(M), the ring of continuous real functions on M [17]. These rings have been studied by R. Bkouche (soft rings [3]) C. J. Mulvey (Gelfand rings [15]) and S. Teleman (<b>harmonic</b> <b>rings</b> [19]). Firstly we study these rings geometrically (by sheaves of modules (Theorem 2. 5)) and then introduce the Čech covering dimension of their maximal spectrums. This allows us to study the stable rank of such a ring A (Theorem 6. 1), the nilpotence of the nilideal of K 0 (A) - The Grothendieck group of the category of finitely generated projective A-modules - (Theorem 9. 3), and an upper limit on the maximal number of generators of a finitely generated A-module as a function of the afore-mentioned dimension (Theorem 4. 4). Moreover theorems of stability are established for the group K 0 (A), depending on the stable rank (Theorems 8. 1 and 8. 2). They can be compared to those for vector bundles over a finite dimensional paracompact space [18]. Thus there is an analogy between finitely generated projective modules over Gelfand rings and Čech dimension, and finitely generated projective modules over noetherian rings and Krull dimension...|$|R

This dissertation concerns the development of novel Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) methodologies based which would rotate the magnetic field instead of the sample, rotating field NMR. It provides an over of the NMR concepts, procedures, and experiments needed to understand the methodologies {{that will be used}} for rotating field NMR. A simple two-dimensional shimming method based on <b>harmonic</b> corrector <b>rings</b> which can provide arbitrary multiple order shimming corrections were developed for rotating field systems, but could be used in shimming other systems as well. Those results demonstrate, for example, that quadrupolar order shimming improves the linewidth by up to an order of magnitude. An additional order of magnitude reduction is in principle achievable by utilizing this shimming method for z-gradient correction and higher order xy gradients. A specialized pulse sequence for the rotating field NMR experiment is under development. The pulse sequence allows for spinning away from the magic angle and spinning slower than the anisotropic broadening. This pulse sequence is a combination of the projected magic angle spinning (p-MAS) and magic angle turning (MAT) pulse sequences. This will be useful to rotating field NMR because there are limits on how fast a field can be spun and spin at the magic angle is difficult. One of the goals of this project is for rotating field NMR to be used on biological systems. The p-MAS pulse sequence was successfully tested on bovine tissue samples which suggests {{that it will be a}} viable methodology to use in a rotating field set up.

If the oscillator cavity length is relativistically corrected to be an <b>harmonic</b> of the <b>ring</b> circumference (LC=βLRn=n B with nB the number of bunches), higher-energy, secondary photons from Compton backscattering may become significant.

40|$|In future fiber-optic {{communication}} systems, it will {{be important}} to increase the transmission capacity. Wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) is a technology which can expand the bandwidth of already existing fiber transmission networks by multiplexing multiple optical carrier signals on a single optical fiber. However, current WDM network system uses a single laser source for each wavelength channel, requiring dedicated wavelength control and thermal management. This complexity comes at a significant cost. A very attractive solution to minimize the complexity is to use a multiwavelength laser source. In this PhD thesis work, we proposed and demonstrated various schemes of multiwavelength ring laser sources, which can be potentially used in future WDM systems. Stable optical dual wavelength mode-locked operation is achieved in a fiber laser by using nonlinear polarization rotation (NPR) in a highly nonlinear fiber (HNF) or gain distribution in a dispersion compensating fiber (DCF). In addition, a multiwavelength passively mode-locked laser is also demonstrated.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a novel ring laser {{platform}} is presented {{that uses a}} single active element, a semiconductor optical ampli-fier (SOA), to provide both gain and gain modulation in the optical cavity. Gain modulation is achieved by an externally introduced op-tical pulsed signal. This signal periodically saturates the amplifier gain and forces the ring laser to mode lock. Using this laser plat-form, we demonstrate picosecond pulsetrain generation at repeti-tion rates up to 40 GHz, either in single or multiwavelength oper-ation mode. In particular, using rational harmonic mode locking, 2. 5 -ps pulses were obtained up to a 40 -GHz repetition rate, while output pulses and output power were constant over a 20 -nm tuning range. In addition, a multiwavelength optical signal was obtained using the same laser platform {{with the addition of}} a Fabry–Pérot filter for comb generation. Multiwavelength oscillation is possible due to the broad gain spectrum of the SOA used and its inhomoge-neous line broadening. To this end, 48 oscillating wavelengths were obtained at the laser output, with 50 -GHz line spacing. Combining both modes of operation, it was possible to mode lock the oscillating multiwavelength signal and to obtain at the output ten wavelength channels, simultaneously mode locked at a 30 -GHz repetition rate. The mode-locked channels are temporarily synchronized and ex-hibit almost identical spectral and time characteristics.
