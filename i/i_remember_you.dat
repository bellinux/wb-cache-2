2500|$|Thicke's demo {{made its}} way to R artist Brian McKnight, who was {{impressed}} enough by Thicke to invite him into the studio to work with him. Thicke was signed to McKnight's production company; [...] "Anyway", a song co-written with Thicke, was featured on McKnight's second album <b>I</b> <b>Remember</b> <b>You.</b> Thicke's peers jokingly nicknamed him [...] "Brian McWhite". It was Thicke's association with McKnight, who Thicke counts as one of his first mentors, that led him to his acquaintance with Jimmy Iovine and helped him to land his first recording contract with Interscope Records at the age of 16. Thicke moved out on his own at age 17, during his senior year of high school, earning a living and supporting himself as a professional record producer and songwriter. Thicke has noted that while his parents did not attempt to dissuade him from his desire to be in the music industry, their own experience with the nature of the entertainment business made them leery in the beginning. As Thicke's list of credits grew so did his parents' confidence in his decision.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{talks about the}} end of Adele's first [...] "real relationship" [...] with her long-time friend and lover and it shows her confronting his marriage. At the {{beginning}} of the song, she sings the lines [...] "I heard that you're settled down/That you found a girl and you're married now. I heard that your dreams came true/Guess she gave you things I [...] couldn't give to you" [...] with a softly voice and accompanied just by a simple piano melody. The lyrics of [...] "Someone like You" [...] are talking about what once was and what could have been as stated by a writer of Daily Herald. Finding the strength to bounce back from hardship and heartache, Adele sings the lines, [...] "Never mind, I'll find someone like you. I wish nothing but the best for you, too/Don't forget me, I beg, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>you</b> said/Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead." [...] Talking about the meaning and the composition of the song, Jer Fairall of PopMatters said: [...] "The song's subject—Adele mentally addressing an old lover who has since found happiness elsewhere—is familiar, but the detail she colors it with are vibrantly tactile and resonant, from the sense-memory setting of 'we were born and raised in a summer haze' to her recollection of his cruel kiss-off line 'I remember you said, 'sometimes it lasts in love and sometimes it hurts instead' and how she comes to take solace in the statement as an empowering mantra." ...|$|E
