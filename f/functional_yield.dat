This evaluation has been done on model molecular systems for which precise experimental data are available and reference post-Hartree-Fock calculations (CCSD(T) using large basis sets) are feasible. The results show that when the rare gas atom shares density with the neighbouring atoms, the GGA <b>functionals</b> <b>yield</b> good geometries and qualitatively correct binding energies, even if these are quite significantly overestimated.

40|$|Abstract — Carbon {{nanotube}} {{field effect}} transistors (CNFETs) show great promise as extensions to silicon CMOS. However, imperfections, which are mainly related to carbon nanotubes (CNTs) growth process, result in metallic and nonuniform CNTs leading to significant <b>functional</b> <b>yield</b> reduction. This paper presents a comprehensive technique for statistical <b>functional</b> <b>yield</b> estimation and enhancement of CNFET-based VLSI circuits. Based on experimental data extracted from aligned CNTs, we propose a compact statistical model {{to estimate the}} failure probability of a CNFET. Using the proposed failure model, we show that enhancing the CNT synthesis process alone cannot achieve acceptable <b>functional</b> <b>yield</b> for upcoming CNFET-based VLSI circuits. We propose a technique {{which is based on}} replacing each transistor by series-parallel transistor structures to reduce the failure probability of CNFETs in the presence of metallic and nonuniform CNTs. The technique is adapted to use single directional independence, which is inherent in aligned CNTs, to enhance the <b>functional</b> <b>yield</b> as validated by theoretical analysis and simulation results. Tradeoffs between failure probability reduction and design overheads such as area and current drive are explored. As demonstrated by extensive simulation results, the proposed technique achieves 80 % <b>functional</b> <b>yield</b> in CNFET technology at the cost of 7. 5 X area and 34 % current drive overheads if the CNT density and the fraction of semiconducting CNTs are improved to 200 CNTs per µm and 99. 99 %, respectively.

40|$|Silicon based {{integrated}} circuit (IC) technology is approaching its physical limits. For sub 10 nm technology nodes, the carbon nanotube (CNT) based {{field effect transistor}} {{has emerged as a}} promising device because of its excellent electronic properties. One of the major challenges faced by the CNT technology is the unwanted growth of metallic tubes. At present, there is no known CNT fabrication technology which allows the fabrication of 100 % semiconducting CNTs. The presence of metallic tubes creates a short between the drain and source terminals of the transistor and has a detrimental impact on the delay, static power and yield of CNT based gates. This thesis will address the challenge of designing robust carbon nanotube based circuits in the presence of metallic tubes. For a small percentage of metallic tubes, circuit level solutions are proposed to increase the <b>functional</b> <b>yield</b> of CNT based gates in the presence of metallic tubes. Accurate analytical models with less than a 3 % inaccuracy rate are developed to estimate the yield of CNT based circuit for a different percentage of metallic tubes and different drive strengths of logic gates. Moreover, a design methodology is developed for yield-aware carbon nanotube based circuits in the presence of metallic tubes using different CNFET transistor configurations. Architecture based on regular logic bricks with underlying hybrid CNFET configurations are developed which gives better trade-offs in terms of performance, power, and <b>functional</b> <b>yield.</b> In the case when the percentage of metallic tubes is large, the proposed circuit level techniques are not sufficient. Extra processing techniques must be applied to remove the metallic tubes. The tube removal techniques have trade-offs, as the removal process is not perfect and removes semiconducting tubes in addition to removing unwanted metallic tubes. As a result, stochastic removal of tubes from the drive and fanout gate(s) results in large variation in the performance of CNFET based gates and in the worst case open circuit gates. A Monte Carlo simulation engine is developed to estimate the impact of the removal of tubes on the performance and power of CNFET based logic gates. For a quick estimation of <b>functional</b> <b>yield</b> of logic gates, accurate analytical models are developed to estimate the <b>functional</b> <b>yield</b> of logic gates when a fraction of the tubes are removed. An efficient tube level redundancy (TLR) is proposed, resulting in a high <b>functional</b> <b>yield</b> of carbon nanotube based circuits with minimal overheads in terms of area and power when large fraction of tubes are removed. Furthermore, for applications where parallelism can be utilized we propose to increase the <b>functional</b> <b>yield</b> of the CNFET based circuits by increasing the logic depth of gates...|$|E
