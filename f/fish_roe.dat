5|$|The region spans a {{wide variety}} of {{cultures}} with distinct cuisines, in particular (going anticlockwise around the region) the Maghrebi, Levantine, Ottoman (Turkish), Greek, Italian, Provençal (French), Spanish, and Portuguese. However, the historical connections of the region, as well as the impact of the Mediterranean Sea on the region's climate and economy, mean that these cuisines share dishes beyond the core trio of oil, bread, and wine, such as roast lamb or mutton, meat stews with vegetables and tomato (for example, Spanish andrajos and Italian ciambotta), and the salted cured <b>fish</b> <b>roe,</b> bottarga, found across the region. Spirits based on anise are drunk in many countries around the Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|Malacca had few {{domestic}} products {{with which to}} trade. It produced small amounts of tin and gold as well as dried fish, yet even the salt for preserving the fish had to be sourced from elsewhere in the region. Basic goods, including vegetables, cattle and fish, were supplied by Malacca's trading partners. Rice, mainly for local consumption, was imported. Much of the mercantile activity in Malacca, therefore, relied on the flow of goods {{from other parts of}} the region. Among Malacca's most crucial functions was its role as both a collection centre for cloves, nutmeg and mace from the Spice Islands and a redistribution centre for cotton textiles from ports in Gujarat, the Coromandel Coast, Malabar Coast and Bengal. Other goods traded in Malacca included porcelain, silk and iron from China and natural products of the Malay archipelago, such as camphor, sandalwood, spices, fish, <b>fish</b> <b>roe</b> and seaweed. From the coastal regions on both sides of Malacca Straits came forest products; rattan, resin, roots and wax, and some gold and tin. These goods were then shipped to ports west of Malacca especially Gujarat.|$|E
500|$|Julia Moskin {{wrote about}} New Nordic cuisine, chef Paul Berglund and the Bachelor Farmer, and the {{restaurants}} La Loma, Tilia, the Red Stag Supper Club, Fika and Haute Dish in The New York Times in 2012. She said Minneapolis chefs served trendy Nordic ingredients like root vegetables, <b>fish</b> <b>roe,</b> wild greens, venison, dried mushrooms, seaweed and cow's milk. Two months later, Bon Appétit featured the Bachelor Farmer, Piccolo, Saffron, Salty Tart, and Smack Shack/1029 Bar, writing about New Nordic cuisine and the Scandinavian heritage of Minneapolis. In 2012 Food & Wine magazine named Minneapolis the nation's best and best-priced new food city. In 2015, profiling chef Gavin Kaysen and Spoon and Stable, Saveur named Minneapolis [...] "the next great American food city." [...] Then, Food & Wine voted Spoon and Stable {{one of five}} 2015 restaurants of the year. Minneapolis is noted for its East African cuisine due to a wave of Somali immigration which started in the 1990s.|$|E
40|$|Two microbound diets (MBD) {{containing}} marine <b>fish</b> <b>roes</b> {{were assessed}} as weaning diets for Asian sea bass/barramundi (Lates calcarifer) over a 5 -d growth trial. The larvae were successfully weaned {{on the two}} MBD tested which supported greater growth than a commercially available weaning diet developed for European bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) which is currently used as a weaning diet in commercial culture of L. calcarifer in Australia. The results indicate that marine <b>fish</b> <b>roes</b> are a suitable basis for weaning diets for L. calcarifer, and that MBD are a suitable way of presenting these diets. The inexpensive and easily prepared MBD {{used in this study}} may therefore represent a viable alternative to the commercial diets currently available to marine finfish hatcheries...|$|R
50|$|In Odisha and West Bengal, roe {{of several}} fresh-water fish, {{including}} hilsa, are eaten, the roe being cooked separately or {{along with the}} fish, the latter method being preferred for all but large <b>fishes.</b> <b>Roe,</b> either light or deep-fried are also eaten as snacks or appetizers before a major meal.|$|R

500|$|While animal {{products}} {{were to be}} avoided during times of penance, pragmatic compromises often prevailed. The definition of [...] "fish" [...] was often extended to marine and semi-aquatic animals such as whales, barnacle geese, puffins and even beavers. The choice of ingredients may have been limited, {{but that did not}} mean that meals were smaller. Neither were there any restrictions against (moderate) drinking or eating sweets. Banquets held on fish days could be splendid, and were popular occasions for serving illusion food that imitated meat, cheese and eggs in various ingenious ways; fish could be moulded to look like venison and fake eggs could be made by stuffing empty egg shells with <b>fish</b> <b>roe</b> and almond milk and cooking them in coals. While Byzantine church officials took a hard-line approach, and discouraged any culinary refinement for the clergy, their Western counterparts were far more lenient. There was also no lack of grumbling about the rigours of fasting among the laity. During Lent, kings and schoolboys, commoners and nobility, all complained about being deprived of meat for the long, hard weeks of solemn contemplation of their sins. At Lent, owners of livestock were even warned to {{keep an eye out for}} hungry dogs frustrated by a [...] "hard siege by Lent and fish bones".|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to meat, products of forbidden species and from unhealthy animals were {{banned by the}} Talmudic writers. This included eggs (including <b>fish</b> <b>roe)</b> and milk, as well as derived products such as cheese and jelly, but did not include materials merely [...] "manufactured" [...] or [...] "gathered" [...] by animals, such as honey (although, {{in the case of}} honey from animals other than bees, there was a difference of opinion among the ancient writers). According to the rabbinical writers, eggs from ritually pure animals would always be prolate ("pointy") at one end and oblate ("rounded") at the other, helping to reduce uncertainty about whether consumption was permitted or not.|$|E

40|$|Thousands {{of aquatic}} animal species, {{some of which}} affect our lives {{directly}} andlor indirectly, have been listed as poisonous or venomous. Marine animals which are important as food sources in the Indo-Pacific region often cause poisoning. Puffer fish poisoning, ciguatera poisoning and paralytic shellfish poisoning present the most serious problems for the fishing industry, {{as well as for}} the food hygienist and have been studied extensively for the past twenty years. Poisonings from <b>fish</b> <b>roes</b> and wax-rich <b>fish</b> are also worthy of note. Marine toxins are known to be synthesized by the causative organisms or to be accu-mulated through food chains; they are not bacterial in origin. On the other hand, some marine organisms are known to cause environmental damage such as mass mortalities of commercially important fish and shellfish. In this review, the current state of our biological and chemical knowledge of these toxins is presented...|$|R

Fish and other edible marine products - primarily <b>fish,</b> shellfish, <b>roe</b> and seaweeds - constitute for populations living along the coast the main elements of the local cultural diets, norms and traditions.
