5|$|Brakk was {{a primal}} zerg pack leader on Zerus. When Sarah Kerrigan arrived on Zerus, Brakk {{declared}} that her zerg intruded on his territory. Wishing {{to stop her}} from waking Zurvan, he sent <b>his</b> <b>pack</b> to destroy the quillgor meat that her drones were harvesting. When this was unsuccessful, he personally led an attack on her hive cluster and was killed. The remnants of Brakk's pack were destroyed shortly afterwards by Yagdra's pack.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of June 6, 1944, American {{soldiers}} land on Omaha Beach {{as part of the}} Normandy Invasion. They suffer heavy losses in assaulting German positions defended by artillery and machine guns. Captain John H. Miller of the 2nd Ranger Battalion assembles a group to penetrate the German defenses, leading to a breakout from the beach. Elsewhere on the beach, a dead soldier is face down in the bloody surf; <b>his</b> <b>pack</b> is stenciled Ryan,S.|$|E
5|$|On {{her way to}} Trawden Forest, Demdike's granddaughter, Alizon Device, {{encountered}} John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, {{and asked}} him for some pins. Seventeenth-century metal pins were handmade and relatively expensive, but they were frequently needed for magical purposes, such as in healing – particularly for treating warts – divination, and for love magic, {{which may have been}} why Alizon was so keen to get hold of them and why Law was so reluctant to sell them to her. Whether she meant to buy them, as she claimed, and Law refused to undo <b>his</b> <b>pack</b> for such a small transaction, or whether she had no money and was begging for them, as Law's son Abraham claimed, is unclear. A few minutes after their encounter Alizon saw Law stumble and fall, perhaps because he suffered a stroke; he managed to regain his feet and reach a nearby inn. Initially Law made no accusations against Alizon, but she appears to have been convinced of her own powers; when Abraham Law took her to visit his father {{a few days after the}} incident, she reportedly confessed and asked for his forgiveness.|$|E

5|$|Ash soon {{comes to}} realize that the Pikachu refuses to go inside his Poké Ball and prefers his independence. As Ash carries the {{reluctant}} Pikachu, he hopes that they can be friends, but Pikachu acts aloof and openly shows his distrust of Ash. Just then, the two stumble upon a Pidgey in the wild and Ash unsuccessfully tries to catch it by throwing a Poké Ball. Ash uses his Pokédex and finds out that in order to catch a Pokémon, a trainer must first use their Pokémon to battle it, thereby weakening it, to be caught by a Poké Ball. With Pikachu being uncooperative, Ash tries to fight the Pidgey himself, but is easily beaten, which greatly amuses Pikachu. The Pidgey escapes and Ash finds a Rattata rummaging through <b>his</b> <b>pack.</b> He chases the Pokémon off as he hears cooing behind him. He turns to see several Pidgey gathered in the tall grass. Frustrated, Ash throws a rock at what he believes is the Pidgey. However, {{it turns out to be}} a Spearow, which starts attacking Pikachu and Ash. Pikachu shocks Spearow, and in the process alerts a whole flock. The angered Spearow flock gives chase and eventually catches up and attacks Pikachu. Ash quickly grabs Pikachu and dives down a waterfall in order to escape from the flock of Spearow, and the two are fished out down river by a young girl named Misty, who tells Ash to take the injured Pikachu to the Pokémon Center in Viridian City. Seeing the Spearow flock approaching, Ash escapes with Pikachu taking Misty's bike.|$|E
25|$|Reinvigorated by the advice, Patchi {{returns to}} the herd, only to find them under attack by Gorgon and <b>his</b> <b>pack</b> again. As Gorgon overpowers him in battle, a repentant Scowler orders Patchi to save himself and lead the herd to safety. Instead, Patchi leads them in driving off Gorgon and <b>his</b> <b>pack</b> for good, saving Scowler. Scowler reconciles with Patchi and then concedes {{leadership}} of the herd to him, and Patchi goes on to have eggs with Juniper, one of which hatches and Alex asks {{for it to be}} named after him. In the present day, moved by Alex's story, Ricky returns the Gorgosaurus tooth to Zack and Jade, who have unknowingly discovered Gorgon's skull.|$|E
25|$|From 1806 to 1816, Smith was Master of the Quorn Hunt in Leicestershire, {{then from}} 1816 to 1824 of the Burton hounds in Lincolnshire. He {{established}} <b>his</b> <b>pack</b> at Penton, near Andover, in 1826. In 1834 he bought many of Sir Thomas Burghley's hounds and in 1842 the whole pack of the Duke of Grafton. He hunted his hounds {{four days a}} week and sometimes had two packs out on the same day. In 1830, {{after the death of his}} father, he moved his stable and kennels to Tedworth House.|$|E

25|$|According to the Masters of Foxhounds Association of America, Englishman Robert Brooke was {{the first}} man to import hunting hounds to America, {{bringing}} <b>his</b> <b>pack</b> of foxhounds to Maryland in 1650 along with his horses. Also around this time, numbers of European red foxes were introduced into the Eastern seaboard of North America for hunting. The first organised hunt for the benefit of a group (rather than a single patron) was started by Thomas, sixth Lord Fairfax in 1747. In the United States, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson both kept packs of fox hounds before and after the American Revolutionary War.|$|E
25|$|After a while, the {{old lady}} {{returned}} to the cave and noticed Yūkei's departure, whereupon her appearance transformed into that of a fearsome onibaba and then started to give chase at a furious speed. The onibaba caught up and was right behind Yūkei. In this time of desperation, Yūkei took out his statue of Nyoirin Kan'non Bosatsu (a form of Guanyin) from <b>his</b> <b>pack</b> and started to desperately chant a sutra. As he did so, the Bosatsu statue started to dance up into the sky, forming a shining demon-slaying pure white bow and a vajra (indestructible substance) arrow that shot and slew the onibaba.|$|E
25|$|One day, {{during the}} dry season, the jungle animals gather to drink the water that remains {{as part of a}} truce during a drought that enables the jungle's {{wildlife}} to drink without fear of being eaten by their predators. The truce is disrupted when a scarred tiger named Shere Khan arrives detecting Mowgli's scent in the large crowd. Resentful against man for scarring him, he issues a warning that he will kill Mowgli {{at the end of the}} drought. After the drought ends, the wolves debate whether they should keep Mowgli or not. Mowgli decides to leave the jungle for the safety of <b>his</b> <b>pack.</b> Bagheera agrees with the decision and volunteers to guide him to the nearby man village.|$|E

25|$|Mullan left Baltimore on March 31, and New York City on April 5. Traveling by steamers {{and again}} {{crossing}} the Isthmus of Panama, he reached Fort Dalles on May 15, 1859. He now hired more than 80 civilians as his road construction crew, {{including his own}} brothers Louis (a drover) and Charles (a physician), and his future brother-in-law, David Williamson. The crew included carpenters, cooks, herders, laborers, teamsters, and topographers. The Army provided an escort {{under the command of}} Lt. James White. White's troop consisted of 100 soldiers and 40 packers and teamsters. Mullan also acquired 180 oxen and dozens of cattle, horses, and mules, and hired famed wagon master John Creighton to organize <b>his</b> <b>pack</b> train. To scout the route ahead, Mullan relied on Kolecki, Sohon, and Engle, as well as a new topographer, Walter W. DeLacy.|$|E
25|$|Montgomerie {{found himself}} {{with a large number}} of seriously wounded men which he could neither leave behind if he {{advanced}} or retreated. He also lost many of <b>his</b> <b>pack</b> animals so {{that it was impossible to}} proceed any farther. He had to abandon the advance along with a large quantity of supplies in order to provide pack horses to transport the wounded to safety. The British force retreated back to Fort Prince George. Montgomerie turned over supplies to the fort and left his most badly wounded. He then continued his withdrawal to Charleston. While his expedition was partially successful in destroying the Cherokee Lower Towns and relieving Fort Prince George, he had been halted and forced to withdraw at the Middle Towns and failed to relieve Fort Loudoun. By August he and his men sailed back to New York.|$|E
25|$|The Grenadier and the Light {{infantry}} companies {{moved forward}} {{to support the}} Rangers while the Royal Scots came forward on rising ground {{to the right of}} the Cherokee. The Royal Scots were thrown back into open ground by heavy rifle fire and it took some time to reform and fight off the Cherokee counter-attack. Montgomerie now extended his line on the left with the Highlanders, who turned the Indian right. The Indians retired from this advance and came into contact with the Royal Scots in a brisk encounter from which they retreated to a position on a hill from which they could not be dislodged. Montgomerie ordered an advance through the pass and on to the town, but some of the Cherokee ran to warn the inhabitants to leave. Some of the warriors had got around his flanks and attacked <b>his</b> <b>pack</b> animals and supply train whose loss would cripple the army. This attack was eventually driven off.|$|E

Hermey, oinking like a pig, lures the monster out of his cave and Yukon drops rocks on his head to knock him out. Hermey then pulls out all the monster's teeth. Realizing that the Abominable is now defenseless, Yukon drives the toothless monster back, only to fall over the cliff with all <b>his</b> <b>pack</b> dogs. Mourning Yukon's death, Rudolph, Hermey, Clarice, and the Donners return home where everyone apologizes to them.

The team then flies off to the island where the Misfit Toys to pick them up. The special ends with Santa wishing the viewers a merry Christmas as he and Rudolph fly off into the night.|$|E
500|$|OR-7, {{also known}} as Journey, is a male gray wolf that was {{electronically}} tracked as he migrated from the Wallowa Mountains in northeastern corner of the U.S. state of Oregon to the southern Cascade Range.
