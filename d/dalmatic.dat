5|$|Headed by Saint Peter, the Apostles {{are dressed}} in white robes and sit on two facing benches set below Christ {{and to the right}} and left of the choir of virgins. Two angels attend to the groups {{gathered}} at each side of the benches. A further two angels are positioned immediately above Christ. They hold his cross and {{are dressed in}} white amice and albs, with the right hand angel wearing an outer blue <b>dalmatic</b> vestment. They are flanked on either side by angels playing long wind instruments, probably trumpets. The two angels on either side of Christ bear the symbols of the crucifixion already represented on the left hand panel. The angel on the left holds a lance and crown of thorns, the angel on the right a sponge and nails.|$|E
5|$|In 1161, Edward the Confessor {{was made}} a saint, and objects {{connected}} with his reign became holy relics. The monks at his burial place of Westminster Abbey claimed that Edward had asked them to look after his regalia in perpetuity {{and that they were}} to be used at the coronations of all future kings. A note to this effect is contained in an inventory of relics drawn up by Richard Sporley, a monk at the abbey in 1450, recording a tunicle, <b>dalmatic,</b> pallium, and other vestments; a gold sceptre, two rods, a gold crown, comb, and spoon; for the queen's coronation a crown and two rods; and for the holy communion a chalice of onyx stone and a paten made of gold– all of which were to be considered precious relics. Although the claim is likely to have been an exercise in self-promotion on the abbey's part, and some of the regalia had probably been taken from Edward's grave when he was reinterred there, it became accepted as fact, thereby establishing the first known set of hereditary coronation regalia in Europe.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{military}} {{dress was}} shown in Western art into the Baroque period and beyond (see Reni picture above), {{and up to the}} present day in Eastern Orthodox icons. Other angels came to be conventionally depicted in long robes, and in the later Middle Ages they often wear the vestments of a deacon, a cope over a <b>dalmatic.</b> This costume was used especially for Gabriel in Annunciation scenes—for example the Annunciation in Washington by Jan van Eyck.|$|E

25|$|The two St Johns stand {{either side}} of the throne. On the left is John the Baptist {{pointing}} at the Christ Child and holding a staff, with his lamb beside him; John the Evangelist, holding the poisoned chalice, is on the right. An angel dressed in a costly gold brocade <b>dalmatic,</b> plays a portable organ in front of John the Baptist; another angel, wearing a simple alb and holding the Book of Wisdom for the Virgin, is in front of John the Evangelist. The cloistered space is enclosed with pillars with representations from the lives of the two Johns. The capitals on the pillars above John the Baptist show the vision of his father Zachariah and the Baptist's Nativity; above the Evangelist are the Drinking of the Cup by the Priest of Diana and the Resurrection of Drusiana.|$|E
25|$|A 14th-century mosaic (right) {{from the}} Kahriye-Cami or Chora Church in Istanbul gives an {{excellent}} {{view of a}} range of costume from the late period. From the left, there is a soldier on guard, the governor in one of the large hats worn by important officials, a middle-ranking civil servant (holding the register roll) in a <b>dalmatic</b> with a wide border, probably embroidered, over a long tunic, which also has a border. Then comes a higher-ranking soldier, carrying a sword on an untied belt or baldric. The Virgin and St Joseph are in their normal iconographic dress, and behind St Joseph a queue of respectable citizens wait their turn to register. Male hem lengths drop as the status of the person increases. All the exposed legs have hose, and the soldiers and citizens have foot-wrappings above, presumably with sandals. The citizens wear dalmatics with a wide border around the neck and hem, but not as rich as that of the middle-level official. The other men would perhaps wear hats if not {{in the presence of the}} governor. A donor figure in the same church, the Grand Logothete Theodore Metochites, who ran the legal system and finances of the Empire, wears an even larger hat, which he keeps on whilst kneeling before Christ (see Gallery).|$|E
500|$|Robes {{include the}} Supertunica, a <b>dalmatic</b> made for GeorgeV in 1911; and the Imperial Mantle, a pallium made for GeorgeIV in 1821.

The stole is adorned with emblems of Australia, Canada, Ceylon, India, New Zealand, and the four countries of the United Kingdom –members of the Commonwealth, which is headed by the Queen. All the robes have priestly connotations and their form has changed little since medieval times.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{promoted}} by the worldwide Guns, God and Government Tour, which began in North America in 3–6,000-capacity venues on October 27, 2000 at the Orpheum Theatre in Minneapolis. Typically for the band, the concerts were highly theatrical. The tour's imagery was mainly derived from the concept and themes found on the album; its logo was a rifle, with handguns arranged to resemble the Christian cross. Sets were designed with communist, religious and [...] "celebritarian" [...] imagery. Manson {{had a number of}} costume changes during each show: a bishop's <b>dalmatic</b> and mitre (often confused with papal regalia); a costume made from animals (including epaulettes made from a horse's tail and a shirt made from skinned goat heads and ostrich spines); his signature black leather corset, g-string and garter stockings; an elaborate Roman legionary-style imperial galea; an Allgemeine SS-style peaked police cap; a black-and-white fur coat, and a large conical skirt which lifted him [...] in the air.|$|E
2500|$|The Imperial Regalia of the Holy Roman Emperors, {{kept in the}} Schatzkammer (Vienna), {{contains}} {{a full set of}} outer garments made in the 12th century in essentially Byzantine style at the Byzantine-founded workshops in Palermo. These are among the best surviving Byzantine garments and give a good idea of the lavishness of Imperial ceremonial clothing. There is a cloak (worn by the Emperors with the gap at the front), [...] "alb", <b>dalmatic,</b> stockings, slippers and gloves. The loros is Italian and later. Each element of the design on the cloak (see Textiles below) is outlined in pearls and embroidered in gold.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the outer}} tiers of niches {{we see some}} of the prophets: Jeremiah, Joel, Zechariah and Malachi, with all but Zechariah {{carrying}} his name, are in the outer tier on the left hand side and Daniel, Amos, Isaiah and Ezekiel feature in the outer tier on the right hand side. Then in the inner tiers we have the Saints and Martyrs of the Christian Church. We have on one side, Edmund, the Christian King of the East Angles, defeated by the Vikings; Cecilia, patron of music and virgin martyr; [...] George, soldier and martyr; and Vincent of Spain with his gridiron {{and on the other side}} Catherine of Alexandria with her wheel; Polycarp; Lawrence; and Alban the Roman soldier who was the first British martyr. Polycarp wears the full Eucharistic robes of a Bishop- chasuble, <b>dalmatic</b> and tunicle.|$|E
50|$|Matthew was {{a witness}} to {{charters}} of kings Robert II and Robert III, an occasional ambassador of the Scottish crown to England, and a frequent arbiter in disputes concerning various religious establishments. On 21 May 1401, he introduced a tax in his diocese to improve the deficient ornamenta of the diocese (i.e. chasubles, copes, <b>dalmatics,</b> etc.). According to the Martyrology of Glasgow, he died on 10 May 1408.|$|R
50|$|The clergy of the 11th {{century had}} shaved heads and wore bonnets, which, {{according}} to Planché, were “slightly sinking in the centre, with the pendent ornaments of the mitre {{attached to the}} side of it”. Other garments included the chasuble, the outermost liturgical vestment, which retained its shape, and the <b>dalmatics,</b> a tunic like vestment with large, bell shaped sleeves, which tended to be arched on the sides. The pastoral staff was generally found to be plain in colour and ornamentation.|$|R
50|$|The apse's {{dimensions}} are 325 x 315 x 320 cm, and it contains several images although {{the most prominent}} one is a fragmentary image of the Wise and Foolish Virgins parable found in Matthew 25:1-13. Three of the five Wise Virgins' heads have been removed due to historic construction on the church building; however, all figures seem to be wearing similar embroidered <b>dalmatics</b> and tunics with close-fitting sleeves that are worn below the open-fitted sleeves of the <b>dalmatics.</b> The Virgins are crowned with bridal crowns resting on caps and are seen wearing spiral earrings. The crowns resemble those found in Rome during the sixth century. Originally, all five Wise Virgins were depicted seated at the marriage supper with burning cressets in their left hands. The Bridegroom figure (Christ) is all but gone however his hand can be seen extending over the table. On {{the other side of}} the scene are the five Foolish Virgins. The Foolish Virgins are not clothed in the intricate <b>dalmatics</b> as the Wise Virgins, and they do not wear crowns. Instead, they don coifs that are arranged in folds over their hair. Also unlike the Wise Virgins, the five Foolish Virgins hold their cressets inverted with oil vessels hanging from them. Beneath the virgins is a pattern described as “medallions of beasts.” A young figure is also pictured sitting upon a church with the head encircled by a nimbus (halo). There is a discrepancy as to whether the figure is male or female, and to the object that is held in the figure’s hand. Suggestions have been wand, lily or palm. What can be agreed upon is that this image is a personification of the church. Trace figures of the Archangel Gabriel and the Virgin Mary were once reported, but have since faded entirely although the inscription SCA (Sancta) MARIA was recorded. An image of the Theotokos holding the infant Jesus was also present but was covered with mortar during repairs. There is a fret pattern below the illustrated figures along with simulated drapery present. The apse's window is also decorated with a geometric pattern.|$|R
2500|$|On Good Friday, {{elements}} that suggested the usual {{practices of the}} Mass were removed: the sacred ministers began the liturgy in alb and (for celebrant and deacon) black stoles, rather than respectively in black chasuble, <b>dalmatic,</b> and tunicle, as per a typical Mass; the sacred ministers donned their vestments (without maniples) only for the Solemn Intercessions, in which the celebrant wore a cope instead of a chasuble, and removed them for the adoration of the Cross; the sacred ministers changed to violet vestments (again, without maniples) for the distribution of Holy Communion; [...] "Let us pray. Let us kneel. Arise" [...] was added at the prayer for the Jews, and the adjective perfidis was removed (see Good Friday Prayer for the Jews); an afternoon Communion Service replaced the morning Mass of the Presanctified, at which the priest alone received the earlier-consecrated host, and drank unconsecrated wine into which {{a small portion of}} the consecrated host had been put.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} stages of the Byzantine Empire the {{traditional}} Roman toga was still used as very formal or official dress. [...] By Justinian's time this had been replaced by the tunica, or long chiton, for both sexes, over which the upper classes wore other garments, like a dalmatica (<b>dalmatic),</b> a heavier and shorter type of tunica, again worn by both sexes, but mainly by men. The hems often curve down to a sharp point. The scaramangion was a riding-coat of Persian origin, opening down the front and normally coming to the mid-thigh, although these are recorded as being worn by Emperors, when they seem to become much longer. In general, except for military and presumably riding-dress, men of higher status, and all women, had clothes that came down to the ankles, or nearly so. Women often wore a top layer of the stola, for the rich in brocade. All of these, except the stola, might be belted or not. The terms for dress are often confusing, and certain identification of the name a particular pictured item had, or the design that relates to a particular documentary reference, is rare, especially outside the Court.|$|E
2500|$|Another of van Eyck's themes, {{and that}} of other Early Netherlandish painters, is {{indicated}} by the large cope over a <b>dalmatic</b> worn by Gabriel. [...] This would, in a human, mark him as a celebrant or attendant at a High Mass. [...] Mary is facing {{a table with a}} book upon it about the right size to be a Gospel Book or Missal, and has her hands raised in a gesture known as the expansis manibus. [...] This is certainly to convey the alarm and uncertainty with which she usually greets the surprising apparition of Gabriel and his news, but is also a gesture used by a priest at certain points of a Mass. [...] The painting has been connected with the Golden Mass ("Missa Aurea"), a liturgical drama, or dramatised Mass, popular in the Netherlands at the time, which included a staging of the Annunciation as the Gospel reading. [...] More generally, {{this is part of a}} common theme in Early Netherlandish art where Mary, as intermediary between the faithful and God, is compared to, or seen as, a priest celebrating Mass. [...] Her personal sacrifice of her son [...] is compared to the ritual sacrifice enacted by the priest in the Mass. [...] In a surviving extreme example in the Louvre she is shown clearly wearing vestments and celebrating mass at an altar; more often, as here, the comparison is made more subtly.|$|E
50|$|During {{his time}} as Master of Ceremonies Pope Benedict ceased to use the papal staff made for Paul VI, and began to use an older one made for Pius XI (pictured). Due to the weight of that staff, Benedict had his own made which is much lighter, and shares a similar style with the {{previous}} one (Pope Francis occasionally makes use of this one also in order to emphasize continuity with his predecessor). He also made decisions {{about the use of}} papal vestments at Mass and other pontifical celebrations, dressing Cardinal-Deacons in <b>dalmatics</b> when serving pontifical celebrations.|$|R
50|$|The various {{artefacts}} {{that survived}} from the Reformation, {{as well as}} from other defunct Haarlem catholic collections, have thus found their way into the collection and are now in the schatkamer, such as a 17th-century painting of the patron saint Bavo and silver from the chapel of Louis Napoleon, who resided {{for more than a decade}} at Villa Welgelegen. There are old chasubles, <b>dalmatics,</b> and surplices of the Haarlem clergy, richly embroidered, and showing popular Catholic themes. The French ones are probably also from the Louis Napoleon period, but the earliest are Flemish in origin and date back to the early 16th century.|$|R
50|$|In the Anglo-Catholic {{tradition}} of Anglicanism, the term Pontifical High Mass may {{refer to a}} Mass celebrated with the traditional Tridentine ceremonies described above. Liturgical manuals such as Ritual Notes {{provide a framework for}} incorporating Tridentine ceremonial into the services of the Book of Common Prayer. More generally, the term may refer to any High Mass celebrated by a bishop, usually in the presence of his or her throne. The Pontifical High Mass is one of four full-form pontifical functions, the other three being pontifical Evensong, High Mass {{in the presence of a}} greater prelate, and Solemn Evensong in the presence of a greater prelate. In its more traditional form, the ministers required at the service are a deacon and subdeacon of the Mass, assistant deacons in <b>dalmatics,</b> and an assistant priest in cope and surplice, who acts as the episcopal chaplain, along with the usual servers.|$|R
2500|$|Choir {{dress in}} Anglicanism {{traditionally}} consists of cassock, surplice and scarf (or tippet). An academic hood {{may also be}} worn and, since 1964 in the Church of England a cope may be worn {{at the discretion of}} the minister. [...] However, the basic garment was, and is, the surplice which by the fourteenth century had become the essential choir-vestment everywhere. The surplice was the only vesture permitted to the clergy in the 1552 Prayer Book, except for bishops who should use a rochet (both wore cassocks as the standard undergarment). The Elizabethan Prayer Book of 1559 included the so-called Ornaments Rubric. [...] Its legal interpretation was disputed in the nineteenth century it was claimed that its inclusion in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer commanded the pre-Reformation Eucharistic vestments (chasuble, <b>dalmatic,</b> tunicle, alb, amice, and maniple) that had been in use during the reign of Edward VI. [...] However, the Elizabethan bishops struggled to enforce the use of the surplice, and the use of Eucharistic vestments was discontinued until after the Oxford Movement, {{in the middle of the}} nineteenth century, when it was restored in many cathedrals and parish churches. In many low-church dioceses and parishes the choir dress continued to be the norm, even at the Eucharist. The cope nevertheless continued in use for coronations and in certain cathedrals, but this may be considered an extension of [...] "choir dress" [...] and was sanctioned by the canons of 1603/4.|$|E
2500|$|In the sacristy, before vesting, {{all three}} sacred ministers (priest celebrant, deacon, and subdeacon) wash their hands. The sacred ministers recite certain prayers while they place on each vestment. First, the amice (a {{rectangular}} cloth of linen with long strings for tying) is kissed (if it is embroidered with a cross) and then placed {{on top of}} the head briefly while reciting one of the prayers during vesting. Then it is tied around the shoulders {{on top of the}} cassock (or on top of the habit, if the sacred ministers belongs to a religious order with one). Next the alb (a long linen tunic with sleeves) is put on. The cincture (in Latin, cinctura), a long cloth cord also called a girdle, is then tied around the waist. The subdeacon then completes his vesting by placing the maniple (an embroidered piece of fabric, folded in half, with a cross in the middle) on his left arm (provided there is no Asperges or other liturgical ceremony before Mass begins), securing it either with pins or with the ribbons or elastic inside, and then the tunicle (an embroidered tunic with short sleeves) over all. The deacon places his stole (a long narrow embroidered piece of cloth, similar to the maniple but of greater length) over his left shoulder and binds it in place, at his right hip, with the cincture or girdle. He then puts on the maniple and his <b>dalmatic</b> (similar to the tunicle). The priest celebrant does the same except that he crosses his stole in front of him at the waist, binding it with the girdle or cincture. After the maniple he puts on a cope (a long, heavy embroidered cape) if the Mass is preceded by the Asperges (sprinkling the congregation with holy water). [...] Following the Asperges, the celebrant, assisted by the acolytes, removes the cope and puts on the chasuble (similar to the tunicle, but without sleeves and usually with an embroidered cross or image on the back).|$|E
2500|$|Published in 2006, Evangelical Lutheran Worship is {{the main}} hymnal used in congregations. Some congregations, however, {{continue}} to use the older Lutheran Book of Worship published by the Inter-Lutheran Commission on Worship in 1978, and some even continue to use the older Service Book and Hymnal (SBH) of 1958 or its antecedent precedent-setting Common Service of 1888 which laid out a traditional American Lutheran liturgy and later was included in subsequent worship books and hymnals of various churches especially The Common Service Book of 1917, adopted by the old United Lutheran Church in America, a predecessor of the LCA to 1962, and The Lutheran Hymnal (TLH-1941) of the LCMS. Many congregations also make use of supplementary resources recently published as well besides those authorized for the LBW by Augsburg-Fortress, Publishers. Many ELCA congregations are classically liturgical churches. Their liturgy {{is rooted in the}} Western liturgical tradition, though recent international Lutheran-Orthodox dialog sessions have had some minimal influence on Lutheran liturgy. Because of its use of the Book of Concord of 1580, with the Confessions, documents and beliefs of the Reformers, including the Augsburg Confession of 1530, Luther's Small Catechism of 1529 and the Large Catechism and its retention of many pre-Reformation traditions, such as vestments, feast days and the celebration of the Church Year, the sign of the cross, and the usage of a church-wide liturgy, there are many aspects of the typical ELCA church that are very catholic and traditional in nature. Many Evangelical Lutheran churches use traditional vestments (cassock, surplice, stole for services of the Word or non-Eucharistic liturgies or alb, cincture, stole, chasuble (pastor) or <b>dalmatic</b> (deacon), cope (processions) for Eucharists (Mass, Holy Communion), etc.). On special rare occasions even a bishop's cross/crozier and mitre (bishop's headpiece) have been used to designate the ancient robes and traditions of the Church originating in Roman times of which Luther and his fellow Reformers like Phillip Melancthon considered as [...] "adiaphora" [...] or of permissive use. Since the Second Vatican Council of the 1960s, most major parts of the ELCA's popular liturgies are worded exactly like the English language Mass of 1970 of the Roman Catholic Church. Many ELCA congregations use informal styles of worship or a blend of traditional and contemporary liturgical forms.|$|E

40|$|This article {{illustrates}} {{and describes}} in detail a fine central European chasuble {{of the late}} c 17 which, together with two <b>dalmatics,</b> ‘The Fetternear Vestments,’ were bequeathed to the Diocese of Aberdeen, in 1921 by the Leslie family, {{many of whom had}} been distinguished soldiers on the continent and especially in the Empire. After some contextual discussion of the alleged origins of the Leslie family and of their success in Imperial service, the article examines the traditional belief that the vestments, now at the Blairs Museum, Aberdeen, were made for Count James Leslie (c. 1621 - 1694) partly out of Turkish textiles captured in 1683 at the Siege of Vienna. Detailed analysis of the embroidery on the chasuble, especially of the use of metal thread and ‘plate,’ demonstrates that the gold work is indeed of Turkish origin, the rest of the needle work central European, and thus makes the case that this extraordinary hybrid object is indeed a votive vestment made for the Catholic Leslies partly from captured Turkish work...|$|R
500|$|After Parliament was dismissed, Elizabeth and Cecil {{drafted the}} Royal Injunctions. These were {{additions}} to the settlement, and largely stressed continuity with the Catholic past – clergy were ordered to wear the surplice {{and the use of}} the cope was allowed in cathedrals and collegiate chapels. The Ornaments Rubric states that the ornaments of the church and ministers thereof shall remain as they were in the second year of the reign of Edward VI, i.e. in 1548, when Mass was still celebrated (the Oxford Movement in the 19th century interpreted this as permission to wear chasubles, <b>dalmatics</b> and other vestments). Wafers, as opposed to ordinary baker's bread, were to be used as the bread at Communion. There had been opposition to the settlement in rural England, which for the most part was largely Roman Catholic, so the changes aimed for acceptance of the settlement. What succeeded more than anything else was the sheer length of Elizabeth's reign; while Mary had been able to impose her programme for a mere five years, Elizabeth had more than forty. Those who delayed, [...] "looking for a new day" [...] when restoration would again be commanded, were defeated by the passing of years.|$|R

He had been wearing a tunicle and <b>dalmatic</b> under a chasuble, a pectoral cross, purple gloves, sandals and buskins, a mitre and his presentation ring. In his hand he had borne his pastoral staff. And the clustering pillars and arches of the great doorway were painted with a loving flat particularity that omitted nothing but the sooty tinge of the later discolourations.|$|E
5000|$|The rubric first {{appears in}} the Elizabethan {{revision}} of the BCP in 1559 and was retained in the later 1604 revision under James I. The second paragraph is essentially an extract from penultimate section of the Elizabethan Act of Uniformity (1559 - 1 Elizabeth I,c.2) and breaks off {{in the middle of}} a sentence. The act itself provided that: [...] "... such ornaments of the Church and of the ministers thereof shall be retained and be in use as were in this Church of England by the authority of Parliament in the Second Year of the Reign of King Edward the Sixth shall be retained and be in use, until other order shall be therein taken by the Queen's Majesty with the advice of her commissioners appointed and authorized under the great Seal of England for ecclesiastical causes, or of the metropolitan of this realm; ..." [...] Until June 1549 the Sarum Rite Mass (a version of the Roman Rite) was celebrated in Latin, with certain insertions in English.

The Litany of Our Lady, though usually printed after the [...] "O Salutaris" [...] and very generally sung at Benediction, is not obligatory. Further solemnity is often given to the service by the presence of deacon and subdeacon in <b>dalmatics.</b> When the bishop of the diocese officiates he uses mitre and crosier in the procession to the altar, and makes {{the sign of the cross}} over the people three times in giving the benediction. Otherwise, when the means for carrying out a more elaborate rite are not available, an informal service is permitted. The priest, wearing cotta and stole, simply opens the tabernacle door. Prayers and devotions are said or sung, and then the priest blesses those present with the veiled ciborium before the tabernacle door is again closed. The permission, general or special, of the bishop of the diocese is necessary for services where Benediction is given with the monstrance.|$|R
