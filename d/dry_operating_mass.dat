40|$|The {{present study}} was aimed to {{optimize}} the spray <b>drying</b> <b>operating</b> parameters {{for the production of}} quality pomegranate juice powder using response surface methodology. The spray <b>drying</b> <b>operating</b> conditions including inlet air temperature (170 – 190 °C), feed flow rate (18 – 30  mL/min), and blower speed varied (2, 000 – 2, 400  rpm) were used as independent variables. The responses evaluated were ascorbic acid content, anthocyanin content, moisture content, hygroscopicity, and water solubility index. Statistical analysis showed that among the independent variables, inlet air temperature showed greater effect on all the investigated responses. The derived optimum conditions were used for the powder production to check the validity of the quadratic model. Small deviations were observed between the experimental values and the predicted ones and the values were within the acceptable limits. The results showed that the optimum spray <b>drying</b> <b>operating</b> conditions for the production of pomegranate juice powder with optimum quality were 171 °C inlet temperature, 30  mL/min feed flow rate, and 2, 400  rpm blower speed. Under these optimum conditions, quality pomegranate juice powder with desirable properties of high content of vitamin C and anthocyanin, low moisture content, low hygroscopicity, and high solubility could be produced...|$|R

40|$|Resorcinol-formaldehyde hydrogels {{prepared}} {{at various}} resorcinol/sodium carbonate ratios, R/C, were convectively air dried. The {{influence of the}} <b>drying</b> <b>operating</b> conditions, i. e. air temperature and velocity, on the pore texture, shrinkage and cracking of the dried gels were investigated. Shrinkage {{was found to be}} isotropic. The shrinkage behaviour and the textural properties of the gels are independent of the <b>drying</b> <b>operating</b> conditions, but are completely determined by the value of the synthesis variables. The analysis of the drying kinetics shows two main drying periods. During the first phase, shrinkage occurs and the external surface of the material remains completely wet: heat and mass transfers are limited by external resistances located in a boundary layer. When shrinkage stops, the second period begins: the evaporation front recedes inside the solid and internal transfer limitations prevail. The drying time can be reduced by increasing the air temperature and/or velocity, but the temperature increase is limited when monolithicity is required, especially when the pores are small. For example, at a temperature of 160 degrees C and a velocity of 2 m/s, about 1 h is needed to dry a 2. 8 cm in diameter and 1 cm in height cylinder containing macropores (pore width > 50 nm after drying). The same cylinder presenting small mesopores (pore width = 10 - 15 nm after drying) requires 20 h at 30 degrees C and 2 m/s to reach complete dryness without the development of cracks.

A small-scale prototype of a flat tank paper drier was built and tested in a variety of conditions and with a variety of handmade paper types. The tests showed consistent performance, with a specific energy consumption of about 3. 5 MJ per kg of water evaporated from the paper. This corresponds to a drier efficiency of up to 80 %, with reference to the latent heat of evaporation. Drier temperature variations were minimal, and the performance was considered satisfactory to continue with further development of the drier for local handmade paper production facilities. Measured drying rates compared well with predicted values calculated using correlations based on Stefan's law...|$|R
