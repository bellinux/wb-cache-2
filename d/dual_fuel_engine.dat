Due to natural gas’ cleaner burning properties, the use of natural gas in merchant ship propulsion plants is becoming an option for companies in order to comply with IMO and MARPOL environmental regulations.

LNG carriers are heavily insulated to keep the LNG at around -160 °C - to keep it liquefied. What happens is that even with all the insulation, the LNG containment area is penetrated by heat which allows for naturally generated boil-off gas (BOG).|$|E

A new quasi-dimensional, multi-zone model has been developed to describe the combustion processes occurring inside a <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>engine.</b> A <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>engine</b> is a compression ignition engine in which a homogeneous lean premixed charge of gaseous fuel and air is ignited by a pilot fuel spray.

The chemical kinetics, reaction rates and their equations lead to a certain formula for which the coefficients can be obtained from different sources, such as NASA polynomials [1]. This is followed by study of the simulation results and significant findings. Finally, for investigation of the knock phenomenon some characteristics such as compression ratio, fuel equivalence ratio, spark timing and their effects on the performance of an engine are examined and discussed. The OH radical concentration (which is the main factor for production of knock) is evaluated with regard to adjustment of the above mentioned characteristic parameters. In the second part of this work the specification of the sample engine is given and the results obtained from simulation are compared with experimental results for this sample engine, in order to validate the method applied in AVL Fire software.

50|$|The {{natural gas}} that <b>fuels</b> <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>engines</b> {{is carried on}} ships as a boiling liquid, and transported at {{slightly}} higher than atmospheric pressure. When tank insulation is penetrated by any influx in heat, it will cause {{the temperature of the}} liquefied natural gas to rise, which allows for vaporization from liquid to gas. When heat penetrates the tank, the tank’s pressure increases due to boil-off. The insulation of the tanks is designed with the most advanced technology. Even still, the insulation of the tanks is penetrated by heat. The boil-off occurs during the ships voyage. During a storm, the LNG cargo moves and sloshes around in the tanks. The boil-off gas represents 0.1% - 0.25% of the ships capacity per day. Tanks need to be maintained at a steady pressure. If the pressure in tanks is not controlled relief or safety valves are forced to open, venting the boil-off into the atmosphere until pressure is relieved. At this point, it has been proven that on board LNG re-liquefaction is uneconomical for most ships. Instead, the gas produced by this boil-off effect is routed to the ship’s propulsion system and used as fuel for power plants such as steam boilers and <b>dual</b> <b>fuel</b> marine diesel <b>engines.</b> This reduces the use of bunker fuel, reducing fuel costs and equipment maintenance costs.|$|R
