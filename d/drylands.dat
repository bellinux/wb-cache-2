Methods We studied 15 winter wheat genotypes (12 from north China and 3 from Texas, USA) on the Loess Plateau of East Gansu under <b>dryland</b> and supplemental irrigation treatments at the jointing stage. Important findings Different genotypes had considerable differences in grain yield, WUE and δ 13 C value whether under <b>dryland</b> or irrigation, and the δ 13 C value increased with grain filling proceeding. Moreover, the δ 13 C value under <b>dryland</b> condition was higher than under limited irrigation. The correlation between δ 13 C with grain yield and WUE is significant during the grain filling stages whether under <b>dryland</b> or irrigation, and the correlation under <b>dryland</b> is better than that under limited irrigation. With irrigation of 100 mm water at jointing stage, various genotypes of winter wheat had significant compensation or super compensation effects.
