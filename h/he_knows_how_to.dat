25|$|Lively {{tries to}} {{drive a wedge between}} Kenehan and the miners by convincing a young widow, Bridey Mae Tolliver, to falsely accuse Kenehan of sexual assault, and he plants a letter which makes Kenehan appear to be the infiltrator. Danny Radnor overhears Hickey and Griggs talking about the scheme but is caught and held by the two men. The agents intend to keep a watchful eye on Danny, but become drunk and are not paying {{attention}} that night when Danny, while preaching at the Freewill church, relates a parable about Joseph that convinces the miners that they have been deceived by a false story. One of the miners hurries to the camp to find Few Clothes (James Earl Jones), who had drawn the short straw for who would kill Kenehan for his assumed treachery. Few Clothes tells Kenehan he is there to guard him when he comments on the gun the black miner has. Asked whether <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> use it, Few Clothes says yes, {{that he was in the}} Spanish–American War of 1898. Kenehan tells him that he was in Fort Leavenworth Military Penitentiary in 1917, and saw Mennonites imprisoned for refusing to bear arms passively resist having their beards shaved and rip the buttons off their prison clothes, since all these were against their religion. They were punished by being handcuffed to cell bars for eight hours per day, until the cuffs had cut into their wrists and caused gangrene. Despite it all, they ripped off re-sewn buttons with their teeth, not one giving up. Kenehan says he never saw braver men, and ironically they were in there for refusing to fight. This tale of bravery and injustice leaves Few Clothes conflicted and unsure about his mission to execute Kenehan. Another miner arrives and tells Few Clothes the truth and Kenehan's execution is called off just in time. Meanwhile, Sephus has made his way back to town and informed the others of Lively's betrayal, furiously burning down his restaurant. Lively flees town by swimming across the Tug Fork River.|$|E

Rhys is ambitious, persuasive and manipulative. His profile on the official Neighbours website states that he believes Erinsborough is [...] "a bit of a backwater", while he {{is more of a}} city guy. Rhys is an enthusiastic young doctor and often riles his colleague, Karl, in his quest to become a surgeon. He wants to succeed and can justify why he does certain things, which hurt other people. Rhys is good at separating his work life from his home life and <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> have a good time. Barber revealed that Rhys does have a sensitive side and he can mean well.|$|E

Chappelle called the episode [...] "intriguing because it's a summation of everything that came before it, so we're resolving {{a lot of issues}} and a lot of questions. But it's also a springboard into the rest of the season". Actor John Noble, who played Walter Bishop, called it [...] "probably one of our strongest and densest episodes" [...] because it [...] "changes the whole direction of the show".|$|E

Lin gained national attention for his performance against the 12th-ranked Connecticut Huskies, against whom he scored a career-high 30 points and grabbed 9 rebounds on the road.

500|$|Earlier, in January 1913, the Flood Sufferers {{pulled out}} from the 12-team Central League and joined the newly formed Interstate League, which {{included}} eight clubs. [...] According to Sporting Life, the new league was expected to include teams from Akron, Youngstown, Canton, Steubenville, Wheeling, and either Johnstown or McKeesport. [...] In February, the paper confirmed that the Interstate League (which included Johnstown, not McKeesport) had achieved Class B status {{on the basis of}} the eight cities' combined populations. [...] Sporting Life, which estimated the total population of the league's participating cities at 412,415, noted that Youngstown (with a population of 79,066) was the largest city in the Interstate League. [...] Later that month, the paper reported that the new league's [...] "salary limit of $2000 makes it imperative for each club to hold down expenses in every way; consequently Marty Hogan, of the Zanesville Club, will be the only bench manager in the league, and <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> save his salary in various ways".|$|E
500|$|Alison Rowat of The Herald {{perceived}} Doomsday as [...] "decidedly everyday" [...] for a thriller, with Marshall's script {{having too}} many unanswered questions and characters not fully developed despite a decent cast. Rowat said, [...] "In his previous films, Marshall made {{something out of}} nothing. Here he does the opposite". The critic acknowledged the attempted homages and the B-movie approach but thought that [...] "there {{has to be something}} more". Steve Pratt of The Northern Echo weighed in, [...] "As a writer, Marshall leaves gaping holes in the plot while as a director <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> extract maximum punch from car chases, beatings and fights without stinting on the gore as body parts are lopped off with alarming frequency and bodies squashed to a bloody pulp." [...] Philip Key of the Liverpool Daily Post described the film, [...] "Doomsday is a badly thought-out science fiction saga which leaves more questions than answers." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Shivers" [...] {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} {{and became a}} major underground success in Australia, bringing more national attention to the band. Nick Cave cited it in hindsight as {{the main reason for}} the Boys Next Door's eminence. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic Will Lerner wrote that [...] "it's impressive how, even at this early stage, Nick Cave was a confident and unique singer, perfectly aware of the strengths and limitations of his voice … <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> come across in a scary and theatrical manner that perfectly complements the music. Nowhere is this more apparent than on … 'Shivers', an unashamedly melodramatic example of post-adolescent anguish". [...] "Shivers", along with other songs Howard composed, were [...] "crucial to guiding the band in the darker, wilder direction" [...] that defined the Birthday Party's music, according to Dan Lawrence of Stereogum. The song has since been considered an Australian classic and labelled by ABC Television as [...] "possibly Australia's most enduring cult hit".|$|E
500|$|Rhys has a {{one-night stand}} with Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) not long after his introduction. Rhys meets Kate in the local bar {{and they have a}} [...] "big night out"; the {{following}} morning Kate wakes up in Rhys' apartment. Brewer told a writer for Inside Soap [...] "You don't actually see the lead-up– one minute she meets Rhys in a bar, the next minute we see that they've already slept together!" [...] Kate feels awkward about the situation, but it is made worse when she is unable to remember Rhys' name. When Kate and Rhys meet again, they have different attitudes to their one-night stand. Brewer said Rhys is [...] "a bit of a player", so it is not a big deal to him. He does not have any expectations of Kate, but she is uncomfortable with it and tries to cover her tracks. In November 2011, Brewer said {{it would be interesting to}} revisit the relationship between Rhys and Kate. Barber also thought it would be interesting to see where the characters could go together. The actor added that [...] "sparks fly" [...] when Rhys is around Kate, as <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> [...] "press her buttons".|$|E

The East London BNP activist Eddy Butler noted that at a 1986 party rally in Dewsbury, Tyndall [...] "lost them completely. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> talk to a small room of nationalists, but <b>he</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> talk to a thousand Yorkshire young geezers.

500|$|As their {{relationship}} progresses, Audrey invites Lewis {{to move in}} with her. Nicholls told Suzanne Byrne of RTÉ Ten that Lewis appears to brush Audrey off, before eventually agreeing to move in. Nicholls said, [...] "And then in his usual charming style he brings her breakfast in bed on her birthday, which she adores him for. He's clever like that, <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> bring the balance back to the relationship." [...] In May 2010, the Daily Mirror's Brian Roberts reported that a new plot for Audrey and Lewis could see them leaving Weatherfield for a new life in Greece. The couple go on holiday to a Greek island and Audrey is taken with Lewis' idea of opening a hotel and living a glamorous life out there. Roberts likened the plot development to that of the 1989 film, Shirley Valentine. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury noted that Lewis seemed uncomfortable with the plan; Nicholls said that Audrey is unaware of his doubts. Laws also compared the plot to a similar one in another ITV soap opera, Emmerdale, involving Diane Sugden (Elizabeth Estensen) and Charlie Haynes (George Costigan), and predicted that both storylines would end in heartache. Nicholls wanted Audrey and Lewis to leave together and have a happy ending, and wanted to see a spin-off series focusing on the pair and their new life in Greece. Olivia Buxton from the Daily Mirror questioned whether Lewis would go through with the plan; she wrote that two endings to his story arc had been filmed, one of which showed him making a dramatic exit.|$|E
500|$|What You Were Hoping For? {{received}} {{rave reviews}} from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 90, based on six reviews. AllMusic's Andy Kellman called it [...] "a rare lean, focused album where the in-the-red moments {{are just as}} effective as the twilight ballads", while Jason Heller of The A.V. Club said the record was [...] "twice as raw and thrice as hungry as anything the neo-soul mastermind has previously released ... a full-throated, full-throttle challenge". Writing for WBEZ, Jim DeRogatis called it [...] "as joyful, free-ranging, and wildly inventive a psychedelic-soul classic as any you can name", writing that Hunt's compositions make [...] "even the wildest, most genre-defying flights of fancy ... instantly accessible and equally stimulating to brain and booty." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot dubbed it Hunt's [...] "most adventurous album yet" [...] because he [...] "stretches the parameters of R with a refreshing lack of self-consciousness ... His craftsmanship never devolves into shtick." [...] Kot later named it the fourth-best album of 2011 and wrote that although it is musically varied, [...] "the glue is Hunt's acuity as a songwriter; <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> drop hooks and turn a smart phrase, and this album brims with surprises." [...] Michael Tedder from Paste was slightly more critical, feeling that Hunt [...] "sometimes comes off a bit like he's exploring the idea of a genre more than actually writing a song". He cited drummer Ruth Price as the record's [...] "the secret weapon". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called it [...] "a messy album, sometimes thrillingly so, a mélange of psychedelic rock, punk energy and R desperation".|$|E
2500|$|Harpole {{adds that}} [...] "whereas many {{directors}} disliked rehearsals or advising actors {{on how to}} build their character, Lumet excelled at both." [...] He could thereby more easily give his performers a cinematic showcase for their abilities and help them deepen their acting contribution.

When speaking to MTV News in 2009, Drake called the song's co-producer and rapper Kanye West, [...] "the most influential person on his sound", stating, [...] "Before I ever {{got the chance}} to meet him, Kanye West shaped a lot of what I do, as far as music goes, We always, always, always took the time to listen to Kanye's music and appreciate it beyond. We searched the samples and find out where his inspiration came from, because he has one of the best ears in music, period. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> recognize great music that's not his. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> utilize great sounds and great music.
