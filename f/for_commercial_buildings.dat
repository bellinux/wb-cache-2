Aelony became an advocate for civil rights and social justice beginning in his teen years. [...] From his earliest years he was an admirer of Mahatma Gandhi and non-violent resistance to injustice. At the University of Minnesota, Aelony helped found Students for Integration, a group dedicated to gaining housing and employment for black and minority students. Aelony was arrested several times for testing the ban on segregated interstate travel in the Deep South as a Freedom Rider. He was famously arrested and served time on death row in Americus, Georgia, for attempting to register black voters.|$|E

On eight floors and with 326 bedrooms, the hotel cost over a million dollars and took eight years to build. It was then one of the two most luxurious hotels in the West, second only in size to the Palace Hotel of San Francisco (it stood on what is now Portland’s Pioneer Courthouse Square).|$|E

[...] These were the first examples of commissions for religious buildings which came intermittently throughout the firm's history. [...] From the early 20th century the firm received more and more commissions <b>for</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>buildings,</b> and buildings such as offices and banks characterised the next decades. [...] They designed a [...] "magnificent" [...] furniture depository in Hove for Hannington's department store (completed in 1904), then executed their most celebrated design: a tall, landmark office for the Royal Assurance Society, on a prominent corner site on Brighton's North Street. [...] After making major alterations to their new office in Prince Albert Street, they designed a pub on the main London Road—like many of their buildings, it had a corner turret topped with a dome—in 1905. [...] A year later, they extended the Royal Alexandra Hospital in the Montpelier area of Brighton.|$|E

40|$|Exploring {{changes of}} {{building}} energy consumption and its relationships with climate can provide basis for energy-saving and carbon emission reduction. Heating and cooling energy consumption {{of different types}} of buildings during 1981 - 2010 in Tianjin city, was simulated by using TRNSYS software. Daily or hourly extreme energy consumption was determined by percentile methods, and the climate impact on extreme energy consumption was analyzed. The results showed that days of extreme heating consumption showed apparent decrease during the recent 30 years for residential and large venue buildings, whereas days of extreme cooling consumption increased in large venue building. No significant variations were found for the days of extreme energy consumption <b>for</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>building,</b> although a decreasing trend in extreme heating energy consumption. Daily extreme energy consumption for large venue building had no relationship with climate parameters, whereas extreme energy consumption <b>for</b> <b>commercial</b> and residential <b>buildings</b> was related to various climate parameters. Further multiple regression analysis suggested heating energy consumption <b>for</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>building</b> was affected by maximum temperature, dry bulb temperature, solar radiation and minimum temperature, which together can explain 71. 5 % of the variation of the daily extreme heating energy consumption. The daily extreme cooling energy consumption <b>for</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>building</b> was only related to the wet bulb temperature (R 2 = 0. 382). The daily extreme heating energy consumption for residential building was affected by 4 climate parameters, but the dry bulb temperature had the main impact. The impacts of climate on hourly extreme heating energy consumption has a 1 - 3 hour delay in all three types of buildings, but no delay was found in the impacts of climate on hourly extreme cooling energy consumption for the selected buildings...|$|R
