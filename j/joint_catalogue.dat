In fact, minimum mean rms, erh and erz values (0. 28 secs, 3. 6 km and 5. 8 km, respectively) are found when S-phases are neglected.

Combining optical data (Rc and I_c) obtained with the KPNO/MOSA detector and presented in Stauffer et al. (1999) with the K' observations, a sample of new candidate members has been extracted from the optical-infrared colour-magnitude diagram. The location of these candidates in the colour-colour diagram suggests that two-thirds of them are actually reddened background giants. About 20 new candidate members with masses between 0. 3 and 0. 04 Mȯ {{are added to the}} ~ 400 known α Per cluster members. If they are indeed α Per members, four of the new candidates would be brown dwarfs. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the near-infrared survey as compared to the optical selection method.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of two new hot, hydrogen-rich subdwarfs (sdB) in close binary systems. The hot subdwarfs, GALEX J 0321 + 4727 and GALEX J 2349 + 3844, were selected from a <b>joint</b> optical-ultraviolet <b>catalogue</b> of hot sub-luminous stars based on GSC 2. 3. 2 and the Galaxy Evolution Explorer all-sky survey. Using high-dispersion spectra of the Halpha core obtained using the 2 m telescope at Ondrejov Observatory we measured the radial velocities of the sdB primaries and determined orbital periods of 0. 26584 +/- 0. 00004 days and 0. 46249 +/- 0. 00007 days for GALEX J 0321 + 4727 and GALEX J 2349 + 3844, respectively. The time series obtained from the Northern Sky Variability Survey with an effective wavelength near the R band show that GALEX J 0321 + 4727 is a variable star (Delta m= 0. 12 mag) while no significant variations are observed in GALEX J 2349 + 3844. The period of variations in GALEX J 0321 + 4727 coincides with the orbital period and the variability is probably caused by a reflection effect on a late-type secondary star. Lack of photometric variations in GALEX J 2349 + 3844 probably indicates that the companion is a white dwarf star. Using all available photometry and spectroscopy, we measured the atmospheric properties of the two sdB stars and placed limits on the mass and luminosity of the companion stars.

40|$|Nursing {{and allied}} health {{libraries}} at educational institutions in Norway have generally indexed their book collections with uncontrolled terms. With {{the reorganization of}} higher education in 1994, the majority of these libraries joined BIBSYS, which is a joint library system for higher education and research in Norway. This has led to chaos when searching the <b>joint</b> <b>catalogue</b> for literature on nursing and related fields. A term such as ‘behaviour problems’ may have up to five synonyms. In an attempt {{to improve the quality of}} searching the health literature, BIBSYS appointed a working group in the Spring of 1999 to find a suitable controlled vocabulary for this subject area, and to see how this vocabulary could be integrated into BIBSYS. The group presented its recommendations in October 1999. The report has been well received by the BIBSYS Board and by user groups. There are no Norwegian vocabularies that are suitable for use in nursing and allied health, therefore it will be necessary to translate and combine existing thesauri. The group has looked at the Nordic Multilingual Thesaurus on Health Promotion, the Swedish Spriline Thesaurus, MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) and CINAHL Subject Heading List. Other relevant thesauri are AMED/CATS Thesaurus, Bioethics Thesaurus (Bioethicsline) and the RCN thesaurus.

40|$|The <b>joint</b> <b>catalogue</b> of Active Galactic Nuclei {{selected}} from optical identifications of X-ray sources was {{created as a}} combination of two samples: Hamburg-ROSAT Catalogue (HRC) and Byurakan-Hamburg-ROSAT Catalogue (BHRC). Both are based on optical identifications of X-ray sources from ROSAT catalogues using low-dispersion spectra of Hamburg Quasar Survey (HQS). However, HRC and BHRC contain a number of misidentifications and using the recent optical and multiwavelength (MW) catalogues we have revised both samples excluding false AGN and adding new genuine ones. Thus a new large homogeneous complete sample of 4253 X-ray selected AGN was created. 3352 of them {{are listed in the}} Catalogue of QSOs and Active Galaxies and 387 also are in Roma Multifrequency Catalogue of Blazars. 901 candidate AGN are subject for further study. We classified 173 of these objects using their SDSS DR 12 spectra. Following activity types were revealed: 61 AGN, 21 HII galaxies, 12 emission-line galaxies without definite type, 71 absorption-line galaxies, 2 stars, and 6 were classified as "Unknown". A special emphasis is made on narrow-line Sy 1. 0 -Sy 1. 5 galaxies and QSOs, as many of them have soft X-ray, strong FeII lines, and relatively narrow lines coming from BLR ("narrow broad lines"). As a result, the sample of genuine AGN was enlarged to 3413 objects. We have retrieved MW data from recent catalogues and carried out statistical investigations for the whole AGN sample. An attempt to find connections between fluxes in different bands for different types of sources, and identify their characteristics thus confirming candidate AGNs have been carried out. We have analyzed X-ray properties of these sources to find a limit between normal galaxies and X-ray AGN.

40|$|Co-operation {{should lead}} to greater reader satisfaction. Large urban areas may {{have more than one}} {{university}} and other institutions of higher education, each possessing its own library, along with public and special libraries, all lying within a fairly small geographical area. To students and research workers ease of access to a variety of libraries in the area seems attractive and the relative usefulness of their services important. Undergraduates should naturally expect to have most of their needs satisfied in their own institution, but graduate students and staff may often expect to use other libraries in the neighbourhood. It is the aim of some libraries in conurbations to recognise, evaluate and meet these expectations. Examples are given of the following main areas of activity in Great Britain: Joint records of stock as special projects or fully co-operative <b>cataloguing.</b> <b>Joint</b> announcements of services available from a group of libraries. Co-operative stock building designed to achieve better coverage for the whole area. Staff co-operation and interchange. Local inter-lending services. Unification of administrative procedures. The problems met in general are considered under the following main headings: Different aims of institutions of higher education and hence of libraries. Different views of degree of public access among libraries of all types. Financial inability or unwillingness to join the co-operative arrangements. Geographical difficulties (e. g. public transport or parking problems). Impact of regional and national schemes of co-operation. Uncertainty of academic aims of institutions. Practical problems encountered in the Greater Manchester area are considered, the results so far achieved evaluated and comparisons drawn from other areas of urban cooperation in Great Britain. The justification for local efforts at a time of increasing mechanisation and perhaps of more efficient nationial schemes is discussed. Conclusions involve weighing the advantage to readers of local schemes against cost in financial and 2 ̆ 2 political 2 ̆ 2 terms, the gains and losses to users of less independence for the members of co-operative undertakings and an assessment of how far libraries near in geographical terms are really so in terms of the movement and interests of various types of user...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to analyze the book {{catalogue}} of Novosel’s bookstore, which operated in Zagreb from 1794 to 1825, and investigate the history of books and writing in Zagreb {{at the turn of}} the 19 th century. The catalogue we analyzed is believed to have been published in 1801. Bearing in mind that the market-based economy started to develop in the late 18 th century, it can be stipulated that Novosel and his staff and successors based the offer in their bookstore on market analysis, i. e. their readers’ needs. The increase in offer has sparked off new advertising techniques, i. e. printing of catalogues. It follows that their book catalogue reflects the image of the cultural and intellectual status and needs of readers in those times. The paper provides a short overview of book trade in the late 18 th century Zagreb and of bookstore advertisements published both in books and individually, as well as a short overview of Novosel’s bookstore business. In the analysis we partly use the methodology introduced by Robert Darnton, the so-called Darnton’s circle, which takes a holistic view of the history of books taking into consideration all stages a book needs to go through - from the author, publisher, printer, bookstores, to readers, including the author him/herself as a reader. Every element is considered in relation to other elements in the circle, and in connection with external factors such as the economic and social environment, and political and intellectual influences. The books presented in the catalogue have been analyzed using different criteria: language, genre and country where they were printed. Books printed in Croatia and those written in Croatian have been given priority. In the catalogue analysis we used the database Skupni katalog hrvatskih knjižnica (<b>joint</b> Croatian library <b>catalogue)</b> in order to reconstruct the printing year and printing shops that have not been listed in the catalogues. Using this methodology, we partly analyzed external factors that influenced the bookstore business and offer. In order to make a more detailed analysis, we would have to get an insight into archive documents on printing house and bookstore businesses of the time. The analysis of the book catalogue language and genre has shown that {{at the turn of the}} 19 the century books in German prevailed in bookstores, which bears witness to the orientation of Northern Croatia towards German-speaking countries. The genre analysis has shown that there was a large number of books from the field of literature, economy and science, and fewer books on theology, which clearly indicated the influence of enlightenment. As bookstores at the turn of the 19 th century were market-based to a large extent, their offer had to be based on the real needs of their readers. It is therefore justified to analyze bookstore catalogues as resources for book history, history of reading and history of culture in general. The analysis has shown that bookstore catalogues can also be used as a resource by literary historians, and we therefore propose different models of analyzing bookstore and printing business at the turn of the 19 th century.

40|$|Cilj je rada na temelju analize knjižarskog kataloga (Obznanenye) Novoselove knjižareistražiti povijest knjige i čitanja u Zagrebu na prijelazu iz 18. u 19. stoljeće. Analiziranije katalog objavljen 1800. ili 1801. godine. Pretpostavka je da su Novosel i njegovisuradnici i nasljednici ponudu u knjižari temeljili na zahtjevima čitatelja. Rast ponude,ali i potražnje za knjigama poticao je i nove oblike oglašavanja, tj. pojavu samostalnihprodajnih kataloga. Slijedom toga analizirani knjižarski katalog predstavlja novioblik oglašavanja koji oslikava kulturno i intelektualno stanje i potrebe zagrebačkihčitatelja toga doba. Djela navedena u katalogu analizirana su s obzirom na jezik, žanr i zemlju tiska. Posebno su analizirana djela tiskana u Hrvatskoj i djela pisana na hrvatskom jeziku. Prianalizi kataloga korištena je i baza Skupnog kataloga hrvatskih knjižnica pomoću kojesu rekonstruirane godine tiska i tiskari hrvatskih knjiga koji nisu navedeni u katalogu. Jezična i žanrovska analiza kataloga pokazala je da se u Zagrebu na prijelazu iz 18. u 19. stoljeće tiskalo najviše knjiga na hrvatskom, a u knjižarama je u ponudi bilonajviše knjiga na njemačkom jeziku. Žanrovska analiza ukazala je na velik broj knjiga spodručja književnosti, gospodarstva i znanosti, što svjedoči o utjecaju prosvjetiteljstvana knjižarsku ponudu, iako je i dalje u ponudi bilo mnogo djela s područja teologije. Budući da se knjižarstvo u to doba moralo temeljiti na zahtjevima čitatelja, dokazanaje opravdanost analize knjižarskih kataloga kao izvora za povijest knjige, povijestčitanja i povijest kulture općenito.
