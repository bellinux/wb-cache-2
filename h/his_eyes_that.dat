25|$|In 2001, HLS {{managing}} {{director in the}} UK, Brian Cass, was beaten outside his home by three masked men — animal rights activist David Blenkinsop was sentenced {{to three years in}} prison for the attack — and HLS marketing director Andrew Gay was attacked on his doorstep with a chemical spray to <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> left him temporarily blinded.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} Fai's magical powers is the blue color of <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> {{allow him to}} perform spells, which also greatly {{increases}} his lifespan. His powers are effectively halved when Syaoran consumes his left eye and is forced to become a vampire using Kamui's blood to save his life. He gains regeneration, though he has to regularly drink Kurogane's blood. He later gives {{up the rest of}} his magic in order for Yūko to restore Kurogane's lost arm with a mechanical one. Later he recovers his lost left eye when the clone Syaoran is killed by Fei-Wang. Following Fei-Wang's death, he, Kurogane and Mokona decide to accompany the original Syaoran in a journey who is unable to stay in every dimension for a determined time. In Clamp's Kobato. anime and a xxxHolic chapter, Fai makes a guest appearance along with the original Syaoran, Kurogane and Mokona.|$|E
2500|$|In later life, {{the number}} of devotees and their devotion grew so large that Ramana became {{restricted}} in his daily routine. Measures {{had to be taken}} to prevent people touching him. Several times Ramana tried to escape from the ashram, to return to a life of solitude. Vasudeva reports: [...] "Bhagavan sat on a rock and said with tears in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> he would never again come to the Ashram and would go where he pleased and live in the forests or caves away from all men."}} ...|$|E
60|$|But it was <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>that</b> quelled Martin. That cold, blue, dukes-have-treated-me-as-an-elder-brother eye.|$|R
60|$|I saw in <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>that</b> if I flinched, {{he would}} draw the trigger.|$|R
60|$|Dorothy {{looked him}} over. Yes, he was shaggy, all right; {{but there was}} a twinkle in <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>that</b> seemed pleasant.|$|R
2500|$|On 25 July 1998, Berezovsky {{introduced}} Litvinenko to Vladimir Putin. He said: [...] "Go see Putin. Make yourself known. See what a {{great guy}} we have installed, with your help." [...] That was very same day when Vladimir Putin replaced Nikolay Kovalyov as the Director of the Federal Security Service, with help from Berezovsky Litvinenko reported to Putin on corruption in the FSB, but Putin was unimpressed. Litvinenko said to his wife after the meeting: [...] "I could see in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> he hated me." [...] Litvinenko said later {{that he was doing}} an investigation of Uzbek drug barons who received protection from the FSB, and Putin tried to stall the investigation to save his reputation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1853, Soutsos' {{opinions}} on language {{were laid out}} in his essay New School of the Written Word, or Resurrection of the Ancient Greek Language Understood by All (Νέα Σχολὴ τοῡ γραφομένου λόγου ἢ Ἀνάστασις τῆς ἀρχαίας ἑλληνικῆς γλώσσης ἐννοουμένης ὑπὸ πάντων), in which he objects to Korais' [...] "middle way" [...] in language reform in favour of fully reviving Ancient Greek, since in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> was the language understood by most Greeks. He goes on to dismiss Demotic Greek as a language ridden with dialects and not always intelligible. Soutsos' linguistic positions were {{in response to a}} larger topic of discussion popular in mid-19th century Greece, the Greek language question. His written proposal drew an immediate counter-attack from academic Konstantinos Asopios, notably in his essay The Soutseia, or Mr Panagiotis Soutsos scrutinized as a Grammarian, Philologist, Schoolmaster, Metrician and Poet (Τὰ Σούτσεια, ἤτοι Ὁ κύριος Παναγιώτης Σοῦτσος ἐν γραμματικοῖς, ἐν φιλολόγοῖς, ἐν σχολάρχαῖς, ἐν μετρικοῖς καὶ ἐν ποιηταῖς ἐξεταζόμενος). After pointing out errors and solecisms in Soutsos' own language, Asopios went on to defend Korais' [...] "simplifying" [...] approach on language, albeit with the addition of his own selection of archaisms. Their feud sparked a small war of pamphlets from other pedants competing to expose grammatical inconsistencies, errors and phrases literally translated from French in the works of their rivals, with proposals for implementing their own sets of rules.|$|E
60|$|The Belgian assured him, {{with tears}} in <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>that</b> he {{did not wish to}} die.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do as {{the knight}} bids,' said Malcolm, {{starting}} forth with colour on his cheek, light in <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>that</b> made him another being. 'In him there is help.' ...|$|R
60|$|She rose obediently. Then a fat {{man came}} out of the Court House, with a quill in his hand, and a merry twinkle in <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>that</b> Stephen resented.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} delighted, of course," [...] he replied with {{simulated}} confusion, {{but with a}} lurking gleam in <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>that</b> might have checked her, had she noticed it.|$|R
60|$|Rivera showed with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> he heard, {{but he made}} neither sign of assent nor dissent.|$|E
60|$|Thorne {{looked at}} her with a gleam in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> set her heart {{throbbing}} painfully fast.|$|E
60|$|She felt from <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> he {{knew what}} she was {{suffering}}, and was even suffering with her.|$|E
60|$|Miss Mackenzie sat {{thinking}} for some minutes before {{she gave her}} answer--or striving to think; {{but she was so}} completely under the terrible fire of <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>that</b> any thought was very difficult.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; she and Harvey are come to Mrs. Ledwich's, to {{stay over}} Sunday;' {{and there was}} a laugh in the corner of <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>that</b> {{convinced}} Ethel that the torrents of rain would be no protection.|$|R
6000|$|... “True, true,” {{interrupted}} the Judge, a little impatiently; “but {{here is a}} youth who needs no deception to lure him to his own benefit. I see, by <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>that</b> he fears nothing more than delay.” ...|$|R
60|$|As Giant drew {{in sight}} of the trap {{something}} caught <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> brought him stock still in wonder.|$|E
60|$|McTurk's lank frame {{stiffened}} {{in every}} muscle and his eyelids dropped half over <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>That</b> last was a war-signal.|$|E
60|$|He said no more, but I {{perceived}} {{from the}} expression of <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> he thought the question had been put.|$|E
60|$|About an {{hour later}} his valet came out, and I heard him {{telephone}} for an electric cab. Then out came Van Sweller, smiling, but with that sly, secretive design in <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>that</b> was puzzling me.|$|R
60|$|Day {{after day}} they met--somewhat less {{constantly}} than before; and thus {{two or three}} weeks went by. The end of September drew near, and she could see in <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>that</b> he might ask her again.|$|R
60|$|The veteran {{gazed at}} her, for a moment, with an {{expression}} of <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>that</b> denoted reviving tenderness; but gloomy doubts appeared to cross his mind again, and he shook his head, as he walked proudly away.|$|R
60|$|Only once an ugly look {{came into}} <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>That</b> was when Andrew {{had reached the}} middle of his second testimonial.|$|E
60|$|Clavering {{looked at}} her gravely with {{something}} in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> puzzled Miss Schuyler, who had expected a wittily graceful speech.|$|E
6000|$|... "His {{features}} expressed no anxiety, no hope; {{his heavy}} eyelids blinked upon <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> looked past me {{straight into the}} courtyard.|$|E
60|$|I WASN'T {{able to go}} {{to prayer}} meeting that evening because I had {{neuralgia}} in my face; but Thomas went, and the minute he came home I knew by the twinkle in <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>that</b> he had some news.|$|R
60|$|And as he spoke, {{he looked}} into the Prefect's face with the look of a man wrestling in some deadly struggle; so intense and terrible was the earnestness of <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>that</b> even the old soldier shrank before it.|$|R
6000|$|His raven locks, that richly curled, [...] <b>His</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>that</b> proud {{defiance}} hurled. [...] Have stol'n my Marian's love! [...] Had I been blest by nature's grace, [...] With such a form, {{with such}} a face, [...] Could I so treacherous prove? ...|$|R
60|$|His mother drew near, {{and looked}} so earnestly into <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>that</b> he at once divined that {{something}} unusual was the matter.|$|E
60|$|Philip did not answer, but the {{headmaster}} read in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> he realised already something {{of what he}} tried to indicate.|$|E
60|$|He {{gazed at}} the singer, and though he was not musical, there came a look into <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>that</b> he quickly hid away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mischief," [...] {{deliberately}} {{returned the}} squatter; {{but with a}} cool expression of defiance in <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>that</b> showed how little he was moved by the ill-concealed humour of his children. [...] "Mischief, boy; mischief! take you heed that the disorder don't spread." ...|$|R
60|$|At this {{there came}} a look in <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>that</b> I could not mistake. His {{education}} had been neglected in one essential and eminently British particular: he could not box. No more could I, you may say; but then I had the more impudence--and I had made the proposal.|$|R
60|$|The Skimmer {{showed no}} {{yielding}} of the nerves {{though it was}} evident, by his attitude of thought and the momentary fixedness of <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>that</b> he foresaw danger was near. Moving to the window, he {{looked out on the}} water, and instantly drew back, like one who wanted no further evidence.|$|R
