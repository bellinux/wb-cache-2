25|$|The {{numerical}} {{solution of the}} Navier–Stokes equations for turbulent flow is extremely difficult, and due to the significantly different mixing-length scales {{that are involved in}} turbulent flow, the stable solution of this requires such a fine mesh resolution that the computational time becomes significantly infeasible for calculation or <b>direct</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>simulation.</b> Attempts to solve turbulent flow using a laminar solver typically result in a time-unsteady solution, which fails to converge appropriately. To counter this, time-averaged equations such as the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS), supplemented with turbulence models, are used in practical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applications when modeling turbulent flows. Some models include the Spalart–Allmaras, –, –, and SST models, which add a variety of additional equations to bring closure to the RANS equations. Large eddy simulation (LES) {{can also be used to}} solve these equations numerically. This approach is computationally more expensive—in time and in computer memory—than RANS, but produces better results because it explicitly resolves the larger turbulent scales.|$|E
500|$|A {{simplified}} two-dimensional {{model for}} the spread of wildfires that used convection to represent the effects of wind and terrain, as well as radiative heat transfer as the dominant method of heat transport led to reaction-diffusion systems of partial differential equations. More complex models join numerical weather models or computational fluid dynamics models with a wildfire component which allow the feedback effects between the fire and the atmosphere to be estimated. [...] The additional complexity in the latter class of models translates to a corresponding increase in their computer power requirements. In fact, a full three-dimensional treatment of combustion via <b>direct</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>simulation</b> at scales relevant for atmospheric modeling is not currently practical because of the excessive computational cost such a simulation would require. [...] Numerical weather models have limited forecast skill at spatial resolutions under , forcing complex wildfire models to parameterize the fire in order to calculate how the winds will be modified locally by the wildfire, and to use those modified winds to determine {{the rate at which}} the fire will spread locally. [...] Although models such as Los Alamos' FIRETEC solve for the concentrations of fuel and oxygen, the computational grid cannot be fine enough to resolve the combustion reaction, so approximations must be made for the temperature distribution within each grid cell, as well as for the combustion reaction rates themselves.|$|E

40|$|Context. The {{recently}} developed test-field method permits to compute dynamo coefficients from global, <b>direct</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>simulations.</b> The subsequent {{use of these}} parameters in mean-field models enables us to compare self-consistent dynamo models with their mean-field counterparts. So far, this has been done for a simulation of rotating magnetoconvection and a simple benchmark dynamo, which are both (quasi-) stationary. Aims. It is shown that chaotically time-dependent dynamos in a low Rossby number regime may be appropriately described by corresponding mean-field results. Also, it is pointed out under which conditions mean-field models do not match <b>direct</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>simulations.</b> Methods. We solve the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in a rotating, spherical shell in the Boussinesq approximation. Based on this, we compute mean-field coefficients for several models {{with the help of}} the previously developed test-field method. The parameterization of the mean electromotive force by these coefficients is tested against <b>direct</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>simulations.</b> In addition, we use the determined dynamo coefficients in mean-field models and compare the outcome with azimuthally averaged fields from <b>direct</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>simulations.</b> Results. The azimuthally and time-averaged electromotive force in fast rotating dynamos is sufficiently well parameterized by the set of determined mean-field coefficients. In comparison to the previously considered (quasi-) stationary dynamo, the chaotic time-dependence leads to an improved scale separation and thus to a better agreement between <b>direct</b> <b>numerical</b> <b>simulations</b> and mean-field results.
