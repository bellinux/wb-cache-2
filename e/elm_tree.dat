5|$|In early 1816, the Territory {{approved}} a census and Pennington {{was named to}} be the census enumerator. The population of the territory {{was found to be}} 63,897, above the cutoff required for statehood. A constitutional convention met on June 10, 1816, in Corydon. Because of the heat of the season, the delegation moved outdoors on many days and wrote the constitution beneath the shade of a giant <b>elm</b> <b>tree.</b> The state's first constitution was completed on June 29, and elections were held in August to fill the offices of the new state government. In November Congress approved statehood.|$|E
5|$|The Waterloo {{position}} {{was a strong}} one. It consisted of a long ridge running east-west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along {{the crest of the}} ridge ran the Ohain road, a deep sunken lane. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was a large <b>elm</b> <b>tree</b> that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the bark}} {{functions}} as a protective barrier, it is itself attacked by boring insects such as beetles. These lay their eggs in crevices and the larvae chew {{their way through the}} cellulose tissues leaving a gallery of tunnels. This may allow fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the tree. Dutch elm disease is caused by a fungus (Ophiostoma species) carried from one <b>elm</b> <b>tree</b> to another by various beetles. The tree reacts to the growth of the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of nourishment and dies. In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were killed by this disease.|$|E

40|$|<b>Elm</b> <b>trees</b> (Ulmus spp.) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} landscape plants, widely used as ornamental trees to embellish parks and streets of different countries including Iran. <b>Elm</b> <b>trees</b> cultivation is seriously limited by biotic factors such as bacterial pathogens. Recently, bacterial wetwood has been identified as a common disease on <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> in Northwest Iran. In present study, in order to identify bacterial pathogens associated with <b>elm</b> <b>trees,</b> wetwood infected samples were collected from <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> showing wetwood symptom across Tabriz city and immediately transferred to the lab. After isolation and purification of isolates, hypersensitive reaction (HR), pathogenicity, biochemical and molecular tests were used to characterize the isolates. In total of 92 isolates obtained, 32 and 10 isolates were able to induce HR and wetwood symptoms on tobacco leaves and young branches of elm, respectively. Based on biochemical and molecular tests, the identity of the isolates studied were determined as Brevundimonas bullata, Paracoccus alcaliphilus, P. marcusii and Luteimonas aestuarii. To the best of our knowledge, this study shows that these four bacterial species here reported are responsible for the causal agent-complex of wetwood disease on <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> for the first time in the world...|$|R

5|$|On 19 August 1800, when Anning was 15 months old, {{an event}} {{occurred}} that {{became part of}} local lore. She was being held by a neighbour, Elizabeth Haskings, who was standing with two other women under an <b>elm</b> <b>tree</b> watching an equestrian show being put on by a travelling company of horsemen, when lightning struck the tree killing all three women below. Onlookers rushed the infant home where she was revived in a bath of hot water. A local doctor declared her survival miraculous. Her family {{said she had been}} a sickly baby before the event but afterwards she seemed to blossom. For years afterward members of her community would attribute the child's curiosity, intelligence and lively personality to the incident.|$|E

40|$|Since 1992 <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> {{have been}} treated with a {{biological}} control product Dutch Trig ® {{to protect them from}} infection by Ophiostoma novo-ulmi causing Dutch elm disease (DED). The active ingredient of the biocontrol product consists of the fungus Verticillium albo-atrum strain WCS 850. A conidiospore suspension of this fungus is injected into the vascular system of <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> at a height of 1. 3 m. This biocontrol product prevents healthy <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> from fungal infection transmitted by elm bark beetles. Dutch Trig ®, however, does not protect already infected trees or trees connected with diseased trees via root grafts. Since 2010, only 0. 1 % of the injected elms became infected with DED through beetle transmission and an additional 0. 4 % of the treated elms were infected through root contact in the Netherlands. Regression analysis considering all injected <b>elm</b> <b>trees</b> in the Netherlands since 1992 indicated that DED infection through beetle transmission had significantly decreased during the 24 years application of Dutch Trig ®. In 2015, approximately 28, 300 trees in five countries (Netherlands, USA, Germany, Canada and Sweden) were treated with Dutch Trig ® to protect valuable susceptible <b>elm</b> <b>trees,</b> mainly in urban environments. </p...|$|R

25|$|George C. Williams gave {{an example}} based around the <b>elm</b> <b>tree.</b> In {{the forest of}} this example, empty patches between trees can support one {{individual}} each. When a patch becomes available because {{of the death of}} a tree, other trees' seeds will compete to fill the patch. Since the chance of a seed's success in occupying the patch depends upon its genotype, and a parent cannot anticipate which genotype is most successful, each parent will send many seeds, creating competition between siblings. Natural selection therefore favours parents which can produce a variety of offspring (see lottery principle).|$|E

25|$|Traditional Ainu {{culture was}} quite {{different}} from Japanese culture. Never shaving after a certain age, the men had full beards and moustaches. Men and women alike cut their hair level with the shoulders {{at the sides of}} the head, trimmed semicircularly behind. The women tattooed their mouths, and sometimes the forearms. The mouth tattoos were started at a young age with a small spot on the upper lip, gradually increasing with size. The soot deposited on a pot hung over a fire of birch bark was used for colour. Their traditional dress was a robe spun from the inner bark of the <b>elm</b> <b>tree,</b> called attusi or attush. Various styles were made, and consisted generally of a simple short robe with straight sleeves, which was folded around the body, and tied with a band about the waist. The sleeves ended at the wrist or forearm and the length generally was to the calves. Women also wore an undergarment of Japanese cloth.|$|E
