5000|$|Like all ALPs, it {{incorporates}} {{into the}} cell membrane and does not target the DNA. In many tumor cells, it causes selective apoptosis, sparing healthy cells. [...] <b>Edelfosine</b> can activate the Fas/CD95 cell death receptor, can inhibit the MAPK/ERK mitogenic pathway and the Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) survival pathway. [...] Aside from these plasma-level effects, <b>edelfosine</b> also affects gene expression by modulating the expression and activity of transcription factors.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Edelfosine</b> apoptosis-inducing {{abilities}} {{were studied}} with {{several types of}} cancer, among them multiple myeloma and non-small and small cell lung carcinoma cell lines.

5000|$|Alky-lysophospholipids (ALP) are {{synthetic}} analogues of lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC), {{also called}} lysolecithins.

They have anti-neoplastic (“anti-cancer”) [...] and immune modulating effects. Their anti-tumor effects are due to modulation of intracellular signalling pathways, inducing apoptosis. It is highly selective, sparing healthy cells. Several like <b>edelfosine,</b> miltefosine and perifosine are under research and development as drugs against cancer and other diseases.|$|E
5000|$|LPCs {{are present}} as minor {{phospholipids}} {{in the cell}} membrane (≤ 3%) and in the blood plasma (8-12%).

40|$|AbstractThe surface {{activity}} and interaction with lipid monolayers and bilayers of the antitumour ether lipid 1 -O-octadecyl- 2 -O-methyl-rac-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (<b>edelfosine)</b> have been studied. <b>Edelfosine</b> is a surface-active soluble amphiphile, with critical micellar concentrations at 3. 5  μM and 19  μM in water. When the air–water interface {{is occupied by}} a phospholipid, <b>edelfosine</b> becomes inserted in the phospholipid monolayer, increasing surface pressure. This increase is dose-dependent, and reaches a plateau at ca. 2  μM <b>edelfosine</b> bulk concentration. The ether lipid can become inserted in phospholipid monolayers with initial surface pressures of up to 33  mN/m, which ensures its capacity to become inserted into cell membranes. Upon interaction with phospholipid vesicles, <b>edelfosine</b> exhibits a weak detergent activity, causing release of vesicle contents to a low extent (< 5 %), and {{a small proportion of}} lipid solubilization. The weak detergent properties of <b>edelfosine</b> can be related to its very low critical micellar concentrations. Its high affinity for lipid monolayers combined with low lytic properties support the use of <b>edelfosine</b> as a clinical drug.

40|$|Leishmaniasis is the world's second deadliest {{parasitic}} disease after malaria, and current {{treatment of the}} different forms of this disease is far from satisfactory. Alkylphospholipid analogs (APLs) are a family of anticancer drugs that show antileishmanial activity, including the first oral drug (miltefosine) for leishmaniasis and drugs in preclinical/clinical oncology trials, but their precise mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. Here we show that the tumor cell apoptosis-inducer <b>edelfosine</b> was the most effective APL, as compared to miltefosine, perifosine and erucylphosphocholine, in killing Leishmania spp. promastigotes and amastigotes as well as tumor cells, as assessed by DNA breakdown determined by flow cytometry. In studies using animal models, we found that orally-administered <b>edelfosine</b> showed a potent in vivo antileishmanial activity and diminished macrophage pro-inflammatory responses. <b>Edelfosine</b> was also able to kill Leishmania axenic amastigotes. <b>Edelfosine</b> was taken up by host macrophages and killed intracellular Leishmania amastigotes in infected macrophages. <b>Edelfosine</b> accumulated in tumor cell mitochondria and Leishmania kinetoplast-mitochondrion, and led to mitochondrial transmembrane potential disruption, and to the successive breakdown of parasite mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. Ectopic expression of Bcl-XL inhibited edelfosine-induced cell death in both Leishmania parasites and tumor cells.

We hypothesized that this lipid could interact with plasma membrane ion channels and modulate their function. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Using cell migration-proliferation assays, patch clamp, spectrofluorimetry and ¹²⁵I-Apamin binding experiments, we studied {{the effects of}} <b>edelfosine</b> on the migration of breast cancer MDA-MB- 435 s cells, mediated by the small conductance Ca²(+) -activated K(+) channel, SK 3 /K(Ca) 2. 3. KEY RESULTS: <b>Edelfosine</b> (1 µM) caused plasma membrane depolarization by substantially inhibiting activity of SK 3 /K(Ca) 2. 3 channels, which we had previously demonstrated {{to play an important}} role in cancer cell migration. <b>Edelfosine</b> did not inhibit ¹²⁵I-Apamin binding to this SK(Ca) channel; rather, it reduced the calcium sensitivity of SK 3 /K(Ca) 2. 3 channel and dramatically decreased intracellular Ca²(+) concentration, probably by insertion in the plasma membrane, as suggested by proteinase K experiments. <b>Edelfosine</b> reduced cell migration to the same extent as known SK(Ca) channel blockers. In contrast, K+ channel openers prevented edelfosine-induced anti-migratory effects. SK 3 protein knockdown decreased cell migration and totally abolished the effect of <b>edelfosine</b> on MDA-MB- 435 s cell migration. In contrast, transient expression of SK 3 /K(Ca) 2. 3 protein in a SK 3 /K(Ca) 2. 3 -deficient cell line increased cell migration and made these cells responsive to <b>edelfosine.</b> CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our data clearly establish <b>edelfosine</b> as an inhibitor of cancer cell migration by acting on SK 3 /K(Ca) 2. 3 channels and provide insights into the future development of a new class of migration-targeted, anti-cancer agents...|$|E
40|$|Background: Recent {{evidence}} suggests that co-clustering of Fas/CD 95 death receptor and lipid rafts {{plays a major role}} in death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Methodology/Principal Findings: By a combination of genetic, biochemical, and ultrastructural approaches, we provide here compelling evidence for the involvement of lipid raft aggregates containing recruited Fas/CD 95 death receptor, Fas-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD), and procaspase- 8 in the induction of apoptosis in human T-cell leukemia Jurkat cells by the antitumor drug <b>edelfosine,</b> the prototype compound of a promising family of synthetic antitumor lipids named as synthetic alkyl-lysophospholipid analogues. Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that <b>edelfosine</b> induced the generation of the so-called death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), made up of Fas/CD 95, FADD, and procaspase- 8, in lipid rafts. Electron microscopy analyses allowed to visualize the formation of raft clusters and their co-localization with DISC components Fas/CD 95, FADD, and procaspase- 8 following <b>edelfosine</b> treatment of Jurkat cells. Silencing of Fas/CD 95 by RNA interference, transfection with a FADD dominant-negative mutant that blocks Fas/CD 95 signaling, and specific inhibition of caspase- 8 prevented the apoptotic response triggered by <b>edelfosine,</b> hence demonstrating the functional role of DISC in drug-induced apoptosis.

40|$|International audienceActivation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) {{signaling}} pathway is known to protect tumor cells from apoptosis and more specifically from the Fas-mediated apoptotic signal.

Furthermore, similarly to <b>edelfosine,</b> blockade of the PI 3 K activity, using specific inhibitors LY 294002 and wortmannin, leads to the clustering of Fas whose supramolecular complex is colocalized within the lipid rafts.

In this study we determined that α-tocopherol protects cells from the <b>edelfosine</b> cytotoxic effect, preventing the internalization of sterols and the plasma membrane proton pump ATPase, Pma 1 p. Two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses were considered to explain the protective effect of α-tocopherol: (i) its classical antioxidant activity is necessary to break progression of lipid peroxidation, despite the fact Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not possess polyunsaturated fatty acids and (ii) due to its complementary cone shape, insertion of α-tocopherol could correct membrane curvature stress imposed by <b>edelfosine</b> (inverted cone shape). We then developed tools to distinguish between these two hypotheses and dissect the structural requirements that confer α-tocopherol its protective effect. Our results indicated its lipophilic nature and the H donating hydroxyl group from the chromanol ring are both required to counteract the cytotoxic effect of <b>edelfosine,</b> suggesting <b>edelfosine</b> induces oxidation of membrane components. To further support this finding and {{learn more about the}} early cellular response to <b>edelfosine</b> we investigated the role that known oxidative stress signaling pathways play in modulating sensitivity to the lipid drug.

[Methods]: A modified version of a previously described assay for the intracellular conversion of nitro blue tetrazolium to formazan by superoxide anion {{was used to measure}} the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Apoptotic yeast cells were detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. DNA fragmentation and the generation of ROS were measured by cytofluorimetric analysis in Jurkat cells. [Results]: <b>Edelfosine</b> induced apoptosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as assessed by TUNEL assay. Meanwhile, <b>edelfosine</b> induced a time- and concentration-dependent generation of ROS in yeasts. Rotenone, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, prevented ROS generation and apoptosis in response to <b>edelfosine</b> in S cerevisiae. α-Tocopherol abrogated the edelfosine-induced generation of intracellular ROS and apoptosis. <b>Edelfosine</b> also induced an increase of ROS in human leukemic cells that preceded apoptosis. The overexpression of Bcl- 2 by gene transfer abrogated both ROS generation and apoptosis induced by <b>edelfosine</b> in leukemic cells. Changes in the relative mito-chondrial membrane potential were detected in both yeasts and Jurkat cells. [Conclusion]: These results indicate that <b>edelfosine</b> induces apoptosis in yeasts in addition to human tumor cells, and this apoptotic process involves mitochondria, likely through mitochondrial-derived ROS.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is a {{parasitic}} disease caused by trematodes {{of the genus}} Schistosoma. Five species of Schistosoma are known to infect humans, out of which S. haematobium is the most prevalent, causing the chronic {{parasitic disease}} schistosomiasis that still represents a major problem of public health in many {{regions of the world}} and especially in tropical areas, leading to serious manifestations and mortality in developing countries. Since the 1970 s, praziquantel (PZQ) is the drug of choice for the treatment of schistosomiasis, but concerns about relying on a single drug to treat millions of people, and the potential appearance of drug resistance, make identification of alternative schistosomiasis chemotherapies a high priority. Alkylphospholipid analogs (APLs), together with their prototypic molecule <b>edelfosine</b> (EDLF), are a family of synthetic antineoplastic compounds that show additional pharmacological actions, including antiparasitic activities against several protozoan parasites. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found APLs ranked edelfosine> perifosine> erucylphosphocholine> miltefosine for their in vitro schistosomicidal activity against adult S. mansoni worms. <b>Edelfosine</b> accumulated mainly in the worm tegument, and led to tegumental alterations, membrane permeabilization, motility impairment, blockade of male-female pairing as well as induction of apoptosis-like processes in cells in the close vicinity to the tegument. <b>Edelfosine</b> oral treatment also showed in vivo schistosomicidal activity and decreased significantly the egg burden in the liver, a key event in schistosomiasis.

M., Gajate, C., Hornillos, V., Delgado, J., Zhang, H., Amat-Guerri, F., Acuña, A. U., McMaster, C. R., Revuelta, J. L., Zaremberg, V., and Mollinedo, F. (January 23, 2013) J. Biol. Chem. 288,), respectively. Our results point to maintenance of pH homeostasis as {{a major player in}} modulating susceptibility to <b>edelfosine</b> with the PM proton pump Pma 1 p playing a main role. We demonstrate that <b>edelfosine</b> alters PM organization and induces intracellular acidification. Significantly, we show that <b>edelfosine</b> selectively reduces lateral segregation of PM proteins like Pma 1 p and nutrient H+-symporters inducing their ubiquitination and internalization. The biology associated to the mode of action of <b>edelfosine</b> we have unveiled includes selective modification of lipid raft integrity altering pH homeostasis, which in turn regulates cell growth. © 2013 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

40|$|Synthetic alkyl-lysophospholipids {{represent}} {{a family of}} promising anticancer drugs that induce apoptosis {{in a variety of}} tumor cells. Here we have found a differential subcellular distribution of the alkyl-lysophospholipid <b>edelfosine</b> in leukemic and solid tumor cells that leads to distinct anticancer responses. <b>Edelfosine</b> induced rapid apoptosis in human leukemic cells, including acute T-cell leukemia Jurkat and Peer cells, but promoted a late apoptotic response, preceded by G 2 /M arrest, in human solid tumor cells such as cervix epitheloid carcinoma HeLa cells and lung carcinoma A 549 cells. c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and caspase- 3 were accordingly activated at earlier times in edelfosine-treated Jurkat cells as compared with drug-treated HeLa cells. Both leukemic and solid tumor cells took up this alkyl-lysophospholipid and expressed the two putative <b>edelfosine</b> targets, namely cell surface Fas death receptor (also known as APO- 1 or CD 95) and endoplasmic reticulum CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase. However, <b>edelfosine</b> was mainly located to plasma membrane lipid rafts in Jurkat and Peer leukemic cells and to endoplasmic reticulum in solid tumor HeLa and A 549 cells. <b>Edelfosine</b> induced translocation of Fas, Fas-associated death domain-containing protein, and JNK into membrane rafts in Jurkat cells, but not in HeLa cells. In contrast, <b>edelfosine</b> inhibited phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in both HeLa and A 549 cells, but not in Jurkat or Peer leukemic cells, before the triggering of apoptosis. These data indicate that <b>edelfosine</b> targets two different subcellular structures in a cell type-dependent manner, namely cell surface lipid rafts in leukemic cells and endoplasmic reticulum in solid tumor cells. © 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

40|$|Background/Aims: The anti-inflammatory, anti-autoimmune, antiparasitic, and anti-viral ether {{phospholipid}} <b>edelfosine</b> (1 -O-octadecyl- 2 -O-methylglycero- 3 -phosphocholine) stimulates apoptosis of {{tumor cells}} {{and is thus}} considered {{for the treatment of}} malignancy. Similar to apoptosis of nucleated cells, erythrocytes may enter eryptosis, the suicidal erythrocyte death characterized by cell shrinkage and phospholipid scrambling of the cell membrane with phosphatidylserine translocation to the erythrocyte surface. Triggers of eryptosis include Ca 2 + entry with increase of cytosolic Ca 2 + activity ([Ca 2 +]i) and oxidative stress. The present study explored, whether and how <b>edelfosine</b> induces eryptosis. Methods: Flow cytometry and photometry, respectively, were employed to estimate phosphatidylserine exposure at the cell surface from annexin-V-binding, cell volume from forward scatter, hemolysis from hemoglobin release, [Ca 2 +]i from Fluo 3 -fluorescence, and abundance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from 2 ', 7 '-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) fluorescence. Results: A 6 hours exposure of human erythrocytes to <b>edelfosine</b> (5 µM) significantly increased the percentage of annexin-V-binding cells, significantly decreased forward scatter, and significantly increased Fluo 3 -fluorescence, but did not significantly modify DCFDA fluorescence. The effect of <b>edelfosine</b> on annexin-V-binding was significantly blunted, but not abolished by removal of extracellular Ca 2 +. Conclusions: <b>Edelfosine</b> triggers cell shrinkage and phospholipid scrambling of the erythrocyte cell membrane, an effect in part due to stimulation of Ca 2 + entry...|$|E
40|$|The surface {{activity}} and interaction with lipid monolayers and bilayers of the antitumour ether lipid 1 -O-octadecyl- 2 -O-methyl-rac-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (<b>edelfosine)</b> have been studied. <b>Edelfosine</b> is a surface-active soluble amphiphile, with critical micellar concentrations at 3. 5  μM and 19  μM in water. When the air-water interface {{is occupied by}} a phospholipid, <b>edelfosine</b> becomes inserted in the phospholipid monolayer, increasing surface pressure. This increase is dose-dependent, and reaches a plateau at ca. 2  μM <b>edelfosine</b> bulk concentration. The ether lipid can become inserted in phospholipid monolayers with initial surface pressures of up to 33  mN/m, which ensures its capacity to become inserted into cell membranes. Upon interaction with phospholipid vesicles, <b>edelfosine</b> exhibits a weak detergent activity, causing release of vesicle contents to a low extent (single-chain> lipids, e. g. lysophosphatidylcholine, palmitoylcarnitine, or N-acetylsphingosine. © 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|Purpose]: Mantle cell {{lymphoma}} (MCL) {{and chronic}} lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remain B-cell malignancies with limited therapeutic options. The present study investigates the in vitro and in vivo effect of the phospholipid ether <b>edelfosine</b> (1 -O-octadecyl- 2 -O-methyl-rac-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine) in MCL and CLL. [Experimental Design]: Several cell lines, patient-derived tumor cells, and xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient mice were {{used to examine the}} anti-MCL and anti-CLL activity of <b>edelfosine.</b> Furthermore, we analyzed the mechanism of action and drug biodistribution of <b>edelfosine</b> in MCL and CLL tumor-bearing severe combined immunodeficient mice. [Results]: Here, we have found that the phospholipid ether <b>edelfosine</b> was the most potent alkyl-lysophospholipid analogue in killing MCL and CLL cells, including patient-derived primary cells, while sparing normal resting lymphocytes. Alkyl-lysophospholipid analogues ranked <b>edelfosine</b> > perifosine ≫ erucylphosphocholine ≥ miltefosine in their capacity to elicit apoptosis in MCL and CLL cells. <b>Edelfosine</b> induced coclustering of Fas/CD 95 death receptor and rafts in MCL and CLL cells. <b>Edelfosine</b> was taken up by malignant cells, whereas normal resting lymphocytes hardly incorporated the drug. Raft disruption by cholesterol depletion inhibited drug uptake, Fas/CD 95 clustering, and edelfosine-induced apoptosis. <b>Edelfosine</b> oral administration showed a potent in vivo anticancer activity in MCL and CLL xenograft mouse models, and the drug accumulated dramatically and preferentially in the tumor. [Conclusions]: Our data indicate that <b>edelfosine</b> accumulates and kills MCL and CLL cells in a rather selective way, and set coclustering of Fas/CD 95 and lipid rafts as a new framework in MCL and CLL therapy.

40|$|In humans, {{the deadly}} {{neurodegenerative}} Niemann Pick Type-C disease (NPC) {{is caused by}} loss of function mutations in the NPC 1 gene, which chiefly affect Purkinje neurons of the brain. While the underlying cause of NPC {{is believed to be}} lysosomal cholesterol accumulation, recent studies suggest that other lipid, protein and calcium defects contribute to the cellular defects in NPC. In contrast, deletion of the yeast NPC 1 homologue, NCR 1, does not cause any obvious growth or sterol trafficking defects. However, ncr 1 Δ cells are resistant to <b>edelfosine,</b> a phosphatidylcholine (PC) analogue drug that disrupts PC synthesis and distribution. Examination of PC trafficking in <b>edelfosine</b> treated ncr 1 Δ cells suggested that NCR 1 deletion suppressed edelfosine-induced vacuolar PC trafficking defects. Ybt 1 p, the vacuolar membrane PC importer was found to be important for vacuolar PC uptake in <b>edelfosine</b> treated ncr 1 Δ cells. Because Ybt 1 p affects vacuolar calcium levels and human NPC neurons show calcium defects, ncr 1 Δ cells were tested for calcium phenotypes, where we found that these mutants were sensitive to high calcium concentrations. Both the ncr 1 ∆-associated <b>edelfosine</b> and calcium defects were exacerbated in cells expressing multicopy LEU 2, which encodes an enzyme required for leucine biosynthesis. Because leucine activates the vacuolar Target Of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC 1), we investigated a potential link between Ncr 1 p and TORC 1. Like ncr 1 Δ cells, several TORC 1 -associated mutants were <b>edelfosine</b> resistant and a mutation causing constitutive TORC 1 activation exacerbated ncr 1 Δ <b>edelfosine</b> resistance. This work uncovered novel PC- and calcium-related defects in ncr 1 Δ yeast cells, which might provide insights into conserved functions of Ncr 1 p/NPC 1 that relate to defects in NPC-affected Purkinje neurons. This phenotypic analysis also implicates TORC 1 in some aspect of Ncr 1 p function in yeast...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The leishmaniases are {{a complex}} of {{neglected}} tropical diseases caused by more than 20 Leishmania parasite species, for which available therapeutic arsenal is scarce and unsatisfactory. Pentavalent antimonials (SbV) are currently the first-line pharmacologic therapy for leishmaniasis worldwide, but resistance to these compounds is increasingly reported. Alkyl-lysophospoholipid analogs (ALPs) constitute a family of compounds with antileishmanial activity, {{and one of its}} members, miltefosine, has been approved as the first oral treatment for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. However, its clinical use can be challenged by less impressive efficiency in patients infected with some Leishmania species, including L. braziliensis and L. mexicana, and by proneness to develop drug resistance in vitro. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found that ALPs ranked edelfosine>perifosine>miltefosine>erucylphosphocholine for their antileishmanial activity and capacity to promote apoptosis-like parasitic cell death in promastigote and amastigote forms of distinct Leishmania spp., as assessed by proliferation and flow cytometry assays. Effective antileishmanial ALP concentrations were dependent on both the parasite species and their development stage. <b>Edelfosine</b> accumulated in and killed intracellular Leishmania parasites within macrophages. In vivo antileishmanial activity was demonstrated following oral treatment with <b>edelfosine</b> of mice and hamsters infected with L. major, L. panamensis or L. braziliensis, without any significant side-effect. <b>Edelfosine</b> also killed SbV-resistant Leishmania parasites in in vitro and in vivo assays, and required longer incubation times than miltefosine to generate drug resistance. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data reveal that <b>edelfosine</b> is the most potent ALP in killing different Leishmania spp., and it is less prone to lead to drug resistance development than miltefosine. <b>Edelfosine</b> is effective in killing Leishmania in culture and within macrophages, as well as in animal models infected with different Leishmania spp. and SbV-resistant parasites. Our results indicate that <b>edelfosine</b> is a promising orally administered antileishmanial drug for clinical evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Analysis of {{the effect}} of <b>edelfosine,</b> {{ilmofosine}} and miltefosine on Leishmania amazonensis and of potential targets of these lysophospholipid analogues. Methods: Quantification and ultrastructural analysis {{of the effect}} of lysophospholipid analogues on promastigote forms and on infected peritoneal macrophages, and flow cytometry analysis of treated promastigotes labelled with propidium iodide and rhodamine 123 (Rh 123). Results: The lysophospholipid analogues presented potent antiproliferative activity with IC 50 / 3 days of 1. 9 – 3. 4 mM for promastigotes and 4. 2 – 9. 0 mM for intracellular amastigotes. Treatment with these ana-logues in Schneider medium for 1 day led to a dose-dependent decrease in Rh 123 fluorescence, an effect more accentuated in edelfosine-treated parasites, suggesting interference with the potential of the mitochondrial membrane. In both forms of L. amazonensis, <b>edelfosine</b> induced extensive mito-chondrial damage, multinucleation and, in promastigotes, also led to plasma membrane alterations, formation of autophagic structures and membranous arrangements inside the flagellar pocket. Conclusions: The alkylglycerophosphocholines <b>edelfosine</b> and ilmofosine were more active than the alkylphosphocholine miltefosine against promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes of L. amazonen-sis, and ultrastructural and flow cytometry data indicate the mitochondrion as a target of <b>edelfosine...</b>|$|E
40|$|Leishmaniasis {{represents}} {{a major international}} health problem, has a high morbidity and mortality rate, and is classified as an emerging and uncontrolled disease by the World Health Organization. The migration of population from endemic to nonendemic areas, and tourist activities in endemic regions are spreading the disease to new areas. Unfortunately, treatment of leishmaniasis is far from satisfactory, {{with only a few}} drugs available that show significant side-effects. Here, we show in vitro and in vivo evidence for the antileishmanial activity of the ether phospholipid <b>edelfosine,</b> being effective against a wide number of Leishmania spp. causing cutaneous, mucocutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. Our experimental mouse and hamster models demonstrated not only a significant antileishmanial activity of <b>edelfosine</b> oral administration against different wild-type Leishmania spp., but also against parasites resistant to pentavalent antimonials, which constitute the first line of treatment worldwide. In addition, <b>edelfosine</b> exerted a higher antileishmanial activity and a lower proneness to generate drug resistance than miltefosine, the first drug against leishmaniasis that can be administered orally. These data, together with our previous findings, showing an anti-inflammatory action and a very low toxicity profile, suggest that <b>edelfosine</b> is a promising orally administered drug for leishmaniasis, thus warranting clinical evaluation...|$|E
