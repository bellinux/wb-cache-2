In whole platelets, indomethacin reduced the increase in cyclic GMP induced by the nitric oxide-donors (NO-donors) sodium nitroprusside (NaNP) and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) in a dose-dependent way, its IC 50 being 13. 7 [*]μM and 15. 8 [*]μM, respectively. Of the other cyclooxygenase inhibitors tested, only <b>indoprofen</b> reduced the increase in cyclic GMP induced by both NO-donors in a dose-dependent way (IC 50 = 32. 7 [*]μM, NaNP and 25. 0 [*]μM, SNAP), while acetylsalicylic acid (up to 1000 [*]μM) and diclofenac (up to 100 [*]μM) were ineffective. However, in platelet crude homogenate neither indomethacin nor <b>indoprofen</b> reduced the cyclic GMP production.

40|$|The {{demanding}} for enantiomerically pure (enantiopure) compounds, {{especially for}} pharmaceutical field has been attracting great attention during last decades. Direct enantioseparation by chiral stationary phases (CSPs) using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) remains {{as the most}} important technique for enantioseparation. The development of novel stable and powerful CSPs is therefore important. The first part of this study involved a facile and reliable preparation of CSPs. Thus, β- cyclodextrin was functionalized with ionic liquids (ILs) namely 1 -benzylimidazole (1 - BzlIm) and 1 -decyl- 2 -methylimidazole (C 10 MIm) with tosylate as anion produced β- CD-BIMOTs and β-CD-DIMOTs respectively. β-CD-BIMOTs and β-CD-DIMOTs were attached to the modified silica to obtain the CSPs. The performances of the synthesized CSPs were determined by examining the capability of enantioseparation of selected analytes: flavonoids (flavanone, hesperetin, naringenin and eriodictyol), β- blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, pindolol and propranolol) and Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAIDs) (ibuprofen, fenoprofen, ketoprofen and <b>indoprofen).</b> The performance of β-CD-BIMOTs and β-CD-DIMOTs stationary phases was also compared with native β-CD stationary phase. The results indicated that β-CD-BIMOTs stationary phase afforded more favorable enantioseparations than β-CD-DIMOTs and native β-CD based stationary phases. Therefore, the optimization for enantioseparation of selected analytes (flavonoids, β-blockers and NSAIDs) and evaluation of interactions was further investigated on β-CD-BIMOTs stationary phase. The selected flavonoids, flavanone and hesperetin obtained high resolution factor in reverse phase mode. Meanwhile naringenin and eriodictyol attained partial enantioseparation in polar organic mode. In order to understand the mechanism of separation, the interaction of selected flavonoids and β-CD-BIMOTs was studied using spectroscopic methods which are 1 H NMR, NOESY and UV/Vis spectrophotometry. The result for enantioseparation of selected β-blockers, propranolol and metoprolol showed good enantioresolution compared to atenolol and pindolol. The results suggested that the lipophilic property and the structure of propranolol and metoprolol that enable the formation of inclusion complex contribute to better enantioseparation. This observation was proven by 1 H NMR and NOESY of β-CD-BIMOTs/β-blockers. The effect of the types and variation of mobile phase composition on enantioseparation of NSAIDs was also studied on β- CD-BIMOTs CSP. From the result of enantioseparation, ibuprofen and <b>indoprofen</b> achieved the better resolution than ketoprofen and fenoprofen due to their favorable orientation to fit into the β-CD-BIMOTs cavity.

40|$|Using bovine {{vesicular}} gland microsomes and [14 C]indomethacin we {{demonstrated the}} presence of a specific binding site for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Specific binding of [14 C]indomethacin to microsomes was rapid, with most of the ligand bound by 2 min at 4 degrees C. In routine binding assays the incubation temperature was maintained at 4 degrees C, because the maximal specific binding was obtained. Specific [14 C]indomethacin binding appeared to increase linearly with increasing protein concentration over the range of 0. 1 - 1. 0 mg of microsomal protein. Specific binding was saturable and Scatchard analysis of binding data showed a single class of binding sites with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 3. 8 microM and a maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) of about 1272 pmol/mg of protein. When these binding data were plotted according to the Hill equation, a straight line was obtained with a Hill coefficient of 1. 0. Structural specificity of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug site was studied with diclofenac, arylpropionic acids (ketoprofen and <b>indoprofen),</b> and aspirin.

40|$|<b>Indoprofen,</b> {{despite its}} {{relatively}} short plasma half-life, {{was just as}} effective given twice daily as when the same daily total was given in four divided doses. There was a trend in favour of the twice daily regime for changes in morning pain and the duration of morning stiffness. Preferences were equally divided between the two regimes and efficacy was the usual reason for patients preferring one or other. Side-effects were no more frequent with the twice daily regime. Pharmacokinetics are no substitute for clinical experiment in planning the dosage regime of a non-steroidal anti-inflamma-tory drug. THE frequency of administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is usually based on pharmacokinetics. It is supposed that anti-inflammatory drugs are like antibiotics and that those with short plasma half-lives must be given frequently {{in order to maintain}} an effective plasma level. But there"is very little evidence to link plasma levels with response. It has not been possible to show correlations between plasma levels and response; differ-ences in pharmacokinetics do not explain the wide individual variation in response to drugs of this class (Huskisson et al., 1979).

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the true impact of each single {{enantiomer}} of pharmacologically active compounds (PACs) in the environment, highly efficient, fast and sensitive analytical methods are needed. For {{the first time this}} paper focuses on the use of ultrahigh performance supercritical fluid based chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer to develop multi-residue enantioselective methods for chiral PACs in environmental matrices. This technique exploits the advantages of supercritical fluid chromatography, ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Two coated modified 2. 5 μm-polysaccharide-based chiral stationary phases were investigated: an amylose tris- 3, 5 -dimethylphenylcarbamate column and a cellulose tris- 3 -chloro- 4 -methylphenylcarbamate column. The effect of different chromatographic variables on chiral recognition is highlighted. This novel approach resulted in the baseline resolution of 13 enantiomers PACs (aminorex, carprofen, chloramphenicol, 3 -N-dechloroethylifosfamide, flurbiprofen, 2 -hydroxyibuprofen, ifosfamide, imazalil, naproxen, ofloxacin, omeprazole, praziquantel and tetramisole) and partial resolution of 2 enantiomers PACs (ibuprofen and <b>indoprofen)</b> under fast-gradient conditions (< 10 min analysis time).

The {{effect of the}} type of stationary phase, the chiral column Chirobiotic V or the achiral stationary phases Nucleosil 100 C 8 HD and Nucleosil 100 C 18 HD, and the concentration of vancomycin in the mobile phase on separation of the drug enantiomers were evaluated. All the drugs, except flobufen, were successfully enantioseparated on Nucleosil 100 C 8 HD with 4 mM vancomycin present in the mobile phase (composed of methanol and buffer) in the reversed phase mode. On the vancomycin-bonded chiral stationary phase, it was difficult to get enantioseparations of the profen NSAIDs. However, flobufen gave better enantioseparation on the vancomycin CSP. The better enantioresolution of the majority of profen derivatives on the achiral columns with vancomycin added to the mobile phase can be attributed in particular to the higher separation efficiency of this capillary chromatographic system. In addition, vancomycin dimers, formed in the mobile phase, seem to offer a better steric arrangement for stereoselective interaction to these analytes than the vancomycin bonded on the CSP.

Erythromycin A itself and five related substances namely erythromycin A N-oxide, anhydroerythromycin A, anhydroerythromycin A N-oxide, erythralosamine and erythralosamine N-oxide were included. Twenty-one chiral compounds with a wide difference in physico-chemical properties were used to test the chiral activity of the erythromycins. The chiral compounds were analysed using capillary zone electrophoresis with the erythromycins dissolved in the running buffer at different concentrations ranging from 0. 1 to 10 mM, with three different BGEs: sodium phosphate pHs 3. 0 and 7. 0 and sodium borate pH 9. 2. The erythromycins showed more interactions with the acidic compounds (as observed with leucovorin, dopa, carbidopa, ketoprofen, <b>indoprofen</b> and warfarin) than with the neutral or weakly basic ones, especially in acidic medium. Unfortunately, no chiral separations were obtained for any of the 21 racemic mixtures. The complexation constants were calculated for the compounds showing interaction, based on the variation of electrophoretic mobility of the compounds in the presence of different concentrations of erythromycins.

Inside-out vesicles from human erythrocytes contain a comparable ATP-dependent transport system. These results show that NAc-DNP-Cys and naphthyl glucuronide are high-affinity substrates for a single system identified previously as a low-affinity transporter of DNP-SG. Substrate and inhibitor studies identify this system as a novel multispecific organic-anion transport system (MOAT 4) that accommodates glucuronides and mercapturates and is distinct from other MOAT transporters. Human erythrocytes contain an additional ATP-dependent system for NAc-DNP-Cys (Km 33 microM) that does not transport monoglucuronides...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEthanol can {{increase}} the solubility of poorly soluble and hence present a higher drug concentration in the gastrointestinal tract. This may produce a faster and more effective absorption resulting in variable and/or high drug plasma concentrations, both of {{which can lead to}} adverse drug reactions. In this work we therefore studied the solubility and absorption effects of nine diverse compounds when ethanol was present. The apparent solubility was measured using the μDiss Profiler Plus (pION, MA) in four media representing gastric conditions with and without ethanol. The solubility results were combined with in-house data on solubility in intestinal fluids (with and without ethanol) and pharmacokinetic parameters extracted from the literature and used as input in compartmental absorption simulations using the software GI-Sim. Apparent solubility increased more than 7 -fold for non-ionized compounds in simulated gastric fluid containing 20 % ethanol. Compounds with weak base functions (cinnarizine, dipyridamole and terfenadine) were completely ionized at the studied gastric pH and their solubility was therefore unaffected by ethanol. Compounds with low solubility in intestinal media and a pronounced solubility increase due to ethanol in the upper gastric compartments showed an increased absorption in the simulations. The rate of absorption of the acidic compounds indomethacin and <b>indoprofen</b> was slightly increased but the extent of absorption was unaffected as the complete doses were readily absorbed even without ethanol. This was likely due to a high apparent solubility in the intestinal compartment where the weak acids are ionized. The absorption of the studied non-ionizable compounds increased when ethanol was present in the gastric and intestinal media. These results indicate that concomitant intake of alcohol may significantly increase the solubility and hence, the plasma concentration for non-ionizable, lipophilic compounds with the potential of adverse drug reactions to occur...|$|E
40|$|Amorphous solid dispersions {{are known}} to improve the oral {{bioavailability}} of poorly water-soluble drugs. However, the physical instability of solid dispersions leading to phase separation and subsequent crystallization is limiting their commercial use. Polymers used in solid dispersions have shown to inhibit drug crystallization by either increasing the glass transition temperature (T g) of the mixture; and/or by interacting with the drug. To effectively inhibit drug crystallization, the polymer has to remain miscible with the drug. Drug crystallization could occur if drug-carrier miscibility is adversely affected by heat or humidity. It is therefore {{important to understand the}} drug-carrier miscibility to define strategies for ensuring the physical stability of amorphous solid dispersions. In this study, an approach is presented with which one can determine the 2 ̆ 2 solid solubility 2 ̆ 2, defined as the amount of drug that remains miscible with the carrier under specified heat and humidity condition. Modulated differential scanning calorimeter (MDSC) was used to determine the solid solubility of trehalose, griseofulvin, and <b>indoprofen,</b> in amorphous polymers like PVP and dextran. Solid dispersions that exhibit single Tg, were exposed to accelerated storage conditions and their Tg(s) were monitored periodically. An increase in Tg or the fonnation of multiple Tgs indicated the phase separation of drug from the polymer. The Tg was monitored until a plateau was reached, indicating an equilibrium state and no further phase separation. The solid solubility of drug in the polymer was detennined from the calibration plot of Tg of freshly prepared solid dispersion vs. drug-polymer ratio. The mechanism of solid solubility was elucidated and hydrogen bonding was shown to {{play a critical role in}} enhancing the solid solubility. lndoprofen that hydrogen bonds to PVP had solid solubility of l 3...|$|E
40|$|Enantiomeric {{profiling}} of chiral pharmacologically active compounds (PACs) in {{the environment}} has hardly been investigated. This manuscript describes, for the first time, a multi-residue enantioselective method {{for the analysis of}} human and veterinary chiral PACs and their main metabolites from different therapeutic groups in complex environmental samples such as wastewater and river water. Several analytes targeted in this paper have not been analysed {{in the environment}} at enantiomeric level before. These are aminorex, carboxyibuprofen, carprofen, cephalexin, 3 -N-dechloroethylifosfamide, 10, 11 -dihydro- 10 -hydroxycarbamazepine, dihydroketoprofen, fenoprofen, fexofenadine, flurbiprofen, 2 -hydroxyibuprofen, ifosfamide, <b>indoprofen,</b> mandelic acid, 2 -phenylpropionic acid, praziquantel and tetramisole. The method is based on chiral liquid chromatography utilising a chiral α 1 -acid glycoprotein column and tandem mass spectrometry detection. Excellent chromatographic separation of enantiomers (Rs≥ 1. 0) was achieved for chloramphenicol, fexofenadine, ifosfamide, naproxen, tetramisole, ibuprofen and their metabolites: aminorex and dihydroketoprofen (three of four enantiomers), and partial separation (Rs = 0. 7 – 1. 0) was achieved for ketoprofen, praziquantel and the following metabolites: 3 -N-dechloroethylifosfamide and 10, 11 -dihydro- 10 -hydroxycarbamazepine. The overall performance of the method was satisfactory for most of the compounds targeted. Method detection limits were at low nanogram per litre for surface water and effluent wastewater. Method intra-day precision was on average under 20 % and sample pre-concentration using solid phase extraction yielded recoveries > 70 % for most of the analytes. This novel, selective and sensitive method has been applied for the quantification of chiral PACs in surface water and effluent wastewater providing excellent enantioresolution of multicomponent mixtures in complex environmental samples. It will help with better understanding of the role of individual enantiomers in the environment and will enable more accurate environmental risk assessment...|$|E

Modulated differential scanning calorimeter (MDSC) was used to determine the solid solubility of trehalose, griseofulvin, and <b>indoprofen,</b> in amorphous polymers like PVP and dextran. The solid dispersions of varying drug content were subjected to accelerated stability conditions and the extent of drug-carrier miscibility was analyzed by monitoring their Tgs. The mechanism of solid solubility and the influence of factors like storage temperature, moisture and the drug-carrier hydrogen bonding on the solid solubility have been examined. Also, the kinetic rate of drug phase separation from the polymer was estimated by fitting the Tg of miscible mixtures, to the first-order rate equation. ^ The effect of surfactants on the drug solid solubility in the polymer was also investigated. To probe into the factors responsible for physical instability of amorphous solid dispersions, the molecular mobility of a model drug-griseofulvin and the polymer-PVP was studied. Isothermal and non-isothermal crystallization studies were conducted on griseofulvin to determine the activation energy for crystallization. Molecular mobility of PVP was studied using thermally stimulated current spectroscopy and the factors influencing the molecular motions were studied. ...|$|E
