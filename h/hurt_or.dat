5|$|Mythology and {{folklore}} often {{exaggerate the}} skills of famous gunfighters. Most of these historical figures were not known {{to be capable of}} trick shooting, nor did they necessarily have a reputation for precision sharpshooting. Such tropes that are frequently seen in Westerns include shooting the center of a coin, stylistic pistol twirling, glancing shots that intentionally only graze an opponent (the bullet through the hat being an example), shooting an opponent's belt buckle (thus dropping his pants), a bullet cutting the hangman's rope, or shooting the guns out of opponents' hands (typically as an alternative to killing). The latter was debunked by Mythbusters as an impossibility, as unjacketed bullets tend to shatter into fragments that can <b>hurt</b> <b>or</b> even kill. Ed McGivern dispelled the myth of the inaccuracy of pistol fanning by shooting tight groups while fanning the revolver.|$|E
5|$|As Rosenbaum {{describes}} it, Lex views Lana as this beautiful, charming {{girl with}} a little naïveté. It is this naïveté that allows Lex {{to believe that he}} can trust and confide in Lana, and that she is his one true love. Lex also knows that Lana will always love Clark, but he expects her to love him for who he is just the same. Rosenbaum does not believe that Lana gives that to Lex. Writer Holly Harold finds parallels between Lex's relationship with Lana, and that of Lionel's relationship with Martha. Both men believe that these two women will be their saving grace, and pull them back from the dark side. In Lex's defense, Rosenbaum contends that Lex is not using Lana in an effort to hurt Clark, but that he really does love her. The actor believes that Lex's problem {{lies in the fact that}} every time he has loved someone and opened up to them he has been <b>hurt,</b> <b>or</b> betrayed. Even though Lex loves Lana more than anyone else before her, he just cannot bring himself to open up completely for fear of repeating the past. Rosenbaum believes that the eventual dissolution of the marriage between Lex and Lana was a tragic moment in both characters' lives. It is a moment that solidifies Lex's history of opening up to women and having them hurt him.|$|E
5|$|Bormann took a {{job with}} Der Nationalsozialist, a weekly paper edited by NSDAP member Hans Severus Ziegler, who was deputy Gauleiter (party leader) for Thuringia. After joining the NSDAP in 1927, Bormann began duties as {{regional}} press officer, but his lack of public-speaking skills made him ill-suited to this position. He soon put his organisational skills to use as business manager for the Gau (region). He moved to Munich in October 1928, where {{he worked in the}} SA insurance office. Initially the NSDAP provided coverage through insurance companies for members who were <b>hurt</b> <b>or</b> killed in the frequent violent skirmishes with members of other political parties. As insurance companies were unwilling to pay out claims for such activities, in 1930 Bormann set up the Hilfskasse der NSDAP (NSDAP Auxiliary Fund), a benefits and relief fund directly administered by the party. Each party member was required to pay premiums and might receive compensation for injuries sustained while conducting party business. Payments out of the fund were made solely at Bormann's discretion. He began to gain a reputation as a financial expert, and many party members felt personally indebted to him after receiving benefits from the fund. In addition to its stated purpose, the fund was used as a last-resort source of funding for the NSDAP, which was chronically short of money at the time. After the NSDAP's success in the 1930 general election, where they won 107 seats, party membership grew dramatically. By 1932 the fund was collecting 3 million Reichsmarks per year.|$|E

25|$|Ethical vegetarians {{say that}} the reasons for not <b>hurting</b> <b>or</b> killing animals {{are similar to the}} reasons for not <b>hurting</b> <b>or</b> killing humans. They argue that killing an animal, like killing a human, can only be {{justified}} in extreme circumstances; consuming a living creature just for its taste, for convenience, or out of habit is not justifiable. Some ethicists have added that humans, unlike other animals, are morally conscious of their behavior and have a choice; this is why there are laws governing human behavior, and why it is subject to moral standards.|$|R

25|$|Intentional acts {{of cruelty}} {{can lead to}} {{multiple}} years behind bars. These acts (of intentional animal cruelty or non-accidental injury) may be indicators of serious psychological problems. According to the American Humane Association, 13% of intentional animal abuse cases involve domestic violence. As many as 71% of pet-owning women seeking shelter at safe houses have reported that their partner had threatened and/or actually <b>hurt</b> <b>or</b> killed {{one or more of}} their pets; 32% of these women reported that one or more of their children had also <b>hurt</b> <b>or</b> killed pets. Battered women report that they are prevented from leaving their abusers because they fear {{what will happen to the}} animals in their absence. Animal abuse is sometimes used as a form of intimidation in domestic disputes.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, in Test and {{first-class}} cricket it {{is usually}} necessary for a side fielding last to have dismissed ten players of the opposing team in their final innings to achieve victory (unless {{one or more of}} the batsmen have retired <b>hurt</b> <b>or</b> absent and unable to take the field).|$|E

25|$|The now extinct Hare Indian dog of {{northern}} Canada {{was not known}} to bark in its native homeland, though puppies born in Europe learned how to imitate the barking of other dogs.

25|$|It {{has also}} been found that {{children}} who are cruel to animals have often witnessed or been victims of abuse themselves.

25|$|Law 25: Batsman's innings; Runners A batsman {{who becomes}} {{unable to run}} may have a runner, who completes the runs while the batsman {{continues}} batting.

25|$|Many urban legends are framed as {{complete}} stories with plot and characters. The compelling {{appeal of a}} typical urban legend is its elements of mystery, horror, fear or humor.

25|$|Aside {{from being}} a tool, the sonic {{screwdriver}} can be used and considered as a defensive weapon, which is effective for a few types of assault weapons, but not designed to kill or injure living things {{as the only way}} it can really <b>hurt</b> <b>or</b> incapacitate a creature is by emitting painful bursts of sound, or, as of Day of the Moon by blasting a green wave of energy to incapacitate a target, though only the Eleventh and Twelfth's sonic has been shown to do the latter.|$|E
25|$|Depictions of rats {{in fiction}} are {{historically}} inaccurate and negative. The most common falsehood is the squeaking almost always heard in otherwise realistic portrayals (i.e. nonanthropomorphic). While the recordings {{may be of}} actual squeaking rats, the noise is uncommon – they may do so only if distressed, <b>hurt,</b> <b>or</b> annoyed. Normal vocalizations are very high-pitched, well outside the range of human hearing. Rats are also often cast in vicious and aggressive roles when in fact, their shyness helps keep them undiscovered for so long in an infested home.|$|E
25|$|For instance, theft {{is defined}} in section 378 of the Code, and section 379 makes simple theft (or theft simpliciter) an offence {{punishable}} with imprisonment of {{up to three years}} or with fine or both. Section 379A punishes the theft of a motor vehicle or any component part of a motor vehicle with imprisonment of not less than one year and not more than seven years and a fine. Sections 380 and 381 respectively make it offences to commit theft in any building, tent or vessel which is used as a human dwelling or for the custody of property; and, while being a clerk or servant, or being employed in the capacity of a clerk or servant, to commit theft of any property in the possession of one's master or employer. In both cases the penalty is imprisonment of up to seven years and a fine. The most serious theft offence is that of committing theft, having made preparation for causing death or <b>hurt</b> <b>or</b> restraint, or fear of death or of <b>hurt</b> <b>or</b> of restraint, to any person in order to commit the theft, or in order to effect an escape after committing the theft, or in order to retain property taken by the theft. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for up to ten years and caning with not less than three strokes.|$|E

25|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket, a {{dismissal}} occurs when the batsman is out (also known as the fielding side taking a wicket and/or the batting side losing a wicket). At this point a batsman must discontinue batting and leave the field permanently for the innings. A bowling team dismisses (or bowls out) the entire batting team by dismissing 10 of the 11 players (assuming player(s) from the batting team have not retired <b>hurt</b> <b>or</b> are absent). As the players bat in pairs, when only one person is undismissed, {{it is not possible}} for them to bat any longer.|$|E
25|$|Although mice {{are small}} animals and {{care must be}} taken to avoid injury, they are also {{surprisingly}} robust and inquisitive. Once out of the cage many enjoy running along their owners' arms, investigating pockets, or just sitting on the owner's lap and grooming. Some mice also tolerate gentle petting. Care must be taken as mice have poor eyesight and may try to lean too far over an edge and fall. Care must especially be taken when being handled by small children as they may be overly rough. Fancy mice very rarely bite except when <b>hurt</b> <b>or</b> very frightened. Biting behavior may result from improper handling, as mice are generally considered non-aggressive. They do have a greater likelihood of biting unfamiliar people, especially males who are wild and territorial.|$|E
