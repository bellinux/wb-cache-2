40|$|Replication-incompetent {{recombinant}} retroviruses {{are currently}} used for gene delivery. The limited efficiency of gene transfer using these vectors hampers implementation of gene therapy. Successful integration of Moloney {{murine leukemia virus}} (MMuLV) -derived retroviral vectors into the host cell DNA requires cell division. The time difference between virus entry and cell division is variable and prolonged in slowly dividing cells. Therefore, the rate of intracellular decay of internalized vectors between the time of entry into the target cell and cell division may limit the probability of successful integration following viral entry. We present two methods that measure the intracellular stability of MMuLV-derived retroviral vectors in NIH 3 T 3 cells. The first {{is based on a}} temporary interruption of cell cycle progression by using cell detachment. This method provides an estimate, but not a direct measurement, of the half-life. The results show that the MMuLV <b>intracellular</b> <b>half-life</b> is on the order of but shorter than the total cell cycle time. The second method allows the direct measurement of the <b>intracellular</b> <b>half-life</b> by using two cell cycle-specific labels: 5 -bromodeoxyuridine, a thymidine analog that labels cells in S-phase; and the viral vector that labels cells in mitosis. By varying the time between the administration of the two labels, the <b>intracellular</b> <b>half-life</b> is measured to be in the range of 5. 5 to 7. 5 h. Such a short <b>intracellular</b> <b>half-life</b> may restrict the efficiency of gene transfer by retroviral vectors, particularly in slowly dividing target cells...|$|E

40|$|Small interfering RNA (siRNA) {{molecules}} are potent effectors of post-transcriptional gene silencing. Using noninvasive bioluminescent {{imaging and}} {{a mathematical model}} of siRNA delivery and function, the effects of target-specific and treatment-specific parameters on siRNA-mediated gene silencing are monitored in cells stably expressing the firefly luciferase protein. In vitro, luciferase protein levels recover to pre-treatment values within < 1 week in rapidly dividing cell lines, but take longer than 3 weeks to return to steady-state levels in nondividing fibroblasts. Similar results are observed in vivo, with knockdown lasting ~ 10 days in subcutaneous tumors in A/J mice and 3 – 4 weeks in the nondividing hepatocytes of BALB/c mice. These data indicate that dilution due to cell division, and not <b>intracellular</b> siRNA <b>half-life,</b> governs the duration of gene silencing under these conditions. To demonstrate the practical use of the model in treatment design, model calculations are used to predict the dosing schedule required to maintain persistent silencing of target proteins with different half-lives in rapidly dividing or nondividing cells. The approach of bioluminescent imaging combined with mathematical modeling provides useful insights into siRNA function and may help expedite the translation of siRNA into clinically relevant therapeutics for disease treatment and management...|$|R

A previous {{study showed that}} 11 poly-arginine fused p 53 protein (11 R-p 53) effectively penetrated across the plasma membrane and inhibited the proliferation of oral cancer cells. However, the <b>intracellular</b> <b>half-life</b> of the delivered protein was less than 36 h. Previous studies also showed that 2 -methoxyestradiol (2 -ME), an endogenous non-toxic estrogenic metabolite, induces the stabilization of the wild-type p 53 protein in human cancer cells posttranscriptionally. In the present study, we examined whether 2 -ME induced the stabilization of 11 R-p 53 and had an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of oral cancer cells. The application of 2 -ME significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of 11 R-p 53 on the proliferation of oral cancer cells. However, 2 -ME {{had no effect on}} the <b>intracellular</b> <b>half-life</b> of 11 R-p 53 in oral cancer cells. Of interest is the finding that 2 -ME suppressed the transcriptional activity of NFkappaB, which has an important role in tumorigenesis, but did not affect p 53 transcriptional activity.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{vertebrate}} segmentation, oscillatory {{activation of}} Notch signaling {{is important in}} the clock that regulates the timing of somitogenesis. In mice, the cyclic activation of NOTCH 1 requires the periodic expression of Lunatic fringe (Lfng). For LFNG {{to play a role in}} the segmentation clock, its cyclic transcription must be coupled with post-translational mechanisms that confer a short protein half-life. LFNG protein is cleaved and released into the extracellular space, and here we examine the hypothesis that this secretion contributes to a short LFNG <b>intracellular</b> <b>half-life,</b> facilitating rapid oscillations within the segmentation clock. We localize N-terminal protein sequences that control the secretory behavior of fringe proteins and find that LFNG processing is promoted by specific proprotein convertases including furin and SPC 6. Mutations that alter LFNG processing increase its <b>intracellular</b> <b>half-life</b> without preventing its secretion. These mutations do not affect the specificity of LFNG function in the Notch pathway, thus regulation of protein half-life affects the duration of LFNG activity without altering its function. Finally, the embryonic expression pattern of Spc 6 suggests a role in terminating LFNG activity during somite patterning. These results have important implications for the mechanisms that contribute to the tight control of Notch signaling during vertebrate segmentation...|$|E

However, one disadvantage of such therapy is the short <b>intracellular</b> <b>half-life</b> of the delivered protein. Here, we generated mutant proteins in which multiple lysine residues in the C-terminal were substituted by arginines. The mutant proteins were effectively delivered in glioma cells and were resistant to Mdm 2 -mediated ubiquitination. Moreover, the mutant proteins displayed higher transcription regulatory activity and powerful inhibition of the proliferation of glioma cells.

The effect of HR HPV 16 E 7 and LR HPV 6 E 7 on p 130 <b>intracellular</b> localization and <b>half-life</b> was examined.

The half-life of p 130, relative to control cells, was decreased in the cytoplasm in the presence of HPV 6 E 7 or HPV 16 E 7, but only decreased by HPV 6 E 7 in the nucleus. Inhibition of proteasomal degradation extended the half-life of p 130, regardless of intracellular localization.

40|$|The assembly, stability, {{and timely}} {{disassembly}} of short interfering RNA (siRNA) nanocomplexes {{have the potential}} to affect the efficiency of siRNA delivery and gene silencing. As such, the design of new probes that can measure these properties without significantly perturbing the nanocomplexes or their environment may facilitate the study and further development of new siRNA nanocomplexes. Herein, we study Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) -labeled siRNA probes that can track the assembly, stability, and disassembly of siRNA nanocomplexes in different environments. The probe is composed of two identical siRNAs, each labeled with a fluorophore. Upon nanocomplex formation, the siRNA-bound fluorophores become locally aggregated within the nanocomplex and undergo FRET. A key advantage of this technique is that the delivery vehicle (DV) need not be labeled, thus enabling the characterization of a large variety of nanocarriers, some of which may be difficult or even impossible to label. We demonstrate proof-of-concept by measuring the assembly of various DVs with siRNAs and show good agreement with gel electrophoresis experiments. As a consequence of not having to label the DV, we are able to determine nanocomplex biophysical parameters such as the extracellular apparent dissociation constants (KD) and <b>intracellular</b> disassembly <b>half-life</b> for several in-house and proprietary commercial DVs. Furthermore, the lack of DV modification allows for a true direct comparison between DVs as well as correlation between their biophysical properties and gene silencing.

The lower limits of quantitation for plasma and PBMC lysate raltegravir were 2 nmol/liter and 0. 225 nmol/liter, respectively. Noncompartmental analyses were performed using WinNonLin. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using NONMEM. Six male subjects were included in the study; their median weight was 67. 4 kg, and their median age was 33. 5 years.

HPVs are divided into high-risk (HR) or low-risk (LR) types based on their oncogenic potential. HPVs 16 and 18 are considered HR types and can cause cervical cancer. HPVs 6 and 11 are classified as LR and are associated with condyloma acuminata (genital warts). Viral proteins of both HR and LR HPVs must be able to facilitate a replication competent environment. The E 7 proteins of LR and HR HPVs are responsible for maintenance of S-phase activity in infected cells. HR E 7 proteins target all pRb family members (pRb, p 107 and p 130) for degradation. LR E 7 does not target pRb or p 107 for degradation, but does target p 130 for degradation. Immunohistochemistry experiments on HPV 6 infected patient biopsies of condyloma acuminata showed that detection of p 130 was decreased in the presence of the whole HPV 6 genome. Further, the effect of HR HPV 16 E 7 and LR HPV 6 E 7 on p 130 <b>intracellular</b> localization and <b>half-life</b> was examined.

40|$|Abacavir is a {{guanosine}} analog that competitively inhibits {{the reverse}} transcriptase {{of the human}} immunodefiency virus (HIV) and is used in combination antiretroviral therapy {{for the treatment of}} HIV. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1998 and has been in clinical use since that time. Abacavir is currently most commonly used as part of a fixed-dose combination, 600 mg in combination with lamivudine 300 mg which is given once-daily as part of combination antiretroviral therapy. It is also available as a liquid formulation and has been approved for use in children. Abacavir is well absorbed with an absolute bioavailability of 83 % and can be taken without regard to food [1]. Although the parent drug has a short plasma half-life of only 2 h, abacavir is metabolized to carbovir triphosphate which has an <b>intracellular</b> <b>half-life</b> of 20 h or longer [1, 2]. It is this long <b>intracellular</b> <b>half-life</b> of carbovir triphosphate that makes abacavir pharmacokinetically amenable to once-daily dosing and this has been supported by clinical data [3, 4]. Unlike other nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors, abacavir is metabolized predominantly by the liver by two major pathways: alcohol dehydrogenase and uridine diphosphate glucruonyltransferase. Less than 2 % is excreted unchanged in the urine [1]. In addition, unlike other antiretroviral drugs that are metabolized by the liver such as nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors, abacavir is not significantly metabolized by cytochrome (CYP) P 450 enzymes. It also does not inhibit or induce CYP enzymes which make drug interactions unlikely. Therapeutic drug monitoring has been infrequently employed for abacavir as it is the intracellular concentrations of carbovir triphosphate which would be most likely to be associated with drug effect and these are difficult and costly to measure on a routine basis. There is also very little information on validated intracellular target concentrations and their association with clinical efficacy...|$|E

Following chase incubations, the major oligosaccharide accumulating intracellularly was Man 6 GIcNAc 2, which was shown to contain a single al, 2 -linked mannose residue. Conversion of Man 6 GIcNAc 2 to complex-type oligosaccharides occurred {{at the time of}} secretion since appreciable amounts of Man SGIcNAC 2 or further processed structures could not be detected intracellularly. The subcellular locations of the al, 2 -mannosidase activities were studied using carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and monensin. Despite inhibiting the secretion of IgA, these inhibitors of protein migration did not effect the initial {{processing of}} Man 9 GIcNAc 2 to Man 6 GIcNAc 2. Furthermore, no large accumulation of Man SGIcNAC 2 occurred, indicatin...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} evaluate a novel method of controlling protein expression by repeatedly transfecting cells with in vitro-transcribed RNA. Transcripts encoding six factors, each known {{to play an important}} role in cell-type specification and maintenance, were designed and synthesized. Aspects of the design were optimized, and the intracellular stability and translation efficiency of the ivT RNA were quantified. Transcripts were delivered to cells by electroporation, and a method of increasing the rate at which cells recover from ivT-RNA transfection by combined knockdown of innate-immune-related genes was developed. Using this technique a high, approximately steady-state level of protein expression was transduced in MRC- 5 human fetal-lung fibroblasts by repeated transfection with capped, poly(A) + ivT RNA encoding a protein with an <b>intracellular</b> <b>half-life</b> of approximately three days. Transfection at 24 -hour intervals with ivT RNA encoding a less stable protein resulted in protein expression that peaked twelve hours after each transfection, and diminished before the next transfection. In both cases, cells sustained a high rate of proliferation. In this study, extended transient transfection by repeated delivery of ivT RNA was shown to transduc...|$|E
40|$|The viral {{integrase}} enzyme has recently {{emerged as a}} primary alternative target to block HIV- 1 replication, and integrase inhibitors are considered a pivotal new class of antiretroviral drugs. Dolutegravir is an investigational next-generation integrase inhibitor showing some novel and intriguing characteristics, ie, it has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with a prolonged <b>intracellular</b> <b>half-life,</b> rendering feasible once-daily dosing {{without the need for}} ritonavir boosting and without regard to meals. Moreover, dolutegravir is primarily metabolized via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltranferase 1 A 1, with a minor component of the cytochrome P 450 3 A 4 isoform, thereby limiting drug-drug interactions. Furthermore, its metabolic profile enables coadministration with most of the other available antiretroviral agents without dose adjustment. Recent findings also demonstrate that dolutegravir has significant activity against HIV- 1 isolates with resistance mutations associated with raltegravir and/or elvitegravir. The attributes of once-daily administration and the potential to treat integrase inhibitor-resistant viruses make dolutegravir an interesting and promising investigational drug. In this review, the main concerns about the efficacy and safety of dolutegravir as well as its resistance profile are explored by analysis of currently available data from preclinical and clinical studies...|$|E
40|$|The EJ bladder {{carcinoma}} oncogene {{is activated}} by a point mutation in the c-rasH proto-oncogene at the 12 th amino acid codon. In {{an attempt to}} understand the mechanism of oncogenic activation, a comparative study was undertaken to examine the metabolic turnover and subcellular localization of the p 21 protein encoded by the EJ oncogene, the viral oncogene, and its normal cellular homolog. Pulse-labeling experiments indicated that both c-ras p 21 proteins were synthesized by a very similar pathway, as was observed for the viral p 21 protein of Harvey murine sarcoma virus. The pro-p 21 proteins were detected in free cytosol, and the processed products were associated with plasma membrane. The <b>intracellular</b> <b>half-life</b> of p 21 proteins was determined by pulse-labeling and chasing {{in the presence of}} excess unlabeled methionine. Although both p 21 proteins of EJ and the normal c-ras genes which are not phosphorylated have a half-life of 20 h, the viral p 21 protein of Harvey murine sarcoma virus which includes a phosphorylated form is much more stable in cells, having a half-life of 42 h, apparently due to phosphorylation...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} deamination, cytotoxicity, {{cellular}} drug uptake, distribution and cellular pharmacology in HL- 60 cells of N 4 -hexadecyl- 1 -beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (NHAC), a lipophilic derivative of arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C), were studied. Compared with ara-C, NHAC in liposomal formulations was highly resistant to deamination, resulting {{in levels of}} formation of arabinofuranosyluracil 42 and ten times lower in plasma and liver microsomes respectively. The cytotoxicity of NHAC was independent of both the nucleoside transporter mechanism and the deoxycytidine (dCyd) kinase activity as demonstrated by co-incubating NHAC with dipyridamole and/or dCyd. In ara C-resistant HL- 60 cells NHAC was still cytotoxic, requiring drug concentration only 1. 6 times higher than sensitive cells. Uptake of NHAC was six times higher and was not inhibited by dipyridamole. The pharmacokinetics of NHAC revealed that its <b>intracellular</b> <b>half-life</b> is 4. 8 times longer than that of ara-C. Ara-CTP formation and incorporation into DNA was up to 25 - 50 times {{lower than that of}} ara-C and contributed only marginally to the cytotoxic effects of NHAC. These results indicate that, because of the significantly increased stability, the transporter-independent uptake and the dCyd-kinase-independent cytotoxicity, NHAC might be active in ara-C-resistant cells...|$|E
40|$|A tetracycline-regulated {{system was}} used to {{generate}} cell lines allowing tightly controlled expression of a hepatitis C virus (HCV) cDNA comprising the 5 ' noncoding, the core, {{and part of the}} E 1 regions. Production of 21 -kDa processed nucleocapsid protein could be regulated over a broad range by the concentration of tetracycline present in the culture medium. Induction ratios of over 1, 000 -fold were found using an HCV core-luciferase fusion construct. Core protein had an <b>intracellular</b> <b>half-life</b> of 9 hr and corresponded to the product of 173 amino-terminal amino acids of the HCV open reading frame. Sequential immunofluorescence microscopy revealed the presence of core antigen first in a predominantly perinuclear fine-reticular staining pattern and subsequently also in cytoplasmic granules and vesicles. By immunoelectron microscopy core protein was found on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and on the surface of cytoplasmic lipid droplets. Growth rate analyses and colony formation efficiency assays showed no major cytotoxic effect of HCV core protein expression per se. HCV gene expression could be inhibited by an antisense oligonucleotide targeting a region immediately downstream of the translation initiation codon. These cell lines represent important tools to investigate structural and functional properties of HCV core protein and may be useful to evaluate gene therapeutic strategies against HCV in a cellular system...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The binding and {{subsequent}} intracellular processing of transferrin and transferrin receptors was studied in A 431 cells using ~ 2 h-transferrin and a monoclonal antibody to the receptor (ATR) labeled with 1251 and gold colloid. Using 1251 -transferrin {{we have shown}} that, whereas at 37 °C uptake proceeded linearly for up to 60 min, most of the ligand that was bound was internalized and then rapidly returned to the incubation medium undegraded. At 37 °C, the <b>intracellular</b> <b>half-life</b> of the most rapidly recycled transferrin was 7. 5 min. 1251 -ATR displayed the same kinetics of uptake but following its internalization at 37 °C, it was partially degraded. At 22 °C and below, the intracellular degradation of ~ 251 -ATR was selectively inhibited {{and as a result}} it accumulated intracellularly. Electron microscopy of conventional thin sections and of whole-cell mounts was used to follow the uptake and processing of transferrin receptors labeled with ATR-gold colloid complexes. Using a pulse-chase protocol, the intracellular pathway followed by internalized ATR gold-receptor complexes was outlined in detail. Within 5 min at 22 °C the internalized complexes were transferred from coated pits on the cell surface to a system of narrow, branching cisternae within the peripheral cytoplasm. By 15 min they reached larger, mor...|$|E
40|$|Antisense and triplex oligonucleotides {{continue}} to demonstrate potential as mediators of gene-specific repression of protein synthesis. However, inefficient and heterogeneous cellular uptake, intracellular sequestration, and rapid intracellular and extracellular degradation represent obstacles to their eventual clinical utility. Efficient cellular delivery of targeted ribozymes can present similar problems. In this report we describe {{a system for}} circumventing these obstacles and producing large quantities of short, sequence-specific RNA oligonucleotides for use in these gene regulation strategies. The oligonucleotides are generated from a vector containing promoter, capping, and termination sequences from the human small nuclear U 6 gene, surrounding a synthetic sequence incorporating the oligonucleotide of interest. In vivo, these oligonucleotides are produced constitutively and without cell type specificity in levels up to 5 x 10 (6) copies per cell, reach steady-state levels of expression within 9 hours post-transfection, and are still readily detectable 7 days post-transfection. In addition, these oligonucleotides are retained in the nucleus, obtain a 5 ' gamma-monomethyl phosphate cap, and have an <b>intracellular</b> <b>half-life</b> of approximately one hour. This expression vector provides a novel and efficient method of intracellular delivery of antisense or triplex RNA oligonucleotides (and/or ribozymes) for gene regulation, {{as well as a}} cost-effective means of comparing the biological activity arising from a variety of different potential oligonucleotide sequences...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to immunocharacterize Bovine Ocular Squamous Cell Carcinoma {{neoplastic}} cells, in terms of proliferation index and DNA damage, using two human primary antibodies anti- Ki 67 antigen of the cell cycle and anti- p 53. Ki 67 is a nuclear antigen expressed in dividing cells during late G 1, G 2, S-phase and M-phase that disapears rapidly after mitosis. p 53 is a tumor supressor protein that plays a key role in the control of the DNA damage acting as a supressor of tumour cell proliferation, enhancing genetic stability. Mutation of the gene that codes for p 53 provides an extended <b>intracellular</b> <b>half-life</b> of the protein and greater stability, therefore increasing its expression. Tumours for this study were obtained at the slautherhouse, in Ponta Delgada, Azores. A total of thirty samples were colected from eighteen bovine. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed in parafin embeded sections of formalin fixed material, using the Avidin-Biotin-Peroxidase method (ABC). Primary antibodies used were anti-human p 53 (NCL – p 53 CM- 1, NOVOCASTRA, UK) and anti-human Ki 67 (NCL – Ki 67 p, NOVOCASTRA, UK), both policlonal. Positivity for both Ki 67 and p 53 was evaluated quantitatively and semi-quantitatively, respectively...|$|E
40|$|See the Editorial Commentary by Kuritzkes et al, {{on pages}} 876 – 7.) We {{systematically}} reviewed {{studies of the}} virological efficacy of the 4 new tenofovir (TDF) -containing regimens recommended for initial antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in the 2010 World Health Organization ARV Treatment Guidelines. Thirty-three studies assessed the efficacy of 1 or more TDF-containing regimens: TDF/ lamivudine (3 TC) /nevirapine (NVP) (n 5 3), TDF / emtricitabine (FTC) /NVP (n 5 9), TDF/ 3 TC/efavirenz (EFV) (n 5 6), and TDF/FTC/EFV (n 5 19). TDF/ 3 TC/NVP was the least well-studied and appeared the least efficacious of the 4 regimens. In 2 comparative studies, TDF/ 3 TC/NVP was associated with significantly more virological failure than AZT/ 3 TC/NVP; a third study was terminated prematurely because of early virological failure. TDF/FTC/NVP was either equivalent or inferior to its comparator arms. TDF/ 3 TC/EFV was equivalent to its comparator arms. TDF/FTC/EFV was equivalent or superior to its comparator arms. Possible explanations for these findings include the greater antiviral activity of EFV versus NVP and longer <b>intracellular</b> <b>half-life</b> of FTC-triphosphate versus 3 TC-triphosphate. Further study of TDF/ 3 TC/NVP is required before it is widely deployed for initial ARV therapy. The initial antiretroviral (ARV) regimens used by most national treatment programs in resource-limited setting...|$|E
