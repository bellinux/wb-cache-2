50|$|The aditus to mastoid antrum (otomastoid foramen or {{entrance}} or aperture to the mastoid antrum) {{is a large}} irregular cavity {{that leads}} backward from the <b>epitympanic</b> <b>recess</b> into a considerable air space named the tympanic or mastoid antrum.|$|E
50|$|The mastoid antrum (tympanic antrum, antrum mastoideum, Valsalva's antrum) is an {{air space}} in the petrous portion of the {{temporal}} bone, communicating posteriorly with the mastoid cells and anteriorly with the <b>epitympanic</b> <b>recess</b> {{of the middle ear}} via the aditus to mastoid antrum (entrance to the mastoid antrum). These air spaces function as sound receptors, provide voice resonance, act as acoustic insulation and dissipation, provide protection from physical damage and reduce the mass of the cranium.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to these a large irregular cavity is situated at the upper and front part of the bone. It is called the tympanic antrum, and must be distinguished from the mastoid cells, though it communicates with them. Like the mastoid cells {{it is filled with}} air and lined by a prolongation of the mucous membrane of the tympanic cavity, with which it communicates. The tympanic antrum is bounded above by a thin plate of bone, the tegmen tympani, which separates it from the middle fossa of the base of the skull; below by the mastoid process; laterally by the squama just below the temporal line, and medially by the lateral semicircular canal of the internal ear which projects into its cavity. It opens in front into that portion of the tympanic cavity which is known as the attic or <b>epitympanic</b> <b>recess.</b> The tympanic antrum is a cavity of some considerable size at the time of birth; the mastoid air cells may be regarded as diverticula from the antrum, and begin to appear at or before birth; by the fifth year they are well-marked, but their development is not completed until toward puberty.|$|E
40|$|The {{anterior}} <b>epitympanic</b> <b>recess</b> {{has received}} the supratubal recess, is the small space in the epitympanum anterior to the malleus. It is parti-tioned from the epitympanum proper (attic) by a coronally oriented bony septum, the anterior attic bony plate or “cog, ” which is suspended from the anterior petrosal tegmen (1, 2). It is bordered medially by the geniculate fossa and the anterior portion of the tympanic facial nerve ca-nal, and laterally by the petrosquamosal suture (3). The anterior <b>epitympanic</b> <b>recess</b> is partitioned in varying degrees in some temporal bones from the protympanum by a horizontal mucosal fold {{at the level of}} the tensor tympani muscle, or in others from the epitympanic space proper by a vertical fold attached to the cog (3 – 5). scant attention in the radiologic literature (6 – 8). Recent advances in surgical techniques of the middle ear cleft has spawned renewed inter-est in the microanatomy of the middle ear (3, 4). The anterior <b>epitympanic</b> <b>recess</b> has also attracted the attention of ear surgeons because of its relationship to important surrounding structures and to its frequent involvement by cholesteatoma (1, 4, 9, 10). In this article, we describe the variations in size and shape that this space may adopt on axial computed tomo-graphic (CT) scans, illustrate its radiologic anatomy, and describe the pathologic pro-cesses that may affect its appearance. Materials and Methods We retrospectively reviewed the axial CT scans of the temporal bone in 50 patients examined for vestibuloco-chlear symptoms. The patients ranged in age from 6 months to 80 years; 29 were female and 21 male. All patients were scanned on a GE (Milwaukee, Wis) 9800 CT scanner. The scanning protocol included 1. 5 -mm-thick sections at 1 -mm intervals obtained at the 130 ° plane...|$|E

40|$|The ear ossicles, {{preserved}} in skulls {{of a tiny}} Late Cretaceous multituberculate Chulsanbaatar vulgaris from Mongolia are arranged as in modem mammals. This makes {{the idea of an}} independent origin of the multituberculates from other mammals unlikely. We report the finding of ear ossicles in Mesozoic multituber-culates. Three almost complete incudes and two fragments of malleus are de-scribed and compared with those reported in the Paleocene Lambdopsalis and in non-multituberculate mammals. In these Late Cretaceous multituberculates lat-eral expansion of the braincase is associated with the presence of sinuses and development of extensive masticatory musculature, but not by the expansion of the vestibule, which is moderately developed. It is argued that because of the lateral expansion of the multituberculate braincase, the promontorium is ar-ranged slightly more obliquely with respect to the sagittal plane than in other mammals and the fenestra vestibuli faces anterolaterally, rather than laterally. This results in a corresponding alteration in orientation of the stapes. The <b>epitympanic</b> <b>recess</b> is situated more anteriorly with respect to the fenestr...|$|E
40|$|The {{significance}} and phylogenetic {{position of the}} rodent subfamily Reithroparamyinae is con-troversial. This taxon has been included variously in Ischyromyidae (Paramyidae, infraorder Protro-gomorpha) or in the infraorder Franimorpha. Its placement in the Franimorpha {{was based on an}} interpretation of the mandible as incipiently hys-tricognathous; reithroparamyines were therefore regarded by some workers as {{at least part of the}} ancestral stock of the Hystricognathi. Others con-sidered the Reithroparamyinae to be the most primitive ischyromyids, giving rise to later North American forms. Reithroparamys delicatissimus discussed herein presents several derived features of the auditory region. These include: (1) inflated bullae with internal septa, (2) apparent loss of the promontory artery, (3) the internal carotid artery crossing over the fenestra rotunda, (4) the presence of a meato-cochlear bridge, (5) a somewhat swol-len promontorium, (6) bony tube for the stapedial artery and facial nerve partially formed, (7) fe-nestra ovalis large and tilted, and (8) <b>epitympanic</b> <b>recess</b> dorsally expanded. Analysis of these de-rived characters allows the ancestor-descendant relationship between reithroparamyines and hys-tricognathous rodents to be rejected. For the same reason, Reithroparamyines do not represent the most primitive ischyromyids; instead, a close re-lationship of reithroparamyines with sciurids, aplodontids, and glirids is proposed...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS:Although {{middle ear}} {{aeration}} is certainly related to eustachian tube (ET) function, other anatomic factors may {{play an important}} role in ventilation of these spaces, particularly the epitympanum. STUDY DESIGN:A prospective case series study group with retrospective case series comparison. METHODS:Eight patients affected by non-self-cleaning attic retraction pockets or attic cholesteatoma of the middle ear and normal tubal function (verified by type A tympanogram or Williams' test) underwent endoscopic surgery. Anatomic findings were noted and collected, with particular attention paid to middle ear folds. A control group was used for comparison. The prevalence of an isthmus blockage with a complete tensor fold in pathologic ears was compared between the study group and control group. RESULTS:The higher prevalence of an isthmus blockage associated with a complete tensor fold in the study group was found to be statistically significant (P =. 001). CONCLUSIONS:A selective epitympanic dysventilation syndrome is hypothesized; normal ET function seems to be insufficient for complete ventilation of the middle ear, and an open tympanic isthmus or an incomplete tensor fold may be necessary for <b>epitympanic</b> <b>recess</b> ventilation. The selective epitympanic dysventilation syndrome would consist of the contemporary presence of the following four conditions: attic retraction pocket or cholesteatoma, normal tubal function tests, complete epitympanic diaphragm, and isthmus blockage...|$|E
