5|$|In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle, Herodotus {{says that}} the Persian fleet sailed around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly.

5|$|Although {{the market}} {{continued}} to operate, in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plague {{it was at}} a much reduced level and many stalls were left empty for some years after. The famine of 1369 overwhelmed Norwich's burial grounds, necessitating an expansion of St Peter Mancroft's churchyard. The southernmost rows of stalls in the main marketplace, which had been occupied by drapers and linen merchants, were removed to clear space for an enlarged churchyard. By 1377, the population of Norwich had fallen from at least 20,000 before the outbreak to below 6,000.|$|E

5|$|During September25–26, {{large-scale}} evacuations {{took place}} in response to forecasts suggesting a landfall near New Orleans. More than 1.5million people in New Orleans were advised to leave the city. The nine shelters opened throughout the area were collectively capable of accommodating up to 450,000 people. New Orleans mayor Marc Morial declared a State of Emergency to allow federal assistance into the affected areas during the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hurricane.

5|$|In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executions, {{there was}} {{speculation}} {{that up to}} 27 more prisoners could face the death penalty. Ultimately, these predictions proved ill-founded. Franco fell ill in late October 1975 and never recovered, dying on 20 November 1975. His death resulted in the de facto abolition of the death penalty, as no further executions took place. Capital punishment was abolished for all civil crimes by the Spanish Constitution of 1978, with sanctioned military executions in war time the sole exceptions. In 1995, the Spanish parliament abolished {{the death penalty in}} all circumstances.|$|E
5|$|The defences of Saborsko {{were first}} {{breached}} at noon, and the attacking force reached {{the centre of}} the village at 3:30p.m. According to SAO Krajina sources, resistance was light, with the defending force estimated to consist of only 150 armed troops. The village was secured by 5p.m. with tanks attached to the attacking force withdrawn by 6p.m. The assault resulted in the death of 50 Croatian troops, while the attacking forces suffered only four wounded. In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fighting to control Saborsko, the village was looted and many houses were torched.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} minor actions {{followed}} as the Australians continued their advance up the Milford Highway. After {{a month of}} fighting, the island was largely secured and following the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August 1945, the Japanese sued for peace and hostilities came to an end. During the fighting in Borneo the 2/33rd had lost 25 dead and 57 wounded. In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, the Australians remained on Borneo as an occupation force, while the Army was slowly demobilised. During this time the battalion was steadily reduced as personnel were repatriated to Australia for discharge, or were transferred to other units for further service, including providing personnel to the 34th Brigade, which was raised for occupation duties in Japan.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Pola, Tegetthoff kept his fleet {{in the northern}} Adriatic, where it patrolled against a possible Italian attack. The Italian ships never came, and on 12 August, the two countries signed the Armistice of Cormons; this ended the fighting {{and led to the}} Treaty of Vienna. Though Austria had defeated Italy at Lissa and on land at the Battle of Custoza, the Austrian army was decisively defeated by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz. As a result, Austria, which became Austria-Hungary in the Ausgleich of 1867, was forced to cede the city of Venice to Italy. In the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, the bulk of the Austrian fleet was decommissioned and disarmed.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, {{the bulk}} of the {{civilian}} population and the remaining Croatian police and troops fled over snow-covered terrain in poor weather to Karlovac, Ogulin, and to the nearby territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Approximately 30–60 civilians, largely elderly people, remained in Saborsko. The JNA and SAO Krajina troops forced those who remained behind to leave the village, killing or abusing the civilians. At least 25 civilians were murdered by the troops in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capture of Saborsko. Some of the victims were shot, while others were beaten or burned to death.|$|E
50|$|The first anti-lynching {{movement}} {{was characterized by}} black convention meets, which were organized in <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> individual incidents. <b>The</b> movement gained wider national support in the 1890's.

50|$|The ALPAC {{report was}} as {{influential}} as the Georgetown experiment {{had been a}} decade earlier; in <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> its publication, <b>the</b> US government suspended almost all funding for machine translation research.

5|$|After the war ended, {{the fort}} {{remained}} standing into the 1840s; in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war's conclusion {{the site was}} occupied by two squatters. In 1847 George Bainbridge purchased {{the land and the}} fort from the United States federal government. Bainbridge salvaged what logs were usable from the fort, dismantling it in the process, and used them to construct a barn on his property. The fort site remained relatively undisturbed in the ensuing years. In 1994 the non-profit Apple River Historical Foundation was organized and archaeological investigation was conducted in 1995. In June 1997 a reconstruction effort ended, and today a replica of the fort stands to the south of the original site, which remains undisturbed to preserve its archaeological integrity.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, demand for pennies was falling in Britain, {{likely due to}} the {{popularity}} of the lighter, more convenient, brass threepence coin. which weighed {{less than a quarter of}} the same value in bronze coins. The <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war had seen a strong demand for pennies until January 1949, when it dropped off, and in May of that year, the Royal Mint stopped the coin's production. Officials concluded that the fall in demand was permanent due to inflation; its purchasing power was minimal, and many automatic machines no longer took it. The Royal Mint redeemed surplus coppers from the banks for melting beginning in 1951, and by the end of the decade, some £1.2 million worth had been removed from circulation.|$|E
5|$|During the 820s, the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire had {{suffered}} two great losses that destroyed their naval supremacy in the Mediterranean: {{the beginning of}} the Muslim conquest of Sicily and the fall of Crete to Andalusian exiles. These losses ushered in an era where Saracen pirates raided the Christian northern shores of the Mediterranean almost at will. The establishment of the Emirate of Crete, which became a haven for Muslim ships, opened the Aegean Sea up for raids, while their—albeit partial—control of Sicily allowed the Arabs to raid and even settle in Italy and the Adriatic shores. Several Byzantine attempts to retake Crete in the <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Andalusian conquest, as well as a large-scale invasion in 842/43, failed with heavy losses.|$|E
50|$|On January 9, 1863, in <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> Stones River, <b>the</b> XIV Corps wings {{were given}} their own {{official}} corps designations. McCook's Right Wing became the XX Corps. Crittenden's Left Wing became the XXI Corps. Thomas' Center Wing remained as the XIV Corps.

30|$|Intermodal {{transportation}} can be {{a solution}} when transportation resources are scarce during <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>aftermath</b> <b>of</b> a disaster. <b>The</b> quantity <b>of</b> demand is usually high and required lead time is almost zero. Alternative transportation modes such as rail can carry relief supplies in higher amounts on a single trip as a cure for fleet size constraints of road transportation in the short term.
