40|$|Abstract. A non-binary Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) can {{be solved}} by {{converting}} the problem into an <b>equivalent</b> <b>binary</b> one and ap-plying well-established binary CSP techniques. An alternative way is to use extended versions of binary techniques directly in the non-binary problem. There are two well-known methods in the literature for trans-lating a non-binary CSP to an <b>equivalent</b> <b>binary</b> one; the hidden variable encoding and the dual encoding. It {{has been shown that}} arc consistency can be applied in the hidden variable encoding of a non-binary CSP with the same worst-case time complexity as generalized arc consistency in the non-binary representation. However, arc consistency in the dual encoding is so far considered prohibitively expensive to apply. In this pa-per we describe an arc consistency algorithm for the dual encoding with O(e 3 dk) worst-case complexity. This gives an O(dk/e) saving compared to a generic algorithm and is close to the complexity of generalized arc consistency in the non-binary representation. Preliminary experimental results show that the new algorithm can be orders of magnitude better than an optimal generic arc consistency algorithm. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – We {{propose a}} method to analyze files to {{categorize}} their type using efficient 1 -gram analysis of their <b>binary</b> <b>contents.</b> Our aim {{is to be able}} to accurately identify the true type of an arbitrary file using statistical analysis of their <b>binary</b> <b>contents</b> without parsing. Consequently, we may determine the type of a file if its name does not announce its true type. The method represents each file type by a compact representation we call a fileprint, effectively a simple means of representing all members of the same file type by a set of statistical 1 -gram models. The method is designed to be highly efficient so that files can be inspected with little or no buffering, and on a network appliance operating in high bandwidth environment or when streaming the file from or to disk.
