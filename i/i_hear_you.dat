25|$|In a dark, private lair in a tower {{high above}} the park, the Phantom (now {{revealed}} as Phantasma's owner and mastermind) interacts with an automaton that resembles Christine ("The Aerie"). In spite of the years that have passed and his many successes, the Phantom still longs {{to be reunited with}} her ("Til <b>I</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>You</b> Sing"). Meg intrudes and presses the Phantom for feedback on her performance, but he is distracted by his thoughts of Christine and dismisses Meg as an annoyance. Madame Giry is irritated that the Phantom still seems to think only of Christine after all that she and Meg have done for him over the years. Giry recounts how she and Meg helped smuggle him out of Paris and to a ship departing from Calais, on which they escaped to America. Ignoring her, the Phantom summons Miss Fleck, who appears with two other freak show performers, Dr. Gangle and Mr. Squelch. The Phantom has them dispatch a letter to Christine, inviting her to come and perform at Phantasma ("Giry confronts The Phantom/Til' <b>I</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>You</b> Sing (Reprise)").|$|E
500|$|In 1963, Sinatra {{reunited with}} Nelson Riddle for The Concert Sinatra, an ambitious album {{featuring}} a 73-piece symphony orchestra arranged and conducted by Riddle. The concert was recorded on a motion picture scoring soundstage {{with the use}} of multiple synchronized recording machines that employed an optical signal onto 35mm film designed for movie soundtracks. Granata considers the album to have been [...] "impeachable" [...] , [...] "one of the very best of the Sinatra-Riddle ballad albums", in which Sinatra displayed an impressive vocal range, particularly in [...] "Ol' Man River", in which he darkened the hue. [...] In 1964 the song [...] "My Kind of Town" [...] was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Sinatra released Softly, as I Leave You, and collaborated with Bing Crosby and Fred Waring on America, <b>I</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>You</b> Singing, a collection of patriotic songs recorded as a tribute to the assassinated President John F. Kennedy. Sinatra increasingly became involved in charitable pursuits in this period. In 1961 and 1962 he went to Mexico, with the sole purpose of putting on performances for Mexican charities, and in July 1964 he was present for the dedication of the Frank Sinatra International Youth Center for Arab and Jewish children in Nazareth.|$|E

2500|$|The {{architect}} was Ralph Symons, and in 1588 the {{new building}} was opened with a dedication festival, which Mildmay attended. He installed in the college a master, Laurence Chaderton, three fellows, and four scholars; but subsequent benefactions soon increased the fellowships to fourteen and the scholarships to fifty. According to Fuller, Mildmay, on coming to court, after the college was opened was addressed by the Queen with the words: [...] "Sir Walter, <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>you</b> have erected a puritan foundation", to which Mildmay replied: [...] "No, madam; far be it from me to countenance anything contrary to your established laws; but I have set an acorn, which when it becomes an oak, God alone knows {{what will be the}} fruit thereof".|$|E

After the Phantom pines for Christine and ascends to the gods (’Til <b>I</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>You</b> Sing), the scene breaks into an elaborate circus (Coney Island Waltz). Introduced by a trio of freaks, the amusement swells into a crowd of acrobats and stilt-walkers, fire-twirlers and magicians, with Luna Park-like plastic heads, a portable big-top, and rows of carnies singing from rollercoaster tracks suspended mid-air. It's breathtaking stuff, and not the best of Love Never Dies dark illusionism. That honor belongs to a scene, deeper into Coney, where transparent obelisks caging eldritch wonders—including a gilded mermaid—rotate across the stage." ...|$|E

2500|$|German First Lieutenant Paul Jürgen Vollmer, {{commander}} of the First Battalion, 120th Landwehr Infantry, emptied his pistol trying to kill York while he was contending with the machine guns. Failing to injure York, and seeing his mounting losses, he offered in English to surrender the unit to York, who accepted. By {{the end of the}} engagement, York and his seven men marched 132 German prisoners back to the American lines. [...] Upon returning to his unit, York reported to his brigade commander, Brigadier General Julian Robert Lindsey, who remarked [...] "Well York, <b>I</b> <b>hear</b> <b>you</b> have captured the whole damn German army." [...] York replied [...] "No sir. [...] I got only 132." [...] His actions silenced the German machine guns and were responsible for enabling the 328th Infantry to renew its attack to capture the Decauville Railroad.|$|E
2500|$|Ten {{years after}} the events at the Paris Opera, the Phantom is now a well known tycoon, being the mastermind of Phantasma, a Coney Island {{amusement}} park.

At Phantasma, The Phantom's performers Dr. Gangle, Miss Fleck and Mr. Squelch introduce the wonders of Coney Island ("The Coney Island Waltz"). Meg Giry, Christine Daaé's friend from the Paris Opera, has become [...] "The Ooh La La" [...] Girl in The Phantom's vaudeville show, which Madame Giry produces. Meg and the Phantasma cast win the crowd over with their performance of ("Only for You"). Madame Giry has read in the newspaper that Christine is coming to New York to sing for Oscar Hammerstein at the opening of his new Manhattan opera house. [...] Madame Giry is concerned that her daughter has lost the attention of the Phantom and she reminisces about how she and Meg smuggled him from Paris, France to New York City ten years ago.
