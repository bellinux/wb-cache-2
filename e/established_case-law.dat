50|$|Despite {{the initial}} scope of {{revision}} being ‘technical reform’, the 1992 BW enacted substantive modifications {{to both the}} prior Code and <b>established</b> <b>case-law.</b> The technical focus of the revised code is borrowed from the German BGB. The distinction between civil law and commercial law was done away with and brought under the broader ambit of private law. The Code now covers all aspects of commercial regulation—company, insurance, transport, consumer, and labour laws. For example, the 1992 Code now specifically regulates commercial contracts (Book 6, art. 119(a)). An unjust enrichment action is available (Book 6, art. 212), as are rescissory actions for vitiated consent or an ‘abuse of circumstances’ (Book 6, art. 44(4)). More generally, requirements of good faith now {{appear to be a}} constant theme throughout the Code: Book 6, art. 1 provides that both parties in a relationship are to behave equitably and reasonably towards each other. This appears to extend beyond contracts into other areas of law. The 1992 Code is more technical, systematic, and abstract than its predecessor. It is also more conceptual, providing for many well-defined principles at differing levels of abstraction. Throughout, the Code lays out a strict pattern of general rules upon which are built detailed ones. For example, tortious liability is founded on a general concept of an unlawful civil wrong. The concept will have differing applications in different circumstances. The Code is also more nuanced, providing for degree and qualification where an ‘all or nothing’ approach may have prevailed under the prior Code. The Code also loosens the legal positivism of the French system in favour of granting courts wider discretion in adjudicating cases. This discretion permits ‘intermediate solutions’ (i.e., not slavishly statutory) to complex problems.|$|E

Although this theoretical school originated in the common law system, which is still its realm, the thesis shows potential overlaps to the system of civil law. Questions concerning civil liability for damages are examined {{as an example of}} a possible application. The initial chapter of the thesis is concerned with introducing the economic analysis of law. At first, it briefly describes its historical development including links to some related schools. Foundations, areas of resesarch, basic concepts and methodology are also examined in this chapter. The specific application of economic approach in relation to civil liability for damages is discussed in the second part. It describes the choice between negligence and strict liability, problem of causation and procedural aspects of claims for compensation for damage. Special attention is drawn to the Learned Hand test <b>established</b> by <b>case-law</b> as a method to assess the conditions of liability. This method is based on considering economic criteria using a cost analysis. The part dealing with behavioral findings extending [...] ...|$|R

The freedom of establishment is generally exercised by seting-up of subsidiaries, branches and agencies on the territory of other Member State under the conditions laid down for its own nationals. The possibility for a company, incorporated under the law of a Member State to tranfer its resitered seat or central administration to another Member State without losing legal personality, is also examined in this thesis. It follows from the well <b>established</b> <b>case-law</b> of the Court of Justice of the EU that in the present state of the European law no right to transfer is confered to the companies which remain creatures of the national laws of the Member States which determine their incorporation and functionning...|$|E
40|$|The Kücükdeveci {{judgment}} {{confirmed the}} <b>established</b> <b>case-law</b> on {{the prohibition of}} the horizontal direct effect of directives. However, after Kücükdeveci the CJEU rendered several preliminary rulings that apparently contradict this case-law. They obliged national courts to preclude conflicting laws of Member States with directives, especially Directive 2000 / 78. This article picks up some recent judgments among those rulings and tries to reconcile them with the case-law, in reference to a theory recognizing the exclusionary effect of directives, which is a differentiated concept from the direct effect. The exclusionary effect {{can be understood as}} a corollary to recognizing direct applicability to directives, along with the primacy of EU law. This theory has gained some support from Advocate Generals and in the legal literature. Recently, some judges of the CJEU have also recognized this effect in their private works. Therefore, putting emphasis on direct applicability, this article analyzes the theory in search of a persuasive explanation of the consistency of jurisprudence on the effects of directives that have long been developed by the Court, although the whole picture of jurisprudence is not still clear...|$|E
40|$|According to the <b>established</b> <b>case-law</b> of the European Court of Human Rights, the Contracting Parties the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms {{have the}} {{obligation}} to provide aneffective remedy to the person that pretends that his right {{to a fair trial}} has been violated. Such a remedy must include a compensatory component; the European Court, in its judgments relating to Italian Pinto Law, underlined the essential character of the compensation in cases of excessive length of proceedings; still, the same Court encouraged States Parties not only to compensate, but also to offer an acceleratory remedy, {{in order to reduce the}} length of the procedures, as well as the amount of the compensation once the proceedings have been finalized. Following several major judgments pronounced by the European Court, some European States reacted by implementing such remedies: most solutions combine elements of acceleration with elements of compensation. The experience of such countries allows the institutionalization of a form of remedy that could be implemented also in Romania where, although there are some legal provisions stipulating some form of redress, we cannot talk of an authentic effective remedy. The present paper will focus on the acceleratory remedy, seen not only as a demarche at the disposal of the individual, but also as an interesting measure allowing for the reduction of length of procedures and thus limiting the effect of a violation of the right to a fair trial...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} study of how the European Convention of Human Rights, the European Union and Finland protect companies’ right to privacy in unannounced competition authority inspections. More precisely, it aims to establish the current scope of companies’ right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights and to assess if the European Union and Finland meet this standard. The key points of interests are {{the definition of the}} right from the perspective of companies, the limitations it sets to competition authorities, and the safeguards required to ensure that the right to privacy is respected. Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights is drafted to protect natural and legal persons from arbitrary actions of public authorities. This protection takes various forms. Pursuant to the wording of the article, the right to respect to private and family life, home and correspondence is protected. The article employs concepts that at the level of everyday language seem best suited for natural persons. During the past three decades, the European Court of Human Rights has interpreted the article as granting protection also to legal persons, companies included. The concept of home has been extended to business premises and the concept of correspondence to confidential communications between a lawyer and a company client. However, the Court has reserved contracting states a wider margin of appreciation regarding the rights of legal persons. This interpretation of Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights entails that unannounced competition authority inspections interfere, by their nature, with companies right to respect to home and, depending of the materials under inspection, also with the right to respect to correspondence. An interference does not amount to a violation of the article, but it triggers a number of safeguards to ensure that the interference is necessary and proportionate. The European Court of Human Rights has <b>established</b> in its <b>case-law</b> that all interferences with rights protected under Article 8 should be subject to prior judicial authorization or a posteriori judicial review. Other safeguards depend on the individual circumstances of each case, but judicial review has been established as an absolute requirement. This means that in competition authority inspections, both the inspection decision and the authority measures during an inspection should be subjected to judicial review. In Finland, this is not the case. Competition Act sets out a prohibition against appeal of the inspection decision. The inspection decision and the measures taken during an inspection may be appealed only if the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority makes a proposition of a penalty payment to the Market Court. This entails that all interferences with companies’ right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights are not subject to judicial review. As a contracting party to the Convention, Finland is under the obligation to comply with relevant interpretations of the Court. The requirement of judicial review appears to be one. The Finnish Government is preparing a reform of the Competition Act, whereby this question could be addressed {{as a part of the}} reform. The Report of the Working Group of the reform, which is addressed in this thesis, does not propose any improvements in this regard. The European Union, for its part, is not bound by the Convention. Nevertheless, the Convention still plays an important role in the European Union and it does contribute to the fundamental rights protection of companies in the European Union. This is the case particularly with Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights, as the fundamental right to privacy provided by Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union should correspond to that provided by the Convention. In practice, the question is more complex. Companies may subject the inspection decisions of European Commission to judicial review but the possibility to appeal inspection measures is more limited. Thereby, the European Union does not either meet the standard set out by the Article 8 of the Convention...|$|R
40|$|The Brussels I Regulation ((EU) No 1215 / 2010) {{governs the}} {{division}} of jurisdiction between the Member States of the European Union and provides for the circulation of judgments within the Member States in civil and commercial matters. Arbitration is excluded from {{the scope of the}} Regulation, and the Regulation should not affect the application of the New York Convention in the Member States. The arbitration exclusion reflects a traditional understanding that the systems of international civil procedure and international arbitration are expected to function autonomously. Despite this, the two systems occasionally collide as parties to a dispute attempt to initiate parallel court and arbitral proceedings. Further, if parallel court and arbitral proceedings on the same matter and between the same parties cannot be prevented, they may result in two at least partially overlapping and conflicting decisions. This study concerns first whether parallel court and arbitral proceedings can be prevented in ways that are compatible with the Regulation and the New York Convention. The second research question concerns on which grounds a Member State court is able to refuse recognition and enforcement of a Brussels I regime judgment that conflicts with an arbitral award. The study is based on doctrinal research, and the objectives of the study are twofold. First, the study examines the prevailing interpretation of the Regulation’s interface with arbitration and secondly, the study aims at presenting a recommendation regarding the application of the Regulation in case a Member State court is requested to enforce a judgment conflicting with an arbitral award. Regarding the first research question, the study examines the availability of measures restricting or discouraging parallel court and arbitral proceedings. The prohibition of court-ordered anti-suit injunctions <b>established</b> in the <b>case-law</b> of the CJEU under the old Brussels I Regulation ((EC) No 44 / 2001) remains applicable under the recast Regulation. Further, the assessment of whether Member State courts are permitted to order damages for breach of arbitration agreement appears to give a negative answer as such damages are argued to be contrary to the principle of mutual trust between Member State courts. On the contrary, the recognition and enforcement of anti-suit injunctions ordered by arbitrators and arbitral awards ordering damages for breach of arbitration agreement appear to be outside the scope of the Regulation but national laws of the Member States strongly limit the availability and enforceability of such measures. This leads to a conclusion that parallel court and arbitral proceedings cannot be effectively prevented under the Regulation. As a main rule, the decision which is rendered first is to be recognised and enforced in other Member States on the application of a party regardless of any pending parallel proceedings. The Regulation particularly prescribes that it shall not affect the application of the New York Convention, which has led to a discussion concerning the possibility of anti-enforcement injunctions directed against the enforcement of a judgment that has been rendered prior to an arbitral award on the same matter and between the same parties. Such injunctions appear, however, both incompatible with the Regulation and unnecessary with regard to the unaffected application of the New York Convention. If a Brussels I regime judgment has been given first, it can be enforced in accordance with the Regulation. The same applies to an arbitral award under the New York Convention if the recognition and enforcement of the award is sought first. The Regulation does not address on which grounds a Member State court may refuse the enforcement of a Brussels I regime judgment in case the enforcement is requested only after a conflicting arbitral award is recognised and enforced in the Member State addressed. It appears clear that the enforcement must be refused in such situation but, on the other hand, the grounds for refusal of recognition and enforcement of a Brussels I regime judgment are exhaustively listed in the Regulation. The study discusses four alternative grounds for refusing the enforcement. It is concluded that the enforcement of a conflicting Brussels I regime judgment should be refused on the grounds of being contrary to the public policy in the Member State addressed since the national public policy cannot accommodate recognition and enforcement of two irreconcilable decisions...|$|R
