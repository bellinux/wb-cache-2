Some of the evidence for this is anecdotal, but in the great apes in particular, experimental studies in ethology suggest that deception is actively practised by some animals.|$|E
25|$|With the {{economic}} development from the 1960s, {{the value of the}} 500-won notes fell, resulting in a greater use of cashier's checks with higher fixed denominations as means of payment, as well as an increased use of counterfeited ones.

25|$|The law {{was named}} after Sir Thomas Gresham, a sixteenth-century {{financial}} agent of the English Crown {{in the city of}} Antwerp, to explain to Queen Elizabeth I what was <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English shilling. Her father, Henry VIII, had replaced 40 percent of the silver in the coin with base metals, to increase the government's income without raising taxes. Astute English merchants and even ordinary subjects would save the good shillings from pure silver and circulate the bad ones; hence, the bad money would be used whenever possible, and the good coinage would be saved and disappear from circulation.|$|E

25|$|The Moon is {{gradually}} receding from Earth into a higher orbit, and calculations {{suggest that this}} would continue for about 50 billion years. By that time, Earth and the Moon {{would be in a}} mutual spin–orbit resonance or tidal locking, in which the Moon will orbit Earth in about 47 days (currently 27 days), and both the Moon and Earth would rotate around their axes in the same time, always facing each other with the same side. This has already happened to the Moon—the same side always faces Earth—and is also slowly <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earth. However, the slowdown of Earth's rotation is not occurring fast enough for the rotation to lengthen to a month before other effects change the situation: approximately 2.3 billion years from now, the increase of the Sun's radiation will have caused Earth's oceans to evaporate, removing the bulk of the tidal friction and acceleration.|$|E
25|$|The series {{begins with}} the {{destruction}} of a warehouse the club uses to store and assemble guns, which is their main source of income, by a rival MC right before the overdose of Jax's Methamphetamine-addicted ex-wife Wendy. An emergency C-section is performed, and their son Abel is delivered ten weeks prematurely. Jax finds his father's memoirs when he visits a storage unit to collect some old baby clothes. John Teller, Jax's father, was {{one of the founders of}} SAMCRO, and the book describes his trials with and hopes for the club. Jax's mother, Gemma Teller-Morrow, is now married to the President of SAMCRO, Clay Morrow. Jax's best friend Opie has just been released from prison for serving time for a club-related crime. The first season deals with Jax trying to reconcile things <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> club with what he reads in his father's memoirs, Opie trying to take a lesser role in the club, and local and federal law enforcement trying to shut down SAMCRO.|$|E
25|$|During this time, however, {{change was}} <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Scots Greys. Through {{a series of}} changes in uniform and equipment, the {{regiment}} began to be identified more as cavalry, rather than as mounted infantry. Drummers, an instrument of the infantry, were replaced with trumpeters, as was standard for cavalry regiments, in 1766. Two years later, the Scot Greys traded in their mitre-style grenadier cap for the tall bearskin hat that would remain {{a part of the}} regiment's uniform until its amalgamation in 1971. During this period, the Scots Greys also underwent an organizational change. Although deemed to be a heavy dragoon unit, each troop of the regiment was reorganised to include a detachment of light dragoons. These light dragoons were mounted on lighter, faster horses {{than the rest of the}} regiment. However, this increase in strength was soon lost, as the light troops of Scots Greys and other heavy dragoon regiments of the British Army were combined to form a new regiment, the 21st (Douglas's) Light Dragoons, in 1779.|$|E

500|$|As July {{approached}} {{and came to}} its close, Tancredo's standing improved somewhat with the looming Ames Straw Poll. His strategy to focus on Iowa continued, {{and the number of}} grassroots supporters in the state increased. On July 31, the campaign developed an interesting new strategy, offering a trip to Washington, D.C. and a tour of the capitol to anyone who brought 25 Tancredo supporters to the straw poll. On the day before, supporters in Iowa distributed T-shirts which read [...] "I'm a Member of Tom's Army Against Amnesty." [...] Interviewed supporters were asked why they supported the candidate, they replied, [...] "He really has the concerns of America at heart, he's concerned about the culture of America itself. What's <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bedrock of American culture." [...] Tancredo finished in fourth place at the Ames Straw poll with over 14% of the vote.

500|$|In 1957 Paris, {{a series}} of mysterious killings are {{committed}} against young women of the same blood type who are found dead and drained of their blood. These killings are reported in the press as being performed by a murderer coined The Vampire. The journalist Pierre Lantin (Dario Michaelis) begins to investigate, and becomes more involved when his fiancee, the dancer Nora Duval is kidnapped. As Inspector Chantal (Carlo D'Angelo) examines the crime scene, Lantin arrives predicting that the crime was committed by The Vampire. Lantin investigates the school that the latest murder happened at to search for clues and finds that the woman was being followed by a tall man before the murder. Elsewhere, a man named Joseph (Paul Muller) begs for [...] "his fix" [...] {{in a dark room}} is told to go after a woman named Lorette (Wandisa Guida) and that he [...] "know what to do" [...] at Rue Saint Etienne. Joseph arrives at the location and is spotted by Lantin but manages to get away from him. Joseph arrives at the clinic of Professor Julian Du Grand (Antoine Balpêtré) and demands money to leave town or he will report what's <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> police. He is strangled by Du Grand's assistant when a shadowed woman named Marguerite arrives and states that if the police track them down, it will be the end of Du Grands career.
