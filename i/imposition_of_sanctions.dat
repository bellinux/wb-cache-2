25|$|Following the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979 {{there was}} a {{transition}} to internationally recognized majority rule in 1980; the United Kingdom ceremonially granted Zimbabwe independence on 18 April that year. In the 2000s Zimbabwe's economy began to deteriorate due to various factors, including, the <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanctions,</b> such as among others the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001, following the switch from Willing Buyer, Willing Seller to Fast Track land reform and also due to intensive economic corruption. Economic instability {{caused a lot of}} Zimbabweans to move overseas or to neighboring countrys. Prior to its recognized independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, the nation had been known by several names: Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia and Zimbabwe Rhodesia.|$|E

25|$|The oil sales losses Iran is {{experiencing}} {{are likely to}} produce over $50 billion in hard currency revenue losses in a one-year period at current oil prices. The IMF estimated Iran’s hard currency reserves to be $106 billion as {{of the end of}} 2011, and some economists say that figure may have fallen to about $80 billion as of November 2012. Analysts at one outside group, the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, believe Iran’s hard currency reserves might be exhausted entirely by July 2014 at current rates of depletion. Compounding the loss of oil sales by volume is that many of its oil transactions reportedly are now conducted on a barter basis—or in exchange for gold, which is hard currency but harder to use than cash is. In addition, the 6 February 2013, <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> on Iran’s ability to repatriate hard currency could cause the depletion rate to increase.|$|E
500|$|As Prince of Wales, Edward had {{publicly}} {{referred to}} Labour county councillors as [...] "cranks" [...] and made speeches counter to government policy. During his reign as king, {{his refusal to}} accept the advice of ministers continued: he opposed the <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> on Italy after its invasion of Ethiopia, refused to receive the deposed Emperor of Ethiopia, and would not support a strengthening of the League of Nations.|$|E
500|$|In 1915, {{a similar}} {{body to the}} Bryce group {{proposals}} {{was set up in}} the United States by a group of like-minded individuals, including William Howard Taft. It was called the League to Enforce Peace and was substantially based on the proposals of the Bryce Group. It advocated the use of arbitration in conflict resolution and the <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> on aggressive countries. None of these early organisations envisioned a continuously functioning body; {{with the exception of the}} Fabian Society in England, they maintained a legalistic approach that would limit the international body to a court of justice. The Fabians were the first to argue for a [...] "Council" [...] of states, necessarily the Great Powers, who would adjudicate world affairs, and for the creation of a permanent secretariat to enhance international co-operation across a range of activities.|$|E

3000|$|... 8 In some cases, UBII {{recipients}} appeal {{against the}} <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> a <b>sanction.</b> Social courts {{then have to}} decide on the legitimacy <b>of</b> the <b>sanction.</b> The average duration of litigations in these instances was 13.7 months in 2007 (see Statistisches Bundesamt 2009). This period is considerably longer than our observation period of six months after the (hypothetical) <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sanction.</b> Therefore, we do not expect that a potential appeal <b>of</b> <b>sanctioned</b> survey participant against the benefit cut affects his or her behavior in our observation window. Since the sanction is in force despite the appeal, there is the same incentive to increase job search effort as in the case without an appeal.|$|R
40|$|A charge {{commonly}} lodged against {{forgiveness is}} that it violates justice. My essay is an evaluation of this charge. Almost always the charge is developed by assuming that forgiveness requires foregoing punishment of the wrongdoer whereas justice requires punishment. My conclusion is that this charge cannot be sustained; though full and complete forgiveness does require foregoing punishment, foregoing punishment {{is not necessarily a}} violation of justice. I concede, however, that if a just deterrence system is in place, then, whereas full and complete forgiveness requires foregoing the <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> deterrence <b>sanctions,</b> justice may well require the <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> such <b>sanctions...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Because the ILOs {{enforcement}} and sanction mechanisms are weak, {{there has been}} significant discussion about incorporating labour standards in the World Trade Organisation's operation, since its formation in 1994. The WTO oversees, primarily, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which is a treaty aimed at reducing customs, tariffs and other barriers to free import and export of goods, services and capital between its 157 member countries. Unlike for the ILO, if the WTO rules on trade are contravened, member states who secure a judgment by the Dispute Settlement procedures (effectively a judicial process) may retaliate through trade sanctions. This could include reimposition of targeted tariffs against the non-compliant country. Proponents of an integrated approach {{have called for a}} [...] "social clause" [...] to be inserted into the GATT agreements, for example by amending article XX, which gives an exception to the general trade barrier reduction rules allowing <b>imposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>sanctions</b> for breaches of human rights. An explicit reference to core labour standards could allow action where a WTO member state is found to be in breach of ILO standards. Opponents argue that such an approach could backfire and undermine labour rights, as a country's industries, and therefore its workforce, are necessarily harmed but without any guarantee that labour reform would take place. Furthermore, it was argued in the Singapore Ministerial Declaration 1996 that [...] "the comparative advantage of countries, particularly low-age developing countries, must in no way be put into question." [...] On this view, countries {{ought to be able to}} take advantage of low wages and poor conditions at work as a comparative advantage in order to boost their exports. It is disputed that business will relocate production to low wage countries from higher wage countries such as the UK, because that choice is said to depend on productivity of workers. However, the view of many labour lawyers and economists remains that more trade, when workers have weaker bargaining power and less mobility, still allows business to opportunistically take advantage of workers by moving production, and that a coordinated multilateral approach with targeted measures against specific exports is preferable. While the WTO has yet to incorporate labour rights into its procedures for dispute settlements, many countries began to make bilateral agreements that protected core labour standards instead. Moreover, in domestic tariff regulations not yet touched by the WTO agreements, countries have given preference to other countries who do respect core labour rights, for example under the EU Tariff Preference Regulation, articles 7 and 8.|$|E
