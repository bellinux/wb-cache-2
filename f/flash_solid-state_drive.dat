40|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>solid-state</b> <b>drives</b> (SSDs) {{provide much}} faster {{access to data}} {{compared}} with traditional hard disk drives (HDDs). The current price and performance of SSD suggest it can be adopted as a data buffer between main memory and HD-D, and buffer management policy in such hybrid systems has attracted more and more interest from research commu-nity recently. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to manage the buffer in flash-based hybrid storage system-s, named Hotness Aware Hit (HAT). HAT exploits a page reference queue to record the access history {{as well as the}} status of accessed pages, i. e., hot, warm and cold. Addition-ally, the page reference queue is further split into hot and warm regions which correspond to the memory and flash in general. The HAT approach updates the page status and deals with the page migration in the memory hierarchy ac-cording to the current page status and hit position in the page reference queue.

Disk throughput degrades dramatically due to seek time overhead when the server is called upon to serve a large number of simultaneous video streams.

25|$|As {{bit cell}} size decreases, more {{data can be}} put onto a single drive platter. In 2013, a {{production}} desktop 3TB HDD (with four platters) would have had an areal density of about 500Gbit/in2 which would have amounted to a bit cell comprising about 18 magnetic grains (11 by 1.6 grains). Since the mid-2000s areal density progress has increasingly been challenged by a superparamagnetic trilemma involving grain size, grain magnetic strength and ability of the head to write. In order to maintain acceptable signal to noise smaller grains are required; smaller grains may self-reverse (electrothermal instability) unless their magnetic strength is increased, but known write head materials are unable to generate a magnetic field sufficient to write the medium. Several new magnetic storage technologies are being developed to overcome or at least abate this trilemma and thereby maintain the competitiveness of HDDs with respect to products such as <b>flash</b> memory-based <b>solid-state</b> <b>drives</b> (SSDs).|$|R

In this paper we propose use of product code based schemes to support higher error correction capability.

While these schemes have slightly larger latency and require additional parity bit storage, they provide an easy mechanism to increase the lifetime of the Flash memory devices.

As it turns out, random write is extremely detrimental to the lifetime of SSD drives. This paper focuses on the following problem, namely, P 2 P file downloading when the target of the download is an SSD drive. We make three contributions: first, analysis of write patterns of downloading program to establish the premise of the problem; second, development of a simple yet powerful technique called FlashLite to combat this problem, by automatically converting the random writes to sequential writes; third, showing through performance evaluation using modified eMule file downloading program that FlashLite does change random writes to sequential, and most importantly eliminates about 94 % of erase operations of the original eMule program...|$|R
40|$|The {{database}} {{storage hierarchy}} has been heavily optimized {{for the performance}} characteristics of disks. Storage managers typically employ row- or column-oriented storage layouts, or a combination, to improve the I/O performance of different query workloads with disks. The recent rise of <b>flash</b> memory-based <b>solid-state</b> <b>drives</b> (SSDs) significantly change the performance characteristics of storage: these drives provide {{an order of magnitude}} lower read/access latencies, significantly higher read bandwidths, and most importantly, negligible seek overheads. In light of these differences, we analyze major storage optimizations for read-optimized databases. We examine the benefits of row and column-oriented storage layouts on flash SSDs. Our measurements span through different workload variations, including selectivity, projectivity and concurrency that affect query processing on flash. Further, we also investigate the cost and benefits of a set of database optimizations, including data compression, prefetching, and indexes on flash SSDs. We back our experimental evaluation with analytical models of the performance tradeoffs of these optimizations. Three of our key findings are: (1) SSDs scale up linearly with concurrent execution of database queries and outperform disks by up to a factor of two, (2) the low seek cost on SSDs makes columnstorage a better choice for laying out data on a variety of flash devices, (3) and that while data compression is useful to further leverage the bandwidth of flash, database prefetching has less benefit for flash storage. Finally, we present a list of design implications of our findings on future database and operating systems for effectively embracing flash storage...|$|R
