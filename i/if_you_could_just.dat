40|$|Dependent types {{can make}} your {{developments}} (be they programs or proofs) dramatically safer by allowing you {{to prove that you}} implemented what you intended. Unfortunately, they can also make your developments dramatically more boring by requiring you to elaborate those proofs in often painstaking detail. For this reason, dependently typed languages typically allow you to cheat by postulating some facts as axioms. However, type theory is not just about which types are inhabited; it’s about how things compute. Computationally, an axiom is a stuck term, so it prevents you from evaluating your programs.

5000|$|In a NASA {{interview}} {{prior to}} his 2000 spaceflight, Scott Altman commented on his role as an F-14 pilot involved in the filming of Top Gun: [...] Well, Top Gun was a real thrill. I still remember that so vividly. The word was going around town that Hollywood was coming to Miramar, where I was stationed, {{and they were going}} to do a movie, and we were all kind of excited. My squadron had just gotten back from a seven-and-a-half-month cruise about a week and a half before, so our airplanes were at home, we were available, we weren't too highly tasked. And it turned out they picked my squadron to supply the F-14s.Then the skipper got together and tried to pick four guys that he thought, were mature enough, I guess, to handle, you know, the capability that they were being given in working with the movie, and all the things that were required. And the director wanted to have a small cadre of people that he could work with so you develop an understanding of what the movie folks want versus what we can do and how to try and balance those two requirements.The flying was incredible. You know, most Navy pilots don't get to buzz the tower like in the movie - <b>if</b> <b>you</b> did <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> peel your wings off and, throw 'em at the door because you probably wouldn't be flying anymore - but, since it was Hollywood, you know, they wanted the scene. I had to buzz the tower. And, of course, they wanted nine different takes - so we did it nine times! ...|$|R
40|$|Heterogeneity {{complicates the}} {{efficient}} use of multicomputer platforms, but does it enhance their performance? their cost effectiveness? How can one measure {{the power of a}} heterogeneous assemblage of computers (“cluster, ” for short), both in absolute terms (how powerful is this cluster) and relative terms (which cluster is the most powerful) ? What makes one cluster more powerful than another? Is one better off with a cluster that has one super-fast computer and the rest of just “average ” speed or with a cluster all of whose computers are “moderately ” fast? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> replace <b>just</b> one computer in your cluster with a faster one, which computer would you choose: the fastest? the slowest? How does one even ask questions such as these in a formal, yet tractable manner? A framework is proposed, and some answers are derived, a few rather surprising. Three highlights: (1) If one can replace only one computer in a cluster by a faster one, it is provably (almost) always most advantageous to replace the fastest one. (2) If the computers in two clusters have the same mean speed, then, empirically, the cluster with the larger variance in speed is (almost) always the faster one. (3) Heterogeneity can actually lend power to a cluster...|$|R

5000|$|By {{the time}} he was 20 he was reading books on {{philosophy}} and neuroscience, the latter because he wanted to know how the brain functions, partly because of his experiences with depression and anxiety.

5000|$|Cantu's biggest {{cause was}} the miracle berry, which he {{believed}} could end hunger by {{allowing people to}} eat normally unpalatable food and end dependence on processed sugar. At the 2011 TEDx conference, he explained his vision: If you look at developing countries and things like that, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> open up {{maybe two or three}} ingredients that are hyper-local, so we don't have to distribute products, you're knocking down food miles ... I was out in my backyard one day, and I popped a miracle berry, and then I just started eating blades of grass ... And so, let's just stop and think about it: hyper-local cuisine would be just that: you walk out your door, and you don't look at it as weeds; it's now a new page in gastronomy. [...] On Future Food, Cantu demonstrated this idea by spending a week on a diet of miracle berries and common weeds, grass, and leaves he found in his backyard. [...] He would also regularly donate the berries to cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy to make food more palatable to them.|$|E

5000|$|Smith {{learned about}} cartooning from comic strips, comic books, and {{animated}} TV shows. The strip he {{found to be}} the most entertaining was Charles M. Schulz's Peanuts, which he had his father read to him every Sunday, and which inspired him to learn to read. Smith was also inspired by Scrooge McDuck creator Carl Barks, whom Smith calls a [...] "natural comic genius" [...] for his ability to move characters effectively from panel to panel, and for their expressiveness. Alluding to the influence of Barks' influence on Bone, Smith commented, [...] "I always wanted Uncle Scrooge to go on a longer adventure. I thought, 'Man, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>just</b> get a comic book of that quality, the length of say, War and Peace, or The Odyssey or something, that would be something I would love to read, and even as a kid I looked everywhere for that book, that Uncle Scrooge story that was 1,100 pages long." [...] Another seminal influence began when Smith was nine, and he saw The Pogo Special Birthday Special on TV, which was created by Walt Kelly and Chuck Jones, whom he would later call [...] "two of my most favorite people". The day after that program aired, a girl brought her father's Pogo book to school and gave it to Smith, who says it [...] "changed comics" [...] for him. Smith keeps that book on a table next to his drawing board today, and refers to Kelly as his [...] "biggest influence in writing comics".|$|E
5000|$|The director, Fred Schepisi, {{later said}} that, while {{he liked the}} film, it was not what it could have been:"The problem was there were two other producers, there was a studio and there was Tim Robbins {{and they were all}} contributing, and Tim Robbins was being {{difficult}} because he said in the '90s nobody would like a character who has a woman fall in love with him because of a lie. That's the whole premise of the film. And it's all right for him to know that and believe it, but he should spend the whole time trying to say, [...] "Hey, I'm lying to you," [...] and be constantly frustrated. Because of that attitude, he pulled the film this way, he pulled it that way while we were writing and it just felt messy. And nobody ever understood the value of those four scientists, and I like the cast that I had, but the other three scientists apart from Walter Matthau were originally going to be Peter Ustinov, Barry Humphries and John Cleese.
