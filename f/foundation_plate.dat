The calculation {{is based on the}} solution of the differential equation of bending plate by finite difference method. The calculation results are compared with the numerical solution in the program complex. The percentage of differences of values depending on the method of division or method of solving is shown. We considered a problem when a <b>foundation</b> <b>plate</b> and a construction are plates, which are deformed together, that, in fact, corresponds to the problem of bending a two-layer plate on elastic basis. In case of a two-layer plate in order to find the solution of the problem we need to solve the equation of bending of plates that are structurally similar to the traditional, but still give different results. In solving finite difference operators derivatives are substituted into differential equation which must be in accordance with each grid point, {{as well as at the}} border. If we consider the problem in the conventional formulation, only the lower layer is bended in the plate; the analysis of the plate, which takes into account the weight of its own layers, both layers are deformed together. Also when considering a two-layer plate, the neutral layer is deposed away from the upper layer, consequently, the whole <b>foundation</b> <b>plate</b> may be in the condition of stretching.

In connection with the deficiency of exsiting researches, through the established finite element analysis model on Type ∏ terminal restricted configuration transition section,its mechanical characteristics under the most unfavorable longitudinal load by changing the structural parameters of transition section are analyzed, focusing on the criterion that the range of maximum of longitudinal displacement is 3 mm. Analysis results show that when the longitudinal force is being transmitted to the anchorage structure, the maximum stress and longitudinal displacement of main terminal restricted configuration are {{far less than the}} limit and this process has little influence on track geometrical regularity. The laying of sliding layer can ameliorate structural force and deformation. However, changing its friction coefficient has no effect.

40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} between plates and foundations {{is a typical}} problem encountered in geotechnical engineering. The long-term plate performance is highly dependent on the rheological characteristics of ground soil. Compared with conventional linear rheology, the fractional calculus-based theory is a more powerful mathematical tool that can address this issue. This paper proposes a fractional Merchant model (FMM) to investigate the time-dependent behavior of a simply supported rectangular plate on viscoelastic foundation. The correspondence principle involving Laplace transforms was employed to derive the closed-form solutions of plate response under uniformly distributed load. The plate deflection, bending moment, and foundation reaction calculated using the FMM were compared with the results obtained from the analogous elastic model (EM) and the standard Merchant model (SMM). It is shown that {{the upper and lower}} bound solutions of the FMM can be determined using the EM. In addition, a parametric study was performed to examine the influences of the model parameters on the time-dependent behavior of the plate–foundation interaction problem. The results indicate that a small fractional differential order corresponds to a plate resting on a sandy soil foundation, while the fractional differential order value should be increased for a clayey soil foundation. The long-term performance of a <b>foundation</b> <b>plate</b> can be accurately simulated by varying the values of the fractional differential order and the viscosity coefficient. The observations from this study reveal that the proposed fractional model has the capability to capture the variation of plate deflection over many decades of time...|$|E

Development of these territories is hampered {{for a number of}} reasons, including poor weather and soil conditions, lack of infrastructure, roads, networks, and remoteness from industrial enterprises. Traditional building methods are rather expensive. The latter circumstance calls for new types of residential and public buildings, with the main requirement being their transportability (by air and land transport), higher degree of prefabrication (including foundations), light weight of structures, fast assembly, possibility of assembly and installation of large components without the use of heavy machinery, application of local materials, structural reliability, especially in the conditions of unstable soils. Construction operations on permafrost soils are not to alter the soil properties. The proposed structure of low-rise buildings is aimed at the attainment of the followings objectives: assimilation of hardly accessible areas of Siberia, development of low-rise housing, and secondary use of veneer waste products. A prefabricated building of the closed type consists of a <b>foundation</b> <b>plate,</b> as well as walls and coverings arranged {{in the form of a}} spatial framework united into a single manifold system. Beam elements of a prefabricated building are to be made of timber-based materials and assembled into a single bolted mountable and dismountable structure by means of a system of shaped metal node elements.
