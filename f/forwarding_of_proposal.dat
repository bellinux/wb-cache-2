40|$|Policy Routing (PR) is a {{new area}} of devleopment that {{attempts}} to incorporate policy related constraints on inter-Administrative Domain (AD) communication into the route computation and <b>forwarding</b> <b>of</b> inter-AD packets. <b>Proposals</b> for inter-AD routing mechansims {{are discussed in the}} context of a design space defined by three design parameters: location of routing decision (i. e., source or hop-by-hop), algorithm used (i. e., link state or distance vector), and expression of policy in topology or in link status. We conclude that an architecture based upon source routing, a link state algorithm, and policy information in the link state advertisements, is best able to address the long-term policy requirements of inter-AD routing.

40|$|The new {{proposals}} {{concerning the}} Regulation on Rural Development (RD) policy 1 after 2013 is being discussed in EU institutions and Member States. In a previous paper, we put <b>forward</b> a series <b>of</b> <b>proposals</b> concerning {{the future of}} rural development policies after 2013. In particular, we outlined the importance of better integration of the Europe 2020 Strategy, a more coordinated and simplified programming system and finally a greater flexibility. This Policy Brief intends to further contribute to the present debate and clarify the main challenges ahead. It argues that the EU proposals move <b>forwards</b> in terms <b>of</b> relevant institutional innovations but move backwards by taking a more conservative stance. Four themes in the Commission’s 2014 - 2020 proposals that were changed {{with regards to the}} current programming period will be analysed: strategic programming, programming design, implementing rules and funding rural development.

A detailed evaluation of DSR with non-optimal route suppression is found to yield significant improvements in both protocol efficiency and performance. Comment: 10 pages, 17 figure...|$|R

On the basis of our inspection, we summed up the features of the current banking system in China as being similar to other countries with a planned economy, namely, that money is not a positive instrument affecting the course of reproduction but only a negative reflection of this course. We went a step further to draw the conclusion that China's grass-roots banks today are characterized by "large reserves, lax restrictions, and low risks. " We believe that to ensure the success of reform of the monetary system, restraints on the payment capability of the grass-roots banks should be strengthened from the very beginning, prudently and step by step. In this connection, we put <b>forward</b> a number <b>of</b> <b>proposals</b> on matters <b>of</b> policy. ...|$|R

The ISU can provide technical and secretariat support to financial cooperation processes in the region, which have thus far been driven by officials on a part-time basis. Consolidation of the main financial forums in the region is also proposed, specifically the Finance Minister Process and the Central Bank Process. Membership of these two processes should be expanded and unified, with the ISU providing technical and secretariat support. It is argued that regular policy meetings can be institutionalized and that this could enhance the role of East Asia in the global financial arena, whilst facilitating policy cooperation, with important regional and global implications. asian financial cooperation; asian policy cooperation; asian institutional infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|Proposals {{to improve}} the {{performance}} of TCP in high speed networks have been recently put <b>forward.</b> Examples <b>of</b> such <b>proposals</b> include High Speed TCP, Scalable TCP, and FAST. In contrast to the additive increase multiplicative decrease algorithm used in the standard TCP, Scalable TCP uses a multiplicative increase multiplicative decrease (MIMD) algorithm for the window size evolution. In this paper, we present a mathematical analysis of the MIMD congestion control algorithm {{in the presence of}} random losses. Random losses are typical to wireless networks but {{can also be used to}} model losses in wireline networks with a high bandwidth-delay product. Our approach is based on showing that the logarithm of the window size evolution has the same behaviour as the workload process in a standard G/G/ 1 queue. The Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the equivalent queue is then shown to directly provide the throughput of the congestion control algorithm and the higher moments of the window size. Using ns- 2 simulations, we validate our findings using Scalable TCP...|$|R
