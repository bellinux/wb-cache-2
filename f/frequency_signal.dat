5|$|The most {{important}} and widely used application of the heterodyne technique is in the superheterodyne receiver (superhet), invented by U.S. engineer Edwin Howard Armstrong in 1918. In this circuit, the incoming radio <b>frequency</b> <b>signal</b> from the antenna is mixed with a signal from a local oscillator (LO) and converted by the heterodyne technique to a lower fixed <b>frequency</b> <b>signal</b> called the intermediate frequency (IF). This IF is amplified and filtered, before being applied to a detector which extracts the audio signal, which {{is sent to the}} loudspeaker.|$|E
25|$|A further {{advantage}} is that the radar can operate effectively at relatively low frequencies. This was important in the early development of this type when high <b>frequency</b> <b>signal</b> generation was difficult or expensive.|$|E
25|$|Fast moving {{satellites}} {{can have}} a Doppler shift of dozens of kilohertz relative to a ground station. The speed, thus magnitude of Doppler effect, changes due to earth curvature. Dynamic Doppler compensation, where the frequency of a signal is changed multiple times during transmission, is used so the satellite receives a constant <b>frequency</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E

Because of the periodicity of laughter body motion, body motion {{can be considered as}} the combination of three different <b>frequency</b> <b>signals.</b> During the training step, the framework captures the relation between intensity signal and output <b>signals</b> such as <b>frequency</b> <b>signals.</b> During the synthesis step, the trained framework takes as input intensity signal and works as generator of <b>frequency</b> <b>signals.</b> Generated body motion is used to animate a laughing virtual character agent. </p...|$|R
25|$|In October 2006 the Mars Express {{spacecraft}} {{has encountered}} a superior solar conjunction (alignment of Earth-Sun-Mars Express). The angle Sun-Earth-MEX reached a minimum on 23-Oct at 0.39 deg. {{at a distance}} of 2.66 AU. Operational measures were undertaken to minimize the impact of the link degradation, since the higher density of electrons in the solar plasma heavily impacts the radio <b>frequency</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Drifting in open {{seas and}} {{international}} waters, as encountered on long sea voyages and by military forces, requires prolonged survival in water. Suitable life jackets are often {{attached to a}} vest with pockets and attachment points for distress signaling and survival aids, for example, a handheld two-way radio (walkie-talkie), emergency beacon (406MHz <b>frequency),</b> <b>signal</b> mirror, sea marker dye, smoke or light signal flares, strobe light, first-aid supplies, concentrated nutritional items, water purification supplies, shark repellent, knife, and pistol.|$|E
25|$|Local {{oscillators}} typically {{generate a}} single <b>frequency</b> <b>signal</b> that has negligible amplitude modulation but some random phase modulation. Either of these impurities spreads {{some of the}} signal's energy into sideband frequencies. That causes a corresponding widening of the receiver's frequency response, which would defeat the aim {{to make a very}} narrow bandwidth receiver such as to receive low-rate digital signals. Care needs to be taken to minimize oscillator phase noise, usually by ensuring that the oscillator never enters a non-linear mode.|$|E

40|$|For pulse {{compression}} characteristics and not easily affected by noise, linear <b>frequency</b> modulation <b>signal</b> {{are widely used}} in underwater acoustic communication. This paper analyzes the characteristics of hyperbolic <b>frequency</b> modulation <b>signal</b> over underwater acoustic channels. Compared with linear <b>frequency</b> modulation <b>signal,</b> hyperbolic <b>frequency</b> modulation has the same performance of strong anti-noise and anti-multipath, what’s more, hyperbolic <b>frequency</b> modulation <b>signal</b> is better resist the influence of doppler. And discussed the influence of doppler on signal, simulation {{results show that the}} hyperbolic <b>frequency</b> modulation <b>signal</b> detection rate is better than linear <b>frequency</b> modulation <b>signal</b> in the doppler environment. </p...|$|R
25|$|Low-impedance {{microphones}} are preferred {{over high}} impedance for two reasons: {{one is that}} using a high-impedance microphone with a long cable results in high <b>frequency</b> <b>signal</b> loss due to cable capacitance, which forms a low-pass filter with the microphone output impedance. The other is that long high-impedance cables tend to pick up more hum (and possibly radio-frequency interference (RFI) as well). Nothing is damaged if the impedance between microphone and other equipment is mismatched; the worst that happens is a reduction in signal or change in frequency response.|$|E
25|$|The {{first use}} for the diode was the {{demodulation}} of amplitude modulated (AM) radio broadcasts. The history of this discovery is treated in depth in the radio article. In summary, an AM signal consists of alternating positive and negative peaks of a radio carrier wave, whose amplitude or envelope {{is proportional to the}} original audio signal. The diode (originally a crystal diode) rectifies the AM radio <b>frequency</b> <b>signal,</b> leaving only the positive peaks of the carrier wave. The audio is then extracted from the rectified carrier wave using a simple filter and fed into an audio amplifier or transducer, which generates sound waves.|$|E
25|$|The modem is {{sometimes}} called the terminal unit and is an electronic device which is connected between the teleprinter and the radio transceiver. The transmitting part of the modem converts the digital signal transmitted by the teleprinter or tape reader to {{one or the other}} of a pair of audio frequency tones, traditionally 2295/2125Hz (US) or 2125/1955Hz (Europe). One of the tones corresponds to the mark condition and the other to the space condition. These audio tones, then, modulate an SSB transmitter to produce the final audio-frequency shift keying (AFSK) radio <b>frequency</b> <b>signal.</b> Some transmitters are capable of direct frequency-shift keying (FSK) as they can directly accept the digital signal and change their transmitting frequency according to the mark or space input state. In this case the transmitting part of the modem is bypassed.|$|E
50|$|There are no similar {{loudspeaker}} {{power handling}} regulations in the US; {{the problem is}} much harder as many loudspeaker systems have very different power handling capacities at different frequencies (e.g., tweeters which handle high <b>frequency</b> <b>signals</b> are physically small and easily damaged, while woofers which handle low <b>frequency</b> <b>signals</b> are larger and more robust).|$|R

5000|$|Additionally, {{the heads}} are {{arranged}} so {{the combination of}} the two signals results in a small [...] "dead zone" [...] directly past the recording head where high <b>frequency</b> <b>signals</b> are blanked out. This prevents subsequent high <b>frequency</b> <b>signals</b> from interfering with those just recorded, by the time they exit the dead zone they are too far from the head to be overwritten.|$|R
25|$|To {{perform a}} study, {{the person is}} {{positioned}} within an MRI scanner that forms a strong magnetic field around the area to be imaged. In most medical applications, protons (hydrogen atoms) in tissues containing water molecules create a signal that is processed to form {{an image of the}} body. First, energy from an oscillating magnetic field temporarily is applied to the patient at the appropriate resonance frequency. The excited hydrogen atoms emit a radio <b>frequency</b> <b>signal,</b> which is measured by a receiving coil. The radio signal may be made to encode position information by varying the main magnetic field using gradient coils. As these coils are rapidly switched on and off they create the characteristic repetitive noise of an MRI scan. The contrast between different tissues is determined by the rate at which excited atoms return to the equilibrium state. Exogenous contrast agents may be given intravenously, orally, or intra-articularly.|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} {{was provided by}} well-known tube expert Robert W. Sutton at the Admiralty Signals Establishment. He designed a new tube for this purpose, today known as the Sutton tube but then more widely known as a reflex klystron. This was essentially a conventional two-cavity klystron with one cavity removed. The remaining cavity was fed a tiny amount of the output from the magnetron, causing the electrons passing by it {{to take up the}} pattern of the radio signal (this is the basis of all klystrons). Normally this would then pass the second resonator where the output would be tapped, but in the Sutton tube, the electrons instead approached a high-voltage plate that reflected them back towards their source. By carefully controlling the voltage of the reflector, the electrons would arrive having gained or lost a controlled amount of velocity, thus inducing a different <b>frequency</b> <b>signal</b> in the cavity as they passed it the second time. The combination of the original and new frequency produced a new signal that was sent to the conventional receiver. Sutton delivered an example producing 300mW in October 1940.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the advent}} of laser technology, {{coherent}} radio sources were used for interferometry measurements {{of the speed of}} light. However interferometric determination of wavelength becomes less precise with wavelength and the experiments were thus limited in precision by the long wavelength (~) of the radiowaves. The precision can be improved by using light with a shorter wavelength, but then it becomes difficult to directly measure the frequency of the light. One way around this problem is to start with a low <b>frequency</b> <b>signal</b> of which the frequency can be precisely measured, and from this signal progressively synthesize higher frequency signals whose frequency can then be linked to the original signal. A laser can then be locked to the frequency, and its wavelength can be determined using interferometry. This technique was due to a group at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) (which later became NIST). They used it in 1972 to measure the speed of light in vacuum with a [...] fractional uncertainty of [...]|$|E

2500|$|There are two {{principal}} {{means by which}} touchpads work. In the matrix approach, a series of conductors are arranged {{in an array of}} parallel lines in two layers, separated by an insulator and crossing each other at right angles to form a grid. [...] A high <b>frequency</b> <b>signal</b> is applied sequentially between pairs in this two-dimensional grid array. [...] The current that passes between the nodes is proportional to the capacitance. When a virtual ground, such as a finger, is placed over one of the intersections between the conductive layer some of the electrical field is shunted to this ground point, resulting in a change in the apparent capacitance at that location. This method received [...] awarded to George Gerpheide in April 1994.|$|E
2500|$|MRI uses strong {{magnetic}} fields to align atomic nuclei (usually hydrogen protons) within body tissues, then uses a radio signal {{to disturb the}} axis of rotation of these nuclei and observes the radio <b>frequency</b> <b>signal</b> generated as the nuclei return to their baseline states. [...] The radio signals are collected by small antennae, called coils, placed near the area of interest. An advantage of MRI {{is its ability to}} produce images in axial, coronal, sagittal and multiple oblique planes with equal ease. MRI scans give the best soft tissue contrast of all the imaging modalities. With advances in scanning speed and spatial resolution, and improvements in computer 3D algorithms and hardware, MRI has become an important tool in musculoskeletal radiology and neuroradiology.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{magnitude}} 5 earthquakes, {{the strongest}} in Iceland since 1996, were recorded on 24 August, {{with the first}} at 00:09, {{but there were no}} visible signs of activity. [...] "Probably, earthquakes near the Bárðarbunga caldera are a consequence of adjustment to changes in pressure, because of the flow of magma from under the caldera into the dyke which stretches to Dyngjujökull, more than 25km away." [...] Following a scientists' meeting at 11:50, the Aviation Color Code was reduced to Orange. It was stated that 700 earthquakes of larger magnitudes than previously recorded had been observed since midnight; the dyke stretching to the north was estimated at 30km in length; activity showed no signs of abating and an imminent eruption was considered possible; the intense low <b>frequency</b> <b>signal</b> detected on 23 August was not caused by a sub-glacial eruption.|$|E

2500|$|Superheterodyne {{receivers}} {{require a}} local oscillator and mixer, combined in {{the function of}} a single pentagrid converter tube. Various alternatives such as {{using a combination of}} a triode with a hexode and even an octode have been used for this purpose. The additional grids include both control grids (at a low potential) and screen grids (at a high voltage). Many designs used such a screen grid as an additional anode to provide feedback for the oscillator function, whose current was added to that of the incoming radio <b>frequency</b> <b>signal.</b> The pentagrid converter thus became widely used in AM receivers including the miniature tube version of the [...] "All American Five". Octodes such as the 7A8 were rarely used in the US, but much more common in Europe, particularly in battery operated radios where the lower power consumption was an advantage.|$|E

The point of contact between the wire and the crystal produced a diode effect. [...] The cat's whisker detector was a crude Schottky diode that allowed current to flow better in one direction than in the opposite direction. Modern crystal sets use modern semiconductor diodes. [...] The crystal functions as an envelope detector, rectifying the alternating current radio signal to a pulsing direct current, the peaks of which trace out the audio signal, {{so it can be}} converted to sound by the earphone, which is connected to the detector.|$|E
2500|$|RF {{condenser}} microphones use {{a comparatively}} low RF voltage, {{generated by a}} low-noise oscillator. The signal from the oscillator may either be amplitude modulated by the capacitance changes produced by the sound waves moving the capsule diaphragm, or the capsule {{may be part of}} a resonant circuit that modulates the frequency of the oscillator signal. Demodulation yields a low-noise audio <b>frequency</b> <b>signal</b> with a very low source impedance. The absence of a high bias voltage permits the use of a diaphragm with looser tension, which may be used to achieve wider frequency response due to higher compliance. The RF biasing process results in a lower electrical impedance capsule, a useful by-product of which is that RF condenser microphones can be operated in damp weather conditions that could create problems in DC-biased microphones with contaminated insulating surfaces. The Sennheiser [...] "MKH" [...] series of microphones use the RF biasing technique.|$|E
