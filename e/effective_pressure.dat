25|$|The main {{disadvantages}} of the side-lever engine were {{that it was}} large and heavy, and for inland waterway and coastal service, it was soon replaced by lighter and more efficient designs. It remained the dominant engine type for oceangoing service {{through much of the}} first half of the 19th century however, due to its relatively low centre of gravity which gave ships more stability in heavy seas. It was also a common early engine type for warships, since its relatively low height made it less susceptible to battle damage. From the first Royal Navy steam vessel in 1820 until 1840, 70 steam vessels entered service, the majority with side-lever engines, using boilers set to 4psi maximum pressure. The low steam pressures dictated the large cylinder sizes for the side-lever engines, though the <b>effective</b> <b>pressure</b> on the piston was the difference between the boiler pressure and the vacuum in the condenser.|$|E

The pressure force acting on the parcel is minus the gradient vector of p (in symbols: grad p) - drawn in the figure as a blue arrow.

2500|$|A {{peripheral}} {{intake port}} gives the highest mean <b>effective</b> <b>pressure,</b> however, side intake porting produces a more steady idle, {{because it helps}} to prevent blow-back of burned gases into the intake ducts which cause [...] "misfirings", caused by alternating cycles where the mixture ignites and fails to ignite. Peripheral porting (PP) gives the best mean <b>effective</b> <b>pressure</b> throughout the rpm range, but PP was linked also to worse idle stability and part-load performance. Early work by Toyota led to {{the addition of a}} fresh air supply to the exhaust port, and proved also that a Reed-valve in the intake port or ducts improved the low rpm and partial load performance of Wankel engines, by preventing blow-back of exhaust gas into the intake port and ducts, and reducing the misfire-inducing high EGR, at the cost of a small loss of power at top rpm. David W. Garside, the developer of the Norton rotary engine, who proposed that earlier opening of the intake port before top dead center (TDC), and longer intake ducts, improved low rpm torque and elasticity of Wankel engines. That is also described in Kenichi Yamamoto's books. Elasticity is also improved with a greater rotor eccentricity, analogous to a longer stroke in a reciprocating engine. Wankel engines operate better with a low-pressure exhaust system. Higher exhaust back pressure reduces mean <b>effective</b> <b>pressure,</b> more severely in peripheral intake port engines. The Mazda RX-8 Renesis engine improved performance by doubling the exhaust port area compared with earlier designs, and there has been specific study of the effect of intake and exhaust piping configuration on the performance of Wankel engines.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the event}} of a combat or {{emergency}} situation, the mixture control may be moved to the auto rich position, providing extra fuel to the engine, or in military aircraft, into military position, if the aircraft is so equipped. [...] When in the military position, the Anti-Detonation Injection (ADI) system is activated, injecting the ADI fluid into the engine intake system. [...] The pressure in the ADI system moves the derichment diaphragm in the fuel control to close off the derichment jet, reducing the fuel flow to a leaner mixture which produces higher engine power by raising the mean <b>effective</b> <b>pressure.</b> This causes the cylinder head temperature to increase to a very high level, which dramatically increases the risk of detonation (see: engine knocking). Adding the ADI fluid raises the mean octane level of the charge preventing pre-ignition and also lowers the cylinder temperatures to a more acceptable level. As this operation takes the engine well beyond its normal design limits, this power setting is not suitable for prolonged use. Once the ADI fluid is exhausted or if the mixture control valve is moved out of the military position, the fuel control derichment diaphragm pressure is lost, and the derichment jet is opened once again for normal fuel flow.|$|E
2500|$|Mazda's RX-8 {{car with}} the Renesis engine met California State fuel economy requirements, {{including}} California's low emissions vehicle (LEV) standards. This was achieved {{by a number of}} innovations. The exhaust ports, which in earlier Mazda rotaries were located in the rotor housings, were moved to the sides of the combustion chamber. This solved the problem of the earlier ash buildup in the engine, and thermal distortion problems of side intake and exhaust ports. A scraper seal was added in the rotor sides, and some ceramic parts were used in the engine. This approach allowed Mazda to eliminate overlap between intake and exhaust port openings, while simultaneously increasing the exhaust port area. The side port trapped the unburned fuel in the chamber, decreased the oil consumption, and improved the combustion stability in the low-speed and light load range. The HC emissions from the side exhaust port Wankel engine are 35–50% less than those from the peripheral exhaust port Wankel engine, because of near zero intake and exhaust port opening overlap. Peripheral ported rotary engines have a better mean <b>effective</b> <b>pressure,</b> especially at high rpm and with a rectangular shaped intake port. [...] However, the RX-8 was not improved to meet Euro 5 emission regulations and was discontinued in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The power a Formula One engine {{produces}} {{is generated}} by operating {{at a very high}} rotational speed, up to 15,000 revolutions per minute (rpm).

The basic configuration of a naturally aspirated Formula One engine had not been greatly modified since the 1967 Cosworth DFV and the mean <b>effective</b> <b>pressure</b> had stayed at around 14 bar MEP. Until the mid-1980s Formula One engines were limited to around 12,000 rpm due to the traditional metal valve springs used to close the valves. The speed required to operate the engine valves at a higher rpm called for ever stiffer springs, which increased the power loss to drive the camshaft and the valves {{to the point where the}} loss nearly offset the power gain through the increase in rpm. [...] They were replaced by pneumatic valve springs introduced by Renault, which inherently have a rising rate (progressive rate) that allowed them to have extremely high spring rate at larger valve strokes without much increasing the driving power requirements at smaller strokes, thus lowering the overall power loss. [...] Since the 1990s, all Formula One engine manufacturers used pneumatic valve springs with the pressurised air allowing engines to reach speeds of over 20,000rpm.|$|E

During the loading process of <b>effective</b> confining <b>pressure,</b> the permeability of the mudstone had a nonlinear reduction with increasing stress and showed a high stress sensitivity (varying three orders of magnitude). The phenomenon can be explained that microcrack closure is the dominant mechanism controlling the evolution of mudstone permeability with the <b>effective</b> confining <b>pressure</b> during the loading process. The experimental results indicate that there is good fit of a model with exponential relationship of permeability and <b>effective</b> confining <b>pressure</b> to the data points.

30|$|In the {{compression}} coefficient test, {{the discharge of}} fluids in pores is {{mainly because of the}} compressive deformation of the rock resulting from the gradual increase in <b>effective</b> confining <b>pressure.</b> According to the stress–strain relationship of rocks in compressive test, when the stress loaded on rocks was small, the elastic deformation occurred at first. When the stress gradually rose and exceeded the elastic limit, the plastic deformation occurred and increased with stresses. Therefore, when the maximum <b>effective</b> confining <b>pressure</b> was low, the plastic deformation of the rock was small after each test of compression coefficient. After the reduction in the <b>effective</b> confining <b>pressure,</b> with the recovery of the rock from elastic deformation, there were still many pores. Therefore, the effects of temperature and pore pressure were relatively small. However, when the <b>effective</b> confining <b>pressure</b> is high, the plastic deformation will gradually accumulate with the increase in cycles, so that the pore space of the sample will become smaller and smaller, and the effect of the maximum <b>effective</b> confining <b>pressure</b> on the sample compression coefficient will increase with {{the increase in the number}} of cycles. Therefore, in the process of steam stimulation, the more serious the pressure depletion in every cycle of production, the smaller the elastic energy of the reservoir in the subsequent production process. At the same time, due to plastic deformation is too large, severe pressure depletion will lead to the decrease in porosity and permeability in the later stage of steam stimulation, which is not conducive to the ultimate recovery rate of the oilfield.|$|R
