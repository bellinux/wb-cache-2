The Paris region's manufacturing decline is quickly being replaced by eco-industries: these employ about 100,000 workers. In 2011, while only 56,927 construction workers worked in Paris itself, its metropolitan area employed 246,639, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> centred largely around the Seine-Saint-Denis (41,378) and Hauts-de-Seine (37,303) departments and the new business-park centres appearing there.|$|E
5|$|On 15 February 1959, it was {{organized}} {{to consist of}} the 1st Battle Group, 65th Infantry, {{an element of the}} 92nd Infantry Brigade. On February 21, 1960, commemorated as National Guard Day, the 65th Infantry Regiment was formally transferred from the Regular Army to the PRNG, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> where Gen. Cesár Cordero handed the units colors to Col. Rafael Rodríguez. That same year, Company B of the 65th Regiment created Employer's Day (Día del Patrono in Spanish) where the employer's of the volunteers that serve in the PRNG are instructed about the job that their employees do with the entity and participate in training of their own. The idea behind the initiative was facilitating the processing of the request of leave-of-absence to train for two weeks during the summer. On 1 May 1964, it was reorganized to consist of the 1st Battalion, 65th Infantry, and remained assigned to the 92nd. It was reorganized again on 1 April 1971, to consist of the 1st Battalion and the separate Company E. This was followed by another reorganization on 1 September 1978, to consist of the 1st and 2nd Battalions within the 92nd, as well as the separate Company E. Less than two years later another reorganization on 29 February 1980, eliminated the separate Company E while retaining the 1st and 2nd Battalions.|$|E

5|$|Porpoises {{and other}} smaller cetaceans, mainly dolphins, are hunted <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> known as drive hunting. This is {{accomplished}} by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Porpoises are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, porpoises are mostly hunted for their meat, though some end up in dolphinariums. Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the high methylmercury levels impose, thousands of porpoises are caught in drive hunts each year.|$|E

25|$|Social {{psychological}} {{literature has}} found that the level of motivation one has to engage <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> influences one’s behavior in a group setting. This finding, deemed the collective effort model by Karau and Williams (1993, 2001) details that individuals who are more motivated are {{more likely to engage in}} social facilitation (that is, to increase one’s efforts when in the presence of others) whereas those who are less motivated are more likely to engage in social loafing. Researchers have determined that two factors which determine an individual’s motivation, and subsequently whether or not the individual will resort to social loafing versus social facilitation, include the individual’s expectations about attaining the goal and the perceived value of the goal.|$|E

25|$|It {{was also}} quite {{common in the}} 1980s to use {{physical}} floppy disks and the postal service for spreading software, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> known as mail trading. Prior to the sale of software that came on CD-ROM discs and after hard drives had become available, the software did not require the floppy disc {{to be in the}} drive when starting and using the program. So, a user could install it onto his/her computer and mail the disk to the next person, who could do the same. Particularly widespread in continental Europe, mail trading was even used by many of the leading cracker groups as their primary channel of interaction. Software copyright violation via mail trading was also the most common means for many computer hobbyists in the Eastern bloc countries to receive new Western software for their computers.|$|E

25|$|Brigadier Gen. Kenneth Sweany {{attended}} the summer training in July 1954, expressing satisfaction following the Governor's Day parade that culminated it. On November 19, 1954, the Regular Army formally returned {{the designation of}} 296th Regiment to the PRNG <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> hosted by Muñoz Marín, this under new administrative personnel due to several former members remaining in active service. Detachments were then assigned to several municipalities. The Regiment was able to gather enough troops, but the officers were scarce due to active service and the Inactive Reserve. Other moves included {{the adoption of a}} fighting cock as new insignia and the establishment of a periodical. The efficiency of the personnel was gauged in shooting competitions, with the results being sent back to the USNG for comparison with other national guards. In 1955, a Commission of the House of Representatives supervised the PRNG's exercises to gauge the entity's efficiency. During the passing of Hurricane Santa Clara, the 296th's Company I provided support to the government. The 296th's Engineering Company 225 was tasked with the construction of a bridge.|$|E
25|$|Teleoperated robots, or telerobots, are devices {{remotely}} operated {{from a distance}} by a human operator rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements, but which has semi-autonomous behaviour. They are used when a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous, far away, or inaccessible. The robot may be in another room or another country, or may be on a very different scale to the operator. For instance, a laparoscopic surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery, significantly shortening recovery time. They {{can also be used}} to avoid exposing workers to the hazardous and tight spaces such as in duct cleaning. When disabling a bomb, the operator sends a small robot to disable it. Several authors have been using a device called the Longpen to sign books remotely. Teleoperated robot aircraft, like the Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, are increasingly being used by the military. These pilotless drones can search terrain and fire on targets. Hundreds of robots such as iRobot's Packbot and the Foster-Miller TALON are being used in Iraq and Afghanistan by the U.S. military to defuse roadside bombs or improvised explosive devices (IEDs) <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> known as explosive ordnance disposal (EOD).|$|E
25|$|The Act {{amended the}} INA to add new {{provisions}} enforcing mandatory detention laws. These apply to any alien who {{is engaged in}} terrorism, or who is engaged <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>activity</b> that endangers U.S. national security. It also applies {{to those who are}} inadmissible or who must be deported because it is certified they are attempting to enter to undertake illegal espionage; are exporting goods, technology, or sensitive information illegally; or are attempting to control or overthrow the government; or have, or will have, engaged in terrorist activities. The Attorney General or the Attorney General's deputy may maintain custody of such aliens until they are removed from the U.S., unless it is no longer deemed they should be removed, in which case they are released. The alien can be detained for up to 90 days but can be held up to six months after it is deemed that they are a national security threat. However, the alien must be charged with a crime or removal proceedings start no longer than seven days after the alien's detention, otherwise the alien will be released. However, such detentions must be reviewed every six months by the Attorney General, who can then decide to revoke it, unless prevented from doing so by law. Every six months the alien may apply, in writing, for the certification to be reconsidered. Judicial review of any action or decision relating to this section, including judicial review of the merits of a certification, can be held under habeas corpus proceedings. Such proceedings can be initiated by an application filed with the United States Supreme Court, by any justice of the Supreme Court, by any circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, or by any district court otherwise having jurisdiction to entertain the application. The final order is subject to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Provisions were also made for a report to be required every six months of such decisions from the U.S. Attorney General to the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate.|$|E
