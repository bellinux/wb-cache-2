40|$|SummaryDuring neurogenesis, the {{progression}} from a progenitor cell to a differentiated neuron {{is believed to}} be unidirectional and irreversible. The Rb family of proteins (Rb, p 107, and p 130) regulates cell-cycle exit and differentiation during retinogenesis. Rb and p 130 are redundantly expressed in the neurons of the inner nuclear layer (INL) of the retina. We have found that in the adult Rb;p 130 -deficient retinae p 107 compensation prevents ectopic proliferation of INL neurons. However, p 107 is haploinsufficient in this process. Differentiated Rb−/−;p 107 +/−;p 130 −/− horizontal interneurons re-entered the cell cycle, clonally expanded, and formed metastatic retinoblastoma. Horizontal cells were not affected in Rb+/−;p 107 −/−;p 130 −/− or Rb−/−;p 107 −/−;p 130 +/−, retinae suggesting that one copy of Rb or p 130 was sufficient to prevent <b>horizontal</b> <b>proliferation.</b> We hereby report that differentiated neurons can proliferate and form cancer while maintaining their differentiated state including neurites and synaptic connections...|$|E
40|$|Following its {{election}} in 2007, the Labour government imposed {{a moratorium on}} export of Australian uranium to India. This article argues that with the Indo-US deal and concomitant agreements now in place, Australia should agree to export uranium to India. It does so {{on the grounds that}} the agreements will adequately protect Australian uranium from misuse, will not unduly test the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) regime, could open out oppor-tunities to meet important safety concerns, could help stabilise potentially dangerous vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>proliferation</b> and could also mitigate the region’s burgeoning production of greenhouse gases. In supporting the agreements through nuclear trade with India, however, Australia should use any infl uence it is able to garner thereby to ensure that the Indo-US agreement itself is not seen as part of an attempt on the part of the United States (US), or any other power, to harness India as a means of containing China, and thus exacerbating what could become a destabilising tendency in the region. Important strategic, moral, safety and environmental outcomes hinge on Australia’s decision whether to sell uranium to India. Following Labour’s win in the 2007 Australian national election, Foreign Minister Stephen Smith reversed the previous government’...|$|E
40|$|What is the {{relationship}} between nuclear postures and nonproliferation policies and the spread of nuclear weapons? At first blush, this might appear to be an obvious question. After all, states go to great lengths—extending nuclear security guarantees to nonnuclear weapon states, forward-deploying nuclear weapons on the territory of allies, sizing their own nuclear arsenals with the proliferation decisions of other states in mind, supporting international institutions in conducting inspections of nuclear facilities in nonnuclear weapon states, restricting the availability of sensitive nuclear technology, applying and enforcing sanctions against would-be prolifera-tors, conducting military strikes against nuclear facilities, and promoting nuclear cooperation for peaceful purposes, among many other steps—to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. It would be strange to imagine that states pursue such actions unless they can expect a policy payoff in terms of peace or security. Yet, there is little systematic evidence to suggest that nuclear postures and policies have a mean-ingful impact on the spread of nuclear weapons. Correctly understanding the effects of nuclear posture and policy on both <b>horizontal</b> <b>proliferation</b> (the spread of nuclear weapons to new states) and vertical proliferation (increases in the size and sophistication of nuclear arsenals within existing nuclear states) is a subject of extreme real-world importance.

40|$|Whilst {{developments}} in military hardware receive critical attention {{almost as a}} matter of course, innovations in police technology are only rarely focused upon. In this article an attempt is made to rectify this anomaly by providing a detailed survey of some recent devel-opments in police technologies, as well as directing concern towards the unanticipated consequences associated with their integration into systems of socio-political control. The technology of socio-political control is by definition more or less repressive. Since it appears to offer a flexible solution to many of the problems of internal control, there is a grave danger of its becoming a technological panacea substituted for real political authority when this is absent. Politicians are increasingly prone to hand over their most problematic difficulties to the police or military for solution, only to get them back later in a more intractable form. Consideration is given to the social implications of the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>proliferation</b> of these technologies and their role in effecting the militarization of the society in which they are deployed. The article concludes that new police technologies facilitate the creation and maintenance of totalitarian societies. They pose a real threat to civil liberties and human rights, a threat likely to increase over time. The most repressive forms are currently being transferred to the Third World to service existing systems of cultural imperialism. By frustrating the struggles of the peoples in these countries to obtain a more just and equitable social order, the transfer of political control technology will escalate the processes leading to domestic arms races and thus increase the overall level of violence in the long term. 1...|$|E
40|$|Sea-level rise {{will change}} {{environmental}} conditions on coral reef flats, which comprise extensive habitats in shallow tropical seas and support {{a wealth of}} ecosystem services. Rapid relative sea-level rise of 0. 6  m over a relatively pristine coral reef in Solomon Islands, caused by a subduction earthquake in April 2007, generated {{a unique opportunity to}} examine in situ coral reef response to relative sea-level rise of the magnitude (but not the rate) anticipated by 2100. Extent of live coral was measured from satellite imagery in 2003, 2006, 2009 and 2012. Ecological data were obtained from microatolls and ecological surveys in May 2013. The reef was sampled at 12 locations where dense live hard coral remained absent, remained present or changed from absent to present following subsidence. Ecological data (substratum depth, live coral canopy depth, coral canopy height, substratum suitability, recruitment, diversity and Acropora presence) were measured at each location to identify factors associated with coral response to relative sea-level rise. Vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>proliferation</b> of coral occurred following subsidence. Lateral expansion of live coral, accomplished primarily by branching Acropora spp., resulted in lower diversity in regions which changed composition from pavement to dense live coral following subsidence. Of the ecological factors measured, biotic factors were more influential than abiotic factors; species identity was {{the most important factor in}} determining which regions of the reef responded to rapid sea-level rise. On relatively pristine reef flats under present climatic conditions, rapid relative sea-level rise generated an opportunity for hard coral to proliferate. However, the species assemblage of the existing reef was important in determining response to sea-level change, by providing previously bare substrate with a source of new coral colonies. Degraded reefs with altered species composition and slower coral growth rates may be less able to respond to climate change-induced sea-level changes...|$|E
40|$|Since the mid 1970 s, the {{international}} discussion of nuclear proliferation {{has come into}} a state of flux. Intensive efforts were made in the 1960 s, especially {{on the part of the}} super-powers, to prevent further <b>horizontal</b> <b>proliferation</b> of nuclear weapons via a maintenance of the status quo in the area of strategic nuclear capability. The appropriate means to this end were seen at that time in the renunciation of nuclear weapons construction by non-nuclear weapons states, accompanied by a general freedom in the field of peaceful use of nuclear energy, even with active support and assistance by the nuclear powers. This carefully weighed compromisewas cristallized in 1968 in the form of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). The USA have commented on this treaty: "In the history of international diplomacy it is hard to recall a treaty more painstakingly negotiated, in due recognition of the interests of so many governments and of its worldwide impact and importance. " / 1 / In the following years the Treaty was ratified by more than one hundred countries. A satisfactory consolidation became thus apparent in a situation generally recognized within {{the international}} community as being very threatening. Five years after the coming into force of the NPT, however, this development was to obtain a new direction which would basically call into question the consensus that had been achieved with such great difficulty. The initiation for this turn of events was, above all, the nuclear explosive test by India in 1974. Although India had not ratified the NPT, Canada, Australia and above all, the United States took this explosion as grounds for a reappraisal of the consensus expressed in the NPT. As a result of this re-thinking in the interest of strengthened proliferation resistance, the dividinq line for non-nuclear weapons stateswas no langer to be drawn between peaceful and military use of nuclear energy but rather within the field of peaceful application itself, at that Point where a potential military misuse becomes possible. This is to apply [ [...] . ...|$|E

This article investigates the factors constraining North Korea's further integration into the Northeast Asian region and the implications of the maturation of its nuclear weapons program for regional security. These findings suggest that North Korea's doctrine of simultaneous nuclear weapons and economic development heralds the end of regional denuclearisation politics, which in turn is shaping the nature and extent of North Korea's integration into Northeast Asia. North Korea's nuclear gambit and the failure of regional states to adjust to North Korea as a nuclear weapons power may increase the danger of conflict escalation and expanded regional <b>horizontal</b> nuclear <b>proliferation.</b> Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|We report {{two cases}} of eruptive {{tumors of the}} {{follicular}} infundibulum (TFI) with an unusual clinical presentation {{which has not been}} described previously in literature. In both cases, the appearance was strikingly similar, consisting of multiple asymptomatic hypopigmented macules on the buttocks of two Black African males, aged 38 and 55 years old. In both cases, the eruption had evolved over several months. The individual lesions were of similar size, approximately 1 cm, with irregular and ill-defined borders. Histopathological examination revealed a superficial and <b>horizontal</b> plate-like <b>proliferation</b> of keratinocytes emanating from the epidermis with multiple slender attachments. Pale keratinocytes were present within the epithelial plates. A Fontana stain showed a loss of melanin pigment from the epithelial plates. Orcein (elastic) stain highlighted an increase of the number of the elastic fibers surrounding the tumor. On the basis of these findings, a diagnosis of eruptive TFI was established for both cases. Among the various presentations of TFI, only the eruptive variant appears to be clinically distinctive, with asymptomatic hypopigmented macules usually located on the face, neck and upper trunk. Eruptive TFI should also be added to the clinical differential diagnosis of multiple hypopigmented macules on the buttocks of Black patients. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the significant role that the nuclear powers have had in the development of India's nuclear capabilities, particularly the part played by the United States. The period that was covered goes from 1947 to 1974, and it was examined by dividing it into three phases. The first includes the origins of the nuclear program, the political and historical causes which have created the conditions for the development of the project, and the aspects that allowed the technical cooperation with other countries, especially with the United States of America. The second goes through the negotiations from 1965 onwards, which led in 1968 to the Indian decision not to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, examining, in particular, the internal debate at first on the search for security guarantees from both sides: the Western countries and the Soviet Union, later on by requesting a global nuclear disarmament. The last phase leads to the first Indian nuclear test in 1974, where the research analyses the implications on the international arena, as an introduction to the stalemate that has characterized the next phase. Possessing nuclear weapons has always been considered a way to achieve an international status. In the case of India the proliferation was generated both by endemic situations of conflict and by the need of a stronger affirmation of its national identity. The Republic of India wanted to be recognized as a country able to play an important role on the international scene and among the non-aligned countries. Unfortunately Indian’s nuclear test damaged the credibility of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as it was the first country to challenge directly, deliberately and with apparent impunity, the central aim of the treaty. In this way other countries could feel encouraged to follow Indian’s example. That was exactly what the United States and the Soviet Union feared the most: in the early sixties as the <b>horizontal</b> <b>proliferation</b> constituted a greater risk of nuclear war. A local conflict could have triggered a "domino effect" eventually involving the two superpowers, with catastrophic consequences. At the same time, the United States in the sixties, had considered the possibility to encourage and help India in acquiring unconventional weapons in an "anti-Chinese" function and continued to supply enriched uranium after its first nuclear test. One conclusion was that, even if fearing the possible repercussions on the countries of the so-called Third World and despite the damage to the image of the NPT, the first Indian nuclear test was considered by the United States a peripheral event in the years of "appeasement". We could argue that, since India was not part of the NPT, no penalties could have been applied, but nuclear powers could have imposed disguised penalties if they had wanted to. India was a country with a strategic role because of its size and population and a point of reference in Asia, even more after the fall of Vietnam, which is the reason why Washington decided not to react harshly to its “horizontal proliferation”. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} the Courts in ensuring that human rights that exist on paper are ‘practical and effective’ in application. The author conducts this examination by considering the important role {{of the rule of law}} in the application of human rights. The author argues that the written law, which enshrines human rights, only becomes legally enforceable if there exists a functioning and proper government structure. That structure includes an independent and impartial judiciary which is capable of ensuring proper implementation of the rule of law. In a democracy governed by the rule of law, the government is also bound by the law and that law contains safeguards protecting everyone’s individual freedoms. The author sets out five developments which explain the great increase in the importance of fundamental rights in recent years - <b>proliferation,</b> <b>horizontal</b> effect, internationalisation and a broadening of perspective. The final part of the paper takes two topics which emanate from consideration of the first of these five developments, proliferation. The first topic is the scope for a national approach versus European uniformity and the second is the difference between destructive and constructive criticism of the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. This paper concludes by again underlining the important role of the rule of law in ensuring government accountability and the implementation of human rights and argues that because of the acceptance by national Courts of the aforementioned developments, those Courts are better prepared to interpret human rights in the modern world...|$|R
