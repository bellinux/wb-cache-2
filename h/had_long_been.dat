Many Catholics and recent immigrants favored McKinley because of the dislike the American Protective Association had for him.|$|E

5|$|It <b>had</b> <b>long</b> <b>been</b> Markham's {{practice}} {{to take note}} of promising young naval officers who might later be suitable for polar responsibilities, should the opportunity arise.
