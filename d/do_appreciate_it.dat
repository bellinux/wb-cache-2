The fact is, I'm too old to change so radically. If you don't like my saying that, then you are, Isabel, and so are the children. I've no right to take them from the home we've made, and to change the whole course of their lives, unless I can assure them of something, and I can't assure them of anything.

We have navigation, recognition of aircraft at 1 / 75 of a second, communications, which includes Morse code at 12 words a minute, blinker code at 10 and Semaphore at 8. Also Principles of Flight, Aerology [sic], Aircraft Engines, and to top that off we have military drill and physical training. This makes a very complete day in any man’s life. But we are lucky.

Things have speeded up since this war started and they are rushing us right through. I am through ground school and in my advanced squadron as well as Ben Scuda who has gone to Miami for his advanced training in fighters. If everything goes the way it should from now on I should receive my commission around the first of July. I could write forever telling you about the south and this base and what I think about them so I’ll try to hit a few high spots just in case you are interested. There are six swimming pools on the base and three movie houses, tennis courts, horseback riding, golf driving range, archery range, bowling alleys and a cadet club where cadets can bring guests to drink and dance. That’s the sports and social angle. A cadet goes through three squadrons before he enters his final one in which he will receive instruction in the work he will actually do on active duty. Ground School is a pretty stiff course especially the navigation subjects. There are cadets washing out every week either for failure in ground school or for flying. Roy Smith had some tough luck but I hope he will like his work in the Army. There are about 1500 cadets here and many more enlisted men and marines in a boot camp here also. The base here is so large we travel around in busses from one place to another. As for the south well you can have it, possibly {{it would be nice to}} spend a week or so down here but for a home I’ll take the good old north. The heat here takes all the pep right out of you. Well that isn’t very much but you’ll have a faint idea what it’s like down here. It’s very nice of the Bryant Service Club to send things to its men in the service and I’m sure they will all appreciate it. Bryant should be proud of Al Stanwood and his encounter with the Japs. Once again I want to thank you for the cigarettes. I sure <b>do</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>it.</b> I have been promoted to a Sub Commander and I am now in a new room in the same building.
