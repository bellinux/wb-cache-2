The factory makes good quality men's shoes, {{but they are not}} stylish and not cheap, and the market <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> drying up. Charlie is {{determined}} to save the factory and his father's legacy, though he has no desire to run Price & Sons himself. The workers, many of whom have known Charlie his entire life, do not understand why Charlie had moved away in the first place, and many are hostile and skeptical of the new management.|$|E

Numerous copies of this design were made during the late 19th century in Belgium, with smaller numbers also produced in Spain, France and the USA. They remained reasonably popular until the Second World War, but are now generally sought after only as collectors' pieces, since ammunition <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> for the most part no longer commercially manufactured.|$|E

Outside of that, a prolonged antibiotic regimen lasting more than 28 days is not recommended as no clinical evidence shows it to be effective.

25|$|Sucking on {{the nipple}} offsets {{the fall in}} {{prolactin}} as the internal stimulus <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> removed. The sucking activates mechanoreceptors {{in and around the}} nipple. These signals are carried by nerve fibers through the spinal cord to the hypothalamus, where changes in the electrical activity of neurons that regulate the pituitary gland increase prolactin secretion. The suckling stimulus also triggers the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary gland, which triggers milk let-down: Prolactin controls milk production (lactogenesis) but not the milk-ejection reflex; the rise in prolactin fills the breast with milk in preparation for the next feed.|$|E

25|$|The episcopate of Henry Phillpotts (1830–1869) was {{a period}} of great Anglican {{activity}} with the establishment of many new parishes and parish churches and the first unsuccessful attempts to recreate a Cornish diocese. The county remained within the Diocese of Exeter until 1876 when the Anglican Diocese of Truro was created (the first Bishop was appointed in 1877). Roman Catholicism was virtually extinct in Cornwall after the 17th century except for a few families such as the Arundells of Lanherne. From the mid-19th century the church reestablished episcopal sees in England, one of these being at Plymouth. Since then immigration to Cornwall has brought more Roman Catholics into the population. Religious houses have been established at several locations including Bodmin, and Roman Catholic churches have been built where the need <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> apparent.|$|E
25|$|After {{an initial}} period of confusion, the four {{travellers}} find {{they have been}} transported forward in time to just {{before the end of}} the universe. They are in Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, which was built on the ruins of Magrathea. So, as Arthur says, they have travelled through time but not through space. Waiting <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> Marvin the depressed robot, whom they left on Magrathea 40 million years ago. He's now an attendant at the car park, and still depressed. Just before the universe ends, Zaphod and Ford get Marvin to help them steal a supercool all-black spaceship, which turns out to be the property of a very loud rock band called Disaster Area. The episode ends on the cliff-hanger as the black ship is about to start a dive into the sun of Kakrafoon.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{the annual}} global harvest of edible {{jellyfish}} {{was estimated to}} be around 321,000 metric tons. The most prominent countries involved in edible jellyfish production are Burma, China, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. In China, jellyfish larvae are reared in ponds before being released as juveniles into the sea to grow and mature. In Southeast Asia, edible species of jellyfish may be harvested using various nets such as drift nets, scoop nets, set nets and hand nets, hooks and beach seines. In 2001, the estimated annual catch in Southeast Asia in net weight was at around 169,000 metric tons. The amount of jellyfish caught annually in this region can vary significantly, and the fishing season <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> relatively short, at two to four months.|$|E

25|$|The market {{mechanism}} {{for agricultural products}} is not particularly developed given the traditional nature of the agricultural sector and the numerous governmental interventions in the market prices. The market mainly consists {{of a large number}} of retail traders who purchase the crops from the farmers in small quantities and bring them to the major traders in the bazaar, which is the system that was the predecessor to the modern markets. In order to improve market efficiency and transparency, the Iranian government has allowed trading of agricultural products on the Iran Mercantile Exchange (IME) for the past seven years. More than 22 different agricultural products are currently traded on the IME and the trading volume <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> approximately 200,000 tonnes per annum. Nonetheless, given the direct impact of the prices of agricultural products on people’s daily lives and welfare, the government actively intervenes in the market by setting prices, importing products in large amounts, subsidising certain products, and restricting exports in order to supply domestic demand.|$|E

In March 2004, a small breeding herd of Sorraia horses was released on the estate of a private land owner who dedicated {{a portion of his}} property so that these horses could live completely wild, as did their ancestors.

Gleason writing in January 1968: [...] "The Beach Boys, when they were a reflection of an actuality of American society (i.e., Southern California hot rod, surfing and beer-bust fraternity culture), made music that had vitality and interest.
