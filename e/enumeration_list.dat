5000|$|While {{very popular}} in the 1980s and early 1990s, {{implementations}} of Pascal that closely followed Wirth's initial definition of the language were widely criticized for being unsuitable for use outside teaching. Brian Kernighan, who popularized the C language, outlined his most notable criticisms of Pascal as early as 1981, in his paper Why Pascal Is Not My Favorite Programming Language. The most serious problem described in his article was that array sizes and string lengths {{were part of the}} type, so {{it was not possible to}} write a function that would accept variable length arrays or even strings as parameters. This made it unfeasible to write, for example, a sorting library. The author also criticized the unpredictable order of evaluation of boolean expressions, poor library support, and lack of static variables, and raised a number of smaller issues. Also, he stated that the language did not provide any simple constructs to [...] "escape" [...] (knowingly and forcibly ignore) restrictions and limitations. More general complaints from other sources noted that the scope of declarations was not clearly defined in the original language definition, which sometimes had serious consequences when using forward declarations to define pointer types, or when record declarations led to mutual recursion, or when an identifier may or may not have been used in an <b>enumeration</b> <b>list.</b> Another difficulty was that, like ALGOL 60, the language did not allow procedures or functions passed as parameters to predefine the expected type of their parameters.|$|E

This renders identification of the species difficult after the normal frustules cleaning procedures, which removes organic material during acid cleaning and mounting, leading to misidentification of the genus as Thallassiosira spp. (Hasle and Syvertsen 1997). Two species—P. sol and P. blanda find ephemeral mention in <b>enumeration</b> <b>lists</b> of different publications from the Indian Sundarbans (Manna et al. 2010; Biswas et al. 2010; Mukherjee et al. 2013).

The present work gives attention to the morphometry and taxonomy of the two species along with an analysis of the changing ecological dynamics in terms of seasonal data as well as an analysis of their temporal factsheets obtained as secondary data.|$|R

40|$|The New York City {{neighborhood}} of Harlem has mortality rates that {{are among the}} highest in the United States. In absolute numbers, cardiovascular disease and cancer account for the overwhelming majority of deaths, especially among men, and these deaths occur at relatively young ages. The aim of this research was to examine self-reported smoking habits according to measures of socioeconomic status among Harlem men and women, in order to estimate the contribution of tobacco consumption to Harlem's remarkably high excess mortality. During 1992 - 1994, in-person interviews were conducted among 695 Harlem adults aged 18 - 65 years who were randomly selected from dwelling unit <b>enumeration</b> <b>lists.</b> The self-reported prevalence of current smoking was strikingly high among both men (48 %) and women (41 %), even among highly educated men (38 %). The 2 1 % of respondents without working telephones reported an even higher prevalence of current smoking (61 %), indicating that national and state-based estimates which rely on telephone surveys may seriously underestimate the prevalence of smoking in poor urban communities. Among persons aged 35 - 64 years, the smoking attributable fractions for selected causes of death were larger in Harlem than in either New York City as a whole or the entire United States for both men and women. Tobacco consumption is likely to be one of several important mediators of the high numbers of premature deaths in Harlem.

With similar ideas, we also show that finding a minimum weighted maximal independent set in a chordal graph is NP-hard, and even hard to approximate...|$|R

In distributed computing, algorithms with sublinear round complexity for triangle finding and listing have recently been developed in the powerful CONGEST clique model, where communication is allowed between any two nodes of the network. In this paper we present the first algorithms with sublinear complexity for triangle finding and triangle listing in the standard CONGEST model, where the communication topology is the same as the topology of the network. More precisely, we give randomized algorithms for triangle finding and listing with round complexity O(n^ 2 / 3 (n) ^ 2 / 3) and O(n^ 3 / 4 n), respectively, where n denotes the number of nodes of the network. We also show a lower bound Ω(n^ 1 / 3 / n) on the round complexity of triangle listing, which also holds for the CONGEST clique model. Comment: To appear in PODC 201...|$|R

Since one peculiar property of biological networks is the uncertainty, a scenario in which enumeration algorithms can be helpful is biological network analysis. Modelling biological networks indeed introduce bias: arc dependencies are neglected and underlying hyper-graph behaviours are forced in simple graph representations to avoid intractability. Moreover regulatory interactions between all the biological networks are omitted, even if none of the different biological layers is truly isolated. Last but not least, the dynamical behaviours of biolog-ical networks are often not considered: indeed most of the currently available biological network reconstructions are potential networks, where all the possible connections are indicated, even if edges/arcs and vertices are hardly present all together at the same time.

Health management information system (HMIS) is facility-based and does not give a picture based on the community. To assess the performance of community social development programs, social sector workers and managers routinely monitoring their activities using simplified methods. This presentation will highlight how Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) addresses this problem. LQAS is an analysis method that can be used locally in supervision areas to identify priority areas; those not reaching an established performance benchmark for an indicator, measure coverage at an aggregate level (e. g., program catchment area or district or national level), to generate data to inform management decision making; and for sharing information across supervision areas and for reporting purposes. LQAS uses small samples; most frequently used size is 19 per Supervision area. Larger sizes are seldom needed. This methodology works by division of district into 5 or more supervision areas, random selection of 19 locations for interview within each supervision area using the population census village / <b>enumeration</b> area <b>lists,</b> training the district program team members in LQAS, field Work (data collection), hand tabulation and data analysis and finally dissemination of LQAS survey results and implementation of strategic decisions for program improvement.

40|$|The {{so-called}} {{dual system}} estimator (DSE) {{is a standard}} capture-recapture method for census under-count assessment. However, there are many situations where the <b>list</b> <b>enumerations</b> also suffer from over-counting (i. e. erroneous enumeration). The standard DSE is then biased in such situations. In this chapter we propose and study a trimmed dual system estimator (TDSE) {{that can be used}} to explore, reduce and potentially remove, the bias of the standard DSE in the presence of erroneous enumeration. It is shown that, as long as the trimming is more effective at picking out erroneous records than simple random sampling, and that one does not trim more than the actual number of erroneous records, the TDSE can be expected to be less biased than the naïve DSE that overlooks the erroneous enumerations. Diagnostics are provided for the stopping rule, i. e. when to stop the trimming. The approach is applied in a project at CSO, Ireland, to produce population counts from administrative data sources. Such population counts will provide a critical first step for countries without a Central Population Register to transition from a traditional Census model to one based on administrative data sources...|$|R
