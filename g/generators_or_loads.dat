40|$|Incremental {{transmission}} loss analysis {{has been used}} for decades, but recent interest in its application to loss allocation calls for new in-depth results. This paper demonstrates that, for incremental methods to be applied correctly in loss allocation, it is first necessary to specify the load distribution and loss supply strategies. Incremental loss allocation among bus power injections is shown to be arbitrary and, therefore, open to challenge as discriminatory. Loss allocation is possible among incremental loads and/or generators, but the proportion of the total losses assigned to either one is arbitrary. Unique, nonarbitrary incremental loss allocations are however possible among the "equivalent" incremental bilateral exchanges between generators and loads. From these basic components it is possible then to calculate the allocation among <b>generators</b> <b>or</b> <b>loads</b> in any specified proportion.

Previously, electrical power systems have been analysed to provide theoretical fault levels values for different zones of an electrical power distribution system based upon a worse case scenario. However, existing electrical loads will in practice provide a more adaptable and higher fault level. By monitoring and identifying an I-V characteristic upon switching electrical load in practical operation an actual default level at particular nodes in a power distribution system is determinable. In such circumstances decisions with regard to the connectablilty of further electrical <b>generators</b> <b>or</b> <b>loads</b> at particular parts and zones of an electrical power distribution system can be quantified by reference to the actual fault level rather than the theoretical worse case scenario level and therefore avoid unnecessary upgrading of transmission equipment or denying access to the electrical power system...|$|E

30|$|Numerous {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on power system reliability evaluation models and indices, such as the loss of load probability, loss of load expectation, and expected energy not supplied [14, 15, 16, 17]. At present, the tracing technique has been applied to trace power flow [18, 19, 20], {{as well as in the}} unreliability of general complex networks, generation systems, and BPS [21, 22, 23, 24]. The power tracing method allows the assessment of the contributions of individual <b>generators</b> (<b>or</b> <b>loads)</b> to individual line flows, which often utilize sensitivity analysis. This method can determine the relation between generator/load nodes and transmission lines in a power network and verify changes in the line flow along with the change in nodal generation/demand. Thus, the weak parts of a system can be recognized according to the change value [18, 19, 20]. For reliability tracing, the key components that cause unreliability are obtained according to reliability principles, that is, the failed component sharing principle (FCSP) and proportional sharing principle (PSP), and the reliability tracing results are the direct contribution of the weak parts to risks [21, 22, 23, 24]. Both the sensitivity analysis and reliability tracing method can be used to recognize the key components that cause risk. Compared with sensitivity analysis, some of the advantages of the reliability tracing method are as follows.|$|E

Variable speed wind turbines and other low-carbon <b>generators</b> <b>or</b> <b>loads</b> that are connected through inverters do not inherently contribute to the inertia of AC grids. A coordinated control scheme for frequency support from multi-terminal VSC-HVDC (MTDC) scheme was designed to transfer additional power to AC grids from the kinetic energy stored in the wind turbine rotating mass and the active power transferred from other AC systems. The wind turbine inertia response limited {{the rate of change}} of AC grid frequency and the active power transferred from the other AC system reduced the frequency deviation. The wind turbines recovered back to their original speed after their inertia response and transferred a recovery power to the AC grid. An alternative coordinated control scheme with a frequency versus active power droop controller was designed for frequency support from MTDC schemes, in order to transfer the recovery power of wind turbines to other AC systems. This prevented a further drop of frequency on the AC grid. The effectiveness of the alternative coordinated control scheme was verified using the PSCAD simulation tool and demonstrated using an experimental test rig. A scaling method was demonstrated for a multi-terminal DC test rig to represent the equivalent steady state operation of different VSC-HVDC systems. The method uses a virtual resistance to extend the equivalent DC cable resistance of the test rig through the action of an additional DC voltage versus DC current droop controller. Three different VSC-HDC systems were modelled using the PSCAD simulation tool and demonstrated on the DC test rig with virtual resistance, showing good agreement...|$|E
40|$|Restrictions on {{expansion}} of traditional centralized generating and delivery systems may be becoming so tight {{in the industrialized}} countries that they cannot reasonably be expected meet future electricity demand growth at acceptable cost. Meanwhile, technological advances, notably improved power electronics that permit grid interconnection of asynchronous generation sources, is tilting the economics of power generation back towards smaller scales, thereby reversing a century long trend towards the central control paradigm. Special power quality requirements or opportunities for {{combined heat and power}} applications make on-site generation an even more attractive option for customers. The existence of a significant amount of electricity sources dispersed throughout the low voltage distribution system could create a power system quite different to the one we are familiar with and creating it offers significant research and engineering challenges. Moreover, the electrical and economic relationships between customers and the distribution utility and among customers may take forms quite distinct from those we know today. For example, rather than devices being individually interconnected in parallel with the grid, they may be grouped with loads in a semi-autonomous neighborhood that could be termed a microgrid. A microgrid is a cluster of small (by the standards of current power systems, e. g. < 500 kW) sources, storage systems, and loads which presents itself to the grid as a legitimate single entity. The heart of the microgrid concept is the notion of a flexible, yet controllable electronic interface between the microgrid and the familiar wider power system, or macrogrid. This interface essentially isolates the two sides electrically; and yet connects them economically by allowing delivery and receipt of electrical energy and ancillary services (EE&AS) at the interface. From the customer side of the interface, the microgrid should appear as an autonomous power system meeting the power quality and reliability requirements of the customer. Such issues as local voltage, reliability, losses and quality of power should be those that support the customers' objectives. From the macrogrid side, however, the microgrid should appear as a legitimate entity akin to current interconnected <b>generators</b> <b>or</b> <b>loads.</b> A key distinction between microgrids and our familiar arrangements is the expanded role of electricity endusers in determining the pattern of development of the overall power system, which must not only accommodate purchases and sales of EE&AS to and from established markets but also contractual agreements between microgrids. Fundamentally, the characteristics and capabilities of the microgrid will be determined by its internal requirements together with the technical, economic, and regulatory opportunities and constraints it faces, and not by established objectives for capacity expansion and reliability of the macrogrid. The goal of Consortium for Electric Reliability Technology Solutions (CERTS) work underway at the Berkeley Lab is to anticipate possible patterns of microgrid development that can help focus research efforts on the key technical problems that must be solved to enable microgrid deployment...|$|E

Power system {{stability is}} defined as the condition of a power system that enables it to remain in a state of operating equilibrium under normal operating conditions and to regain an acceptable state of equilibrium after being subjected to a finite disturbance. In the evaluation of stability, {{the focus is on the}} behavior of the power system when subjected to both large and small disturbances. Large disturbances are caused by severe changes in the power system, e. g. a short-circuit on a transmission line, loss of a large <b>generator</b> <b>or</b> <b>load,</b> loss of a tie-line between two systems. Small disturbances in the form of load changes take place continuously requiring the system to adjust to the changing conditions. The system should be capable of operating satisfactorily under these conditions and successfully supplying the maximum amount ofload. This dissertation deals with the use of Power System Stabilizers (PSS) to damp electromechanical oscillations arising from small disturbances. In particular, it focuses on three issues associated with the damping of these oscillations. These include ensuring robustness of PSS under changing operating conditions, maintaining or selecting the structure of the PSS and coordinating multiple PSS to ensure global power system robustness...|$|R

Considering {{the multiplicity of}} the distributed resources in a single location and distributed nature of such single entities, it is impractical to represent them as detailed models in power system simulations. Hence, it will be attractive for electricity utilities to employ simplified models of microgrids in dynamic studies. This paper proposes a method for representing grid-tied microgrids as simplified <b>generator</b> <b>or</b> <b>load</b> units in such studies. For this purpose, the paper takes an approach in investigating the applicability of modal analysis {{as a tool for}} model equivalencing of grid-tied microgrids with inverter and non-inverter interfaced distributed generators. Validity of the reduced order dynamic equivalents is tested under different operating conditions: power export and import modes, with different load types and fault conditions. Scalability of the model equivalencing approach is demonstrated using a case study developed based on the IEEE 13 -Bus test feeder. Furthermore, the model equivalencing is applied on microgrids in a multi-microgrid environment to validate the methodology. The dynamic model equivalent of the microgrid can be represented as a current source at the point of common coupling while retaining all imperative dynamic characteristics.

40|$|Abstract – This paper first {{proposes a}} {{competitive}} market structure for reactive power procurement and then develops a methodology for incorporating voltage stability problems into the model. The owners of electric transactions should participate in this competitive framework and submit their own firmness bids in ($/MW) to the Independent System/Market Operator (ISO-IMO). ISO clears the market for reactive energy regarding the value of each transaction and utilization cost of reactive power on one hand, {{and the impact of}} transaction amount on the voltage security of the power system on the other hand. Here, the voltage stability margin is incorporated into the power flow equations so that the security of the power system is provided when a sudden change in load occurs. Applying the Karush- Kuhn-Tuker theorem to the proposed OPF-based reactive power market model gives the reactive power to be provided at each generation node and amount of each bilateral transaction allowed for physical operation. To illustrate an interesting feature of the proposed methodology, several case studies are carried out over the IEEE 14 -bus test system using the well-known GAMS software (MINOS solver).

40|$|Power blackouts are a {{recurring}} problem worldwide, {{and research in}} this area continues to focus on developing improved methods for their prediction and prevention. Controlled islanding has been proposed as a last resort action to save the network before imminent blackouts when the usual means fail in an unexpected manner. Successful controlled islanding has to deal with three important issues that are involved in the implementation of islanding: when to island, where to island and what to do after islanding is implemented in each island. This thesis presents a framework that combines all three issues to achieve successful islanding based on wide area measurement systems (WAMS). In addition, this thesis focuses on the question of when to island. This question is {{critical to the success of}} the three-stage controlled islanding scheme because the possible issues of false dismissal and false alarm have to be handled. In false dismissal, islanding is triggered too late. However, the potentially unstable system is still allowed to operate, and this unstable system, which could have survived, may cause uncontrolled cascading blackouts. In false alarm, islanding is triggered too early, and an originally stable system is forced to split into islands, resulting in unnecessary disruption and economic loss. Thus, the early recognition and identification of “the point of no return” before blackout is inevitable. The single machine equivalent (SIME) method is adopted online to predict transient stability during cascading outages that would shortly lead to blackouts, giving support in decisions about when to island in terms of transient instability. SIME also evaluates dynamic stability after islanding and ensures that the selected island candidates are stable before action is taken. Moreover, in this thesis, the power flow tracing-based method provides all possible islanding cutsets, and SIME helps to identify the one that has the best transient stability and minimal power flow disruption. If no possible island cut set exists, corrective actions through tripping critical <b>generators</b> <b>or</b> <b>load</b> shedding are undertaken in each island.

40|$|The {{reliable}} operation of microgrids {{can be achieved}} by properly sharing the load demand among available generators within microgrids. The load sharing depends on the types of energy sources and characteristics of microgrids where most of these energy sources are based on renewable power generation. The grid integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) increases the uncertainties as the power generation from RESs heavily relies on the natural resources (sun light, wind speed) which are unpredictable. In such cases, load sharing becomes more challenging as the reliability of the grid degrades. Moreover, microgrids are low- or medium-voltage networks which have resistive transmission lines and their generators are distributed throughout the network which creates complexities and reduces the accuracy of load sharing. A proper load-sharing control technique is necessary to enhance the reliability of a microgrid system. In this thesis, the effect of renewable energy penetration is analysed and two different techniques for load sharing in microgrids with RESs, which overcome the limitations of the techniques in the existing literature for improving sharing accuracy, are proposed. In the first technique proposed in this thesis, a central power management unit and local controllers work together to share the load of a microgrid with its available generators. The central control unit is able to estimate the load deviations for each node centrally by using node voltages. This control scheme considers both resistive and inductive transmission lines and works well in a microgrid environment with RESs. Simulation results show that load-sharing errors from this technique are negligible and all node voltages are within the permissible limits. The second approach is a decentralised control technique which works without any central controller and introduces a new term called demand factor to calculate the load demand for each generator. The benefit of using the demand factor is that each controllable generator can calculate the load demand itself without communicating with other <b>generators</b> <b>or</b> <b>load</b> centres. Only a very low-bandwidth one-way communication link is needed if the system contains a battery for utilising the maximum power from RESs. Simulation results show that the load-sharing performance of this control scheme is reasonably good and maintains the system voltage within permissible limits...|$|R

However, with the expansion of system scales, to obtain parameters of all system devices becomes harder than before. Moreover, {{it is very difficult to}} ensure computational convergence and accuracy when calculating the modes and mode-shapes of a large system. Recent years, enormous progresses have been made in measurement-based oscillation analysis because of the rapid development of wide-area measurement system (WAMS). In identifying oscillation properties, the characteristics of waveforms in different oscillation period were analyzed in [8]. Reference [9] focused on the initial period of the waveforms, proposing a second order differential method. The oscillation properties were discriminated according to the components of power response in [10]. Reference [11] decomposed the energy supply on port (ESP) and discriminated the oscillation properties according to the features of ESP’s aperiodic component. As for the oscillation source locating, the concept of generator energy was firstly introduced and successfully used to identify the generator where the external disturbance exists in [15]. Further, [16, 17, 18] proposed the concept of energy flow in the network, based on which the oscillation sources could be located correctly on a <b>generator</b> <b>or</b> a <b>load</b> bus.

40|$|Renewable energy sources, {{particularly}} solar energy, play a {{vital role}} for generating environment-friendly electricity. Foremost advantages of solar energy sources are: nonpolluting, free in terms of availability and renewable. The renewable green-energy sources are becoming more cost-effective and sustainable substitutes to conventional fossil fuels. Nonetheless, power generation from Photovoltaic (PV) systems is unpredictable due to its reliance on meteorological conditions. The effective use of this fluctuating solar energy source obliges reliable and robust forecast information for management and operation of a contemporary power grid. Due to the remarkable proliferation of solar power generation, the prediction of solar power yields becomes more and more imperative. Large-scale penetration of solar power in the electricity grid provides numerous challenges to the grid operator, mainly due to the intermittency of the sun. Since the power produced by a PV depends decisively on the unpredictability of the sun, unexpected variations of a PV output may increase operating costs for the electricity system as well as set potential threats to the reliability of electricity supply. Nevertheless, the prediction accuracy level of the existing prediction methods for solar power is not up to the mark that is very much required to deal with the forthcoming sophisticated and advanced power grid like Smart Grid. Therefore, accurate solar power prediction methods become very substantial. The main goal of this thesis is to produce a novel hybrid prediction method for more accurate, reliable and robust solar power prediction using modern Computational Intelligence (CI). The hybrid prediction method which is mainly composed of multiple regressive machine learning techniques will be as accurate and reliable as possible, to accommodate the needs of any future systems that depend upon it for <b>generator</b> <b>or</b> <b>load</b> scheduling, <b>or</b> grid stability control applications. In this thesis, research on the experimental analysis and development of hybrid machine learning for solar power prediction has been presented. The thesis makes the following major contributions: 1) It investigates heterogeneous machine learning techniques for hybrid prediction methods for solar power 2) It applies feature selection methods to individually improve the prediction accuracy of previous machine learning techniques 3) It investigates possible parameter optimisation of computational intelligence techniques to make sure that individual predictions are as accurate as possible 4) It proposes hybrid prediction by non-linearly integrating the discrete prediction results from various machine-learning techniques. Performance characteristics of the hybrid machine learning over individuals was carried out through experimental analysis and the results are justified by various statistical tests and error validation metrics which confirmed the maximum achievable accuracy of the developed hybrid method for solar power prediction.
