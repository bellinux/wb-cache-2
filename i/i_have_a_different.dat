2500|$|... "Inner Child" [...] was {{the first}} episode to air after a two-month hiatus. It was delayed by about 30 minutes because American Idol ran long for the night. The episode won its ad-hoc 9:30–10:30 Eastern timeslot, with about 9.6 million live viewers and a 9 share among viewers 18–49. Fringe also helped Fox win the night in total number of viewers. When asked by a {{reporter}} if he was [...] "infuriated" [...] with Fox because of the Idol-induced delay, co-creator J.J. Abrams replied [...] "I will say that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> opinion about the network, but I, too, have heard {{from a number of}} people [...] It is infuriating".|$|E
2500|$|Of her return, Budig {{said the}} reason she {{decided to take the}} offer was because of timing. She stated that her life is in Los Angeles, and that ABC did a lot to make the {{transition}} easier for her. Viewers reasoned that Singh's treatment by ABC was not Budig's fault, since she had been approached by Frons himself and could not have known exactly what would transpire in the upcoming weeks. When asked of Singh, Budig praised her work but seemed aware of how the writers had altered Greenlee's character and of the audience's dissatisfaction with the change; in response to this, she hinted that this issue would not be the case with her return. [...] "I think [...] brought in a different perspective on the character," [...] she said. [...] "Obviously, I played this character for six years and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> take on Greenlee." ...|$|E

5000|$|Carrigan {{is largely}} {{responsible}} for establishing the [...] "big fat drum sound" [...] associated with Nashville recordings during the 1970s. He said: [...] "I started playing real loose, deep-sounding snare drums on country records. Billy Sherrill loved it. So I started experimenting with different things, different kinds of drums. I bought {{the first set of}} concert tom-toms that were in Nashville. I think that's one reason the producers liked my sound. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> approach." ...|$|R
2500|$|Oppewall {{said of her}} career, [...] "What I do for {{a living}} is not {{dissimilar}} from what an actor does. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> set of tools, but it's the same process. The reason that it's fun to design sets is that it allows you to try on personalities that you'd never otherwise experience." [...] Gary Ross, director of Pleasantville and Seabiscuit, said of Oppewall, [...] "Jeannine doesn't suffer fools gladly, and she hasn't suffered me gladly when I've been a fool. She's fastidious, restrained and refined, and yet she has this impulsive side where she just takes off and chases butterflies." [...] Gary Hoblit, who directed the 1996 Oppewall-designed film Primal Fear, said he particularly appreciated her flexibility and versatility: [...] "While she may prefer a world in which less is more, she can still create an opulent and gooey world that is appropriate for someone unlike her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Giladi relates that {{he became}} politicized after an {{experience}} at the Socialist/Zionist party headquarters. He had received a letter asking for help with their Arabic newspaper, and {{when he showed up}} at the headquarters and tried to show them the letter, he was dismissively told to report to the [...] "Department for Jews from Islamic Countries" [...] by many people who had not even looked at his letter to see why he had been invited. He says that he [...] "was disgusted and angry. Either I am a member of the party or I'm not. Do <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> ideology or different politics because I am an Arab Jew? It's segregation, I thought, just like a Negroes' Department. I turned around and walked out. That was the start of my open protests. That same year I organized a demonstration in Ashkelon against Ben-Gurion's racist policies and 10,000 people turned out." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2007, a {{demo version}} of Montag's song [...] "Body Language" [...] was leaked on On Air with Ryan Seacrest, which {{featured}} an uncredited rapped verse by Montag's boyfriend Spencer Pratt. Montag has claimed she {{was unhappy with}} the leak, as the song was a [...] "joke" [...] {{and she did not}} want that to be the first thing people heard from her musically. Montag released the promo single, [...] "Higher" [...] along with an accompanying video shot by Pratt to iTunes on February 5, 2008. The song and the video immediately elicited a negative response from the online community. Two weeks later, a ballad titled [...] "No More" [...] was leaked online, and Montag later released it as a promotional single the following month. Two more songs, [...] "Fashion" [...] and [...] "One More Drink" [...] appeared on the internet in June 2008. Consequently, Montag released the extended plays Wherever I Am and Here She Is..., which were made up of previously leaked material. Following the album's release, Montag stated [...] "I've actually gone broke putting every dollar I've ever made and my heart and soul into this music. For me, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> appreciation, a different understanding, and a different love of my music and for my album than any other artist possibly could." [...] Montag later confirmed she spent nearly $2 million on the album. Initially, the album was to include Montag's debut single, [...] "Body Language", but the song was later removed from the final product. The album was eventually released on January 11, 2010 for digital download.|$|E
