5000|$|... 19 April 2010 - A Nepal Airlines De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 300 (9N-ABX) on {{a flight}} from Kathmandu (KTM) to Phaplu Airport (PPL) (with Kangel Danda as <b>designated</b> <b>alternate</b> <b>airport).</b> The {{aircraft}} was unable to land at Phaplu due to poor weather. The crew decided to divert to their alternate airport at Kangel Danda. The airplane touched down on its nose gear first and suffered some minor damage to the nose section.|$|E
25|$|Although a safe {{landing at}} Campbeltown was in doubt, {{the pilot was}} {{authorised}} to make an approach. Weather at his two <b>designated</b> <b>alternate</b> landing <b>airports</b> (Glasgow and Prestwick) was good in case the plane needed to divert.|$|R
50|$|At 23:04, {{air traffic}} {{controllers}} issued a weather advisory indicating severe thunderstorms {{in an area that}} included Little Rock airport. In the event that Flight 1420 was unable to land for any reason, Nashville International Airport was <b>designated</b> as an <b>alternate</b> <b>airport,</b> and the flight also had the option of turning back and landing at DFW. The flight crew witnessed lightning produced by the storm while on approach Little Rock. However, the flight crew discussed the weather reports and decided to expedite their approach.|$|R
2500|$|The flight {{engineer}} {{carried out a}} systems check, first from memory and then after consulting the flight manual. At this time, 19:20:42, the captain informed air-traffic control that he was experiencing nose-gear problems that, if not resolved {{by the time the}} aircraft reached minimum altitude, would force him to cancel the landing and divert to the <b>designated</b> <b>alternate</b> (McCarran International <b>Airport</b> in Las Vegas). This was the last transmission from Flight 933. The {{flight engineer}} conducted a manual check of the landing gear from the cockpit peephole, confirming it was down and locked. At this time, the aircraft had an elevation of 300 meters (1,000ft). The lowest speed that the pilots remembered was [...] with full flap extension.|$|R
50|$|Except {{for some}} US {{domestic}} flights, a flight plan normally has an <b>alternate</b> <b>airport</b> {{as well as}} a destination <b>airport.</b> The <b>alternate</b> <b>airport</b> is for use in case the destination airport becomes unusable while the flight is in progress (due to weather conditions, a strike, a crash, terrorist activity, etc.). This means that when the aircraft gets near the destination airport, it must still have enough alternate fuel and alternate reserve available to fly on to the <b>alternate</b> <b>airport.</b> Since the aircraft is not expected at the <b>alternate</b> <b>airport,</b> it must also have enough holding fuel to circle for a while (typically 30 minutes) near the <b>alternate</b> <b>airport</b> while a landing slot is found. United States domestic flights are not required to have sufficient fuel to proceed to an <b>alternate</b> <b>airport</b> when the weather at the destination is forecast to be better than 2000 ft ceilings and 3 statute miles of visibility; however, the 45-minute reserve at normal cruising speed still applies.|$|R
5000|$|US {{domestic}} operations conducted under Instrument Flight Rules: enough fuel {{to fly to}} the first point of intended landing, then fly to an <b>alternate</b> <b>airport</b> (if weather conditions require an <b>alternate</b> <b>airport),</b> then for 45 minutes thereafter at normal cruising speed ...|$|R
50|$|The {{other factor}} {{which is also}} helpful is the {{positioning}} of the initial <b>alternate</b> <b>airport.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Canada, {{unlike the}} United States, unless {{specifically}} exempted {{by a company}} Operating Certificate, IFR flight plans require an <b>alternate</b> <b>airport,</b> regardless of the forecast destination weather. In order to {{be considered as a}} legally valid <b>alternate,</b> the <b>airport</b> must be forecast to be at or above certain weather minima at the estimated time of arrival (at the alternate). The minimum weather conditions vary based on the type of approach(es) available at the <b>alternate</b> <b>airport,</b> and may be found in the General section of the Canada Air Pilot (CAP).|$|R

500|$|At that point, First Officer Klotz radioed the controller, saying, [...] "ah well I {{think we}} need {{priority}} we're passing [...]" [...] The controller inquired as to how long the flight could hold {{as well as what}} their <b>alternate</b> <b>airport</b> was. Klotz replied at 20:46:03 that they could hold for five more minutes. The controller once again inquired as to their <b>alternate</b> <b>airport</b> and Klotz replied at 20:46:24, [...] "It was Boston but we can't do it now we, we, don't, we run out of fuel now." [...] A handoff controller listening in on the conversation called the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (NY TRACON) at 20:46:24 and advised the TRACON controller that Avianca Flight 52 could only hold for five more minutes. The handoff controller asked whether NY TRACON could take the flight or whether to send Avianca to its <b>alternate</b> <b>airport.</b> The NY TRACON controller replied, [...] "Slow him to one eight zero knots and I'll take him." [...] The handoff controller later testified that he had not heard Flight 52 say that they could no longer reach their <b>alternate</b> <b>airport.</b> At 20:46:47, the NY ARTCC radar controller cleared the flight to proceed to JFK at [...] and to slow to [...] Flight 52 departed the CAMRN holding pattern at 20:47.|$|R
