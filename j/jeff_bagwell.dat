5|$|Prior to the 1991 season, Baseball America named Zosky the 22nd best {{prospect}} {{in professional}} baseball, ahead of <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell</b> (32nd), Chipper Jones (49th) and Jim Thome (93rd). That season, he attended his second Major League spring training, {{and was in}} competition with Manuel Lee and Rene Gonzales for the starting shortstop position. However, after making six errors during the spring, he was deemed unready for Major League action and sent to minor league camp on April 1.|$|E
5|$|Bobby Bonilla {{hit one of}} {{the only}} 13 home runs ever hit into the upper deck of Three Rivers Stadium, and one of the six to the right-field side. Willie Stargell is the all-time leader in upper deck shots at the stadium, hitting four of the {{remaining}} five right-field blasts; Mark Whiten hit the other. The left-field upper deck had been reached by <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell</b> twice, and Bob Robertson, Greg Luzinski, Howard Johnson, Glenallen Hill and Devon White (his home run struck the facade) once each.|$|E
5|$|Kinsler {{joined the}} 30–30 club, {{for the second}} time. He became the 12th player in major league history to have {{multiple}} 30–30 seasons. The only other infielders in major league history who had had multiple 30–30 seasons as of 2011 were Alfonso Soriano, Howard Johnson, and <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell.</b> He also joined the 20 (home runs)/20 (steals) club {{for the third time}} in his career. Joe Morgan, who did it four seasons, is the only second baseman to have joined the 20–20 club more times.|$|E

25|$|On August 26, {{former first}} baseman <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell's</b> number 5 was officially retired after a 15-year {{career with the}} Astros.|$|R
50|$|The 1,000 hit of <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell's</b> {{career was}} {{a home run}} on May 20 against Calvin Maduro, one of his two that game, in a 9-5 win over the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|R
5|$|The Cardinals {{faced the}} Los Angeles Dodgers in the divisional {{round of the}} playoffs. Five home runs in Game 1 and no runs allowed by the bullpen in Game 2 helped the Cardinals to win {{the first two games}}. A {{complete}} game by Dodgers pitcher José Lima enabled the Dodgers to force a Game 4, during which a home run by Pujols won the series for the Cardinals. In the National League Championship Series, the Cardinals faced the Astros and won the first two games in St. Louis. However, the Astros tied the series in the next two games in Houston, before a combined one-hitter by Astros pitchers Brandon Backe and Brad Lidge gave them the series lead. An RBI single by <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell</b> in the 9th inning of Game 6 tied the game and forced extra innings. In the 12th, Edmonds won the game for the Cardinals with a walk-off home run. Trailing in the sixth inning of Game 7, a game-tying RBI double by Albert Pujols followed by a Scott Rolen two-run home run and then an RBI single by Larry Walker in the 8th inning helped the Cardinals to a 5–2 win and their first World Series berth in 17 years.|$|E
25|$|In the 2006 offseason, {{the team}} signed Preston Wilson and moved Berkman to first base, ending the long tenure of <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell.</b> The Astros renewed the {{contract}} with Clemens and traded two minor league prospects to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for left-handed hitter Aubrey Huff. By August, Preston Wilson complained about his playing time after the return of Luke Scott from AAA Round Rock. The Astros released Wilson and he was signed by St. Louis. A dramatic season end included wins in 10 of their last 12 games, but the Astros missed a playoff appearance when they lost {{the final game of}} the season to the Atlanta Braves.|$|E
25|$|Martínez was {{selected}} as the starting pitcher for the American League All-Star team in 1999. The game, on July 13, 1999, was at Fenway Park, Martínez's home field. Martínez struck out Barry Larkin, Larry Walker, and Sammy Sosa consecutively in the first inning. He then struck out Mark McGwire leading off the 2nd, becoming the first pitcher to begin an All-Star game by striking out the first four batters. (The National League's Brad Penny matched the feat in 2006.) The next batter, Matt Williams, managed to reach first base from an error by Roberto Alomar. Martínez then proceeded to strike out <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell</b> while Williams was caught stealing.|$|E
5000|$|During a 3-2 {{loss to the}} Montreal Expos on April 26, {{first baseman}} <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell's</b> infield single gave him 2,000 hits for his career, joining Craig Biggio as the only Astros players to achieve this mark.|$|R
25|$|On October 31, the Astros {{declined}} {{option on}} <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell's</b> contract for 2007, subsequently ending his 15-year tenure as an Astro. Bagwell left his name {{well known in}} the Astros history books. On November 11, Bagwell files for free agency. Finally to end his amazing career, Bagwell announced his retirement on December 15.|$|R
50|$|The Houston Astros' 2005 {{season was}} {{a season in}} which the Houston Astros {{qualified}} for the postseason {{for the second consecutive}} season. The Astros overcame a sluggish 15-30 start to claim the wild card playoff spot, and would go on to win the National League pennant to advance to the World Series {{for the first time in}} franchise history. It was longtime Astros first baseman <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell's</b> final season and first World Series appearance.|$|R
25|$|Martínez {{was named}} the AL Pitcher of the Month in April, May, June and September 1999 – 4 times in a single season. Martínez punctuated his {{dominance}} in the 1999 All-Star Game start at Fenway Park, when he struck out Barry Larkin, Larry Walker, Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire and <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell</b> in two innings. It {{was the first time}} any pitcher struck out the side to start an All-Star Game, and the performance earned Martínez the All-Star Game MVP award. Martínez later said that the 1999 All-Star break was especially memorable for him because he was able to meet the members of the MLB All-Century Team and get an autograph from Ted Williams.|$|E
25|$|The newest inductees, {{enshrined}} on July 30, , are players <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell,</b> Tim Raines, and Iván Rodríguez, plus executives John Schuerholz and Bud Selig. In {{addition to}} honoring Hall of Fame inductees, the National Baseball Hall of Fame has presented 41 {{men with the}} Ford C. Frick Award for excellence in broadcasting, 67 men and one woman with the J. G. Taylor Spink Award for excellence in baseball writing, and three men and one woman with the Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award for contributions to baseball. While Frick and Spink Award honorees are not members of the Hall of Fame, they are recognized in an exhibit in the Hall of Fame's library. O'Neil Award honorees are also not Hall of Fame members, but are listed alongside a permanent statue of the award's namesake and first recipient, Buck O'Neil, that stands at the Hall.|$|E
25|$|On May 28, 1995, he {{beat the}} Astros, losing a no-hitter on an eighth-inning home run to <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell.</b> It {{was the only}} nine-inning one-hitter of his career. In June and July, Maddux threw 51 {{consecutive}} innings without issuing a walk. Maddux pitched effectively in {{all three of the}} Braves's postseason series, winning a game in each. His Game One victory in the 1995 World Series involved nine innings, two hits, no walks, and no earned runs with Orel Hershiser pitching for the opposite team. Maddux took the loss in Game Five, but the Atlanta Braves won their first World Series championship two days later. Following the 1995 season, Maddux won his fourth straight Cy Young Award, a major league record, and his second consecutive unanimous award. Maddux also finished third in that year's National League Most Valuable Player voting. The Atlanta Braves also made good on a pre-season promise to their pitching rotation, installing a putting green in the locker room at the newly built Turner Field following the World Series victory.|$|E
5000|$|In , he {{saw more}} playing time due to regular first baseman <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell's</b> injury. In 2005, he batted [...]233 with 10 {{home runs and}} 50 RBI, with 1 stolen base. He participated in the 2005 World Series where he hit the first World Series home run in Astros history, {{becoming}} only the second player whose last name {{is a type of}} animal to homer in the World Series (the first was Tim Salmon in 2002).|$|R
50|$|Returning to St. Louis, Matt Morris started Game 6 for the Cardinals, as did Pete Munro for the Astros. The scoring {{began with}} Carlos Beltrán walking with one out, {{stealing}} second, moving to third on a single, and scoring on Lance Berkman's sacrifice {{fly in the}} first. The Cardinals responded {{in the bottom of}} the inning with a two-run home run by Albert Pujols. In the third, Beltrán singled with two outs and scored on <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell's</b> double to tie the game. Again, the Cardinals responded when Édgar Rentería hit a two-run single scoring Albert Pujols and Scott Rolen {{in the bottom of the}} inning. Matt Lamb's home run in the fourth cut the Cardinals' lead to 4−3. In the top of the ninth inning Bagwell hit a two-out single off Jason Isringhausen, scoring Morgan Ensberg for the tying run. The game went into extra innings and ended when Jim Edmonds, who hit 42 home runs in the regular season, hit a walk-off two-run home run in the bottom of the twelfth off Dan Miceli, sending the series to a Game 7 showdown.|$|R
50|$|The final, {{deciding}} Game 7 {{started off}} with Astros' leadoff man Craig Biggio smacking a {{home run in the}} game's first at-bat off Cardinals' starter Jeff Suppan to make it 1-0. The Astros' threat continued in the second by putting two men on, but, thanks to a tremendous catch by center fielder Jim Edmonds, the Cardinals were {{able to get out of}} the inning unscathed. In the third, however, the Astros made it 2-0 with Carlos Beltrán, who walked and stole second, scoring on <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell's</b> sacrifice fly aided by Edmonds's error. The Cardinals cut it to 2−1 in the bottom of the inning when Tony Womack hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a groundout, and scored on Jeff Suppan's bunt groundout. Then in the sixth Albert Pujols doubled to score Ray Cedeno from third to tie the game and Scott Rolen put the Redbirds ahead with a two-run home run off Roger Clemens. St. Louis added another run in the eighth off Roy Oswalt when pinch hitter Marlon Anderson hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a sacrifice bunt, and scored on Larry Walker's single. Jason Isringhausen shut down Houston in the ninth to win the Cardinals their first National League pennant in seventeen years.|$|R
25|$|After {{losing the}} World Series the Astros {{prepared}} for the offseason by signing Preston Wilson and moving Lance Berkman to first base, ending the long tenure by <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell.</b> The Astros resigned pitcher Roger Clemens and traded two minor league prospects to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for left-handed hitter Aubrey Huff and cash. In August 2006, Preston Wilson said that he wasn't getting enough playing time since Luke Scott returned from AAA ball with the Round Rock Express. In response the Astros released Wilson and the division rival Cardinals signed him {{for the rest of}} the season. After a dramatic last two weeks of the season, including a four-game sweep of the Cardinals, the Astros did not get to the playoffs losing their last game to the Braves, 3–1. The Astros had managed to win 10 of their last 12 games of the season, and all but erased what had been an 8½ game lead by the front running St. Louis Cardinals. The Astros were within a ½ game of the Cardinals on Thursday September 28, but that is as close as the 2005 NL Champions would get.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{his last}} name, Bako gained {{temporary}} distinction {{as one of the}} Astros' [...] "Killer B's", which included first baseman <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell</b> and second baseman Craig Biggio, two formidable veteran players who helped established the Astros as perennial playoff contenders in the 1990s and 2000s. [...] In fact, journalist Dayn Perry jocosely noted the 1999 Astros, [...] "in pursuit of arcane history, used eight players whose last names began with 'B.'" [...] The eight included Bagwell, Bako, Glen Barker, Derek Bell, Sean Bergman, Lance Berkman, Biggio, and Tim Bogar.|$|E
500|$|Starting in 1948, he was {{the head}} {{baseball}} coach and assistant football coach for Greenfield High School in Greenfield, Massachusetts, and took over the head football coaching duties in 1958. [...] He held both positions, {{in addition to being}} a physical education teacher for a local middle school and part-time basketball referee until 1964. [...] In 1965, he was hired as a talent scout for the Houston Astros, a job he held for nearly 40years. [...] It was his evaluation of <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell</b> that led the Astros to acquire him from the Boston Red Sox for Larry Andersen.|$|E
50|$|With {{their backs}} to the wall in Game 4, the Braves sent Russ Ortiz to the mound to face Roger Clemens. Three {{consecutive}} leadoff singles in the second put the Braves up 1-0, then Adam LaRoche's double play with runners on second and third made it 2-0 Braves. In the bottom of the inning, the Astros loaded the bases on two singles and a walk before Clemens's sacrifice fly cut the Braves' lead to 2-1. Then Craig Biggio hit a three-run homer to give the Astros a 4-2 lead. Carlos Beltrán doubled and scored on <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell's</b> single to make it 5-2 Astros. Behind Clemens, the Astros were closing in on their first-ever postseason series win, but Clemens left the game in favor of Chad Qualls, who gave up a three-run homer to Adam LaRoche to tie the game in the sixth. The Braves took the lead in the ninth off of Russ Springer when Rafael Furcal was hit by a pitch with two outs, stole second and scored on J. D. Drew's single. The Astros got two one-out singles {{in the bottom of the}} inning off of John Smoltz, but Jeff Kent grounded into the game-ending double play to force a Game 5 in Atlanta.|$|R
50|$|The Cardinals struck {{first in}} Game 3 when Roy Oswalt walked Larry Walker {{with one out}} before Albert Pujols hit a two-run home run. Scott Rolen then doubled, moved to third on a groundout, and after a walk, scored on John Mabry's single to put the Cardinals up 3−0. The Astros cut it to 3−1 {{in the bottom of}} the inning when Carlos Beltran walked with one out off <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell's</b> double off Jason Marquis. In the top of the third, Pujols drew a leadoff walk, moved to third on Rolen's single and scored on Jim Edmonds' {{sacrifice}} fly, but the Astros cut the lead to 4−3 when Beltran and Bagwell singled with one out and scored on Lance Berkman's double. Pujols's single with two on in the fourth put the Cardinals up 5−3, but the Astros cut the lead back to one on Berkman's leadoff home run in the sixth off Kiko Calero. Jose Vizcaino doubled two outs later and scored on Raul Chavez's single to tie the game. Next inning, Beltran's home run off Julian Tavarez put the Astros up 6−5. Brad Lidge pitched two shutout innings for the save as the Astros evened the series with the Cardinals at two games apiece. Beltrán tied records for the most home runs in a single postseason (8) and most consecutive postseason games with a home run (5). The latter record would be broken by Daniel Murphy in Game Four of the 2015 NLCS.|$|R
50|$|Roy Oswalt took on Jaret Wright in the {{clinching}} Game 5. In {{the top of}} the second, a leadoff single {{was followed}} by a double before Morgan Ensberg's ground out and Jose Vizcaino's sacrifice fly scored a run each. Then Carlos Beltrán homered in the third to make it 3-0 Astros, but the Braves cut the lead to one on a pair of homers by Rafael Furcal and Johnny Estrada in the fifth. Beltrán's second homer in the sixth, however, made it 4-2 Astros. When Chris Reitsma took the mound in the seventh, the Astros were able to put the series away with a five-run explosion. Vizcaino hit a leadoff single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt and scored on Craig Biggio's two-out single. Biggio scored on Beltrán's single before <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell's</b> two-run homer's made it 8-2 Astros. Tom Martin relieved Reitsma and allowed a double to Lance Berkman, who scored on Jeff Kent's single. The Braves scored their last run of the series {{in the bottom of the}} inning on Johnny Estrada's RBI single off of Mike Gallo. The Astros added to their lead in the eighth off of Juan Cruz when Ensberg hit a leadoff double and scored on Jason Lane's two-out single. After Biggio doubled, Beltrán's two-run single made it 12-3 Astros. Dan Wheeler would come on to shut the door on the Braves in the ninth. Chipper Jones's flyout to left gave the Astros the win in Game 5 and gave them their first-ever postseason series win. After 43 years and multiple losses to the Braves in the playoffs, the Astros moved on to the NLCS.|$|R
500|$|In 1970, Mike Flanagan was {{suffering}} arm problems, and many scouts {{decided that he}} did not have a future baseball career, but he could hit well, so Benjamin suggested to the Astros that they could use him in that capacity and wait to see if his arm would recuperate. [...] The Astros drafted Flanagan, but he decided not to sign, and instead attended University of Massachusetts Amherst on a baseball scholarship. [...] During the 1990 season, the Astros were approached by the Boston Red Sox, who needed pitching and were interested in Larry Andersen. [...] Benjamin recommended that they ask for Red Sox minor leaguer <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell</b> in return. [...] The Astros were hesitant initially due to Bagwell's low home run totals, but Benjamin convinced them by explaining that his numbers were deceiving due to the large ballpark that he played in.|$|E
500|$|After {{his playing}} career, <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell</b> {{has spent much}} of his time with his family while {{sporadically}} taking coaching and special assignment positions for the Astros. [...] He is married to Rachel Bagwell, his third wife, with whom he has five children in a blended family. [...] Rachel had three children prior to meeting Jeff. [...] Before his marriage to Rachel, Jeff had two daughters, Blake and Bryce. [...] Jeff was formerly married first to model Shaune Bagwell (née Stauffer) in 1992, and then to Ericka Bagwell, with whom he had his two daughters. [...] Rachel is the widow of Greater Houston-area hand surgeon Dr. Michael Brown, the owner and founder of Brown Hand Center. [...] The Browns had two children from their marriage.

500|$|The Astros {{won their}} first World Series title in 2017 {{with three of}} their first-round picks on the World Series roster—Correa, series MVP George Springer (2011), and Alex Bregman (2015). One Astros first-round pick {{is a member of}} the Baseball Hall of Fame. Craig Biggio (1987), who played his entire 20-season MLB career (1988–2007) with the Astros and became a member of the 3,000 hit club, was elected to the Hall in [...] Carlos Correa is the only Astros first-round pick to have won a Rookie of the Year award, joining <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell</b> (1991, {{originally}} drafted by the Red Sox) as the two Astros to win ROY. No Astros first round pick has won a Most Valuable Player award or Cy Young Award with the team. Brad Lidge (1998) won the Comeback Player of the Year Award in 2008 with the Philadelphia Phillies, his first season after leaving the Astros.|$|E
500|$|Born in Boston, Massachusetts, as {{the only}} son of Janice (née Hare) and Robert Bagwell, <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell</b> and {{his family moved to}} Killingworth, Connecticut, when he was one year old. [...] Much of Bagwell's family is from the Greater Boston area, {{including}} both his parents, and are avid fans of the Boston Red Sox. [...] His favorite player, Carl Yastrzemski, was a longtime left fielder for the Red Sox. [...] Robert, from Watertown, pitched college baseball at Northwestern University and as a semi-professional.

500|$|The Houston Astros officially retired Bagwell's jersey number 5 on August 26, 2007, {{prior to}} the start of a game versus the Pittsburgh Pirates. [...] He was the eighth player in Astros history to have his number retired. [...] Two of Bagwell's closest friends and former teammates, Biggio and Brad Ausmus, spoke on his behalf. [...] Said Ausmus, [...] "He was the quintessential teammate. [...] He was a superstar who always put the team before himself. [...] And between he and Bidge (Biggio), they always {{shouldered}} the blame we struggled and tried to deflect the credit when we won." [...] Yastrzemski, Bagwell's childhood hero, delivered a special message: [...] "Congratulations, Jeff, on your number being retired. [...] I begged the Red Sox not to trade you when you were in the minors with us. [...] Boston's loss was Houston's gain. [...] See you in Cooperstown." [...] Three first bases were used in the game, each embossed with a commemorative insignia and inscription, [...] "No. 5, <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell</b> jersey retirement, Aug. 26, 2007." [...] One was given to Bagwell and the other two were auctioned to raise funds on behalf of the Astros in Action Foundation.|$|E
500|$|Among first basemen, Todd Helton of the Colorado Rockies and Albert Pujols of the St. Louis Cardinals {{have won}} the most Silver Sluggers, with four each. Helton won four {{consecutive}} awards from 2000 to 2003, while Pujols won the award in 2004 and three consecutive times from 2008 to 2010. Pujols has also won the award at third base and outfield before converting to first base. In the American League, four players {{have won the}} award three times: Cecil Cooper (Milwaukee Brewers; 1980–1982); Carlos Delgado (Toronto Blue Jays; 1999–2000, 2003), Don Mattingly (New York Yankees; 1985–1987); and Mark Teixeira (Texas Rangers, 20042005; New York Yankees, 2009). <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell,</b> formerly of the National League's Houston Astros, has also won the award three times (1994, 1997, 1999). One player has won the award while playing for two different teams during his winning season.

One father-son combination has won the award: Cecil Fielder won the American League Silver Slugger with the Detroit Tigers in 1990 and 1991, and his son Prince Fielder won the National League award with the Milwaukee Brewers in 2007. Pujols and Miguel Cabrera are the most recent winners.|$|E
500|$|The Astros invited Bagwell {{to major}} league camp in spring {{training}} of 1991. [...] Bagwell, expecting for the club to assign him to their AAA affiliate Tucson, enthused them with his play. [...] Because they, too, already had an established major leaguer at third base in Ken Caminiti, they approached Bagwell about shifting to first base, which he accepted. [...] Having not previously played the position as a regular, Bagwell received a crash course, playing minor league games {{in the morning and}} Astros games in the afternoon until Opening Day. [...] Observed The Sporting News: [...] "Rookie <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell</b> never played first base before this spring, but the position is his to lose. [...] It's up to his bat." [...] Thus, Bagwell made the major league club without an assignment to AAA, making the uncommon jump from AA to the major leagues, and made his major league debut on Opening Day. [...] On May 6, he hit the ninth-ever upper-deck home run at Three Rivers Stadium off Bob Kipper in a seventh-inning pinch hit appearance, estimated at [...] [...] Bagwell hit [...]350 in September. [...] He finished the year hitting [...]294 with 15 home runs and 82 RBI while leading the Astros in several offensive categories.

2500|$|On October 31, the Astros {{declined}} {{a contract}} option on <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell</b> for 2007, ending his 15-year Astros career and leading to his retirement. Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte filed for free agency. [...] On December 12, the Astros traded Willy Taveras, Taylor Buchholz, and Jason Hirsh to the Colorado Rockies for Rockies pitchers Jason Jennings and Miguel Asencio. A {{trade with the}} White Sox, involving the same three Astros in exchange for Jon Garland, had been nixed {{a few days earlier}} when Buchholz reportedly failed a physical. In the end, Taveras continued to develop and Hirsh had a strong 2007 rookie campaign, while Jennings was often injured and generally ineffective.|$|E
2500|$|After the 1986 season, {{the team}} had {{difficulty}} finding success again. Several changes occurred. The [...] "rainbow" [...] uniforms were phased out, the team electing to keep a five-stripe [...] "rainbow" [...] design on the sleeves. From 1987 to 1993, the Astros wore the same uniform for both home and away games; the only team in Major League Baseball to do so during that period. Its favorites Nolan Ryan and José Cruz [...] moved on and the team entered a rebuilding phase. [...] Craig Biggio debuted in June 1988, joining new prospects Ken Caminiti and Gerald Young.

2500|$|Maddux {{has been}} {{credited}} {{by many of}} his teammates with a superior ability to outthink his opponents and anticipate results. Braves catcher Eddie Pérez {{tells the story of}} Maddux intentionally allowing a home run to the Astros's <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell,</b> in anticipation of facing Bagwell in the playoffs months later. Maddux felt Bagwell would instinctively be looking for the same pitch again, which Maddux would then refuse to throw. On another occasion while sitting on the bench, Maddux once told his teammates, [...] "Watch this, we might need to call an ambulance for the first base coach." [...] The batter, Los Angeles' José Hernández, drove the next pitch into the chest of the Dodgers' first base coach. Maddux had noticed that Hernández, who'd been pitched inside by Braves pitching during the series, had shifted his batting stance slightly. On another occasion, a former teammate, outfielder Marquis Grissom, recalled a game in 1996 when Maddux was having trouble spotting his fastball. Between innings, he told Grissom, [...] "Gary Sheffield is coming up next inning. I am going to throw him a slider and make him just miss it so he hits it to the warning track." [...] The at-bat went as Maddux had predicted.|$|E
2500|$|While the Astros {{were dealing}} away their 1986 {{championship}} parts, they were grooming young {{players in the}} process, such as Ken Caminiti and Craig Biggio. Many people consider the best trade the Astros ever made to be their deal for <b>Jeff</b> <b>Bagwell</b> at the trading deadline in 1990. The Boston Red Sox, in a tight race for the American League East title, needed relief pitching help. The Astros gave the Red Sox journeyman Larry Andersen in exchange for minor-leaguer Bagwell, who would win the 1990 Eastern League MVP award for the AA New Britain Red Sox. With Mo Vaughn in their system, the Red Sox reasoned that Bagwell was expendable, and while Andersen did help the Red Sox to the divisional title, Bagwell {{went on to become}} the Astros' all-time home run leader and, in most people's minds, the second best overall player in Astros history, behind the great Craig Biggio. The trade was so lopsided that it appears on virtually any list of the best/worst trades in MLB history, and [...] "Larry Andersen" [...] became a popular phrase in Boston to describe the futility of the Red Sox front office during the 86-year [...] "Curse of the Bambino." [...] However, after the 1991 season, the Astros made one of the worst trades in franchise history, sending speedy outfielder Kenny Lofton to the Cleveland Indians for catcher Eddie Taubensee. Lofton would prove to be one of the best center fielders of the 1990s, earning five AL stolen base titles, six All-Star appearances, and four Gold Gloves.|$|E
