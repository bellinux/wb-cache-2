5|$|George held {{a number}} of titles {{throughout}} his life, as successively great-grandson, grandson and son of the monarch. As sovereign, he was referred to most often as simply The King or His Majesty. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> as sovereign, George automatically held the position of Commander-in-Chief.|$|E
5|$|Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest are {{considered}} both founders of Sheffield F.C. and {{creators of the}} code they adhered to. They continued {{to have a strong}} presence at the club, both being members of the committee. It was Creswick, however, who exerted more influence over the rules <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> of Honorary Secretary and Treasurer.|$|E
5|$|Newton {{was made}} President of the Royal Society in 1703 and an {{associate}} of the French Académie des Sciences. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> at the Royal Society, Newton made an enemy of John Flamsteed, the Astronomer Royal, by prematurely publishing Flamsteed's Historia Coelestis Britannica, which Newton had used in his studies.|$|E
50|$|Considered {{a liberal}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>positions,</b> Shehan {{supported}} Fr. Charles Curran and open housing, and condemned the Vietnam War.|$|R
50|$|In 1861, Duchesne was {{promoted}} {{to the position of}} ambassador. He was generally in agreement with Rutherford Alcock <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>positions</b> against the Bakufu.|$|R
50|$|Unusual for a European-trained rabbi of the period, he had {{a secular}} education, which aided him <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>positions</b> <b>in</b> North America, and allowed him to write books in English for an American public.|$|R
5|$|Tactically, Pirlo {{was capable}} of playing in several midfield positions, but was usually {{deployed}} by his club and national sides as a central midfielder, {{in the role of}} a deep-lying playmaker, due to his vision and passing accuracy. A highly technical and creative player, Pirlo is regarded by players, managers, and pundits {{as one of the greatest}} ever players <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>position,</b> as one of the best midfielders in the world and of his generation, and as one of the greatest Italian players of all time. He started his career in a more advanced role, as an offensive midfielder, and also played as a supporting striker on occasion. Although he was considered a talented young prospect, even drawing comparisons with former Italian footballer Gianni Rivera, Pirlo occasionally struggled in this role, due to his lack of pace, and competition from other talented and more dynamic players <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E
5|$|Carrick has {{represented}} England at under-18, under-21, B and senior levels. He made his England debut in 2001 {{and has since}} gained 34 caps but is yet to score an international goal. Carrick has often been overlooked during his England career, with Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Paul Scholes, Gareth Barry and (for a brief time) Scott Parker preferred <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>position.</b> This was the case until the 2012–13 season, when Carrick {{established himself as a}} regular. He {{has been a member of}} the England squads for two major tournaments, the 2006 and 2010 World Cups.|$|E
5|$|Creating the {{new design}} was the {{responsibility}} of Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock, who had been <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> since 1925. Much {{of the work in}} preparing the new coin was done by Sinnock's assistant, later chief engraver Gilroy Roberts. In early October 1945, Sinnock submitted models to Assistant Director of the Mint F. Leland Howard (then acting as director), who transmitted them to the Commission of Fine Arts. This commission reviews coin designs because it was tasked by a 1921 executive order by President Warren G. Harding with rendering advisory opinions on public artworks.|$|E
5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>positions</b> as clerk, Reily used {{high quality}} materials. The materials, {{combined}} with his [...] "bold" [...] character strokes meant that his hand-written {{records from the}} early 1800s were still clearly legible in the early 1900s.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> Birmingham <b>his</b> <b>position</b> {{was filled}} by Prof Charles Chesters.|$|R
50|$|After this incident, Prince Ōzato retired <b>in</b> 1861. <b>His</b> <b>position</b> {{turned to}} Yonagusuku Chōki.|$|R
5|$|Early in the 1934 season, Ruth openly campaigned {{to become}} the Yankees manager. However, the Yankee job was never a serious possibility. Ruppert always {{supported}} McCarthy, who would remain <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> for another 12 seasons. Ruth and McCarthy's relationship had been lukewarm at best, and Ruth's managerial ambitions further chilled their relations. By {{the end of the}} season, Ruth hinted that he would retire unless Ruppert named him manager of the Yankees. When the time came, Ruppert wanted his slugger to leave the team without drama or hard feelings.|$|E
5|$|Hancock {{was one of}} Boston's leaders {{during the}} crisis {{that led to the}} {{outbreak}} of the American Revolutionary War in 1775. He served more than two years in the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, and {{he was the first to}} sign the Declaration of Independence <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> as president of Congress. He returned to Massachusetts and was elected governor of the Commonwealth, serving in that role for most of his remaining years. He used his influence to ensure that Massachusetts ratified the United States Constitution in 1788.|$|E
5|$|He had a later {{career in}} law enforcement. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> as Tennessee's Commissioner of Public Safety and Patrol chief, Bomar {{supervised}} the ransacking of black households during the 1946 Columbia race riot. He was the warden of Tennessee State Prison from 1955 until his death, and oversaw several executions. In 1956, Bomar {{was the first}} Vanderbilt football player elected to the College Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
50|$|He {{currently}} {{plays for}} Mount Hagen Eagles <b>in</b> PNG. <b>His</b> <b>position</b> is at centre.|$|R
50|$|He became Master of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge in 1650, but was {{drifting}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{last years}} to the outer extremes <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>positions.</b> He was preoccupied by his concurrent post as rector in London, at St Mary Abchurch, and then from 1653 at St Bartholomew-by-the-Exchange. Oliver Cromwell had him imprisoned for aggressive preaching.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 Pandia {{played for}} the Port Moresby Vipers <b>in</b> PNG. <b>His</b> <b>position</b> is second row.|$|R
5|$|It was Johnson's {{practice}} to avoid interference with military decisions, however he supported Morgan's request for two light artillery pieces that became hallmarks of his command. By contrast, he consistently opposed {{the command of}} General Lloyd Tilghman, trying repeatedly but unsuccessfully to have him removed. It is unclear how much military influence Johnson wielded <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> as governor, though he enjoyed a cordial relationship {{with most of the}} Confederate generals.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April 1968, {{in another}} one of his {{frequent}} cabinet reshuffles, Bokassa demoted Banza to minister of health, but let him remain <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> as minister of state. Cognizant of the president's intentions, Banza increased his vocalization of dissenting political views. A year later, after Banza {{made a number of}} remarks highly critical of Bokassa and his management of the economy, the president, perceiving an immediate threat to his power, removed him as his minister of state.|$|E
5|$|On {{the advice}} of family friend and local Schutzstaffel (SS; {{protection}} squadron) leader Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Eichmann joined the Austrian branch of the NSDAP on 1 April 1932, member number 889,895. His membership in the SS was confirmed seven months later (SS member number 45,326). His regiment was SS-Standarte 37, responsible for guarding the party headquarters in Linz and protecting party speakers at rallies, which would often become violent. Eichmann pursued party activities in Linz on weekends while continuing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> at Vacuum Oil in Salzburg.|$|E
5000|$|The Cardinal, who was {{considered}} liberal <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>positions,</b> criticised the Church's [...] "antiquated forms" [...] and its [...] "resisting ideas, forms and possibilities to which perhaps the future belongs, and we often consider as impossible that which will finally manifest {{itself as a}} legitimate form of Christianity".|$|R
50|$|His son, Jean-Charles-Philibert Trudaine de Montigny, succeeded him <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{official}} <b>position.</b>|$|R
500|$|In later years, he used <b>his</b> experience: <b>in</b> 2012, the Birmingham Mail {{suggested}} that, {{in contrast}} to the [...] "more aggressive and animated" [...] Steven Caldwell, [...] "Pablo tends to be subtle <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>positioning</b> and tackling, he likes to read the game rather than go head-to-head in a gladiatorial battle".|$|R
5|$|Rudd {{initially}} {{said that}} he would challenge Gillard, but it soon became apparent {{that he did not have}} enough support within the party to survive <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>position.</b> Hours before the vote on 24 June, he resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the Labor Party, leaving Gillard to assume the leadership unopposed. Treasurer Wayne Swan was at the same time elected unopposed to succeed Gillard as Deputy Leader.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer {{was ordered}} to Carinhall, the {{residence}} of the Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, on 8 February 1945. Göring informed him about the intent to appoint him as Inspekteur der Nachtjäger (Inspector of the night fighter force), a role held by Oberst Werner Streib at the time. Schnaufer pushed back, not wanting to push out his friend and mentor from this position. He argued that he would better serve the German cause fighting the enemy. Göring was convinced and Schnaufer remained <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> as Geschwaderkommodore.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} in India continued to deteriorate {{throughout the summer}} and autumn of 1947. Nevertheless, Ismay and Mountbatten had agreed that Ismay would remain <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> for only {{three to four months}} after partition. In December 1947, he left India to return to England. Shortly after his return, Ismay served briefly on the British delegation to the United Nations to deal with the Kashmir issue. Ismay played only a limited role, as the Pakistanis suspected him of pro-Indian sympathies.|$|E
5000|$|In 1987 Bryan {{became an}} {{assistant}} attorney general <b>in</b> Alabama. <b>His</b> <b>position</b> was <b>in</b> the Alabama environmental department.|$|R
50|$|In the Summer Transfer Market of 2008, Trevor was {{the main}} target of several main clubs {{including}} Birkirkara {{and it was the}} 'Stripes' who won Trevor's signature for two years. The 2008-2009 season was not the best for Trevor, as due to <b>his</b> <b>position</b> of retire role of a right back, Trevor could not show off <b>his</b> skills <b>in</b> <b>his</b> favoured <b>position.</b> Although not playing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> favorite <b>position,</b> Trevor still managed to score two goals.|$|R
50|$|Sione Taufa is an American rugby league {{player for}} the Maui Rugby Club <b>in</b> Hawaii. <b>His</b> <b>position</b> is wing.|$|R
5|$|Though North Carolina {{head coach}} Carl Torbush was {{confirmed}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> {{prior to the}} Gator Bowl, several assistant coaching positions were not filled at the school until after the game. On January 11, Torbush hired then-Texas A running backs coach Ken Rucker to fill the new position of special-teams coach. To fill Torbush's former job as offensive coordinator, he hired Texas A offensive coordinator Steve Marshall, who filled the position until 1999.|$|E
5|$|White {{also played}} {{prominent}} role <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> {{as attorney general}} during the case of Elihu Gregg. Gregg had been convicted by the Preston County Circuit Court of burning the county courthouse and the public records therein, and causing {{the death of a}} janitress asleep in the courthouse {{at the time of the}} fire. Gregg was sentenced to death for these crimes, but following his sentence, he escaped to Greene County, Pennsylvania to the company of his friends and supporters, as the Gregg family was prominent in the region.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{proponent of}} the day fighter force and the defence of Germany, Galland used his {{position}} to improve {{the position of the}} Jagdwaffe. The need was now pressing, as Germany had declared war on the United States on 11 December 1941, and Galland was keen to build up a force that could withstand the resurgence of the Western Allied Air Forces in preparation for what would become known as the Defence of the Reich campaign. Galland was outspoken, something that was not often tolerated by Göring. Yet, by earning and cultivating the support of other powerful personalities in the Luftwaffe, like Erhard Milch and Günther Korten, and personalities in the industrial sector such as Albert Speer and even Adolf Hitler, Galland was able to survive <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>position</b> for three years.|$|E
5000|$|Reyes {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "intelligent <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>positioning,</b> comfortable <b>in</b> possession and strong in the air", as well as being praised for [...] "his ability to time challenges play crisp passes and keep possession when under pressure". Though mainly a defender, Reyes has also been deployed as a defensive midfielder throughout his career.|$|R
50|$|Hans Georg Bock {{rendered}} outstanding {{services to}} the development of structured, internationally linked, and interdisciplinary doctoral programs by several innovations like the mentoring system <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>positions</b> as speaker of diverse research training groups of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft since 1992 and as director of the Heidelberg Graduate School of mathematical and computational methods for the sciences since November 2007.|$|R
