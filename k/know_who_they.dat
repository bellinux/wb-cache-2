500|$|The rise of militancy became {{apparent}} to Frank Kameny and Barbara Gittings—who {{had worked in}} homophile organizations for years and were both very public about their roles—when they attended a GLF meeting {{to see the new}} group. A young GLF member demanded to <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> were and what their credentials were. Gittings, nonplussed, stammered, [...] "I'm gay. That's why I'm here." [...] The GLF borrowed tactics from and aligned themselves with black and antiwar demonstrators with the ideal that they [...] "could work to restructure American society". They took on causes of the Black Panthers, marching to the Women's House of Detention in support of Afeni Shakur, and other radical New Left causes. Four months after they formed, however, the group disbanded when members were unable to agree on operating procedure.|$|E

He also debunked the interview about him retiring from the music industry, saying that his words were taken out of context. The announcement was made via Frusciante's rarely updated website in an open letter titled [...] "Hello audience," [...] where Frusciante provides an in-depth response to the reporter who, according to him, misquoted him. He writes, [...] "I also must clear something up. I normally don’t read my press, but I heard about this quote, recently taken out of context by some lame website and made into a headline, in which I said 'I have no audience'. This has been misinterpreted, and by no fault of the excellent journalist who interviewed me for the fine publication Electronic Beats. [...] Obviously I have a public audience. I am aware of them, and they <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> are."

You know, more than 1,000 people will qualify from the private sector. Do you think we <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> are and we can make sure that they are all going to be OK? It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure I would not be eligible? It would be a sad day for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E

2500|$|The panellists play as {{individuals}} or as two teams. [...] "Celebrity What's My Line?" [...] completely destroyed {{the intent of}} the original— for players to guess the occupation of a third party by asking yes/no questions. The I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue version once employed the famous actress (and fan of the show) Dame Judi Dench in this role and the renowned television gardener Alan Titchmarsh. Each began by performing a mime illustrating their occupation, giving a cryptic clue to the panel (appearing to a radio listener as a short silence punctuated by exclamations from the panel and laughter from the studio audience), before fielding apparently serious questions from the teams (e.g. [...] "Is that your own hair?"

2500|$|Stipe {{wrote the}} lyrics of Monster in character. This, {{according}} to biographer Dan Buckley, [...] "set the real Stipe {{at a distance from}} the mask adopted for each song." [...] The album dealt with the nature of celebrity and [...] "the creepiness of fandom as pathology". Buck said the album was a reaction to the band's popularity. He added, [...] "When I read the lyrics I thought, all these guys are totally fucked up. I don't <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> are, because they're not Michael. I would say that this was the only time where he's done characters that are creepy, and I don't know if anyone got that. He was getting out his things by acting out these parts that are not him."

2500|$|Eventually, the NCAA {{investigation}} {{revealed that}} in 1985 and 1986, 13 players {{had been paid}} a total of $61,000 from a slush fund provided by a booster. Payments ranged from $50 to $725 per month and had started only a month after SMU had been handed its latest probation. The Times Herald later identified the booster as Dallas real-estate developer Sherwood Blount, Jr., who played for the Mustangs from 1969 to 1971 (though according to Parker, other boosters were almost certainly involved). The players had received a total of $47,000 during the 1985-86 school year. Eight of those players were paid an additional $14,000 from September to December 1986. The slush fund was due to be discontinued when the 13 players had all left the school. These payments were made with the full knowledge and approval of athletic department staff. [...] According to the Morning News, Hitch knew {{about the existence of}} a slush fund as early as 1981 and was involved in the decision to continue the payments even after SMU was placed on probation in 1985. The Morning News also said Collins knew certain players were being paid, but did not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> were.|$|E

2500|$|Das Racist's unique {{style has}} a strong {{polarizing}} tendency; their set at the 2009 Pop Montreal festival was described as [...] "the most divisive show seen at the festival". They describe their approach to music as [...] "'deconstructionalist': sawing the legs out from under hip-hop as they celebrate it". New York Times wrote [...] "Das Racist’s lack of piety has become an aesthetic of its own, with songs that are as much commentary on hip-hop as rigorous practice of it". The Root said DasRacist could speak for both [...] "the ‘hood or the nearest gated community". Playboy called the duo [...] "equal parts hip-hop and Cheech & Chong". In an interview with Sepia Mutiny, Suri described Das Racist's music:we’re not making music that’s instantly appealing. We dabble with non sequiturs, dadaism, repetition, repetition. We make dance music while talking about not-dancey things. We say things that on the surface can seem pretty dumb but it’s a mask on some Paul Laurence Dunbar shit for actual discontent {{with a lot of}} shit in the world. Further, {{not a lot of people}} want to hear rappers talk about Dinesh D'Souza being a punk, Eddie Said, Gayatri Spivak being dope or even <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> are.

2500|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{challenge to}} Jackson and Baird's theory, which more closely resembles actual legal policy, came initially from Elizabeth Warren. Warren argued that Jackson and Baird's model is dangerously oversimplified, {{and based on}} untested hypothetical assertions about behaviour. First, every system of insolvency law must necessarily make choices about how losses are distributed among creditors with multiple interest. Among these diverse interests include weaker creditors, particularly employees, who are less capable than others at diversifying the risks of insolvency. There is a distinct community interest in companies that survive, and no good reason why only creditors with provable proprietary interests in a company's winding up {{should be taken into}} account. This means it is reasonable to give preference to more vulnerable creditors, and to expect secured creditors take on some additional risk to ensure businesses survive for the greater good. The Baird and Jackson view essentially amounts to [...] "single-value economic rationality, an excuse to impose a distributional scheme without justifying it, and, incidentally, a way to work in a damn good deal for secured creditors." [...] Additionally, Lucian Bebchuk has argued that the institution of security interests operates as a partially unjustified negative externality against unsecured creditors. It is not clear, argues Bebchuk, that security interests are in fact efficient, and they are capable of subsidising their activities by diverting wealth from unsecured creditors to themselves without any agreement. In the UK, Roy Goode argues that banks usually take security interests, not because they would otherwise charge a higher interest rate (and so increasing credit to businesses for the benefit of all creditors) but because they calculate the market will bear it. The taking of security depends, not on efficiency, but on bargaining power. Riz Mokal, also deeply critical of the creditors' bargain model, suggests that if one were to follow Baird and Jackson's methodology but in a truly value neutral way, one would ask what creditors would hypothetically agree to if they did not <b>know</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> were at all (i.e. whether they were voluntary or involuntary creditors, secured or unsecured). This would likely lead to a result where secured credit was not inviolable, and insolvency law could take account of diverse interests, including corporate rescue.|$|E
