50|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>tappets</b> {{require more}} complex and more {{expensive}} cylinder head design. A number of subcompact car manufacturers prefer solid valve lifters due to lower design and production cost rather than <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets.</b>|$|R
50|$|They have a DOHC {{valvetrain}} configuration with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets,</b> driving four valves per cylinder. Exceptions are the 1.4 12V unit, {{also with}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets</b> but a SOHC valvetrain, driving three valves per cylinder, and the 1.9 8V and 2.4 10V turbodiesels, with a SOHC valvetrain with mechanical tappets, driving two valves per cylinder. Some versions have {{variable valve timing}} (VVT). The camshafts are toothed belt-driven. The 1750 TBi gasoline and 16V Multijet diesel engines feature <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets</b> with roller rocker arms.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>tappets</b> are tappets {{that contain}} a small {{hydraulic}} piston, pressurised by the engine's lubricating oil supply. Although the piston {{does not move}} appreciably or frequently, it acts as a hydraulic spring that automatically adjusts the tappet clearance according to the oil pressure. This makes the valve actuation self-adjusting {{and there is no}} need to adjust the rockers. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>tappets</b> depend on a supply of clean oil at the appropriate pressure. When starting a cold engine, with low oil pressure, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets</b> are often noisy for a few seconds, until they position themselves correctly.|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{improved}} {{performance of the}} new car was welcomed, commentators of the time noted that the V8-engined Silver Cloud II was neither as quiet nor as smooth as the straight-six-cylinder-engined Silver Cloud I, despite the new engine's <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappet</b> operation. [...] The new wet-linered V8 was also a little cramped in an engine bay intended originally for a narrower unit: in order to change the spark plugs {{it was necessary to}} remove the front wheel on the car's right side. [...] There {{seems to have been a}} problem with crankshaft breakages in the earlier V8s: this was blamed on lack of lubrication to the bearings.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} valve lifter, {{also known as}} a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappet</b> or a hydraulic lash adjuster, is a device for maintaining zero valve clearance in an internal combustion engine. Conventional solid valve lifters require regular adjusting to maintain a small clearance between the valve and its rocker or cam follower. This space prevents the parts from binding as they expand with the engine's heat, but can also lead to noisy operation and increased wear as the parts rattle against one another until they reach operating temperature. The hydraulic lifter was designed to compensate for this small tolerance, allowing the valve train to operate with zero clearance—leading to quieter operation, longer engine life, and eliminating the need for periodic adjustment of valve clearance.|$|E
50|$|The {{actuation}} mechanism {{is simply a}} piston and cylinder, similar to a small pneumatic ram. The tappet bore where a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappet</b> would normally reside, becomes the cylinder, and the retainer assembly becomes the piston. Pressurized air (nitrogen) is pumped into this cylinder which then causes the piston/retainer {{to rise to the}} top of cylinder, causing the valve to form an airtight seal with the seat. The compressed gas then becomes the spring, so to speak, but does not have the same traits as springs do at elevated rpm. A small light spring is sometimes fitted between the piston and retainer so that when the system is switched off the spring forces the piston down against the bottom of the bore, thus forcing the retainer upwards. This ensures that no crown-to-valve contact occurs when shut down.|$|E

5000|$|A further {{memorial}} service {{is held in}} the late afternoon and in the early evening the ceremonial and symbolic first lighting of the funeral pyre is held. As the Royal Family pay their last respects and place sandalwood flowers on the pyre, preceded by the buglers playing the Last Post, the 3rd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment [...] "Kings Own Bodyguards" [...] mount one last Royal Salute, followed by a three-volley rifle salute and the gun salute. Designated areas around Bangkok and nationwide offer the general public and tourists to place the traditional sandalwood flower wreaths as a sign of remembrance while the honor guards march off the crematorium area. At around 10pm the cremation proper starts as the urn or coffin of the deceased is transferred, since 2008, to the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappet</b> pyre east of the funeral pyre for cremation while the outer covering of the urn is removed beforehand. At this time, to mark the end of the mourning period traditional Thai dances and opera are performed (a tradition reinstated in 1995).|$|E

The journal's website is at: [URL] variation analysis (DVA) models have been used in the manufacturing industry for over 20 years to predict how minor variations in the size, shape and location of the components parts is likely to propagate throughout and affect the overall dimensions, operation and performance of a complete mechanical system. This paper is one of in series of four papers that describe how different techniques can be utilised to aid the creation and application of DVA models. This paper explains the development and use of a two stage DVA model to simulate the action of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappet</b> adjuster and dimensional interdependence that exists between the adjustment of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappet</b> and the actuation (opening & closing) of the cylinder valve. The three other papers cover the use of kinematic constraint maps to prepare the structure of a DVA model; the use of virtual fixtures, jigs and gauges to achieve the necessary component location and the required variation measurements, and the use of 3 D plots to display large numbers of DVA results as a single 3 D shape. A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappet</b> adjustor performs two functions; {{it is part of the}} valve train system that actuates (opens & closes) the cylinder valve and it also self adjusts to take up any free play in the valve train system. These two functions, tappet adjustment and valve actuation, are separate operations that occur at different times during the valve train operating cycle and so need to be modelled as different configurations in a DVA model. In a conventional multiple configuration DVA model, each configuration has to be fully constrained and mathematically closed independently of any other model configuration. This requirement makes it difficult to include the interdependence between tappet adjustment and valve actuation. The two stage approach overcomes this limitation by allowing the output variation from the tappet setting configuration to be carried over into the valve actuation configuration and can thereby fully account for the interdependence between the two operation...|$|E
50|$|The {{basic engine}} is a {{conventional}} 4-cylinder with 2 valves per cylinder {{operated by a}} single overhead camshaft and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets.</b>|$|R
50|$|While {{it still}} retains OHV chain drive pushrod layout {{it now has}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets.</b> Also now uses twin coil distributorless ignition.|$|R
50|$|Compared {{with its}} M10 predecessor, the M40 uses a {{belt-driven}} camshaft, and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets.</b> Like the M10, the M40 uses an iron block and an aluminium head.|$|R
50|$|The top end also {{featured}} adjustable tappets using the bucket and shim arrangement, and required checking every 25000 mi, although later (1990-) models had self-adjusting <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets.</b>|$|R
50|$|The C125 has {{the same}} {{crankcase}} as the Continental C145, although the engines differ in stoke, compression ratio and carburetor jetting. The C125 features a cast iron camshaft and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Toyota and Volkswagen Group also used a {{directly}} actuated, SOHC parallel valve configuration with two valves for each cylinder. The Toyota system used <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets.</b> The Volkswagen system used bucket tappets with shims for valve clearance adjustment.|$|R
5000|$|The 1964 Admiral was {{equipped}} with a 2,605cc straight-6 OHV of [...] providing {{a top speed of}} 158 km/h. An unusual feature of this engine was the incorporation of self-adjusting <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets.</b> This engine was offered on the Admiral only for its first year.|$|R
50|$|These engines {{feature a}} {{light-weight}} cast-iron semi-closed deck engine block with an aluminum cylinder head. The valvetrain consists of chain-driven hollowcast dual overhead camshafts (DOHC) that actuate 4-valves per cylinder via roller finger followers with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets.</b> These engines also feature a 78 mm bore spacing and fracture-split connecting rods.|$|R
50|$|As {{the whole}} process is {{actuated}} by hydraulic pressure at engine start, {{there is no need}} for service or adjustment. Another advantage is cheaper operation, as {{there is no need for}} service and charges associated with <b>tappet</b> maintenance. Usually <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets</b> survive through the whole of the engine life without any service requirements.|$|R
50|$|As well as {{its primary}} purpose for lubrication, {{pressurized}} oil is increasingly used as a hydraulic fluid to power small actuators. One of the first notable uses in this way was for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets</b> in camshaft and valve actuation. Increasingly common recent uses may include the tensioner for a timing belt or variators for variable valve timing systems.|$|R

50|$|A {{narrower}} {{range of}} engines was offered: the base power plant was the 225 cuin L slant-6, now with top-fed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets,</b> and the 318 cuin L and 360 cuin L LA-series V8s. The slant-6 was supplanted by the 237 cuin L V6 for 1988; in 1992 {{it and the}} V8s became Magnum engines. The 6BT 360 cuin L 12-Valve Cummins B Series diesel engine became an option in 1989.|$|R
50|$|The 326 was {{launched}} in 1959. Its actual piston displacement is 325.2 cuin L but it was marketed as a 326 to avoid confusion with the Dodge Red Ram 325. The 326 uses the same 3.31 in stroke as the 318, but with the largest bore of any A engine at 3.95 in. It uses <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets,</b> unlike the earlier A engines, and {{was used in the}} 1959 Dodge Coronet.|$|R
50|$|The O-320 {{family of}} engines {{externally}} resembles the Lycoming O-235 and O-290 family {{from which they}} were derived. The O-320 shares the same 3.875 in stroke as the smaller engines, but produces more power with the bore increased to 5.125 in. The design uses <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets</b> and incorporates the provisions for a hydraulically controlled propeller installation as well. The controllable-pitch propeller models use a different crankshaft from those intended for fixed-pitch propellers.|$|R
5000|$|As {{advertised in}} The Times, Friday, 2 October 1959: The {{cylinder}} block and heads are cast in aluminum alloy and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets</b> operate the overhead valves. The engine has a compression ratio of 8 to 1 and is fitted with twin carburetors with automatic choke.Other features available include fully automatic transmission, power-assisted steering, electrically operated ride control, redesigned and more flexible air conditioning, electric rear window demisters and press button window lifts.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the days}} when valve drive {{dynamics}} could be analyzed by computer, desmodromic drive seemed to offer solutions for problems that were worsening with increasing engine speed. Since those days, lift, velocity, acceleration, and jerk curves for cams have been modelled by computer to reveal that cam dynamics are not what they seemed. With proper analysis, problems relating to valve adjustment, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets,</b> push rods, rocker arms, and above all, valve float, became things of the past without desmodromic drive.|$|R
50|$|Beginning {{with all}} of the Saturn S-Series {{vehicles}} that were made in late 1999 (sometimes referred to as 1999.5 models) had received improvements to both the SOHC and the DOHC engines in the S-Series. These changes included revised pistons, new connecting rods, and new crankshaft counterweights in the engine as well. The Twin Cam cylinder head had now featured a new roller-rocker setup with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets</b> and roller cams replacing the conventional bucket lifter setup of the previous engine in the S-Series.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Cadillac V16 {{could be}} said to be two straight-8 engines on a common crankshaft and crankcase, because each bank operated entirely independently of the other with no other shared components. It sported a narrow 45° bank angle for use in the new Cadillac chassis (which became the Fleetwood). The engine was well engineered, with a counterweighted crankshaft (quite a mathematical challenge at the time), overhead valves, and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tappets.</b> It also had only two single barrel carburetors, one for each bank.|$|R
5000|$|At {{first the}} Typhoon were {{fitted with a}} 70 bhp 1991 cc, six-cylinder, overhead-valve engine, carried over from the pre-war 16 hp model, but from 1949 this changed to 2309 cc and 75 bhp by {{increasing}} the cylinder bore from 65 to 70 mm. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>tappets</b> were fitted to most engines, but {{towards the end of}} production there was a change to solid tappets. There was a choice of manual four-speed with synchromesh on the top three ratios or pre-selector gearbox.|$|R
