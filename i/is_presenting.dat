Jaime orders the High Sparrow to release Margaery and her brother Loras, threatening force against the Faith Militant. The High Sparrow declares that Margaery will not have to perform a walk of atonement, and instead presents King Tommen, who has agreed to unite the Faith and the Crown. When Mace Tyrell asks his mother, Lady Olenna what this means, she bitterly replies it means the High Sparrow has won.|$|E

25|$|Accordingly, Carr {{informs us}} that Mommsen's multivolume work Römische Geschichte (Leipzig 1854–1856) may tell the {{perceptive}} modern historian much about mid-19th-century Germany, while it <b>is</b> <b>presenting</b> {{an account of}} ancient Rome. A major recent event in Germany was {{the failure of the}} 1848–1849 Revolution, while in Mommsen's Roman History his narration of the Republic draws to a close with the revolutionary emergence of a strong state executive in the figure of Julius Caesar. Carr conjectures as follows.|$|E
25|$|Eva Funke {{analyses}} {{the description}} of the Inca state as a utopian bourgeois society in the third volume as a critique of Campe’s contemporary society. Thus {{the description of}} the ruling system, for instance, functions as a mirror to the current systems of the German states and shows a utopian ideal where the bourgeois characteristic of competence is more important than birth. In addition, Funke points to the recurring motif of revolution in Discovery. The trilogy <b>is</b> <b>presenting</b> revolutions as {{something that needs to be}} avoided because they can hinder achieving one’s goals and are responsible for the downfall of peoples.|$|E

Both teenagers long for escape ("No More").|$|E

25|$|As {{the larger}} temple {{dedicated}} to the king, the hypostyle hall or pronaos is supported by six pillars; in this case, however, they are not Osiris pillars depicting the king, but are decorated with scenes with the queen playing the sistrum (an instrument sacred to the goddess Hathor), together with the gods Horus, Khnum, Khonsu, and Thoth, and the goddesses Hathor, Isis, Maat, Mut of Asher, Satis and Taweret; in one scene Ramesses <b>is</b> <b>presenting</b> flowers or burning incense. The capitals of the pillars bear {{the face of the}} goddess Hathor; this type of column is known as Hathoric. The bas-reliefs in the pillared hall illustrate the deification of the king, the destruction of his enemies in the north and south (in this scenes the king is accompanied by his wife), and the queen making offerings to the goddess Hathor and Mut. The hypostyle hall is followed by a vestibule, access to which is given by three large doors. On the south and the north walls of this chamber there are two graceful and poetic bas-reliefs of the king and his consort presenting papyrus plants to Hathor, who is depicted as a cow on a boat sailing in a thicket of papyri. On the west wall, RamessesII and Nefertari are depicted making offerings to god Horus and the divinities of the Cataracts — Satis, Anubis and Khnum.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{consider}} García Márquez's book {{in terms}} of the historical novel, but differ over whether the label is appropriate. In his review of The General in his Labyrinth, Selden Rodman hesitated to call it a novel, since it was so heavily researched, giving Bolívar's views [...] "on everything from life and love to his chronic constipation and dislike of tobacco smoke". On the other hand, reviewer Robert Adams suggested that García Márquez had [...] "improved on history". According to critic Donald L. Shaw, The General in His Labyrinth is a [...] "New Historical Novel", a genre that he argues crosses between Boom, Post-Boom, and Postmodernist fiction in Latin American literature: [...] "New Historical Novels tend either to retell historical events from an unconventional perspective, but one which preserves their intelligibility, or to question the very possibility of making sense of the past at all." [...] Shaw believes that this novel belongs to the first category. García Márquez <b>is</b> <b>presenting</b> both a historical account and his own interpretation of events.|$|E
500|$|Goffman does {{break from}} his {{connection}} with George Herbert Mead and Herbert Blumer in {{that while he}} does not reject {{the way in which}} individuals perceive themselves, he was more interested in the actual physical proximity or the “interaction order” that molds the self (481). In other words, Goffman believed that impression management can only be achieved if the audience is in sync with the individual’s perception of self. If the audience is in disagreement with the image an individual <b>is</b> <b>presenting</b> then the individual’s presentation of self is interrupted. Individuals present images of themselves based on how society thinks they should act in a particular situation. This decision on how to act is decided based on the concept of definition of the situation. The definition are all predetermined and individuals choose how they will act by choosing the proper behavior for the social situation they are in. Goffman draws from William Thomas for this concept as well. Thomas believed that people are born into a particular social class and so the definitions of the situations that they [...] will encounter have been previously defined for them (480). For instance when an individual from a high class background goes to a black tie affair the predefined definition of situation would be that they must mind their manners and act according to their class.|$|E

500|$|Andy Kellman of AllMusic {{selected}} the song {{as one of}} the album's highlights, noting that it has [...] "a wide theatrical scope akin to that of The-Dream's own 'Nikki, Pt. 2/Abyss.'" [...] He further analysed: [...] "Over a swelling and receding production with echoes of Kim Carnes' 'Bette Davis Eyes,' Rihanna mourns ("Felt like love struck me in the night/I pray that love don't strike twice"), then confesses ("Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change"), then surrenders ("I'm prepared to die in the moment"). Perhaps no one should read anything into it." [...] Christina Lee of Idolator observed that the song [...] "casts out the album’s most heartbreaking line — 'I’m prepared to die at the moment' — but puts it in a context that doesn’t explain enough." [...] Esquires Miles Raymer thought that Police would have been a better band if they would have had Rihanna as their lead singer instead of Sting; however, he described [...] "Mother Mary" [...] as something to skip. Alike Raymer, Bernard Perusse for The Montreal Gazette felt that only [...] "Love Without Tragedy" [...] was worth listening to and described it as demonstrating [...] "a tiny bit of hope" [...] on the album. In a review of the album, Jessica Hopper of Pitchfork Media wrote that [...] "Rihanna sings a grim rhetorical: [...] "What's love without tragedy?" [...] However, according to her the real question that she and her songwriters <b>is</b> <b>presenting</b> on the record is [...] "Who is Rihanna without Chris Brown?" [...] "Nathan Slavick for DJ Booth was critical of the tracks theme, writing that [...] "Love Without Tragedy / Mother Mary", along with [...] "Stay" [...] and [...] "No Love Allowed", all discuss the topic of Rihanna being a non-controversial person who is struggling to find love in a [...] "mad world". He further wrote that none of them are impressive." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Social Security Act {{defines the}} rules for {{determining}} marital relationships for SSI recipients. The act requires that if {{a man and a}} woman are found to be [...] "holding out"—that <b>is,</b> <b>presenting</b> themselves to the community as husband and wife—they should be considered married for purposes of the SSI program. Consequently, if the claimant is found disabled and found to be [...] "holding out"; this claimant will be entitled of reduced or no SSI benefits. However, the Social Security Act does not accept that a claimant [...] "holding out as husband or wife" [...] should be entitled of Survivor, Retirement or Widows benefits, when the claimant's [...] "husband or wife" [...] dies. SSA rules and regulations about marital status either prohibit (SRDI program) or reduce (SSI program) benefits to indigent claimants.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Gutones" [...] is a {{simplification}} of two manuscript variants, Guttonibus and Guionibus, {{which would}} be in the nominative case Guttones or Guiones, the Goths in the mainstream view. The second major manuscript variant is either Mentonomon (nominative case) or Metuonidis (genitive case). A number of etymologies have been proposed but none very well accepted. Amber is not actually named. It is called the concreti maris purgamentum, [...] "the leavings of the frozen sea" [...] after the spring melt. Diodorus uses ēlektron, the Greek word for amber, the object that gave its name to electricity through its ability to acquire a charge. Pliny <b>is</b> <b>presenting</b> an archaic view, as in his time amber was a precious stone brought from the Baltic at great expense, but the Germans, he says, use it for firewood, according to Pytheas.|$|E
2500|$|As Virginia {{returns home}} she feels, as did Laura Brown in the {{previous}} chapter, {{as if she is}} impersonating herself, as if the person she <b>is</b> <b>presenting</b> herself to be requires artifice. She puts on this 'act' to convince herself and others that she is 'sane' and so Leonard will agree with the idea of moving back to London. Virginia understands that there is [...] "true art" [...] in the requirement for women such as herself to act as they do. Feeling in control of her 'act' she goes to speak to the cook, Nelly, about lunch. However, Nelly, with her petty grievances and implicit demands that the daily life of running the house which is Virginia's domain, be observed, overwhelms Virginia. Nelly appears to have a matronly competence whilst Virginia {{does not seem to have}} a house-wifey bone in her body.
