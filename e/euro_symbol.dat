40|$|This article {{describes}} the euro package 1, which converts arbitrary cur- 2 rency units into each other using the <b>Euro</b> (official <b>symbol)</b> as base unit, and formats monetary amounts in almost any desired way. The respective conversion rates are predefined for the national currency units of the Eurozone countries, every other currency unit can easily be added. The package allows to type e. g. 17. 6 to get something like 17, 60 öS (1, 28). All necessary calculations are with high precision done by the great fp package 3 by Michael Mehlich, which you have to install to get this package working.

As bomber planes fly {{in from the}} distance, they drop not bombs, but dollar signs, <b>euro</b> signs, {{religious}} <b>symbols,</b> and corporate logos. This imagery ended up attracting controversy due to the juxtaposition of dollar signs and the Star of David, which was deemed antisemetic by the Anti-Defamation League; Waters later removed the offending iconography and wrote {{an open letter to}} The Independent clarifying that the Star was meant to critique the Israeli government.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis aim {{to explore}} {{in what way}} the Euro crisis have affected the reciprocal relationship between European identity and the attitudes towards the euro, and how it differs between the members in the Eurozone and members {{that have not yet}} introduced the euro. This thesis is grounded in a theoretical view that the <b>euro</b> is a <b>symbol</b> through which European identity is created, but also that European identity is a factor for the attitudes towards the euro as a single currency. By statistical analysis of empirical data collected through the Eurobarometer, I discover that {{there is a difference between}} how the relationship between the European identity and the attitudes towards the euro changes during the Euro crisis. Members without the euro seems to be more affected than members with the euro, as the correlation between European identity and attitudes towards the euro weakens for members without the euro, which do not seem to be the case in member countries within the Eurozone...|$|R

50|$|There {{are also}} other considerations, {{such as the}} {{perception}} of the business community and how the symbol is rendered on computers. For a new symbol to be used, software to render it needs to be promulgated and keyboards need to be altered or shortcuts added to type the icon. The EU was criticized for not considering how the <b>euro</b> <b>symbol</b> would need to be customized to work in different fonts. The original design was also exceptionally wide. These two factors have led to most typefaces employing customized, font-specific versions, usually with reduced width.|$|E

Framework VIII (Framework 8) introduced the ability to display JPEG and [...]BMP files and to load such files into Framework databases. Of particular importance, all of the Selections and Functions' versions of Framework added the ability to share [...] "cut and paste" [...] (memory buffer data) between Windows and Framework.

40|$|Decimal {{fractions}} are the {{subset of}} rational numbers {{that can be}} written as common fraction with a power of ten as denominator (e. g., 2 / 10) or using the place-value system (e. g., 0. 2). Learning about decimal fractions is notoriously difficult for children. In a first study, we investigated the impact of prior knowledge and the developmental changes in the comparison of decimal fractions. We distinguished {{the impact of the}} value of the digits from the impact of the length of the fractional part on children's pattern of responses. Although both kinds of impact affected the success rate, the digit values had a stronger impact and were mastered later than the length. In a second study, we aim to investigate the age-related changes in rational numbers processing using three notation formats: decimal (e. g., 0. 5), decimal fraction (5 / 10) and fraction (1 / 2) notations. Results showed that fraction notation of rational numbers is mastered later than the decimal notation. A third study investigated the precursors of decimal fraction processing through a longitudinal study. Results show that the decimal system understanding was the stronger predictor of further performance on decimal fractions. In a fourth study, we investigated the impact of a problem-centered intervention based on the approximation of real numbers in the decimal system. Results indicated that the intervention led to improvement in both conceptual and procedural knowledge. Finally, we investigated the impact of the <b>euro</b> <b>symbol</b> on the processing of decimal fractions. The results showed that the <b>euro</b> <b>symbol</b> stressed the processing of the fractional part of the decimal part of the decimal as a natural number. (PSY 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|E
30|$|The Institute de Recherche et d’Enseignement Supérieur aux Techniques de l’Electronique, IRESTE, {{developed}} a dual on/off database [99], named IRONOFF. The database comprises handwritten samples of French writers including characters, digits and words. The contributors {{were required to}} fill forms having predefined boxes, and the ground truth information and the filled forms were later inspected by human operators. Each contributor filled three types of forms which have been named as B, C and D. The information on form B includes the lower- and uppercase letters of the alphabet, digits, the <b>Euro</b> <b>symbol</b> and the frequently occurring strings in French checks. Forms C and D comprise cursive words in French. The database contains a total of 1000 forms with 32, 000 isolated characters and 50, 000 cursive words. The online collection of these images is stored in UNIPEN format at a sampling rate of 100 points/second. The database has been employed {{in a variety of}} recognition tasks [100 – 103] as well as online writer identification [104].|$|E
40|$|Commissioned work, {{editorial}} {{piece for}} ‘Museums Journal’ March 2007 ISSN 0 - 027 - 416 -X Page 16. Diss was commissioned {{to produce a}} full colour illustration to appear alongside an article titled ‘Dutch Disposal’. This is the most recent {{of a series of}} work for this publication produced by the illustrator as a body of work utilising a methodological approach intended to appeal to potential clients. The target audience is visually literate and able to make associative links between image and text at a sophisticated level. In producing this piece of work Diss has built on his continued research for editorial outcomes. It was intended that the illustration produced should both visually complement the article and resonate with the content of the text while providing a more concise precis of the important nature of the issue, and thereby eliciting a more immediate audience response. The imagery chosen for this illustration was influenced directly by the article’s references to the financial implications of museums selling works that are not on public display and the wider impact this has on national holdings and public access [...] The visual elements of picture frame, the <b>Euro</b> <b>symbol,</b> curtains and hand, etc. were composed and rendered {{in such a way as}} to summarise and highlight the serious content of the article, while maintaining a ‘light touch’.

40|$|January 1 st {{came and}} went, and we survived the {{introduction}} of the Euro, the planet’s ugliest-named currency. I can now write cheques in �, do electronic transactions, and even lodge credits, should anyone be generous enough to send me money. As aLATEX user, I have discovered the € command in the textcomp package (which I should have mentioned last time, but mea culpa, I am a recent convert to LATEX and am still finding stuff squirrelled away that I didn’t know about). And, I’m pleased to say, LATEX’s is a much more suitable design to go with those serif fonts which have none of their own than the strange C-like designs put out by Microsoft in their TrueType replacement fonts (designed by and licensed from Monotype, of all people!). But € uses PostScript fonts (the T 1 encoding) and while that’s fine by me, it’s not for everyone. Full marks, therefore to Henrik Theiling for his eurosym package, which implements the original EU (sans-serif) design in roman, bold, italic, and outline using METAFONT, so it’s usable in TEX-based systems anywhere. No seriffed version yet, but the following table shows some of the glyphs available. n=sc sl=it ol m � � � bx � � � Adobe also has the Euro in PostScript fonts available for download, including sans and serif versions (with serifs top and bottom, too!), and there’s already a Euro in the china 2 e package (a METAFONT font). Bitstream sells a standalone pi font with the <b>Euro</b> <b>symbol,</b> and will customize your existing fonts for you (for a charge). Linotype sells nearly 200 Euro symbols for DM 100 but makes the same mistake as Monotype in pretending the E is a C in the serif versions.
