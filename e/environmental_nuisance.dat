50|$|In August and September 2007, {{despite the}} {{declarations}} to the Press of December 2007, Alicante Port Authority published five more large-scale industrial projects {{of the port}} extension zone - for the unloading of more than 100, 000 thousand tons of clinker cement dust a year, its storage in up to 21 “mega-silos” towers between 26 m and 55.2 m in height (plus unloading apparatus some 5 m high {{on the top of}} each mega-silo) with three cement plants (up to some 21-25 m high) for processing, bagging and distributing the cement. The proposed mega-silos 55 m high in the project of Sabanci Cements (reported to be equal to a 15-20-storey building in height), as well as all the other mega-silos are far taller than the three silos currently situated on Quay 14, which are only 8 m high (and thus within the Port Extension Zone general limit). Once again, the local residents and the opposition political parties voiced their strong opposition to the Port Authority's plans for the port's future.According to the opposition parties (the PSOE, the Izquierda Unida, the Bloc), residents’ associations from across Alicante and the residents’ Platform in Defence of the Port, the height of these planned mega-silos and factories, far in excess of the 12 m general limit, would serve to create a towering wall of massive industrial silos on the city’s Mediterranean shores, where no other building in the zone is more than 12 m high. Due to the proximity to the residential zones, the opposition has alleged (with EU presenting questions to the Spanish Congress in November 2007) that the barrier of concrete silos will serve as a sound board, which would reflect the current traffic noise plus (all the additional noise generated from the plants and associated heavy trucks) back into the residential zones of the city, causing an enormous <b>environmental</b> <b>nuisance.</b> Neither the Port Authority nor the projects have conducted any overall study of the associated environmental pollution (in particular the visual impact and the noise pollution) of all these proposed projects, and the only solutions they offer are to paint the mega-silos.

The META project has developed an easy-to-apply pricing methodology, based on a bottom-up approach. The main variable is the AADT -daily flow- applied to accurately estimate generalized road transport costs for each kind of vehicles and each type of road. Based on the current Spanish road network, the META model estimates all social costs: internal costs (fuel, vehicle maintenance, labor, insurance and tax) and external costs (infrastructure, congestion, accident and <b>environmental</b> <b>nuisances).</b> Computed for the 13, 156 Km of interurban highways network, the model calculates the costs for each vehicle type (Car, HGV, LGV and bus) and for each road network section following the interurban road characteristics (AADT, capacity and traffic composition for each section of highway network). The two main results of META model for costs in terms of policy implications suggest to moderate the construction of new interurban road infrastructures in Spain and to analyze congestion before to built new metropolitan roads. If we decide for a road pricing scheme based on the environmental, accident and infrastructure costs, because of the reduced number of the congestion situation, we can use the average external costs that are very similar to the marginal external costs...|$|R

The proposed method uses the flows of commodities and their geographic spreading as input to determine a set of good potential locations for transfer container terminals. This set can further be used as input for an iterative procedure based on both the p-HMP and the multi-modal assignment in order to identify the optimal locations for such terminals in Europe.

Data were collected from company documents, by means of a direct-question interview focusing on socio professional informations and through measurements. Descriptive analysis was used for sociodemographic and professional data and analytical approach was used for themeasurements. Results: In the company studied 88 % of employees were workers. Weaving department included almost 68 % of workers. The majority of employees worked as part of a three shift (85 %).

40|$|Background: Noise, one of {{the major}} <b>environmental</b> <b>nuisances,</b> affects the {{learning}} ability of children negatively. Objective: With the assumption that in the existing German 4 -type school system children are exposed to various noise levels in each type of school, we investigated the association between children's school type and environmental noise level. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we included 550 children—primary and secondary school students—aged 8 – 12 years, and who lived in 4 Bavarian cities. The environmental noise level was assessed by personal 24 -h dosimeter measurements. The associations of interest were assessed by linear regression. Results: The average day noise level of 80. 0 dB(A) was relatively high, exceeding the threshold level of 60 dB(A). In the model adjusted for sex, socioeconomic status (SES), and place of residence, noise level was significantly higher for primary schools by almost 2. 3 dB(A); however, after additional adjustments for age, this association was distorted. The mean night noise level of 43. 7 dB(A) was not associated with the school level. We could not find any significant differences in the noise level between different types of secondary schools. Conclusion: We found evidence that in Germany, children, especially of a younger age from primary school, are exposed to high noise levels during day in and outside the school environment. School administration and parents should work to make schools less noisy and more accomplished for learning to achieve a bright future for the children. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: <b>Environmental</b> <b>nuisances,</b> {{including}} {{ambient air}} pollution, {{are thought to}} contribute to social inequalities in health. There are two major mechanisms, which may act independently or synergistically, through which air pollution may play this role. Disadvantaged groups are recognized as being more often exposed to air pollution (differential exposure) and may also be more susceptible to the resultant health effects (differential susceptibility). METHOD: European research articles were obtained through a literature search in the Medline database using keywords 'Socioeconomic Factors, Air Pollution, Health' and synonymous expressions. RESULTS: Some studies found that poorer people were more exposed to air pollution whereas the reverse was observed in other papers. A general pattern, however, is that, irrespective of exposure, subjects of low socio-economic status experience greater health effects of air pollution. So far as we are aware, no European study has explored this relationship among children. Conclusion: The housing market biases land use decisions and may explain why some subgroups suffer from both a low socio-economic status and high exposure to air pollution. Some data may be based on inaccurate exposure assessment. Cumulative exposures {{should be taken into}} account to explore health problems more accurately. The issue of exposure and health inequalities in relation to ambient air quality is complex and calls for global appraisal. There is no single pattern. Policies aimed at reducing the root causes of these inequalities could be based on urban multipolarity and diversity, two attributes that require long-term urban planning...|$|R

But a recent study of transport pricing, the Spanish Road Pricing Model (META), had as one of its aims the capture of different degrees of acceptance of a generalized road pricing system, and demonstrated that these stakeholders are still not willing to fully pay for the external costs (environmental and road safety costs) of the road network.
