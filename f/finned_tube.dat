50|$|A typical {{run-around}} coil system comprises {{two or more}} multi-row <b>finned</b> <b>tube</b> coils {{connected to}} each other by a pumped pipework circuit. The pipework is charged with a heat exchange fluid, normally water, which picks up heat from the exhaust air coil and gives up heat to the supply air coil before returning again. Thus heat from the exhaust air stream is transferred through the pipework coil to the circulating fluid, and then from the fluid through the pipework coil to the supply air stream.|$|E

Data were taken by increasing the vapor velocity from 0. 4 to 1. 9 m/s for R- 113 and 4. 8 to 31. 3 m/s for steam. For both fluids, {{the improvement of the}} condensing heat-transfer coefficient with vapor velocity was smaller for the <b>finned</b> <b>tubes</b> than for the smooth tube. For R- 113, the smooth tube experienced a 32 percent improvement with vapor velocity, where the <b>finned</b> <b>tubes</b> (tubes A, B and C respectively) experienced improvements of only 0, 5 and 10 percent.

Three different heat management scenarios were examined at {{the degree to}} which they provide improved system performance. The three scenarios were: 1) plain embedded cooling/heating <b>tubes,</b> 2) transverse <b>finned</b> <b>tubes</b> and 3) longitudinal <b>finned</b> <b>tubes.</b> A detailed optimization study was presented leading to the selection of the optimized geometries. In addition, two different types of hydrides, LaNi 5 and an AB 2 -type intermetallic were studied as possible candidate materials for using as the first stage alloys in a two-stage metal hydride hydrogen compression system. As extracted from the above results, it is clear that the case of using a vessel equipped with 16 longitudinal <b>finned</b> <b>tubes</b> is the most efficient way to enhance the hydrogenation kinetics when using both LaNi 5 and the AB 2 -alloy as the hydride agents.

Convective heat transfer coefficient is proportional to fin pitch but inversely proportional to fin height and fin width. Pressure drop increases with the increase of fin height and fin width.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this master thesis {{is to increase the}} understanding of fluid flow and heat transfer development across a <b>finned</b> <b>tube</b> heat exchanger with help of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Three different geometries of <b>finned</b> <b>tube</b> bundles are considered. The <b>finned</b> <b>tube</b> bundles are made similar to existing experimental test rigs at NTNU. The purpose is to present a detailed comparison of the experimental data available and the result from a numerical model. Heat transfer and pressure drop performance is compared. The results are also compared with semi-empirical correlations from the published literature. This master thesis is a continuation of the project work. A main goal has been to expand the numerical model developed in the project work to include conjugate heat transfer. This has been successfully implemented by coupling the conduction and convection on the fins. Further a calculation method to predict the heat transfer on a row-to-row basis has been developed. The heat transfer coefficient and the fin efficiency are compared with the experimental data at each tube row for varying turbulent Reynolds numbers. The results shows that the heat transfer is predicted fairly good, but with some deviations. Generally the heat transfer is under-predicted for the two geometries having solid fins. The numerical model over-predicts the heat transfer for the geometry having serrated fins. The pressure drop performance is compared by looking at the pressure drop from the inlet to the outlet in the <b>finned</b> <b>tube</b> bundle. Larger deviations are seen between the numerical and experimental data for the pressure drop performance. Surprisingly, the pressure drop from the numerical model seems to be in better agreement with semi-empirical correlations from the published literature. The effects of uneven heat transfer distribution has been investigated. An uneven heat transfer distribution is first of all reflected in the fin efficiency. Fin efficiencies found from the experiments and fin efficiencies calculated from the numerical model are therefore compared to theoretical fin efficiencies and reputable corrected fin efficiencies from the literature. A qualitative analysis is performed by investigating relevant visualizations of the flow through the <b>finned</b> <b>tube</b> bundle. This analysis revealed several important effects happening in the <b>finned</b> <b>tube</b> bundles, affecting the heat transfer. This include boundary-layer development across the fins, horseshoe vortexes at the junction of the fin and tube and flow separation downstream of the <b>finned</b> <b>tube</b> rows.

This investigation {{was carried out in}} order to determine whether roped (or spirally indented) tubes could be used to improve the amount of heat transferred by the secondary heat exchanger in a domestic natural gas fired condensing boiler. Experiments were carried out using purpose built test apparatus and three types of heat exchanger tubes (plain, roped and <b>finned</b> <b>tubes</b> respectively) that were used to make up four distinct heat exchangers. Two of the experimental heat exchangers were comprised solely of plain and roped tubes while two of the heat exchangers were hybrids, made up of a combination of <b>finned</b> and plain <b>tubes</b> and <b>finned</b> and roped <b>tubes</b> respectively. The results of these experiments showed that the heat exchanger made up solely of roped or spirally indented tubes transferred less heat than an equivalent plain tube heat exchanger. When the roped (or spirally indented) tubes were combined with <b>finned</b> <b>tubes</b> to form a hybrid heat exchanger, it was determined that more heat was transferred than by a similar hybrid heat exchanger that consisted of plain and <b>finned</b> <b>tubes.</b> The experiments also showed that increasing the velocity of the natural gas combustion products as they flowed through the secondary heat exchanger resulted in an increase in the amount of heat transferred by the four heat exchangers. Additionally, information is presented about the effect that air, excess to that required for stoichiometric combustion, had on heat transfer and the condensing regime present on the plain, roped and <b>finned</b> <b>tubes</b> in a secondary heat exchanger in a condensing boiler. In addition to the experimental work, theoretical modelling was also performed using a modified CFD model to calculate the performance of the four heat exchangers. At high fuel gas velocity the theoretical results produced by the modified CFD model for both the plain and roped tube heat exchangers were found to be good, while the low flue gas velocity results were found to be less accurate.
