5|$|As a major <b>industrial</b> <b>city</b> {{into the}} mid-20th century, Omaha shared in social {{tensions}} of larger cities that accompanied rapid growth and many new immigrants and migrants. By the 1950s, Omaha was {{a center for}} illegal gambling, while experiencing dramatic job losses and unemployment because of dramatic restructuring of the railroads and the meatpacking industry, {{as well as other}} sectors. Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination and job losses generated different crimes in the late 20th century, with drug trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent crime rates, which climbed after 1986 as Los Angeles gangs made affiliates in the city.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its image}} as a port and <b>industrial</b> <b>city,</b> Haifa is the {{cultural}} hub of northern Israel.

The principal Arabic theater servicing the northern Arab population is the al-Midan Theater. Other theaters in the city include the Krieger Centre for the Performing Arts and the Rappaport Art and Culture Center. The Congress Center hosts exhibitions, concerts and special events.|$|E

5|$|Gil {{was born}} in Salvador, an <b>industrial</b> <b>city</b> in the {{northeast}} of Brazil, though {{he spent much of}} his childhood in nearby Ituaçu. Ituaçu was a small town of fewer than a thousand, located in the sertão, or countryside, of Bahia. His father, José Gil Moreira, was a doctor; his mother, Claudina Passos Gil Moreira, an elementary school teacher. As a young boy, he attended a Marist Brothers school. Gil remained in Ituaçu until he was nine years old, returning to Salvador for secondary school.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield {{remained}} a major <b>industrial</b> <b>city</b> throughout {{the first half}} of the 20th century, but the downturn in world trade following the 1973 oil crisis, technological improvements and economies of scale, and a wide-reaching restructuring of steel production throughout the European Economic Community led to the closure of many of the steelworks from the early 1970s onward. Urban and economic regeneration schemes were initiated in the late 1980s. The city centre was blighted by empty shops and improvements were halted by the Great Recession.|$|E
5|$|The city of Nagasaki {{had been}} one of the largest {{seaports}} in southern Japan, and was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging industrial activity, including the production of , ships, military equipment, and other war materials. The four largest companies in the city were Mitsubishi Shipyards, Electrical Shipyards, Arms Plant, and Steel and Arms Works, which employed about 90% of the city's labor force, and accounted for 90% of the city's industry. Although an important <b>industrial</b> <b>city,</b> Nagasaki had been spared from firebombing because its geography made it difficult to locate at night with AN/APQ-13 radar.|$|E

50|$|By the 1840s, the Industrial Revolution was {{transforming}} the Northeast, with a dense network of railroads, canals, textile mills, small <b>industrial</b> <b>cities,</b> and growing commercial centers, with hubs in Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia. Although manufacturing interests, especially in Pennsylvania, sought a high tariff, the actual tariff in effect was low, and was reduced several times, with the 1857 tariff {{the lowest in}} decades. The Midwest region, based on farming and increasingly on animal production, was growing rapidly, using the railroads and river systems to ship food to slave plantations in the south, <b>industrial</b> <b>cities</b> in the East, and <b>industrial</b> <b>cities</b> in Britain and Europe.|$|R

5|$|In the 19th century, private turnpike {{companies}} {{constructed and}} improved {{a few of}} the more important roadways in the state. Turnpikes were chartered by the state and privately financed, with tolls collected at toll houses every few miles along the road. The first turnpike in Delaware was the Newport Gap Pike, which was built in 1808 and completed to Wilmington in 1811. Many other turnpikes were constructed in northern New Castle County radiating from Wilmington and connected the <b>industrial</b> <b>city</b> to agricultural areas. The turnpikes were built as straight roads in order to reduce costs. Many of these roads were constructed with a macadam surface. During the course of the 19th century, new methods of transportation such as canals and railroads came about and there was less investment on roads. The revenues of the turnpike companies fell and roads became more of a local concern.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, the Belgian team {{directly}} supported charity. Between 1914 and 1941 {{they played}} at minimum five unofficial games {{of which the}} returns were for charitable purposes: two against France, and three against the Netherlands. In mid-1986, when the Belgian delegation reached the Mexico World Cup semi-finals, the squad started a project titled Casa Hogar, an idea of delegation leader Michel D'Hooghe. Casa Hogar is a home for street children in the Mexican <b>industrial</b> <b>city</b> of Toluca, to which the footballers donated part of their tournament bonuses. In August 2013, the national team supported four social projects through the charity fund Football+ Foundation, by playing an A-match with a plus sign {{on the shoulders of}} their jerseys and auctioning the shirts.|$|E
5|$|Since the House of Commons {{regularly}} rejected direct {{challenges to}} the system of representation by large majorities, supporters of reform had to content themselves with more modest measures. The Whig Lord John Russell brought forward one such measure in 1820, proposing the disfranchisement of the notoriously corrupt borough of Grampound in Cornwall. He suggested that the borough's two seats {{be transferred to the}} city of Leeds. Tories in the House of Lords agreed to the disfranchisement of the borough, but refused to accept the precedent of directly transferring its seats to an <b>industrial</b> <b>city.</b> Instead, they modified the proposal so that two further seats were given to Yorkshire, the county in which Leeds is situated. In this form, the bill passed both houses and became law. In 1828, Lord John Russell suggested that Parliament repeat the idea by abolishing the corrupt boroughs of Penryn and East Retford, and by transferring their seats to Manchester and Birmingham. This time, however, the House of Lords rejected his proposals. In 1830, Russell proposed another, similar scheme: the enfranchisement of Leeds, Manchester, and Birmingham, and the disfranchisement of the next three boroughs found guilty of corruption; again, the proposal was rejected.|$|E

30|$|The stereotyped <b>industrial</b> new <b>city</b> {{construction}} {{conducted by}} the local government has led to blind expansion of <b>cities</b> and imbalanced <b>industrial</b> development, which is mainly expressed as the following three aspects: first, industrial park clusters and local government depend on preferential policies to undertake industrial transfer, which is easy to repeat the low level industrial development and assimilate local industry structure. Second, <b>industrial</b> new <b>cities</b> have been expanded too rapidly, and the competition of local government undertaking industrial transfer is increasingly fierce. Especially, in post financial crisis era, the re-industrialization strategy of developed countries updated the scale {{and structure of the}} world’s industrial transfer, and many newly built <b>industrial</b> <b>cities</b> have stayed as empty with little business activities. Third, <b>industrial</b> new <b>cities</b> have been expanded too rapidly, while it is very difficult, in short time, to eliminate various institutional barriers of restricting rural surplus labor’s migration into cities for settlements, and also, many newly built <b>industrial</b> <b>cities</b> are in such situation with no supporting industry.|$|R
