40|$|Three {{cases of}} air staging were {{examined}} in a 12 MW circulating fluidised bed boiler: i) no staging, ii} normal staging and iii) intensified staging. The conditions inside the combustion chamber were investigated by zirconia cell measurements of the oxygen partial pressure, 0. 35, 0. 65 and 8 m above the bottom air distributor plate. A significant effect of the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>staging</b> {{was seen in the}} two lower locations: At 0. 65 m height the fraction of time under substoichiometric conditions was low in the no-staging case (2 - 35 %), at normal staging it was 70 - 90 %, whereas at intensified staging it was 100 Y [...] At 0. 35 m height, i. e. in the dense bed, a similar effect was seen, although the fraction of time under reducing conditions was lower. The fraction of time under reducing conditions was low {{in the top of the}} combustion chamber in all three cases. The increase in the fraction of time under reducing conditions with a higher <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>staging</b> is associated with a decrease in sulphur capture. It is assumed that a release of SO 2 from CaSO 4 takes place during the transitions between oxidising and reducing conditions. Thus, the rapid alternations between oxidising and reducing conditions, as seen with the zirconia cell, offer an explanation of the reductive decomposition and, accordingly, of the dependence of sulphur capture on temperature and on the extent of staging...|$|E

This study was carried out to identify the clinical characteristics of obese adolescents with a higher probability of ADHD and advance {{the understanding of the}} potential factors underlying the comorbidity between obesity and ADHD. We evaluated the association between ADHD symptoms and bulimic behaviors, depressive and anxiety symptoms, <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> obesity, pubertal <b>stage,</b> age and gender in a clinical sample of obese adolescents. Design: cross-sectional study. Subjects: ninety-nine severely obese adolescents aged 12 – 17 years. Measurements: subjects filled out the Bulimic Investigatory Test, Edinburgh, the Beck Depression Inventory and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children. Their parents completed the Conners Parent Rating Scale, which assesses ADHD symptoms. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> overweight was expressed as body mass index-z score. Puberty development was clinically assessed on the basis <b>of</b> Tanner <b>stages.</b> Results: bulimic behaviors were significantly associated with ADHD symptoms after controlling for depressive and anxiety symptoms. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> overweight, pubertal <b>stage,</b> age and gender were not significantly associated with ADHD symptoms. Conclusion: obese adolescents with bulimic behaviors may have a higher probability to present with ADHD symptoms independently from associated depressive or anxiety symptoms. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> overweight, pubertal <b>stage,</b> age and gender might not be useful for detecting obese adolescents with ADHD symptoms. Therefore, we suggest systematic screening for ADHD in obese adolescents with bulimic behaviors. Further studies are needed to understand which specific dimension of ADHD primarily accounts for the association with bulimic behaviors. Future research should also investigate the causal link between bulimic behaviors and ADHD and explore potential common neurobiological alterations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} an analytical framework for predicting competitive performance in accordance with the competitive anxiety model developed by the authors (1988). Questionnaires were sent to 98 high school boys baseball teams participating in the final game of the pre-match for a National High School Baseball Tournament. The questionnaires were administered within one week after the competition in the tournament. The questionnaire consisted of Trait-State Anxiety Inventory for Sport (TAIS and SAIS), Diagnostic Inventory for Psychological-Competitive Ability (DIPCA), Diagnostic Inventory for Psychological Performance for Sport (DIPPS) developed by the authors (1988), as well as items tapping batting average, cognitive appraisal <b>of</b> the event, <b>stage</b> fright and coping with competitive anxiety. Out of a total of 463 athletes, 284 athletes filled out the questionnaires completely and were included in subsequent analyses. The results of Chi-square analysis revealed that there was a significant relationship between competitive state anxiety (SAIS) and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>stage</b> fright. There was also a significant relationship between psychological performance scores (DIPPS) and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> making full use of one 2 ̆ 7 s ability. The results of multiple regression analysis also indicated that competitive psychological-competitive ability (DIPCA) was a significant predictor of psychological performance (DIPPS), and competitive trait anxiety (TAIS) was a significant predictor of state anxiety (SAIS). In addition, coping with competitive anxiety was a significant predictor for enhancing psychological performance and reducing anxiety. Unfortunately, no significant predictors of cognitive appraisal of the sporting event were found in this study.

40|$|This thesis work {{examines}} the scalability <b>of</b> an imprinting <b>stage</b> utilizing parallel self-aligning mechanisms in a DNA combing and imprinting (DCl) process. Scalability is vital in developing efficient, low-cost and high-yield manufacturing processes, {{and improving the}} scalability of the DCI imprinting process will benefit biomedical research by enabling the affordable and scalable production of micro/nanoarrays for drug discovery, protein isolation, nanofluidics, and other applications. Previous work on the DCI process has primarily focused on {{the mechanics of the}} imprinting process rather than scale, and misalignments between the stamp and slide surfaces make it difficult to increase the scale without drastically increasing the complexity of the system, particularly when a 3 <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> freedom positioning device is used. Herein, a 1 <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> motion <b>stage</b> with 3 independent, passive self-aligning mechanisms is demonstrated to achieve high performance at 3 times the scale of previous devices. The influence of kinematic coupling repeatability, parallelism, and linear motion parasitics on the performance of the imprinting device was identified, and the device's performance was measured. The repeatability of the kinematic couplings and the magnitude of the parasitic motions were found to exceed the gage resolution of 12. 7 [mu]m, and the initial parallelism variation <b>of</b> the <b>stage</b> is less than 140 [mu]m. A mathematical model to quantify the scalability of the device was also developed by examining its ability to handle misalignments in the stage, stamp, and slide alignment. Analysis with the model demonstrated the ability of the device to accommodate maximum misalignments ranging from 3. 9 ° to 9. 3 °, confirming the minimal performance-scale tradeoff <b>of</b> a 1 <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> freedom motion <b>stage.</b> Through this analysis, this thesis demonstrates the effectiveness of parallel, self-aligning stamp mechanisms in a scalable DCI process, and provides a framework for future development <b>of</b> scalable imprinting <b>stages.</b> by John J.

This gave the author the opportunity to study winter-hardiness. It was possible to develop winter wheat varieties with sufficient winter- hardiness, slight need of vernalization and rapid spring development. Varieties of winter barley could be developed with a better winter-hardiness. The method recommended by Hoffmann of vernalizing the seed before sowing in autumn to test and select for winter-hardiness was highly practicable.

40|$|Synopsis Complex {{life cycles}} involve a set <b>of</b> {{discrete}} <b>stages</b> that can differ dramatically {{in form and}} function. Transitions between different stages vary in nature and magnitude; likewise, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> autonomy among <b>stages</b> enabled by these transitions can vary as well. Because the selective value of traits is likely to shift over ontogeny, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> autonomy among <b>stages</b> is important for understanding how processes at one life-history stage alter the conditions for performance and selection at others. We pose 3 questions that help to define a research focus on processes that integrate function across life cycles. First, {{to what extent do}} particular transitions between life-history stages allow those stages to function as autonomous units? We identify the roles that stages play in the life history, types <b>of</b> transitions between <b>stages,</b> and 3 forces (structural, genetic/ epigenetic, and experiential) that can contribute to integration among stages. Second, what are the potential implications of integration across life cycles for assumptions and predictions of life-history theory? We provide 3 examples where theory has traditionally focused on processes acting within stages in isolation from others. Third, what are the long-term consequences of carryover of experience from one life cycle stage to the next? We distinguish 3 scenarios: persistence (effects of prior experience persist through subsequent stages), amplification (effects persist and are magnified at subsequent stages), and compensation (effects are compensated for and diminish at subsequent stages). We use these scenarios to differentiate between effects of a carryover of state and carryover into subsequent processes. The symposium introduced by our discussion is meant to highlight how discrete stages can be functionally coupled, such that life cycle evolution becomes a more highly integrated response t...|$|R

The physics and chemistry controlling corrosion processes can be highly non-linear and are challenging to describe in terms of their likely impact. Therefore, decisions involving operating conditions and the selection of coal, combustion equipment and waterwall protection often have been made in a conservative and less than optimal manner. This paper describes the application of a multi-point, real-time corrosion surveillance system to a large boiler firing high sulfur coal. This technology, incorporating electrochemical sensing and wireless signal transmission, enables combustion engineers and plant operating personnel to make informed decisions regarding the quantitative relationships between operating conditions, NOx emissions, and the resultant extent/magnitude of waterwall corrosion...|$|R
