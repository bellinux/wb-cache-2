60|$|Fifthly. This is thy day {{to prevent}} {{the loss of the}} one, and to get an {{interest}} in the other; this is the day of salvation, the accepted day of the Lord (2 Cor 6:2). Let the sun of this day be set before this work be done, and an everlasting night of darkness will close thee in, wherein thou, thou shalt have time enough indeed to bemoan thy folly, but none to learn to grow wiser. It is a sad thing, especially in soul concernments, to be wise too late, and to cry out when time is past, O that I had improved it when it was present. Then will the remembrance of thy former misspent time, and thy despair of ever gaining more, be like poisoned arrows drinking up they spirit. Amongst all the talents God hath entrusted man withal, this is not the least, because on it depends eternity; and according to the use we make of this, will our eternal condition be, though the most of men live at such a rate as if it was given them to no other end than to waste in wickedness, and consume in pleasures. What means else their spending days, weeks, months, years, yea, their whole life, in whoring, swearing, playing, coveting, and fulfilling the lusts of the flesh, so that when they come to die, the great work that they were sent to do is then to be done; their souls, Christ, eternity, was scarce thought on before; but now, when merciless death begins to gripe them, then do they begin to bethink themselves of those things which they should have got in readiness before, and that is the reason why we so often hear many that lie upon their death-beds to cry out for a little longer time; and no wonder, for they have the salvation of their souls to seek. O sad case! to have their work to do when the night is come, and a Christ to seek when death hath found them; take therefore the counsel of the Holy Ghost (Heb 3:7), 'To-day, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.' Mark, it is the Spirit's counsel. True, the devil and thine own heart will tell thee another tale, and be ready to whisper in thine ears, Thou mayest have time enough hereafter; what need of so much haste, another day may serve as well; let thy soul be filled with pleasure a little longer, and thy bags filled a little more; thou mayest <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> and that too. O, but this is the suggestion of an enemy, that would cause thee to defer so long, that thy heart may grow too hard, and thine ear too heavy to hear at all; but, certainly, this being the greatest business, challengeth the first and greatest care (Matt 6:33). And let this be done; then, if thou shalt either have so much time to spare, or a heart to do it, take thy time for the other.|$|E

Today the Swedish armed forces consists of contracted soldiers, soldiers who are employed full time and costs the armed forces a lot of money.

This has enabled us with a lower mass and cannot always perform the same tasks as we could before.

40|$|In El Paso-Ciudad Juarez, one of {{the largest}} twin cities on U. S. -MEX. border, I found that there are over about 10 {{thousands}} students and workers cross the border for school and work every day, which occupied a large percentage of 43 of the daily commuters on border. By this way, they obtain more job opportunities and better education resources. However, also because of it, they are caught in a dilemma. On one hand, they want to learn more, a survey shows that the situation of lacking basic skills like English and basic science is very serious in Mexico. An interview of student and worker commuters also reveals their great demands of learning basic skills. Students need these basic knowledge to catch up with their class, and for workers, {{they want to know what}} they are doing so that they can help themselves. However on another hand, they actually do not <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> self-developing learning. Every day they have to spend averagely 6 hours on bus and crossing the border, which means a terrible five-to-nine routine. Especially on the border crossing, they have to join the lines to cross the border and in maximum they could have a 2 hours delay here. This lost of time is directly linked to the lost of life quality. Commuters are too exhausted by the long-time transportation and have no time to join the basic life activities such as going to the active markets in Juarez, let alone developing themselves. These kinds of “border” situation then lead me to a design assignment that I want to build an efficient system that can turn their terrible routine into a time-saving one along with quality educational and social services.

This same thing is reflected in everything, we are talking about relations between neighbors friends, citizens in order, then it was important to create in them a awareness of how they are dealing with the problems of their home and how the disinterest of them is deteriorating each day more their relationship, because if the interest does not start for them it is very difficult for someone external to be interested in giving solution...|$|E
40|$|Undergraduate honors theses {{represent}} an intellectual asset that a university should recognize and manage as such. However, when theses were submitted exclusively in print copies, the work often faded into obscurity, forgotten by {{all but the}} student and mentor. While theses for advanced degrees have been accessible for many years via interlibrary loan or abstract services, similar access options have been unavailable for undergraduate theses because these works are most often associated with and maintained by the institutional honors program without involvement or support from the institution’s library system. At best, an index of undergraduate theses might {{be available to the}} public, but print copies—often the only versions of theses—are traditionally housed in honors and are difficult, if not impossible, to obtain. As undergraduate honors theses have become more commonplace and as online access to research has become virtually universal, honors programs do a disservice to their students, faculty, and the public if they do not provide access to the original scholarship produced by undergraduates. Furthermore, introducing undergraduates to electronic publication provides educational value by exposing them to the publishing demands they will likely encounter in their future education and professional careers. Two additional benefits to students are that an electronic publication saves the student time and expense in producing their final work and, most importantly, makes their work available worldwide to potential research partners and employers. An electronic thesis repository provides several instruction-based opportunities to advance learning. For example, courses within an honors college often enroll students from a variety of disciplines. In research methods courses, students can easily examine examples of theses to familiarize themselves with the writing styles and formatting in their discipline. Similarly, in a colloquium-style course that addresses diverse topics, students can use the repository to become familiar with research approaches and writing styles outside of their discipline; this is a particular advantage for undergraduates because, as they progress in their course of study and certainly once they begin graduate or professional programs, they rarely <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> type of cross-disciplinary interaction. In addition, faculty in diverse disciplines can assign repository reviews, either in courses or when mentoring honors students, to demonstrate the level of scholarship expected in honors thesis work. Although these goals could be accomplished using hard copies, our current students are more comfortable with and more likely to access electronically available materials. East Tennessee State University (ETSU) has made undergraduate theses available to the campus community and general public through an electronic repository and catalog maintained by the university library. The electronic system we implemented and others of similar quality provide a user interface developed for manuscript submission, review, and approvals. This type of system takes students’ research experience to a final level of completion and assures that they learn how to navigate a process analogous to manuscript submission. Because adapting our institution’s system for graduate theses and dissertations was not a feasible option and we could find no general guidelines to direct our efforts, we developed our own undergraduate honors thesis repository, and we hope that our efforts in this process will provide insights and guidelines for other institutions...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this Master's thesis is student {{participation}} in assessment in the Subject Norwegian for 3 rd Year of continuing education" (13 th grade). Specifically, how 3 rd year norwegian-teachers understand the term student participation in assessment {{and how they}} use it in practice, what challenges they experience in teacher-student relations connected with this and finally what the teachers think is required {{in order for them}} to succeed in involving and using the students in the assessment process. The topic and the research questions are viewed from a teacher perspective, and it is the thoughts, experiences and opinions of teachers that are presented. In order to get insight into the teachers' worlds I've used a qualitative method in the form of semi-structured interviews. The selection, the group of interviewees, consists of 6 of a total of 40 norwegian-teachers for 3 rd year in Sogn og Fjordane County. These represent 5 of a total of 10 Continuing Education schools (High school/Upper secondary) with University preparatory programs from different parts of the county. The results show that there are big differences in the individual teachers' understanding, approach and practice of student participation in assessment. Generally, most are unsure about what is meant by the term and don't view student participation in assessment used formatively as a significant factor in promoting learning in relation to the assessment process. Teachers view themselves as leaders and as assessment professionals, and feel that it is their task/responsibility alone to assess the work. Findings suggest that teachers lack knowledge of the potential for promoting learning through this type of assessment, and that they are not prepared to give students access to assessment at the 3 rd year level. At the same time, one can detect the start of a formative practice, but exams and expectations about a correlation between exam grades and end of year grades have a negative effect on the extent of the teachers' ability to facilitate this in practice. The culture of the feedback to students is much like a monologue with an emphasis on written feedback, despite teachers' feeling that verbal feedback and dialogue with the students is important and educational. Large class sizes are given as a reason why teachers don't <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> approach. Teachers point to the fact that the challenges related to students' participation in assessment aren't just a lack of facilitation, but also the students' own lack of commitment to their own learning, a tendency to abdicate responsibility. They claim that a lot of students don't want to participate, even though the opportunities are provided. Teachers feel that this type of assessment is time consuming and requires training and many are insistent that they need to be convinced of its usefulness before they implement it. Teachers view the teacher-student relationship as very important to learning and feel that it plays a part in student participation in assessment in the sense that students become more receptive to feedback. Teachers insist that the subject being taught has to be the foundation of that relationship, and they seek to find a balance between being an authority on the subject and caring about their students...|$|E
