5|$|Despite Space Races {{prominence}} as Atari's {{second game}} and the first after Pong, the 1973 arcade video game market was largely dominated by Pong clones; while Pong was the fourth arcade video game ever produced, Space Race was approximately the fourteenth, with nine Pong clones between them and mostly only other clones <b>filling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> rest of the year's releases.|$|E
5|$|The Hound Pits pub, {{which acts}} {{as a base for}} the player, was {{initially}} a larger structure. <b>Filling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> interior of the pub required too many stairs and rooms, and the large amount of climbing made navigation confusing. The team found retaining the large exterior they wanted while creating and disguising a smaller interior that was easier to traverse challenging. The pub's exterior was shrunk to resemble an Edwardian building, but the interior remained labyrinthine so Colantonio required that a chain be placed outside Corvo's bedroom, allowing him to reach the roof quickly. In frustration, the designers decided to simply close off the third floor entirely. The art team continued to receive requests throughout development, requiring them to extend pre-production {{until the end of the}} development cycle. Each design was hand drawn.|$|E
5|$|While {{the primary}} focus is on driver safety near {{railroad}} crossings, other basic driving safety rules are reinforced, such as not passing on hills or curves, not driving or pulling over when fatigued or sleepy and not being a distracted driver. Alan is also shown a police report of an accident where an acquaintance of his had died in an accident due to his reckless driving. <b>Filling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> film is a nostalgic {{look back at the}} early 1900s, when such things as horseless carriages were parts of everyday life and four-lane superhighways—in the late 1950s still a relatively new concept—weren't even thought of, and slower and less congested roadways meant fewer dangers in driving; however, Hal cautions that his point is that the human body hasn't changed and that even more attention to safety must be heeded.|$|E

5|$|In September 1967, {{the first}} {{successful}} Roundabout recruitment was Curtis' flatmate, the classically trained Hammond organ player Jon Lord; he had most notably played with The Artwoods, a band led by Art Wood, brother of future Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, and featuring Keef Hartley. At that time, Lord was playing in a band backing the successful pop vocalists The Flower Pot Men called The Garden, which also included bassist Nick Simper and drummer Carlo Little. Simper and Little were alerted by Lord of the Roundabout project and remained in standby for an eventual involvement. They recommended to Lord the guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, whose playing Chris Curtis had appreciated when his band The Searchers had played at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany. Blackmore {{had been a member}} of The Outlaws and had played as session and live musician with many beat, pop and rock acts, including Screaming Lord Sutch and the Savages, where he had met Little. Curtis contacted Blackmore to audition for the new group and persuaded him to move from Hamburg, where he was hanging out in local clubs. The guitarist came back to England for good to join the group in December 1967. Meanwhile, Curtis' erratic behaviour and his sudden loss of interest in the project he had started slowed down any development, forcing his financiers, HEC Enterprises, to drop him and entrust Lord and Blackmore with the task of <b>filling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> rest of the band.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War II the 10th Cavalry was relegated to caretaker duties at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. In 1942 the regiment was moved to Camp Lockett, California, replacing the 11th Cavalry in its duties as the southern defense of the Western Defense Command, under LTG DeWitt. 153 NCOs of this regiment would later be assigned to the newly organized 28th Cavalry Regiment forming its cadre, and <b>filling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> 4th Cavalry Brigade, which would remain in existence after the deactivation of the 2nd Cavalry Division, and its subsequent reactivation. In the summer of 1943, the 10th and 28th Cavalry Regiments fought wildfires in the Cleveland National Forest. In 1944, the entire 2nd Cavalry Division was shipped out to Oran, North Africa; where it disembarked and was deactivated on 9 March 1944. Although trained as combat soldiers, the soldiers of this regiment, and other regiments of the 2nd Cavalry Division were reorganized as combat support and combat service support units. Some would see combat as replacement soldiers of the 92nd Infantry Division.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Richard Childress Racing {{set out to}} win the Busch Series Owner's Championship {{with their}} 21 Car {{sponsored}} by The Hershey Company's PayDay brand. Cup driver Kevin Harvick was tabbed to drive 15 of the 34 races, with development driver Johnny Sauter <b>filling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> rest of the schedule. Harvick ended up running 19 races, with 3 wins and top tens {{in all but one}} race, and RCR became the first team to win an owner's points title with two different drivers. Since then, the presence of Cup drivers and teams has increased; RCR for example continued to run the 21 with Harvick as well as a full-time 29 car with Jeff Burton for the owner's championship, while the 2 car with Clint Bowyer won the driver's championship in 2008. Several other non-rookie Sprint Cup Series drivers, including Greg Biffle, Carl Edwards, J. J. Yeley, Denny Hamlin, and Reed Sorenson, began running the entire Nationwide schedule while also competing in a full season of Sprint Cup, even though on some weekends the two series competed at venues hundreds of miles apart.|$|E
25|$|The {{franchise}} {{celebrated its}} 10th anniversary in the OHL in 2004–05. The {{race for the}} central division title was close the entire year. By {{the end of the}} season the difference between first and fourth place was only four points. The Colts finished second in the central division; three points behind leaders Mississauga IceDogs, and one point ahead of Brampton Battalion and Sudbury Wolves. Second year player Bryan Little continued to build upon the success of his rookie season, scoring 36 goals and 32 assists for a total of 68 points. Third year Colt Hunter Tremblay was not that far behind, scoring a total of 62 points. <b>Filling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> Colts offence were the likes of Travis Fuller, Dan Speer, and B.J. Crombeen. Rookie defencemen Andrew Marshall, Nathan Martine, Todd Perry, and Nick Plastino, along with local brothers Andrew Hotham, and Scott Hotham would protect the Colts goal all season. Throughout the season, the Colts would make trades that brought in guys like high scoring overager Rob Hisey from the Erie Otters, young role players like Mike Roelofsen and Daniel Lombardi, and a proven goalie in Dan LaCosta. Heading into the playoffs the Colts would look to have plenty of promise for the present, as well as the future. In the playoffs that year the Colts lost a disappointing first round series to the eventual Memorial Cup semi-finalist Ottawa 67's.|$|E
