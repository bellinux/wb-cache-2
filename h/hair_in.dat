5|$|Long hair is a hairstyle {{where the}} head hair {{is allowed to}} grow to {{considerable}} length. Exactly what constitutes long hair can change from culture to culture, or even within cultures. For example, a woman with chin-length <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> some cultures {{may be said to}} have short hair, while a man with the same length of <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> some of the same cultures would be said to have long hair.|$|E

5|$|Hoshino {{thought that}} in a Victorian setting, {{long-haired}} girls tended to become the central character. After considering this, she believed a short-haired girl would stand out more and be much cuter. However, her editor wanted the character to have long hair, believing this would be better received by readers. As a result, Lenalee has long <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> the early chapters of the manga. Nevertheless, Hoshino took advantage of Lenalee's fight against the Level 3 Akuma to generate an impact strong enough to cause her to lose some of her <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> the process. Hoshino paid the most attention to Lenalee's uniform wanting to design clothing that would be sexually appealing. As a result, her uniform included a mini-skirt. However, Hoshino notes that the design does not fit with the manga's setting and states that {{it is best to}} treat Lenalee's uniform as fan service.|$|E
5|$|In the Muslim world, {{it seems}} the trend of hair styles is now favouring short over long in men. In the past, Bedouin Muslims often wore their <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> long braids, but {{influences}} from the Western world have caused a change in attitudes. Bedouins are now {{less likely to have}} long hair. Islamic countries in North Africa such as Egypt view long <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> men as modernist and in one case the Egyptian police viewed it as Satanic and a sign of an infidel. Spanish rulers during the Medieval Period suspected long-haired males to be Moors or Moriscos, therefore long hair was forbidden since it was believed to be a Moorish custom. However, modern North African men have adopted Western short hair.|$|E
5|$|P. l. mesopotamica or Mesopotamian lion, flourished {{during the}} Neo-Assyrian Period (approximately 1000â€“600 BC). It {{inhabited}} the Mesopotamian Plain where it probably represents a distinct sub-species. Nearly all ancient Mesopotamian representations of male lions demonstrate full underbelly <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> which until recently was only {{identified in the}} Barbary lion (Panthera leo leo) from Northern Africa and in most Asiatic lions (P. l. persica) from captivity in colder climates. Ancient evidence from adjacent landmasses reveal no substantiation for lions with underbelly <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> this manner so that the distinct phenotype of depicted lions in ancient Mesopotamia (including Babylon, Elam and ancient Persia) represent an extinct sub-species. Many of the images of these lions are derived from lion hunting sculptures so that the extinction of this sub-species likely resulted from overhunting {{in the ancient world}} (See the Cultural significance below).|$|E

40|$|Root hairs are {{important}} sites for nutrient uptake, especially in P limiting conditions. Here we provide first insights into root hair {{development for the}} diverse root types of rice grown under different conditions, and show the first in situ images of rice root <b>hairs</b> <b>in</b> intact soil. Roots of plants grown in upland fields produced short root hairs that showed little responsiveness to P deficiency, and had a higher root <b>hair</b> density <b>in</b> the high P condition. These results were reproducible in rhizoboxes under greenhouse conditions. Synchrotron-based in situ analysis of root <b>hairs</b> <b>in</b> intact soil further confirmed this pattern of root <b>hair</b> formation. <b>In</b> contrast, plants grown in nutrient solution produced more and longer root <b>hairs</b> <b>in</b> low P conditions, but these were unequally distributed among the different root types. While nutrient solution-grown main roots had longer hairs compared to upland field-grown main roots, second order lateral roots did not form any root <b>hairs</b> <b>in</b> nutrient solution-grown plants. Furthermore, root hair formation for plants grown in flooded lowland fields revealed few similarities with those grown in nutrient solution, thus defining nutrient solution as a possible measure of maximal, but not natural root hair development. By combining root hair length and density as a measure for root hair impact on the whole soil-grown root system we show that lateral roots provided the majority of root hair surface...|$|R

5|$|In Southeast Asia and Indonesia, male {{long hair}} was valued in until the seventeenth century, when the area adopted outside {{influences}} including Islam and Christianity. Invading cultures enforced shorter hairstyles on men {{as a sign}} of servitude, as well. They were also confused at the short hairstyles among women in certain areas, such as Thailand, and struggled to explain why women in the area had such short hair. They came up with several mythical stories, one of which involved a king who found a long <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> his rice and, in a rage, demanded that all women keep their hair short.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not always}} easy to predict a grown Appaloosa's color at birth.

Patterns {{sometimes}} change {{over the course of the}} horse's life although some, such as the blanket and leopard patterns, tend to be stable. Horses with the varnish roan and snowflake patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth, developing more visible spotting as they get older.|$|E
