Counterfactuals serve a preparative function, and help people avoid past blunders. Counterfactual thinking also serves the affective function {{to make a}} person <b>feel</b> <b>better.</b> By comparing one's present outcome to a less desirable outcome, the person may <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> about the current situation (1995). For example, a disappointed runner who did not win a race may <b>feel</b> <b>better</b> by saying, [...] "At least I did not come in last." ...|$|R

500|$|In the Kurma Purana, Sita prays to Agni {{just when}} Ravana arrives to kidnap her. Agni creates Maya Sita – an exact double of Sita – {{who takes the}} place of Sita and is {{abducted}} by the demon. While Sita is taken by Agni to heaven, Maya Sita is confined in Lanka. After Ravana's death, when Maya Sita enters the fire at Agni Pariksha, Agni restores the real undefiled Sita to Rama; meanwhile Maya Sita is destroyed in the blaze. The Chaitanya Charitamrita, a biography of the Vaishnava saint Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486–1533), by Krishnadasa Kaviraja (b. 1496) alludes to the Kurma Purana tale. Chaitanya meets a brahmin Rama devotee in Madurai. The brahmin is devastated after learning that [...] "mother Sita, mother of the universe and the supreme goddess of fortune" [...] was stained by Ravana's touch and gives up food. The saint consoles the brahmin saying that Sita's spiritual form can not be touched by the demon; it was Maya Sita that was taken away by Ravana. The brahmin <b>feels</b> <b>better</b> and accepts food. Chaitanya then travels to Rameswaram, where he listens to the Kurma Purana and obtains the authoritative proof to comfort the brahmin. He returns to Madurai with the Kurma Purana manuscript, leaving that brahmin overjoyed.|$|E

Regarding the recording process, vocalist and guitarist Jim Adkins stated: [...] "We used tape {{for the first time}} in a long time, as well as computer. I hate saying more raw, but it's more raw and warm. We just set up all around Alain's house. There were instruments in his bedroom and drums in his living room. Just noise all day long. There was less an emphasis on it being clean and perfect. There's a lot of stuff that's more about the performance than it sounding pristine.
