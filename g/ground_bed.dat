40|$|The mining {{industry}} uses {{a large amount}} of electric power. Their equipment is subject to extreme environmental conditions and mechanical shock. A significant number of electrical accidents are a result of improperly grounded electrical equipment. Federal regulations require the safety <b>ground</b> <b>bed</b> resistance to be measured once a year or after modifications for the Metal/Nonmetal Mining Industry. Coal mine regulations require connection to a low resistance ground medium. A ground resistance measurement can be accepted as evidence of compliance with these regulations. Most commercially available instruments used to measure the <b>ground</b> <b>bed</b> resistance require the ground conductor to be disconnected and the power system disconnected for safety reasons. The “fall of potential ” method requires auxiliary ground rods and approximately two hours to complete the test. Although a new instrument was initially thought to measure the <b>ground</b> <b>bed</b> resistance immediately without isolating the <b>ground</b> <b>bed,</b> field tests have shown this method is not accurate.

40|$|Abstract - One of {{the main}} {{purposes}} of grounding systems is to safely inject fault currents into the soil; such currents flow through any buried conductive objects (e. g. other earth electrodes) eventually present along their path. As a result, even though grounding systems may be metallically isolated, they become coupled due to {{the flow of the}} earth-current and interferences occur. Due to this unwanted coupling, dangerous potentials may arise over the "passive" electrode, which may expose persons to the risk of electric shocks. This paper proposes a semi-analytical approach to evaluate mutual interactions among grounding systems at low frequency, and establishes criteria to evaluate their actual independence. A significant study of interactions between the substation grid and the safety <b>ground</b> <b>bed</b> in a mining installation is quantitatively discusse...|$|E
40|$|The Polish {{delegation}} {{signed the}} UN International Convention on the Law of the Sea in December 1982 and its ratification is being prepared now. This international act is evaluated as a compromise, as it often happens with international problems of economic* exploitation, of the sea, of its <b>ground</b> (<b>bed)</b> {{and of the}} riches underneath the sea bed. The author of the present contribution presents some critical remarks concerning {{the concept of the}} (so-called) Sea Bed Authority, and particularly of the Sea Bed Enterprise, which are supposed to be organs of the United Nations Organization, and ergo are to be considered as subjects of international public Law. At the same time these organs are supposed to enter into commercial contracts with contractors and suppliers of various goods, services and know-how, both private, State owned or mixed companies, whether national or transnational. The UN Convention introduces also new words and phrases in international law which are derived from commercial activity in trade and industrial production, but have no counterpart in commercial law, id est a branch of private law. There is no transmission from this private law to relations regulated by international public law. ln consequence the prescriptions of the Convention {{do not seem to be}} practical enough and, even if the Convention will be ratified by a sufficient number of states to make it enforcable, the chapter on exploitation of the sea bed and its underground will have to be conceived in a different way.

To date over 375 rodent flight experiments with translational application have been archived by the Ames LSDA office. This knowledge base of fundamental research can be used to understand mechanisms that affect higher organisms in microgravity and help define additional research whose results could lead the way to closing gaps identified by the Human Research Program (HRP). This poster will highlight Ames contribution to the existing knowledge base and how the LSDA can be a resource to help answer the questions surrounding human health in long duration space exploration. In addition, it will illustrate how this body of knowledge was utilized to further our understanding of how space flight affects the human system and the ability to develop countermeasures that negate the deleterious effects of space flight.

The suppressive effects on ovarian cyclicity are mimicked by a mitogenic agent purified from the <b>ground</b> corncob <b>bedding</b> material (corn mitogen; CM), which stimulates the proliferation of estrogen receptor (ER) -positive (MCF- 7 cells) and ER-negative (MDA-MD- 231 cells) breast cancer cells. Purified CM does not compete for [(3) H]estradiol binding to ER or nuclear type II sites, {{and its effects on}} MCF- 7 breast cancer cell proliferation are not blocked by the antiestrogen ICI- 182, 780. These results suggest that the active component is unlikely to be a phytoestrogen, bioflavonoid, mycotoxin, or other known endocrine-disrupting agent that modifies cell growth via ER or type II [(3) H]estradiol binding sites. CM also stimulates the proliferation of PC- 3 human prostatic cancer cells in vitro, and the growth rate of PC- 3 cell xenografts is accelerated in nude male mice housed on ground corncob as opposed to pure cellulose bedding. Consequently, this endocrine-disrupting agent in <b>ground</b> corncob <b>bedding</b> may influence behavioral and physiologic reproductive response profiles and malignant cell proliferation in experimental animals.

40|$|In {{the civil}} {{engineering}} practice, construction operations in loose and high compressibility soils require {{the application of}} compressed sand cushions. Recently, {{there has been a}} substantial decline in the use of compacted ground beddings in the practice of industrial and civil engineering. This can be partly explained by the weaknesses of the existing calculation methods that may often generate higher values of the size of compacted cushions (width and thickness) and, consequently, cause a substantial increase in their cost. It is noteworthy that the existing methods of calculation do not take account of strength and deformation characteristics of the cushion material in the course of identification of the cushion size and their operating bearing capacity. However, the studies implemented by different authors suggest the possibility of reducing the size of compacted soil cushions applied to loose and high compressibility soils. Therefore, the most effective are the pads reinforced by high-strength reinforcing elements (as geo-textile, geo-grids, etc.) The author elaborates on the possible methods of expanding the scope of compacted <b>ground</b> <b>bedding</b> in the practice of industrial and civil construction.
