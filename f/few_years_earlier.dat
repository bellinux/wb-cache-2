5|$|Authors Joyce Murdoch and Deb Pryce {{say another}} {{effect of the}} case was a {{softening}} of the Court's attitude towards the gay community. Jacobson was the first such person to come before the Court to receive even the slightest empathy from it, and even a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier</b> his case might have been doomed from the start on that basis alone.|$|E
5|$|Paynter {{developed}} an increasing fan base as people followed the Zayat family's social media updates, drawing comparisons {{to the struggle}} of Barbaro a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier.</b> Both Ahmed and Justin Zayat sent out regular tweets and the hashtag #PowerUpPaynter was used to help organize updates to the public. Paynter received handmade posters from children and hundreds of get well cards.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{expansion}} of the British Empire, a similar approach was also gaining popularity in Britain. An Anglicised interpretation of Islamic architecture is exemplified by the Brighton Royal Pavilion, completed in 1823, and the Sezincote House, completed a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier.</b> Both these buildings drew heavily on the Islamic motifs, which were later to be evident at the Vorontsov Palace and were new and novel designs {{at the time of the}} Prince's visit to England.|$|E

5|$|Her next {{role was}} not as helpful to her career. She {{appeared}} in the 1950 musical comedy Dance Me a Song, {{which turned out to}} be a flop, though it was choreographed by Agnes de Mille, who had won acclaim for Oklahoma! a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier.</b> As one of the play's principal stars, she appeared in several scenes, but the choreography was ravaged by critics, as was the play, and reviews of her performance were mixed.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{after his}} {{accession}} to the throne, George V ordered {{the revival of}} the Installation ceremony, perhaps prompted by the first Installation ceremony of the more junior Order of St Michael and St George, held a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier,</b> and the building of a new chapel for the Order of the Thistle in 1911. The Installation ceremony took place on 22 July 1913 in the Henry VII Chapel, and Installations have been held at regular intervals since.|$|E
5|$|In the Rights of Men, Wollstonecraft {{not only}} endorses republicanism, {{but also a}} social {{contract}} based on sympathy and fellow-feeling. She describes the ideal society in these terms: individuals, supported by cohesive families, connect with others through rational sympathy. Strongly influenced by Price, whom she had met at Newington Green just a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier,</b> Wollstonecraft asserts that people should strive to imitate God by practicing universal benevolence.|$|E
50|$|Whitfield was {{a member}} of the Puget Sound Conference and was for a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>early</b> in his career, the {{superintendent}} of the Alaska Mission and was a pastor in Skagway, Alaska before moving to Washington State.|$|R
40|$|The {{early career}} {{researcher}} is a PhD student or postdoc, who {{has only been}} in their field of research for a <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> <b>Early</b> career researchers may be a force for change in research processes and technologies, flexible and willing to experiment with new systems, but this effect may be moderated by the more conservative researchers who work with, {{and in some cases}} supervise, them. ...|$|R
50|$|Paul Adams {{divorced}} Vollmer {{upon returning}} from military service. Reportedly, he was appalled by her {{drug use and}} group of friends. In 1945 Jack Kerouac introduced her to Benzedrine, which she used heavily for a <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> <b>Early</b> in 1946, she began a long-term relationship with Burroughs. The match was initially set up and encouraged by Allen Ginsberg, who much admired Burroughs’ intellect and considered Joan his female counterpart.|$|R
5|$|Kauri gum {{was used}} commercially in varnish, {{and can be}} {{considered}} a type of copal (the name given to resin used in such a way). Kauri gum was found to be particularly good for this, and from the mid-1840s was exported to London and America. Tentative exports had begun a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier,</b> however, for use in marine glue and as fire-kindlers; gum had even made up part of an export cargo to Australia in 1814.|$|E
5|$|Nine new garages {{were built}} {{at the end of}} the pit lane, {{replacing}} the four temporary garages that had been built a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier.</b> The additional garages allowed the ACO to increase the number of entries it could grant from 50 to 55. The paddock behind the garages was also re-organized with more facilities added for spectators, including more shops, new landscaping, and the Audi Tower monument.|$|E
5|$|Pope Paul III and His Grandsons {{ranks as}} one of Titian's finest and most {{penetrating}} works. Although unfinished and less technically accomplished than his Portrait of Pope Paul III of a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier,</b> it is renowned for its rich colouring; the deep reds of the tablecloth and the almost spectral whites of Paul's gown. The panel contains subtle indications of the contradictions in the character of the Pope, and captures the complex psychological dynamic between the three men.|$|E
50|$|Though Adil quit music after a <b>few</b> <b>years,</b> his <b>early</b> music {{education}} {{prepared him for}} his acting and performing career in musical theatre in his later life.|$|R

50|$|Both the Vincent and the Fidelity Building were {{designed}} by architect Charles W. Nichol. The Fidelity was constructed by M.W. Stock & Sons Construction Company {{at a cost of}} $256,000. The adjacent streets were widened to accommodate the increased traffic, and other buildings were constructed nearby over the next <b>few</b> <b>years.</b> <b>Early</b> occupants of the building included the Fidelity Health & Accident Insurance Company (the namesake of the building) the Michigan Fruit Growers' Association, and the Chamber of Commerce.|$|R
5|$|Carney was {{appointed}} U.S. Ambassador to Sudan on 27 June 1995 {{during a period}} of turmoil in U.S.-Sudan relations. Osama bin Laden had fled Saudi Arabia for the safe confines of Khartoum a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier,</b> and Sudan's alleged harboring and abetting of Muslim extremists on its soil was attracting attention of counterterrorism experts in the United States and abroad. Carney's tenure as ambassador followed a tumultuous period during which his predecessor, Donald K. Petterson, had been forced to draw down embassy staff by half and send their families back to America when terrorist threats were made against U.S. diplomats stationed in Khartoum.|$|E
5|$|During {{the making}} of Greed, the {{production}} company merged into Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, putting Irving Thalberg {{in charge of the}} production. Thalberg had fired Stroheim a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier</b> at Universal Pictures. Originally almost eight hours long, Greed was edited against Stroheim's wishes to about two-and-a-half hours. Only twelve people saw the full-length 42-reel version, now lost; some of them called it the greatest film ever made. Stroheim later called Greed his most fully realized work and was hurt both professionally and personally by the studio's re-editing of it.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, {{the number}} of {{attendees}} at St. Peter Church began to dwindle. Many of the priests who had served the congregation had been reassigned a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier.</b> In 1908, a popular priest, Father Sacchi, was sent to Mother of Sorrows Church in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania. Parishioners formed a committee to go speak to the Bishop on Father Sacchi's behalf. Although Father Sacchi {{was not allowed to}} return to St. Peter, Reverend James Vocca, who had also been at St. Peter prior to his reassignment, was brought back to the church.|$|E
50|$|Ruffner's views {{brought him}} into {{conflict}} with {{some members of the}} College and Lexington community, where relations were already strained because of conflicts between the missions of Washington College and the Virginia Military Institute and because of sectarian disputes. Ruffner tendered his resignation as president in 1848. He was replaced by George Junkin, then president of LaFayette College, who had lost his job at Miami University in Ohio a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>early</b> for his pro-slavery views.|$|R
5000|$|Kelly was a Sims Snowboards team rider for a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>early</b> in his career, but {{spent most}} of his life riding for Burton Snowboards. He was {{responsible}} for the design and development of many snowboards for the Burton Snowboards brand. The company's founder, Jake Burton, is quoted as saying, “When I started listening to Craig, that was when my company became successful and really took off.” He added, “… when the rest of the industry listened to Craig, that was when the sport really took off.” ...|$|R

5|$|In 1936, the American palaeontologists Walter Granger and William K. Gregory {{proposed}} that Forster-Cooper's Baluchitherium osborni was likely a junior synonym (an invalid {{name for the}} same taxon) of Paraceratherium bugtiense, because these specimens were collected at the same locality and were possibly {{part of the same}} morphologically variable species. William Diller Matthew and Forster-Cooper himself had expressed similar doubts <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier.</b> Although it had already been declared a junior synonym, the genus name Baluchitherium remained popular in various media because of the publicity surrounding Osborn's B. grangeri.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the breakup}} of the Soviet Union a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier,</b> the Russian economy had been slowly {{collapsing}} and the budget for space exploration was reduced by around 80%. Before and after Phase One, a great deal of Russia's space finances came from flights of astronauts from Europe and other countries, with one Japanese TV station paying $9.5 million to have one of their reporters, Toyohiro Akiyama, flown aboard Mir. By the start of Phase One, cosmonauts regularly found their missions extended to save money on launchers, the six-yearly flights of the Progress had been reduced to three, and there was a distinct possibility of Mir being sold for around $500 million.|$|E
5|$|The current uniform for Year 11 and 12 was {{introduced}} in 1966. It was designed by the senior students of 1965 and consists of a Black Watch kilt, white blouse, green blazer, green jumper or vest, black stockings for winter and bottle green knee-high socks for summer, and black leather lace-up shoes. Girls of Scottish origin are permitted wear the kilt pin representing their family or clan name, rather than the standard school pin. A green and Black Watch Tam o' Shanter (known as 'the Beret') was also introduced for all grades a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier.</b>|$|E
50|$|Steeple Aston had a {{small number}} of recusants in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries and {{a small number of}} Quakers in the 17th century. Methodist {{meetings}} were held in the home of one of the villagers for a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>early</b> in the 19th century but had ceased by 1817. Meetings were held in 1838 and 1839 to hear Primitive Methodist preachers and were well-attended despite uproarious organised protests. A Methodist chapel in South Street was opened in 1852. It was used for worship until 1968 when it was converted into a private residence.|$|R
5000|$|The {{distinctive}} fluid {{manner in}} which he rode was recognized and acclaimed in the snowboarding community. He was called a [...] "style master" [...] by TransWorld Snowboard Magazine editor Jon Foster. Kelly also appeared in {{an enormous number of}} video and photo shoots. He was known for looking straight at the camera, {{even in the midst of}} a difficult aerial manoeuvre. Craig was a Sims Snowboards team rider for a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>early</b> in his career, but spent most of his life riding for Burton Snowboards owned by Jake Burton Carpenter.|$|R
5000|$|Pollar emerged briefly from obscurity in 1966, at age 73. That year, a {{publicity}} event surrounding {{the premiere of}} NBC's Tarzan series brought together several actors who had played the apeman, and {{the guest of honor}} was James H. Pierce, then 66, who was dubbed the [...] "oldest living Tarzan". Pollar contacted the media and declared correctly that he himself was the oldest. [...] "Pierce is just a kid compared to me", he joked. Pollar blamed the mix-up on a New York City paper's erroneous report of his death a <b>few</b> <b>year</b> <b>earlier.</b>|$|R
5|$|The two thieves {{thwart the}} dacoits sent by Gabbar to extort the villagers. Soon afterwards, Gabbar and his goons attack Ramgarh during the festival of Holi. In a tough battle, Veeru and Jai are cornered. Thakur, {{although}} he has a gun within his reach, does not help them. Veeru and Jai fight back and the bandits flee. The two are, however, upset at Thakur's inaction, and consider leaving the village. Thakur explains that Gabbar had killed nearly all of his family members, and cut off both his arms a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier,</b> {{which is why he}} could not use the gun. He had concealed the dismemberment by always wearing a shawl.|$|E
5|$|A {{considerable}} leap {{in quality}} is evident here, {{compared to the}} Apostles {{of the church of}} Santa Maria dei Miracoli that had been carved just a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier.</b> The cycle of the Caesars is not only considerably grander in size but also a notable qualitative improvement over the previous production. The presence of these Caesars on the façade of the Loggia in Brescia is testament of an architectural and figurative leap, a full expression of classical art that has climbed from the earlier experiments at the Miracoli. Cairano, through the creation of the cycle and subsequent architectural ornamentation of the Loggia palazzo, becomes the fulcrum of commissions, both public and private, from Brescians keen to show off their descent from ancient Rome and to ride the wave of the local Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|By 1911 Germany {{had built}} battlecruisers of her own, and {{the superiority of}} the British ships could no longer be assured. Moreover, the German Navy did not share Fisher's view of the battlecruiser. In {{contrast}} to the British focus on increasing speed and firepower, Germany progressively improved the armour and staying power of their ships to better the British battlecruisers. Von der Tann, begun in 1908 and completed in 1910, carried eight 11.1-inch guns, but with 11.1-inch (283mm) armour she was far better protected than the Invincibles. The two s were quite similar but carried ten 11.1-inch guns of an improved design. , designed in 1909 and finished in 1913, was a modified Moltke; speed increased by one knot to , while her armour had a maximum thickness of 12 inches, equivalent to the s of a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>earlier.</b> Seydlitz was Germany's last battlecruiser completed before World War I.|$|E
