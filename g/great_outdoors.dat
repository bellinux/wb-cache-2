5|$|The {{garden was}} {{saved by the}} Member of {{parliament}} Albert Grant, who purchased the park in 1874 for £11,060 and donated it to the Metropolitan Board of Works. The title deed for the square passed to the succeeding public bodies {{and is now in}} the ownership of the City of Westminster. After the purchase, the architect James Knowles redesigned the park. A statue of William Shakespeare surrounded by dolphins was constructed in the centre. The four corner gates of the park had one bust each of famous former residents in the square: the scientist Sir Isaac Newton designed by W. Calder Marshall; Sir Joshua Reynolds, the first President of the Royal Academy by H. Weekes; John Hunter, a pioneer of surgery, by T. Wooler; and William Hogarth, the painter, by J. Durham. Ownership transferred to Westminster City Council in 1933. The most recent addition was a bronze statue of film star and director Charlie Chaplin, designed by sculptor John Doubleday in 1981. On the pavement were inscribed the distances in miles to several Commonwealth countries, including Canada, Kenya and Jamaica. After the <b>Great</b> <b>Outdoors</b> refurbishment of the square, only the statue of Shakespeare still remains.|$|E

40|$|Principles {{of fluid}} mechanics, gas–liquid mass transfer, and {{irradiance}} controlled algal growth are {{integrated into a}} method for designing tubular photobioreactors in which the culture is circulated by an airlift pump. A 0. 2 m 3 photobioreactor designed using the proposed approach was proved in continuous outdoor culture of the microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum. The culture performance was assessed under various conditions of irradiance, dilution rates and liquid velocities through the tubular solar collector. A biomass productivity of 1. 90 g l− 1 d− 1 (or 32 g m− 2 d− 1) could be obtained at a dilution rate of 0. 04 h− 1. Photoinhibition was observed during hours of peak irradiance; the photosynthetic activity of the cells recovered a few hours later. Linear liquid velocities of 0. 50 and 0. 35 m s− 1 in the solar collector gave similar biomass productivities, but the culture collapsed at lower velocities. The effect of dissolved oxygen concentration on productivity was quantified in indoor conditions; dissolved oxygen levels higher or lower than air saturation values reduced productivity. Under outdoor conditions, for given levels of oxygen supersaturation, the productivity decline was <b>greater</b> <b>outdoors</b> than indoors, suggesting that under intense outdoor illumination photooxidation contributed to loss of productivity in comparison with productivity loss due to oxygen inhibition alone.

40|$|Background: Indoor {{residual}} spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) {{are the key}} malaria {{vector control}} interventions in Ethiopia. The success of these interventions rely on their efficacy to repel or kill indoor feeding and resting mosquitoes. This study was undertaken to monitor human-biting patterns of Anopheles species in south-central Ethiopia. Methods: Human-biting patterns of anophelines were monitored for 40 nights in three houses using human landing catches (HLC) both indoors and outdoors between July and November 2014, in Edo Kontola village, south-central Ethiopia. This time coincides with the major malaria transmission season in Ethiopia, which is usually between September and November. Adult mosquitoes were collected from 19 : 00 to 06 : 00 h and identified to species. Comparisons of HLC data were done using incidence rate ratio (IRR) calculated by negative binomial regression. The nocturnal biting activities of each Anopheles species was expressed as mean number of mosquitoes landing per person per hour. To assess malaria infections in Anopheles mosquitoes the presence of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax circumsporozoite proteins (CSP) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: Altogether 3, 408 adult female anophelines were collected, 2, 610 (76. 6 %) outdoors and 798 (23. 4 %) indoors. Anopheles zeimanni was the predominant species (66. 5 %) followed by An. arabiensis (24. 8 %), An. pharoensis (6. 8 %) and An. funestus (s. l.) (1. 8 %). The overall mean anopheline density was 3. 3 times higher outdoors than indoors (65. 3 vs 19. 9 /person/night, IRR: 3. 3, 95 % CI: 1. 1 – 5. 1, P = 0. 001). The mean density of An. zeimanni, An. pharoensis and An. funestus (s. l.) collected outdoors {{was significantly higher than}} indoors for each species (P < 0. 05). However, the mean An. arabiensis density outdoors was similar to that indoors (11. 8 vs 9. 4 /person/night, IRR: 1. 3, 95 % CI: 0. 8 – 1. 9, P = 0. 335). The mean hourly human-biting density of An. arabiensis was <b>greater</b> <b>outdoors</b> than indoors and peaked between 21 : 00 and 22 : 00 h. However, An. arabiensis parous population showed high indoor man biting activities during bedtimes (22 : 00 to 05 : 00 h) when the local people were indoor and potentially protected by IRS and LLINs. All mosquito samples tested for CSP antigen were found negative to malaria parasites. Conclusions: Results show much greater mosquito human-biting activities occurring outdoors than indoors and during early parts of the night, implying higher outdoor malaria transmission potential in the area. However, high bedtime (22 : 00 to 05 : 00 h) indoor biting activities of parous An. arabiensis suggest high potential intervention impact of IRS and LLINs on indoor malaria transmission. </p...|$|R

There is compelling evidence that environmental factors {{play a role in the}} development of myopic refractive errors with a number of risk factors proposed, most recently <b>greater</b> time spent <b>outdoors</b> has been shown to be protective for the development of myopia. Despite the large volume of research in this area, there is still a considerable amount that is not well understood or well documented. The Sydney Myopia Study (SMS) was the first population-based study to document the prevalence of refractive errors in Australian schoolchildren. The Sydney Adolescent Vascular and Eye Study (SAVES), a 5 - 6 year follow-up of the SMS cohort was undertaken to determine the incidence of refractive errors and establish potentially causal factors for the development of myopia. The investigations contained in this thesis have demonstrated that the prevalence and incidence of myopia is low in Australian children. However, there is evidence of an increase in prevalence between birth cohorts. This thesis has also provided further evidence of the importance of environmental influences for refractive development and {{in particular}}, has shown that <b>greater</b> time spent <b>outdoors</b> is protective for the development of myopia in children, with this especially crucial at a young age. In addition we have documented variation in the prevalence of refractive errors between European Caucasian children living in Sydney and Northern Ireland as well as between secondary schools, with high academically achieving schools having a particularly high prevalence of myopia, which is potentially explicable by differences in environmental exposures. As a natural and modifiable protective factor, increasing the amount of time children spend outdoors has the potential to curb increases in the prevalence of myopia.
