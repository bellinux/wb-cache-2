3000|$|Based on the results, we can {{conclude}} that under no <b>high</b> <b>bias</b> or <b>high</b> <b>bias</b> condition, the oxygen molecular always acts as a key role to decrease the current. In air condition, the higher current caused by <b>high</b> <b>bias</b> can increase the concentration of carriers and enlarge the conduction channel along the nanowires, and the more electrons can easily cross the depletion layer near the surface of nanowire and combine with oxygen molecular, which reduces the electrical conductance of WO 3 nanowire. So, a [...] "sudden" [...] dropping current can be found when switching to a low bias as shown in Figure 4 c. Opposite, there is an absence of oxygen molecular in vacuum condition as the recombination centers to decrease the current as shown in Figure 4 d. Thus, a mechanism, combination of <b>high</b> <b>bias</b> and oxygen adsorption at the surface of WO 3 nanowire, can perfectly explain the phenomenon.|$|R

30|$|We {{present the}} {{electron}} transport in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) at <b>high</b> electric <b>bias</b> conduction. When graphene is patterned {{into a few}} tens of nanometer width of a ribbon shape, the carriers are confined to a quasi-one-dimensional (1 D) system. Combining with the disorders in the system, this quantum confinement can lead into a transport gap in the energy spectrum of the GNRs. Similar to CNTs, this gap depends on {{the width of the}} GNR. In this review, we examine the electronic properties of lithographically fabricated GNRs, focusing on the <b>high</b> <b>bias</b> transport characteristics of GNRs as a function of density tuned by a gate voltage. We investigate the transport behavior of devices biased up to a few volts, a regime more relevant for electronics applications. We find that the <b>high</b> <b>bias</b> transport behavior in this limit can be described by hot electron scattered by the surface phonon emission, leading to a carrier velocity saturation. We also showed an enhanced current saturation effect in the GNRs with an efficient gate coupling. This effect results from the introduction of the charge neutrality point into the channel, and is similar to pinch-off in MOSFET devices. We also observe that heating effects in graphene at <b>high</b> <b>bias</b> are significant.|$|R

At <b>higher</b> <b>bias,</b> the conductivity saturates and even decreases due to backscattering from optical phonons. The electron-phonon interactions are also responsible for the decay of the Fano factor at bias voltages V> 0. 1 V. The <b>high</b> <b>bias</b> electronic temperature has been calculated from shot-noise measurements, and it goes up to ∼ 1200 K at V= 0. 75 V.
