5|$|The active {{components}} of an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) are endonucleases called argonaute proteins, which cleave the target mRNA strand complementary to their bound siRNA. As the fragments produced by dicer are double-stranded, they could each in theory produce a functional siRNA. However, {{only one of}} the two strands, which is known as the guide strand, binds the argonaute protein and directs gene silencing. The other anti-guide strand or passenger strand is degraded during RISC activation. Although it was first believed that an ATP-dependent helicase separated these two strands, the process proved to be ATP-independent and performed directly by the protein components of RISC. However, an in vitro kinetic analysis of RNAi in the presence and absence of ATP showed that ATP may be required to unwind and remove the cleaved mRNA strand from the RISC complex after catalysis. The guide strand tends to be the one whose 5' end is less stably paired to its complement, but strand selection is unaffected by the direction in which dicer cleaves the dsRNA before RISC incorporation. Instead, the R2D2 protein may serve as the <b>differentiating</b> <b>factor</b> by binding the more-stable 5' end of the passenger strand.|$|E

Public Prosecutor (2010), the Court of Appeal had to {{determine}} the validity of a <b>differentiating</b> <b>factor</b> prescribed by the legislature for distinguishing between different classes of offenders for sentencing purposes. In that case, the <b>differentiating</b> <b>factor</b> {{was found in the}} Misuse of Drugs Act ("MDA"), which stipulated that an accused trafficking in more than [...] of diamorphine (heroin) would result in him or her facing a mandatory death penalty upon conviction. Following its previous decision in Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor (2005), which had applied Ong Ah Chuan, the Court applied the rational nexus test and found that the 15-gram differentia bore a reasonable relation to the social object of the MDA. The Court also noted that the [...] "quantity of addictive drugs trafficked is not only broadly proportionate to the quantity of addictive drugs brought onto the illicit market, but also broadly proportionate to the scale of operations of the drug dealer and, hence, broadly proportionate to the harm likely to be posed to society by the offender's crime." [...] Although Taw Cheng Kong was not cited in this case, the test applied was substantially similar to that which it enunciated in Taw Cheng Kong.|$|E

500|$|The {{effects of}} psychostimulants include {{increases}} in heart rate, body temperature, and sweating; improvements in alertness, attention, and endurance; increases in pleasure produced by rewarding events; but at higher doses agitation, anxiety, or even loss {{of contact with}} reality. Drugs in this group can have a high addiction potential, due to their activating effects on the dopamine-mediated reward system in the brain. However some can also be useful, at lower doses, for treating {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD) and narcolepsy.

[...] Cocaine can take effect in seconds if it is injected or inhaled in free base form; the effects last from 5 to 90 minutes.

[...] Methylphenidate taken in pill form, in contrast, can take two hours to reach peak levels in the bloodstream, and depending on formulation the effects can last for up to 12hours.

2500|$|To Clark Zlotchew, the <b>differentiating</b> <b>factor</b> {{between the}} fantastic and magical realism {{is that in}} fantastic literature, such as Kafka's story [...] "The Metamorphosis", there is a {{hesitation}} experienced by the protagonist, implied author or reader in deciding whether to attribute natural or supernatural causes to an unsettling event, or between rational or irrational explanations.

2500|$|Article 12(1) states: [...] "All {{persons are}} equal {{before the law}} and {{entitled}} to the {{equal protection of the}} law." [...] The Privy Council explained that the Article provides for all like persons to be treated alike, and prohibits laws that impose different punishments for individuals within the same class. However, the equality provision does not forbid discrimination in prescribing different punishments for different classes of individuals. These classes are differentiated by the circumstances of the offence committed. Such differentiation is consistent with Article 12(1) as long as the element that the Legislature adopts as the <b>differentiating</b> <b>factor</b> is not entirely arbitrary but bears a [...] "reasonable relation to the social object of the law".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{example of}} {{deviance}} {{from the source}} material is how Shakespeare characterises the rule of Antony and Cleopatra. While Plutarch singles out the [...] "order of exclusive society" [...] that the lovers surrounded themselves with – a society with a specifically defined and {{clear understanding of the}} hierarchies of power as determined by birth and status – Shakespeare's play seems more preoccupied with the power dynamics of pleasure as a main theme throughout the play. Once pleasure has become a dynamic of power, then it permeates society and politics. Pleasure serves as a <b>differentiating</b> <b>factor</b> between Cleopatra and Antony, between Egypt and Rome, and can be read as the fatal flaw of the heroes if Antony and Cleopatra is a tragedy. For Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, the exclusivity and superiority supplied by pleasure created the disconnect between the ruler and the subjects. Critics suggest that Shakespeare did similar work with these sources in Othello, Julius Caesar, and Coriolanus.|$|E

2500|$|Applying this {{reasonable}} relation test to the case, the Privy Council {{held that}} the mandatory death penalty was consistent with Article 12(1). This was because a reasonable relation exists between the social objective of the MDA and the <b>differentiating</b> <b>factor</b> – the quantity of drug involved in the offence. The objective of the MDA is to control the illicit drug trade, {{especially with regard to}} drugs that are highly addictive. This creates a social evil – one that the MDA seeks to prevent – which is said to be [...] "broadly proportional to the quantity of addictive drugs" [...] brought into the market. This accordingly justifies the severe punishment of the mandatory death penalty as it serves as a form of deterrence. In addition, Lord Diplock expressed the opinion that the appropriate boundary to be drawn between varying classes of persons is a question best left to the Legislature. He declined to comment on whether differences in circumstances justified the imposition of different punishments. Rather, the doctrine of separation of powers indicated that such [...] "questions of social policy" [...] are not within the purview of the judiciary. Since the appellants could not show that the differentiation amongst offenders {{on the basis of the}} quantity of the drug was arbitrary, the appeal on this ground was dismissed.|$|E
