Physiol. 2 I (I) : 2 95 - 2 98. 1966. -A miniature telemetry sys-tem including transmitter and sensor {{suitable for}} implanting in small animals to measure their {{deep body temperature}} has been designed. A compensating bridge circuit is used to achieve a stable and accurate measurement system. The high perform-ance, coupled with the small size and long battery life, makes the device valuable for long-term observation of an animal’s temperature rhythms. The device has a self-contained minia-ture battery that provides approximately 3, 600 hr operation. radio telemetry; temperature measurement; implanted tele-metry; long-term telemetry; small-animal telemetry; deep body temperature; <b>high-performance</b> <b>animal</b> telemetry A N IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION {{in the design of}} a temperature telemetry device is its ability to measure temperature change...|$|E
50|$|Two {{conflicting}} tendencies {{caused the}} current rarity of purebred, <b>high-performance</b> <b>animals.</b> The Pinzgauer is mainly bred as a beef suckler cow, {{so there is}} no selection on milk performance. However, there are utility crossings with local or distinct beef breeds, too. In Austria itself, since 1969, Red Holstein have been crossed into Pinzgauer to increase the milk performance. The aim is to achieve 6,000 kg milk with 4% milk fat content and 3.5% protein. The average milk performance in Austria is 5,356 kg milk with 3.89% milk fat and 3.28% protein (2005).|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to find the optimum {{inclusion}} level of palm kernel cake in sheep diet. We used 18 castrated rams, fed diets with inclusion levels of palm kernel cake of 0 %, 7. 5 %, 15 % and 22. 5 % of the total diet. Animals were housed in metabolic cages for 21 days. Data were subjected to regression study with 5 % significance for equations and regression coefficients. The inclusion of palm kernel cake caused reduction in DM, hemicellulose, NDF, CP, TDN, TC and MM (P 0. 05). The intake of EE and lignin increased (P< 0. 01). The fiber content of the diets added to the consumption of lignin by the animals caused reduction in digestibility of GE and all analyzed nutrients (DM, CP, hemicellulose, NDF; P< 0. 05). There was reduction in metabolizability of the diets due to increased GE of feces (P < 0. 01). Nitrogen balance was positive in all treatments. The inclusion of palm kernel cake above 7. 5 % in sheep diet causes reduction in DMI and digestibility of nutrients with possible performance losses, especially in <b>high-performance</b> <b>animals...</b>|$|R
40|$|Producers of {{domestic}} livestock strive to improve genetic influences in their herds. This requires identification, and propagation {{of animals that}} demonstrate desirable characteristics. The more animals available from which to select, the greater the opportunity to discover <b>high-performance</b> <b>animals.</b> Predetermination of the sex of offspring would provide {{a greater number of}} males or females from which to select the top individuals that will contribute the genetics to the next generation. Many attempts at sexing semen and identification of sex in preimplantation embryos have been mildly successful. However, recent advances in gene amplification enable investigators to use sex-specific probes to determine sex in only 1 cell removed from embryos. The biopsy method has had variable success in fresh embryos. However, manipulation of cryopreserved embryos reduces viability of the embryos (Bredbacka, 1998). Therefore, novel approaches to improve pregnancy rates may result in effective reproductive rates. One such approach is to vary the number of manipulated, cryopreserved embryos transferred into each recipient to increase the chances of successful pregnancy. The research performed identified the most successful techniques to biopsy and sex embryos using the mouse as a model animal. DNA from collected cells was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or sex specific probes to determine sex. Secondly, the most effective techniques were applied to cattle embryos and survival rates in micromanipulated, cryopreserved embryos were determined. Finally, recipients were implanted with one or two embryos that sex had been previously determined. Pregnancy rates, including the incidence of twinning, were recorded. The hypothesis tested was: a single method for sexing bovine cryopreserved embryos can yield high accuracy and high pregnancy rates for the desired sex...|$|R
40|$|Laryngeal {{hemiplegia}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common upper airway affections in horses. Laringoplasty is indicated in <b>high-performance</b> <b>animals,</b> and when the only complaint is noisy breathing, ventriculectomy and cordectomy can be performed. This study aimed to establish a minimally invasive surgical approach to ventriculocordectomy in horses, through a videoendoscopic procedure. The technique was developed in two stages, the first one was a cadaveric study and the second one was in vivo, both using two flexible endoscopes. A bilateral ventriculocordectomy was performed in two cadavers, totaling the removal of four vocal cords. In the second stage, a left unilateral ventriculocordectomy was performed in three animals with laryngeal hemiplegia. The vocal cords were pulled by one of the endoscopes with 3. 2 mm grasping forceps, while the second equipment was used for the resection of vocal cords with a flexible electrode adapted for monopolar electrosurgery (electrocautery). The average time for removal of the vocal cords was 23 ± 5 minutes. In the postoperative care, moderate inflammation around the surgical wound was observed, with complete healing in 21 days in one horse and 28 days in the other two. One animal presented exuberant granulation tissue on the surgical site. Other complications due to the tested technique were not noticed; therefore, it could be a less invasive option for ventriculocordectomy in horses. The developed technique proved to be effective for ventriculocordectomy execution in horses. The main advantages of this approach were reduced surgical time, shorter healing average time, no need for daily dressings and return to normal activities in a shorter period when compared to other surgical approaches. The limitation of the technique consists of the need for two endoscopes for its accomplishment. Further studies, with more animals, are needed to improve the technique...|$|R
50|$|The British Milksheep {{originally}} {{was known as}} the Alderbred and is a breed of domesticated sheep developed by Lawrence Alderson in Wiltshire and Northumberland. It was exported to several countries including Hungary, France and Greece, and from there other neighbouring countries. It now can be found mainly in the UK, Hungary and Canada, although the population in Britain was decimated during the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 2001. The exact composition of the breed has never been declared but it was based on <b>high-performance</b> <b>animals</b> in existing flocks of Dorset Horn, Bluefaced Leicester and Eastrip Prolific sheep kept by the Alderson family. Additional individual animals were selected from Lleyn, Texel and East Friesian breeds. Subsequent selection was based on measures of productivity, without regard for uniformity of appearance. A standardised breed type emerged gradually as the blending process continued. The animals were exposed to rugged conditions in the upper Pennines in northern England to develop robustness and adaptability. Progeny testing from the initial stages laid the foundation for continuous genetic improvement. Initially, total ownership of females of the breed was retained by the family and only rams were sold, but groups of females were released to other breeders in 1981. Numbers of flocks and animals increased rapidly and there were more than 5,000 breeding ewes by the mid-1980s with flocks widespread in Britain. A flock book was published in 1986. As the name of the breed suggests, it is a prolific milk producer, and several large dairy flocks were established. However, it is a robust, general-purpose sheep rather than a specialist dairy breed. It is known for its extremely high prolificacy, and rams are used to sire high-performance crossbred daughters. The quality of its carcase and wool are extra beneficial traits. In all countries outside Britain, the British Milksheep is used more as a dairying breed with dual-purpose qualities, but it is used also in most countries as a crossing sire; in Britain on hill and longwool breeds, in France in the Alps and Pyrenees on mountain breeds, in Greece on Chios dairy ewes, and in Hungary on the predominant Merino population. In France it has contributed {{to the development of the}} Boulonnais breed.|$|R

We showed that AHL inactivation activity, albeit with variable efficiency, was conserved in the serum samples of all the 6 tested mammalian <b>animals.</b> <b>High-performance</b> liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses revealed that mammalian sera had a lactonase-like enzyme(s), which hydrolyzed the lactone ring of AHL to produce acyl homoserine, with enzyme properties reminiscent of paraoxonases (PONs).

40|$|AbstractThe {{activity}} of antiviral nucleoside analogues like acyclovir {{is influenced by}} a number of cellular factors, one being the deoxythymidine (dThd) concentration. We therefore analysed the dThd concentration in human plasma and skin and in organs of guinea pig, the common experimental <b>animal.</b> <b>High-performance</b> liquid chromatography showed low amounts of dThd in human skin, 0. 20 – 1. 15 nmolg, whereas guinea pig skin and spleen had 20 – 30 nmolg and the concentration in guinea pig plasma was 10 -times higher than in human plasma. These animals are therefore in this respect less suitable as accurate models for antiviral nucleoside activity in humans...|$|R
40|$|The {{target of}} this study was to {{describe}} the interactions between the development of body condition in course of lactation and various descriptors of yield and fertility. Taking other investigations into consideration it was aimed to identify an optimal conditional range to be used in herd management which combines high milk yield with acceptable fertility traits and minimal health disorders. For this purpose, backfat thickness was measured by ultrasound at 46111 dairy cows on 78 different farms and was subsequently related to production variables. The development of body condition in course of lactation is influenced by parity, breed and average herd yield. Backfat thickness generally is lower for younger animals, especially in late lactation and in the dry period. With cows of third and higher parity growth effects disappear. On the other hand, those elderly animals are at higher risk of being overconditioned in late lactation. Negative energy balance is more intense and also more prolonged in Holstein-Friesians compared with crossbred german black pied x HF cows. Nevertheless those animals of high genetic merit generally manage to restore their energy reserves until subsequent parturition. In low-yielding herds attention particularly should be directed to adequate feeding and energy supply in relation to milk yield in late lactation and in the dry period. In some cases it can be beneficial taking the season-depending forage quality into consideration. Negative energy balance is getting more intense and prolonged with increasing milk yield. However a conditional nadir below 10 mm leads to decreasing milk production. Adequate feeding adjusted to milk yield seems to be a problem within herds. After depletion of nearly all their energy deposits <b>high-performance</b> <b>animals</b> are not able to restore an adequate amount of fat reserves until next parturition. On the other hand, the low-producing herdmates are predisposed to becoming excessively fat in late lactation. To reach a high production level without an increasing incidence of health disorders, conditional nadir should not decline below 13 mm RFD on herd average. Lower values only lead to negligibly higher milk yields but cause a distinctively higher risk of culling and an extreme energy deficit. High herd yields do not have to be at expense of reproductive performance and can be achieved without extreme body condition losses. The development of body condition in course of lactation is strongly related to the milk protein content. The average protein percentage of total lactational milk should range between 3, 5 and 3, 8 %. Values below 3, 2 % refer to an extreme energy deficit in early lactation. Dairy cows experiencing an intense negative energy balance post partum start lactation with elevated fat percentages, which decrease to values lower than average later in lactation. Intervals to first artificial insemination and to conception as well as calving intervals extend with increasing amounts of body fat losses in early lactation. Those animals losing the largest amounts of body fat and showing the longest intervals to conception conceive again about two months after returning to positive energy balance. On the other hand, those with only slight energy deficit become pregnant again around nadir of body condition. To achieve profitable reproductive performance, conditional nadir should not decline below 13 mm RFD on herd average, body fat loss in the first 4 weeks p. p. should not increase above 0, 14 mm per day. Body condition in the dry period and around parturition has a stronger influence on milk yield and solids in early lactation than on total lactational yield. Independent of dairy merit mean body condition in the dry period should range between 22 and 24 mm. Those cows show high reproductive efficiency and low culling risks later on. Condition scores above 35 mm RFD have to be avoided because of the highly increasing culling risk as well as decreasing milk production. Simultaneously excessive body fat reserves lead to longer intervals to first insemination. Conditional nadir should reach about 13 mm RFD. Lower values can increase individual milk yield related to herd average but at expense of higher culling risks and lower reproductive performance. Dairy cows should return to positive energy balance after a 100 days in milk maximum and another 100 days later a distinct regeneration of body fat reserves should be realised. At drying off, animals should have regained calving condition. However high producing dairy cows moderately have to gain body condition in the dry period, because replenishment of body energy reserves during late lactation becomes increasingly difficult. The validity of body condition scoring is limited concerning the individual, but it is a powerful management tool to assess the nutritional status of a dairy herd. It is a practical instrument in controlling the physiological loss of body fat reserves in early lactation and to allow the cow an adequate replenishment of body tissue reserves in anticipation of the subsequent lactation. An efficient herd management can offset depression in fertility, which commonly is combined with an increasing milk yield. Standard curves throughout lactation to be used in dairy herd management are in figure 57 and 58...|$|R
40|$|Angiotensin II (ANG II) {{causes a}} {{systemic}} pressor effect when {{injected into the}} cerebral ventricles. in the rat fourth ventricle, the effective doses for the ANG II pressor effect are over 100 times larger than in the systemic circulation. Considering the discrepancy of doses, the possibility that ANG II may reach the systemic circulation and promote pressor effects, following injection into the fourth ventricle, was investigated. the effects on blood pressure of different vasoactive peptides that produce pressor responses when injected into {{the central nervous system}} were compared. Dose-response curves were obtained for intravenous or fourth cerebroventricular injections of ANG II, lysyl-vasopressin (LVP), bradykinin (BK), or endothelin- 1 (ET- 1). the ED 50 ratios for intracerebroventricular/intraveneous injections were 110 for ANG II, 109 for LVP, 0. 01 for BK, and approximately 0. 4 for ET- 1. in cross-circulation preparations, pressor responses occurred in the donor rat following injection into the fourth cerebral ventricle of the recipient animal, showing that effective doses of ANG II, administered to the fourth cerebral, reach the systemic circulation. the same results were obtained for the microinjection of 4 nmol of LVP into the fourth cerebral ventricle of recipient <b>animals.</b> <b>High-performance</b> reverse-phase liquid chromatography analyses of arterial blood showed that approximately 1 % of the [I- 125]ANG II injected into the fourth cerebral ventricle may be recovered from the systemic circulation a few seconds after the microinjection. the systemic administration of the ANG II receptor antagonist losartan blocked the response to ANG II injected into the fourth ventricle whereas antagonist administration in the same ventricle did not. Angiotensin injections into the lateral ventricle produced pressor responses that were reduced by antagonist administration to the same ventricle but not by systemic administration of the antagonist. the data suggest that the pressor effect resulting from ANG II or LVP injections into the fourth cerebral ventricle {{may be due to the}} action of this peptide in the systemic circulation. On the other hand, the pressor effect due to ANG II microinjection into the lateral ventricle apparently results from the direct stimulation of central periventricular structures.
