40|$|This paper firstly {{discusses}} why {{the economic}} growth in the Yangtze River Delta has been slowed down recently and suggests a need totransform the current input-based <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>pattern</b> into aninnovation-based one. Next, through our theoretical analysis, we find that the change of current <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>pattern</b> is just the innovative reallocationof production factors, and the new economic growth driven by innovation is mainly initiated by the transmutation of entrepreneurship. Finally, we test our belief with real-world evidence. It shows that the Delta has formed a mechanism in which entrepreneurship and human capital mutually promote each other. However, the interactive relationship between R&D expenditure and entrepreneurship has not been developed in general. In addition, excessive government interventions will do harm to the growth of entrepreneurs and economic development. ...|$|E

40|$|Through {{the last}} {{two and a half}} decades academia has {{realised}} that viable explanations of the rise and decline of nations in a world in dramatic economic and political change requires more than a static neoclassical model. Among the flourishing research on institutions as <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> determinants are the two distinct theories of Douglass North, the co-recipient of Nobel Prize in 1993, and Mancur Olson. Both scholars claim the universality of their approaches in explaining real world economic history. However, research on the differences in their theories and their applicability to small and remote countries, like New Zealand and Argentina, remains in its early stages. A more detailed investigation of conceptual differences may clarify particular <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> parameters, and may provide more empirical support for each theory. Thus, the research question is: Can the <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>patterns</b> of New Zealand and Argentina of the last quarter century be explained either by Douglass North’s ‘cultural heritage’ hypothesis or by Mancur Olson’s ‘country-specific economic policy’ hypothesis? Firstly, an in-depth literature review of Douglass North’s and Mancur Olson’s latest academic work is conducted. Based on the examination of commonalities and differences in their terminologies and concepts, a conceptual framework for further empirical tests is derived. The framework is used to evaluate New Zealand’s and Argentina’s <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>patterns</b> in order to address the abovementioned research question. The assessment of the literature reveals that both scholars share the notion {{of the role of the}} state in providing well-defined individual property rights, low transaction cost levels, and well-developed national capital markets to achieve <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> potential. They ascribe growth-fostering characteristics to institutions of Britain and other relating democracies, while they see obstacles for economic success for Latin American countries. On the other hand, their propositions differ substantially in the foundation of economic policy and its ability to adjust over time. The findings of the empirical research show that institutions play a major role. However, the proposed differences in the aforementioned indicators exist only to a limited extent. An enhanced understanding is obtained that New Zealand’s and Argentina’s <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>patterns</b> cannot be solely explained neither by North’s nor Olson’s theory. A combination of both theories and further amendments might account more accurately for the actual economic histories of the two countries...|$|R

In other words, one should not expect reforms to produce immediate effects on economic growth.

On the other, it is imperative to prepare to adapt to and to accept reduced growth rates similar to those experienced during neo-classical growth, which would be necessary for transition from the “low-hanging fruit” <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>pattern</b> of quantity into a productivity-centric model focused on quality.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedSince {{the end of}} the Korean War, both Koreas have maintained their military forces in a high state of readiness. Until recently, the strategic environment on the Korean Peninsula was largely determined by {{the quantity and quality of}} arms supplied by major allies. Since the late 1960 's, however, both North and South Korea have pursued policies to develop their own indigenous arms industries, expanded their defense budgets, and implemented military modernization programs. It is the hypothesis of this thesis that North Korea is more adversely affected by defense spending than South Korea. Although North and South Korea have structurally different economic systems, the same set of financial constraints apply for each. By paralleling military development and <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> <b>patterns</b> for both North and South Korea, evidence of different effects of defense spending on <b>economic</b> <b>growth</b> of the two countries can be determined.
