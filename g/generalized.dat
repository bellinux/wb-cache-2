50|$|The {{concepts}} of conservative and incompressible vector fields <b>generalize</b> to n dimensions, because gradient and divergence <b>generalize</b> to n dimensions; curl is defined only in three dimensions, thus {{the concept of}} irrotational vector field does not <b>generalize</b> in this way.|$|R

25|$|A matrix {{that is not}} {{diagonalizable}} {{is said to be}} defective. For defective matrices, {{the notion}} of eigenvectors generalizes to <b>generalized</b> eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues generalizes to the Jordan normal form.

25|$|An almost complex {{structure}} integrates to {{a complex}} structure if the half-dimensional subspace is closed under the Lie bracket.
