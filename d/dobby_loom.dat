50|$|With a <b>dobby</b> <b>loom,</b> all 254 {{possibilities}} {{are available at}} any time. This vastly increases the number of cloth designs available to the weaver. The advantage of a <b>dobby</b> <b>loom</b> becomes even more pronounced on looms with 12 shafts (4094 possible sheds), 16 shafts (65,534 possible sheds), or more. It reaches its peak on a Jacquard loom in which each thread is individually controlled.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>dobby</b> <b>loom</b> {{is a type}} {{of floor}} loom that {{controls}} the whole warp threads using a dobby head. Dobby is a corruption of [...] "draw boy" [...] which refers to the weaver's helpers who used to control the warp thread by pulling on draw threads. A <b>dobby</b> <b>loom</b> is an alternative to a treadle loom, where multiple heddles (shafts) were controlled by foot treadles - one for each heddle.|$|E
50|$|Dobby looms expand a weaver's {{capabilities}} and {{remove some of}} the tedious work involved in designing and producing fabric. Many newer cloth design techniques such as network drafting can only reach their full potential on a <b>dobby</b> <b>loom.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{products}} are manufactured using <b>dobby</b> <b>looms,</b> jacquard looms, and shuttle looms, which allow for state-of-the-art floral motifs, subtle shadows, and colour gradients. They hold ISO 9001-2000 certification by SGS.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dobby</b> <b>looms</b> first {{appeared}} around 1843, roughly 40 years after Joseph Marie Jacquard invented the Jacquard device {{that can be}} mounted atop a loom to lift the individual heddles and warp threads.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "Jacquard loom" [...] is {{somewhat}} inaccurate. It is the [...] "Jacquard head" [...] that adapts {{to a great}} many <b>dobby</b> <b>looms</b> that allow the weaving machine to then create the intricate patterns often seen in Jacquard weaving.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>Dobby</b> <b>loom</b> {{is a type}} {{of floor}} loom that {{controls}} all the warp threads using a device called a dobby. (The word dobby is a corruption of [...] "draw boy" [...] which refers to the weaver's helpers who used to control the warp thread by pulling on draw threads.) A <b>dobby</b> <b>loom</b> is an alternative to a treadle loom. Both are floor looms in which every warp thread on the loom is attached to a single shaft using a device called a heddle. A shaft is sometimes known as a harness. Each shaft controls a set of threads. Raising or lowering several shafts at the same time gives a huge variety of possible sheds (gaps) through which the shuttle containing the weft thread can be thrown.|$|E
5000|$|The Textile Graphics project then {{undertook}} {{the natural}} extensions to printed and knitted fabrics, and woven fabrics produced on a <b>dobby</b> <b>loom.</b> The algebraic {{formulation of the}} designs produced on a <b>dobby</b> <b>loom</b> is described in an ACM paper.Textile Graphics, known as GRITS (graphic interactive textile system) internally, was a precursor of today's tools that allow a personal computer user to [...] "paint" [...] closed areas of a design with color or patterns. The 1969 paper, [...] "Computation of connected regions in interactive graphics", addresses the problem of automatically identifying and labeling the connected regions formed by sets of closed curves - a general problem encountered in interactive computer graphics. The first patent subsumes this capability. The subsequent patent related to connected regions, enlarged {{the scope of the}} procedure to arbitrarily large designs.|$|E
50|$|Dobby is a {{woven fabric}} {{produced}} on the <b>dobby</b> <b>loom,</b> characterised by small geometric patterns and extra texture in the cloth. The {{warp and weft}} threads may be the same colour or different. Satin threads are particularly effective {{in this kind of}} weave as their texture will highlight the pattern.|$|E
5000|$|In {{for example}} Nelson, many mills were {{operated}} by The Nelson Room and Power Company, and the Walverden Room and Power Company. This allowed specialised companies to start up. Such a company, may have 20 <b>dobby</b> <b>looms,</b> {{and just do}} [...] "fancies".|$|R
25|$|The Lancashire Loom was {{the first}} {{semi-automatic}} loom. Jacquard <b>looms</b> and <b>Dobby</b> <b>looms</b> are looms that have sophisticated methods of shedding. They may be separate looms, or mechanisms added to a plain loom. A Northrop Loom was fully automatic and was mass produced between 1909 and the mid-1960s. Modern looms run faster and do not use a shuttle: there are air jet looms, water jet looms and rapier looms.|$|R
50|$|Jacquard looms, {{although}} relatively {{common in}} the textile industry, are not as ubiquitous as <b>dobby</b> <b>looms</b> which are usually faster and much cheaper to operate. However, unlike jacquard looms, they are not capable of producing so many different weaves from one warp. Modern jacquard looms are controlled by computers {{in place of the}} original punched cards, and can have thousands of hooks.|$|R
50|$|A manual dobby uses a {{chain of}} bars or lags {{each of which has}} pegs {{inserted}} to select the shafts to be moved. A computer-assisted <b>dobby</b> <b>loom</b> uses a set of solenoids or other electric devices to select the shafts. Activation of these solenoids is under the control of a computer program. In either case the selected shafts are raised or lowered by either leg power on a dobby pedal or electric or other power sources.|$|E
50|$|Eccleshill has {{a number}} of mills.The Old Mill on Victoria Road was a woollen mill built in 1800 but was {{destroyed}} by fire in 1816.The present building on the site is dated 1863 although parts of it date back to the early 1800s.On the other side of Victoria Road from the Old Mill is a row of houses and street once known as Dobby Row - a dobby being part of an early form of weaving loom - a <b>Dobby</b> <b>loom,</b> itself taking its name from a corruption of the words 'draw boy' - a weaving assistant.|$|E
50|$|Two {{different}} shedding {{methods were}} {{developed for the}} harness loom-one where any one harness or combination of harnesses was lifted while the other harnesses remained stationary. This type of loom {{is known as a}} rising shed loom, and examples include the table loom, <b>dobby</b> <b>loom</b> or the Jack loom. The other method used in harness looms is where some harnesses are raised while others are lowered. The second method lessened the effort of lifting the selected harnesses because they no longer needed to be raised as high as in a rising shed loom. Counterbalance and countermarch looms are of this second type.|$|E
5000|$|The {{machines}} made by {{the firm}} included: Silk looms, circular and drop-box looms, fustian looms, Turkish towel <b>looms,</b> jacquard <b>looms,</b> <b>dobby</b> <b>looms,</b> Bradford looms, sheeting, linen and sailcloth looms, etc., for weaving all kinds of cotton, linen, worsted, silk, flax, hemp, jute, and woollen goods of various widths and strength - principally shirtings, jaconets, domestic tablecloths, twills, sheetings, counterpanes, checks, ginghams, quiltings, toilet cloths, handkerchiefs, Turkish towels, fustians, nankeens, cotton velvets, bedticks, cambrics, drapers, hucks, damask, towels, &c. Also all kinds of preparing machinery, viz., slasher sizing machines, pirning machines, beaming machines, cloth folding and measuring machines, hydraulic cloth presses, steam drying machines, &c.|$|R
50|$|The mill was {{powered by}} a low breastshot water wheel, 5 ft in {{diameter}} driving the machinery through line shafting. There are currently 15 looms in total, 10 Tappet looms dating to 1890-1932, 3 <b>Dobby</b> <b>looms</b> dating to the 1950s and 2 1960s Hattersley looms acquired in 1972. These days the looms are powered by individual electric motors. In addition there is a warping mill and winding frames also dating from the 1890s.|$|R
50|$|Next {{process in}} the textile {{production}} is fabric manufacturing. Fabric Manufacturing laboratory has variety of weaving machines from hand loom to high speed air jet loom. This laboratory consist of dobby and jacquard hand <b>looms,</b> <b>dobby</b> and jacquard shuttle looms, terry towel <b>looms,</b> rapier <b>dobby</b> and jacquard <b>looms,</b> air jet loom, sectional warping machine and sizing machine.|$|R
50|$|A {{computer-controlled}} <b>dobby</b> <b>loom</b> {{takes this}} {{one step further}} by replacing the mechanical dobby chain with computer-controlled shaft selection. In addition {{to being able to}} handle sequences that are virtually unlimited, the construction of the shaft sequences is done on the computer screen rather than by building a mechanical dobby chain. This allows the weaver to load and switch weave drafts in seconds without even getting up from the loom. In addition, the design process performed on the computer provides the weaver with a more intuitive way to design fabric; seeing the pattern on a computer screen is easier than trying to visualize it by looking at the dobby chain.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company was}} {{incorporated}} in 1924 but claims it can trace its roots to the 16th century. In the 1910s, it traded {{under the name}} of [...] "B. H. Moxon & Sons" [...] and was located at Springfield Mills, Kirkburton, near Huddersfield. At that time it patented an improvement to the <b>dobby</b> <b>loom.</b> It was incorporated in 1924 In the 1930s, it was exporting to Japan and the United States. In 1950, it moved to a new 60000 sq ft site in Kirkburton.In the 1950s, it was noted for its fancy worsted fabrics, In the 1980s, it was specialized in worsted mohair and silk blends aimed primarily at the Japanese market.|$|E
50|$|Another {{advantage}} to a <b>dobby</b> <b>loom</b> {{is the ability}} to handle much longer sequences in the pattern. A weaver working on a treadled loom must remember the entire sequence of treadlings that make up the pattern, and must keep track of where they are in the sequence at all times. Getting lost or making a mistake can ruin the cloth being woven. On a manual dobby the sequence that makes up the pattern is represented by the chain of dobby bars. The length of the sequence is limited by the length of the dobby chain. This can easily be several hundred dobby bars, although an average dobby chain will have approximately fifty bars.|$|E

50|$|The {{exhibits}} {{were arranged}} {{to tell the}} story of wool manufacturing. The design was organized around a modular system of floor-to-ceiling posts and panels. The use of silk screens and photographic blow-ups, along with the use of color filled the galleries. The contents of the exhibit illustrated the transition from hand to machine technology in wool manufacturing. A ‘before’ and ‘after’ example was used at each stage in cloth production, from sheep-shearing to cloth-dyeing. The materials shown included artifacts, text blocks, illustrations, models, and replicas. Illustrations outnumbered the 3-dimensional objects by a ratio of 2 to 1. The exhibit contained less than 2 dozen artifacts that illustrated significant developments in textile technology. Among the machines on display were a wool picker, a double cylinder carding engine, a 200 spindle spinning jack, a two-harness plain loom, an automatic bobbin-changing <b>dobby</b> <b>loom</b> and a shearing machine.|$|E

40|$|Mass-production of songket utilising {{jacquard}} looms can swiftly {{diminish the}} songket weaving cottage industry. Investing in a jacquard or <b>dobby</b> <b>loom</b> {{can be expensive}} and thus may not be affordable for practical use in the cottage songket industry as traditional weavers tend to operate {{on a small scale}} basis in villages. This paper highlights the production of contemporary Malaysian handwoven songket which is currently being funded by Yayasan Tuanku Nur Zahirah (YTNZ). The YTNZ is a foundation founded under the royal patronage of her Majesty Tuanku Nur Zahirah, the reigning Queen of Malaysia. YTNZ aims to help under-privileged communities in Malaysia, particularly women, to gain reasonable and sustainable income from heritage-based cottage industries. This paper also discusses the activities that the foundation has facilitated and implemented to the successful commercialization of such innovative songket in new markets in order to ensure future growth and sustainability. Examples of the activities include modernization of processes, design adaptation, product innovation, training, quality enhancement and marketing will be discussed in detail in this paper as well. This contemporary Malaysian handwoven songket project also emphasises teaching and motivating young, inexperienced songket weavers to embrace science and creativity in producing value-added contemporary lightweight handwoven songket...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of interlinked, multi-layer fabrics and near net shape preforms for engineering applications, woven on a 48 shaft <b>dobby</b> <b>loom</b> using glass, aramid, and carbon continuous filament yarns is assessed. The interlinking was formed using the warp yarns. Two basic types of structure were used. The first used a single warp beam and hence {{each of the}} warp yarns followed a similar path to form four layer interlinked reinforcements and preforms. In the second two warp beams were used, one for the interlinking yarns which pass from the top to the bottom layer through-the-thickness of the fabric and vice versa, {{and the other to}} provide 'straight' yarns {{in the body of the}} structure to carry the axial loading. Fabrics up to 15 mm in thickness were constructed with varying amounts of through-the-thickness reinforcement. Tapered T and I sections were also woven, with the shaping produced by progressive removal of ends during construction. These fabrics and preforms were impregnated with resin and cured to form composite samples for testing. Using these two basic types of construction, the influence of reinforcement construction and the proportion and type of interlinking yarn on the {{performance of}} the composite was assessed...|$|E
