50|$|The organ {{is a large}} three-manual and pedal {{instrument}} with 46 speaking stops. It retains much pipework {{from the}} organ by Brice Seede of 1752, together with the fine case façade. Pedal pipes and mechanical stop-changing facilities were added by Holdich in 1852. In 1879 the instrument was rebuilt by Gray and Davison when it was moved from its original west gallery location to a north aisle organ chamber. Further additions {{were made in the}} 20th century: the organ was converted to pneumatic action by Adkins in 1931, a detached console with <b>electro-pneumatic</b> <b>controls</b> was installed in a further rebuild by Percy Daniel & Co. in 1965, and further alterations were made by Coulson in 1986.

50|$|Power {{signalling}} {{arrived in}} 1910 in Sydney Yard, with the commissioning of (Sydney) Station Box. This installation was <b>electro-pneumatic</b> and <b>controlled</b> from a miniature lever frame {{supplied by the}} McKenzie, Holland & Westinghouse Power Signal Co. of Worcester, England. Although the lines were not continuously track-circuited and absolute block telegraph remained between signalboxes, there was some control of signals by track circuit and treadle. Upon its replacement by a 432 lever pistol grip power frame in the new Sydney Station West signalbox in the late 1920s, the original miniature lever frame was divided into smaller sections for reuse at other locations. The disused 'Station Box' remained in position for decades after its retirement, but has now been demolished, along with its successor.|$|R

By 1900, 54 <b>electro-pneumatic</b> interlocking plants, <b>controlling</b> a total of 1,864 interlocking levers, were in use on 13 North American railroads. This type of system would remain one of two viable competing systems into the future, although it did have the disadvantage of needing extra single-use equipment and requiring high maintenance.|$|R

While the Class 15s also suffered problems with the Paxman engines, these were worse on Class 16 because inadequate ventilation resulted in frequent engine seizures.

The whole sub-class had steam heating boilers fitted, had the Blue Star <b>Electro-Pneumatic</b> multiple-working <b>controls</b> as found on many other BR classes. The Class 31/1s could be found on a variety of secondary and relief passenger duties as well as parcels and freight traffic. While used in East Anglia, with locos allocated to Stratford and March depots, they were found throughout the Eastern Region of BR with Finsbury Park sporting a large allocation along with the depots at Tinsley, Immingham and Thornaby. Locos were also allocated to Bristol Bath Road and Old Oak Common on the Western Region, where they could be found working passenger trains as far west as Barnstaple and Paignton. In the early 1980s Healey Mills and Bescot on the Midland Region also gained an allocation as replacements for Class 25s.|$|R

40|$|Advanced {{intelligent}} knee prosthesis for trans-femoral amputees {{requires a}} versatile control strategy and associated control algorithm. Control strategy was evolved by mapping surface EMG (SEMG) from four muscles of healthy lower limb of a unilateral trans-femoral amputee and knee flexion angles (KFA) during various phases of a gait cycle. The SEMG and KFA are calibrated to three walking speeds modes i. e., slow, normal and fast. Sensor mechanisms feeds real-time data to controller to generate an appropriate control output signal based on available knowledgebase which calculates the patient's gait parameters i. e., KFA and SEMG from associated muscles during the corresponding phase of walk. Important aspect of control strategy {{is the development}} of knowledgebase proves that the SEMG signal generates recognisable pattern for change in walking speed when signals were analysed in time and frequency domain.

Fast services were {{operated by a}} new design of four-car express unit corridored throughout including corridor connections pas the driving cabs. Restaurant facilities were provided in most trains and through passage for access was required. 48 such four-car units were built of which 19 were designated 4-RES with restaurant facilities, and the remainder 4-COR.

50|$|Hymeks {{also worked}} pickup {{freights}} throughout the Western Region as a mixed-traffic design and were used heavily on inter-regional passenger services.

To avoid these instances, the locomotive would invariably be dispatched back to the nearest Western Region tracks without delay. The Hymeks were capable of operating in multiple, but only with each other. The <b>electro-pneumatic</b> <b>control</b> system (coded “Yellow Triangle”) allowed only one trailing locomotive to be controlled (by one driver): some trains were operated by three locomotives (all {{at the front of the}} train), but in these cases only two locomotives were connected in multiple, the third having a separate driver.|$|E
50|$|The Czech {{physiologist}} Jan Peňáz {{introduced the}} vascular unloading technique on the finger in 1973 {{by means of}} an <b>electro-pneumatic</b> <b>control</b> loop. The control loop is shown in the block diagram: a cuff is placed over the finger, as it is the most suitable and an easily accessible region. Inside the cuff, the blood volume in the finger arteries is measured using an infrared light source (L) and a light detecting photocell (PC). The plethysmographic signal (PG) - the light signal compared to constant C1 - is an electronic measure for finger blood volume. PG is fed into a control unit having proportional-integral-differential characteristics (PID). The PID-signal is added to a constant set point (C2), amplified and fed to an electro-pneumatic transducer (EPT). EPT produces a pressure in the cuff, which, again, alters finger blood volume.|$|E
50|$|Included in the 1955 Modernisation Plan was the {{electrification}} of the SR Kent coast lines. The Tonbridge to Hastings {{line was}} excluded {{because of the}} restricted loading gauge; the Ashford to Ore line {{was included in the}} plan but not electrified. The lines were electrified at 750 V DC and Class 411 stock was built; some units contained a buffet car. These four-car units were similar to the 4Cor units, but using the standard Mark 1 coach design with EPB brakes and an <b>electro-pneumatic</b> camshaft traction <b>control</b> system. The two motor cars each had a pair of 250 hp motors. There were gangways within and between units. Class 414 - two-car compartment stock with a lavatory for second class in one of the cars and another for first class - was built for stopping services. For boat trains MLV motor luggage vans were built with two 250 hp motors, designed to work in multiple with Class 411. Powered from their batteries, they were able to work short distances on non-electrified sections.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) is {{designed}} for an <b>electro-pneumatic</b> clutch actuator <b>controlled</b> by two on/off valves with PWM. The areas of application of the clutch actuator is in Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) and Clutch-by-wire (CBW) systems in heavy-duty trucks. As with most automated systems in the automation industry safety is the main priority, and in a cybernetic point of view this means that robustness of the control systems is very important. Sliding Mode Controllers {{are known for their}} excellent robustness properties and the focus of this thesis is to validate these properties for this particular application. The robustness properties of the SMC also indicates that a simple design model is adequate and since the existing mathematical models for this system are quite complex some simplifications are introduced. The controller design is performed in two phases. First an ideal SMC is designed, but since this introduces discontinuities in the control law any practical implementation would give heavy chattering at the output from the controller. Therefore a continuous linear approximation to the discontinuity is introduced. This controller is known as a boundary layer controller and it will reduce the control chattering to an acceptable level. The ideal controller is proven to be asymptotically stable, while for the boundary layer controller ultimate boundedness is achieved and a linearisation is performed for the case of a constant reference and this analysis shows that the origin of the linearised system is a stable focus. This indicates that the boundary layer controller might also be asymptotically stable. Since only a positionmeasurement is available to the control system the rest of the system states must be estimated. Velocity and acceleration are simply estimated as the first and second order filtered derivatives of the position measurement. The pressure is estimated based on the equation of motion for the clutch actuator. Through computer simulations and experimental testing the SMC has shown satisfying tracking performance and very good robustness with respect to parameter variations. Comparisons with a PD and a Backstepping controller shows that the performance of the SMC is superior to the PD controller and absolutely comparable to the Backstepping controller, though they have different strengths and weaknesses and therefore yield rather different results. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{compressibility}} of the actuating fluid of a {{pneumatic drive}} (compressed air) leads to significant landing of the pneumatic cylinder piston {{at the time}} of stop and hold of the load, a constant component of which can fluctuate significantly for the holding period. There are a lot of factors, which {{have a significant impact on}} the landing value of piston. Those are: an initial position of the piston at its stop, which determines the volume of the an active area of the piston, a value of the constant load component {{at the time of}} stop and its variation for the holding period, a transfer coefficient of the position component of the load, an active area of the pneumatic cylinder piston, as well as reduction in atmospheric pressure, which can significantly affect the operation of the control systems of small aircrafts flying at high altitudes. To reduce the landing value of piston due to changing value of the constant load component for its holding period, it is proposed to use a hydraulic positioner, which comprises a hydraulic cylinder the rod of which is rigidly connected to the rod of the pneumatic cylinder through the traverse, a cross-feed valve of the hydro-cylinder cavities with discrete electro-magnetic control, and adjustable chokes. A programmable logic controller provides the hydraulic positioner control. At the moment the piston stops and the load is held the cross-feed valve overlaps the hydro-cylinder cavities thereby locking the pneumatic cylinder piston and preventing its landing. With available pneumatic cylinder-controlled signal the cross-feed valve connects the piston and rod cavities of the positioner hydro-cylinder, the pneumatic cylinder piston is released and becomes capable of moving. A numerical estimate of landing of the pneumatic cylinder piston and its positioning quality is of essential interest. For this purpose, a technique to calculate the landing of piston has been developed taking into consideration that different factors, which determine operation conditions of the pneumatic cylinder, have the impact on it. Experimental investigation of piston landing was conducted using the pneumatic cylinder with piston and rod diameters of 32 and 16 mm, respectively, at operating pressure of 0. 8 MPa. With a vertical arrangement of the pneumatic cylinder axis, the control weights of a dead-weight pressure-gauge tester created a constant component of the load and its variation, and an indicator with resolution of 0. 05 mm estimated a landing value. The article shows the calculated data of piston landing, which are in good compliance with the experimental results. To substantially reduce the piston landing for the holding period of the load varying in value and sign was designed a hydraulic positioner of pneumatic cylinder piston, and its operation quality is studied on the physical layout of <b>electro-pneumatic</b> <b>control</b> system operating in the discrete and tracking modes. For control system service, work programs of the programmable logic controller integrated in the control circuit of the hydraulic positioner in discrete mode, and, as a digital discriminator, in tracking mode are developed. In conclusion as a result of the research activities the article estimates the impact of factors on the quality of the load position at the time of its hold and notes a high efficiency of the hydraulic positioner of pneumatic cylinder piston both in discrete mode and in tracking one. </p...|$|E
