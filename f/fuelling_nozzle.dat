50|$|Nozzle Based Technologies : In this system, the <b>fuelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> has {{a reader}} mounted on it which, when {{inserted}} into the vehicles filler neck, reads the vehicles ID using near field or RFID technology. Once plagued by the breakage of wires running down the outside or inside of the hose from the reader to the FM Terminal, the latest generation use a radio link to pass the data making their use in a commercial environment a viable option. The advantage {{of this type of}} system is that the <b>fuelling</b> <b>nozzle</b> must be fully {{inserted into the}} vehicle before fuel starts to flow, and fuelling stops if the nozzle is removed, making on-site fuel theft into containers much more difficult. Unfortunately, it does nothing to stop off-site fuel theft and so should be coupled with anti syphoning technologies to complete the system.|$|E
