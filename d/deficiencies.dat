5000|$|Vitamin B1 <b>deficiency</b> (thiamin <b>deficiency)</b> {{can cause}} glossitis. Vitamin B2 <b>deficiency</b> (ariboflavinosis) can cause glossitis, along with angular cheilitis, cheilosis, {{peripheral}} neuropathy and other signs and symptoms. The glossitis in vitamin B2 <b>deficiency</b> {{is described as}} magenta. [...] Vitamin B3 <b>deficiency</b> (pellagra) can cause glossitis. Vitamin B6 <b>deficiency</b> (pyridoxine <b>deficiency)</b> can cause glossitis, along with angular cheilitis, cheilosis, peripheral neuropathy and seborrheic dermatitis. Folate <b>deficiency</b> (vitamin B9 <b>deficiency)</b> can cause glossitis, along with macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, diarrhea, fatigue and possibly neurological signs. Apart from pernicious anemia discussed above, any other cause of vitamin B12 <b>deficiency</b> can cause glossitis, which tends to be painful, smooth and shiny.|$|R

5|$|Oral {{administration}} of enzymes {{can be used}} to treat some functional enzyme <b>deficiencies,</b> such as pancreatic insufficiency and lactose intolerance.|$|E
5|$|Several hormone <b>deficiencies</b> {{associated}} with hypopituitarism {{may lead to}} secondary diseases. For instance, growth hormone deficiency is {{associated with}} obesity, raised cholesterol and the metabolic syndrome, and estradiol deficiency may lead to osteoporosis. While effective treatment of the underlying hormone <b>deficiencies</b> may improve these risks, it is often necessary to treat them directly.|$|E
50|$|Lecithin {{cholesterol}} acyltransferase <b>deficiency</b> (LCAT <b>deficiency)</b> is {{a disorder}} of lipoprotein metabolism.

5|$|The {{chelating}} {{ability of}} amino acids {{has been used}} in fertilizers for agriculture to facilitate the delivery of minerals to plants in order to correct mineral <b>deficiencies,</b> such as iron chlorosis. These fertilizers are also used to prevent <b>deficiencies</b> from occurring and improving the overall health of the plants. The remaining production of amino acids is used in the synthesis of drugs and cosmetics.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is achieved with {{magnetic resonance imaging}} and blood tests. Treatment is by the timely correction of hormone <b>deficiencies,</b> {{and in many cases}} surgical decompression is required. Many people who have had a pituitary apoplexy develop pituitary hormone <b>deficiencies</b> and require long-term hormone supplementation. The first case of the disease was recorded in 1898.|$|E
5|$|Well-known human vitamin <b>deficiencies</b> involve {{thiamine}} (beriberi), niacin (pellagra), vitamin C (scurvy), {{and vitamin}} D (rickets). In {{much of the}} developed world, such <b>deficiencies</b> are rare; {{this is due to}} (1) an adequate supply of food and (2) the addition of vitamins and minerals to common foods (fortification). In addition to these classical vitamin deficiency diseases, some evidence has also suggested links between vitamin deficiency and a number of different disorders.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} Devers took command, the Armored Force had two {{operational}} armored divisions: the 1st Armored Division at Fort Polk, Louisiana, and the 2nd Armored Division at Fort Knox, and one independent tank battalion, the 70th Tank Battalion at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. Both divisions {{participated in the}} large-scale war games of the Louisiana Maneuvers in August and September 1941, and the Carolina Maneuvers in November 1941. Despite some successes, the maneuvers revealed armored unit and equipment operational <b>deficiencies,</b> plus {{a general lack of}} combat readiness. Devers attributed much of the poor performance to poorly-trained junior and staff officers, but also saw doctrinal <b>deficiencies</b> that hampered the coordination of tanks, infantry and artillery.|$|E
5|$|Difficult {{situations}} {{arise in}} <b>deficiencies</b> of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis in people (both men and women) who experience infertility; infertility in hypopituitarism may {{be treated with}} subcutaneous infusions of FSH, human chorionic gonadotropin–which mimics the action of LH–and occasionally GnRH.|$|E
5|$|Hematinic <b>deficiencies</b> (vitamin B12, {{folic acid}} and iron), {{occurring}} singly or in combination, and {{with or without}} any underlying gastrointestinal disease, may be twice as common in people with RAS. However, iron and vitamin supplements only infrequently improve the ulceration. The relationship to vitamin B12 deficiency {{has been the subject}} of many studies. Although these studies found that 0–42% of those with recurrent ulcers suffer from vitamin B12 deficiency, an association with deficiency is rare. Even in the absence of deficiency, vitamin B12 supplementation may be helpful due to unclear mechanisms. Hematinic <b>deficiencies</b> can cause anemia, which is also associated with aphthous-like ulceration.|$|E
50|$|Galactose epimerase <b>deficiency,</b> {{also known}} as GALE <b>deficiency,</b> Galactosemia III and UDP-galactose-4-epimerase <b>deficiency,</b> is a rare, {{autosomal}} recessive form of galactosemia associated with a <b>deficiency</b> of the enzyme galactose epimerase.|$|R

5|$|In 1935, the {{new film}} studio Photo Chemical Laboratories, known as P.C.L. (which later became the major studio, Toho), advertised for {{assistant}} directors. Although he had demonstrated no previous interest in film as a profession, Kurosawa submitted the required essay, which asked applicants to discuss the fundamental <b>deficiencies</b> of Japanese films {{and find ways to}} overcome them. His half-mocking view was that if the <b>deficiencies</b> were fundamental, {{there was no way to}} correct them. Kurosawa's essay earned him a call to take the follow-up exams, and director Kajirō Yamamoto, who was among the examiners, took a liking to Kurosawa and insisted that the studio hire him. The 25-year-old Kurosawa joined P.C.L. in February 1936.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause is}} not {{completely}} understood, but involves a T cell-mediated immune response triggered {{by a variety of}} factors.

5|$|The {{pituitary}} {{develops in}} {{the third week of}} embryogenesis from interactions between the diencephalon part of the brain and the nasal cavity. The brain cells secrete FGF-8, Wnt5a and BMP-4, and the oral cavity BMP-2. Together, these cellular signals stimulate a group of cells from the oral cavity to form Rathke's pouch, which becomes independent of the nasal cavity and develops into the anterior pituitary; this process includes the suppression of production of a protein called Sonic hedgehog by the cells of Rathke's pouch. The cells then differentiate further into the various hormone-producing cells of the pituitary. This requires particular transcription factors that induce the expression of particular genes. Some of these transcription factors {{have been found to be}} deficient in some forms of rare combined pituitary hormone <b>deficiencies</b> (CPHD) in childhood. These are HESX1, PROP1, POU1F1, LHX3, LHX4, TBX19, SOX2 and SOX3. Each transcription factor acts in particular groups of cells. Therefore, various genetic mutations are associated with specific hormone <b>deficiencies.</b> For instance, POU1F1 (also known as Pit-1) mutations cause specific <b>deficiencies</b> in growth hormone, prolactin and TSH. In addition to the pituitary, some of the transcription factors are also required for the development of other organs; some of these mutations are therefore also associated with specific birth defects.|$|E
5|$|A 2010 {{study shows}} that along with some Bay Area freeways, some of BART's {{overhead}} structures could collapse in a major earthquake, which has a significant probability of occurring within three decades.
