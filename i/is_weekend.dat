The theoretical part deals with marketing and marketing communications with its typical instruments. Then I deal with advertising and the restrictions imposed on a person under 18 years of age. It is followed by description of the target groups, including the methods used to reach children and the impact of advertising on children's segment. In the next chapter, I resolved the eating habits of children and the trend in consumption of milk. The practical part deals with marketing research. Primary data were obtained by questionnaire survey. From the evaluated data I derived the conclusion that Granko <b>is</b> <b>weekend</b> breakfast trend today...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for solving a labor scheduling problem with several realistic days-off scheduling constraints and a cost structure {{that depends on}} the work sequence for each employee. The days-off scheduling constraints include the following: (1) each employee is assigned no more than three workdays per week, (2) each employee is assigned at least two consecutive off days per week, and (3) any work stretch cannot exceed four consecutive workdays. The sequence-dependent cost structure assumes that the daily wage of each employee depends on two factors: (1) whether the given workday <b>is</b> <b>weekend</b> or a regular workday, and (2) the sequence of work patterns assigned in previous days. A DP algorithm suited to instances of moderate size is used to determine the optimum work assignments that minimize the total labor cost, while satisfying the work demand under the stated constraints...|$|E
40|$|Reheat {{cracking}} is used {{to occur}} in HAZs of Cr-Mo steels during reheating {{at the time the}} grain boundary <b>is</b> <b>weekend</b> by the phosphorus segregation. In this research, the effects of applied stress, and reheating time and temperature on the grain boundary weakening were clarified on HAZ of 1 Cr- 1 / 2 Mo steel. A reheat cracking test and, metallurgical examination including grain boundary etching were carried out. Much attention was paid on the relation between the angle of each grain boundary line to the stress, and its phosphorus concentration. The following results were ontained. (1) In the temperature-raising process with a heating rate of 200 K/hr, phosphorus concentration of grain boundary becomes maximum at 823 K. (2) In the temperature-holding process in the range of 773 to 873 K, the maximum value of phosphorus concentration is observed at 823 K for 5 hours. (3) The phosphorus concentration is decreased by continuous heating up to 873 K or by holding at 823 K for a prolonged time. At this time period, the HAZ recovers from the weakened state. (4) The stress will intensity the phosphorus segregation in grain boundary by its direct action or by its indirect action of producing sliding at grain boundary. This mechanism was discussed in detail...|$|E

40|$|Background & Objective: The {{immune system}} of Patients with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) <b>is</b> <b>weekend</b> because of Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) infection, {{and they become}} vulnerable to several opportunistic and non-opportunistic pathogens and different carcinomas. IV drug abuse, sexual contact, occupational transmission, blood transfusion and maternal-fetal transmission are well known transmission routes for HIV infection. This study was under taken to investigate the prevalence of HIV transmission routs in the HIV infected population of Sirjan, and their knowledge about the disease, in order to plan better preventive strategies. Materials & Methods: A cross sectional study was planned. During a 6 -month period in 2010, all of the HIV infected people in Sirjan (old and new cases) who had a file at the consultation center for high risk behavior, completed a valid and reliable questionnaire. Results: The definite route of transmission was not clear {{in any of the}} patients because they had more than one suspicious route. Injected drug abusers were the most common (88. 4 %) followed by those who got tattoos (79. 1 %), invasive therapeutic procedures, dentistry, surgery and endoscopy (56. 1 %), high risk sexual behavior (62. 8 %), bloodletting (9. 3 %), injuries in the barbershop (9. 3 %) and blood transfusion (2. 3 %). Conclusion: All of the HIV infected cases in Sirjan were involved with several high risk behaviors, but the major route of transmission, similar {{to other parts of the}} country was injected drug abuse. Educational programs for prevention of AIDS should be followed seriously and special attention should be paid to groups with multiple high risk behaviors...|$|E
