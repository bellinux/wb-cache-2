500|$|It is also {{possible}} the Sydney punchbowls may have had other purposes – to promote the fledgling settlement and to encourage new settlers. In 1820, artist John William Lewin's patron, merchant Alexander Riley, {{looking for ways to}} promote the New South Wales colony, stated: [...] "It has long been a subject of our consideration <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>Country</b> <b>that</b> a Panorama exhibited in London of the Town of Sydney and surrounding scenery would create much public interest and ultimately be of service to the Colony". This purpose is clearly set forth even in the title of William Charles Wentworth's tome on New South Wales, which contained the engraving of Lewin's Sydney Cove painting. The full title ends [...] "...With a Particular Enumeration of the Advantages Which These Colonies Offer for Emigration, and Their Superiority in Many Respects Over Those Possessed by the United States of America". The punchbowls were also an opportunity to present the art of topographical panoramas {{in the form of a}} high status object and to portray the new colony in a more glamorous way than that of simply a remote convict colony as perceived at the time.|$|E

[...] Jim Webb, on the other hand, replied: [...] "As the president of the United States, every life in this country matters."

[...] Clinton had already met with Black Lives Matter representatives, and emphasized what she described as a more pragmatic approach to enacting change, stating [...] "Look, I don't believe you change hearts.
