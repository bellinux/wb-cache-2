40|$|Background and Objectives: Concern {{with the}} costs of blood safety is growing, which raises the {{question}} whether safety measures that reduce risk only marginally should be discontinued. Withdrawing such safety measures would allow reallocating resources to more efficient health care interventions, but it might raise moral objections. Materials and Methods: This study evaluates two ethical arguments why <b>discontinuing</b> blood safety <b>measures</b> would be more objectionable than not implementing them. The first argument is that whereas withdrawing protective measures causes harm to patients, not starting protective measures 'merely' omits to prevent harm. The second argument is that patients who benefit from protective measures are historically entitled to the continuation of those protective measures. Results: Both arguments are unconvincing. There is only a weak causal connection between removing blood safety measures and harms that transfusion recipients suffer. Moreover, patients are not entitled to the continuation of protective measures that prove very inefficient, unless applying these protective measures rectifies past injustice towards them. Conclusion: Unless stronger ethical objections can be found, blood system operators and regulators should be more willing to withdraw inefficient safety measures...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Several {{clinical}} studies have {{given rise to}} optimism about low-dose steroid treatment in patients with sepsis. It reduces time to shock reversal and may even {{have a positive effect on}} mortality. The pathophysiology of the relative adrenal insufficiency syndrome has not yet been determined, and the usefulness of basal and stimulated cortisol levels in diagnosing this syndrome is still uncertain. This review will examine recent evidence to elucidate these questions. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies performed in more than 1000 patients in intensive care show convincingly that in general serum cortisol levels are increased. Basal or stimulated cortisol levels are at best useful to predict mortality in patients in intensive care, not to decide which patients to treat or when to <b>discontinue</b> treatment. <b>Measuring</b> free cortisol concentrations rather than total cortisol concentrations in critically ill patients may lead to new research strategies to identify the mode of action of low-dose steroid treatment. SUMMARY: It has been shown that low-dose corticosteroid administration to catecholamine-dependent patients in septic shock results in shock reversal. There seems to be a relative shortage of cortisol, because low-dose hydrocortisone administration resulting in cortisol levels as much as four times the already increased levels results in shock reversal. Strong evidence for a positive effect on mortality is still lacking, perhaps because of the relatively low number of patients investigated. A very important topic in interpreting studies is that total (free plus protein-bound) cortisol has been measured. Future studies should also measure free cortisol concentrations, which could add to our knowledge of the pathophysiology and treatment of the relative adrenal insufficiency syndrome. On the basis of current knowledge, there is no evidence to support a treatment strategy based on a random or stimulated cortisol level. At the moment, rapid hemodynamic improvement of catecholamine-dependent patients after the administration of low-dose corticosteroids still seems the best available clue to diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{preprocessing}} circuit for ISFETs (Ion-sensitive field-effecttransistors) {{to measure}} hydrogen-ion concentration in electrolyte is presented. A modifiedflip-flop {{is the main}} part of the circuit. The modification consists in replacing the standardtransistors by ISFETs and periodically switching the supply voltage on and off. Concentration of hydrogen ions to be <b>measured</b> <b>discontinues</b> the flip-flop value symmetry,which means that by switching the supply voltage on the flip-flop goes to one of two stablestates, Ã¢Â€Â˜oneÃ¢Â€Â™ or Ã¢Â€Â˜zeroÃ¢Â€Â™. The recovery of the value symmetry can be achieved by changing abalanced voltage, which is incorporated to the flip-flop, to bring the flip-flop to a 50 %position (probability of Ã¢Â€Â˜oneÃ¢Â€Â™ equals to probability of Ã¢Â€Â˜zeroÃ¢Â€Â™). Thus, the balanced voltagereflects the measured concentration of hydrogen ions. Its magnitude is set automatically byusing a feedback circuit whose input is connected to the flip-flop output. The preprocessingcircuit, as the whole, is the well-known ÃŽÂ´ modulator in which the switched flip-flop servesas a comparator and a sampling circuit. The advantages of this approach in comparison tothose of standard approaches are discussed. Finally, theoretical results are verified bysimulations with TSPICE and a good agreement is reported...|$|R

60|$|Of Father Vaughan, who divided {{his time}} and his ghostly care between Osbaldistone Hall and about half a dozen mansions of Catholic gentlemen in the neighbourhood, I have as yet said nothing, for I had seen but little. He was aged about sixty--of a good family, as I was given to understand, in the north--of a {{striking}} and imposing presence, grave in his exterior, and much respected among the Catholics of Northumberland as a worthy and upright man. Yet Father Vaughan did not altogether lack those peculiarities which distinguish his order. There hung about him an air of mystery, which, in Protestant eyes, savoured of priestcraft. The natives (such they might be well termed) of Osbaldistone Hall looked up to him with much more fear, or at least more awe, than affection. His condemnation of their revels was evident, from their being <b>discontinued</b> in some <b>measure</b> when the priest was a resident at the Hall. Even Sir Hildebrand himself put some restraint upon his conduct at such times, which, perhaps, rendered Father Vaughan's presence rather irksome than otherwise. He had the well-bred, insinuating, and almost flattering address peculiar to the clergy of his persuasion, especially in England, where the lay Catholic, hemmed in by penal laws, and by the restrictions of his sect and recommendation of his pastor, often exhibits a reserved, and almost a timid manner in the society of Protestants; while the priest, privileged by his order to mingle with persons of all creeds, is open, alert, and liberal in his intercourse with them, desirous of popularity, and usually skilful {{in the mode of}} obtaining it.|$|R
5000|$|In 1800, James McGready {{stood at}} the {{juncture}} of two centuries, looking backward to the traditions of his spiritual fathers and forward to children of a new century in a young republic. The segment of the Second Great Awakening that arose from the concert of voices he led, stood {{in the shadow of}} the First, when republican ideals deferred to a king and revival fervor emanated primarily from the voices of preachers wearing clerical collars or holding seminary degrees. McGready witnessed both the fracturing and stagnation of Presbyterianism in Kentucky, as well as the flowering of new forms of religious expressions thriving at the grass roots, where Bible reading, hymn singing, camp meetings and revival preaching were primary expressions of religious piety and feeling, reflecting the doctrines of the new birth among the common people. Largely as a result of the revival, religion was less hierarchical and controlled than in the preceding century, as well as more democratic and diverse. As the number of evangelicals increased across the state, social changes in Kentucky were tangible as rationalism and deism, once perceived as threats by evangelicals, shrunk in public esteem. [...] The egalitarian sentiment that found expression during the revivals translated to an increase in the number of evangelicals who opposed slavery. The Cane Ridge congregation, for example, presented a strong anti-slavery petition to the Kentucky Presbytery, while other social concerns such as temperance initiatives and legislation regarding the Sabbath were also introduced in the wake of the revivals. The directions and destinations of the principal actors during the Revivals that spanned 1800-1801 were as varied as the evangelical expressions they fostered. Barton Stone, who had long harbored doubts about the doctrine of election, left the Presbyterians in 1804 and led a group calling themselves simply, “Christians.” He later joined the Disciples of Christ, a group begun by Alexander Campbell. In 1810, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church was established by several pro-revival Presbyterian ministers. By 1820, the new denomination had twice as many congregations in the Cumberland region as the original Presbyterians. It rejected many Calvinist doctrines and <b>discontinued</b> exclusivity <b>measures</b> in the observance of communion, while continuing to affirm the practice of circuit riding and camp meetings. Not surprisingly, Presbyterian membership suffered with the loss of many of its members to other denominations. Its numbers stagnated in the years between 1800 and 1820, while Baptist and Methodist membership soared to as much as tenfold from the time of the inception of the Logan County revivals, outpacing the rate of population generally. [...] By the end of 1801 alone, the Baptists were already boasting a tripling of their members [...] But as some groups and traditions grew, others diminished; by 1830, Presbyterian Scots-Irish sacrament observances had largely become a thing of the past, even as Baptist association meetings and Methodist camp meetings proliferated through the nineteenth century.|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "As the responsible DOD agency for leading, advocating, and coordinating all DOD efforts to defeat improvised explosive devices (IED) the Joint IED Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) was directed to develop DODs counter-IED strategic plan in February 2006 under DOD Directive 2000. 19 E. As previously recommended by GAO, JIEDDO has made several attempts to develop such a plan, but its strategic-planning actions have not followed leading strategic-management practices or have since been discontinued. For example, JIEDDOs 2007 strategic plan did not contain a means of measuring its performance outcomesa leading strategic-management practice. In addition, JIEDDOs 2009  2010 strategic plan contained performance <b>measures,</b> but JIEDDO <b>discontinued</b> using these <b>measures</b> because it later determined that the measures were not relevant to the organizations goals. Although DOD tasked JIEDDO to develop its counter-IED strategic plan, DOD has not translated DODs counter-IED general mission objective of eliminating IEDs as a weapon of strategic influence into actionable goals and objectives. JIEDDO issued a new counter-IED strategic plan in January 2012; however, the new plan {{does not apply to}} all other counter-IED efforts departmentwide, only to those managed by JIEDDO. Consequently, JIEDDOs new strategic plan alone will not provide the means necessary for determining the effectiveness of all counter-IED efforts across DOD. Further, as JIEDDO implements its plan, it will continue to face difficulty measuring effectiveness until DOD establishes and provides results-oriented goals to accompany its general mission objective. Without actionable goals and objectives established by DOD, JIEDDO and other DOD components cannot tie individual performance measures to DODs desired outcomes. As a result, DOD and external stakeholders will be left without a comprehensive, data-driven assessment as to whether their counter-IED efforts are achieving DODs mission and will not be informed about the overall effectiveness of its counter-IED efforts or use of resources as they relate to DODs mission. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Inadequate {{treatment}} {{practices with}} antimalarials are considered major contributors to Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine, pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine. The longitudinal survey conducted in Dielmo, a rural Senegalese community, offers a unique frame {{to explore the}} impact of strictly controlled and quantified antimalarial use for diagnosed malaria on drug resistance. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted on a yearly basis a retrospective survey over a ten-year period that included two successive treatment policies, namely quinine during 1990 - 1994, and chloroquine (CQ) and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) as first and second line treatments, respectively, during 1995 - 1999. Molecular beacon-based genotyping, gene sequencing and microsatellite analysis showed a low prevalence of Pfcrt and Pfdhfr-ts resistance alleles of Southeast Asian origin {{by the end of}} 1994 and their effective dissemination within one year of CQ and SP implementation. The Pfcrt resistant allele rose from 9 % to 46 % prevalence {{during the first year of}} CQ reintroduction, i. e., after a mean of 1. 66 CQ treatment courses/person/year. The Pfdhfr-ts triple mutant rose from 0 % to 20 % by end 1996, after a mean of 0. 35 SP treatment courses/person in a 16 -month period. Both resistance alleles were observed at a younger age than all other alleles. Their spreading was associated with enhanced in vitro resistance and rapidly translated in an increased incidence of clinical malaria episodes during the early post-treatment period. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: In such a highly endemic setting, selection of drug-resistant parasites took a single year after drug implementation, resulting in a rapid progression of the incidence of clinical malaria during the early post-treatment period. Controlled antimalarial use at the community level did not prevent dissemination of resistance haplotypes. This data pleads against reintroduction of CQ in places where resistant allele frequency has dropped to a very low level after CQ use has been <b>discontinued,</b> unless drastic <b>measures</b> are put in place to prevent selection and spreading of mutants during the post-treatment period...|$|R
40|$|Georgia Law {{students}} {{selected as}} summer Sea Grant Legal Program fellows Monday, June 29, 2015 Congratulations to third-year student Joseph Patrick “J. P. ” Hackney and second-year student Emily C. Wyche, {{who have been}} selected as legal fellows with the Georgia Sea Grant Legal Program. The two students are spending 10 weeks as paid fellows during the summer working with legal and policy experts to address environmental questions facing policymakers in coastal Georgia communities. Hackney {{is working with the}} city of St. Marys in an effort to procure a favorable community rating under the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s new guidelines for flood insurance. The work involves identifying flood hazards and methods to reduce them by using city ordinances and other legal methods, with the goals of minimizing flood risk and resulting in lower flood insurance costs for the area. St. Marys is among the first group of Georgia’s coastal communities that is seeking be evaluated under FEMA’s new system. Successful strategies and resources utilized by this coastal town will be shared with other Peach State ocean front cities so they can enlist in FEMA’s Community Rating System and/or improve their scores. Hackney said his work in this area is like “a perfect circle” as it uses “good research by members of the coastal community that is distilled by legal minds” and then “shared with communities for practical implementation” that will benefit many, with the process repeating in future years. Additionally, Hackney is updating a water law chapter in a conservation law treatise. Wyche is working on identifying the changes made since 1997 to the Georgia Coastal Management Plan policies in order to inform federal facilities so they can work toward compliance with the updated state policies. She is researching legislative amendments, rules and regulations, in addition to court and administrative decisions to ensure the text is up to date. She is also conducting legal research related to the potential duties and liabilities of local governments in regard to taking adaptive measures like the maintenance of water and sewer services, roads, drainage, erosion and flood control works, among others, as well as what liabilities communities may face if they choose to <b>discontinue</b> such <b>measures</b> in flood-prone areas. As part of her work, Wyche participated in a stakeholder meeting in Brunswick, Georgia, regarding new legislation on marsh buffer zones. While there, she assisted in gathering information that the Environmental Protection Division will use to develop rules and regulations for new legislation. “[It] was a really fantastic learning experience because it provided a wide array of perspectives – from individuals concerned for the environment, individuals concerned about property rights and representatives from the Sierra Club and local enforcement agencies,” she said. The Georgia Sea Grant Legal Program is a partnership between Georgia Sea Grant and UGA’s Carl Vinson Institute of Government. Members of the team overseeing the work of the Sea Grant fellows include lawyers J. Scott Pippin (J.

40|$|This {{research}} analyzes how {{a telecommunications}} regulator can balance regulation with innovation, {{at a reasonable}} cost. This question has gained critical importance for telecom regulators as the unregulated Internet technologies such as voice and video over Internet disrupt the regulated traditional technologies such as telephony and television and the historical paradigm of the regulator. The existing U. S. telecommunications regulations were created in the integral age. In that paradigm, functional components that constitute a service compliant with regulation resided inside the network core; each operator was vertically integrated and controlled the total functionality necessary to deliver a service; a few such operators controlled the industry; they faced low competition and were under limited pressure to adopt innovation; and consumers had limited choice. The Internet has introduced a polar opposite paradigm-the modular age. In this paradigm, functional components that constitute a service are dispersed across the network core and edges; each firm controls only {{a subset of the}} total functionality necessary to constitute a service; many modular firms interoperate to deliver a service; firms compete fiercely and are under great pressure to innovate; and consumers enjoy far greater choice due to the multi-modal competition among multiple technologies. Although transitioning from an integral to a modular age dramatically flips the environment, the current regulatory response to this dramatic shift has been hesitant to shift its intellectual roots. Consequently, this thesis describes and analyzes the new telecommunications paradigm and explores its implications for an appropriate regulatory paradigm. The research uses the regulation of voice communications in the United States as a representative case. We analyze the new telecommunications paradigm as a dynamic complex system. Our research approach rests upon four principles of systems: two organizational principles (hierarchy and feedback) and two behavioral principles (emergent behavior and strategic and statistical behavior). The telecommunications system is viewed as one of the many subsystems that together fulfill the objectives of a society. The dynamics of the telecommunications system itself are conceptualized as those resulting from the interactions of four subsystems: regulatory dynamics, corporate strategy dynamics, consumer dynamics, and technology dynamics. The regulatory objectives to be fulfilled are conceived as an emergent property of such a system of systems. To carry out this research, we have developed a system-level dynamic feedback model and two case studies. As modular entrants of Internet-based technology disrupt integrated incumbents of traditional technology, bewildering dynamic complexity complicates decision-making by policymakers, managers, consumers, and technologists alike. Our model makes understandable the emergent behavior amidst the uncertainty that surrounds such a disruption phenomenon. The model formulations are behavioral. They are derived from the existing theories of technology and industry disruption, where possible. Alternatively, where theories have a gap, the decision processes of stakeholders, gleaned from unstructured interviews, are mathematised {{as the basis for the}} model formulations. The resulting structure is a fully endogenous systems model of regulation, competition, and innovation in telecommunications. In the first case study we analyze the regulatory environment of pre vs. post-Internet periods, both quantitatively and qualitatively. For the analysis, public comments in response to the Telecommunications Act of 1996 Notice for Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) are compared with those in response to the IP-Enabled Services NPRM published in 2004. The analysis demonstrates how the differences in the integral and modular age are reflected in the regulatory record. The second case study analyzes how market, technology, organizational, and regulatory uncertainties affect technology and industry disruption. For this case, we use a combination of industrial statistics and content analysis of media publications. The analysis demonstrates the limits to technology and industry disruption. The case studies complement the model in two ways: first, they facilitate further refinement of the systems model; second, they empirically validate the arguments deduced from model analysis. Through this research we answer three questions: (1) Can the regulatory structure designed in an integral age-in its objectives, obligations (requirements), and enforcement mechanisms-work for a modular age? (2) How can regulators and managers improve decision making amidst the uncertainty surrounding the disruption of an integrated technology and industry by a modular one? (3) What is the new role of the telecommunications regulator and how can it be fulfilled in the modular age of the Internet? Our analysis shows that the current regulatory structure is inadequate for responding to the challenges the modular age poses. Firstly, the current objectives are appropriate but cannot be met unless regulators discontinue the merely efficiencycentered thinking and begin to address objectives at the societal level. Secondly, the current obligations may attain short-term goals, but have undesirable long-term consequences. Devising obligations that are appropriate in the long-term requires regulators to <b>discontinue</b> myopic <b>measures</b> such as incremental regulation of new technologies. Finally, the current enforcement mechanisms are blunted by the dynamic complexity of the modular age. Enforcing regulations effectively in the modular age necessitates adding to the regulatory quiver new mechanisms that are more versatile than the merely adversarial command-and-control mechanisms. Through model analysis, we demonstrate how a lack of understanding of the various uncertainties, and misperceptions of feedback in a complex system where regulators, firms, consumers, and technologists constantly interact, could lead to decisions that are costly for regulators as well as managers. Yet, as we demonstrate, with better grasp of the dynamic complexity involved, they can significantly improve decision-making to meet the challenges of the modular age. We argue that the most critical role for the telecommunications regulator in the new telecommunications paradigm is to sustain a balance between regulation and innovation, at a reasonable cost. Achieving such a balance in a modular structure is not trivial because of several natural tendencies. First, achieving high compliance at low cost is difficult because in highly modular architectures and industries, coordination costs, such as the time to build consensus, can be inordinately large. Second, keeping the innovationlevel high is difficult because it requires fighting the natural tendency of modular firms to gain and abuse market power. We propose a combination of two policy levers-Limiting Significant Market Power (SMP) Accumulation and Building Broad-based Consensus around Regulatory Issues-that most effectively achieve the desired balance and remain inadequately explored in the United States. We contend that implementing these policy levers will require, first, a more broadly construed antitrust regulation in the United States that will ensure higher modularity, and, second, a telecommunications regulatory agency that is empowered and organized to pursue objectives at the societal level and to build broad-based consensus among divergent interests in a highly modular structure. by Chintan Vaishnav.
