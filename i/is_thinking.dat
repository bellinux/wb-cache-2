5|$|Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima {{stresses}} {{the dynamic of}} players' relationships with the main character in Final Fantasy games; thus, he puts significant thought into how that relationship will develop. With Final Fantasy VII, protagonist Cloud Strife's reserved nature led Nojima to include scenarios in which the player can select Cloud's responses to certain situations and dialogue. With Final Fantasy VIII, which also features a reserved lead protagonist in Squall, Nojima wanted to give players actual insight into what the protagonist <b>is</b> <b>thinking,</b> even while other characters remain uninformed: {{this led to the}} inner dialogues Squall has through the game.|$|E

25|$|It is {{relatively}} difficult {{to start a}} housing co-op because if the idea is, for instance, to build a building or group of buildings to house the members, this usually takes a significant mortgage loan for which a financial institution will want assurances of responsibility. It may also take {{a year or more}} for the members to organize the design and construction, as well as time and foresight to establish even basic organizational policies. It is rare that these kinds of skills of organization are available in a random group of people who often have pressures on their existing housing. It may be somewhat easier to organize a group of closely related housing units. This opportunity may arise, for example, if an existing apartment building's owner <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> about selling it.|$|E

500|$|Spike Lee {{first learned}} of the novel in 2004 and {{contacted}} McBride about making a film adaptation. [...] He felt that McBride was the perfect person to write the screenplay, believing that his novel {{would serve as a}} guide. Commenting on the difficult process of adapting his book into a screenplay, McBride stated, “As a novelist, you tend to think internally. You can guide what the character says and you can explore what he or she <b>is</b> <b>thinking.</b> Movies don't have time to explain. You have to get right to the muscle.” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{pilot is}} meant to be the [...] "template of the series". Kitsis {{confirmed}} that every week will contain flashbacks between both worlds, as they [...] "love the idea of going back and forth and informing what the character is missing in their life." [...] The writers' desire to present a [...] "mash up" [...] of many small characters can be seen in a scene of the pilot, {{in which there is a}} war council featuring Geppetto, Pinocchio, and Grumpy. Horowitz elaborated, [...] "One of the fun things for us coming up with these stories <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> of ways these different characters can interact in ways they never have before." ...|$|E

500|$|Angel is {{the student}} council {{president}} at the afterlife school. This places her {{at odds with the}} SSS as her responsibilities require her to suppress delinquency and other disruptive activities that the team does. The SSS initially calls her [...] "Angel" [...] since they do not know her real name, but they still refer to her by it even after finding out her real name to be Kanade Tachibana. It is difficult to understand what she <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> due to her rarely showing any outward emotions and her way of talking bluntly. She is personally dedicated to helping others overcome their regrets and pass on. However, she often lacks a proper understanding of others, as she never thinks to try to explain to the SSS why she was doing what she did. She enjoys eating mapo doufu, a spicy dish.|$|E

[...] Garcia previewed his character's flashback in a New York Post interview, [...] " [...] the kind of relationship Hurley has {{with his father and}} how it's changed from {{when he was a kid}} now that he's an adult and a lottery winner. He finds something on the island that brings him back to that time and that's how it all gets started". Actor Josh Holloway was told that an emotional undercurrent of the episode concerned his failed relationship with Kate. Holloway commented that Sawyer <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> I have [...] "my beer... but I don't have my girl. He's worried, and drowning it with beer".|$|E
