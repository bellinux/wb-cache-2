5|$|The Ormulum or Orrmulum is a twelfth-century work {{of biblical}} exegesis, {{written by a}} monk named Orm (or Ormin) and {{consisting}} of just under 19,000 lines of early Middle English verse. Because of the unique phonetic orthography adopted by its author, the work preserves many details of <b>English</b> <b>pronunciation</b> existing {{at a time when}} the language was in flux after the Norman conquest of England. Consequently, it is invaluable to philologists and historical linguists in tracing the development of the language.|$|E

50|$|The {{pronunciation}} of {{the code}} words varies according to the language habits of the speaker. To eliminate wide variations in pronunciation, recordings and posters illustrating the pronunciation desired by the ICAO are available. However, there are still differences in pronunciation between the ICAO and other agencies, and the ICAO has conflicting Roman-alphabet and IPA transcriptions. Also, although all codes for {{the letters of the}} alphabet are English words, they are not in general given <b>English</b> <b>pronunciations.</b> Assuming that the transcriptions are not intended to be precise, only 11 of the 26—Bravo, Echo, Hotel, Juliet(t), Kilo, Mike, Papa, Quebec, Romeo, Whiskey, and Zulu—are given <b>English</b> <b>pronunciations</b> by all these agencies, though not always the same <b>English</b> <b>pronunciations.</b>|$|R
25|$|Inconsistencies and {{irregularities}} in <b>English</b> <b>pronunciation</b> and spelling have gradually increased in number {{throughout the history}} of the English language. There are a number of contributing factors. First, gradual changes in pronunciation, such as the Great Vowel Shift, account for a tremendous number of irregularities. Second, relatively recent loan words from other languages generally carry their original spellings, which are often not phonetic in English. The Romanization of languages (e.g., Chinese) using alphabets derived from the Latin alphabet has further complicated this problem, for example when pronouncing Chinese proper names (of people or places).|$|E
25|$|Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (<b>English</b> <b>pronunciation</b> , Latin for Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), often {{referred}} to as simply the Principia, is a work in three books by Isaac Newton, in Latin, first published 5 July 1687. After annotating and correcting his personal copy of the first edition, Newton published two further editions, in 1713 and 1726. The Principia states Newton's laws of motion, forming the foundation of classical mechanics; Newton's law of universal gravitation; and a derivation of Kepler's laws of planetary motion (which Kepler first obtained empirically). The Principia {{is considered one of the}} most important works in the history of science.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} with the song's tempo, Azalea's rapping is fast-paced and in Southern American <b>English</b> <b>pronunciation</b> throughout. A timed build-drop production formula is used to vary her delivery in which she puts emphasis on certain lyrics and lifts off on others. During the verses, Azalea's delivery is expletively riddled and contains trill consonants, particularly during the bridge, [...] "All about money, the nice never ending / We party till morning, tomorrow we kick it". According to Digital Spy's Lewis Corner, the chorus causes the listener to [...] "adhere to the song's title". In it, Azalea repeatedly raps, [...] "Make it bounce / Make it bounce / Make it bounce / Shake it, break it, make it bounce". Lyrically, [...] "Bounce" [...] is about being carefree, partying, dancing, and celebrating life. Sam Lansky of Idolator describes the lyrics as [...] "party-happy uncomplicated fun". Several critics compared the song to 2 Unlimited's [...] "No Limit" [...] (1993).|$|E

500|$|That year, Queen {{released}} a platinum {{edition of the}} album which included new songs, such as [...] "Papi Te Quiero" [...] and [...] "Tu No Puedes", and began recording her next album. Queen's fourth studio album was planned to be her debut full-length English-language album after she received record-contract offers {{from a number of}} labels, including Sony. She said it was a good opportunity to reach the competitive Anglo hip hop music market after her success in Latin American countries. Queen received an offer to record an English-language album after Sony notified her that her Sony albums from six years earlier were being played in cities such as London because of Divas success. Despite her concerns about her <b>English</b> <b>pronunciation,</b> she continued with the project. Queen recorded songs with some of hip hop's most popular MCs, including American rapper Fat Joe (who appeared on her debut English album).

500|$|... "Work" [...] is a {{snap and}} trap song which {{incorporates}} elements of EDM. Nina Long of Respect. {{describes it as}} the [...] "polar opposite" [...] of Azalea's previous material. The track opens with Azalea challenging [...] "Walk a mile in these Louboutins", upon a sweeping keyboard introduction and balladic beat. It then leads into a similarly sad, string-laden first verse segment containing plaintive melodies. According to Gregory Adams of Exclaim!, the song [...] "starts off smooth and ballady, with Azalea running through lines about her background, but soon drops into club-minded claps and screeching synths". A prominent synth, bass and drum-heavy production drop formula then occurs at the song's refrain, in which Azalea repeats the hook, [...] "I been work work work work, workin' on my shit". The production drop casts Azalea's rapping against {{a combination of a}} Roland TR-808-heavy, minimal trap beat and EDM clapping effects. Using divisive Southern American <b>English</b> <b>pronunciation,</b> Azalea employs a defiant and rattling, staccato delivery in double-time. Her rapping pace varies from fast, intricate rhymes to slow, stretched-out singular words. While in the verses, her delivery is expletively riddled.|$|E

Queen signed a deal to record an English-language album after Sony contacted her and notified her that her albums from when she was with the label six years prior are now being heard in cities like London. This was because of the success of Diva. Despite her concerns over her poor <b>English</b> <b>pronunciation,</b> she continued with the project.
