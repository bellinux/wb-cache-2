Moreover, adaption of the proposed method under different color noise will also be studied for multicomponent non-stationary signals in more applications.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we define {{a notion of}} uniform {{distribution}} and discrepancy of sequences in an abstract set E through reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of functions on E. In {{the case of the}} finite-dimensional unit cube these discrepancies are very closely related to the worst case error obtained for numerical integration of functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. In the compact case we show that the discrepancy tends to zero if and only if the sequence is uniformly distributed <b>in</b> <b>our</b> sense. <b>Next</b> we prove an existence theorem for such uniformly distributed sequences and investigate the relation to the classical notion of uniform distribution. Some examples conclude this paper...|$|R

The functional forms of polarized densities {{are based on the}} fit to unpolarized deep inelastic data made by the MRST group (MRST 99). We have concentrated on different models for gluon spin distributions. In the best fit we get for gluon polarization (at Gev^{ 2 }) Delta G=- 1. 0 +/- 0. 6.

60|$|Mathematical logic, even in {{its most}} modern form, is not {{directly}} of philosophical importance except in its beginnings. After the beginnings, it belongs rather to mathematics than to philosophy. Of its beginnings, which are {{the only part of}} it that can properly be called philosophical logic, I shall speak shortly. But even the later developments, though not directly philosophical, will be found of great indirect use in philosophising. They enable us to deal easily with more abstract conceptions than merely verbal reasoning can enumerate; they suggest fruitful hypotheses which otherwise could hardly be thought of; and they enable us to see quickly what is the smallest store of materials with which a given logical or scientific edifice can be constructed. Not only Frege's theory of number, which we shall deal with in Lecture VII., but the whole theory of physical concepts which will be outlined <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> two lectures, is inspired by mathematical logic, and could never have been imagined without it.|$|E

It appears, then, from a {{consideration}} of these several points, that, in our antiquated style of villa architecture, some national feeling may be discovered; but in any buildings now raised there is no character whatever: all is ridiculous imitation, and despicable affectation; and it is much to be lamented, that now, when {{a great deal of}} public attention has been directed to architecture {{on the part of the}} public, more efforts are not made to turn that attention from mimicking Swiss châlets, to erecting English houses. We need not devote more time to the investigation of purely domestic English architecture, though we hope to derive much instruction and pleasure from the contemplation of buildings partly adapted for defense, and partly for residence. The introduction of the means of defense is, however, a distinction which we do not wish at present to pass over; and therefore, <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>next</b> paper, we hope to conclude the subject of the villa, by a few remarks on the style now best adapted for English scenery.|$|E
