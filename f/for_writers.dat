5|$|During the First World War, Paris {{sometimes}} {{found itself}} on the front line; 600 to 1,000 Paris taxis played a small but highly important symbolic role in transporting 6,000 soldiers to the front line at the First Battle of the Marne. The city was also bombed by Zeppelins and shelled by German long-range guns. In the years after the war, known as Les Années Folles, Paris {{continued to be a}} mecca <b>for</b> <b>writers,</b> musicians and artists from around the world, including Ernest Hemingway, Igor Stravinsky, James Joyce, Josephine Baker, Sidney Bechet and the surrealist Salvador Dalí.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} it aired, the episode was watched in 8,520,000 homes {{and had a}} 3.9 Nielsen rating, {{finishing}} fourth in its timeslot. The episode did finish first in the 18-34 demographic with a 4.7 Nielsen rating and a 13% share of the audience, narrowly beating an episode of 60 Minutes featuring Barack Obama in the demographic. Tim Long was nominated <b>for</b> <b>Writers</b> Guild of America Award in the animation category for writing the episode.|$|E
5|$|One {{plot device}} {{used in the}} pilot, Henry's pocket watch, proved to be {{difficult}} to use in subsequent episodes. In the beginning, the writers would have Henry's pocket watch fall out of his pocket so that it would not disappear {{with the rest of his}} body. It became more difficult <b>for</b> <b>writers</b> to develop believable scenarios in which Henry would lose his watch, so they did not write it into the plot as frequently in later episodes.|$|E
5|$|The Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer is the Hugo Award given {{each year}} <b>for</b> <b>writers</b> of works related to science fiction or fantasy which {{appeared}} in low- or non-paying publications such as semiprozines or fanzines or in generally available electronic media during the previous calendar year.

The award was first presented in 1967 and has been awarded annually.|$|E

30|$|Even if {{the first}} writer {{recognition}} systems have been evaluated mainly with Latin languages, different systems have emerged later and focused to other scripts.

5|$|The {{arrival of}} sound film {{created a new}} job market <b>for</b> <b>writers</b> of screen dialogue. Many {{newspaper}} journalists moved to California and became studio-employed screenwriters. This resulted {{in a series of}} fast-talking comedy pictures featuring newsmen. The Front Page, later re-made as the much less cynical and more sentimental post-Code His Girl Friday (1940), was adapted from the Broadway play by Chicago newsmen, and Hollywood screenwriters, Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur. It was based on Hecht's experiences working as a reporter for the Chicago Daily Journal.|$|E
5|$|The {{accusations against}} Clarence, Stephen, Gull and Druitt also draw on {{cultural}} {{perceptions of a}} decadent ruling class, and depict a high-born murderer or murderers preying on lower-class victims. Because Druitt and the other upper-middle-class and aristocratic Ripper suspects were wealthy, there is more biographical material on them than on {{the residents of the}} Whitechapel slums. Consequently, it is easier <b>for</b> <b>writers</b> to construct solutions based on a wealthy culprit rather than one involving a Whitechapel resident. There is no direct evidence against Druitt, and since the 1970s, the number of Jack the Ripper suspects has continued to grow, with the result that there are now over 100 different theories about the Ripper's identity.|$|E
5|$|The first {{appearance}} of the mounted police in fiction occurred in Joseph Collin's The Story of Louis Riel, published in 1885. The police soon became a popular subject <b>for</b> <b>writers,</b> with over 150 novels about the force and its successor, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, being published between 1890 and 1940 across North America and Britain, along with magazine articles and publications for children. Gilbert Parker, James Curwood and Ralph Connor's works proved particularly popular and influential. Connor's Corporal Cameron, published in 1912, {{set the tone for}} many later books with a tale of its initially dissolute protagonist's redemption through service with the police. Numerous poems were written about the force, with the best known probably being the Riders of the Plains, which was first published in 1878 and later expanded upon several times.|$|E
