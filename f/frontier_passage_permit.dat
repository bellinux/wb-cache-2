Initial contact between the ambassador (High Commissioner) of Pakistan in London and representatives of Israel and Jewish organizations was made in early 1950. The Pakistani government was asked to issue <b>passage</b> <b>permits</b> to India for a few hundred Jews who wanted to leave Afghanistan and wished to emigrate to Israel.

Slowly the door receded on its hinges--I was ready to spring forward to seize and grapple with the intruder, till the sight of who it was changed at once the temper of my mind. It was Juliet herself; pale and trembling she stood, a lamp in her hand, on the threshold of the dungeon, looking at me with wistful countenance. But in a moment she re-assumed her self-possession; and her languid eyes recovered their brilliancy. She said, [...] "I am come to save you, Verney." ...|$|R

40|$|DE 102008009121 A 1 UPAB: 20090826 NOVELTY - The {{arrangement}} (1) has {{a control}} and evaluating unit and two distance measuring devices (3, 4) whose scanning beams stretch a two-dimensional scanning plane in an area, and a kinetic sensor system for detecting position {{and direction of}} measuring devices. Two scanning planes (14, 15) are arranged vertically and normal vectors are arranged non-parallel to a progressive movement vector of a carrier vehicle (2). Each scanning plane has a common cutting line {{in such a manner}} that parts of measuring objects (5) are detectable from the scanning beams of different distance measuring devices. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for producing surface data from data records. USE - Distance measuring arrangement for detecting a measuring object i. e. building such as house, and an object provided at a driveway of a carrier vehicle. ADVANTAGE - The scanning plane has common cutting line such that parts of measuring objects are detectable from the scanning beams of different distance measuring devices, thus safely detecting static environment in only one <b>passage,</b> <b>permitting</b> safe allocation of the measuring data to structural components and producing less data volume...|$|R
