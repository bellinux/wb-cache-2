If reaction overstepping is high, the path of fluid-rock system on T-XCO 2 diagram intersects the wollastonite-producing reaction. If overstepping is low, the path of fluid-rock system never intersects the wollastonite-producing reaction. The amount of overstepping is influenced by the amount of fluid flow. Presence of pore-lining cements in preserved fossils in the inner grossularite- and wollastonite zones implies a pathway for enhanced fluid flow was present in the inner contact aureole during metamorphism. ^ Reaction overstepping in combination with non-dilational process during dike emplacement may explain the development of irregular contact aureoles. This implies that the typical assumptions used to evaluate contact aureoles may not be valid for contact aureoles associated with small dikes. ...|$|E

Coordinates for the geological map were estimated from the Descanso and Morena Reservoir 7. 5 -minute QuadranglesThe Morena Reservoir roof pendant is located on the western slope of the Laguna Mountains about 60 km east of San Diego. It is surrounded by the typical plutonic rocks of the Peninsular Ranges batholith. The metasediments consist of calc-silicate bearing quartzites and conglomerates, and pelitic schists and quartzites. The calc-silicate bearing rocks are non-foliated whereas the pelitic rocks are moderately to strongly foliated. Assemblages in the calc-silicate bearing rocks include quartz, plagioclase (An 50 to An 70), diopside, actinolitic amphibole, clinozoisite, <b>grossularite,</b> calcite, wollastonite, apatite, sphene, and graphite. Assemblages in the pelitic rocks include quartz, plagioclase (An 28 to An 40), potassium feldspar, cordierite, biotite, muscovite, sillimanite, andalusite, and graphite. The major structure of the pendant is a northwest plunging, antiformal fold. Erosion below the hinge has exposed complex folding in the axial region. A series of northwest trending faults cut both the pendant and the surrounding plutonics. Mineral parageneses in the metasediments indicate low-pressure, moderate-temperature conditions of metamorphism, approximately 2 kb and 600 to 650 degrees C. These conditions are best illustrated in the pelitic parageneses. These metamorphic conditions and the parageneses present are similar to many found in the Buchan rocks of Scotland and in the Abukuma Plateau of Japan.

40|$|The {{structural}} geology and metamorphic petrology of the Bosost {{area in the}} Valle de Arán (Central Pyrenees) is discussed. The rocks {{exposed in}} this area consist of Cambro-Ordovician mica-schists with numerous granite and pegmatite bodies, phyllites and limestones; Silurian slates and schists and Devonian schists and limestones. The major structure dating from the Hercynian orogeny is the Garonne dome with essentially horizontal schistosity. Large steep folds in the Devonian accompanied by axial plane slaty cleavage are folded disharmonically {{with regard to the}} Cambro-Ordovician. Both kinds of structures date from the main phase. A second and later phase with N-S foldaxes was accompanied by laminar flow in E-W direction as shown by numerous rotated porphyroblasts. A third and fourth phase of deformation have folds with vertical axial planes in NW-SE and E-W direction. These last three phases are characterized by minor and microfolds only. The method of investigating microstructures mainly with regard to porphyroblasts is discussed first; then its application. This resulted in the establishment of four metamorphic zones: a biotite-zone; a staurolite-andalusite-cordierite-zone; an andalusite-cordierite-zone and a cordierite-sillimanite-zone; in this order with increasing grade. The higher zones have passed through each of the lower grade ones, so that the cordierite-sillimanite-zone has the most complex history. Staurolite is the first aluminium-silicate to crystallize with increasing temperature, than andalusite, cordierite and finally sillimanite. Before sillimanite started to form, staurolite was already unstable; at the beginning of sillimanite crystallization andalusite became unstable. Cale-silicate rocks in the Ordovician limestone in the cordierite-sillimanite-zone contain bytownite, <b>grossularite,</b> diopside and vesuvianite. Granite and pegmatite bodies and sills occur in all the aluminium-silicate bearing zones, but most abundant in the cordierite-sillimanite-zone. Their emplacement lasted from shortly after the first phase until after the fourth. The culminating point lies around the fourth phase. The granites are mainly composed of albite, quartz, and muscovite; the pegmatites carry smaller or larger amounts of microcline. Chemical analyses of phyllites and mica-schists have shown that the composition of both rock groups is essentially the same. With increasing silicium content, aluminium and potassium decrease. The granites have high alcali percentages with sodium predominating over potassium...|$|E
40|$|In the {{introduction}} the criteria are mentioned which {{enable us to}} distinguish {{the products of the}} synkinematic and post-kinematic phases of the Hercynian metamorphism. A short characteristic has been given of the Silurian and Cambro-Ordovician rocks. The mica-schists, discussed in Chapter I, are exposed in the southeastern, central and northern parts of the mapped area. The grade of metamorphism increases from north to south in this rock-series. A biotite-, an andalusiteand a sillimanite zone can be distinguished. The biotite- and andalusite zones originated during the synkinematic phase. However, the sillimanite of the mica-schists is thought to be post-kinematic. There are indications that the rocks of the sillimanite zone have undergone high-grade metamorphism. In the low-grade biotite-muscovite-schists a marble layer occurs with biotite-gneiss bands, containing fairly basic plagioclase. Three varieties of synkinematic gneiss are distinguished: A) Sillimanitegneisses (migmatites), B) quartz-dioritic gneisses and C) homogeneous biotite-gneisses. The migmatites predominate in a 200 m thick zone which is located structurally below the mica-schists. The migmatization (both lit-par-lit replacement and metamorphic differentiation probably were involved) appears to be late- to post-kinematic. Nearly all the sillimanite, however, is postkinematic. The quartz-dioritic gneisses are supposed to have been formed by a selective sodium metasomatism of lime-bearing pelites. The biotite-gneisses possibly originated from semipelitic or pelitic rocks by sodium metasomatism. The quartz-diorites which occur structurally below the zone of migmatites, mentioned above, occupy most of the area in the north-eastern and southeastern parts of the region investigated. In most cases it was clear that these rocks were formed by rheomorphism at the expense of migmatites. On the other hand, static recrystallization of homogeneous biotite-gneisses may also result in the formation of quartz-diorites. The field observations show that rheomorphism took place on a regional scale in the Trois Seigneurs massif. Nowhere do the quartz-diorites break through the sillimanite-gneiss zone, which forms a continuous envelope around these rocks. Numerous relics of the pre-existing rock series are still recognizable in the autochthonous quartzdiorites. The resisters (Chapter IV) occur as conformable layers or lenses in the synkinematic gneisses. These lenses and layers have been broken into many pieces, due to the flow movements in the rheomorphic quartz-diorites. A series of rock types of sedimentary origin (part I) could be distinguished: magnesian and non-magnesian marbles and lime-silicate rocks, hornblende and biotite-bytownite-gneisses (presumably original marls) and quartzites. They may be intercalated, and usually show a typical sedimentary banding. Transitions between the three different types have been observed. Another group of resisters (part II) show characteristics which indicate that they are of igneous origin. The quartz-gabbros (part III) probably originated at the expense of amphibolites through an extreme static recrystallization. In the registers a synkinematic paragenesis can be distinguished which can be placed in the amphibolite facies. The following minerals: diopside, clinopyroxene, <b>grossularite,</b> wollastonite, forsterite, spinel, calcic plagioclase and green hornblende characterize this paragenesis. Furthermore a high-grade post-kinematic association is present which contains, among others: cummingtonite, light green amphibole, pargasite, cordierite (?), anthophyllite (?), and bytownite. During the post-kinematic phase the green hornblende of the hornblende-bytownite-gneisses apparently remained stable as did the clinopyroxene, <b>grossularite</b> and basic plagioclase of the lime-silicate rocks. In association with late cross-cutting pegmatites a low-grade paragenesis occurs: sericite, pennine, epidote, clinozoisite, prehnite, actinolite and albite. It was not possible to establish, whether the tremolite, epidote and clinozoisite of the lime-silicate rocks originated in association with pegmatites, or {{as a result of the}} cooling in the rock series during the latest stages of the metamorphism. In general the resisters probably underwent an isochemical metamorphism. Sills or cross-cutting dykes of pegmatite and leucocratic granitic rocks (Chapter V) are of frequent occurrence in the gneisses of the Trois Seigneurs massif. They originated during many different stages of the Hercynian metamorphism. In the quartz-diorites the early sills reacted as plastic bodies during the stage of rheomorphism and preserved their original parallel position. The muscovite-granite of the Pic d’Estibat is located close above the migmatite boundary. The biotite-muscovite granite of la Ruse (Chapter VI) is possibly intrusive and perhaps originated at the expense of a concentration of pegmatites and leucocratic granites which, as a rule, occur near the migmatite boundary. The biotite-granodiorite of the Pic des Trois Seigneurs is described in Chapter VII. Its intrusive character is clear, mainly from evidence of shouldering aside the enclosing rocks. It is suggested that the original magma of the granodiorite originated at the expense of autochthonous gneisses and quartzdiorites which have become intrusive. There are indications that the granodiorite body narrows downward and that the connection with the autochthonous rocks has more or less been lost. Bodies of chlorite-albite rock (Chapter VIII) occur in many places in the gneisses and quartz-diorites of the mapped area, but also in the biotite-granodiorite of the Pic des Trois Seigneurs, and even in the micaschists. It could be proved that these rocks were formed through a strong sodium metasomatism under hydrothermal conditions. Especially in the field, the original appearance of the pre-existing rocks has been well preserved. Small lenses of chloritite frequently occur in the chlorite-albite rocks. They are original basic resisters. These rocks appear to be later than the late-Hercynian cross-cutting pegmatites. The age of the chlorite-albite rocks could not yet be determined. Possibly they are associated with the late-Hercynian period of faulting or with the Alpine orogeny. The influence of chloritization and albitization is also clear in gneisses and quartz-diorites near important fault zones. The structural relations of the Trois Seigneurs massif with respect to the surrounding mesozoic rocks and the axial zone of the Pyrenees are discussed in the last chapter...|$|E

Show negative values of é́psilonŃd (- 8. 35 to - 11. 31) and age model (TDM) of 1, 842 the 1114 Ma. Garnet peridotite with textures 1 and 2 (GPT 1 and GPT 2) exhibit severe deformation textures, with formation of neoblastos of olivine. GPT 1 shows more enriched in olivine porfiroclasto and lower contents of garnet, with higher CaO content in the CPX, while the GRT GPT 2 is more enriched in TiO 2. GT 1 and GT 2 have the smallest contents of incompatible elements (ETRL 10 times the chondrite) of peridotite. The equilibrium temperatures and pressures were between 1084 and 1473 ºC, and 37 to 58 kbars for GPT 1, respectively, and 1263 to 1408 °C and 40 to 60 Kbars for GPT 2. Show negative values of é́psilonŃd (- 3. 24) and age model (TDM) of 1, 242 Ma. The high content of incompatible elements, with enrichment of light in CPX and ETRs impoverishment in GRT, suggests that the xenoliths represent a enriched mantle source type, with negative é́psilonŃd and Sm/Nd < 1. It could be inferred that these were formed by igneous fractionation peridotite in the upper mantle, then lithosphere for GEPS and GEPE and asthenosphere for GPT 1 and GPT 2, being basaltic liquid extraction residue (e. g. Group volcanic Roosevelt). Metasomatized peridotite (MARID) represent the crystallization of metasomatic minerals (Modal) and anomalous enrichment of trace elements and ETRs, {{and it could be}} associated with a concomitant with the event source carbonatitic-kimberlitic. Xenoliths of eclogite are rare and they can be divided into three groups: i) bi-minerálicos Eclogite (EB), ii) Orthopyroxene-rutile eclogite (ORE); and iii) Sanidinequartz-coesite eclogite (SQC). The modal content of garnet increases of the ORE for EB to SQC. In this same sense is an increase of <b>grossularite</b> molecule in garnet and Al 2 O 3 in clinopyroxene. EB and ORE present chemical composition of group. A or Group I eclogite. SQC have composition similar to group B or II. Exhibit isotopic variables from positive reasons é́psilonŃd + 0. 16 (ORE) until negative values high é́psilonŃd - 13. 03 (EB), and age model (TDM) between 1166 to 1648 Ma. The internal isochrone CPX and GRT, and two whole rock eclogites (EB and ORE) presented a crystallization age and/or recrystallization of 200 Ma, corroborating the hypothesis that the eclogite were formed by the subduction of oceanic crust (Proto) {{at the bottom of the}} supercontinent of Gondwana during the Mesozoic. However, do not rule out the hypothesis that the eclogite (EB and ORE) could be considered cumulus of high-pressure igneous and/or melting basaltic liquid residue during mesoproterozoics events. The megacristais suite (LICPX) features low Cr content, with affinity to eclogite. Can be interpreted as formed during the co-precipitation of low chromium clinopyroxene and picroilmenite, below temperatures between 1264 ° C and 1308 ° C in a liquid proto-kimberlitic...|$|E
40|$|Models {{of upper}} mantle and crustal {{processes}} relating to metamorphism can be proposed if {{the distribution of}} temperature and pressure during a metamorphic event is known. Knowledge {{of the distribution of}} temperature and pressure during the Dalradian metamorphism in the west and south west Scottish Highlands has not materially increased since Elles and Tilley (1930) applied Barrow's (1912) zones to this area. This study was initiated to improve this situation. Rocks from an area 3 miles by 2 miles, east and south east of Spean Bridge, 15 miles east of Tort William, Inverness-shire, were studied to find the conditions of metamorphism, temperature and pressure and the composition and behaviour of the fluid phase attending metamorphism. The rocks are siliceous dolomites, carbonate-bearing pelites (calc-pelites), Ca-rich, but carbonate-free pelites, graphitic pelites and graphitic calc-pelites of the Leven Schists metamorphosed in the garnet zone of the epidote amphibolite facies. Characteristic assemblages are : pelites: quartz-oligoclase-biotite-chlorite-muscovite-garnet-epidote-ilmenite siliceous dolomites: quartz-oligoclase-phlogopite-chlorite-talc-tremolite-calcite-dolomite-rutile calc-pelites: quartz-oligoclase-biotite-chlorite or muscovite-epidote-calcite-calcite-dolomite-sphene and/or rutile The rocks show a considerable variety of assemblages which appear to be in textural equilibrium. The preponderance of low variance assemblages and the occurrence of apparently incompatible assemblages, even on a thin section scale, suggest that the fluid phase composition was buffered by the assemblage. The relationship of fluid pressure to solid pressure and the composition of the fluid phase are discussed and it is concluded that P fluid = P total and P CO 2 + P H 2 O = P fluid are good approximations except in the graphitic rocks where methane was {{an important component of the}} fluid phase. The metamorphic variables that control the assemblages are considered to be temperature, pressure and X CO 2 (and X CH 4 in the graphitic rocks). The descriptions and calculations on the assemblages are considered in terms of a model system, K 2 O-CaO-MgO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -CO 2 -H 2 0, with the phases quartz, anorthite, calcite, dolomite, talc, tremolite, clinochlore, muscovite, phlogopite, clinozoisite and <b>grossularite</b> which are components of minerals found in the assemblages. A thermodynamic background for the calculation of metamorphic conditions is presented. The calculations are only as reliable as the thermodynamic data. The errors on the best calorimetric determinations of enthalpies of minerals become unacceptably large when applied to the enthalpy change of a reaction because the enthalpy of reaction is often an order of magnitude smaller than the enthalpy of individual minerals. The corollary is that precise relative thermodynamic data can be calculated from experimentally reversed reactions. A calculation method is presented and is used to derive themodynamic data for the model system phases and, in addition, forsterite, enstatite, sphene, wollastonite, annite, Fe-chlorite, almandine, Fe-staurolite, Fe-chloritoid and Mg-cordierite. These data and the activities of the model system components in microprobe analysed minerals are used to infer the metamorphic conditions. The % MgCO 3 in calcite in equilibrium with dolomite provides a geothermometer with the experimental calibration of the calcite-dolomite solvus in MgCO 3 -CaCO 4 by Goldsmith and Newton (1969). The natural carbonates contain iron, but Fe is shown to have little or no affect on the solvus. About 20 calcites from each of seven calcite-dolomite bearing rocks were probe analysed to apply the calcite-dolomite geothermometer. There is evidence from the area of two metamorphic events, a main event affecting the whole area and a late event affecting only the siliceous dolomites. The calcites from the rocks, apart from the siliceous dolomites show a narrow range of composition, representing a temperature of 546 Â°C at 2 kbars or 530 Â°C at 6 kbars. There is no indication of a temperature gradient across the area. The analysed assemblages are all univariant in the model system; one variable, tempeature, is fixed. so that the others can be calculated. A graphitic assemblage quartz-oligoclase-biotite-chlorite-clinozoisite-tremolite-calcite-dolomite-graphite is univariant if the fluid phase contained methane. Applying the calcite temperature, this assemblage formed at about 5. 6 kbars with X CH 4 = 0. 30 and X CO 2 = 0. 40. Two calc-pelitic assemblages quartz-oligoclase-biotite-chlorite-epidote-calcite-dolomite quartz-oligoclase-biotite-muscovite-epidote-calcite-dolomite give pressures of 4. 8 and 5. 0 kbars and X CO 2 = 0. 55 and 0. 60 respectively. The fine grained parts of the siliceous dolomites appear not to have been affected by the late event. Two different assemblages quartz-oligoclase-tremolite-talc-dolomite-clinochlore quartz-oligoclase-tremolite-calcite-dolomite-clinochlore give pressures of 4. 5 and 4. 7 kbars and X CO 2 of 0. 3 and 0. 8 respectively. The carbonate-free pelitic assemblages are compositionally far removed from the model system. Although they are model invariant (if X CO 2 = 0), reactions that intersect to form the invariant point do not converge in the pressure range of metamorphism. This is interpreted as being due to the failure of the method for calculating activities at this degree of dilution. The conditions of metamorphism for the main metamorphic event from 1, 2 and 3 above are concluded to be about 5 kbars at 535 Â°C with variable fluid phase composition. The siliceous dolomites have been recrystallised along irregular surfaces on which large tremolites are developed. The assemblage in the coarse grained part of the siliceous dolomites is model invariant, quartz-albite-phlogopite-talc-chlorite-tremolite-calcite-dolomite This represents metamorphic conditions of about 420 Â°C and 1 kbar. The calcites from the siliceous dolomites have a wide spread in %MgCO 3. This is interpreted as re equilibration at a lower temperature than the main event, probably between 400 Â°C and 450 Â°C. Fluid inclusion studies (by Mr F. W. Smith, Durham University) on a semi-conformable quartz vein from within the area defines a pressure temperature band for the formation of the quartz vein. This intersects the band of calcite temperatures and corresponds with the calculated conditions for the siliceous dolomite assemblage. The late metamorphic event, at about 420 Â°C and 1 kbar, is interpreted as a late flushing through of the area by magmatic or metamorphic iLuids along fractures through the pelites and into the more permeable rocks along minor planes of weakness to form the coarse assemblage of the siliceous dolomites and partly re-equilibrate the calcites. The distribution of sphene and rutile in calcite-quartz bearing assemblages cannot be interpreted as equilibrium if the above calculations are crrrect. For sphene to have been stable, the X CO 2 must have been less than 0. 03. It is considered that sphene is metastable in many of the calcite-quartz bearing assemblages, casting some doubt upon the conclusions of Ernst (1971) on the fluid phase composition during the Franciscan and Sanbagawa metamorphism. </p...|$|E
