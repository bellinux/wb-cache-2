5|$|In the 1890s {{some people}} – {{including}} the young Calogero Vizzini – <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about {{the absence of}} peace and security in the countryside. The state police {{at the time was}} as much a danger as the brigands. The Villalba Mafia thus emerged as an alternative social regime centred on the membership in church-sponsored associations that generated considerable social capital. It later transformed into a protection racket, victimizing villagers and landowners alike through violence, intimidation and omertà.|$|E

Czolgosz, since hearing a speech by anarchist Emma Goldman in Cleveland, had <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> he believed would advance the cause. After his failure to get close enough on the fifth, Czolgosz waited the next day at the Temple of Music on the Exposition grounds, where the President was to meet the public. Czolgosz concealed his gun in a handkerchief, and, when he reached the head of the line, shot McKinley twice in the abdomen.|$|E

In order to {{distract}} him from the Ruspanti, Violante Beatrice threw banquets, to which she invited the foremost members of Tuscan society. The Grand Duke's behaviour, vomiting, belching and cracking rude jokes, literally sent the guests scrambling to leave. The Electress was more fortunate for her part. She succeeded in making Gian Gastone appear on Saint John the Baptist's day, 1729.

25|$|In 1846 {{the potato}} crop failed {{and there was}} a bad harvest, {{resulting}} in the price of bread going up steeply and causing 'a great distress among the poor', especially in Ireland where famine followed. But while affluent Torquinians collected over £4,000 for the relief of the Irish, many Devonians were less than happy about their own situation and <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about it. Rumours of disturbances had spread around the town but no heed had been taken, so when at 7.30 p.m. on 17 May a crowd assembled in Lower Union Street the authorities were caught off guard as attacks were made on bakers' shops and women carried off the spoils in their aprons.

25|$|The film {{is based}} on the story of the origin of the Book of Kells, an {{illuminated}} manuscript Gospel book in Latin, containing the four Gospels of the New Testament located in Dublin, Ireland. It also draws upon Celtic mythology, examples include its inclusion of Crom Cruach, a pre-Christian Irish deity and the reference to the poetic genre of Aislings, in which a poet is confronted by a dream or vision of a seeress, in the naming of the forest sprite encountered by Brendan. Wider mythological similarities have also been commented upon, such as parallels between Brendan's metaphysical battle with Crom Cruach and Beowulf's underwater encounter with Grendel's mother. The Secret of Kells began development in 1999, when Tomm Moore and several of his friends were inspired by Richard Williams's The Thief and the Cobbler, Disney's Mulan and the works of Hayao Miyazaki, which based their visual style on the respective traditional art of the cultures featured in each film. They <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> similar to Studio Ghibli's films but with Irish art. Tomm Moore explained that the visual style was inspired by Celtic and medieval art, being 'flat, with false perspective and lots of colour'. Even the clean up was planned to, 'obtain the stained glass effect of thicker outer lines'.|$|E

500|$|Nixon's {{defeat of}} Voorhis {{has been cited}} as {{the first of a}} number of red-baiting campaigns by the future {{president}} which elevated him to the House, the Senate, the Vice Presidency, and eventually put him in position to run for president. [...] Nixon, in his 1978 memoir, stated that the central issue in the 1946 campaign was [...] "the quality of life in postwar America", and he won because voters [...] "had 'had enough,' and they <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about it". [...] Voorhis, in his 1947 memoir, indicated that the [...] "most important single factor in the campaign of 1946 was the difference in general attitude between the 'outs' and the 'ins'. [...] Anyone seeking to unseat an incumbent needed only to point out all the things that had gone wrong and all the trouble of the war period and its aftermath." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} [...] "Mother Simpson" [...] was pitched by Richard Appel, who <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about Homer's mother, who {{previously}} {{had only been}} mentioned once. Many of the writers {{could not believe that}} an episode about Homer's mother had not previously been produced. Part of the fun of an episode about Homer's mother for the writers was {{that they were able to}} solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from. The ending shot with Homer gazing at the sky was decided at the table read, but the drawing at the end was inserted by David Silverman because it was felt that the scene was so touching that no other lines were needed. As a result, no promos were aired over the credits during the original airing of the episode. Bill Oakley has admitted that he always gets teary-eyed when he watches the ending.|$|E

[...] Satin published 75 issues of New Options from 1984 to 1992, virtually half a million words. [...] He wrote nearly all the articles. [...] In 1989 New Options received Utne Readers first [...] "Alternative Press Award for General Excellence: Best Publication from 10,000 to 30,000 Circulation".

He told Mitch Albom that when he made it to the NBA, he realized how much leisure time the multimillionaire players had and <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> productive instead of find ways to spend his new riches. [...] "I knew if I kept pushing it off, I'd never get it done", he said. He completed his final 32 course hours by taking summer classes in 1994 during the NBA off-season. He took correspondence classes and independent study courses during the following season, studying on road trips and mailing in his papers from the nearest post office. In the end, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in radio-television communication (with a minor in business) at Michigan. He told Albom that earning his degree made him a better example when speaking about staying in school. [...] Although Howard had spent the prior year playing in the NBA, he returned to campus to partake in graduation ceremonies with his classmates. [...] During the graduation, keynote speaker Marian Wright Edelman paid special recognition to Howard and Fab Five teammates King and Jackson, who graduated together, and noted that Howard's graduation made him a role model for children.|$|E
500|$|Apple filed {{a patent}} {{infringement}} suit against High Tech Computer Corp. (HTC) in March 2010 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware {{in the two}} companies' ongoing battle with each other, and a complaint against HTC under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) in Washington, D.C. Apple's suit alleged 20 separate patent infringements relating to the iPhone's user interface, underlying architecture and hardware. Steve Jobs exclaimed [...] "We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions, or {{we can do something}} about it. We've <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about it ... think competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steal ours". The ITC rejected all but one of Apple's claims, however, ruling for Apple on a single claim relating to data tapping. HTC motioned the Delaware court for a change of venue to the Northern District of California, arguing against Apple's desire to consolidate the case with the similar cases brought by Nokia against Apple, alleging insubstantial overlap between those cases and Apple's complaint, but Judge Gregory M. Sleet denied HTC's motion for a venue change, ruling that Apple's choice of forum would prevail. HTC countersued Apple in September 2011 in the same court claiming infringement of four patents HTC obtained from Google, also filing a counter-complaint with the ITC, with HTC's general counsel saying [...] "HTC will continue to protect its patented inventions against infringement from Apple until such infringement stops." [...] In May 2012 the Delaware court ordered mediation between the companies. In November 2012, HTC and Apple ended the patent dispute by settling the case, but did not disclose the terms of the settlement. The companies reported the settlement included a 10-year agreement for licensing both companies' current and future patents to each other." ...|$|E

Frankfurt devises a counterexample in which an agent is intuitively responsible even though she could not have done otherwise: Suppose someone – Black, let us say – wants Jones to perform a certain action. Black is prepared to go to considerable lengths to get his way, but he prefers to avoid showing his hand unnecessarily. So he waits until Jones is about to make up his mind what <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and he does nothing unless it is clear to him that Jones is going <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> other than what he wants him <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> If it does become clear that Jones is going <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> else, Black takes effective steps to ensure that Jones <b>decides</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and that he does do, what he wants him <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Whatever Jones's initial preferences and inclinations, then, Black will have his way … Now suppose that Black never has to show his hand because Jones, for reasons of his own, <b>decides</b> <b>to</b> perform and <b>does</b> perform the very action Black wants him to perform.
