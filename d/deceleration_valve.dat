50|$|Other {{causes of}} water hammer are pump failure and check valve slam (due to sudden <b>deceleration,</b> a check <b>valve</b> may slam shut rapidly, {{depending}} on the dynamic characteristic of the check valve and {{the mass of the}} water between a check valve and tank). To alleviate this situation, it is recommended to install non-slam check valves as they do not rely on gravity or fluid flow for their closure. For vertical pipes, other suggestions include installing new piping that can be designed to include air chambers to alleviate the possible shockwave of water due to excess water flow.|$|R
50|$|A key {{safety feature}} was a novel braking system that {{consisted}} of an automotive disc brakes attached to the vehicles driveshafts. These brakes were held off by hydraulic pressure that was present whenever the vehicle was connected with guideway power and the on-board controller was commanding them off. In the event of loss of electrical power, the hydraulic pressure holding the brakes was lost and springs inside the cylinders forced brake fluid into the calipers of the disc braking system, ensuring that the vehicles did not simply coast to a stop. In order to provide for a controlled <b>deceleration,</b> a pendulum <b>valve</b> was located {{in line with the}} brake actuation cylinders. Pendulums inside the valve reacted to the deceleration profile of the vehicle and would partially close, reducing the pressure in the brake lines and moderating the deceleration so that the emergency stop was not dangerously abrupt.|$|R
40|$|Background Nitric oxide (NO) {{has been}} shown to affect {{myocardial}} function in positive and negative inotropic ways. Expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and release of nitric oxide into the circulation has been associated with acute rejection in animal studies. The role of NO and the associated myocardial dysfunction seen during acute rejection in humans has not been adequately defined. In a prospective sequential study, we have studied the relationship between plasma nitrate and biopsy-proven acute rejection, and systolic and diastolic function after heart transplantation. Methods Biopsies were performed weekly and then fortnightly up to 12 weeks after transplantation and on clinical indication of rejection in 37 patients. Plasma nitrates were obtained on the morning of each biopsy (total 341). An echocardiogram was performed immediately prior to each biopsy in which the systolic parameters, ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (fs), and the diastolic parameters, isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT), mitral valve pressure half-time (MVPHT), mitral <b>valve</b> <b>deceleration</b> time (MVDT), e:a ratio, and a wave duration, were measured. Results Plasma-nitrate level showed no significant correlation with the systolic parameters, EF or fs, or with changes in EF or fs. No significant correlation was found between plasma-nitrate level and the diastolic parameters IVRT, MVPHT, MVDT, mitral valve a wave duration, or e:a ratio. Conclusions This study has shown no correlation between plasma nitrate and impaired systolic or diastolic function after heart transplantation. Instead there was a weak trend for elevated nitrate to be associated with better systolic function...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{is strongly}} associated with cardiovascular dysfunction, derived in part from impairment of sympathetic nervous system signaling. Glucose, insulin, and non-esterified fatty acids are potent stimulants of sympathetic activity and norepinephrine (NE) release. We hypothesized that sustained hyperglycemia in the high fat diet-fed streptozotocin (STZ) rat model of sustained hyperglycemia with insulin resistance would exhibit progressive sympathetic nervous dysfunction in parallel with deteriorating myocardial systolic and/or diastolic function. Methods Cardiac sympathetic nervous integrity was investigated in vivo via biodistribution of the positron emission tomography radiotracer and NE analogue [11 C] meta- hydroxyephedrine ([11 C]HED). Cardiac systolic and diastolic function was evaluated by echocardiography. Plasma and cardiac NE levels and NE reuptake transporter (NET) expression were evaluated as correlative measurements. Results The animal model displays insulin resistance, sustained hyperglycemia, and progressive hypoinsulinemia. After 8 weeks of persistent hyperglycemia, {{there was a significant}} 13 - 25 % reduction in [11 C]HED retention in myocardium of STZ-treated hyperglycemic but not euglycemic rats as compared to controls. There was a parallel 17 % reduction in immunoblot density for NE reuptake transporter, a 1. 2 fold and 2. 5 fold elevation of cardiac and plasma NE respectively, and no change in sympathetic nerve density. No change in ejection fraction or fractional area change was detected by echocardiography. Reduced heart rate, prolonged mitral <b>valve</b> <b>deceleration</b> time, and elevated transmitral early to atrial flow velocity ratio measured by pulse-wave Doppler in hyperglycemic rats suggest diastolic impairment of the left ventricle. Conclusions Taken together, these data suggest that sustained hyperglycemia is associated with elevated myocardial NE content and dysregulation of sympathetic nervous system signaling in the absence of systolic impairment. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} aims {{to study the}} {{relationship}} between tissue Doppler echocardiography (TDE) indices of right ventricle and exercise capacity in patients after total correction for tetralogy of Fallot (ToF). Methods: This cross-sectional observational study included 20 patients, after undergoing total correction procedure for ToF diagnosed with mild/moderate pulmonary regurgitation and 30 age-matched healthy children. In the postoperative period, patients were invited to hospital for evaluation of the ventricular functions by 2 D, M-mode, Doppler (DE) echocardiography and TDE and exercise testing to evaluate the effort capacity. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square tests, and Pearson correlation analysis. Results: Compared with the controls; the mitral annular peak systolic flow velocity (Sm) value was significantly lower, while isovolumic contraction time (IVCT), isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) and myocardial performance index (MPI) values obtained at the tricuspid and mitral (MV) valves were significantly higher (p< 0. 05 for all) in patients after ToF repair. There was a negative correlation between the exercise period and the total correction age (r=- 0. 20, p= 0. 015) and the same negative correlation existed between the exercise period and METS (r=- 0. 25, p= 0. 010). MV IVCT with DE and TDE {{was found to be}} correlated with METS (r=- 0. 45, p= 0. 04). Left ventricular MPI was found to be correlated with maximum heart rate (r=- 0. 20, p= 0. 03). By DE, tricuspid <b>valve</b> <b>deceleration</b> time and Sm peak flow velocity with TDE were significantly correlated with METS (r=- 0. 30, p= 0. 04; r=- 025, p= 0. 005, respectively). MPI calculated with TDE was correlated with maximum heart rate (r=- 0. 15, p< 0. 01). Conclusion: Even if patients, undergone total correction surgery for ToF were asymptomatic or had minimal clinical symptoms, MPI index assessed by pulse wave TDE and exercise testing may allow early diagnosis of right ventricle dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Late-diastolic mitral leaflet pre-closure {{occurs in}} {{patients}} with both natural and prosthetic mitral valves. Controversy still exists whether a fall-off of inflow-ventricular flow gradient or whether intraventricular flow patterns govern this event. Recent studies have suggested a variety of possible mechanisms responsible for diastolic mitral valve closure. One theory suggests a proportionality between the dynamics of closure of a bileaflet mitral valve with the pressure field induced by a strong flow <b>deceleration</b> through the <b>valve.</b> Another proposes {{that the impact of}} a reversed flow, generated by the roll-up of the initial vortex ring, is responsible for valve closure. To evaluate the impact of vortex rings in trans-mitral left ventricular filling flows in a physiologically shaped, in-vitro model, we studied a precisely delivered pulsed flow through an orifice with the same dimensional characteristics as the mitral annulus, and with a fully opening bileaflet mechanical valve. We used laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) for qualitative flow imaging and applied digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) for quantitating velocity, vorticity and circulation measurements. A concave “cardiac apex” shape was located seven orifice diameters downstream to simulate the flow confinement of the ventricular apex. L 1 F flow imaging for flow through the orifice depicted, first, formation of a primary vortex structure {{on each side of the}} inlet immediately downstream of the orifice. The images then revealed formation of a secondary vortex occurring during and after the impact of the initial rings on the apex. The secondary vortices rotated in the opposite direction from the initial rings and DPIV showed that they included 37 % of the initial vortex ring's circulation energy. It was clear from our study that it was these secondary structures that propagated back toward the valve. It would appear that formation of the reflected vortex rings makes a major contribution to end-diastolic mitral valve closure before the systolic pressure completes valve closure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{investigated}} the effect of prolonged cardiac arrest and subsequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function. Background. Cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation results in cessation of forward blood flow, including myocardial blood flow. During cardiopulmonary resuscitation, myocardial blood flow remains suboptimal. Once the heart is defibrillated and successful resuscitation achieved, reversible myocardial dysfunction, or “stunning,” may occur. The magnitude and time course of myocardial stunning from cardiac arrest is unknown. Methods. Twenty-eight domestic swine (26 ± 1 kg) were studied with both invasive and noninvasive measurements of ventricular function before and after 10 or 15 min of untreated cardiac arrest. Contrast left ventriculograms, ventricular pressures, cardiac output, isovolumetric relaxation time (tau) and transthoracic Doppler-echocardiographic studies were obtained. Results. Twenty-three of 28 animals were successfully resuscitated and postresuscitation data obtained. Left ventricular ejection fraction showed a significant reduction 30 min after resuscitation (p < 0. 05). Regional wall motion analysis revealed diffuse, global left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased significantly in the postresuscitation period (p < 0. 05). Isovolumetric relaxation time (tau) was significantly increased over baseline by 2 h after resuscitation (p < 0. 05). Similar findings were noted with the Doppler-echocardiographic analysis, including a reduction in fractional shortening (p < 0. 05), a reduction in mitral <b>valve</b> <b>deceleration</b> time (p < 0. 05) {{and an increase in}} left ventricular isovolumetric relaxation time in 5 h after resuscitation (p < 0. 05). By 24 h, these invasive and noninvasive variables of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function had begun to improve. At 48 h, all measures of left ventricular function had returned to baseline levels. Conclusions. Myocardial systolic and diastolic dysfunction is severe after 10 to 15 min of untreated cardiac arrest and successful resuscitation. Full recovery of this postresuscitation myocardial stunning is seen by 48 h in this experimental model of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Heart {{failure is}} {{associated}} with abnormalities of myocardial structure, and plasma levels of the advanced glycation end-product (AGE) N(ε) -(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) correlate with the severity and prognosis of heart failure. Aging {{is associated with}} diastolic dysfunction and increased risk of heart failure, and we investigated the hypothesis that diastolic dysfunction of aging humans is associated with altered myocardial structure and plasma AGE levels. METHODS: We performed histological analysis of non-ischemic left ventricular myocardial biopsies and measured plasma levels of the AGEs CML and low molecular weight fluorophores (LMWFs) in 26 men undergoing {{coronary artery bypass graft}} surgery who had transthoracic echocardiography before surgery. None had previous cardiac surgery, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, or heart failure. RESULTS: The patients were aged 43 - 78 years and increasing age was associated with echocardiographic indices of diastolic dysfunction, with higher mitral Doppler flow velocity A wave (r =  0. 50, P =  0. 02), lower mitral E/A wave ratio (r =  0. 64, P =  0. 001), longer mitral <b>valve</b> <b>deceleration</b> time (r =  0. 42, P =  0. 03) and lower early diastolic peak velocity of the mitral septal annulus, e' (r =  0. 55, P =  0. 008). However, neither mitral E/A ratio nor mitral septal e' was correlated with myocardial total, interstitial or perivascular fibrosis (picrosirius red), immunostaining for collagens I and III, CML, and receptor for AGEs (RAGE), cardiomyocyte width, capillary length density, diffusion radius or arteriolar dimensions. Plasma AGE levels were not associated with age. However, plasma CML levels were associated with E/A ratio (r =  0. 44, P =  0. 04) and e' (r =  0. 51, P =  0. 02) and LMWF levels were associated with E/A ratio (r =  0. 49, P =  0. 02). Moreover, the mitral E/A ratio remained correlated with plasma LMWF levels in all patients (P =  0. 04) and the mitral septal e' remained correlated with plasma CML levels in non-diabetic patients (P =  0. 007) when age was a covariate. CONCLUSIONS: Diastolic dysfunction of aging was independent of myocardial structure but was associated with plasma AGE levels. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R
40|$|Diagnosis of {{diabetes}} mellitus, presence of hyperglycemia, and/or insulin resistance confer cardiovascular risk, particularly for diastolic dysfunction. Diabetes {{is associated with}} elevated myocardial norepinephrine (NE) content, enhanced sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, altered resting heart rate, and depressed heart rate variability. Positron emission tomography (PET) using the NE analogue [11 C]meta-hydroxyephedrine ([11 C]HED) provides an index of myocardial sympathetic neuronal integrity at the NE reuptake transporter (NET). The hypothesis of this project is that (i) hyperglycemia imparts heightened sympathetic tone and NE release, leading to abnormal sympathetic neuronal function {{in the hearts of}} diabetic rats, and (ii) these abnormalities may be reversed or prevented by treatments to normalize glycemia. Sprague Dawley rats were rendered insulin resistant by high fat feeding and diabetic by a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ). Diabetic rats were treated for 8 weeks with insulin, metformin or rosiglitazone, starting from either 1 week (prevention) or 8 weeks (reversal) after STZ administration. Sympathetic neuronal integrity was evaluated longitudinally by [11 C]HED PET. Echocardiography measures of systolic and diastolic function were completed at serial timepoints. Plasma NE levels were evaluated serially and expression of NET and β-adrenoceptors were tested at the terminal endpoints. Diabetic rats exhibited a 52 - 57 % reduction of [11 C]HED standardized uptake value (SUV) at 8 weeks after STZ, with a parallel 2. 5 -fold elevation of plasma NE and a 17 - 20 % reduction in cardiac NET expression. These findings were confirmed by ex vivo biodistribution studies. Transmitral pulse wave Doppler echocardiography established an extension of mitral <b>valve</b> <b>deceleration</b> time and elevated early to atrial velocity ratio, suggesting diastolic dysfunction. Subsequent treatment with insulin but not metformin restored glycemia, reduced plasma NE by 50 %, normalized NET expression, and recovered [11 C]HED SUV towards non-diabetic age-matched control. Diastolic dysfunction in these rats persisted. By contrast, early treatment with insulin, metformin, or rosiglitazone delayed the progression of diastolic dysfunction, but had no effect on elevated NE and reduced [11 C]HED SUV in diabetic rats, potentially owing to a latent decrease in blood glucose. In conclusion, diabetes is associated with heightened circulating and tissue NE levels which can be effectively reversed by lowering glycemia with insulin. Noninvasive interrogation of sympathetic neuronal integrity using [11 C]HED PET may have added value in the stratification of cardiovascular risk among diabetic patients and in determining the myocardial effects of glycemic therapy...|$|R
40|$|Glucocorticoid {{production}} by {{the adrenal gland}} is regulated by hypothalamicpituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Within cells, glucocorticoid levels are modulated by 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 β-HSD), which interconverts active and intrinsically inert glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids have widespread physiological effects and, in the cardiovascular system, they {{play a crucial role}} in heart development and maturation, blood pressure control, and myocardial calcium cycling. Mice which are unable to regenerate the physiological glucocorticoid, corticosterone, from 11 -dehydrocorticosterone due to deletion of the type 1 11 β-HSD isozyme (11 β-HSD 1) have previously been shown to have smaller, lighter hearts but unaltered systolic function. Moreover, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Hsd 11 b 1 gene has been associated with reduced left ventricular mass in humans, suggesting a role for 11 β-HSD 1 in regulating cardiac size. After myocardial infarction (MI), 11 β-HSD 1 deficient mice have an augmented inflammatory response, increased numbers of pro-reparative alternatively-activated macrophages in the heart, enhanced peri-infarct angiogenesis and improved cardiac function compared to C 57 BL/ 6 controls. However, the role of ‘cardiovascular’ 11 β-HSD 1 in the development of these phenotypes, both basally and after MI, is unknown. It was hypothesised that ‘cardiovascular’ 11 β-HSD 1 deficiency would result in smaller hearts, and that this selective deletion would lead to altered calcium handling protein expression and diastolic abnormalities. Furthermore, it was hypothesised that ‘cardiovascular’ 11 β-HSD 1 deletion would reproduce the beneficial post-MI phenotype previously seen in global 11 β-HSD 1 deficient mice. The first aim was to characterise the cardiac phenotype of mice with global deletion of 11 β-HSD 1 (DelI mice), and mice in which deletion is restricted to cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMAC mice). SMAC mice have ‘floxed’ 11 β- HSD 1 alleles and a Cre recombinase transgene inserted into the Sm 22 α gene. Sm 22 α is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, and transiently in cardiomyocytes during development. Thus, Cre expression in these cells results in deletion of exon three of the Hsd 11 b 1 gene and gives rise to a non-functional protein. Controls for DelI mice were C 57 BL/ 6 mice, and controls for SMAC mice were their Cre- littermates. DelI, but not SMAC, mice have smaller, lighter hearts, which may be explained by their shorter cardiomyocytes measured following isolation using a Langendorff preparation. Cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area is unchanged. In vivo measurement of cardiac function using ultrasound imaging showed systolic function is comparable between DelI mice and SMAC mice and their respective controls. However, there is mild diastolic dysfunction in both DelI and SMAC mice, characterised by reduced E wave deceleration and an increased mitral <b>valve</b> <b>deceleration</b> time. This phenotype occurred following pharmacological inhibition of 11 β-HSD 1, by administration of UE 2316, a selective 11 β-HSD 1 inhibitor, to adult C 57 BL 6 /SJL mice. While ventricular collagen content is unaltered in DelI, SMAC and UE 2316 -treated mice compared to their respective controls, expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + ATPase (SERCA) is reduced, suggesting that altered calcium handling, rather than changes in stiffness, may underlie this phenotype. The second aim was to determine whether the beneficial acute outcomes seen previously in 11 β-HSD 1 deficient mice after MI could be reproduced by selective cardiovascular deletion of the enzyme. Seven days after MI, compared to Cre- littermate controls, SMAC mice have similar peri-infarct angiogenesis, total macrophage and alternatively-activated macrophage infiltration into the heart, infarct size, ventricular dilatation and systolic function. This suggests 11 β-HSD 1 deletion in another cell type, or types, is responsible for the phenotype seen in global 11 β-HSD 1 deficient mice. The final aim was to assess the impact of global 11 β-HSD 1 deficiency and ‘cardiovascular’ 11 β-HSD 1 deletion on the development of heart failure, using magnetic resonance imaging to determine structure and function. Eight weeks after MI, mice globally deficient in 11 β-HSD 1 have attenuated expression of ANP and β- MHC, RNA markers of heart failure, and show attenuated pulmonary oedema, reduced chamber dilatation, preserved systolic function and smaller infarcts compared to control. None of these parameters are altered in SMAC mice relative to control. In conclusion, the data presented in this thesis shows that cardiovascular 11 β-HSD 1 influences physiological cardiac function, potentially through regulation of calcium handling. 11 β-HSD 1 in other cells influences cardiomyocyte length, resulting in smaller hearts in its absence. Despite this, global 11 β-HSD 1 deficiency prevents heart failure development after MI, suggesting that pharmacological inhibition of 11 β-HSD 1 may be of benefit in treating this condition. Cardiovascular 11 β-HSD 1 does not, however, account for the changes in infarct healing or remodelling associated with this beneficial outcome, therefore these effects must be related to 11 β-HSD 1 deficiency elsewhere, such as fibroblasts or myeloid cells...|$|R
