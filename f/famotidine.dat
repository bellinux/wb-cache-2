25|$|The {{development}} of longer-acting H2 receptor antagonists with fewer drug interactions and adverse effects, such as ranitidine and <b>famotidine,</b> decreased {{the use of}} cimetidine, and though it is still used, cimetidine is no longer among the more widely used of the H2-receptor antagonists.|$|E
25|$|The more {{recently}} developed H2-receptor antagonists {{are less likely}} to alter CYP metabolism.

25|$|H2-receptor antagonists: include {{cimetidine}} (Tagamet), <b>famotidine</b> (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid), and ranitidine (Zantac). Reduced secretion of {{gastric acid}} and pepsin produced by H2 blockers can reduce absorption of protein-bound (dietary) vitamin B12, {{but not of}} supplemental vitamin B12. Gastric acid is needed to release vitamin B12 from protein for absorption. Clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency and megaloblastic anemia are unlikely, unless H2 blocker therapy is prolonged (2 years or more), or the person's diet is poor. It is also more likely {{if the person is}} rendered achlorhydric(with complete absence of gastric acid secretion), which occurs more frequently with proton pump inhibitors than H2 blockers. Vitamin B12 levels should be monitored in people taking high doses of H2 blockers for prolonged periods.|$|E

50|$|Proton pump inhibitors (such as {{omeprazole}} and lansoprazole) and histamine H2-receptor antagonists (such as <b>famotidine</b> and ranitidine) {{are used}} to slow acid secretion. Once gastric acid is suppressed, symptoms normally improve.|$|E
50|$|<b>Famotidine,</b> {{sold under}} the trade name Pepcid among others, is a {{histamine}} H2 receptor antagonist that inhibits stomach acid production. It {{is commonly used}} {{in the treatment of}} peptic ulcer disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease.|$|E

50|$|Vagotomy is an {{essential}} component of surgical management of peptic (duodenal and gastric) ulcer disease (PUD). Vagotomy was once commonly performed to treat and prevent PUD. However, with the availability of excellent acid secretion control with H2 receptor antagonists, such as cimetidine, ranitidine, and <b>famotidine,</b> and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as pantoprazole, rabeprazole, omeprazole, and lansoprazole, the need for surgical management of peptic ulcer disease has greatly decreased.|$|E

50|$|Glaxo refined {{the model}} further by {{replacing}} the imidazole ring of cimetidine with a furan ring with a nitrogen-containing substituent, {{and in doing}} so developed ranitidine. Ranitidine was found to have a far-improved tolerability profile (i.e. fewer adverse drug reactions), longer-lasting action, and 10 times the activity of cimetidine. Ranitidine has 10% of the affinity that cimetidine has to CYP450, so it causes fewer side effects, but other H2 blockers <b>famotidine</b> and nizatidine have no CYP450 significant interactions.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} {{anaesthetic}} premedication is the preoperative administration of beta adrenergic antagonists {{to reduce the}} incidence of postoperative hypertension, cardiac dysrhythmia, or myocardial infarction. Anaesthesiologists may administer an antiemetic agent such as ondansetron, droperidol, or dexamethasone to prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting, or subcutaneous heparin or enoxaparin to {{reduce the incidence of}} deep vein thrombosis. Other commonly used premedication agents include opioids such as fentanyl or sufentanil, gastrokinetic agents such as metoclopramide, and histamine antagonists such as <b>famotidine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Horizon Pharma Public Limited Company (...) is a {{specialty}} pharmaceutical company that develops and markets medicine through its subsidiaries in the United States.

50|$|<b>Famotidine</b> {{suffers from}} poor {{bioavailability}} (50%), {{as it is}} poorly soluble in the low pH of the stomach. When used in combination with antacids, it promotes local delivery of these drugs to the receptor of the parietal cell wall. Therefore, researchers are developing innovative formulations of tablets, such as gastroretentive drug delivery systems. Such tablets are retained in the stomach {{for a longer period}} of time, thereby improving the bioavailability of drugs. Local delivery also increases bioavailability at the stomach wall receptor site and increases the efficacy of drugs to reduce acid secretion.|$|E
5000|$|Concomitant use of {{tizanidine}} {{and moderate}} or potent CYP1A2 inhibitors (such as zileuton, certain antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, verapamil), cimetidine, <b>famotidine,</b> aciclovir, ticlopidine and oral contraceptives) is contraindicated. Concomitant use of tizanidine with fluvoxamine, a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor in man, {{resulted in a}} 33-fold increase in the tizanidine AUC (plasma drug concentration-time curve). [...] Fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin should also be avoided due to an increased serum concentration of tizanidine when administered concomitantly. Tizanidine {{has the potential to}} interact with other CNS depressants. Alcohol should be avoided, particularly as it can upset the stomach. The CNS-depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive.|$|E

50|$|Prophylactic use of both {{omeprazole}} and H2 antagonists such as ranitidine, cimetidine, and <b>famotidine</b> {{can be used}} to {{help prevent}} gastric ulcer formation when the horse will be placed into a stressful situation, such as travel or showing. Ranitidine has been shown to reduce ulceration when given concurrently during feed deprivation trials. H2 antagonists are cheaper and will decrease stomach acid production but require more frequent administration compared to PPIs, usually every eight hours. There are no studies suggesting that H2 antagonists improve the healing of ulcers already present. H2 antagonists require doses much higher than other species to block acid production in the equine stomach, possibly because so little histamine is needed to produce maximal secretion of acid.This is also true for omeprazole doses, especially if given orally.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>famotidine,</b> a new {{histamine}} H 2 -receptor antagonist, on renal tubular creatinine secretion was evaluated in twelve patients with reduced renal function (creatinine clearance 10 - 60 ml min- 1). Creatinine and inulin clearances were determined at baseline and for 4 h after a 10 mg intravenous dose of <b>famotidine.</b> <b>Famotidine</b> renal clearance exceeded inulin clearance {{by an average}} of 152 %, indicating that renal tubular secretion of <b>famotidine</b> occurred. No significant changes in the clearances of creatinine or inulin, or the fractional clearance of creatinine were observed after <b>famotidine</b> administration. These data suggest that <b>famotidine,</b> unlike cimetidine, does not inhibit renal tubular secretion of creatinine. Thus, <b>famotidine</b> does not affect creatinine-dependent measurements of renal function and is unlikely to alter the renal elimination of basic drugs...|$|E

The optimization was performed using the desirability function and contour plots. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed the nanoparticles as spherical in shape. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis indicated that there was substantial crystallinity change in the nanoparticle compared with the pure drug. Ex-vivo mucoadhesion study showed that <b>famotidine</b> mucoadhesive nanoparticles possessed higher mucoadhesion than the <b>famotidine</b> nanoparticles. The in vivo studies on aspirin-induced rats indicated the lowering in ulcer index for <b>famotidine</b> mucoadhesive nanoparticles was 0. 46 + 0. 011, which was significantly better than the effect of traditional <b>famotidine</b> suspension (0. 66 + 0. 035). <b>Famotidine</b> mucoadhesive nanosuspension could be prepared using the media milling technique and allowing significant reduction in ulcer index compared to <b>famotidine</b> suspension...|$|E
40|$|<b>Famotidine</b> {{is a new}} {{histamine}} H 2 -receptor antagonist {{which has}} been demonstrated to be more potent than cimetidine and ranftidine in inhibfting gastric acid secretion.

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies showed}} that esomeprazole does not {{interfere}} significantly with the platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel. It is unknown whether <b>famotidine,</b> a histamine 2 receptor antagonist, interacts with clopidogrel. This double-blind, randomized study aimed to compare the influence of esomeprazole and <b>famotidine</b> on the platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel. Methods: Patients with acute coronary syndrome or elective percutaneous coronary interventions treated with aspirin and clopidogrel cotherapy were randomized to receive esomeprazole 20 mg daily or <b>famotidine</b> 40 mg daily. Platelet reactivity units (PRUs) were measured at baseline and on day 28. The primary analysis involved the PRU values on day 28. Results: There were 44 patients in the esomeprazole group and 44 in the <b>famotidine</b> group. The baseline PRUs of the 2 groups were comparable (esomeprazole vs <b>famotidine,</b> 229. 1 ± 85. 6 vs 220. 4 ± 83. 0, P =. 63). The PRUs on day 28 were 242. 6 ± 89. 7 and 237. 5 ± 79. 2 in the groups receiving esomeprazole and <b>famotidine,</b> respectively (mean difference 5. 1, 95 % CI - 30. 8 to 41. 0, P =. 78). Conclusions: The platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel was not significantly different between patients receiving esomeprazole and those receiving <b>famotidine.</b> Neither esomeprazole nor <b>famotidine</b> reduced the platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel. © 2011 Mosby, Inc.

40|$|Background. Proton pump {{inhibitor}} and histamine- 2 receptor antagonist {{can prevent}} aspirin-related ulcers/erosions but few studies compare {{the efficacy of}} these two agents. Aims. We evaluated the efficacy of omeprazole and <b>famotidine</b> in preventing recurrent ulcers/erosions in low-dose aspirin users. Methods. The 24 -week clinical outcomes of the patients using low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection {{with a history of}} ulcers/erosions and cotherapy of omeprazole or <b>famotidine</b> were retrospectively reviewed. The incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms, recurrent ulcers/erosions, erosive esophagitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and thromboembolic events was analyzed. Results. A total of 104 patients (<b>famotidine</b> group, 49 patients; omeprazole group, 55 patients) were evaluated. <b>Famotidine</b> group had more gastrointestinal symptoms episodes than omeprazole group (46. 9 % versus 23. 6 %, P= 0. 01). Fifteen <b>famotidine</b> group patients and 5 omeprazole group patients had recurrent ulcers/erosions (30. 6 % versus 9. 1 %, P= 0. 005). Lanza scale was significantly lower in omeprazole group than in <b>famotidine</b> group (1. 2 ± 0. 7 versus 1. 7 ± 1. 1, P= 0. 008). Only 1 <b>famotidine</b> group patient had ulcer bleeding. The incidences of erosive esophagitis and thromboembolic events were comparable between both groups. Conclusions. Omeprazole was superior to <b>famotidine</b> with less gastrointestinal symptoms and recurrent ulcers/erosions in patients using 24 -week low-dose aspirin. The risk of erosive esophagitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and thromboembolic events was similar between both groups...|$|E
