40|$|The concept “Building Back Better” (BBB) was {{formally}} introduced following the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, which implies using a collaborative approach {{to improve the}} physical, social and economic conditions of a community during post-disaster reconstruction and recovery. This paper introduces eight BBB Principles which contribute towards achieving BBB. The post-tsunami recovery effort in Sri Lanka was examined using the BBB Principles {{to determine the extent}} to which BBB has been incorporated in immediate and long-term disaster management practices. Reports, literature, and data collected from a site visit made to Sri Lanka in 2010 / 2011 were analysed to establish the findings. Although BBB concepts were recognized, failure in execution resulted in a non-BBB recovery. Lessons learnt from shortcomings have been understood and incorporated into current disaster management practices. <b>Good</b> <b>BBB</b> practices currently in effect include: hazard-based land-use planning and risk-based structural regulations; increased awareness; participatory approaches; and stakeholder training. The absence of legislative support to implement BBB initiatives is the only drawback preventing so far. Lessons from Sri Lanka can benefit disaster management practices worldwide...|$|E
40|$|Recently, 1 -(1, 4 -dioxaspiro[4, 5]dec- 2 -ylmethyl) - 4 -(2 -methoxyphenyl) {{piperazine}} (1) {{was reported}} as a potent 5 -HT 1 AR agonist with a moderate 5 -HT 1 AR selectivity. In {{an extension of}} this work a series of derivatives of 1, obtained by combining different heterocyclic rings with a more flexible amine chain, was synthesized and tested for binding affinity and activity at 5 -HT 1 AR and α 1 adrenoceptors. The results led to the identification of 14 and 15 as novel 5 -HT 1 AR partial agonists, the first being outstanding for selectivity (5 -HT 1 A/α 1 d =  80), the latter for potency (pD 2  =  9. 58) and efficacy (Emax =  74 %). Theoretical studies of ADME properties shows a good profile for the entire series and MDCKII-MDR 1 cells permeability data predict a <b>good</b> <b>BBB</b> permeability of compound 15, which possess a promising neuroprotective activity. Furthermore, in mouse formalin test, compound 15 shows a potent antinociceptive activity suggesting a new strategy for pain control...|$|E

40|$|The {{inhibition}} of single 1, 4 -bis (benzimidazolyl) butane (BBB) and {{the mixture of}} BBB and 0. 1 M NaCl on the corrosion of mild steel in 0. 25 M H 2 SO 4 solution was studied using weight loss and electrochemical methods. Results obtained revealed that BBB and BBB-NaCl mixture suppressed the mild steel corrosion effectively in 0. 25 M H 2 SO 4 solution and inhibition efficiency increases with the increasing BBB concentration. At any concentration, together with chloride ion, BBB is more effective corrosion inhibitor compared to single BBB for mild steel corrosion. Potentiodynamic polarization curves studies showed that single BBB and BBB-NaCl mixture are both mixed inhibitors for the corrosion of mild steel in 0. 25 M H 2 SO 4 solution. The adsorption of BBB and BBB-NaCl mixture on mild steel surface obeys Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The adsorption of BBB-NaCl mixture is stronger than that of <b>BBB.</b> <b>Good</b> synergism exists between NaCl and BBB.

Out of the two methods, microwave methods was found to give better yield. All the synthesized compounds were subjected to physicochemical parameters determination for BBB penetration through online software. The logP values of most of our test compounds indicate that test compounds have the potential to be CNS active. The experimentally determined and calculated values of logP are very much similar to values of logP calculated by the online software chemsilico and are in the range required for good CNS activity. The values of other physicochemical parameters like molecular weight, nON value, nOHNH value, n-violations and the number of rotatable bonds of all the test compounds also lie between the ranges that are required for <b>good</b> <b>BBB</b> penetration. The compounds were screened for the skeletal muscle relaxant activity and from the investigation, it is quite apparent that all the 2 -amino- 5 -chlorobenzophenone derivatives (3 a– 3 g) possess significant differences between control group and treated group, P <  0. 001.

40|$|Polypharmacology-based {{strategies}} are gaining ever-increasing attention as useful approaches to develop disease-modifying drug candidates for effective Alzheimer’s disease (AD) treatment. In this scenario, multitarget-directed ligands could increase efficiency by simultaneous modulation of several targets involved in AD pathogenesis. In drug discovery, natural products (NPs) represent {{an excellent source}} of evolutionary-chosen “privileged structures”. In this thesis, the polyphenol curcumin, found in Curcuma longa L, encompassing the essential structural elements for the concurrent inhibition of two validated AD targets, BACE- 1 and GSK- 3 β, was rationally identified as lead compound. Aimed at developing well-balanced dual BACE- 1 /GSK- 3 β modulators with <b>good</b> <b>BBB</b> permeability, different series of curcumin-based derivatives were designed and synthetized by introducing suitable chemical modifications on the side aryl ring(s) and in the 4 -position of the main scaffold. Furthermore, considering the pivotal role of the intramolecular H-bond network of curcumin’s central fragment in establishing appropriate interactions with target binding sites, several complexation and bioisosteric cyclization strategies were performed. Thanks to its strong Michael acceptor reactivity toward critical cysteine residues, curcumin exerts neuroprotection by additional activation of the Keap 1 -Nrf 2 -ARE signaling pathway. Thus, aimed at affecting the electrophilicity of its α,β-unsaturated carbonyl fragment, allowing a fine-tuning of its reactivity, diverse electrophilic functions were inserted in different positions of the curcumin scaffold. Furthermore, considering the neuroprotective and antioxidant potentials of simple coumarins, several curcumin-coumarin hybrids were also prepared. Recently, the inhibition of additional AD-correlated protein kinases (PKs), such as CK 1 and LRRK 2, could offer promises to achieve a successful treatment and indole was envisaged as useful scaffold for both PKs’ inhibition. Thus, a small library of indole-based derivatives was designed and synthetized as valuable BBB permeable pharmacological tools. Finally, chitosan (CS), a natural, nontoxic, biocompatible and biodegradable polysaccharide, was selected to develop CS-based bioconjugates for nanoparticles’ preparation as innovative drug delivery and targeting systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{transient}} receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV 1) {{channel is}} classified {{as a member of}} the TRP family of ion channels. It is a pH- and heat-sensitive cation channel, but can also be activated by endogenous or naturally occurring or synthetic exogenous ligands. The most general known agonist of TRPV 1 is capsaicin, the pungent compound of the red chilli pepper. TRPV 1 is mainly expressed in a subset of nociceptive neurons, originating in the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia that innervate virtually all tissues (e. g. skin, muscle, bone, internal organs and vascular system). Here it has an established role in pain sensation and the generation and progression of neurogenic inflammation. Therefore, TRPV 1 became a target of interest for pharmaceutical companies for the development of a new class of analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs. Over the past years, intensive research has revealed the presence of TRPV 1 channels in various brain regions. Yet, the extent to which these central TRPV 1 channels are expressed and their exact (patho) physiological role remains to be elucidated. Hypothalamic TRPV 1 receptors have been suggested to play a role in thermoregulation and TRPV 1 -expressing hippocampal neurons may be involved in the control of emotions, learning and epileptic activity. Furthermore, there are hints that TRPV 1 contributes to the pathogenesis of febrile seizures and neurodegenerative brain disorders such as Parkinsons disease. In the present study we aimed on developing carbon- 11 (11 C) and fluorine- 18 (18 F) labelled radioligands to visualise TRPV 1 in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET). A successful PET-radioligand for TRPV 1 could speed up the research to unravel its expression pattern and (patho) physiological role in the central nervous system (CNS), allow the clinical evaluation of therapeutics that target TRPV 1 and provide new diagnostic opportunities for diseases in which TRPV 1 expression or activity is altered. As a first approach, [11 C]SB 366791, a radiolabelled analogue of the potent cinnamic acid derivative SB 366791, was successfully synthesised in good yields, high radiochemical purity and high specific activity. Its preliminary biological evaluation showed promising results including efficient blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, fast clearance from blood and TRPV 1 -selective binding in the trigeminal nerve. Yet, in our hands the experimental in vitro binding affinity of SB 366791 for TRPV 1 was found to be lower than earlier reported values. Next, a subtle change in the structure of SB 366791 led to the development of [11 C]DVV 24, which showed an improved in vitro binding affinity for TRPV 1. As expected, the new tracer displayed a similar distribution pattern, comparable brain uptake and hepatobiliary elimination as observed for [11 C]SB 366791. Yet, [11 C]DVV 24 showed a lower specific accumulation in the trigeminal nerve, which may be due to its slightly higher lipophilicity and faster in vivo metabolism. In a final attempt to develop high affinity tracers for TRPV 1, several highly potent TRPV 1 antagonists belonging to different structural classes including urea derivatives, aminoquinazolines and daphnane diterpenes have been selected from literature data to serve as lead compounds. Labelling of our urea precursor was unsuccessful because of stability problems, but the aminoquinazoline [18 F]DVV 54 and daphnane diterpene 123 I-RTX were efficiently synthesised. Both compounds showed significantly higher in vitro binding affinities for TRPV 1 compared to the cinnamic acid derivatives. Biodistribution studies in mice showed that 123 I-RTX was rapidly cleared from blood by the hepatobiliary pathway. But [18 F]DVV 54 showed much slower kinetics, high in vivo stability and significant non-specific binding, which may result in low target-to-background signals. The brain uptake was low for [18 F]DVV 54 and negligible for 123 I-RTX, in accordance with their unfavourable logD and polar surface area (123 I-RTX) values. Furthermore, 123 I-RTX and [18 F]DVV 54 were not retained in the trigeminal nerve. Likely, the tracers do not reach their target in a sufficient concentration due to extensive plasma protein binding as a result of their too lipophilic nature. An increasing body of evidence associates the TRPV 1 channel with the endocannabinoid system (ECS). In a second part of this thesis we focused on this ECS, which is represented by the two types of cannabinoid receptors (CB 1 and CB 2), their endogenous lipid ligands called endocannabinoids (e. g. anandamide), and all proteins responsible for the transport, degradation and biosynthesis of the endocannabinoids. CB 1 is predominantly expressed in brain, whereas CB 2 receptors are mainly found in cells and organs related to the immune system such as ß-lymphocytes, the spleen and lymph nodes. Yet, low levels of CB 2 have been detected in the healthy brain, whereby its physiological role in the CNS may be underestimated. CB 2 is, however, up-regulated in microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, upon neuroinflammation. CB 2 -positive microglia have been detected in patients and animal models with Alzheimers disease, multiple sclerosis and Huntingtons disease. Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is one of the metabolising enzymes of the ECS and is responsible for the degradation of anandamide. FAAH is co-expressed with CB 1 and thus principally found in brain. Outside the CNS, FAAH is mainly found in liver and kidneys, but protein expression has also been demonstrated in the small intestines, lungs, pancreas, prostate and testes. Alterations in FAAH expression levels and disruption of its activity have been linked with the aetiology of several neuropathogenic disorders such as drug/alcohol abuse, anxiety, depression, epilepsy, Huntingtons disease and Parkinsons disease, amongst others. The idea that modulation of this signalling system could introduce new therapies, led to the development of CB 1 and CB 2 (ant) agonists and several classes of FAAH inhibitors. Some of these compounds already served as lead molecules for the development of accompanying PET-tracers. However, more research is needed to elucidate the expression pattern of CB 2 in the CNS and to clarify the role of FAAH and CB 2 in the above mentioned neurological pathologies. Here we report the radiolabelling, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of two new tracers targeting the ECS. [11 C]MA 2 was successfully synthesised and evaluated for its potential to visualise CB 2 in vivo. Its structure is based on that of an N-arylamide oxadiazole CB 2 -agonist with reported picomolar affinity for CB 2 and good selectivity over CB 1. Due to the high expression levels of CB 2 in the spleen, retention of [11 C]MA 2 in this organ was anticipated. Yet, none of the studied organs showed accumulation of [11 C]MA 2, except the liver due to metabolism and/or excretion of the tracer. This lack of retention has, however, also been observed with some earlier developed PET-tracers for CB 2, which in contrary were shown to bind the human CB 2 receptor in vivo. As [11 C]MA 2 showed <b>good</b> <b>BBB</b> penetration, its potential to bind the human CB 2 receptor was examined by performing a microPET study using an animal model with local overexpression of a hCB 2 variant. Unfortunately, no difference in [11 C]MA 2 binding was observed between the left (control) and right (CB 2 -rich) striatum. In our hands, the binding affinity of MA 2 was found to be rather low, which most likely explains the lack of CB 2 -specific retention of the tracer. It may be that the small structural change that was introduced in the lead molecule to allow radiolabelling has influenced its affinity for CB 2 in a negative manner. Finally, we synthesised a radiolabelled analogue ([11 C]FI- 02) of the potent FAAH inhibitor FI- 02, developed by Merck. Biodistribution studies in mice with [11 C]FI- 02 showed high accumulation in the brain, liver, kidneys and pancreas, all tissues known to express high levels of FAAH. The accumulation was blocked by pretreatment with the FAAH inhibitor URB 597, which suggests that the tracer selectively binds to FAAH. MicroPET experiments in rats confirmed the high brain uptake of [11 C]FI- 02 and showed that binding of the tracer was irreversible. Pretreatment of the animals with URB 597 resulted in a significant increase of the tracer concentration in blood, whereby the time-activity-curves of the brain paralleled those of the blood pool. As URB 597 has been shown to bind other hydrolases as well, additional studies in FAAH knockout mice are needed to confirm the in vivo selectivity of [11 C]FI- 02 for FAAH. In conclusion, of all developed TRPV 1 -tracers, the cinnamic acid derivatives [11 C]SB 366791 and [11 C]DVV 24 displayed the best tracer characteristics including high brain uptake, efficient clearance from blood and TRPV 1 -specific binding. Hence, a major drawback is their relatively low experimentally determined binding affinity for TRPV 1, which makes their potential to visualise TRPV 1 in vivo less likely. [11 C]MA 2 couldnt meet the expectations of a successful CB 2 PET-tracer. Yet, MA 2 provides a basis for the development of new, possibly high affinity derivatives, which may lead to new PET-tracers in the future. Finally, our data suggest that [11 C]FI- 02 is a promising PET-tracer for in vivo mapping of FAAH. Further research will elucidate its potential for clinical applications. nrpages: 180 status: publishe...|$|E

To assess {{the time course of}} BBB modifications, we performed angiography, diffusion-weighted imaging, T 1 -weighted (T 1 W) imaging and T 1 mapping, and monitored acute changes after middle cerebral artery occlusion and recanalization in rats (n = 27). The animals were grouped according to the duration of occlusion: 30 min (group A, n = 8), 1 h 30 min (group B, n = 9), and 2 h 30 min (group C, n = 10). For 17 animals (four in group A, six in group B, and seven in group C), MnCl 2 and dimeglumine gadoterate (Gd-DOTA) were injected at 13 min and 34 min after recanalization, respectively. The 10 remaining animals (control groups) underwent the same acquisition protocols, but no contrast agents were injected. Cell damage was determined 1 h after recanalization on haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. Our results indicate that in the middle cerebral artery occlusion model in the rat, changes in BBB permeability assessed by contrast agent extravasation occur within the first hour of reperfusion, even after an occlusion period not exceeding 30 min. No differences between BBB permeability to Gd-DOTA and Mn 2 + were detected in our experimental conditions. The reduction in apparent diffusion coefficient during occlusion appears to be a <b>good</b> predictor of <b>BBB</b> modifications after reperfusion in this model...|$|R
