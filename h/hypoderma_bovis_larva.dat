40|$|Abstract. Migrating first-instar larvae of Hypoderma Zineatum are a {{frequent}} cause of focal inflammatory lesions in connective tissues of the mediastinum, parietal and visceral pleura, peritoneum, lungs, diaphragm, and other loci. The lesions are characterized grossly by foci of yellowish or greenish gelatinous edema and microscopically by infiltration of the edematous tissue by a dense array of eosinophils. Lesions were recognized {{during a period}} of several weeks in late spring; the timing was attributable to events in the life cycle of the fly. The larvae, which were small (≈ 1 x 4. 5 mm), transparent, and unobtrusive, were recovered from lesions in 12 of 20 cattle in which careful parasitologic examination was made. The life history, pathologic effect and myiasis control programs for Hypoderma lineatum and <b>Hypoderma</b> <b>bovis</b> (Diptera: Oestridae) have recently been re-viewed 3, 4, 13 General aspects of the life cycle of H. li-neatui are well known.

40|$|Ocular infestations by {{arthropods}} {{consist in}} the parasitization {{of the human}} eye, either directly (e. g., some insect larvae causing ophthalmomyiasis) or via arthropods feeding on lachrymal/conjunctival secretions (e. g., some eye-seeking insects, which also act as vectors of eye pathogens). In addition, demodicosis and phthiriasis may also cause eye discomfort in humans. Ophthalmomyiasis by larvae of the families Oestridae, Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae, are frequent causative agents of human ocular infestations. Over the last decades, the extensive use of macrocyclic lactones in cattle has reduced the frequency of infestations by <b>Hypoderma</b> <b>bovis</b> and <b>Hypoderma</b> lineatum (family Oestridae), and consequently, human infestations by these species. A prompt diagnosis of ocular myiasis (e. g., by serological tests) is pivotal for positive prognoses, particularly when the larvae are not detectable during the ophthalmologic examination. Molecular diagnoses may also assist physicians and parasitologists in achieving time-efficient diagnoses of infestations by Oestridae causing myiasis. Finally, due to widespread international travel to exotic destinations, cases of myiasis are increasing in non-endemic areas, therefore requiring physicians to acquire a profound knowledge of the clinical symptoms linked to these infestations to prevent costly, inappropriate treatments or severe complications...|$|R
40|$|Macroscopic {{preparations}} of parasites {{fixed in}} formaldehyde or alcohol don’t fulfill in complete the requests for education, {{as well as}} their determination, mainly because of the toxic fumes and not enough visible structure of fixed parasite. Using the modified С 10 plastination method, parasites from three different phylum were prepared: Plathelminthes: Class Cestoda (Dipilidum caninum, Moniezia spp and larvae from T. Echinococcus granulosus - Echinococcus unilocularis, larvae from T. pisiformis - Cysticercus pisiformis,, larvae from T. hidatigena - Cysticercus tenuicollis), Phylum Nemathelminthes, Class Nematoda, (Ascaris suum, Macracanthorhynchus hirudinaceus, Diro filaria immitis), Phylum Arthropoda, Class Arachnida (tick from the Ixodidae family) and Class Insecta (Gasterophilus intestinalis, <b>Hypoderma</b> <b>bovis).</b> The aim of this study was conserving the parasites in native condition with plastination method and improved determination according to their visible morphologic structure.

40|$|Background: The studies {{reported}} here {{were conducted to}} assess the efficacy of ivermectin long-acting injection (IVM LAI; IVOMEC® GOLD, Merial; 3. 15 % w/v ivermectin) for the treatment and control of natural infestations of cattle by <b>Hypoderma</b> <b>bovis</b> and <b>Hypoderma</b> lineatum, which are the most economically important oestrid flies of cattle in the northern hemisphere. Methods: Cattle selected from herds {{with a history of}} Hypoderma infestation were grouped into blocks of three (Italy, 33 cattle; Germany, 30 cattle) or two (USA, 16 cattle) animals each, on the basis of positivity at the pre-treatment anti-Hypoderma antibody titres. Within each block, animals were randomly allocated to one of the following treatment regimens: saline (control); IVM LAI, administered at the predicted time of occurrence of first-instar larvae (Italy, Germany, USA); IVM LAI, administered at the predicted time of occurrence of second- and/or third-instar larvae (Italy, Germany). All treatments were administered by subcutaneous injection in correspondence of the area anterior to the shoulder at 1 ml/ 50 kg body weight, which corresponds to 630 mcg IVM/kg for IVM LAI. Results: No Hypoderma larvae emerged from animals treated with IVM LAI, whereas live H. lineatum (Italy) or H. <b>bovis</b> (Germany, USA) <b>larvae</b> were collected from saline-treated animals (P < 0. 01). No adverse reactions to treatments were in any of the animals enrolled in the study. Conclusions: The results from this study demonstrate that ivermectin in a long-acting formulation is 100 % efficacious in the treatment of cattle naturally infested by H. bovis and H. lineatum larvae at all stages of development. IVM LAI can, therefore, be used as 'prophylactic' treatment for Hypoderma spp. infestations in absence of external evidence of their presence and thus prior to skin and carcass damage, and as 'therapeutic' treatment, when warbles are already present...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{efficacy}} of eprinomectin in an extended-release injection (ERI) formulation was determined in cattle harboring naturally acquired infestations of first- or second- and third-stage larvae of Hypoderma spp. in three studies conducted {{according to the}} same protocol in the USA (two studies) and Germany (one study). Thirty cattle sourced from herds {{with a history of}} Hypoderma infestation were included in each study. Cattle were formed into replicates of three animals each on the basis of pre-treatment anti-Hypoderma antibody titers. Within replicates each animal was randomly allocated to one of the following treatments: ERI vehicle (control) at 1 mL/ 50 kg bodyweight, administered once on Day 0; Eprinomectin 5 % ERI at 1 mL/ 50 kg bodyweight (1. 0 mg eprinomectin/kg), administered once on Day 0 (when larvae were expected to be first instars); or Eprinomectin 5 % ERI at 1 mL/ 50 kg bodyweight (1. 0 mg eprinomectin/kg), administered once when larvae were second or third instars (study dependent, Day 73, 119, or 140). Treatments were administered by subcutaneous injection in front of the shoulder. In all studies, emerging and/or expressed Hypoderma larvae were recovered, speciated, and counted and viability was determined.

40|$|PERSPECTIVES AND OVERVIEW Two {{species of}} cattle grubs (Diptera: Oestridae) affect cattle in the Northern Hemisphere: Hypoderma iineatum, the {{common cattle grub}} or lesser cattle warble fly, and <b>Hypoderma</b> <b>bovis,</b> the {{northern}} cattle grub or larger cattle warble fly. The word warble is Anglo-Saxon for boil. Adults of the cattle grub {{are commonly known as}} heel flies, warble flies, bomb flies, or gad flies. This parasite has been observed and recorded for centuries (159), and Bracy Clark (50) cited and discussed references from Biblical times to Shakespeare. Scientific observations on the biology were first recorded in the 1700 s by Vallisnieri (cited in 224) in Italy, followed by an extensive review and taxonomic description by Brauer (34) in Austria in the mid 19 th century. Major contributions followed in England by Ormerod (157) and Imms (93); in the United States by Riley (179), Osborn (158), Bishopp et al (24), and Mote (132); and in Canada by Hadwen (85). Other reviews completed before the widespread use of systemic insecticides for cattle-grub control include work by James (94) and Scharff (185) in the United States, Gansser in Austria (69), Gebauer in Germany (70), Grunin in Russia (81), Natvig in Norway (141), MacDougall in Scotland (124), and Bevan 2 ̆ 6 Edwards (22) in England. The quality of these reviews makes it unnecessary to repeat detailed information about the stage descriptions and life cycles for these two important species.

40|$|Hypodermosis is a myiasis {{of cattle}} mainly {{found in the}} Northern Hemisphere. In Italy it has been {{reported}} primarily in southern regions with a farm prevalence reaching a peak of 85 %, while few data are available in the north of the country. This paper reports the results of a serological survey carried out on hypodermosis in Vicenza province (northeastern Italy). During January and February 1999, bulk milk samples were collected from 224 dairy farms and tested, using an hypodermosis ELISA kit. Epidemiological data, such as farm location, herd size, number of cows, grazing management, treatments against Hypoderma larvae, presence of imported animals, were gathered and statistically analysed in relation to the serological results. In 15 farms the presence of warbles was monitored by manual palpation and larvae collected for identification. Ninety-seven (43. 3 %) samples were detected as positive, whereas 12 (5. 4 %) and 115 (51. 3 %) were inconclusive and negative, respectively. Thirteen farms were positive upon parasitological examination and the larvae collected were identified as <b>Hypoderma</b> <b>bovis.</b> Seroprevalence was highly correlated with the practice of free grazing and slightly, but significantly, correlated with the number of cows on the farm. The mean antibody level of positive herds was significantly higher on farms without imported animals. On farms with warbled animals there was a high inverse correlation between antibody level and quantity of milk in the tanks and the number of lactating cows. The ELISA test on bulk milk samples has been shown, under field conditions, to be a useful, cost-effective and easy test for the diagnosis of bovine hypodermosis. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the presence and the seroprevalence of hypodermosis in Albania, 625 head of cattle were bled during two sampling seasons (i. e. from February to March 2003 and from November to December 2003). The cattle came from three collection sites in Northern (site A), Central (site B) and Southern (site C) Albania. Milk samples were collected monthly from four animals from October 2002 to May 2003 during the lactating period. The animals were also clinically examined {{for the presence of}} warbles by manual palpation from April to July 2003 and 2004 and third instar larvae were collected and morphologically identified. Serum and milk samples were processed by ELISA. One hundred and thirty-three (38. 6 %) out of 344 and 116 (41. 3 %) out of 281 animals were found to be seropositive for Hypoderma during the first and the second sampling season. In particular, the animals from site C presented the highest percentage of seropositive results (i. e. 72. 8 % and 97. 8 % in the first and in second year, respectively) followed by the animals from sites A (i. e. 35. 8 % and 23. 8 % in the first and in second year, respectively) and B (i. e. 17. 8 % and 3. 4 % in the first and in second year, respectively). The kinetics of anti-Hypoderma antibodies in milk samples showed the highest antibody titres from October to February 2003. All the seropositive animals in both the sampling periods showed the presence of one or more warbles under the skin during April and May 2003 and 2004 and the third-stage larvae collected were morphologically identified as <b>Hypoderma</b> <b>bovis.</b> The results of this survey indicate that hypodermosis is widespread in Albania and that early prophylactic treatments must be carried out accordingly.
