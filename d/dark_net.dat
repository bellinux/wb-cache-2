2500|$|Other {{aspects of}} Blake's mythology also begin to emerge during the poem. For example, Damon {{argues that the}} death of the four unnamed daughters and the {{corruption}} of the fifth is Blake's first presentation of {{the death of the}} four senses and the corruption of touch, or sex; [...] "all imaginative activity based on the senses disappears except automatic sexual reproduction. Even this proves too much for his moral virtue." [...] As Damon elaborates, [...] "Hela's Medusan locks are the torturing thoughts of suppressed lust." [...] The corruption of the senses plays an important role throughout Europe a Prophecy ("the five senses whelm'd/In deluge o'er the earth-born man"), The Book of Urizen ("The senses inwards rush'd shrinking,/Beneath the <b>dark</b> <b>net</b> of infection"), The Song of Los ("Thus the terrible race of Los & Enitharmon gave/Laws & Religions to the sons of Har binding them more/And more to Earth: closing and restraining:/Till a Philosophy of Five Senses was complete"), The Four Zoas ("Beyond the bounds of their own self their senses cannot penetrate") and Jerusalem ("As the Senses of Men shrink together under the Knife of flint").|$|E

6000|$|Then, {{just as we}} were {{thinking}} of repose, the watchmen of the schooner would hail a splash of paddles away in the starlit gloom of the bay; a voice would respond in cautious tones, and our serang, putting his head down the open skylight, would inform us without surprise, [...] "That Rajah, he coming. He here now." [...] Karain appeared noiselessly {{in the doorway of the}} little cabin. He was simplicity itself then; all in white; muffled about his head; for arms only a kriss with a plain buffalo-horn handle, which he would politely conceal within a fold of his sarong before stepping over the threshold. The old sword-bearer's face, the worn-out and mournful face so covered with wrinkles that it seemed to look out through the meshes of a fine <b>dark</b> <b>net,</b> could be seen close above his shoulders. Karain never moved without that attendant, who stood or squatted close at his back. He had a dislike of an open space behind him. It was more than a dislike--it resembled fear, a nervous preoccupation of what went on where he could not see. This, in view of the evident and fierce loyalty that surrounded him, was inexplicable. He was there alone in the midst of devoted men; he was safe from neighbourly ambushes, from fraternal ambitions; and yet more than one of our visitors had assured us that their ruler could not bear to be alone. They said, [...] "Even when he eats and sleeps there is always one on the watch near him who has strength and weapons." [...] There was indeed always one near him, though our informants had no conception of that watcher's strength and weapons, which were both shadowy and terrible. We knew, but only later on, when we had heard the story. Meantime we noticed that, even during the most important interviews, Karain would often give a start, and interrupting his discourse, would sweep his arm back with a sudden movement, to feel whether the old fellow was there. The old fellow, impenetrable and weary, was always there. He shared his food, his repose, and his thoughts; he knew his plans, guarded his secrets; and, impassive behind his master's agitation, without stirring the least bit, murmured above his head in a soothing tone some words difficult to catch.|$|E

40|$|Is more always better? Is {{conventional}} wisdom always the right guideline {{in the development}} of security policies that have large opportunity costs? Is the evaluation of security measures after their introduction the best way? In the past, these questions were frequently left unasked before the introduction of many public security measures. In this paper we put forward the new paradigm that agent-based simulations are an effective and most likely the only sustainable way for the evaluation of public security measures in a complex environment. As a case-study we provide a critical assessment of the power of Telecommunications Data Retention (TDR), which was introduced in most European countries, despite its huge impact on privacy. Up to now it is unknown whether TDR has any benefits in the identification of terrorist <b>dark</b> <b>nets</b> in the period before an attack. The results of our agent-based simulations suggest, contrary to {{conventional wisdom}}, that the current practice of acquiring more data may not necessarily yield higher identification rates...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} well known {{techniques}} to observe criminal {{activities on the}} Internet by monitoring its traffic.

Another solution consists in centralizing firewall logs and intrusion detection system alerts to extract some information. In this paper, we advocate the usefulness of a third approach {{that focuses on the}} need of local views to get more precise information on some attacks. With this idea in mind, we have developed and deployed for the last six months a distributed honeypot environment in several distinct countries. We show in this paper that 1) local sensors present strong similarities to a certain degree, and 2) they also highlight very clear local patterns. As a conclusion, we demonstrate the usefulness of distributed honeypots and we hope to encourage more partners {{from all over the world}} to join our honeypot, named the Leurre. co...|$|R

2500|$|Net {{photosynthesis}} in {{the water}} column is determined by the interaction between the photic zone and the mixed layer. [...] Turbulent mixing by wind energy at the ocean's surface homogenises the water column vertically until the turbulence dissipates (creating the aforementioned mixed layer). [...] The deeper the mixed layer, the lower the average amount of light intercepted by phytoplankton within it. [...] The mixed layer can vary from being shallower than the photic zone, to being much deeper than the photic zone. [...] When it is much deeper than the photic zone, this results in phytoplankton spending too much time in the <b>dark</b> for <b>net</b> growth to occur. [...] The maximum depth of the mixed layer in which net growth can occur is called the critical depth. [...] As long as there are adequate nutrients available, net primary production occurs whenever the mixed layer is shallower than the critical depth.|$|R
