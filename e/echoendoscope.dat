40|$|AbstractA {{prototype}} forward-viewing <b>echoendoscope</b> {{has been}} developed for therapeutic endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). The hard tip of the forward-viewing <b>echoendoscope,</b> which is shorter {{than that of the}} convex type <b>echoendoscope,</b> can be maneuvered flexibly. Using the forward-viewing <b>echoendoscope,</b> the gastrointestinal wall can be vertically punctured along the same axis as the scope, and this process is done more easily than with an oblique-viewing <b>echoendoscope.</b> The diagnostic accuracy of EUS-FNA with the forward-viewing <b>echoendoscope</b> is 97. 4 %, which is not significantly different to that of the oblique-viewing <b>echoendoscope.</b> The forward-viewing <b>echoendoscope</b> may be useful in situations where the location and procedure are difficult with the oblique-viewing scope, The forward-viewing <b>echoendoscope</b> is able to puncture the gastrointestinal wall vertically with minimal effort, therefore allowing therapeutic EUS procedures such as pseudocyst and abscess drainage, biliary drainage, and pancreatic duct drainage to be performed easily. However, {{a significant difference between the}} forward-viewing and oblique-viewing echoendoscopes in pseudocyst drainage has been reported recently. In the future, the forward-viewing and oblique-viewing echoendoscopes will probably be selectively used depending on not only lesion site but also the procedure required in individual patients, thereby facilitating various processes including puncture, tissue collection, and diagnosis, as well as therapeutic procedures...|$|E
40|$|EUS-guided {{drainage}} of pancreatic fluid collections (PFCs) {{is commonly}} performed with oblique-viewing echoendoscopes. However, accessing the PFC under an oblique angle can make drainage difficult. These difficulties might {{be overcome by}} using a forward-viewing <b>echoendoscope.</b> To compare endoscopic PFC drainage with an oblique-viewing versus a forward-viewing <b>echoendoscope</b> with emphasis on ease of endoscopic drainage. Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. Four tertiary-care referral centers. This study involved 58 patients with PFCs. Patients with PFCs (≥ 6 cm) in whom drainage was indicated were randomized to receive EUS-guided drainage with a forward-viewing <b>echoendoscope</b> or an oblique-viewing <b>echoendoscope.</b> In cases of failed drainage, patients were crossed {{over to the other}} study arm. Ease of EUS-guided drainage measured by procedure time. Secondary endpoints included technical success, EUS endoscope preference, clinical success, and adverse events. Fifty-eight consecutive patients underwent randomization, of whom 52 were available for primary endpoint analysis. All 26 EUS-guided procedures done with the oblique-viewing <b>echoendoscope</b> and 24 of the 26 procedures done with the forward-viewing <b>echoendoscope</b> were technically successful. Mean (± standard deviation) procedure time was 24 : 55 ± 9 : 58 minutes in the forward-viewing <b>echoendoscope</b> group and 27 : 04 ± 9 : 58 minutes in the oblique-viewing <b>echoendoscope</b> group (P =. 44). Median overall procedure ease was graded as equal (easy) in both groups. Drainage-related adverse events occurred in 2 patients (8 %) in the forward-viewing <b>echoendoscope</b> group versus none in the oblique-viewing <b>echoendoscope</b> group (P =. 56). Overall clinical success was achieved in 82 % of patients (95 % confidence interval, 69 %- 91 %). Derived main outcome parameter and highly specialized endoscopists in tertiary-care referral centers. This multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing the performance of oblique-viewing echoendoscopes and forward-viewing echoendoscopes in draining PFCs did not show a difference in ease of EUS-guided drainage or procedure safety and efficacy between the forward-viewing <b>echoendoscope</b> and the oblique-viewing <b>echoendoscope.</b> Clinical success was achieved in 82 % of patient...|$|E

40|$|Endoscopic {{ultrasonography}} (EUS) is {{the most}} accurate procedure for detecting and diagnosing subepithelial tumors, due to its higher sensitivity and specificity than other imaging modalities. EUS can characterize lesions by providing information on echogenic origin, size, borders, homogeneity, {{and the presence of}} echogenic or anechoic foci. Linear <b>echoendoscopes,</b> and recently also electronic radial <b>echoendoscopes,</b> can be used with color Doppler or power Doppler to assess the vascular signals from subepithelial masses, and thus permit the differentiation of vascular structures from cysts, as well as the assessment of the tumor blood supply. However, the diagnostic accuracy of EUS imaging alone {{has been shown to be}} low in subepithelial lesions with 3 rd and 4 th layers. It is also difficult to differentiate exactly between benign and malignant tumors and to gain an accurate picture of histology using EUS. On the other hands, EUS guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) can provide samples for cytologic or histologic analysis. Hypoechoic lesions of the 3 rd and the 4 th EUS layers, more than in 1 cm diameter are recommended, and histologic confirmation using endoscopic submucosal resection or EUS-FNA should be obtained when possible. Therefore, EUS-FNA plays an important role in the clinical management of subepithelial tumors. Furthermore improvements in endoscopic technology are expected to be more useful modalities in differential diagnosis and discrimination between benign and malignant subepithelial tumors...|$|R

These images were captured electronically by a miniature electromagnetic tracking sensor attached to the tip of the <b>echoendoscope</b> (Fig. 1). This system, therefore, allowed simultaneous 3 -D visualization throughout the scanning process (image revision rate: 15 – 20 times/s) and real-time guidance during interventions.

40|$|Most endosonographers use radial {{scanning}} {{instruments for}} diagnostic imaging, and use longitudinal scanning instruments primarily for endoscopic ultrasoundguided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). The use of two separate instruments for radial and longitudinal scanning means 2 different echoendoscopes are required,each {{with its own}} dedicated US processing unit. Currently available electronic radial echoendoscopes and linear instruments made by the same company require the same other brand US unit. Furthermore,no forward-viewing optics type 360 °electronic radial <b>echoendoscope</b> currently exists. We have developed an all-in-one one cart EUS system that saves space and is available for both the forward-viewing type 360 °radial electronic <b>echoendoscope</b> and the oblique-viewing type convex <b>echoendoscope.</b> These scopes have a transducer with variable frequency (5. 0, 7. 5, 10. 0, 12. 0 MHz) and color and power Doppler flow mapping capabilities.

These new instruments provided satisfactory US and endoscopic images. The forward-viewing optics of the prototype enhanced intubation and instrument advancement. The radial scanning prototype provided an adequate diagnosis in 8 (100 %) out of 8 lesions for EUS.

40|$|Background: Patients {{undergoing}} EUS usually receive intravenously administered sedative medication. A double-blind, prospective, randomized {{trial was}} conducted to compare midazolam with a placebo for EUS of the esophagus and stomach and to assess patient tolerance and endoscopic feasibility. Methods: A total of 111 patients were randomized to receive midazolam or a placebo. Patients used a visual analogue scale to score pre-EUS anxiety and tolerance for the procedure. Endoscopists used a visual analogue scale to score ease of <b>echoendoscope</b> introduction and overall patient cooperation. Subsequent to EUS, patients {{were asked if they}} were willing to undergo the procedure under the same conditions. Results: The patients' visual analogue scale scores indicated that tolerance for the introduction of the <b>echoendoscope</b> and the procedure overall were both significantly better in the midazolam group. Overall patient tolerance was predicted by sedation (p < 0. 001) and pre-EUS anxiety (p = 0. 024).

40|$|Oesophageal {{cancer is}} an {{aggressive}} malignancy {{with an overall}} five-year survival of 5 - 10 % and two-thirds of patients have irresectable disease at diagnosis. Accurate staging of oesophageal cancer is important as survival closely correlates with {{the stage of the}} tumour, nodal involvement and presence of metastases (TNM staging). Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is currently the most reliable modality for providing accurate T and N staging. Depending on findings of the staging, various treatment options including endoscopic, oncological, and surgical treatments may be performed. It was theorised that the development of three-dimensional radial endoscopic ultrasonography would reduce the operator dependence of EUS and provide accurate dimensional and volume measurements to aid planning and monitoring of treatment. This thesis investigates the development of a three dimensional endoscopic ultrasound technique that can be used with the radial <b>echoendoscopes.</b> Various agar-based tissue mimicking material (TMM) recipes were characterised using a scanning acoustic macroscope to obtain the acoustic properties of attenuation, backscatter and speed of sound. Using these results, a number of endoscopic ultrasound phantoms were developed for the in-vitro investigation and evaluation of 3 D-EUS techniques. To increase my understanding of EUS equipment, the imaging and acoustic properties of the EUS endoscopes were characterised using a pipe phantom and a hydrophone. The dual ‘single element’ mechanical and ‘multi-element’ electronic <b>echoendoscopes</b> were investigated. Measured imaging properties included dead space, low contrast penetration, and pipe length. The measured acoustic properties included transmitted beam plots, active working frequency and peak pressures. Three-dimensional ultrasound techniques were developed for specific application to EUS. This included the study of positional monitoring systems, reconstruction algorithms and measurement techniques. A 3 D-EUS system was developed using a Microscribe positional arm and frame grabber card, to acquire the 3 D dataset. A Matlab 3 D-EUS toolbox was written to reconstruct and analyse the volumes. The 3 D-EUS systems were evaluated on the EUS phantom and in clinical cases. The usefulness of the 3 D-EUS systems was evaluated in a cohort of patients, who were routinely investigated by conventional EUS for a variety of upper gastrointestinal pathology. 3 D-EUS accurately staged early tumours and provided the necessary anatomical information to facilitate treatment. With regards to more advanced tumours, 3 D-EUS was more accurate than EUS in T and N staging. 3 D-EUS gave useful anatomical details in a variety of benign conditions such as varicies and GISTs.

Two types of dedicated <b>echoendoscopes</b> are commercially available each with their own advantages. Thinner instruments with higher resolutions, that will go through a normal endoscope are currently in development. With these probes differentiation between T 1 and T in situ will be possible in the near future. Characterization of 'submucosal' lesions in the upper gastrointestinal tract is a field in which ES is the most reliable technique for determining the origin of these lesions. Also submucosal vessels are easily visualized and ES is acquiring an important role in the investigation of portal hypertension. ES is the most accurate staging technique for oesophageal and gastric carcinoma as well as for gastric lymphoma. T- and N-staging results are superior to CT scanning, although ES is not very reliable in individual lymph nodes.

Measures {{to improve the}} safety of EUS und EUS-FNB will be discussed. Due to the specific mechanical properties of <b>echoendoscopes</b> in EUS, there is a low but noteworthy risk of perforation. To minimize this risk, endoscopists should {{be familiar with the}} specific features of their equipment and their patients&#x 2019; specific anatomical situations (e. g., tumor stenosis, diverticula). Most diagnostic EUS complications occur during EUS-FNB. Pain, acute pancreatitis, infection and bleeding are the primary adverse effects, occurring in 1 % to 2 % of patients. Only a few cases of needle tract seeding and peritoneal dissemination have been reported. The mortality associated with EUS and EUS-FNB is 0. 02 %. The risks associated with EUS-FNB are affected by endoscopist experience and target lesion. EUS-FNB of cystic lesions is associated with an increased risk of infection and hemorrhage. Peri-interventional antibiotics are recommended to prevent cyst infection. Adequate education and training, as well consideration of contraindications, are essential to minimize the risks of EUS and EUS-FNB.

40|$|Solid {{masses of}} the {{pancreas}} represent a variety of benign and malignant neoplasms of the exocrine and endocrine tissues of the pancreas. A tissue diagnosis is often required to direct therapy {{in the face of}} uncertain diagnosis or if the patient is not a surgical candidate either due to advanced disease or comorbidities. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a relatively new technology that employs endoscopy and high-frequency ultrasound (US). EUS involves imaging of the pancreatic head and the uncinate from the duodenum and imaging of the body and tail from the stomach. It {{has been shown to be}} a highly sensitive method for the detection of pancreatic masses. It is superior to extracorporeal US and computed tomographic (CT) scans, especially when the pancreatic tumor is smaller than 2 - 3 cm. Although EUS is highly sensitive in detecting pancreatic solid masses, its ability to differentiate between inflammatory masses and malignant disease is limited. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) brushing, CT-guided biopsies, and transabdominal ultrasound (US) have been the standard nonsurgical methods for obtaining a tissue diagnosis of pancreatic lesions, but a substantial false-negative rate has been reported. Transabdominal US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (US-FNAB) has been used for tissue diagnosis in patients with suspected pancreatic carcinoma. It has been shown to be highly specific, with no false-positive diagnoses. With the advent of curvilinear <b>echoendoscopes,</b> transgastric and transduodenal EUS-FNAB of the pancreas have become a reality EUS with FNAB has revolutionized the ability to diagnose and stage cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and assess the pancreas.

The pancreas is another organ that is well visualized with EUS. Abnormalities such as tumors and cysts of the pancreas can be carefully evaluated using EUS and then biopsied with FNAB. There are many new applications of EUS using FNAB. Researchers are looking to deliver chemotherapeutics into small pancreatic cancers and cysts. Nerve blocks using EUS/FNAB to inject numbing medicines into the celiac ganglia, a major nerve cluster, are now routinely performed in patients with pain due to pancreatic cancer.

40|$|Context EUS-guided {{transmural}} drainage of {{pancreatic pseudocyst}} {{has been reported}} using a linear array echoendoscope; however, placement of large 10 French stent was not feasible because of the limited diameter of the working channel. Recently linear array echoendoscopes with large working channel (3. 7 to 3. 8 mm) and newer accessories for pancreatic cyst puncture have become available; however, clinical data on their efficacy and safety in pancreatic pseudocyst drainage is not available.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Esophageal cancer staging {{has been}} {{performed}} through bronchoscopy, computerized tomography (CT), {{positron emission tomography}} (PET), and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). Whereas CT and PET scan provide assessments of distant metastasis, bronchoscopy importantly diagnoses tracheobronchial involvement, complementing chest CT findings. EUS is the most accurate examination for T and N staging but is technically limited when tumoral stenoses cannot be traversed. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) appears to present greater accuracy than EUS, CT, and bronchoscopy for assessing tracheobronchial wall involvement. EBUS has been recently associated with EUS for esophageal cancer staging in our unit. OBJECTIVE: To compare EBUS findings in esophageal cancer patients without evident signs of tracheobronchial invasion on conventional bronchoscopy with EUS and CT. METHODS: Fourteen patients with esophageal cancer underwent CT, conventional bronchoscopy, EUS, and EBUS for preoperative staging. All patients underwent EBUS and EUS with an Olympus® MH- 908 <b>echoendoscope</b> at 7. 5 MHz. Seven patients were eligible for the study according to the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: The <b>echoendoscope</b> could not traverse tumoral esophageal stenosis to perform EUS in two patients, and invasion was effectively diagnosed by EBUS. In 4 (57 %) of 7 patients EBUS revealed additional information to staging. In the remaining 3 cases the invasion findings were the same under both EUS and EBUS. CONCLUSION: EBUS showed signs of tracheobronchial invasion not observed by conventional bronchoscopy, adding information to staging {{in most of the}} cases when compared with CT and EUS...|$|E
40|$|Endoscopic {{ultrasonography}} (EUS) combines endoscopy and intraluminal ultrasonography, {{and allows}} imaging with a high-frequency transducer over {{a short distance}} to generate high-resolution ultrasonographic images. EUS is now a widely accepted modality for diagnosing pancreatobiliary diseases. EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) using a curved linear-array <b>echoendoscope</b> was initially described more than 20 years ago, and since then many researchers have expanded its indications to sample diverse lesions and have also used it for various therapeutic purposes. EUS-guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) {{is one of the}} therapeutic procedures that has been developed using a curved linear-array <b>echoendoscope.</b> Technically, EUS-BD includes rendezvous techniques via transesophageal, transgastric, and transduodenal routes, EUS-guided choledochoduodenostomy (EUS-CDS), and EUS-guided hepaticogastrostomy (EUS-HGS). Published data have demonstrated a high success rate, albeit with a comparatively high rate of nonfatal complications for EUS-CDS and EUS-HGS, and a comparatively low success rate with a low complication rate for the rendezvous technique. At present, these procedures represent an alternative to surgery or percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) for patients with obstructive jaundice when endoscopic biliary drainage (EBD) has failed. However, these procedures should be performed in centers with extensive experience in linear EUS and therapeutic biliary ERCP. Large prospective studies are needed in the near future to establish standardized EUS-BD procedures as well as to perform controlled comparative trials between EUS-BD and PTBD, between rendezvous techniques and direct-access techniques (EUS-CDS and EUS-HGS), and between EBD and EUS-BD...|$|E
40|$|Background: Endoscopic {{ultrasound}} (EUS) guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) and biopsy (FNB) {{is considered}} a very accurate and safe tool for sampling extra-intestinal tumors. Standard echoendosocopes for FNA/FNB are large with a sharpened tip that {{can be associated with}} complications. A new slim linear <b>echoendoscope</b> have been developed trying to overcome this limitation. Aim: Of {{the present study was to}} evaluate the feasibility; safety and diagnostic yield of this newly developed slim <b>echoendoscope</b> for performing EUS-guided FNA/FNB. Methods: A pilot observational study was performed. Consecutive patients submitted for a EUS-FNA/FNB were prospectively included in the study. Patients underwent EUS procedure using the new slim linear PENTAX-echoendoscope. Tissue acquisition was done with standard and histology needles. Feasibility and diagnostic yield were evaluated. A descriptive analysis was performed. Results: 87 patients were included (mean age 66. 7 years (range 24 - 90 years), 45 male. Mean size was of lesions sampled were 33. 43 ± 20. 8 mm. Esophagus intubation and access to the second portion of the duodenum (D 2) were considered easy in all 87 cases (100 %). Nineteen procedures (21. 8 %) were performed from the esophagus, 42 (48. 3 %) from the stomach, 22 (25. 3 %) cases from duodenal bulb, and 4 (4. 6 %) cases from D 2. EUS-FNB was feasible in 85 cases (97. 7 %), failed in 2 pancreatic lesions accessed from D 2. Diagnostic yield was 86. 21 % (95 %CI 77. 4 - 91. 9) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 88. 24 % (95 %CI 79. 7 - 93. 5) in per-protocol analysis. There were no complications related to the technique. Conclusion: Performing a EUS-FNA/FNB with the newly designed slim scope is feasible and safe for cyto-histopathology diagnosis of intra-intestinal and extra-intestinal mass lesions...|$|E
40|$|An 83 -year-old man was {{admitted}} to our department, presenting with jaundice, fever, and nausea. CT revealed a pancreatic head tumor with duodenal invasion. Endoscopic transpapillary biliary drainage was unsuccessful due to stenosis at the second portion of the duodenum and tumor invasion to the papilla of Vater. Using a convex linear array <b>echoendoscope,</b> a fully-covered metal stent was placed across the puncture tract to bridge the duodenum and the bile duct. After improvement of jaundice, a duodenal metal stent was placed across the stricture of the duodenum. No procedure-related complications occurred. Neither migration nor obstruction of the two stents was observed during the three months followup period. Combination of ESBD using a fully covered metal stent and duodenal stenting is a feasible technique and possibly a less invasive treatment option for malignant biliary and duodenal obstruction compared to surgery...|$|E
40|$|A 50 -year-old man was {{admitted}} to our department, complaining of epigastric pain and high fever. CT revealed a pseudocyst at the pancreatic head with upstream dilatation of the pancreatic duct (PD) and fluid collection surrounding the pancreas. Endosonography-guided PD drainage (ESPD) was performed because of unsuccessful ERCP. With a curved linear array <b>echoendoscope,</b> a 7. 2 &#x 02009;F catheter {{was placed in the}} PD. Laboratory data showed improvement in a few days and revealed disappearance of the fluid collection. Ten days after ESPD, a 7 &#x 02009;F stent was placed in the PD via the puncture tract across the papilla of Vater followed by transpapillary replacement with a 10 &#x 02009;F stent. CT showed a reduction in diameter of the PD and disappearance of the pseudocyst. ESPD is a feasible and useful procedure in selected patients with chronic pancreatitis showing stenosis of the main PD when transpapillary approach is impossible...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEndoscopic {{retrograde}} cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) {{may fail}} in 10 – 15 % of cases. These patients are usually referred for percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) or surgical interventions. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) offers an alternative route {{of access to}} the biliary tree. Using the curved linear array <b>echoendoscope,</b> access to the bile duct is possible under real-time EUS guidance. The route of access is anterograde, in contrast to the retrograde approach of ERCP. We have coined the term EUS-guided anterograde cholangiopancreatography (EACP) to cover the spectrum of EUS-guided techniques for accessing and draining the bile and pancreatic ducts. The possible approaches and techniques are reviewed in this paper. The literature supports the feasibility of EACP for malignant and benign biliary obstruction, with high success rates and improving safety profile with regard to significant complications. Tools are being designed for EUS-guided applications to enable safer transenteric access and drainage...|$|E
40|$|Endoscopic {{ultrasonography}} (EUS) {{represents the}} combination of endoscopy and intraluminal ultrasonography. This allows use of a high-frequency transducer (5 - 20 MHz) that, due to the short distance to the target lesion, provides ultrasonographic images of higher resolution than those obtained from other imaging modalities, including multiple-detector-row-computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography. EUS is now a widely accepted modality for diagnosing pancreatic diseases. However, the most important limitation of EUS has been the lack of specificity in differentiating between benign and malignant changes. In 1992, EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) of lesions in the pancreas head was introduced into clinical practice, using a curved linear-array <b>echoendoscope.</b> Since then, EUS has evolved from EUS imaging to EUS-FNA and wider applications. Interventional EUS for pancreatic cancer includes EUS-FNA, EUS-guided fine needle injection, EUS-guided biliary drainage and anastomosis, EUS-guided celiac neurolysis, radiofrequency ablation, brachytherapy, and delivery {{of a growing number}} of anti-tumor agents. This review focuses on interventional EUS, including EUS-FNA and therapeutic EUS for pancreatic cancer...|$|E
40|$|Giant esophageal and hypopharyngeal polyps are benign tumors rarely {{encountered}} in clinical practice. In most cases, {{they are completely}} asymptomatic; however, despite the rarity of these tumors, interest in giant esophageal polyps derives from their degree of growth (characterized by slow growth into the esophageal lumen) and their mobility. In fact, if regurgitation occurs, they can ascend into the oral cavity and be aspirated into the airways, with potentially lethal consequences. The removal of these giant polyps is recommended. An adequate preoperative evaluation to identify the correct origin of the stalk is mandatory for a successful endoscopic or surgical treatment. A 60 -year-old man was admitted to our hospital for anemia. The patient underwent gastroscopy, contrast computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasound. At {{the conclusion of the}} procedure, during the extraction of the <b>echoendoscope,</b> the patient began retching and regurgitated the polyp, without experiencing respiratory distress. The patient underwent a left cervicotomy and polyp dissection via a pharyngotomy...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Endoscopic {{drainage}} of pancreatic pseudocysts and abscesses {{has been}} shown to be an effective treatment modality. A major determinant for successful cyst resolution is the insertion of multiple endoprostheses and/or placement of a nasocystic drain, which require repeated entries of a catheter into the pseudocyst to reintroduce the guidewire. OBJECTIVE: We describe a novel and easy technique to prevent the need for repeated access into the pseudocyst, thereby facilitating the placement of multiple endoprostheses by using a commercially available guiding system for stent introduction. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Academic Medical Center, The Netherlands. PATIENTS: Eight consecutive patients with symptomatic pancreatic pseudocysts after acute pancreatitis. INTERVENTIONS: Intracystic wire exchange for the insertion of multiple stents in endoscopic treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts by using an <b>echoendoscope.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Feasibility of intracystic wire exchange and complications. RESULTS: No guidewire access to the pseudocyst was lost. The procedure was well tolerated by the patients. Complete pseudocyst resolution was established in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: The endoscopic appliance of multiple stents becomes easier when using intracystic wire exchange for transgastric pancreatic pseudocyst drainag...|$|E
40|$|Background. Endoscopic-Ultrasonography- (EUS-) guided {{puncture}} {{and drainage}} of pancreatic pseudocyst is currently {{one of the}} most widely accepted nonsurgical treatments. To date, this technique has only been used for pancreatic pseudocysts adhesive to the gastric wall. This study introduces the technique of EUS-guided pseudocyst drainage and additional EUS-guided peritoneal drainage for the ruptured pseudocyst. Methods. Transmural puncture and drainage of the cyst were performed with a 19 [*]G needle, cystotome, and 10 [*]Fr endoprosthesis. Intraperitoneal drainage was performed with a nasobiliary catheter when rupture of pseudocyst occurred. The entire procedure was guided by the <b>echoendoscope.</b> Results. A total of 21 patients, 8 men and 13 women, with a mean age of 36 years, were included in this prospective study. All of the pseudocysts were successfully drained by EUS. Peritoneal drainage was uneventfully performed in 4 patients. There were no severe complications. Complete pseudocyst resolution was established in all patients. Conclusion. The technique of EUS-guided transmural puncture and drainage, when combined with abdominal cavity drainage by a nasobiliary catheter, allows successful endoscopic management of pancreatic pseudocysts without adherence to gastric wall...|$|E
