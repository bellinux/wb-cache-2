5|$|Black Moshannon Lake and the bogs of the Natural Area are <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the IBA. They {{serve as}} a {{stopover}} for migratory waterfowl and shorebirds. Waterfowl observed at the park include pied-billed and Slavonian grebes, common loon, American black duck, ruddy duck, blue-winged and green-winged teal, tundra swan, long-tailed duck, hooded and red-breasted merganser, greater and lesser scaup, northern pintail, bufflehead, American wigeon, and northern shoveler.|$|E
5|$|Weber's {{thinking}} was {{strongly influenced by}} German idealism and particularly by neo-Kantianism, {{to which he had}} been exposed through Heinrich Rickert, his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg. <b>Especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Weber's work is the neo-Kantian belief that reality is essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from {{the way in which the}} human mind focuses its attention on certain aspects of reality and organises the resulting perceptions. Weber's opinions regarding the methodology of the social sciences show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist Georg Simmel.|$|E
5|$|Fire {{suppression}} {{encouraged the}} growth of young coniferous trees, such as ponderosa pine and incense cedar; adult conifers create enough shade to inhibit {{the growth of}} young black oak trees. By the 20thcentury, fire suppression and the lowering of water tables by draining swamps led {{to the establishment of}} dense conifer forests where mixed and open conifer-oak woodlands had previously grown. Fire suppression polices have been replaced by a fire management program which includes the annual use of prescribed fires. Fire is <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the giant sequoia groves, whose seeds cannot germinate without fire-touched soil.|$|E

50|$|From the Roman period, {{traces of}} small {{nucleated}} settlements {{are found in}} the valley and the surrounding territory, including <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> routes <b>to</b> Akragas. Christian tombs, dating to the 5th century AD have been found, near the prehistoric caves.|$|R
5|$|The native Mesolithic {{populations were}} slow in {{gradually}} assimilating the agricultural way of life, beginning {{with just the}} use of ceramics. It took a thousand years into the Neolithic period before they adopted animal husbandry (which became <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> them) and plant cultivation to any appreciable degree. When they eventually developed interest in the more fertile areas utilized by the late Danubian cultures, they became the threat that compelled the Danubian farmers to fortify their settlements. The native post-Mesolithic groups expanded beyond the traditional Danubian areas of agricultural development, moving also into ecologically less favorable environments, which included utilization of sandy soils.|$|E
5|$|The priory's lands around Guisborough were {{a source}} of wealth for the Chaloners. Around 1595, Sir Thomas Chaloner's son, also called Thomas, {{established}} England's first alum works at Belman Bank south of the town. Alum was an important product {{with a variety of}} industrial uses. It was <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the cloth industry as a mordant (a substance used to fix dyes on cloth). The supply of alum was controlled by a cartel controlled by the Papal States and Spain which were in conflict with England and exercised a virtual monopoly on the provision of alum to Christian Europe, as the import of cheaper Turkish alum was banned by Pope Paul II in the mid-15th century. Chaloner visited the Pope's alum works at Tolfa near Rome and noticed the soil and vegetation around them resembled those of his estate at Guisborough. On his return he established alum works at Belman Bank with the aid of workmen smuggled from Rome, earning him a papal excommunication. John Walker Ord casts doubt on the story, noting an account published a few decades afterwards stated that the workmen came from France and does not mention Chaloner's travels in Italy.|$|E

Reed stuck closely to the facts in the case, quoting at length from the statute, regulations and agency order.|$|E
25|$|The International Convention for the High Seas Fisheries of the North Pacific Ocean was <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Japan, as {{it helped}} re-establish the Japanese fishing fleet {{grounded}} by the Allied Occupation and provided access to fishing grounds northeast of Hokkaido in the North Pacific. In addition to re-mobilizing the Japanese fishing fleet, however, the Convention established a western abstention line—the westernmost limit the Japanese fleet could {{fish in the}} North Pacific Ocean.|$|E
25|$|While {{flicking}} is used {{to higher}} notes, the whisper key is used for lower notes. From the A right below middle C and lower, the whisper key is pressed with the left thumb and held {{for the duration of}} the note. This prevents cracking, as low notes can sometimes crack into a higher octave. Both flicking and using the whisper key is <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> ensure notes speak properly during slurring between high and low registers.|$|E

25|$|Rama is <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Vaishnavism. He is {{the central}} figure of the ancient Hindu epic Ramayana, a text {{historically}} popular in the South Asian and Southeast Asian cultures. His ancient legends have attracted bhasya (commentaries) and extensive secondary literature and inspired performance arts. Two such texts, for example, are the Adhyatma Ramayana – a spiritual and theological treatise considered foundational by Ramanandi monasteries, and the Ramcharitmanas – a popular treatise that inspires thousands of Ramlila festival performances during autumn every year in India.|$|E
25|$|For {{simulating}} {{molecules in}} a solvent, a choice {{should be made}} between explicit and implicit solvent. Explicit solvent particles (such as the TIP3P, SPC/E and SPC-f water models) must be calculated expensively by the force field, while implicit solvents use a mean-field approach. Using an explicit solvent is computationally expensive, requiring inclusion of roughly ten times more particles in the simulation. But the granularity and viscosity of explicit solvent is essential to reproduce certain properties of the solute molecules. This is <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> reproduce chemical kinetics.|$|E

25|$|In Capitalism and Freedom (1962), Friedman further {{developed}} Friedrich Hayek's {{argument that}} economic freedom, while itself {{an extremely important}} component of total freedom, is also {{a necessary condition for}} political freedom. He commented that centralized control of economic activities was always accompanied with political repression. In his view, voluntary character of all transactions in a free market economy and wide diversity that it permits are fundamental threats to repressive political leaders and greatly diminish power to coerce. Through elimination of centralized control of economic activities, economic power is separated from political power, and the one can serve as counterbalance to the other. Friedman feels that competitive capitalism is <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> minority groups, since impersonal market forces protect people from discrimination in their economic activities for reasons unrelated to their productivity.|$|E
25|$|In Ecuador the Day of the Dead is {{observed}} {{to some extent}} by all parts of society, though it is <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the indigenous Kichwa peoples, who make up an estimated quarter of the population. Indigena families gather together in the community cemetery with offerings of food for a day-long remembrance of their ancestors and lost loved ones. Ceremonial foods include colada morada, a spiced fruit porridge that derives its deep purple color from the Andean blackberry and purple maize. This is typically consumed with guagua de pan, a bread shaped like a swaddled infant, though variations include many pigs—the latter being traditional {{to the city of}} Loja. The bread, which is wheat flour-based today, but was made with masa in the pre-Columbian era, can be made savory with cheese inside or sweet with a filling of guava paste. These traditions have permeated mainstream society, as well, where food establishments add both colada morada and gaugua de pan to their menus for the season. Many non-indigenous Ecuadorians visit the graves of the deceased, cleaning and bringing flowers, or preparing the traditional foods, too.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} factors that promote {{circular}} migration. Modern forms of transport and communication, increased social networks, {{and the growth}} of international corporations all contribute to the growing phenomena. Advances in transportation have reduced the time and money necessary to travel between locations, making it easier for migrants to return home more frequently {{and in the case of}} an emergency. New methods of communication facilitate closer connections with the migrants’ homes than before. Border-crossing social networks are <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the success of migrants. Through these networks, migrants are able to help each other by providing information about where to go, the best way to get jobs, where to live, etc., helping them to overcome many of the costs and barriers of entry. Furthermore, through these social networks, workers are able to keep up with families, economic activities, political interests, and individual cultures. This also contributes to the self-perpetuating nature of circular migration. With each return visit, migrants learn more about work, housing, and the process of migration itself. These social relationships and experiences, referred to as “migration-specific capital”, lower the risk and costs of moving and improve the changes of success.|$|E
