5|$|Once {{he began}} to play football, as a junior, he {{achieved}} instant success as a running back, running 65 {{yards for a touchdown}} on his first high school carry. At , he was not especially large, but his speed and strength {{made him one of the}} team's featured players. John J. Jefferson High School was integrated with neighboring Columbia High School that year; Payton and his teammates were upset that their head coach, Charles L. Boston, had become an assistant and Payton boycotted some of the spring practices in protest, but returned during the fall season. He then earned statewide honors as a member of Mississippi's all-state team, leading Columbia to an unexpected 8–2 season. His performance helped ease the local tensions surrounding desegregation. Tommy Davis, Columbia’s football coach, claimed that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> count on Payton when the team needed to score. Payton’s statistics proved that was no exaggeration: he scored in every game during his junior and senior years. He was named to the all-conference team two years in a row. Payton also led the Little Dixie Conference in scoring his senior year and made the all-state team. In addition to excelling at football, Payton averaged 18 points a game for Columbia’s basketball team, leaped three-quarters of an inch short of 23 feet in the long jump, played baseball, and continued to drum in the school band.|$|E
25|$|Outside his {{official}} duties, McCormick began the Arizona Miner with a Ramage press {{he had brought}} with him. The newspaper's first edition was printed on March 9, 1864, at Fort Whipple and began regular operations in Prescott on June 22, 1864. McCormick's control of the newspaper aided his political career by ensuring <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> receive favorable press coverage. The paper also provided a forum for McCormick to share his thoughts {{with the people of}} Arizona. In 1868, following the territorial capital's move to Tucson, McCormick sold his property in Prescott and purchased an interest in the Weekly Arizonian. His association with the Arizonian continued till October 1, 1870, when the paper's editor withdrew support for McCormick. McCormick's response was to repossess the paper's printing press and begin a new newspaper, the Arizona Citizen, on October 15, 1870.|$|E

The British were reading their coded messages and sailed to intercept them with a larger force of British battlecruisers.

500|$|Still expecting von Kluge to {{withdraw}} his {{forces from the}} tightening Allied noose, Montgomery had for some time been planning a [...] "long envelopment", by which the British and Canadians would pivot left from Falaise toward the River Seine while the US Third Army blocked the escape route between the Seine and the Loire, trapping all surviving German forces in western France. In a telephone conversation on 8 August, the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, recommended an American proposal for a shorter envelopment at Argentan. Montgomery and Patton had misgivings; if the Allies did not take Argentan, Alençon and Falaise quickly, many Germans might escape. Believing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> fall back on the original plan if necessary, Montgomery accepted the wishes of Bradley as {{the man on the}} spot, and the proposal was adopted.|$|E

50|$|Qe6 is {{a futile}} attempt to unpin the knight (allowing it {{to defend the}} rook) and offer a queen trade, to take some {{pressure}} {{out of the white}} attack.

2500|$|As King's term wore on, the Progressives {{gradually}} weakened. Their {{effective and}} passionate leader, Thomas Crerar, resigned {{to return to}} his grain business, and was replaced by the more placid Robert Forke. Socialist reformer J.S. Woodsworth gradually gained influence and power, and King was able to reach an accommodation with him on policy matters. In any event, the Progressive caucus lacked the party discipline that was traditionally enforced by the Liberals and Conservatives. The Progressives had campaigned on a promise that their MP's [...] would represent their constituents first. King used this to his advantage, as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> count on at least a handful of Progressive MP's to shore up his near-majority position for any crucial vote.|$|E
2500|$|The Manchester Guardian {{wrote of}} Bourchier, [...] "A certain coarseness, a certain bluff geniality {{and with it}} a certain slyness, were all part of his {{composition}} as a stage personality, [...] {{in spite of his}} great vitality it was not in violent or exuberant parts that he shone... his artistic merit was that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> get his best effects very quietly." [...] The Times said, [...] "Never a great actor, he was nevertheless always a conspicuous figure in the theatrical world. [...] He brought to his work an enthusiasm for the stage which gave to performances not artistically distinguished a curious effect of personal distinction.... Sometimes his interpretations seemed to be misguided and his methods extravagantly theatrical, but here at least was an actor who was never colourless and, therefore, seldom dull." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{serving his}} time on Titan, Rico {{returned}} to Mega-City One seeking revenge on Joe. Confronting him at his home, Rico challenged him to a duel to settle their differences, knowing that with his superior skills <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> outdraw his brother. However he had grown used to the weaker gravity of Titan after his twenty years there. This slowed him down by a split second and allowed Joe to shoot him dead. Carrying his brother's lifeless body out into the street, Joe declined a paramedic's offer of assistance, allowing the writer, Pat Mills, to conclude the story with {{a line from the}} Hollies song, [...] "He ain't heavy - he's my brother!" [...] (In the retelling, Rico brings up the violence and hypocrisy of Justice Department as well as what he's gone through on Titan) ...|$|E
60|$|With {{the lifting}} of his great anxiety, he had got back to that {{lightness}} which was most like him, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>always</b> conceal from Lottie herself that he regarded her as a joke.

60|$|Well! {{all these}} {{pleasant}} little occurrences could happen yet. M. de Stainville was {{quite sure that}} on his return from Le Havre <b>he</b> <b>could</b> provoke the Englishman to fight.

50|$|After he left school, Bob Nolan drifted {{around the}} country, finding work where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> and <b>always</b> writing songs. He took a {{lifeguard}} job in Los Angeles in 1929.

2500|$|As a child, Nimoy took {{miscellaneous}} jobs {{to supplement}} his family's income, including selling newspapers and greeting cards, shining shoes, or setting up chairs in theaters, {{and when he}} got older, selling vacuum cleaners. He also began acting at the age of eight in a children's and neighborhood theater. His parents wanted him to attend college and pursue a stable career, or even learn to play the accordion, so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> make a living, but his grandfather encouraged him to do what he then wanted to do most, to become an actor. Nimoy also realized he had an aptitude for singing, which he developed while a member of his synagogue's choir. His singing during his bar mitzvah at age 13 was so good that he was asked to repeat his performance the following week at another synagogue. [...] "He is still the only man I know whose voice was two bar mitzvahs good!," [...] said William Shatner.|$|E

5000|$|Less {{than four}} feet tall as a fully {{developed}} adult, Roventini {{was working as}} a bellboy at the New Yorker Hotel in 1933 when he was discovered by an advertising mogul, who had him perform a page, issuing a [...] "Call for Philip Morris". <b>He</b> reportedly <b>could</b> <b>always</b> vocalize a perfect B-flat tone as he repeated those words, literally over a million times during his career, according to his own estimate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we fellows {{were talking}} over the late {{interesting}} case of circumstantial evidence," [...] said Tommy, quoting at random from a speech Franz had {{made at the}} club, [...] "and I proposed giving Dan something {{to make up for}} our suspecting him, to show our respect, and so on, you know something handsome and useful, that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> keep <b>always</b> and be proud of.

6000|$|... "Well, {{because he}} wears such curious-colored clothes. No {{criminal}} would ever wear such clothes. He could never pass unnoticed anywhere; and being {{probably the only}} person in the world who dressed that way, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> be detected." ...|$|E
60|$|Saton {{considered}} for a moment. After all, perhaps it would pay him best to be straightforward with this girl. He would tell her the truth. If she were disagreeable about it, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> swear {{that he had been}} joking.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Beckendorff {{was soon}} out of sight, and after {{lingering}} half-an-hour {{in the vicinity}} of the blue passion-flower, the Prince proposed to Vivian that they should quit the spot.

Surely <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>always</b> have been this frivolous creature!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The Los Angeles Times {{reported}} that it was Summerland's custom [...] "whenever a circus came to town to buy 200 tickets and take all the poor boys <b>he</b> <b>could</b> find. <b>He</b> <b>always</b> went along himself {{to see that they}} got their popcorn, peanuts and red lemonade." ...|$|R
5000|$|He continued: My father, like Ives, {{was drawn}} to the contemplative {{philosophy}} of the New England trancendentalists, particularly Thoreau, whose modesty, economy and fierce independence he admired, even when <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>always</b> emulate it. Both fathers seem to have shared a certain dreaminess that expressed itself in speculating about art and, in the case of Carl Adams, took the form of several failed attempts to establish himself as a painter after an some earlier experience playing jazz clarinet and saxophone.|$|R
60|$|He {{had done}} very well with his fish so far, and prices for trout at the Lake went up every day. Dan was an enterprising boy, and a general {{favourite}} with the hotel owners. They knew that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>always</b> be depended on.|$|E

60|$|This {{was more}} than even a bear <b>could</b> bear. <b>He</b> rushed savagely about the cavern, {{growling}} hideously, dashing the sledge about {{as if it had}} been a mere toy, and doing all the mischief <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> yet <b>always</b> avoiding the axe with particular care--thus showing that polar bears, not less than men, are quite awake to personal danger, even when supposed to be blind with rage! At last he lay down to recover himself, and lick his bloody nose and paw.|$|R
50|$|As {{the letter}} hints, Honywood's control {{was not quite}} {{absolute}} and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>always</b> secure both seats for his candidates. The 1792 ruling on the franchise, moving the vote from the burgage holders to all the householders paying scot and lot, shifted {{the balance of power}} over to the Duke of Norfolk (who owned most of the properties that were not classed as ancient houses), and he subsequently bought out Honywood's interest. But he was careful to secure his investment by financing many improvements in the town.|$|R
