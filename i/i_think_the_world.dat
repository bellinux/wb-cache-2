500|$|Ferdinando {{rejected}} it outright with the fullest support of Louis XIV, his great-uncle. Cosimo's eyes now fell upon Violente of Bavaria. Choosing her would strengthen ties between France—where Violente's sister was the dauphine—and Bavaria. There {{was only one}} obstacle in the way, Ferdinando II, Cosimo's father, impartially advised Violente's father, Ferdinand Maria, to invest a huge sum into a bank. Soon after the Elector deposited the sum, the bank collapsed. Ferdinand Maria still had sore feelings; Cosimo consented to the reduction of her dowry accordingly to reimburse the Elector. Ferdinando was unimpressed with his wife. Violente, however, electrified the Grand Duke. He wrote, [...] "I have never known, nor do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> can produce, a disposition so perfect..." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} acquire Violante Beatrice's {{hand for the}} Grand Prince, Cosimo was obliged to reimburse Ferdinand Maria's son Maximilian II. With this {{obstacle}} surmounted, the marriage contract was signed on 24 May 1688, granting Violante Beatrice a dowry of 400,000 thalers in cash and the same amount in jewellery. She married the Grand Prince by proxy in Munich on 21 November 1688 and was married in person on 9 January 1689. The wedding reception {{was held at the}} Palazzo Medici Riccardi in Florence. The new Grand Princess was instantly enamoured with the bridegroom, {{in spite of the fact}} he loathed her. Cosimo III, however, could not find fault in his daughter-in-law, saying, [...] "I have never known, nor do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> can produce, a disposition so perfect".|$|E
500|$|Many {{felt the}} tone of the album was millennial or futuristic, anticipating {{cultural}} and political trends. According to The A.V. Club writer Steven Hyden in the feature [...] "Whatever Happened to Alternative Nation", [...] "Radiohead appeared to be ahead of the curve, forecasting the paranoia, media-driven insanity, and omnipresent sense of impending doom that's subsequently come to characterise everyday life in the 21st century." [...] In 1000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die, Tom Moon described OK Computer as a [...] "prescient... dystopian essay on the darker implications of technology... oozing [...] a vague sense of dread, and a touch of Big Brother foreboding that bears strong resemblance to the constant disquiet of life on Security Level Orange, post-9/11." [...] Chris Martin of Coldplay remarked that, [...] "It would {{be interesting to see how}} the world would be different if Dick Cheney really listened to Radiohead's OK Computer. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> would probably improve. That album is fucking brilliant. It changed my life, so why wouldn't it change his?" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Bossy" [...] {{was written}} by Shaffer Smith, known by his stage name Ne-Yo, while {{additional}} writing and song production was done by Stargate members Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen. In the beginning of May 2008, a clip of the song leaked on YouTube. As a result, Universal Motown released the full song to media outlets on May 7, 2008. In an interview with Billboard, Ne-Yo revealed that he was approached by the label to write a song for Lohan: [...] "I gotta admit, we were like ... Lindsay Lohan?' I mean, I've written for Beyoncé, Mary J. Blige, Rihanna, Celine Dion and ... Lindsay Lohan? But I will say this; we gave her a quality record and she did a ridiculously fabulous job. I was so shocked I had to call her and apologize for what I was thinking because she did so good. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> is gonna be surprised." [...] In an interview with People Magazine, he revealed the song [...] "it's basically about a woman being strong enough to get what she wants when she wants it. In this case, 'Bossy' is a term that describes confidence and power." [...] "Bossy" [...] was digitally released on May 27, 2008, and it was set to appear on Lohan's third studio album.|$|E

2500|$|Sugizo in the {{interview}} said that [...] "there are secrets held by a small elite who control the world... We spend our lives without ever being aware of the truth that is hidden from us", and so through the song [...] "Tell Me Why You Hide The Truth?" [...] meant [...] "We have to liberate freedom and rebuild it by ourselves. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> {{is in need of}} a revolution. To know what to believe, to know what's really going on in this world we have to take the initiative. That's the sort of signal I'm trying to send". Also added [...] "The thing I seriously want to do the most is make society, the whole world, clean. That's the duty we must fulfill for the next generation".|$|E

2500|$|Israelis {{marked the}} 40th {{anniversary of the}} Munich {{massacre}} in London, during which prayers were read for the 11 murdered Israelis, wreaths were laid, and a plaque was unveiled approximately four miles from the Olympic Stadium. London Mayor Boris Johnson attended the event, and recalled watching the massacre in 1972 unfold when he was 8 years old. Johnson said, “What sticks in my mind is that sense of sacrilege {{and a feeling of}} horror that the world's greatest sporting event should suffer such an attack, and that an attack should be mounted against people who had been training for what should have been the greatest event in their lives. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> watched with a sense of numb disbelief as those events unfolded because sport should transcend politics." [...] In addition, Israeli TV commentators held an informal 30-second silence during the Olympics opening ceremony.|$|E
