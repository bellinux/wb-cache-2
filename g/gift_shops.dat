The <b>Gift</b> <b>Shop</b> then uses the cash receipts to purchase inventory items for resale, supplies, shipping, and other related services expenses. The Senate Disbursing Office maintains the money and makes payments on behalf of the Senate <b>Gift</b> <b>Shop</b> Revolving Fund. Salaries and benefits of Senate employees who work in the <b>Gift</b> <b>Shop</b> are not paid from the revolving fund; rather, they are paid from the "Salaries, Officers, and Employees" appropriation account of the Senate.
