25|$|Cytotoxic T cells (also {{known as}} TC, <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell,</b> or {{cytotoxic}} T-lymphocyte (CTL)) are a sub-group of T cells that induce {{the death of}} cells that are infected with viruses (and other pathogens), or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional.|$|E
25|$|Second {{generation}} vaccines {{were developed}} to reduce the risks from live vaccines. These are subunit vaccines, consisting of specific protein antigens (such as tetanus or diphtheria toxoid) or recombinant protein components (such as the hepatitis B surface antigen). They can generate TH and antibody responses, but not <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> responses.|$|E
25|$|First {{generation}} vaccines are whole-organism vaccines – either {{live and}} weakened, or killed forms. Live, attenuated vaccines, such as smallpox and polio vaccines, {{are able to}} induce killer T-cell (TC or CTL) responses, helper T-cell (TH) responses and antibody immunity. However, attenuated forms of a pathogen can convert to a dangerous form and may cause disease in immunocompromised vaccine recipients (such as those with AIDS). While killed vaccines do not have this risk, they cannot generate specific <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> responses and may not work at all for some diseases.|$|E
2500|$|Each {{of these}} {{different}} cell types are expressed in cluster of differentiation 1 molecules (CD1). There are 5 subtypes of CD1 molecules that range from a through e. The a through d subtypes are capable of binding to sulfatide. CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c subtypes present lipid antigens to <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> while CD1d cells present lipids, glycolipids, and lipoproteins to Natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> CD1 a through c <b>cell</b> subtypes initiate <b>T</b> helper type 1 and type 2 responses, and they facilitate sulfatide loading {{onto the surface of}} the cells. There are two types of cell subtypes that interact with CD1d cells: Type 1 Natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> and Type 2 Natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> Type 2 Natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> are able to recognize sulfatide/ CD1d tetramers, and as a result, they are activated by different tissues specific forms of sulfatide. [...] Type 2 Natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> that react with sulfatide help aid in protection from autoimmune disease and ischemic reperfusion. They are capable of such protection because the Type 1 Natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> can be regulated by Type 2 Natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> that react with sulfatide by altering how the dendritic cells function.|$|R

40|$|Background: {{the number}} of type 2 helper CD 4 + <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> is {{increased}} in the airways of persons with asthma. Whether {{the majority of these}} cells are class II major-histocompatibility-complex-restricted cells or are among the recently identified CD 1 d-restricted invariant natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> is a matter of controversy. We studied the frequency of invariant natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in the airways of subjects with mild or moderately severe asthma to investigate the possibility of an association between {{the number of}} invariant natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in the airway and disease severity. We also studied whether an increased number of these cells is a feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Methods: we enumerated invariant natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> by flow cytometry with the use of CD 1 d tetramers loaded with alpha-galactosylceramide and antibodies specific to the invariant natural killer T-cell receptor in samples of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid, induced sputum, and bronchial-biopsy specimens obtained from subjects with mild or moderately severe asthma, subjects with COPD, and healthy control subjects. Real-time polymerase-chain-reaction analysis was performed on bronchoalveolar-lavage cells for evidence of gene expression of the invariant natural killer T-cell receptor. Results: fewer than 2 % of the <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> obtained from all subjects on airway biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage, and sputum induction were invariant natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> with no significant differences among the three groups of subjects. No expression of messenger RNA for the invariant natural killer T-cell-receptor domains Valpha 24 and Vbeta 11 was detected in bronchoalveolar-lavage cells from subjects with asthma. Conclusions: invariant natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> are found in low numbers in the airways of subjects with asthma, subjects with COPD, and controls...|$|R
500|$|Both B {{cells and}} T cells carry {{receptor}} molecules that recognize specific targets. T cells recognize a [...] "non-self" [...] target, {{such as a}} pathogen, only after antigens (small fragments of the pathogen) have been processed and presented in combination with a [...] "self" [...] receptor called a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. There are two major subtypes of T cells: the <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> and the helper T cell. In addition there are regulatory T cells which [...] {{have a role in}} modulating immune response. Killer T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class I MHC molecules, while helper T cells and regulatory T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class II MHC molecules. These two mechanisms of antigen presentation reflect the different roles of the two types of T cell. A third, minor subtype are the γδ T cells that recognize intact antigens that are not bound to MHC receptors.|$|E

50|$|Natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> (NKT) <b>cells</b> are a {{heterogeneous}} group of <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> that share properties of both <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> and natural <b>killer</b> cells.

When a <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> makes contact with a target cell, the killer cell attaches and spreads over the dangerous target. The killer cell then uses special chemicals housed in vesicles (red) to deliver the killing blow. This event has thus been nicknamed “the kiss of death”. After the target cell is killed, the killer T cells move on to find the next victim.|$|E

APOE is produced by macrophages and APOE secretion {{has been shown to be}} restricted to classical monocytes in PBMC, and the secretion of APOE by monocytes is down regulated by inflammatory cytokines and upregulated by TGF-beta.|$|E
50|$|As a cell is {{indicated}} by the prefix cyto, a cytotoxic influence destroys the <b>cell.</b> Alloreactive <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> also called cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), have CD8 receptors that dock to the transplanted tissue's MHC class I molecules,which display the donor's self peptides. (In the living donor, such presentation of self antigens helped maintain self tolerance.) Thereupon, the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptors (TCRs) of the <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> recognize their matching epitope, and trigger the target cell's programmed cell death by apoptosis.|$|R

50|$|Cytotoxic T cells (also {{known as}} Tc, <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell,</b> or {{cytotoxic}} T-lymphocyte (CTL)) express CD8 coreceptor are {{a population of}} T cells that are specialised for inducing programmed cell death of other cells. Cytotoxic T cells regularly patrol all body cells to maintain the organismal homeostasis. Whenever they encounter signs of disease, caused for example {{by the presence of}} viruses or intracellular bacteria or a transformed tumor cell, they initiate processes to destroy the potentially harmful cell. All nucleated cells in the body (along with platelets) display class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I molecules). Antigens generated endogenously within these cells are bound to MHC-I molecules and presented on the cell surface. This antigen presentation pathway enables the immune system to detect transformed or infected cells displaying peptides from modified-self (mutated) or foreign proteins.|$|E

5|$|Helper <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> express <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptors (TCR) that {{recognize}} antigen {{bound to}} Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also {{recognized by the}} helper cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> (e.g., Lck) {{that are responsible for}} the <b>T</b> <b>cell's</b> activation. Helper <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> meaning many receptors (around 200–300) on the helper <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper <b>cell,</b> while <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Helper <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. The activation of a resting helper <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by helper <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> In addition, helper <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the <b>T</b> <b>cell's</b> surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.|$|R
50|$|The {{first phase}} of {{elimination}} involves the initiation of an antitumor immune response. Cells of the innate immune system recognize {{the presence of a}} growing tumor which has undergone stromal remodeling, causing local tissue damage. This is followed by the induction of inflammatory signals which is essential for recruiting cells of the innate immune system (e.g. natural <b>killer</b> <b>cells,</b> natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> macrophages and dendritic cells) to the tumor site. During this phase, the infiltrating lymphocytes such as the natural killer <b>cells</b> and natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> are stimulated to produce IFN-gamma.|$|R
5|$|The main {{response}} {{of the immune system}} to tumors is to destroy the abnormal <b>cells</b> using <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> sometimes with the assistance of helper <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> Tumor antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules in a similar way to viral antigens. This allows <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> to recognize the tumor cell as abnormal. NK cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way, especially if the tumor cells have fewer MHC class I molecules on their surface than normal; this is a common phenomenon with tumors. Sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the complement system.|$|R

There she took interest dysregulation in autoimmune diseases and, in her fourth year at Harvard, discovered the protein known as Nk1.1(see natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell),</b> which soon became widely recognized across the field of immunology. For this discovery, Glimcher {{became the first woman}} to receive the Soma Weiss Award, an honor her father had received 26 years earlier. During this time, Glimcher worked with mentor Bill Paul, who strongly encouraged her to continue her research independently after completing medical school.During her second year of residency, Glimcher realized why she felt so drawn to this area of research. “What always fascinated me was not so much treating patients with disease, but figuring out why they had the disease,” says Glimcher.Glimcher currently heads her own lab for research in immunology. She has been interested in studying the ties between ER stress system in neurons and immune function and neuro-degeneration. Her past work has involved regulation of immune function and has shifted towards osteobiology with a focus on the bone disease osteoporosis. Her Harvard lab has a three-year contract with Merck for the drug Fosamax, a treatment for osteoporosis. Glimcher’s more current research looks to answer the question, “how does the immune system and the ER stress system in neurons impact neurodegenerative diseases?”.|$|E
40|$|Invariant natural killer T {{cells have}} a {{distinct}} developmental pathway from conventional ab Tcells.

In CD 4 -cre NKAP conditional knockout mice, invariant natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> development is blocked at the double-positive stage. This cell-intrinsic block is not due to decreased survival or failure to rearrange the invariant Va 14 -Ja 18 T cell receptor-a chain, but is rescued by overexpression of a rec-Va 14 -Ja 18 transgene at the double-positive stage, thus defining a role for NKAP in selection into the invariant natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> lineage. Importantly, deletion of the NKAP-associated protein histone deacetylase 3 causes a similar block in the invariant natural killer Tcell development, indicating that NKAP and histone deacetylase 3 functionally interact to control invariant natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> development...|$|E

40|$|Despite much recent {{interest}} and effort, {{the role played}} by major histocompatibility complex products in the regulation of T-cell responses remains perplexing. In 1972 it was observed that mouse T and B cells would only cooperate in an antibody reponse if they shared certain regions of H- 2 (1). Subsequently, H- 2 gene products were also found to be involved in cytotoxic T-cell reactions, and it was postulated that the <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> must bear H- 2 molecules in common with those of its target in order to effect lysis (2 - 6). Later studies with radiation chimeras showed {{that this is not the}} case, but that the H- 2 region must be shared between the cells used to stimulate the response and the targets; a <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> that was itself H- 2 type A, after having grown up in an (A × B) F 1 could be stimulated to lyse H- 2 type B virus-infected or trinitrophenyl-modified targets (7 - 9). Such chimeras were also found to contain A type helper T cells which can cooperate with B type B cells (10). It was then postulated that T-cell precursors "learn " to recognize the H- 2 type of the host as self (11). Recent evidence shows that the host H- 2 type of a chimera doe...|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} {{basis for}} the T cell response to glycolipid antigens (Ags) remains poorly understood. T lymphocytes autoreactive for mouse CD 1 (mCD 1. 1) or reactive for the glycosphingolipid αgalactosylceramide (α-GalCer) presented by mCD 1. 1 have been described previously. In this paper it is shown that mutations {{at the top of}} the α helices and in the bottom of the Ag-binding groove can disrupt both mCD 1. 1 autoreactivity and α-GalCer recognition. The locations of the positions that affect T cell responses indicate that recognition of mCD 1. 1 is not likely to be unconventional or superantigen-like. Furthermore, the effects of the bottom of the pocket mutation suggest that the autoreactive response could require an autologous ligand, and they indicate that α-GalCer binds to the groove of mCD 1. 1, most likely with the shorter 18 -carbon hydrophobic chain in the A′ pocket. Natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> hybridomas with identical T cell antigen receptor (TCR) α chains and different β chains respond differently to α-GalCer presented by mCD 1. 1 mutants. This finding indicates a role for TCR β in defining natural <b>killer</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> specificity, despite the more restricted diversity of the α chains in these cells. Overall, the data are consistent with a mode of lipoglycan recognition similar to that proposed for glycopeptides, in which the TCR α and β chains survey a surface composed of both mCD 1. 1 and the carbohydrate portion of α-GalCer...|$|E
