Although information on the approval of the law had been available since February 8, on February 15 the market took twelve minutes to react to the news and almost an hour to fully absorb it.

Owned homes are extremely different from rental units and owners are quite different from renters. The unobserved costs of home owning such as maintenance are also quite large.

This article investigates the impact of the presence of arbitrageurs in rational <b>financial</b> markets. <b>Arbitrage</b> opportunities between redundant risky assets arise endogenously in an economy populated by rational, heterogeneous investors facing restrictions on leverage and short sales. An arbitrageur, indulging in costless, riskless arbitrage is shown to alleviate the effects of these restrictions and improve the transfer of risk amongst investors. When the arbitrageur lacks market power, they always take on the largest arbitrage position possible. When the arbitrageur behaves noncompetitively, in that they take into account the price impact of their trades, they optimally limit the size of their positions due to decreasing marginal profits. In the case when the arbitrageur is subject to margin requirements and is endowed with capital from outside investors, the size of the arbitrageur’s trades and the capital needed to implement these trades are endogenously solved for in equilibrium. arbitrage; asset pricing; margin requirements; non-competitive markets; risk-sharing...|$|R

Hypothesis tests indicate that, in both crisis and precrisis years, difficult-to-fail-and-unwind (DFU) banks enjoyed substantially higher ex ante benefits than other institutions. Compared to the US sample, safety-net benefits prove significantly larger for DFU firms in Europe and bailout decisions are less driven by asset size. Introducing a proxy for differences in government susceptibility to regulatory capture helps to explain bailout decisions in Europe.
