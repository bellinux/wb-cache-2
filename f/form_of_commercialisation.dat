40|$|The essay {{deals with}} the issue of the {{unsolicited}} provisions of goods and services regulated by the article 27 of the Directive 2011 / 83 /EU and 66 -quinquies of the Italian Consumer Code. In the first section, the unsolicited provisions are examined with regard to the general contract law and the author recognises that they may be determinant to conclude the contract, when certain conditions apply. By contrast, in the second section the author takes into account the consumer law and he concludes differently. In fact, also considering the unfair trade practices, the unsolicited provisions are defined by the legislator as non-binding. Therefore, the author suggests that the unsolicited provisions are not determinant to reach the agreement even though the consumer accepts them expressively, due to their non-binding nature. Accordingly, the unsolicited provisions may be considered forbidden because of the hazardous nature of this <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>commercialisation</b> of goods and service...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>commercialisation</b> {{and consumption}} of organic produce: the box scheme. Under this system there is a medium-term (six months) or long-term (one year) contract between one or more farmers {{and a group of}} consumers, usually living close to the farms. A package (or box) containing a set amount of fresh organic produce is delivered to the consumer's home or collected through a collection centre. In order to analyse the potential of this consumption model a new methodological proposal for customer satisfaction analysis was made. Compared with other methodologies, the one suggested is different in terms of the approach to consumers' questioning. It adopts a new statistical analysis for elaborating responses. This is based on a three-stage econometric model: the first to test for consistency of data collected; the second and the third to identify product or service characteristics that influence most customer satisfaction. In this case study the method suggested identified fairly clearly that the box scheme key identifies which consumers are usually attentive...|$|E
40|$|A {{commercial}} insurance contract is deemed invalid by many Muslim scholars {{due to the}} fact that it is a mu`awada (financial exchange) contract, which is overwhelmed by prohibited elements such as gharar (uncertainty), riba (interest), and maysir (gambling). As an alternative, a Shari`acompliant insurance scheme (also known as takaful) that supposedly run on the principles of mutual co-operation was proposed by the scholars and subsequently institutionalized in the late 1970 s. Nevertheless, after more than 30 years, it appears that the majority of takaful operators currently exist worldwide were established as joint-stock or public limited companies (PLCs). As a result, it could be argued that the original concept of takaful was later overshadowed by the element of profit-making as observed in {{commercial insurance}} entities. This paper therefore sets out to examine those issues, which directly relate to this <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>commercialisation.</b> It argues that since the establishment of insurance companies based on commercial framework is impermissible, it could possibly affect the validity of present takaful arrangement. This study is mainly qualitative and relies greatly upon the documentation method. It is also based on a fieldwork method, since the business models adopted by several takaful operators in Malaysia are carefully examined. In general, it is found that the characteristics of a commercial takaful entity may not necessarily be similar to that of its conventional counterpart...|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{processes}} of agrarian change tend to favour larger-scale, more consolidated farms over smallholders, while Kenya’s agricultural policy tends to promote export oriented commercial farming. These tensions, evident {{in different ways}} over time, raise important policy questions. What are the most advantageous <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> agricultural <b>commercialisation?</b> What scale and capital intensity in agricultural investment are appropriate? These questions in turn feed into the debates about alternative pathways <b>of</b> <b>commercialisation</b> {{and the role of}} different farming ‘models’. This study aimed to engage these debates. The study was carried out in Kenya’s Meru County and examined three agricultural farming models: outgrowers, medium-scale commercial farms and a plantation.

40|$|Executive summary This report {{describes}} the commercial activities and examines the impediments and incentives facing humanities, arts {{and social sciences}} (HASS) researchers and educators at the tertiary level in Australia. It is a snapshot of who is commercialising research and how they approach this task, {{based on the findings}} of focus groups and questionnaires. Mixed throughout the report are several case studies. These stories illustrate the tangible contribution and impact of the HASS sector in cultural, social and economic terms. The processes and benefits they set out are replicated a thousand times over in the humanities, arts and social sciences in Australia. Services, such as research consultancy and contracting, were found to be the most common <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>commercialisation</b> amongst HASS researchers and practitioners, particularly in the area of government policy advice. This is supported by the finding that Australian and state government departments and agencies were the most frequently cited clients. The sciences, by contrast, tend to work on solutions to environmental and industry problems and creating new commercial opportunities. The humanities, arts and social sciences are a broad and diverse field. Different disciplines face different issues in the process of commercialisation, and there are significant variations between disciplines in the sorts of commercialisation opportunities that they can pursue and the levels of financial reward they can generate. For example, the commercial possibilities, market arrangements and standards of practice in providing economic consulting or psychological counselling services are very different from those in the creative arts. Large tenders and grants are often available for research in the social sciences and education faculties, in contrast to the smaller grants more generally offered in the arts. The benefits of commercialisation are reported as wide and varied. Commercial work enables researchers to improve their teaching and research as it gives them {{a better understanding of the}} needs of industry. It provides students with exposure to industry practices and research experience, a valued part of their training. For individuals, it can lead to a higher profile and enhanced promotional prospects, as well as improving business and negotiation skills. The economic rewards are also important: the money allows departments and faculties to fund research units, to hire staff, and to send researchers to conferences. It affords flexibility within a tightly-ordered university structure...|$|E

40|$|The {{intention}} {{with this}} thesis {{is to examine}} the preparation for <b>commercialisation</b> <b>of</b> industrial innovations. Both in the industry and in the academic perspective there is a common need for support <b>of</b> the <b>commercialisation</b> process <b>of</b> innovations, especially concerning the preparation phase. A preparation model for commercialisation has consequently been designed. The propeller <b>of</b> <b>commercialisation</b> incorporates a perspective of parallel preparation concerning the three critical aspects technology characteristics, environment scanning and preparation of the venture. Generally the model can thus contribute with a structured way of evaluation and preparation and reduce the risks by limiting the budget needed in the early phase <b>of</b> <b>commercialisation</b> through the use of subsequent steps incorporating all three critical perspectives.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this {{research}} is to examine both the practices <b>of</b> research <b>commercialisation</b> by Public-funded Research Institutes (PRIs) in Malaysia, and to determine the key factors that influence the success <b>of</b> research <b>commercialisation.</b> PRIs in Malaysia consist of public research institutions and public universities. Previous research has identified several factors that are considered to be the key determinants of the success <b>of</b> research <b>commercialisation.</b> Factors assumed to contribute to the research commercialisation success include intellectual property ownership which covers both joint and individual ownership, entrepreneurial culture, motivation and skill, researcher compensation, early stage financing, financial incentives, commercialisation culture, rewards and promotion systems, relationship between PRIs and industry, nature <b>of</b> <b>commercialisation</b> policies, type <b>of</b> <b>commercialisation</b> method determined by institution, researcher involvement and the existence <b>of</b> a <b>commercialisation</b> unit. However, prior research has not examined the full set of factors in one comprehensive study. Previous research has individually identified success factors in the context of PRIs with no attempts being made to combine all factors together. This study aimed to address this gap in the literature. This research was considered exploratory, and used a mixed methods research approach to identify those salient factors, which influenced commercialisation practices in PRIs. The data was collected in two phases. In phase one, qualitative data was collected using a semi-structured interview to identify factors considered to influence the success <b>of</b> vi <b>commercialisation</b> from the researcher point of view. In phase two, quantitative data was gathered using a survey to include a larger group of researchers to address the same research question. The total population of this study were researchers in 38 PRIs in Malaysia including public universities and public research institutes. Results from the combined studies identified that the number of research commercialised by PRIs in Malaysia was relatively low. Key determinants impacting the success <b>of</b> <b>commercialisation</b> were identified as research ownership, researcher compensation and the presence <b>of</b> a <b>commercialisation</b> unit within PRIs. These three factors identified were consistent with previous research conducted on PRIs, but in combination are presented as the most salient to commercialisation success within the Malaysian context. The study has implications for research and practice. From a practical point of view, attention to these factors by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation need to be considered particularly during the allocation of future research grants, to further increase the percentage <b>of</b> successful research <b>commercialisation</b> by PRIs in Malaysia. This thesis through its research and findings, have contributed theoretically to the existing literature on commercialisation and fill up the gap in the commercialisation literature. The listing of all key variables as carried out in this research is very crucial since most previous research focuses only on investigating one key success factor at a time in researching the key variables in the research commercialisation success. The three factors found to be significant predictors <b>of</b> <b>commercialisation</b> success suggest the need to examine factors that are unique to each institution and also to establish a common set vii of factors that can determine the research commercialisation success in any setting. The use of PRIs in this study also provides insights from the perspective of both universities and research institutions. This has lead to a greater understanding <b>of</b> <b>commercialisation</b> process in both institutions and that future researchers need to address these factors to confirm the validity of these factors in determining the success <b>of</b> research <b>commercialisation...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explain how {{professional}} and organisational identities influence auditors’ perception <b>of</b> <b>commercialisation</b> in audit firms. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a survey distributed to 3588 members of FAR, the professional institute for authorized public accountants, approved public accountants and other highly qualified professionals in the accountancy sector in Sweden, and answered by 374 of the professionals surveyed. Findings: Findings of the study indicate that commercialisation in audit firms is a three- dimensional construct consisting of market-, customer- and firm process orientations. The results of the study show that the stronger the auditors’ organisational identity, the more influence it has on auditors’ perception of all three dimensions <b>of</b> the increasing <b>commercialisation</b> <b>of</b> their firm. The increasing strength of that professional identity is shown to be reflected in the perception of their firm to be firm process oriented, while no effect is shown on the other two dimensions <b>of</b> <b>commercialisation</b> (market and customer orientations orientations).
