[124] [Sir Walter's private law-agent.] Mr. John Gibson, Junr., W.S., Mr. James Jollie, W.S., and Mr. Alexander Monypenny, W.S., {{were the}} three gentlemen who {{ultimately}} {{agreed to take}} charge, as trustees, of Sir Walter Scott's affairs; and certainly no gentlemen ever acquitted themselves of such an office in a manner more honourable to themselves, or more satisfactory to a client and his creditors.--J.G.L. Mr. Gibson wrote a little volume of Reminiscences of Scott, {{which was published in}} 1871. This old friend died in 1879. [...] "In the month of January 1826," [...] says Mr. Gibson, [...] "Sir Walter called upon me, and explained how matters stood with the two houses referred to, adding that he himself was a partner in one of them--that bills were falling due and dishonoured--and that some immediate arrangement was indispensably necessary. In such circumstances, only two modes of proceeding could be thought of--either that he should avail himself of the Bankrupt Act, and allow his estate to be sequestrated, or that he should <b>execute</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> conveyance for behoof of his creditors. The latter course was preferred for various reasons, but chiefly out of regard for his own feeling." [...] Reminiscences, p. 12. See entry in Journal under Jan. 24.|$|E

If <b>a</b> revocable living <b>trust</b> {{is used as a}} part of an estate plan, the key to probate avoidance is ensuring that the living trust is [...] "funded" [...] during the lifetime of the person establishing the <b>trust.</b> After <b>executing</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> agreement, the settlor should ensure that all assets are properly re-registered {{in the name of the}} living trust.

5000|$|Transactions {{involving}} {{deeds of}} trust are normally structured, {{at least in}} theory, so that the lender/beneficiary gives the borrower/trustor {{the money to buy}} the property; the borrower/trustor tenders the money to the seller; the seller <b>executes</b> <b>a</b> grant deed giving the property to the borrower/trustor; and the borrower/trustor immediately <b>executes</b> <b>a</b> deed of <b>trust</b> giving the property to the trustee to be held in trust for the lender/beneficiary. In reality, an escrow holder is always used so that the transaction does not close until the escrow holder has the funds, grant deed, and deed of trust in their possession, so that the transaction can be easily rescinded if one party is unable to complete its part of the deal.|$|R
5000|$|Colonel Conn had heavily {{invested}} {{money in}} other businesses. One of his disappointments was {{his involvement with}} early electrical generating systems. In 1904 he constructed a powerhouse and provided electrical service as a competitor to the Indiana and Michigan Electric Company. They later bought out Conn's service at a great sacrifice to himself. The turning point to Conn's financial affairs and public life took place in April 1911 {{when he and his}} wife <b>executed</b> <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> deed for $200,000 covering all their possessions for the purposes of bonding the Conn indebtedness and securing working capital, the longest bond to mature in ten years. Conn's money problems stemmed partly from failed ventures like his entry into the utilities business, the building of his third factory, and its loss to fire, and his loss of a costly lawsuit filed against him by a former company manager. The deed included in addition to the horn factory and what was then known as the Angledile Scale Company, and The Elkhart Truth, some sixty descriptions of real estate in Elkhart and vicinity, various real estate mortgages, 125 shares of stock in the Simplex Motor Car Company of Mishawaka, Indiana, a seagoing yacht, a lake motor launch, and much valuable personal property. Conn also lost considerable face when he was ordered by a judge to publicly apologize for publishing inflammatory comments about J. W. Pepper. The Musical Courier picked up on the legal problems and reported about how Conn was knowingly making false statements about Pepper. In his published apology, Conn attributed his aberrant behavior on an addiction to tobacco.|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} work [16], we give a type system that guarantees that well-typed multithreaded programs are possibilistically noninterfering. If thread scheduling is probabilistic, however, then well-typed programs may have probabilistic timing channels. We describe {{how they can}} be eliminated without making the type system more restrictive. We show that well-typed concurrent programs are probabilistically noninterfering if every total command with a guard containing high variables executes atomically. The proof uses the notion of a probabilistic state of a computation from Kozen's work in the denotational semantics of probabilistic programs [11]. 1 1 Introduction This work is motivated by applications of mobile code where programs are downloaded, as needed, and <b>executed</b> on <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> host.

40|$|The {{future of}} digital systems is {{complexity}}, and complexity {{is the worst}} enemy of security. [...] Bruce Schneier [40]. The large size and high complexity of securitysensitive applications and systems software is a primary cause for their poor testability and high vulnerability. One approach to alleviate this problem is to extract the securitysensitive parts of application and systems software, thereby reducing the size and complexity of software {{that needs to be}} trusted. At the system software level, we use the Nizza architecture which relies on <b>a</b> kernelized <b>trusted</b> computing base (TCB) and on the reuse of legacy code using trusted wrappers to minimize the size of the TCB. At the application level, we extract the security-sensitive portions of an already existing application into an AppCore. The AppCore is <b>executed</b> as <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> process in the Nizza architecture {{while the rest of the}} application <b>executes</b> on <b>a</b> virtualized, untrusted legacy operating system. In three case studies of real-world applications (e-commerce transaction client, VPN gateway and digital signatures in an email client), we achieved a considerable reduction in code size and complexity. In contrast to the few hundred thousand lines of current application software code running on millions of lines of systems software code, we have AppCores with tens of thousands of lines of code running on a hundred thousand lines of systems software code. We also show the performance penalty of AppCores to be modest (a few percent) compared to current software...|$|R

40|$|In-network {{aggregation}} is {{an important}} paradigm for current and future networked systems, enabling efficient cooperate processing of aggregate information, while providing sub-linear scalability properties. However, security of this important class of algorithms has to date not been sufficiently addressed. In this dissertation, {{we focus on the}} integrity properties of in-network aggregation algorithms, with emphasis on the sub-goals of correctness and completeness. We propose an efficient solution that provides strong correctness guarantees by ensuring individual node integrity a priori by applying the principles of trusted systems. To this end, we propose dedicated trusted sensor and aggregator modules. Trusted modules, in conjunction with cryptographic authentication and transport protocols, are applied to construct trusted aggregation overlays, giving strong guarantees in terms of correctness. We support our findings by a proof-of-concept prototype in a single aggregator model, as well as a design for a hierarchical in-network aggregation system. Completeness is a more elusive goal than correctness, if only for the fact that drops and message corruptions are a fact of life in distributed systems. Hence, it may not be possible to distinguish between benign and malicious losses. Building on the trusted systems solution for correctness, we propose a protocol that decreases the adversarial influence in a tree-based aggregation network. We exploit the fact that a secure protocol can be <b>executed</b> over <b>a</b> <b>trusted</b> overlay, enabling per-edge fault detection and dissemination of edge ratings. Simulation-based trials suggest that the presented protocol achieves significant reduction in the potential impact an adversary can have on the completeness of aggregate results.

5000|$|In {{the states}} that enforce [...] "power of sale" [...] clauses, the courts have uniformly held that by <b>executing</b> <b>a</b> deed of <b>trust</b> with <b>a</b> [...] "power of sale" [...] clause, the owner has {{authorized}} the trustee to conduct a nonjudicial foreclosure {{in the event of}} default. [...] That is, unlike a mortgage, the lender need not sue the borrower in a state court; instead, the lender/beneficiary merely directs the trustee to mail (or serve, publish, or record) certain notices required by law, culminating in a [...] "trustee's sale" [...] at which the trustee auctions the property to the highest bidder. The borrower's equitable title normally terminates automatically by operation of law (under applicable statutes or case law) at the trustee's sale. The trustee then issues a deed conveying the legal and equitable title to the property in fee simple to the highest bidder. In turn, the successful bidder records the deed and becomes the owner of record. Thus, the advantage of deeds of trust is that the lender can recover the value of the collateral for the loan much more quickly, and without the expense and uncertainty of suing the borrower, which is why lenders overwhelmingly prefer such deeds to mortgages.|$|R
40|$|Anti-tampering {{is a form}} of {{software}} protection conceived to detect and avoid the execution of tampered programs. Tamper detection assesses programs' integrity with load- or execution-time checks. Avoidance reacts to tampered programs by stopping or rendering them unusable. General purpose reactions (such as halting the execution) stand out like a lighthouse in the code and are quite easy to defeat by an attacker. More sophisticated reactions, which degrade the user experience or the quality of service, are less easy to locate and remove but are too tangled with the program's business logic, and are thus difﬁcult to automate by a general purpose protection tool. In the present paper, we propose a novel approach to anti-tampering that (i) fully automatically applies to a target program, (ii) uses Remote Attestation for detection purposes and (iii) adopts a server-side reaction that is difﬁcult to block by an attacker. By means of Client/Server Code Splitting, a crucial part of the program is removed from the client and <b>executed</b> on <b>a</b> remote <b>trusted</b> server in sync with the client. If a client program provides evidences of its integrity, the part moved to the server is <b>executed.</b> Otherwise, <b>a</b> server-side reaction logic may (temporarily or deﬁnitely) decide to stop serving it. Therefore, a tampered client application can not continue its execution. We assessed our automatic protection too on a case study Android application. Experimental results show that all the original and tampered executions are correctly detected, reactions are promptly applied, and execution overhead is on an acceptable level...|$|R
