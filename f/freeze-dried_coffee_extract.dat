40|$|Abstract The {{physicochemical}} characteristics of <b>coffees</b> <b>extracted</b> using 7 different extraction methods were investigated. The pH values of <b>coffees</b> <b>extracted</b> via different extraction methods ranged from 5. 26 to 5. 54, and <b>coffee</b> <b>extracted</b> by Ibrik {{had the highest}} pH among all samples. The soluble solid content and titratable acidity of <b>coffee</b> <b>extracted</b> using an Espresso machine {{were significantly higher than}} those obtained using other extraction methods. Furthermore, the total phenol and caffeine contents of <b>coffee</b> <b>extracted</b> using an Espresso machine were 6. 46 and 2. 65 mg/mL, respectively. In regard to color, the L*, a * and b * values of <b>coffee</b> <b>extracted</b> via different extraction methods were in the ranges of 0. 81 - 38. 94, 4. 49 - 37. 75, and 0. 71 - 66. 42, respectively.

40|$|Javamide-I/javamide-II are {{phenolic}} amides {{found in}} coffee. Recent reports {{suggested that they}} may contain several biological activities related to human health. Therefore, there is emergent interest about their quantities in coffee-related products. Green <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> is a powder extract made of unroasted green coffee beans, available as a dietary supplement. However, there is little information about the amounts of javamide-I/javamide-II in green <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> products in the market. Therefore, in this paper, javamide-I/javamide-II were <b>extracted</b> from green <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> products and their identifications were confirmed by NMR. After that, the amounts of javamide-I/javamide-II were individually quantified from seven different green <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> samples using the HPLC method coupled to an electrochemical detector. The HPLC method provided accurate and reliable measurement of javamide-I/javamide-II with excellent peak resolution and low detection limit. In all seven green <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> samples, javamide-II {{was found to be}} between 0. 28 and 2. 96 [*]mg/g, but javamide-I was detected in only five samples in the concentration levels of 0. 15 – 0. 52 [*]mg/g, suggesting that green <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> products contain different amounts of javamide-I/javamide-II. In summary, javamide-I/javamide-II can be found in green <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> products sold in the market, but their amounts are likely to be comparatively different in between green <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> brands...|$|R

40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of}} a regular and decaffeinated Arabica <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> was evaluated against three different Gram-positive bacteria and two Gram-negatives, including pathogenic Staphylococci strains. The antimicrobial activity was shown to be independent from caffeine content and was more pronounced against the Gram-positive strains. The regular <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> exhibited a significant bacteriostatic effect against Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at short exposure times and became bactericidal after prolonged exposure. The potential cytotoxicity of the regular <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> was also evaluated towards breast adenocarcinoma MCF 7 cells, showing to become significant only after 24 h exposure and at a higher concentration than that producing the antibacterial effect.

40|$|Although {{epidemiological}} data {{have indicated that}} a strong negative association exists between coffee consumption and the prevalence of obesity-associated diseases, the molecular mechanisms by which coffee intake prevents obesity-associated diseases {{has not yet been}} elucidated. In this study, we found that coffee intake significantly suppressed high-fat diet (HFD) -induced metabolic alternations such as increases in body weight and the accumulation of adipose tissue, and up-regulation of glucose, free fatty acid, total cholesterol and insulin levels in the blood. We also found that <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> significantly inhibited adipogenesis in 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes. In the early phase of adipogenesis, 3 T 3 -L 1 cells treated with <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> displayed the retardation of cell cycle entry into the G 2 /M phase called as mitotic clonal expansion (MCE). <b>Coffee</b> <b>extract</b> also inhibited the activation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) by preventing its phosphorylation by ERK. Furthermore, the <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> suppressed the adipogenesis-related events such as MCE and C/EBPβ activation through the down-regulation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS 1). The stability of the IRS 1 protein was markedly decreased by the treatment with <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> due to proteasomal degradation. These results have revealed an anti-adipogenic function for coffee intake and identified IRS 1 as a novel target for <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> in adipogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Spent coffee {{has been}} shown as {{a good source of}} {{hydrophilic}} antioxidant compounds. The ability of two spent <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> rich in caffeoylquinic acids, mainly dicaffeoylquinic acids, and caffeine (Arabica filter and Robusta espresso) to protect against oxidation and DNA damage in human cells (HeLa) was evaluated at short (2 h) and long (24 h) exposure times. Cell viability (MTT) was not affected by spent <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> (> 80 %) up to 1000 mu g/mL after 2 h. Both spent <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> significantly reduced the increase of ROS level and DNA strand breaks (29 - 73 % protection by comet assay) induced by H 2 O 2. Pretreatment of cells with robusta spent <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> also decreased Ro photosensitizer-induced oxidative DNA damage after 24 h exposure. The higher effectiveness of Robusta spent <b>coffee</b> <b>extract,</b> with less caffeoylquinic acids and melanoidins, might be due to other antioxidant compounds, such as caffeine and other Maillard reaction products.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{antioxidant}} {{activity and the}} protective effect against human low density lipoprotein oxidation of coffees prepared using different degrees of roasting was evaluated. Coffees with the highest amount of brown pigments (dark coffee) showed the highest peroxyl radical scavenging activity. These coffees also protected human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) against oxidation, although green <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> showed more protection. In a different experiment, <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> were incubated with human plasma prior to isolation of LDL particles. This showed, for the first time, that incubation of plasma with dark, but not green <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> protected the LDL against oxidation by copper or by the thermolabile azo compound AAPH.

40|$|Background: Dental caries is {{the most}} {{commonly}} dental health problem found in Indonesia. Lactobacillus acidophilus (L. acidophilus) is bacteria {{playing a role in}} the development and continuation of caries. Some researches in Dentistry Faculty show that many plants are efficacious for oral health. One of them is coffee bean. Coffee bean containing caffeine, phenolic, trigonelline, and chlorogenic acid is reported to have antimicrobial activity. Purpose: This research aimed to determine the differences in the inhibition of Arabica and Robusta <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> to L. acidophilus. Method: This research was an laboratory experimental research. The method used was well diffusion method using seven samples for each treatment group. BHI-A and inoculated L. acidophilus bacteria was poured into each petri dish, and then 8 pitted holes were made with a diameter of 5 mm and a depth of 3 mm using a ring. Next, Arabica or Robusta <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> at a concentration of 100 %, 75 %, 50 %, 12. 5 %, 6. 25 %, and 3. 125 % were put into each of the pitted hole until it was full, and a negative control was also prepared. They then were put in an incubator at a temperature of 37 °C for 24 hours. Afterwards, measurements and observations were conducted on inhibition zone area. Result: Robusta <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> at the concentrations of 100 % and 75 % had greater inhibitory than Arabica <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> (p 0. 05).

Sensory analyses {{were used to}} verify {{the influence of a}} mixture of these important classes of aromatic coffee compounds (pyrazines, furans and lactones) and of the roasted coffee aromatic oil on the coffee aroma and flavour of black instant freeze and spray-dried coffee beverages. In the acceptance evaluation of the aroma, the samples prepared with <b>freeze-dried</b> instant <b>coffee</b> without the mixture of volatile compounds (sample 4) were not significantly different from the <b>freeze-dried</b> instant <b>coffee</b> in which the aromatic coffee oil was added (sample 5) and from the sample prepared with <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>coffee</b> in which the mixture of the five volatile was added (sample 3), coincidentally from the same drying process. Therefore, sample (3) did not differ from samples prepared with spray dried instant coffee without (sample 1) and to which (sample 2) the mixture of volatile was added. Therefore, with respect to this attribute, the addition of this mixture did not interfere in this drink acceptance. Taking into consideration the flavor, samples prepared with <b>freeze-dried</b> instant <b>coffee</b> in which the aromatic coffee oil was added (5) and the samples with (3) and without (4) the mixture of the five volatile was added did not differ significantly, however sample (4) did not differ from samples (1) and (2). Regarding this attribute, the addition of the aromatic oil of roasted coffee or a mixture of volatile in samples of <b>freeze-dried</b> instant <b>coffee</b> had a better acceptance than those dried by spray dryer (1) and (2). Thus, the enrichment of drinks with the aromatic oil of roasted coffee, or even with the mixture of the five components did not influence the consumer acceptance with respect to the aroma, but exerts influence with respect to flavour...|$|R

40|$|<b>Coffee</b> <b>extract</b> was freeze-concentrated through {{block and}} falling-film techniques. Solute {{retention}} and concentration efficiency were determined after one stage of these processes. Ice morphology was characterized through image analysis. Preservation of volatile compounds was determined through GC–MS. The effect of <b>coffee</b> <b>extract</b> on flavour was determined after freeze concentration through sensory evaluation. Solute occlusion was higher for falling-film than for block freeze-concentration, {{with an average}} distribution coefficient of 0. 45 and 0. 29, respectively. The ice crystal size was lower for the falling-film technique; this explains the higher solute occlusion. The dewatering capacity was higher for the falling-film technique, as this process is faster than block freeze-concentration. The most abundant volatile compounds of the <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> were preserved after freeze concentration with both techniques.

40|$|The {{contractile}} or relaxant {{activities or}} both of aqueous extracts of green and roasted coffees were assayed on isolated guinea pig tracheal spirals. Contractile and relaxant activities were compared with histamine and theophylline, respectively. Green <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> induced concentration dependent contraction, but the maximal tension never exceeded 76. 3 % +/- 5. 2 of a maximal histamine contraction (0. 69 +/- 0. 07 g/mm 2 v 0. 52 +/- 0. 05 g/mm 2; p (0. 01). One gram of green coffee dust had a biological activity equivalent to 1. 23 +/- 0. 1 mg of histamine. The pD 2 value of histamine was - 5. 17 +/- 0. 05. The potency of green coffee was unaffected by mepyramine maleate (1 micrograms/ml, final bath concentration) while that of histamine was reduced 500 fold. Tissues contracted with histamine were not significantly relaxed by green <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts.</b> By contrast, roasted <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> induced concentration dependent relaxation of uncontracted and histamine contracted tissues. Tissues contracted with green <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts</b> were also completely relaxed by roasted <b>coffee</b> <b>extracts.</b> The pD 2 value of theophylline was - 4. 10 +/- 0. 03.
