5|$|In late 2013, <b>Hacker</b> re-signed for the 2014 {{season with}} NC Dinos. He has since {{resigned}} twice with the Dinos. On December 27, 2016, <b>Hacker</b> signed a one-year, $1 million contract {{to remain with}} the Dinos.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, Rebecca {{contacts}} the <b>hacker,</b> {{and says}} that she has convinced TriOptimum to authorize the station's destruction; she provides him with details {{on how to do}} this. After obtaining the necessary codes, the <b>hacker</b> initiates the station's self-destruct sequence and flees to the escape pod bay. There, the <b>hacker</b> defeats Diego a second time, then attempts to disembark. However, SHODAN prevents the pod from launching; it seeks to keep the player aboard the station, while the bridge—which contains SHODAN—is jettisoned to a safe distance. Rebecca tells the <b>hacker</b> that he can still escape if he reaches the bridge; SHODAN then intercepts and jams the transmission. After defeating Diego for the third time and killing him for good, the <b>hacker</b> makes it to the bridge as it is released from the main station, which soon detonates. He is then contacted by a technician who managed to circumvent SHODAN's jamming signal. The technician informs him that SHODAN can only be defeated in cyberspace, due to the powerful shields that protect its mainframe computers. Using a terminal near the mainframe, the <b>hacker</b> enters cyberspace and destroys SHODAN. After his rescue, the <b>hacker</b> is offered a job at TriOptimum, but he declines in favor of continuing his life as a <b>hacker.</b>|$|E

50|$|To counter {{security}} breaches at {{the hands}} of social <b>hackers</b> as well as technical <b>hackers,</b> companies employ security professionals, known as ethical <b>hackers,</b> or more popularly, white hat <b>hackers,</b> to attempt to break into their systems in the same manner that social <b>hackers</b> would employ. Ethical <b>hackers</b> will leverage the same tools methods as <b>hackers</b> with criminal intent but with legitimate objectives. Ethical <b>hackers</b> evaluate security strengths and weaknesses and provide corrective options. Ethical hacking is also known as penetration testing, intrusion testing and red teaming.|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{writings}} about <b>hackers</b> {{and their}} work processes, a common value of community and collaboration is present. For example, in Levy's <b>Hackers,</b> each generation of <b>hackers</b> had geographically based communities where collaboration and sharing occurred. For the <b>hackers</b> at MIT, it was the labs where the computers were running. For the hardware <b>hackers</b> (second generation) and the game <b>hackers</b> (third generation) the geographic area was centered in Silicon Valley where the Homebrew Computer Club and the People's Computer Company helped <b>hackers</b> network, collaborate, and share their work.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore publicized {{source code}} {{might make it}} easier for <b>hackers</b> to find {{vulnerabilities}} in it and write exploits. This however assumes that such malicious <b>hackers</b> are more effective than white hat <b>hackers</b> which responsibly disclose or help fix the vulnerabilities, that no code leaks or exfiltrations occur and that reverse engineering of proprietary code is a hindrance of significance for malicious <b>hackers.</b>|$|R

On July 2, he threw eight shutout innings in a 1–0 victory over the Rome Braves. However, he was placed on the {{disabled}} list the next day and missed {{the rest of the season}} with right shoulder inflammation. In 10 starts, <b>Hacker</b> had a 5–2 record, a 1.60 ERA, 40 strikeouts, 14 walks, and one complete game in 62 innings pitched. <b>Hacker</b> missed the entire 2006 season after undergoing right shoulder surgery.|$|E
5|$|On April 4, {{he started}} against the Lotte Giants. He pitched 7 innings, while {{allowing}} 3 earned runs, but no run support and poor defence {{caused him to}} take the loss. During the rest of April, <b>Hacker</b> had a lot of trouble in dealing with runners on base, because his pitching motion was vulnerable to stolen bases. So, by the end of April, <b>Hacker</b> was forced to make changes his pitching delivery.|$|E

50|$|In {{the second}} {{generation}} of <b>hackers,</b> sharing was about sharing with the general public in addition to sharing with other <b>hackers.</b> A particular organization of <b>hackers</b> that was concerned with sharing computers with the general public was a group called Community Memory.

5|$|Set in {{the year}} 2072, the protagonist—a nameless hacker—is caught while {{attempting}} to access files concerning Citadel Station, a space station owned by the TriOptimum Corporation. The <b>hacker</b> is taken to Citadel Station and brought before Edward Diego, a TriOptimum executive. Diego offers to drop all charges against the <b>hacker</b> {{in exchange for a}} confidential hacking of SHODAN, the artificial intelligence that controls the station. Diego secretly plans to steal an experimental mutagenic virus being tested on Citadel Station, and to sell it on the black market as a biological weapon. To entice cooperation, Diego promises the <b>hacker</b> a valuable military grade neural implant. After hacking SHODAN, removing the AI's ethical constraints, and handing control over to Diego, the protagonist undergoes surgery to implant the promised neural interface. Following the operation, the <b>hacker</b> is put into a six-month healing coma. The game begins as the protagonist awakens from his coma, and finds that SHODAN has commandeered the station. All robots aboard have been reprogrammed for hostility, and the crew have been either mutated, transformed into cyborgs, or killed.|$|E

5|$|In July 2009, some of Twitter's {{revenue and}} user growth {{documents}} were published on TechCrunch after being illegally obtained by <b>Hacker</b> Croll.

5|$|Rebecca Lansing, a TriOptimum {{counter-terrorism}} consultant, contacts {{the player}} and claims that Citadel Station's mining laser is being powered up to attack Earth. SHODAN's {{plan is to}} destroy all major cities on the planet, {{in a bid to}} become a kind of god. Rebecca says that a certain crew member knows how to deactivate the laser, and promises to destroy the records of the hacker's incriminating exchange with Diego if the strike is stopped. With information gleaned from log discs, the <b>hacker</b> destroys the laser by firing it into Citadel Station's own shields. Foiled by the hacker's work, SHODAN prepares to seed Earth with a mutagenic virus—the same one responsible for turning the station's crew into mutants. The <b>hacker,</b> while attempting to jettison the chambers used to cultivate the virus, confronts and defeats Diego, who has been transformed into a powerful cyborg by SHODAN. Next, SHODAN begins an attempt to upload itself into Earth's computer networks. Following Rebecca's advice, the <b>hacker</b> prevents the download's completion by destroying the four antennas that SHODAN is using to send data.|$|E

40|$|Hacking {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} the community of <b>hackers</b> and an analysis of the meaning of hacking in twenty-first century societies. On the one hand, <b>hackers</b> infect the computers of the world, entering where they are not invited, taking over not just individual workstations but whole networks. On the other, <b>hackers</b> write the software that fuels the Internet, from the most popular web programmes to software fundamental to the Internet's existence. Beginning from an analysis of these two main types of <b>hackers,</b> categorised as crackers and Free Software/Open Source respectively, Tim Jordan gives the reader insight into the varied identities of <b>hackers,</b> including: • Hacktivism; <b>hackers</b> and populist politics • Cyberwar; <b>hackers</b> and the nation-state • Digital Proletariat; hacking for the man • Viruses; virtual life on the Internet • Digital Commons; hacking without software • Cypherpunks; encryption and digital security • Nerds and Geeks; hacking cultures or hacking without the hack • Cybercrime; blackest of black hat hacking <b>Hackers</b> end debates over the meaning of technological determinism while recognising that at any one moment we are all always determined by technology. <b>Hackers</b> work constantly within determinations of their actions created by technologies as they also alter software to enable entirely new possibilities for and limits to action in the virtual world. Through this fascinating introduction to the people who create and recreate the digital media of the Internet, students, scholars and general readers will gain new insight into the meaning of technology and society when digital media are hacked...|$|R
