A smaller workfunction (∆) needed for terahertz detection {{can be achieved}} by using n-doped GaAs <b>emitter</b> and undoped AlxGa 1 -xAs barrier. A single <b>emitter</b> and a multi <b>emitter</b> n-type GaAs/AlxGa 1 -xAs HEIWIP detectors were designed, fabricated, and characterized. In both designs, 1 × 1018 cm- 3 n-type doped GaAs was used as the <b>emitter</b> while AlxGa 1 -xAs with x = 0. 04 for the single <b>emitter</b> detector and x= 0. 13 for the multi <b>emitter</b> detector was used as the barrier.

25|$|The bipolar {{junction}} transistor, {{unlike other}} transistors, {{is usually not}} a symmetrical device. This means that interchanging the collector and the <b>emitter</b> makes the transistor leave the forward active mode and start to operate in reverse mode. Because the transistor's internal structure is usually optimized for forward-mode operation, interchanging the collector and the <b>emitter</b> makes the values of α and β in reverse operation much smaller than those in forward operation; often the α of the reverse mode is lower than 0.5. The lack of symmetry is primarily due to the doping ratios of the <b>emitter</b> and the collector. The <b>emitter</b> is heavily doped, while the collector is lightly doped, allowing a large reverse bias voltage to be applied before the collector–base junction breaks down. The collector–base junction is reverse biased in normal operation. The reason the <b>emitter</b> is heavily doped {{is to increase the}} <b>emitter</b> injection efficiency: the ratio of carriers injected by the <b>emitter</b> to those injected by the base. For high current gain, most of the carriers injected into the emitter–base junction must come from the <b>emitter.</b>|$|R

5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the S-1 Executive Committee on 14 November 1942, Chadwick had {{expressed}} a fear that the alpha particles emitted by plutonium could produce neutrons in light elements present as impurities, which in turn would produce fission in the plutonium and cause a predetonation, a chain reaction before the core was fully assembled. This had been considered by Oppenheimer and Seaborg the month before, and the latter had calculated that neutron <b>emitters</b> like boron had to be restricted to one part in a hundred billion. There was some doubt about whether a chemical process could be developed that could ensure this level of purity, and Chadwick brought the matter to the S-1 Executive Committee's attention for it to be considered further. Four days later, though, Lawrence, Oppenheimer, Compton and McMillan reported to Conant that they had confidence that the exacting purity requirement could be met.|$|E
5|$|The decay {{products}} of 232Th include more dangerous radionuclides such as radium and radon. Although relatively little of those products is created {{as the result}} of the slow decay of thorium, a proper assessment of the radiological toxicity of 232Th must include the contribution of its daughters, some of which are dangerous gamma <b>emitters,</b> and which are built up quickly following the initial decay of 232Th due to the absence of long-lived nuclides along the decay chain. As the dangerous daughters of thorium have much lower melting points than thorium dioxide, they are volatilised every time the mantle is heated for use. In the first hour of use large fractions of the thorium daughters 224Ra, 228Ra, 212Pb, and 212Bi are released. Most of the radiation dose by a normal user arises from inhaling the radium, resulting in a radiation dose of up to 0.2millisieverts per use, about a third of the dose sustained during a mammogram.|$|E

By fixing BSF doping, <b>emitter</b> doping and bulk resistivity, BSF and <b>emitter</b> width can be optimized independently one another. The optimum BSF width and the optimum <b>emitter</b> width are given by a trade-off between series resistance and electrical shading losses.

5|$|Curium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{radioactive}} isolable elements. Its two most common isotopes 242Cm and 244Cm are strong alpha <b>emitters</b> (energy 6MeV); they have relatively short half-lives of 162.8 days and 18.1 years, and produce as much as 120 W/g and 3 W/g of thermal energy, respectively. Therefore, curium can be used in its common oxide form in radioisotope thermoelectric generators like those in spacecraft. This application has been studied for the 244Cm isotope, while 242Cm was abandoned due to its prohibitive price of around 2000 USD/g. 243Cm with a ~30 year half-life and good energy yield of ~1.6 W/g could make for a suitable fuel, but it produces significant amounts of harmful gamma and beta radiation from radioactive decay products. Though as an α-emitter, 244Cm requires a much thinner radiation protection shielding, it has a high spontaneous fission rate, and thus the neutron and gamma radiation rate are relatively strong. As compared to a competing thermoelectric generator isotope such as 238Pu, 244Cm emits a 500-fold greater fluence of neutrons, and its higher gamma emission requires a shield that is 20 times thicker — about 2inches of lead for a 1kW source, as compared to 0.1 in for 238Pu. Therefore, this application of curium is currently considered impractical.|$|E

40|$|Plasma-enhanced {{chemical}} vapor deposition (PECVD) is a cost-effective, performance-enhancing {{technique that}} can provide surface passivation and produce an effective antireflection coating layer at the same time. To gain the full benefit from improved <b>emitter</b> surface passivation on cell performance, {{it is necessary to}} tailor the <b>emitter</b> doping profile so that the <b>emitter</b> is lightly doped between the gridlines, but heavily doped under them. This selectively patterned <b>emitter</b> doping profile has historically been obtained by using expensive photolithographic or screen-printed alignment techniques and multiple high-temperature diffusion steps. We built on a self-aligned <b>emitter</b> etchback technique first described by Spectrolab. We included PECVD-nitride deposition because the low- recombination <b>emitter</b> produced by the etchback requires good surface passivation for improved cell performance. The nitride also provides a good antireflection coating. We studied whether plasma-etching techniques can use standard screen-printed gridlines at etch masks to form self-aligned, patterned-emitter profiles on multicrystalline (MC-Si) cells from Solarex Corp. This investigation determined that reactive ion etching (RIE) is compatible with using standard, commercial, screen printed gridlines as etch masks to form self- aligned, selectively-doped <b>emitter</b> profiles. This process results in reduced gridline contact resistance when followed by PECVD treatments, an undamaged <b>emitter</b> surface easily passivated by plasma-nitride, and a less heavily doped <b>emitter</b> between gridlines for reduced <b>emitter</b> recombination. This allows for heavier doping beneath the gridlines for even lower contact resistance, reduced contact recombination, and better bulk defect gettering. Our results found improvement of half a percentage point in cell efficiency when the self-aligned <b>emitter</b> etchback was combined with the PECVD-nitride surface passivation treatment...|$|R
