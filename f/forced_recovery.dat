Razak told U.S. military personnel on the day he was released that he was a heroin addict on the streets of Kandahar after the attacks of 9/11/2001, and that to support his habit he picked up an AK-47 for the Taliban. Once captured and brought to Gitmo, he became a cold turkey heroin addict in <b>forced</b> <b>recovery,</b> and off of his schizophrenia medication. These two facts led to his bizarre behavior at Camp X-Ray, and the nickname, [...] "Wild Bill." [...] Razaq was prone to [...] "wild" [...] behavior prior to his diagnosis and treatment before his release. He was observed eating his flip-flops, hanging objects from his genitals, causing verbal disruptions and throwing urine, feces and other bodily fluids at and on U.S. military police guards. This story is corroborated and discussed in the nonfiction autobiography, [...] "Saving Grace at Guantanamo Bay: A Memoir of a Citizen Warrior," [...] by Maj. (Ret.) Montgomery J. Granger. Granger was one of a small liaison detachment of the Joint Detainee Operations Group at Gitmo who were selected for Razaq's repatriation. Granger drove the HMMWV that took Razaq to his freedom bird, and spent several hours with Razaq, his colleagues, a psych nurse and interpreter prioor to the arrival of his exit plane and had conversations with Razaq about his activities before being captured.|$|E

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of skinned single fibres from rabbit psoas muscle have been correlated with biochemical {{steps in the}} cross-bridge cycle using a series of metal–nucleotide (Me·NTP) substrates (Mn 2 + or Ni 2 + substituted for Mg 2 +; CTP or ITP for ATP) and inorganic phosphate. Measurements were made of the rate of force redevelopment following (1) slack tests in which <b>force</b> <b>recovery</b> followed a period of unloaded shortening, or (2) ramp shortening at low load terminated by a rapid restretch. The form and rate of <b>force</b> <b>recovery</b> were described as the sum of two exponential functions. Actomyosin-Subfragment 1 (acto-S 1) Me·NTPase activity and Me·NDP release were monitored under the same conditions as the fibre experiments. Mn·ATP and Mg·CTP both supported contraction well and maintained good striation order. Relative to Mg·ATP, they increased the rates and Me·NTPase activity of cross-linked acto-S 1 and the fast component of a double-exponential fit to <b>force</b> <b>recovery</b> by ∼ 50 % and 10 – 35 %, respectively, while shortening velocity was moderately reduced (by 20 – 30 %). Phosphate also increased {{the rate of the}} fast component of <b>force</b> <b>recovery.</b> In contrast to Mn 2 + and CTP, Ni·ATP and Mg·ITP did not support contraction well and caused striations to become disordered. The rates of <b>force</b> <b>recovery</b> and Me·NTPase activity were less than for Mg·ATP (by 40 – 80 % and 50 – 85 %, respectively), while shortening velocity was greatly reduced (by ∼ 80 %). Dissociation of ADP from acto-S 1 was little affected by Ni 2 +, suggesting that Ni·ADP dissociation does not account for the large reduction in shortening velocity. The different effects of Ni 2 + and Mn 2 + were also observed during brief activations elicited by photolytic release of ATP. These results confirm that at least one rate-limiting step is shared by acto-S 1 ATPase activity and force development. Our results are consistent with a dual rate-limitation model in which the rate of <b>force</b> <b>recovery</b> is limited by both NTP cleavage and phosphate release, with their relative contributions and apparent rate constants influenced by an intervening rapid force-generating transition...|$|R
40|$|We use the {{inhibitor}} of isometric {{force of}} skeletal muscle N-benzyl-p-toluene sulfonamide (BTS) to decrease, in a dose dependent way, {{the number of}} myosin motors attached to actin during the steady isometric contraction of single fibers from frog skeletal muscle (4 °C, 2. 1 μm sarcomere length). In this way we can reduce the strain in the myofilament compliance during the isometric tetanus (T 0) from 3. 54 nm in the control solution (T 0,NR) to ∼ 0. 5 nm in 1 μM BTS, where T 0 is reduced to ∼ 0. 15 T 0,NR. The quick <b>force</b> <b>recovery</b> after a step release (1 – 3 nm per half-sarcomere) becomes faster {{with the increase of}} BTS concentration and the decrease of T 0. The simulation of quick <b>force</b> <b>recovery</b> with a multistate model of force generation, that adapts Huxley and Simmons model to account for both the high stiffness of the myosin motor (∼ 3 pN/nm) and the myofilament compliance, shows that the increase in the rate of quick <b>force</b> <b>recovery</b> by BTS is explained by the reduced strain in the myofilaments, consequent to the decrease in half-sarcomere force. The model estimates that i), for the same half-sarcomere release the state transition kinetics in the myosin motor are five times faster in the absence of filament compliance than in the control; and ii), the rate of <b>force</b> <b>recovery</b> from zero to T 0 is ∼ 6000 /s in the absence of filament compliance...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{unmanned}} air vehicles are gaining {{more and more}} interest and popularity in particular miniaturized small flight objects named NAVs (Nano Air Vehicles). One of the main considerations when building or buying a drone is the flight time and range. The flight time is nowadays a drawback for miniature unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The extension of flight time for military miniature unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) {{has been demonstrated}} through the implementation of thin-film photovoltaic (TFPV) cells. Currently, most electric mini-UAVs are powered by high energy density lithium-ion or lithium polymer batteries; however, the flight endurance is usually limited between 60 to 90 minutes before requiring a <b>forced</b> <b>recovery</b> to replace exhausted batteries. In this thesis, the viability of extending flight endurance by complementing the on-board battery source of a mini-UAV using advanced TFPV cells made of copper-indium-gallium di-selenide (CIGS) semiconductor materials is considered. In order to achieve a higher efficiency, the simulation and testing phase incorporates {{the use of a}} DC-to-DC converter and a maximum power point tracking device or algorithm to provide the desired output voltage and deliver maximum power from the TFPV cells to the battery and load. In addition to investigating the application of TFPV cell technology, development of new high power/energy density batteries and fuel cells technologies, as well as the potential benefit of applying less mature, high-efficiency photovoltaic cells to military UAVs are also considered...|$|E

The {{effect of this}} stimulation on contractility was examined in rat soleus muscles exposed to high extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o). At a [K+]o of 10 mm, tetanic force declined to 58 % of the force in standard buffer with 5. 9 mm K+. Subsequent direct stimulation of the muscle at 1 min intervals with 30 Hz pulse trains of 2 s duration induced a 97 % <b>recovery</b> of <b>force</b> within 14 min. <b>Force</b> <b>recovery</b> could also be elicited by stimulation via the nerve. In muscles exposed to 12. 5 mm K+, 30 Hz pulse trains of 2 s duration at 1 min intervals induced a <b>recovery</b> of <b>force</b> from 16 ± 2 to 62 ± 4 % of the initial control force at a [K+]o of 5. 9 mm.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis {{is the issue}} of procedure of social security insurance and allowance for state employment policy collection, procedure for debt recovery and securing of claims by all available legal means and evaluation of impacts on social situation of individuals. Social security insurance is, in addition to taxes, fees and custom duties, a revenue of state budget. It is based on the solidarity principle: young people help with their payments to the elderly, healthy people help ill people and people in a difficult life situation. The solidarity principle works reliably in all developed countries of the world. By collecting social security insurance, the State creates financial resources for implementation of fundamental social rights, which are guaranteed by international conventions and the Constitution of the Czech Republic, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. The main objective of this thesis is, based on interviews with payers of insurance premiums and document analysis, in the first part to make a survey of impact of recovery of claims in conducted execution proceedings into social situation of clients of District Social Security Administration Office in Strakonice and in the second part to determine to what extent the <b>forced</b> <b>recovery</b> of lawful duty has a share in deterioration of life situation of individuals. To achieve the defined goal I have chosen a method of document analysis, content analysis technique and secondary data analysis. As an additional method I used interviewing, the method of semi-structured interview. In order to obtain as much information about this topic as possible, I used qualitative research to collect primary data. The target group consisted of payers or former payers of insurance premiums who are also debtors of District Social Security Administration Office in Strakonice and whose insurance premium debt and penalty was recovered by administrative or judicial enforcement. Objective of the thesis has been achieved. Results of the research will raise awareness of the studied issues and may be used in practice during operation of executions in the district Social Security Administration offices...|$|E

40|$|Loss of K+ {{from active}} muscles, leading to {{increased}} [K+]o, {{has been proposed}} to cause muscle fatigue by reducing excitability. Since exercise increases muscle temperature, we investigated the influence of temperature on muscle [K+]o sensitivity. Intact rat soleus or extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were mounted on force transducers and stimulated electrically to evoke short isometric tetani at regular intervals. In each experiment, control force at 4 mM K+ was initially determined at every temperature used. In soleus muscles at 20 °C, 9 mM K+ reduced force to 33 ± 5 % of control force. Increasing the temperature to 30 °C restored force to 89 ± 5 % of control force. Likewise, at 30 °C 11 mM K+ reduced force to 16 ± 4 % and increasing the temperature to 35 °C restored force to 35 ± 5 %. Similar results were obtained using EDL. The <b>force</b> <b>recovery</b> induced by elevating temperature, reflecting reduced [K+]o sensitivity, was associated with improved excitability assessed from compound action potentials. <b>Force</b> <b>recovery</b> induced by a temperature elevation from 20 to 30 °C was associated with hyperpolarization (5 mV), reduced [Na+]i and a 93 % increase in Na+-K+ pump activity. The <b>force</b> <b>recovery</b> was blocked by ouabain. Since intensive exercise leads to lactic acidosis and increased plasma catecholamines, {{the effect of these}} two factors was also investigated. At 11 mM K+, force was completely restored by combining temperature elevation (30 to 35 °C), L-lactic acid (10 mM) and the β 2 -agonist salbutamol (10 − 5 M). We suggest an exercise scenario where the depressing action of exercise-induced hyperkalaemia is counteracted by elevated muscle temperature, lactic acidosis and catecholamines...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that following eccentric exercise (contractions during which muscles are actively lengthened) and myotoxic injection, disturbances in the regulation of intracellular calcium (Ca 2 +) homeostasis and increased rate of protein degradation will eventually lead to muscle damage (see Allen et al., 2005). Enhancing {{the rate at which}} muscles recover from injury may involve reducing the initial amount of damage by improving the intracellular Ca 2 + handling ability of the muscle, or increasing the rate of regeneration by enhancing muscle protein synthesis. Two dietary supplements that may accomplish this are creatine monohydrate and whey protein. Thus, the purpose of this thesis was {{to examine the effects of}} creatine monohydrate and whey protein consumption on <b>force</b> <b>recovery</b> after eccentrically-induced muscle damage in healthy individuals. Moreover, to confirm these results by analysing <b>force</b> <b>recovery</b> in two parallel animal studies after controlled, chemically-induced injury.

40|$|A phosphorylated, single {{cysteine}} mutant of {{nucleoside diphosphate}} kinase, labeled with N-[2 -(iodoacetamido) ethyl]- 7 -diethylaminocoumarin- 3 -carboxamide (P∼NDPK-IDCC), {{was used as}} a fluorescence probe for time-resolved measurement of changes in [MgADP] during contraction of single permeabilized rabbit psoas fibers. The dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated protein by MgADP occurs within the lattice environment of permeabilized fibers with a second-order rate constant at 12 °C of 105 M− 1 s− 1. This dephosphorylation is accompanied by a change in coumarin fluorescence. We report the time course of P∼NDPK-IDCC dephosphorylation during the period of active isometric force redevelopment after quick release of fiber strain at pCa 2 + of 4. 5. After a rapid length decrease of 0. 5 % was applied to the fiber, the extra NDPK-IDCC produced during <b>force</b> <b>recovery,</b> above the value during the approximately steady state of isometric contraction, was 2. 7 ± 0. 6 μM and 4. 7 ± 1. 5 μM at 12 and 20 °C, respectively. The rates of P∼NDPK-IDCC dephosphorylation during <b>force</b> <b>recovery</b> were 28 and 50 s− 1 at 12 and 20 °C, respectively. The time courses of isometric force and P∼NDPK-IDCC dephosphorylation were simulated using a seven-state reaction scheme. Relative isometric force was modeled by changes in the occupancy of strongly bound A. M. ADP. Pi and A. M. ADP states. A strain-sensitive A. M. ADP isomerization step was rate-limiting (3 – 6 s− 1) in the cross-bridge turnover during isometric contraction. At 12 °C, the A. M. ADP. Pi and the pre- and postisomerization A. M. ADP states comprised 56 %, 38 %, and 7 % of the isometric force-bearing AM states, respectively. At 20 °C, the force-bearing A. M. ADP. Pi state was a lower proportion of the total force-bearing states (37 %), whereas the proportion of postisomerization A. M. ADP states was higher (19 %). The simulations suggested that release of cross-bridge strain caused rapid depopulation of the preisomerization A. M. ADP state and transient accumulation of MgADP in the postisomerization A. M. ADP state. Hence, the strain-sensitive isomerization of A. M. ADP seems to explain the rate of change of P∼NDPK-IDCC dephosphorylation during <b>force</b> <b>recovery.</b> The temperature-dependent isometric distribution of myosin states is consistent with the previous observation of a small decrease in amplitude of the Pi transient during <b>force</b> <b>recovery</b> at 20 °C and the current observation of an increase in amplitude of the ADP-sensitive NDPK-IDCC transient...|$|R

The possible {{role of an}} increased uptake of Ca 2 + in this was explored by examining how graded fatiguing stimulation, leading to a graded uptake of Ca 2 +, results in progressive loss of force, impairment of <b>force</b> <b>recovery,</b> and loss of cellular integrity. The latter is indicated by increased [14 C]sucrose space and lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Isolated rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were allowed to contract isometrically using a fatiguing protocol with intermittent stimulation at 40 Hz. Force declined rapidly, reaching 11 % of the initial level after 10 min and stayed low for up to 60 min. During the initial phase (2 min) of stimulation 45 Ca uptake showed a 10 -fold increase, followed by a 4 - to 5 -fold increase during the remaining period of stimulation. As the duration of stimulation increased, the muscles subsequently regained gradually less of their initial force. Following 30 or 60 min of stimulation, resting 45 Ca uptake, [14 C]sucrose space, and LDH release were increased 4 - to 7 -fold, 1. 4 - to 1. 7 -fold and 3 - to 9 -fold, respectively (P < 0. 001). The contents of Ca 2 + and Na+ were also increased (P < 0. 01), a further indication of loss of cellular integrity. When fatigued at low [Ca 2 +]o (0. 65 mm), <b>force</b> <b>recovery</b> was on average twofold {{higher than that of}} muscles fatigued at high [Ca 2 +]o (2. 54 mm). Muscles showing the best <b>force</b> <b>recovery</b> also had a 41 % lower total cellular Ca 2 + content (P < 0. 01). In conclusion, fatiguing stimulation leads to a progressive functional impairment and loss of plasma membrane integrity which seem to be related to an excitation-induced uptake of Ca 2 +. Mechanical strain on the muscle fibres does not seem a likely mechanism since very little force was developed beyond 10 min of stimulation...|$|R

Anterior crural muscles were irradiated with a dose of 2, 500 rads and injured with 150 in vivo maximal eccentric contractions. Maximal isometric torque was determined weekly through 35 days after the induction of injury. Maximal isometric torque production by non-irradiated injured mice returned to normal by 28 days. However, torque production of irradiated injured animals did not recover, and was 16 - 25 % less than injured non-irradiated mice 14 - 35 days post-injury. TA and EDL muscle wet weights of irradiated injured mice were 19 and 20 % less than in non-irradiated injured mice, respectively. These data suggest satellite cell proliferation is required for normal <b>force</b> <b>recovery</b> following eccentric contraction-induced injury...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{multiscale}} model of cardiac contraction {{in which the}} molecular motors at {{the origin of the}} contractile process are considered as multistable mechanical entities endowed with internal degrees of freedom of both mechanical and chemical nature. This model provides a thermodynamical basis for modeling the complex interplay of chemical and mechanical phenomena at the sub-cellular level. Important motivations for this work include the ability to represent the experimentally observed physiological characteristics of the contractile apparatus such as (i) the passive quick <b>force</b> <b>recovery</b> mechanism, (ii) the relation between the contraction velocity and the applied force and (iii) the so called Lymn-Taylor cycle describing the metabolism...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} method combining both a simple, fast and efficient solvent microextraction and a sensitive and selective monitoring mode, based on ion isolation ion-trap mass spectrometry (MS), {{was developed for}} analysis of perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) in biota. The method involved the vortex-shaking of 0. 2 g of tissue sample and 800 μL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) :water (75 : 25, v/v) for 7 min, subsequent centrifugation for 13 min and direct quantitation of PFCs in the extract against solvent-based calibration curves. Selection of solvent composition was based on Hildebrand solubility parameters and their components (i. e. dispersion, dipole-dipole and hydrogen bonding <b>forces).</b> <b>Recoveries</b> in samples for PFCs with hydrocarbon chain lengths between...|$|R

40|$|During strenuous exercise, {{extracellular}} K+ ([K+]o) is increased, which potentially {{can reduce}} muscle excitability and force production. In addition, exercise leads to accumulation of lactate and H+ and {{increased levels of}} circulating catecholamines. Individually, reduced pH and increased catecholamines {{have been shown to}} counteract the depressing effect of elevated K+. This study examines (i) whether the effects of addition of lactic acid and adrenaline on the excitability of isolated muscles are caused by separate mechanisms and are additive and (ii) whether the effect of adding lactic acid or increasing CO 2 is related to a reduction of intra- or extracellular pH. Rat soleus muscles were incubated at a [K+]o of 15 mm, which reduced tetanic force by 85 %. Subsequent addition of 20 mm lactic acid or 10 − 5 m adrenaline led to a small <b>recovery</b> of <b>force,</b> but when added together induced an almost complete <b>force</b> <b>recovery.</b> Compound action potentials showed that the <b>force</b> <b>recovery</b> was associated with recovery of muscle excitability. The improved excitability after addition of adrenaline was associated with increased Na+–K+ pump activity resulting in hyperpolarization and an increase in the chemical Na+ gradient. In contrast, addition of lactic acid had no effect on the membrane potential or the Na+–K+ pump activity, but most likely increased excitability via a reduction in intracellular pH. It is concluded that the protective effects of acidosis and adrenaline on muscle excitability and force took place via different mechanisms and were additive. The results suggest that circulating catecholamines and development of acidosis during exercise may improve the tolerance of muscles to elevated [K+]o...|$|R
