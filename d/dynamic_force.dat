25|$|Professor James H. Grayson {{from the}} School of East Asian Studies at University of Sheffield states that Protestantism {{has been a}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>force</b> in Korean life, and had a {{positive}} influence on other religions. Catholics and Buddhists had to compete for loyalty and attention, and it inspired numerous smaller sects. They adopted many of the methods pioneered by the Protestants. The influence on higher education in Korea has been decisive as the Christians started 293 schools and 40 universities including 3 of the top 5 academic institution. Sukman argues that since 1945, Protestantism has been widely seen by Koreans as the religion of the middle class, youth, intellectuals, urbanites, and modernizers. It has been a powerful force supporting South Korea's pursuit of modernity and emulation of the United States, and opposition to the old Japanese colonialism and Communism of North Korea.|$|E
500|$|Her early {{performances}} {{brought her}} immediate success in Britain, but she remained largely unknown {{in other parts}} of the world until the release of Gone with the Wind. In December 1939, film critic Frank Nugent wrote in The New York Times, [...] "Miss Leigh's Scarlett has vindicated the absurd talent quest that indirectly turned her up. She is so perfectly designed for the part by art and nature that any other actress in the role would be inconceivable", and as her fame escalated, she was featured on the cover of Time magazine as Scarlett. In 1969 critic Andrew Sarris commented that the success of the film had been largely due to [...] "the inspired casting" [...] of Leigh, and in 1998, wrote that [...] "she lives in our minds and memories as a <b>dynamic</b> <b>force</b> rather than as a static presence". Film historian and critic Leonard Maltin described the film as one of the all-time greats, writing in 1998 that Leigh [...] "brilliantly played" [...] her role.|$|E
500|$|A third {{title in}} the Elder Scrolls series was first {{conceived}} during the development of Daggerfall, though it was originally to be set in the Summerset Isles and called Tribunal. Following the release of Daggerfall, it was set up around an SVGA version of XnGine, which Bethesda later used in , and set {{in the province of}} Morrowind. The game was [...] "much closer to Daggerfall in scope", encompassing the whole province of Morrowind, rather than the isle of Vvardenfell, and allowing the player to join all five Dunmer Great Houses. The blight was conceived as a <b>dynamic</b> <b>force,</b> progressively expanding and destroying cities in its wake. It was finally decided that the scope of the original design was too grand given the technology current at the time. According to Ken Rolston, something was said approximating [...] "We're not ready for it, we don't want to jump into this and fail". The project was put on hold in 1997, as Bethesda went on to develop [...] and Battlespire, though the project remained {{in the back of the}} developers' minds throughout this period.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of Porcupine in 1983, NME {{reviewer}} Barney Hoskyns gave the album a negative review. Hoskyns wrote, [...] "Porcupine is the distressing occasion of an important and exciting rock group becoming ensnared by its own strongest points, a <b>dynamic</b> <b>force</b> striving fruitlessly to escape the brilliant track that trails behind it." [...] Hoskyns likened {{the sound of the}} album to the band [...] "turning on their own greatest 'hits' and savaging them". Hoskyns also criticised McCulloch's lyrics and the general mood of the album, noting, [...] "Only on 'Porcupine' itself do the various strains of despair coalesce", and dismissed the entire second side of the album, saying it [...] "horrifies the more for its uniform lack of inspiration, for the fact that every number cops direct from earlier songs without preserving anything of their energy or invention". Record reviewer Wayne King similarly commented that the album reused many motifs, such as Ian McCullough's octave jumps, from their previous albums. While he praised the opening tracks [...] "The Cutter" [...] and [...] "Back of Love", he remarked that Porcupine as a whole was not nearly as good an album as Echo and the Bunnymen's live performances showed they were capable of.|$|E
500|$|The visual {{style of}} The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is dark, twisted and bizarre; radical and {{deliberate}} distortions in perspective, form, dimension and scale create a chaotic and unhinged appearance. The sets {{are dominated by}} sharp-pointed forms and oblique and curving lines, with narrow and spiraling streets, [...] and structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles, giving the impression they could collapse or explode at any given moment. Film critic Roger Ebert described it as [...] "a jagged landscape of sharp angles and tilted walls and windows, staircases climbing crazy diagonals, trees with spiky leaves, grass that looks like knives". The sets are characterized by strokes of bold, black paint. The landscape of Holstenwall is painted on canvas, {{as opposed to a}} constructed set, and shadows and streaks of light are painted directly onto the sets, further distorting the viewer's sense of perspective and three-dimensionality. Buildings are clustered and interconnected in a cubist-like architecture, surrounded by dark and twisted back alleys. Lotte Eisner, author of The Haunted Screen, writes that objects in the film appear as if they are coming alive and [...] "seem to vibrate with an extraordinary spirituality". Likewise, Expressionismus und Film writer Rudolf Kurtz wrote [...] "the <b>dynamic</b> <b>force</b> of objects howls their desire to be created". The rooms have radically offset windows with distorted frames, doors that are not squared, and chairs that are too tall. Strange designs and figures are painted on the walls of corridors and rooms, and trees outside have twisted branches that sometimes resemble tentacles.|$|E

The material culture evidence shows that people adopted and adapted styles based on set roles and styles. John Hines, commenting on the diversity of nearly a thousand glass beads and many different clothes clasps from Lakenheath, states that these reveal a [...] "society where people relied on others to fulfill a role" [...] and [...] "what they had around them was making a statement", not one about the individual, but about [...] "identity between small groups not within small groups".|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} signers of {{the first}} Humanist Manifesto of 1933, declared themselves to be religious humanists. Because, in their view, traditional religions were failing {{to meet the needs}} of their day, the signers of 1933 declared it a necessity to establish a religion that was a <b>dynamic</b> <b>force</b> {{to meet the needs of}} the day. However, this [...] "religion" [...] did not profess a belief in any god. Since then two additional Manifestos were written to replace the first. In the Preface of Humanist Manifesto II, in 1973, the authors Paul Kurtz and Edwin H. Wilson assert that faith and knowledge are required for a hopeful vision for the future. Manifesto II references a section on Religion and states traditional religion renders a disservice to humanity. ManifestoII recognizes the following groups to be part of their naturalistic philosophy: [...] "scientific", [...] "ethical", [...] "democratic", [...] "religious", and [...] "Marxist" [...] humanism.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is to present a theory for the <b>dynamic</b> {{radiation}} <b>force</b> produced by dual-frequency ultrasound beams in lossless and non-dispersive fluids. A formula for the <b>dynamic</b> radiation <b>force</b> exerted on a three-dimensional object by a dual-frequency beam is obtained stemming from the fluid dynamics equations. Dependence of the <b>dynamic</b> radiation <b>force</b> to nonlinear effects of the medium is analyzed. The developed theory is applied to calculate the <b>dynamic</b> radiation <b>force</b> exerted on solid elastic (brass and stainless steel) spheres by a low-amplitude dual-frequency plane wave. The <b>dynamic</b> radiation <b>force</b> is calculated by solving the dual-frequency plane wave scattering problem for solid elastic spheres. Results show that the <b>dynamic</b> radiation <b>force</b> on the analized spheres presents fluctuations similar to those present in the static radiation force. Furthermore, analysis of the static and the <b>dynamic</b> radiation <b>forces</b> on the stainless steel sphere shows that they have approximately the same magnitude. Comment: 15 page...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} the in-process surface roughness prediction in the CNC turning process of the plain carbon steel with the coated carbide tool by utilizing the <b>dynamic</b> cutting <b>force</b> ratio. The <b>dynamic</b> cutting <b>forces</b> are measured to analyze the relation between the surface roughness and the cutting conditions. The proposed surface roughness model is developed based on the experimentally obtained results by employing the exponential function with six factors of the cutting speed, the feed rate, the tool nose radius, the depth of cut, the rake angle, and the <b>dynamic</b> cutting <b>force</b> ratio. The <b>dynamic</b> cutting <b>force</b> ratio can be calculated and obtained by taking the ratio of the corresponding time records of the area of the <b>dynamic</b> feed <b>force</b> to that of the <b>dynamic</b> main <b>force.</b> The relation between the <b>dynamic</b> cutting <b>force</b> ratio and the surface roughness can be proved by the obtained frequency of them in frequency domain which are the same frequency. The proposed model has been proved by the new cutting tests with the high accuracy of 91. 04 % by utilizing the <b>dynamic</b> cutting <b>force</b> ratio...|$|R
