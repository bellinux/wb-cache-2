5|$|Albatrosses, {{along with}} all Procellariiformes, must excrete the salts they ingest in {{drinking}} sea water and eating marine invertebrates. All birds have an enlarged nasal gland {{at the base of}} the bill, above their eyes. This gland is inactive in species that do not require it, but in the Procellariiformes <b>it</b> <b>acts</b> as a salt gland. Scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes, but do know in general terms that it removes salt by secreting a 5% saline solution that drips out of their nose or is forcibly ejected.|$|E
5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the life cycle stage at which <b>it</b> <b>acts.</b> Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E

5|$|Nicotinamide adenine {{dinucleotide}} {{has several}} essential roles in metabolism. <b>It</b> <b>acts</b> as a coenzyme in redox reactions, {{as a donor}} of ADP-ribose moieties in ADP-ribosylation reactions, as a precursor of the second messenger molecule cyclic ADP-ribose, as well as acting as a substrate for bacterial DNA ligases {{and a group of}} enzymes called sirtuins that use NAD to remove acetyl groups from proteins. In addition to these metabolic functions, NAD+ emerges as an adenine nucleotide that can be released from cells spontaneously and by regulated mechanisms, and can therefore have important extracellular roles.|$|E

50|$|Section 79 of the <b>IT</b> <b>Act</b> {{provides}} {{safe harbor}} to intermediaries provided certain conditions are met by them. But, Section 81 of the <b>IT</b> <b>Act</b> also states that {{nothing in the}} <b>IT</b> <b>Act</b> shall restrict the rights of any person under the Copyright Act, 1957. The single judge had interpreted Section 81 to mean that safe harbor under <b>IT</b> <b>Act</b> is not applicable in cases of Copyright Infringement.The Court reversed this and held that Section 79 starts with a non obstante clause and precludes the application of any other law including Copyright law. Thus, any restriction on safe harbor provisions such as Section 81 can be read only {{within the limits of}} Section 79. Also, the <b>IT</b> <b>Act</b> and the Copyright Act should be construed harmoniously given their complementary nature.Further, MySpace’s role was limited to providing access to a communication system. It only modified the format and not the content and even this was an automated process. Therefore, there was no material contribution also. To amount to an infringement under Section 51 of the Copyright Act, the authorisation to do something which was part of an owner’s exclusive rights requires more than merely providing the means or place for communication. To be held liable for being an infringer on the grounds of authorisation, it was necessary to show active participation or inducement.Therefore, Section 79 is available in cases of copyright infringement also provided the conditions under the Act and Intermediary Guidelines, 2011 are fulfilled. Since MySpace had fulfilled these requirements, it was given the protection of Section 79 of <b>IT</b> <b>Act.</b>|$|R
