500|$|Life in Hell {{became popular}} almost immediately. In November 1984, Deborah Caplan, Groening's then-girlfriend and co-worker at the Reader, offered to publish [...] "Love is Hell", {{a series of}} relationship-themed Life in Hell strips, in book form. Released a month later, the book was an {{underground}} success, selling 22,000 copies in its first two printings. Work <b>is</b> <b>Hell</b> soon followed, also published by Caplan. Soon afterward, Caplan and Groening left and put together the Life in Hell Co., which handled merchandising for Life in Hell. Groening also started Acme Features Syndicate, which syndicated Life in Hell, Lynda Barry and John Callahan, but now only syndicates Life in Hell. At {{the end of its}} run, Life in Hell was carried in 250 weekly newspapers and has been anthologized in a series of books, including School <b>is</b> <b>Hell,</b> Childhood <b>is</b> <b>Hell,</b> The Big Book of Hell, and The Huge Book of Hell. Although Groening has stated, [...] "I'll never give up the comic strip. It's my foundation," [...] he announced that the June 16, 2012 strip would mark Life in Hells conclusion. After Groening ended the strip, the Center for Cartoon Studies commissioned a poster that was presented to Groening in honor of his work. The poster contained tribute cartoons by 22 of Groening's cartoonist friends who were influenced by Life in Hell.|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, Adams left Whiskeytown and {{released}} his debut solo album, Heartbreaker, to critical acclaim. The album {{was nominated for}} the Shortlist Music Prize. The following year, his profile increased {{with the release of}} the UK certified-gold Gold, which included the hit single, [...] "New York, New York". During this time, Adams worked on several unreleased albums, which were consolidated into a third solo release, Demolition (2002). Working at a prolific rate, Adams released the classic rock-influenced Rock N Roll (2003), after a planned album, Love <b>Is</b> <b>Hell,</b> was rejected by his label Lost Highway. As a compromise, Love <b>Is</b> <b>Hell</b> was released as two EPs and eventually released in its full-length state in 2004.|$|E

Two weeks later he returned to Lost Highway with Rock n Roll, which featured guest musicians including Melissa Auf der Maur, Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong, and Adams's girlfriend at the time, Parker Posey.

2500|$|The Eastern Orthodox Church {{teaches that}} {{heaven and hell}} are {{relations}} to or experiences of God's just and loving presence. ... those who find themselves in hell will be chastised by the scourge of love. How cruel and bitter this torment of love will be! For those who understand that they have sinned against love, undergo no greater suffering than those produced by the most fearful tortures. The sorrow which takes hold of the heart, which has sinned against love, is more piercing than any other pain. It is not {{right to say that}} the sinners in hell are deprived of the love of God ... But love acts in two ways, as suffering of the reproved, and as joy in the blessed!

2500|$|PETA {{sometimes}} issues isolated statements or press releases, {{commenting on}} current events.

The proposed ad drew criticism from relatives of the injured fisherman. After Minnesota dentist Walter Palmer {{admitted that he had}} killed Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe in 2015, PETA's president, Newkirk, issued a statement on behalf of PETA in which she said: [...] "Hunting is a coward's pastime. If, as has been reported, this dentist and his guides lured Cecil out of the park with food so as to shoot him on private property, because shooting him in the park would have been illegal, he needs to be extradited, charged, and, preferably, hanged." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{importance}} of various other linguistic {{elements within the}} narrative has also been highlighted by other researchers of Caragiale's work. An early observation made by Zarifopol, and cited by Cioculescu in agreement with his own arguments, {{has it that the}} author introduced references to himself and his Greek-Romanian origins in his portrayal of Aghiuță-Ianulea. This is thought to be the case for the character's stated pride that, despite being a foreigner (an Albanian, in Cioculescu's interpretation), he is both versed in Romanian culture and a polyglot. The notion that Ianulea is in effect Caragiale's alter ego has subsequently become commonplace among investigators of his work. According to Cioculescu: [...] "This is, after all, the only place where the author reveals his entirely justified philological pride." [...] Rotiroti theorizes the {{importance of}} words in defining the fairy tale's two [...] "semantic fields". The original and concrete one <b>is</b> <b>Hell,</b> where [...] "semantics are organized in pyramid fashion, and ordered [...] as signified of signifiers." [...] He adds: [...] "Even if the comedic effect [...] springs from an estranging, corporal, obscene, quasi-sexual effect, provided by the strange 'fatherly love'-based relationship between the little devil and his emperor, the body, or better said the various allusions to its components ('ear', 'tail') play a part that undermines with irony the structures attributable to this reality." [...] Also according to Rotiroti, the hierarchy of significance is modified by the earthly episodes within the plot, particularly since Aghiuță's new identity is that of an outsider who holds a succession of roles, and since his foreign name is itself meant to suggest the strangeness of Phanariote times. The latter attribute, he believes, is illustrated and enhanced by the use of terms directly borrowed from other languages and regularly surfacing throughout the text.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{study by}} the Stirling Media Research Institute about {{violence}} in the media, Phil and Kathy's abusive relationship was analysed. The explanation for Phil's alcoholism, his wife abuse, and the problems he has in relating to his son, was largely accepted as plausible. Women found the depiction of family life and domestic violence realistic and believable and felt that soap operas such as EastEnders should deal with important social issues. They judged soap operas as suitable locations for educating the public about social issues such as domestic violence. Phil's attendance at an AA and subsequent reconciliation with Kathy was viewed, leading some male participants to question the plausibility of the speedy reunion, [...] "One session could hardly make Phil capable of going home and opening up his feelings to [...]" [...] Several focus groups attributed the need for [...] "such a quick dramatic fix" [...] as indicative of the ratings war with rival soap, Coronation Street. Phil's reconciliation with Kathy was also seen as [...] "implausible", though at the same time [...] "it was clearly accepted that according to the conventions of soap opera, there are no permanent solutions." [...] The study reported that much group discussion centred on the Alcoholics Anonymous group scene, which was, for the most part, seen as an accurate depiction of an AA group therapy session. In addition, Phil's portrayal of a suffering alcoholic was also seen as realistic and a [...] "typical portrayal of bottled-up masculinity". Comparatively, male participants were generally dismissive towards Kathy: [...] "She attracted little sympathy or understanding. Her tendency to take some responsibility for her own plight was not countered. Her tale of being abused by men and her history of rapes were at best mentioned in passing, at worst treated disparagingly. There was a quite widely shared sense of how men and women are characterised as radically different in EastEnders and other soap operas..." [...] A scene in which Kathy and her close friend Pat Evans (Pam St Clement) show their competence as electricians, a scene that allowed the characters to [...] "re-examine past mistakes and agree that life <b>is</b> <b>hell,</b> but you've got to keep struggling, mend the electrics ('wait for a man to do a job and you'll wait forever') and have a laugh" [...] was felt, especially in middle-class male groups, [...] "to be a superficial kind of feminism in line with how soap operas underscore gender differences." [...] Gay men offered a major exception to this general indifference to Kathy's points of view; they readily espoused them.|$|E
