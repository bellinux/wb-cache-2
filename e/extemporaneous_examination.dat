30|$|Results: A 30 -year-old {{nulliparous}} {{presented with}} severe dysmenorrhea, dyschezia, dysuria and dyspareunia. Physical and imaging findings were indicative of deep endometriosis. Laparoscopy revealed left ovarian enlargement and multiple peritoneal implants with <b>extemporaneous</b> <b>examination</b> of “serous papilar tumor”. Left adnexectomy and multiple biopsies were performed. Histopathology described a papillary serous borderline tumor.|$|E
30|$|Material and Methods 35 -years-old {{asymptomatic}} nuliparous woman. An Ultrasound and MRI {{showed a}} polimyomatous uterus {{and a large}} right pelvic mass measuring 7 cm, with an apparent relation with right ovary, suggesting a uterine fibromyoma or a solid ovarian mass. She underwent diagnostic laparoscopy with drainage of peritoneal fluid and, right laparoscopic adnexectomy for a solid hipervascularized mass followed by mini-laparotomic extraction. <b>Extemporaneous</b> <b>examination</b> of the mass revealed a leiomyoma. She remains under follow-up in our outpatient care unit.|$|E
30|$|All cytological {{samples were}} {{processed}} with the Thin Prep System and analyzed by a breast specialist pathologist and classified as: insufficient for diagnosis and negative or positive for malignancy. Patients with cytology that was negative or insufficient for diagnosis {{were referred to}} SLNB. Patients with positive cytologies and all patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy underwent ALND. If the intraoperative imprint cytologies (Diff-Quick staining protocol) or the extemporaneous frozen sections of SLN (hematoxylin and eosine staining method) were positive for malignancy the patients underwent immediate ALND. If the SLNB were negative based on <b>extemporaneous</b> <b>examination</b> but micro or macro metastatic on final histology (metastasis, ≥ 0.2  mm) the patients underwent ALND within 2  weeks. If isolated tumor cells were identified through definitive histology, no further ALND was performed.|$|E
30|$|Abrikossoff’s tumor is {{a benign}} lesion, very {{probably}} of Schwannian origin. It {{can affect the}} skin and several organs, {{as well as the}} mammary gland. Rhabdomyomata can simulate malignant lesions both clinically and radiologically. A spiculated opacity must be presumed malignant until proven otherwise. Despite its apparent infiltrating nature, Abrikossoff’s tumor is in fact benign, and it is often treated too aggressively as <b>extemporaneous</b> histological <b>examination</b> can be misleading. Cytology is an essential factor in the diagnosis if enough cellular elements are obtained. A good quality preoperative biopsy is highly conclusive in making the diagnosis and simple surgical excision is sufficient. Abrikossoff’s tumor is often an unexpected histological diagnosis.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) {{accounts}} for 50 % of all soft tissue sarcomas in children. 10 - 30 % of {{head and neck}} RMS {{have their origin in}} intraoral and pharyngeal structures. When these lesions grow rapidly reaching a large dimensions they may cause potencially serious symptoms. Case Report: A ten-years-old boy presented in Otorynolaryngology emergency department with a fast growing large soft palate lesion, causing dyspneia and dysphagia (previously treated as an inflammatory lesion). He was submitted to a partial excision of the lesion and histologic exam revealed rhabdomyoma. After three months a new fast growth of the lesion was seen. A new excisional biopsy was performed and the <b>extemporaneous</b> pathological <b>examination</b> was compatible with a benign lesion. Definitive diagnosis was rhabdomyosarcoma. Discussion/Conclusion: The authors illustrate that the diagnosis of RMS can be a challenge and emphasizes the importance of urgent reference and multidisciplinar approach in children with any fast growing lesion...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: In oncological surgery, a {{three-dimensional}} resection 1. 5 – 2 cm from the gross tumour edge is currently considered appropriate, {{and the status}} of resection margins is the most reliable indicator of radicality. Awareness of ‘‘field cancerization’’ calls for a re-evaluation of the benchmarks of tumour resection; however, its identification is not simple because the dysplastic areas may be far from the main lesion and difficult to recognize macroscopically. New technologies such as narrow band imaging (NBI) could improve the detection of neoplastic and pre-neoplastic areas, ensuring more precise resections. The main {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the value of NBI in detecting pre-cancerous areas and/or cancer around the tumour bulk intra-operatively, to achieve adequate resection of the tumour. Materials and Methods: The resection margins of 8 oral cavity and 8 oropharyngeal cancers were first drawn by macroscopic evaluation and then re-defined using NBI. Resections were performed following the NBI-drawing if <b>extemporaneous</b> histological <b>examinations</b> of the NBI-defined enlargements were positive for dysplasia or cancer. The number of clear margins was evaluated. Results: Resections margins were free of tumour or dysplasia at extemporaneous examination; on definitive histology, two patients had a margin positive for cancer and dysplasia, respectively. Among the NBI-defined enlargements, 25...|$|R
40|$|Matrix-assisted laser {{desorption}} ionization {{mass spectrometry}} imaging (MALDI-MSI) and profiling technology {{have become the}} easiest methods for quickly accessing the protein composition of a tissue area. Unfortunately, the demand for the identification of these proteins remains unmet. To overcome this bottleneck, we combined several strategies to identify the proteins detected via MALDI profiling including on-tissue protein extraction using hexafluoroIsopropanol (1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3 -hexafluoro- 2 -propanol, HFIP) coupled with two-dimensional cetyl trimethylammonium bromide/sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2 D CTAB/SDS-PAGE) for separation followed by trypsin digestion and MALDI-MS analyses for identification. This strategy was compared with an on-tissue bottom-up strategy that we previously developed. The data reflect the com-plementarity of the approaches. An {{increase in the number}} of specific proteins identified has been established. This approach demonstrates the potential of adapted extraction procedures and the combination of parallel identification approaches for personalized medicine applications. The anatomical context provides important insight into identifying biomarkers and may be considered a first step for tissue-based biomarker research, as well as the <b>extemporaneous</b> <b>examination</b> of biopsies during surgery...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{procedures}} used to locate pancreatic endocrine tumors have only limited success in {{infants and children}} in whom the nodules may be small. Portal catheterization may therefore be useful. CASE REPORT. A child aged 6 yrs 4 months was admitted because of several recent episodes of pallor and sweating associated with hypoglycemia. Further investigation showed moderate hyperinsulinemia and low blood levels of ketone bodies and branched amino-acids after a 15 hr fast. Celiac angiography was normal. The hypoglycemic episodes recurred despite treatment with diazoxide for 6 months. A transparietal portal catheterization was therefore performed. Selective pancreatic venous sampling showed high concentrations of insulin in two small veins draining {{one part of the}} head of the pancreas (117 and 89 microU/ml). The head of pancreas was removed 16 months later. <b>Extemporaneous</b> <b>examination</b> revealed an adenoma 0. 8 cm in diameter. This patient has completely recovered, 8 months after surgery. CONCLUSION. Transparietal portal catheterization can detect pancreatic areas with high insulin secretion. It may also help the interpretation of celiac angiographs in children, as diagnosis may be obscured by the normal rich vascularity of the pancreas in these patients...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objectives}} The Axillary Lymph Node Dissection (ALND) {{is the standard}} treatment in patients with invasive breast cancer and sentinel node metastasis, but in 60 % of the cases there is no further axillary neoplastic involvement, so this invasive intervention represents an overtreatment. The {{purpose of the study}} is to identify patients with low risk of additional nodal metastases, to omit ALND. Methods The MSKCC Additional nodal metastasis nomogram was applied on a sample of 175 patients with invasive breast cancer who underwent ALND after detection of macrometastasis with the <b>extemporaneous</b> <b>examination</b> of the sentinel lymph node. Patients were classified as “low risk” when the result of the nomogram was ≤ 50 %. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and AUC (Area Under Curve) of the ROC curve of the nomogram were then calculated. Results A cut-off by 50 % yielded 92. 3 % sensitivity, 81, 4 % specificity, 80 % positive predictive value and 92. 9 % negative predictive value. The ROC curve AUC in these patients was 0. 885. Conclusions The MSKCC nomogram has proven to be an effective tool in estimating the axillary lymph node status and it can potentially be used to better select the patients with sentinel node macrometastasis who can actually benefit from ALND...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} case {{report of a}} 47 -year-old woman who was {{admitted}} to our University-Hospital following diagnosis of pelvic mass. Abdominal examination revealed a tender, palpable mass on the right iliac region. At the gynecological examination uterus was regular in size. On {{the left side of}} the uterus a mass of 9 cm was observed; its surface was irregular and no mobility was found. Abdominal CT and NMR revealed massive ascites, omental cake and increased volume of both ovaries. Patient underwent longitudinal suprombelical-pubic laparotomy. After opening abdominal cavity, a free-fluid sample was taken and the results were positive for malignant cells. Typical neoplastic localizations on both ovaries, Douglas’ peritoneum, rectum, sigmoid colon and omentum were observed. <b>Extemporaneous</b> histological <b>examination</b> diagnosed a peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma. Hysterectomy with salpingo oophorectomy, total omentectomy, appendectomy, pelvic and lumbo-aortic lymphadenectomy was performed. Retroperitoneal approach to remove the whole Douglas’ peritoneum together with the pouch malignant localizations was done. Sigmoid colon and rectum were resected. A latero-terminal anastomosis with stapler was performed. All the visible abdominal maligant lesions were cut out. No transfusion was necessary. The postoperative course was regular and after seven days the patient was discharged. Chemotherapy ended the therapeutic management (six cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel). After one year the patient is in good health and instrumental investigations (Ultrasounds, TC and NMR) are negative for recurrence. Such a case is very interesting for the discrepancy between slight symptoms and severity of the disease, the solution of which was very complex requiring a skillful polyspecialized oncological team...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine a homogeneous, {{consecutive}} recent series of patients who underwent reoperation on the thyroid bed to assess the incidence of the complications commonly correlated with resurgery. We reviewed clinical charts of 233 patients who underwent resurgery taken from a total of 4, 752 patients previously operated on for benign and malignant thyroid diseases from 2006 to 2010 by the same surgical team. We evaluated the incidence of postoperative hemorrhage, hypoparathyroidism, and recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy. Analyses were done separately in relation to the type of the type of resurgery adopted: (A) monolateral completion; (B) bilateral completion, after monolateral (B 1) or bilateral prior surgery (B 2); and (C) lymph node dissection. We also separately analyzed patients according to their final histological diagnosis of benign or malignant disease. Regarding hemorrhage, 6 / 233 patients (2. 5 %) underwent surgical revision of the thyroid within 12 h for postoperative hemorrhage. They included 2 (1. 5 %) of the 129 monolateral reoperations (A), 3 (4 %) of the 74 bilateral reoperations (B), and 1 (3. 3 %) of the 30 central dissections for nodal relapse (C). Transient and definitive postoperative hypoparathyroidism was recorded in 78 (36. 4 %) and 7 (3. 3 %) of the 214 eligible patients. Transient RLN palsy occurred in 21 RLNs at risk (7 %) and definitive RLN palsy in 5 (1. 7 %). Elective total thyroidectomy cannot always be supported as an effective policy for preventing recurrences in patients with a single, benign node: lobectomy, preferably with <b>extemporaneous</b> histological <b>examination,</b> unquestionably represents the best minimal approach to thyroid resection...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhen the {{conservative}} treatment is not recommended, Nipple Sparing Mastectomy (NSM) is proposed {{more and more}} frequently for the surgical treatment of breast cancer. The risk of local recurrence behind the nipple areolar complex (NAC) is the main limiting factor of the NSM procedure. To minimize such risk, we proposed in 2002 a intraoperative radiotherapy of the preserved NAC. From March 2002 to November 2006, 579 cases (in 570 patients) of NSM were performed for carcinoma. The median follow up time was 19  months (Range: 1 – 60). The subcutaneous mastectomy was performed through an incision removing {{a portion of the}} skin overlying the tumour. An <b>extemporaneous</b> histological <b>examination</b> was performed on the retroareolar glandular tissue. If the histology was positive the patient was not considered eligible. Then an intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons (ELIOT) of 16  Gy in one shot was delivered on the NAC area. An immediate breast reconstruction was done using implants in most cases and in several cases a musculocutaneous flaps, usually in large breast. The number of local recurrences was recorded and the correlation between their occurrence and the clinical and histological criteria were analysed using the Gray test statistical method in a competing framework. In 516 cases the negative retroareolar frozen section biopsy was confirmed by the final histology, while in 63 cases, the final histology showed foci of carcinoma. Seven out of these 63 cases underwent a secondary NAC removal. In the 56 cases which preserved areolas we did not observe any local recurrence after 19  months follow up. The probability of retro areola positive histology increases with the tumour size. and was not related to the nodal status. The rate of local relapses was 0. 9 % per year. We didn't find any significant difference in the local relapse rate according to different patient's and tumour's features. Most relapses were located close to the tumour bed but never in the NAC area. Our study confirms that the local recurrence rate in the NSM completed with local radiotherapy on the NAC is not higher than the usual rate observed in the literature and the preservation of the NAC does not increase the risk. The absence of local recurrence in the region where a portion of glandular tissue has been purposely preserved is a good argument in favour of ELIOT...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{majority}} of eyelid tumors are benign, proper management in daily practice requires detection of the malignant ones. Several clinical criteria are usually proposed to support or reject a hypothesis of malignancy; however, most are of limited reliability. In any case of doubt, outpatient biopsy is recommended, so as to establish the correct diagnosis and formulate the most appropriate treatment plan. In all facial malignancies, the first (and absolutely mandatory) consideration is control of the cancer. Then, restoration of eyelid function can be addressed, in the following order: protection of the globe by complete dynamic eyelid closure and opening, visual function (and prevention of possible deprivation amblyopia) by insuring a clear visual axis, correction of the tear film, efficient lachrymal drainage, and only then the role of the eyelids in facial expression and esthetics. For most malignant eyelid tumors, the best assurance of complete excision is obtained by <b>extemporaneous</b> <b>examination</b> of the resection margins by frozen section (by Mohs' micrographic surgery techniques, or a variation thereof). Currently, advancement and transposition flaps, possibly in combination with tarso-conjunctival or skin grafts, are the most utilised techniques. Despite the lack of histological verification, new treatment modalities, including topical chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy and cryotherapy, may provide interesting treatment options, particularly in collaboration with the dermatologist.
