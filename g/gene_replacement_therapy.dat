Personalized ophthalmology is underpinned by an understanding of the molecular basis of eye disease.

Disease stratification relies on phenotypic and genetic assessment leading to molecular diagnosis; individualization encompasses all aspects of patient management from optimized genetic counseling and conventional therapies to trials of novel DNA-based therapies. This review discusses the clinical implications of these twin strategies. Advantages and implications of genetic testing for patients with inherited eye diseases, choice of molecular diagnostic modality, drivers for adoption of personalized ophthalmology, service planning implications, ethical considerations and future challenges are considered.

40|$|Activation of {{the host}} innate immune {{response}} after systemic administration of adenoviral vectors constitutes a principal impediment to successful clinical <b>gene</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>therapies.</b> Although helper-dependent adenoviruses (HDAds) lack all viral functional genes, systemic administration of a high dose of HDAd still elicits a potent innate immune response in host animals. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are innate receptors that sense microbial products and trigger the maturation of antigen-presenting cells and cytokine production via MyD 88 -dependent signaling (except TLR 3). Here we show that mice lacking MyD 88 exhibit a dramatic reduction in proinflammatory cytokines after intravenous injection of a high dose of HDAd, and show significantly reduced induction of the adaptive immune response when compared with wild-type and TLR 2 -deficient mice. Importantly, MyD 88 –/– mice also show significantly higher and longer sustained transgene expression than do wild-type mice. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies using wild-type and MyD 88 -deficient primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts showed significant MyD 88 -dependent transcriptional silencing of the HDAd-encoded transgenes. Our results demonstrate that MyD 88 signaling, activated by systemic delivery of HDAd, initiates an innate immune response that suppresses transgene expression {{at the transcriptional level}} before initiation of the adaptive immune response...|$|R

40|$|X-linked retinoschisis, {{a disease}} {{characterized}} by splitting of the retina, {{is caused by}} mutations in the retinoschisin gene, which encodes a putative secreted cell adhesion protein. Currently, there is no effective treatment for retinoschisis, though viral vector-mediated <b>gene</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>therapies</b> offer promise. We used intravitreal delivery of three different AAV vectors to target delivery of the RS 1 gene to Müller glia, photoreceptors or multiple cell types throughout the retina. Müller glia radially span the entire retina, are accessible from the vitreous, and remain intact throughout progression of the disease. However, photoreceptors, not glia, normally secrete retinoschisin. We compared the efficacy of rescue mediated by retinoschisin secretion from these specific subtypes of retinal cells in the Rs 1 h − / − mouse model of retinoschisis. Our results indicate that all three vectors deliver the RS 1 gene, and that several cell types can secrete retinoschisin, leading to transport of the protein across the retina. The greatest long-term rescue was observed when photoreceptors produce retinoschisin. Similar rescue was observed with photoreceptor-specific or generalized expression, although photoreceptor secretion may contribute to rescue in the latter case.

40|$|Inherited retinal {{degeneration}} (RD) damages light-sensing photoreceptors, resulting in loss of vision. RD is an umbrella term covering diseases that range in severity from Leber hereditary amaurosis (LCA), in which vision is severely affected from birth, to milder forms of RP that can leave central vision intact until old age, and macular degen-eration, which affects central vision only. RD represents {{the most common}} cause of visual dysfunction in people of working age in developed economies. Therefore, these condi-tions have significant adverse effects on patient quality of life and on the broader economy. Genetic linkage studies, functional genomics, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have provided opportunities to elucidate the pathways of retinal development and homeostasis, in addition to the molecular pathogenesis of disease. A notable feature of inherited retinopathies is their genetic heterogeneity; multiple mutations in any one of more than 200 genes can cause RD. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a form of RD that results from rod photoreceptor defects, affects approximately 1 in 3, 000 adults and can result from mutations in any one of more than 70 genes [1 - 3] (RetNet). Regardless of the genetic mutation underlying individual forms of RD, however, photoreceptor cell death occurs gradually via apoptosis.

We evaluate whether AAV-mediated <b>gene</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy</b> is able to improve photoreceptor function and survival in retinal degeneration associated with AIPL 1 defects. We used two mouse models of AIPL 1 deficiency simulating three different rates of photoreceptor degeneration. The Aipl 1 hypomorphic (h/h) mouse has reduced Aipl 1 levels and a relatively slow degeneration. Under light acceleration, the rate of degeneration in the Aipl 1 h/h mouse is increased by 2 – 3 -fold. The Aipl 1 −/− mouse has no functional Aipl 1 and has a very rapid retinal degeneration. To treat the different rates of degeneration, two pseudotypes of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) exhibiting different transduction kinetics are used for gene transfer.

Using non-viral strategies, oligonucleotides (ODNs) can be delivered naked (less efficient) or entrapped in cationic lipids, polymers or peptides forming slow release delivery systems, which can be adapted according to the organ targeted and the therapy purposes. Tissue and cell internalization can be further enhanced by changing by physical or chemical means. Moreover, a specific vector can be selected according to disease course and intensity of manifestations fulfilling specific requirements such as the duration of drug release and its level along with cells and tissues specific targeting. From accumulating knowledge and experience, it appears that combination of several non-viral techniques may increase the efficacy and ensure the safety of these evolving and interesting gene therapy strategies...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{hereditary}} cancer in humans, notably retinoblastoma, has identified {{a category of}} cancer genes {{that is different from}} that of the oncogenes. Whereas the latter group of genes exerts its effect through expression, the former does so as a result of failure of normal expression. Primary oncogene abnormality seems to play a crucial initiating role in certain neoplasms, particularly leukaemias, lymphomas and some sarcomas. In contrast, anti-oncogenes (tumour suppressor genes) appear to be important in the initiation of several solid tumours of children, as well as some common carcinomas of adults. Both classes are apparently involved in tumour progression and metastasis. Virtually every kind of cancer can occur in hereditary form, so the role of anti-oncogenes in the origin of human cancers may be considerable. The prototypic anti-oncogene has been that for retinoblastoma. For this tumour the recessive mechanism has been demonstrated by molecular means, and the gene has been cloned. The possibility has been suggested that gene (or <b>gene</b> product) <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy</b> could be accomplished...|$|R
50|$|A {{symptomatic}} {{approach is}} a treatment focused on the symptoms of the patients. The first one, consists in the ectopic dopamine synthesis. Here, the production of ectopic L-dopa in the striatum is another alternative gene therapy. This therapy consists on transferring the TH and GTP cyclohydrolase 1 genes into the MSNs because the endogenous AADC activity is able to convert the L-dopa into dopamine. In an experiment in 2005, using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and GCH1 altogether with vectors, they could provide normal levels of L-dopa to rats. The results of this experiment showed reduced dyskinesias by 85% as well as, the reversion view of abnormal projections in the strium using the TH-GCH1 gene transfer. Dopamine synthesis can be fully ectopic. In this case, the enzyme AADC it {{is in charge of}} converting the levodopa to dopamine. In Parkinson disease, the loss of neurons from the nigrostriatum leads to the inability to convert levodopa to dopamine. The goal of AAV2-hAADC is to restore normal levels of AADC in the striatum so there could be more conversion of levodopa, and therefore reducing levodopa- induced dyskinesia. Using the gene therapy, in 2012, an experiment was accomplish with primates testing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) transgene in primate astrocytes. Gene therapy was made with the transfer of a TH full-length cDNA using rat TH. The results showed behavioural improvement in the monkeys that received the plasmid, unlike the control monkey. Another type is the ectopic L-dopa conversion in which they use a <b>gene</b> enzyme <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy</b> {{that can be used to}} increase the efficacy of the pharmacological L-dopa therapy by using AAV vectors. This AAV vectors have been designed to send the AADC coding sequence to the MSN (medium spiny neurons) in the striatum to be able to convert administered L-dopa into dopamine. Other kind of gene therapy as a symptomatic approach is the use of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) expression in the subthalamic nucleus. This is a <b>gene</b> enzyme <b>replacement</b> <b>therapy</b> that can be used to increase the efficacy of the pharmacological L-dopa therapy by using AAV vectors. This AAV vectors have been designed to send the AADC coding sequence to the MSN in the striatum to be able to convert administered L-dopa into dopamine. A phase 2 study, published in the journal Lancet Neurology Parkinson, says that a gene therapy called NLX-P101 dramatically reduces movement damage. In this study, they used glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). They introduced genetic material in the brain related to motor functions. The symptoms included tremor, stiffness and difficulty in movements; and were improved in half of the group in gene therapy, while in the control group, 14% improved them.|$|R
