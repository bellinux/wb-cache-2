40|$|Abstract Micro bearing {{systems for}} Micro Electrome-chanical Systems (MEMS) have drawn {{attention}} {{for several decades}} as critical components for micro rotating machinery. Ideally, frictionless bearings are needed, and in practice, micro <b>gas</b> <b>bearings</b> approach the ideal. Typically, bearings function as a separate component, assembled onto sliding counterparts. However, in micro scale devices, assembly procedures {{are known to be}} very tedious and time consuming. This leads to the pursuit of single material monolithic structures. Critical issues arising from these approaches include: limitation of materials, friction, and reliability, among others. In this paper, new ap-proaches have been pursued. Micro <b>gas</b> <b>bearings</b> were fabricated as a single component through X-ray lithogra-phy. A stainless steel gauge pin, machined to ultra preci-sion, was used as a journal shaft. Simple and very easy assembly processes using self-aligning concepts were developed as an alternative method to conventional assembly. This article presents the design, fabrication, assembly, and testing of micro <b>gas</b> <b>bearings.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|A {{completely}} {{new type of}} externally pressurized <b>gas</b> thrust <b>bearing</b> is proposed and its static characteristics are analyzed. Unlike conventional <b>gas</b> <b>bearings</b> whose load capacity depends on the viscosity of gas, the load capacity of this new type of bearing is independent of the viscosity of gas since it utilizes the choking phenomenon of gas flow to maintain high pressure in the bearing clearance. Also the change of {{the location of the}} throat generates bearing stiffness. Since the flow is supersonic at the exit of the bearing clearance, the flow conditions downstream of the exit do not affect the flow inside the bearing clearance. Accordingly, the load capacity increases proportionally to the supply pressure. Thus, the main disad-vantage of conventional <b>gas</b> <b>bearings,</b> namely, the deficiency of their load capacity is overcome. ...|$|R
40|$|Fluid film {{bearings}} are {{a possible}} solution {{to be adopted}} in very high speed applications if the operating speeds overcome the maximum rotational speeds of rolling <b>bearings.</b> In particular, <b>gas</b> <b>bearings</b> offer important advantages thanks to the low viscosity of air and to the peculiarity of being non-contact systems. For these properties they are characterized by low friction, high accuracy and life almost unlimited. In machine tools, <b>gas</b> <b>bearings</b> are adopted in applications that usually are limited to electrospindles of small dimensions (like e. g. high speed grinding, milling, PCB drilling and coatings). For this reason in this paper the applicability of <b>gas</b> <b>bearings</b> for a larger electrospindle for machining process is investigated. The spindle, of 50 mm diameter, is accelerated by an asynchronous motor of nominal speed 75 krpm and power 2. 5 kW. A test bench was designed and realized to perform static and dynamic characteristics of the spindle and to allow the measurement of the cutting loads during machining. The experimental characterization of the electrospindle is shown. In particular, the static stiffness of <b>gas</b> <b>bearings</b> and the air consumption were measured at different supply pressures. The dynamic tests consisted of measuring the rotor runout without external loads and also during the machining process. In this condition, the dynamic forces on the tool were detected using HSS and HSC cutters of diameters from 1 to 6 mm. Some preliminary results are reported...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in <b>gas</b> foil <b>bearing</b> technology {{have led to}} numerous advanced high-speed rotating system concepts, {{many of which have}} become either commercial products or experimental test articles. Examples include Oil-Free microturbines, motors, generators and turbochargers. The driving forces for integrating <b>gas</b> foil <b>bearings</b> into these high-speed systems are the benefits promised by removing the oil lubrication system. Elimination of the oil system leads to reduced emissions, increased reliability, and decreased maintenance costs. Another benefit is reduced power plant weight. For rotorcraft applications, this would be a major advantage, as every pound removed from the propulsion system results in a payload benefit. Implementing foil <b>gas</b> <b>bearings</b> throughout a rotorcraft gas turbine engine is an important long-term goal that requires overcoming numerous technological hurdles. Adequate thrust bearing load capacity and potentially large gearbox applied radial loads are among them. However, by replacing the turbine end, or hot section, rolling element <b>bearing</b> with a <b>gas</b> foil <b>bearing</b> many of the above benefits can be realized. To this end, engine manufacturers are beginning to explore the possibilities of hot section <b>gas</b> foil <b>bearings</b> in propulsion engines. This paper presents a logical follow-on activity by analyzing a conceptual rotorcraft engine to determine the feasibility of a foil bearing supported core. Using a combination of rotordynamic analyses and a load capacity model, it is shown to be reasonable to consider a <b>gas</b> foil <b>bearing</b> core section...|$|R

50|$|An {{incorrect}} explanation sometimes {{given for}} brake fade is heated brake shoes evaporate to generate gas that separate {{them from the}} drum. Such effects are easy to imagine, but physically impossible, due to the large volume of gas {{that would be required}} for such an effect. A <b>gas</b> <b>bearing</b> would need gas replenishment as fast as the disc or drum moves, since it has no gas on its surface as it approaches the pad or shoe. Also, disc brakes use much the same materials and operate well with little fade, even when the discs are glowing hot. If brake materials outgassed at drum temperatures, they would also outgas at disc temperatures and would fade substantially. Since discs have little fade, they also demonstrate outgassing is not a source of fade. Some disc brakes are drilled or slotted, but smooth discs show no more fade.|$|E

40|$|It’s a great {{challenge}} in identifying <b>gas</b> <b>bearing</b> formation from conventional logs in tight gas sandstones due to the low resistivity contrast caused by high irreducible water saturation. Based on the difference {{of the principles of}} three kinds of porosity logs (density, neutron and acoustic logs), three porosities difference method, three porosities ratio method, correlation of neutron and density logs and the overlap method of water-filled porosity and total porosity are introduced to identify tight <b>gas</b> <b>bearing</b> reservoirs. In <b>gas</b> <b>bearing</b> formations, the difference of three porosities is higher than 0. 0, the ratio of three porosities is higher than 1. 0, the correlation between density and neutron logs is negative, and the water filled porosities are lower than total porosities. On the contrary, in water saturated formations, the difference of three porosities is lower than 0. 0, the ratio of three porosities is lower than 1. 0, the correlation between density and neutron logs is positive, and the water filled porosities are overlapped with total porosities. Considering the complexity of in-suit formation, when the proposed identification criterion are mainly meet, the pore fluid should be determined, field examples show that the proposed techniques are applicable in tight gas formation identification.
