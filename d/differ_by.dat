5|$|A second {{species of}} Voalavo, eastern voalavo, was named in 2005 from central Madagascar. Morphological {{differences}} between the two are subtle but consistent, and the cytochrome b sequences of the two species <b>differ</b> <b>by</b> about 10%. In mammals, closely related species regularly <b>differ</b> <b>by</b> less than 5% in their cytochrome b sequences, and a divergence of more than 5% within a single species suggests the presence of cryptic species.|$|E
5|$|The {{metabolism}} of bupropion {{is highly}} variable: the effective doses of bupropion received by persons who ingest {{the same amount}} of the drug may <b>differ</b> <b>by</b> as much as 5.5times (with a half-life of 12–30hours), while the effective doses of hydroxybupropion may <b>differ</b> <b>by</b> as much as 7.5times (with a half-life of 15–25hours). Based on this, some researchers have advocated monitoring of the blood level of bupropion and hydroxybupropion. The half-lives of erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion are roughly 23–43hours and 24–50hours respectively.|$|E
5|$|A pH {{indicator}} is a {{weak acid}} or weak base that changes colour {{in the transition}} pH range, which is approximately pKa±1.

40|$|Indirect {{immunofluorescence}} and microneutralization {{methods for}} the detection of antibodies to poliovirus serotypes 1, 2, and 3 were compared. Of the 41 sera tested for poliovirus type 1 antibody, 40 % were in complete agreement, 55 % <b>differed</b> <b>by</b> one dilution, and 5 % <b>differed</b> <b>by</b> two dilutions. For poliovirus type 2, 37 sera were tested; 56 % completely agreed, and 44 % <b>differed</b> <b>by</b> only one dilution. For poliovirus type 3, complete agreement occurred in 59 % of 33 sera, while 41 % <b>differed</b> <b>by</b> one dilution. No false-negative results were obtained. These findings suggest that indirect immunofluorescence for poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 is as sensitive as the microneutralization method and could represent a less cumbersome alternative...|$|R

5|$|Although {{specimens}} of M.griveaudi <b>differ</b> <b>by</b> only 0.6% in their cytb sequences, analysis of D-loop data does show some differentiation between the island populations. These {{data suggest that}} the species originated on Madagascar, where a large, stable population persists, and independently colonized Grande Comore and Anjouan; subsequently, the Grande Comore and Anjouan populations came into contact, resulting in inter-island gene flow.|$|E

Roughly 90 percent of the banded wrens died within 10 years.|$|E
5|$|Aeronautical {{engineering}} {{firms were}} quick {{to respond to the}} Comet's commercial advantages and technical flaws alike; other aircraft manufacturers learned from, and profited by, the hard-earned lessons embodied by de Havilland's Comet. While the Comet's buried engines were used on some other early jet airliners, such as the Tupolev Tu-104, later aircraft, such as the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, would <b>differ</b> <b>by</b> employing podded engines held on pylons beneath the wings. Boeing stated that podded engines were selected for their passenger airliners because buried engines carried a higher risk of catastrophic wing failure in the event of engine fire. In response to the Comet tragedies, manufacturers also developed various means of pressurisation testing, often {{going so far as to}} explore rapid depressurisation; subsequent fuselage skins were of a greater thickness than the skin of the Comet.|$|E

5|$|Photo{{synthesis}} is {{the synthesis}} of carbohydrates from sunlight and carbon dioxide (CO2). In plants, cyanobacteria and algae, oxygenic photosynthesis splits water, with oxygen produced as a waste product. This process uses the ATP and NADPH produced by the photosynthetic reaction centres, as described above, to convert CO2 into glycerate 3-phosphate, which can then be converted into glucose. This carbon-fixation reaction is {{carried out by the}} enzyme RuBisCO as part of the Calvin– Benson cycle. Three types of photosynthesis occur in plants, C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation and CAM photosynthesis. These <b>differ</b> <b>by</b> the route that carbon dioxide takes to the Calvin cycle, with C3 plants fixing CO2 directly, while C4 and CAM photosynthesis incorporate the CO2 into other compounds first, as adaptations to deal with intense sunlight and dry conditions.|$|E
5|$|Saturn is a gas giant {{because it}} is {{predominantly}} composed of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a definite surface, though it may have a solid core. Saturn's rotation causes it to have {{the shape of an}} oblate spheroid; that is, it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator. Its equatorial and polar radii <b>differ</b> <b>by</b> almost 10%: 60,268km versus 54,364km. Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant planets in the Solar System, are also oblate but to a lesser extent. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water—about 30% less. Although Saturn's core is considerably denser than water, the average specific density of the planet is 0.69g/cm3 due to the atmosphere. Jupiter has 318 times the Earth's mass, and Saturn is 95 times the mass of the Earth. Together, Jupiter and Saturn hold 92% of the total planetary mass in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The EBRC's {{terms of}} {{reference}} are issued by the Prime Minister, and are not embodied in legislation. In giving recommendations for boundary changes over the years, the Committee has considered various factors, including using hill ridges, rivers and roads as boundaries rather than arbitrarily drawn lines; {{and the need for}} electoral divisions to have approximately equal numbers of voters so that electors' votes carry the same weight regardless of where they cast their ballots. In 1963, the EBRC adopted a rule allowing the numbers of voters in divisions to <b>differ</b> <b>by</b> no more than 20%. The permitted deviation was increased to 30% in 1980. It is up to the Cabinet {{to decide whether or not}} to accept the Committee's recommendations.|$|E

In addition, a second 192-base {{open reading frame}} occurs {{in the middle of}} this sequence (starting at position 122), as in several other hantaviruses. Among three specimens of O.couesi, the sequence in this segment differed by only 1%, and all changes were silent mutations. The amino acids of the S segment <b>differ</b> <b>by</b> 7 to 10% from those of the related hantaviruses Bayou virus (BAYV; from the marsh rice rat, Oryzomys palustris), Catacamas virus (CATV; from a Honduras population of Oryzomys couesi), and Black Creek Canal virus (BCCV; from the hispid cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus). The nucleotide sequence differs by 24% from those viruses.|$|E
5|$|The {{layers of}} the adrenal gland <b>differ</b> <b>by</b> function, with each layer having {{distinct}} enzymes that produce different hormones from a common precursor. The first enzymatic step {{in the production of}} all steroid hormones is cleavage of the cholesterol side chain, a reaction that forms pregnenolone as a product and is catalyzed by the enzyme P450scc, also known as cholesterol desmolase. After the production of pregnenolone, specific enzymes of each cortical layer further modify it. Enzymes involved in this process include both mitochondrial and microsomal P450s and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases. Usually a number of intermediate steps in which pregnenolone is modified several times are required to form the functional hormones. Enzymes that catalyze reactions in these metabolic pathways are involved in a number of endocrine diseases. For example, {{the most common form of}} congenital adrenal hyperplasia develops as a result of deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in an intermediate step of cortisol production.|$|E
5|$|The {{melting point}} of iron is {{experimentally}} well defined for pressures less than 50GPa. For greater pressures, studies put the γ-ε-liquid triple point at pressures that <b>differ</b> <b>by</b> tens of gigapascals and 1000K in the melting point. Generally speaking, molecular dynamics computer simulations of iron melting and shock wave experiments suggest higher melting points {{and a much}} steeper slope of the melting curve than static experiments carried out in diamond anvil cells. The melting and boiling points of iron, along with its enthalpy of atomization, are {{lower than those of}} the earlier 3d elements from scandium to chromium, showing the lessened contribution of the 3d electrons to metallic bonding as they are attracted more and more into the inert core by the nucleus; however, they are higher than the values for the previous element manganese because that element has a half-filled 3d subshell and consequently its d-electrons are not easily delocalized. This same trend appears for ruthenium but not osmium.|$|E
