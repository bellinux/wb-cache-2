Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied {{by the appearance of}} potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against <b>JC</b> <b>virus</b> antibodies which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab.

While some believe that they will probably reduce the usage of first-line treatments the long-term safety of interferons and glatiramer acetate will probably slow this trend. It has been recommended that at the moment oral treatments should be mainly offered in those cases where patients do not use existing treatments due to needle phobia or other reasons such as perceived inefficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate. They could also be used in patients taking natalizumab who have developed <b>JC</b> <b>virus</b> antibodies and are therefore at an increased risk of PML.

Polyomaviruses are nonenveloped viruses that have an icosahedral capsid containing a small, circular, doublestranded DNA genome (1).

40|$|Abstract – The BK (BKV) and <b>JC</b> <b>viruses</b> (JCV) {{are human}} polyomaviruses. After primary {{infection}}, they persist as latent {{infection in the}} kidneys. Immunosuppression leads to their reactivation, which is associated with life-threatening diseases such as polyomavirus-induced nephropathy and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. However, the behavior of these viruses in immunocompetent individuals is still an open question with no right answer. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of BKV and JCV shedding in the urine of immunocompetent individuals from the Serbian population. Sixty-five urine samples were collected and tested for the presence of BKV and JCV DNA by PCR. JCV DNA was detected in 19 / 65 (29. 2 %) and BKV DNA in 3 / 65 (4. 6 %) of the urine samples.

Tumor types recur-rently reported as SV 40 -positive include choroid plexus neo-plasms, ependymomas, osteosarcomas, and mesotheliomas. Nonetheless, considerable skepticism that SV 40 is a human pathogen still prevails. More constructively, the study of SV 40 in humans has renewed interest in the related BK and <b>JC</b> <b>viruses</b> and their role in human disease. New questions now must be addressed. In particular, seroepidemiologic studies utilizing reagents that distinguish SV 40, BKV, and JCV immune responses would be a logical next step for inde-pendently assessing viral prevalence. Also, prospective stud-ies of select patient groups using optimized detection meth-ods might determine whether SV 40 is associated with human oncogenesis in particular circumstances. The importance of such research is underscored by the potential to prevent hu-man polyomavirus infections, and possible associated malig-nancy, through immunization of high risk populations. 1...|$|R

We sought to establish a modern method for serological diagnosis of BK and <b>JC</b> <b>viruses,</b> by using purified VLPs containing the VP 1 major capsid proteins. Antibody titres in assays based on VLPs of BKV (strain SB) showed no correlation to the titres in similar JCV assays.

The antibody levels are almost identical in serial samples taken up to 5 years apart, suggesting that both BKV and JCV VLP seropositivitities are usually stable over time and can be used to measure cumulative exposure to these viruses. Serology using SV 40 VLPs showed strong cross-reactivity with human polyomaviruses, in particular with BKV strain AS, and establishing a specific VLP-based serology assay for SV 40 required blocking with several hyperimmune sera {{to the human}} polyomaviruses.
