In addition, they {{are attached to the}} properties of all materials, inorganic, organic or biological. Due to the <b>diffraction</b> importance and variety of application of <b>diffraction</b> by crystals, a large number of Nobel Prizes were presented to studies involving X-ray.|$|E
5|$|X-rays {{are used}} to produce the <b>diffraction</b> pattern because their {{wavelength}} λ is typically the same order of magnitude (1–100 angstroms) as the spacing d between planes in the crystal. In principle, any wave impinging on a regular array of scatterers produces <b>diffraction,</b> as predicted first by Francesco Maria Grimaldi in 1665. To produce significant <b>diffraction,</b> the spacing between the scatterers and the wavelength of the impinging wave should be similar in size. For illustration, the <b>diffraction</b> of sunlight through a bird's feather was first reported by James Gregory in the later 17th century. The first artificial <b>diffraction</b> gratings for visible light were constructed by David Rittenhouse in 1787, and Joseph von Fraunhofer in 1821. However, visible light has too long a wavelength (typically, 5500 angstroms) to observe <b>diffraction</b> from crystals. Prior to the first X-ray <b>diffraction</b> experiments, the spacings between lattice planes in a crystal were not known with certainty.|$|E
40|$|SPECIAL SECTION: C h i n a Seismic diffraction: Removal {{for better}} {{sequence}} strata and extraction for special geologic targets Traditionally, <b>diffractions</b> are always {{regarded as a}} special type of noise, considering that the mechanism of diffrac-tion wavefields is completely {{different from that of}} reflection wavefields. Most routine imaging methods, which incline to take the full wavefield as a reflection wavefield, might lead to blurry images, and many useful signals are probably veiled by the influence of seismic <b>diffractions.</b> However, seismic <b>diffractions</b> carry valuable information related to structures and caved reservoirs, and they might cast new light on special understandings about complex geologies of the subsurface. For different imaging purposes, two complementary aspects make use of seismic <b>diffractions.</b> On one hand, a specularity-weighted stack technology images better sequence strata by suppressing <b>diffractions</b> and other noises. On the other hand, <b>diffractions</b> are extracted from dip-angle gathers with general-ized Radon transform and then are imaged separately to re-veal more potential drilling targets...|$|R
40|$|Enhancement of <b>diffractions</b> {{and their}} use to resolve fine-scale details in a seismic image is {{increasingly}} important. <b>Diffractions</b> carry useful information about small-scale characteristics of the subsurface associated with features such as faults, pinch-outs, stratigraphic variations, and other geologic features linked to hydrocarbon reservoirs. Extracting the information content of <b>diffractions</b> and forming {{an image of the}} features they illuminate are not trivial tasks. The conventional approach relies on seismic migration, or modifications of seismic migration, and is thus limited by the Rayleigh criterion. The limited aperture and finite bandwidth make it difficult to extract all the potential information content. An alternative approach that overcomes such limitations is to turn to signal processing approaches, which extract information from the structure of the data with the aim of detecting and characterizing a finite number of desired events. Our interest is in <b>diffractions,</b> so we used a windowed or steered version of the MUltiple SIgnal Classification method. Use of this method allowed <b>diffractions</b> to be imaged at resolutions finer than the Rayleigh limit...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinematics}} of {{both the}} primaries and the multiples (multiple <b>diffractions)</b> from sea-floor scatterers have similar characteristics when the sea floor is reasonably smooth and has only isolated irregularities. The multiple <b>diffractions,</b> like the primary scattering, are organised in mid-point gathers {{in such a way}} that mid-point stacking can enhance portions of the multiple. Also like the primary scattering, the multiples can be distinguished from primary reflection events in the data by their dip in pre-stack shot and receiver gathers. Pre-stack dip-filtering in those domains can be used to remove the portions of the multiple <b>diffractions</b> that are enhanced by the mid-point stack, in the same way that dip-filtering can be used to remove the primary scattering. Shot and receiver dip-filtering can, however, damage <b>diffractions</b> and lateral amplitude changes in primary reflections. A partial strategy in less complex structure is to apply pre-stack imaging in conjunction with the multiple removal, with the aim of simplifying the primaries and increasing the separation between primaries and multiples...|$|R

The required energy of the electrons is typically in the range 20–200eV. The reflection high-energy electron <b>diffraction</b> (RHEED) technique uses the reflection of a beam of electrons fired at various low angles to characterize the surface of crystalline materials. The beam energy is typically in the range 8–20keV and the angle of incidence is 1–4°.|$|E

40|$|A supervirtual {{interferometry}} (SVI) {{method is}} presented that {{can enhance the}} signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of core diffracted waveforms {{by as much as}} O(√ N), where N is the number of inline receivers that record the core-mantle boundary (CMB) <b>diffractions</b> from more than one event. Here, the events are chosen to be approximately inline with the receivers along the same great circle. Results with synthetic and teleseismic data recorded by USArray stations demonstrate that formerly unusable records with low SNR can be transformed to high SNR records with clearly visible CMB <b>diffractions.</b> Another benefit is that SVI allows for the recording of a virtual earthquake at stations not deployed {{during the time of the}} earthquake. This means that portable arrays such as USArray can extend the aperture of one recorded earthquake from the West coast to the East coast, even though the teleseism might have only been recorded during theWest coast deployment. In summary, SVI applied to teleseismic data can significantly enlarge the catalogue of usable records both in SNR and available aperture for analysing CMB <b>diffractions.</b> A potential drawback of this method is that it generally provides the correct kinematics of CMB <b>diffractions,</b> but does not necessarily preserve correct amplitude information. © The Authors 2013.

In the early nineteenth century, Thomas Young and August Fresnel clearly demonstrated the interference and <b>diffraction</b> of light and by 1850 wave models were generally accepted.

Traditionally, nuclear reactors have been used, although sources producing neutrons by spallation are becoming increasingly available. Being uncharged, neutrons scatter much more readily from the atomic nuclei rather than from the electrons. Therefore, neutron scattering is very useful for observing the positions of light atoms with few electrons, especially hydrogen, which is essentially invisible in the X-ray <b>diffraction.</b> Neutron scattering also has the remarkable property that the solvent can be made invisible by adjusting the ratio of normal water, H2O, and heavy water, D2O.|$|E
5|$|Recently, free {{electron}} lasers {{have been developed}} for use in X-ray crystallography. These are the brightest X-ray sources currently available; with the X-rays coming in femtosecond bursts. The intensity of the source is such that atomic resolution <b>diffraction</b> patterns can be resolved for crystals otherwise too small for collection. However, the intense light source also destroys the sample, requiring multiple crystals to be shot. As each crystal is randomly oriented in the beam, hundreds of thousands of individual <b>diffraction</b> images must be collected {{in order to get a}} complete data-set.
