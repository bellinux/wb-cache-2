The reflective <b>directional</b> <b>screen</b> behind the actors could reflect light from the projected image a hundred times more efficiently than the foreground subject did. The lighting of the foreground subject had to be balanced with the image from the screen, making the image from the scenery projector on the subject too faint to record. The exception was the eyes of the leopard in the [...] "Dawn of Man" [...] sequence, which glowed orange from the projector illumination. Kubrick described this as [...] "a happy accident".|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe goal {{of display}} and screen {{manufacturers}} is to design devices or surfaces that maximize the perceived image quality, e. g., resolution, brightness, and color reproduction. Very often, a particular viewer location is not taken into account, {{and the quality}} is maximized across all viewing directions. This, however, has significant implications for energy efficiency. There is usually a very wide range of viewing directions (e. g., ceiling, floor, or walls) for which the displayed content {{does not need to}} be provided. Ignoring this fact results in energy waste due to a significant amount of light reflected towards these regions. In our work, we propose a new type of <b>screen</b> – <b>directional</b> <b>screens,</b> which can be customized depending on a specific audience layout. They can provide up to 5 times increased gain when compared to high-gain screens and up to 15 times brighter reflection than a matte screen. In addition, they provide uniform brightness across all viewing directions, which addresses the problem of " hot-spotting " in high-gain screens. The key idea of our approach is to build a front-projection screen from tiny, highly reflective surfaces. Each of these surfaces is carefully designed so that it reflects the light only towards the audience. In this paper, we propose a complete process for designing and manufacturing such screens. We also validate our concept in simulations and by fabricating several fragments of big screens...|$|R
5000|$|Doom {{was first}} showed {{to the public}} during QuakeCon 2014, where it was {{confirmed}} it was running on {{an early version of}} id Tech 6. The developers' goals when creating the engine were described as being able to drive good looking games running at 1080p on 60 fps but also reintroduce real-time dynamic lighting which was largely removed from id Tech 5. The engine still uses virtual textures (dubbed [...] "MegaTextures" [...] in id Tech 4 and 5) but they are of higher quality and no longer restrict the appearance of realtime lighting and shadows. Physically based rendering has also been confirmed. A technical analysis of Doom found that the engine supports motion blur, bokeh depth of field, HDR bloom, shadow mapping, FXAA, SMAA and TSSAA anti-aliasing, <b>directional</b> occlusion, <b>screen</b> space reflections, GPU accelerated particles which are correctly lit and shadowed, and chromatic aberration. On July 11, 2016, id Software released an update for the game that added support for Vulkan.|$|R
40|$|A {{stereoscopic}} display (10) comprising a concave mirror (12) {{that acts as}} a <b>directional</b> <b>screen,</b> a projection system (18) including a plurality of reflecting surfaces for directing first and second images (19) onto focusing means, and a beam splitter (14) between the mirror (12) and the focusing means for directing light from the focusing means towards the mirror (12) whilst allowing light reflected from the mirror (12) to be transmitted therethrough. In a preferred embodiment, the focusing means comprise a single lens for focusing both of the first and second images toward the concave mirror. Ideally, a tracking system (16) is employed to detect movement of a user's head and/or eyes and move the concave mirror so that it tracks any such detected movement...|$|E

50|$|Many applications, such as Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, contain scrollbars with on <b>screen</b> <b>directional</b> arrows for {{purposes}} of scrolling. Clicking on the arrows scrolls {{a small amount of}} the content, often single lines, at a time, and pressing and holding on them with the cursor continuously scrolls over more area on the page until released.Sometimes, both arrow buttons appear next to each other for quick, precise manipulation without having to drag the thumb or move the mouse great distances to the other arrow (this was offered as an option in Mac OS 8.5); one of them may also be duplicated so as to show {{at both ends of the}} bar, providing familiarity for those used to both separate and adjacent buttons. These arrow buttons existed until Mac OS X 10.7 where they were dropped in favor of trackpad gestures and scroll-wheel mice.|$|R
40|$|The latest {{smartphones}} with GPS, electronic compasses, <b>directional</b> audio, touch <b>screens,</b> and so forth, hold {{a potential}} for location-based services that are easier to use and that let users focus on their activities and the environment around them. Rather than interpreting maps, users can search for information by pointing in a direction and database queries can be created from GPS location and compass data. Users can also get guidance to locations through point and sweep gestures, spatial sound, and simple graphics. This paper describes two studies testing two applications with multimodal user interfaces for navigation and information retrieval. The applications allow users to search for information and get navigation support using combinations of point and sweep gestures, nonspeech audio, graphics, and text. Tests show that users appreciated both applications for their ease of use and for allowing users to interact directly with the surrounding environment. II Cit...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} respond to light is common to many forms of life, but eyes {{themselves}} — structures that break up environmental light according to its direction of origin — are only found in animals. At its simplest, an eye might consist of a small number of light-responsive receptors in a pigmented pit, which shadows some receptors from light in one direction, and others from a different direction (Figure 1 A). This definition distinguishes an eye from an organ with a single photoreceptor cell, which may indeed be <b>directional</b> because of <b>screening</b> pigment, but which does not allow for spatial vision — the simultaneous comparison of light intensities in different directions. An alternative starting point for an eye would be for each receptor to have its own pigmented tube (Figure 2 A), the assemblage forming a convex cushion. In these two proto-eyestructures we have the beginnings of the two mutually exclusive ways of building an eye: the single-chambered range of eyes, often misleadingly called ‘simple’, and the compound eyes...|$|R
