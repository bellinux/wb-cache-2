Among these, the Stud Bump Bonding (SBB) process, which is widely used in Japan also for high volume production, is very interesting for several reasons and therefore is discussed in this paper. The stud bump bonding process uses Au bumps which are applied mechanically on the wafer or on the chip using a thermosonic ball bonder enabling fine pitch bumping. The process works with available chips, having peripheral bond pads of a pitch down to 80 µm, and does not need an under bump metallization (UBM). The SBB process with Au bumps uses mainly isotropically conductive adhesive (ICA) joining. The adhesive is applied by <b>dip</b> <b>transfer.</b> In the present work the total SBB process is evaluated. Besides the bumping, the flip chip assembly process covering the <b>dip</b> <b>transfer</b> of conductive adhesive, the pick and place {{as well as the}} underfill process are investigated with special emphasis on process automation. The reliability evaluation concentrates on thermo-mechanical and corrosion effects. The SBB process is compared to solder flip chip technology using solder bumps which are applied by the stencil printing of ultra-fine-pitch solder paste...|$|E

This analysis was undertaken to enable improved process control strategies to be developed and evaluated. As {{a result of the}} investigations a new current control approach is proposed for <b>dip</b> <b>transfer</b> GMAW for use with conventional primary inverter power sources. This new control approach offers improved spatter reduction and fusion control compared to conventional constant voltage control systems. The control approach is {{based on the premise that}} if optimum droplet transfer conditions exist, then the short circuit current can be minimized through clamping, the droplet transfer taking place primarily under the influence of surface tension. Unlike previous controlled <b>dip</b> <b>transfer</b> strategies this approach places no reliance on pre-emptive detection of the short circuit rupture or on rapid peak current reduction. Novel adaptive control and monitoring techniques have been developed to assist in assessing the degree to which current clamping is introduced to the process, as well as identifying the type and degree of spatter generated. A study of optimized welding conditions has identified a relationship of use for the selection of welding parameters. The study led to the derivation of a hypothesis that defines the optimum short-circuiting event for droplet transfer. The investigation of the welding process has also identified inherent process irregularities when using CO 2 shielding gas, which has led to the development of control strategies whose actions minimize the affect and enhance the welding process stability. To validate the proposed control approach a DSP based power source controller was designed and built.

Unfortunately in the past, the process has gained a reputation for fusion defects, which becomes more apparent when welding traditionally difficult materials such as coated steels. This reputation can be attributed in some instances to the method of control used and the changeable nature of variables crucial to controlling heat transfer during the welding process. The paper examines the relationship between weld fusion, heat input and current for coated steel welding applications and evaluates the effectiveness of two common control techniques when exposed to variation in welding torch angle.

40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to address the scope for hybrid laser-GMAW process {{improvement}} using controlled <b>dip</b> <b>transfer</b> and a high power diode laser in single and twin spot modes. It is suggested that an optimum {{combination of the two}} sources of thermal energy can enhance the speed and quality of single sided butt welds. The objectives of the current work were therefore, to investigate the process control possibilities, performance characteristics and the processes interactions of twin beam hybrid laser-GMAW welding. Since no appropriate twin beam system existed it was also necessary to design and build an experimental system. This research was made possible by using a power source which enabled flexible computer control of the GMAW current waveform and a 3 kW high power diode laser. Weld beads were produced to study the basic operating parameters for the individual arc and laser processes and these were compared with those of combined process with laser in single and twin spot modes. Bead geometry and the current waveforms captured by the data acquisition system were used to evaluate the welding processes performance. Variables such as groove shape and shielding gas were also found to be critical for full penetration of butt joints on plates. CO 2 produced weld bead with deeper penetration than with Ar based gas mixtures. A novel hybrid welding head was design and implemented to investigate the process using an extended heat source (as in multicathode GTAW and tandem GMAW) to create an elongated weld pool through the use of laser-GMAW with dual laser spots leading and trailing the GMAW heat source.

40|$|Hyperbaric Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) is an {{important}} technology for repair welding of deep sea pipelines and linking of existing pipeline networks to newer ones through tie-ins and hot-tap welding. With increasing water depth the process becomes susceptible to hydrogen assisted cracking due to the very fast cooling rate of the weld caused by higher habitat gas density and resulting higher thermal diffusivity. Maintaining sufficient heat in the welding zone is vital to avoid a potential cracking tendency especially as moisture pick-up {{may be difficult to}} avoid during hyperbaric welding operations. In addition to this, hyperbaric GMAW has a limitation of low heat input because it is operated at a short arc length or <b>dip</b> <b>transfer</b> mode to avoid process instability at high pressure. Also, the short arc length generates weld spatter that may affect weld quality. The research presented in this thesis, investigated the use of an industrial laser in conduction mode for the purpose of providing significant additional heat input to control the weld thermal cycles of GMAW. Advanced GMAW power sources such as the Fronius Cold Metal Transfer (CMT) and EWM ColdArc have also been investigated for reduced weld spatter generation. Studies were conducted to investigate the weld pool thermal cycles and resulting metallurgical phase formation in hyperbaric GMAW at different pressures ranging from 1 bar to 200 bar. This was followed by welding trials at one atmosphere to compare the process characteristics of traditional <b>dip</b> <b>transfer</b> GMAW with some advanced GMAW power sources such as CMT and ColdArc. The main experimental trials to investigate a laser assisted GMAW (CMT) process were performed at one atmosphere condition. A thermal model was developed using Abaqus software to predict the weld metal and heat affected zone thermal cycle in a laser assisted GMAW (CMT) process at one atmosphere and under high ambient pressures. Finally, investigation was carried out to evaluate the benefit of the laser assisted process in lowering diffusible hydrogen content from the weld metal. The hyperbaric GMAW experimental results showed that the weld pool cooling rate increases with pressure due to higher chamber gas density and resulting thermal diffusivity. But this effect is not prominent for thicker plates. Therefore, it was concluded that heat conduction through the steel thickness dominates convective losses to the chamber gas environment. It was also shown that the welding arc shrinks as pressure increases in order to minimise energy loss to the environment. This defined the weld bead profile; although it was found that beyond 100 bar pressure the weld penetration depth remained effectively unchanged. Apart from the hardness of the weld made at 1 bar, there was little difference between those at 18, 100 and 200 bar. However, all of the welds show hardness peaks greater than 350 HV 10 recommended for offshore structures. It was observed that CMT produced the lowest weld spatter compared to the traditional GMAW and ColdArc. However, this advantage is constrained to low wire feed speed (3 to 5 m/min) beyond which it becomes relatively unstable. For the laser assisted GMAW (CMT) trials, it was shown that the laser serves as a spatially resolved heat source, reheating the weld bead and reducing the cooling rate. For the laser parameters investigated, over 200 % reduction of cooling rate could be achieved when compared with GMAW alone. It was also demonstrated that the additional laser thermal input will extend the weld residence time at high temperature (over 300 °C). This will prolong the weld cooling time such that dissolved hydrogen can diffuse out before it comes to room temperature. The laser was shown to significantly reduce the weld peak hardness from about 420 HV 0. 5 to values below 350 HV 0. 5, which will be beneficial for hyperbaric welding. The model prediction of the weld thermal cycles was in good agreement with the experimental results. Therefore, it could be used to predict the weld metal and HAZ cooling rate of a laser assisted GMAW (CMT) process although the model would need to be calibrated for higher pressure data. It was also demonstrated that additional laser heat can reduce the weld hydrogen content to acceptable limits of 5 ml/ 100 g of weld metal even for high moisture content in the welding environment. In conclusion, the addition of laser heating to GMAW will reduce the weld cooling rate, extend the weld pool cooling time, and expel diffusible weld hydrogen. All of these would be immensely beneficial in terms of improving the quality and reliability of structures fabricated through hyperbaric GMAW...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Continuum {{electrostatic}} {{models have}} had quantitative success in describing electrostatic-mediated phenomena on atomistic scales; however, there {{continues to be}} significant disagreement about how to assign dielectric constants in mixed, nonhomogeneous systems. We introduce a method for determining a position-dependent dielectric profile from molecular dynamics simulations. In this method, the free energy of introducing a test charge is computed two ways: from a free energy perturbation calculation and from a numerical solution to Poisson’s Equation. The dielectric profile {{of the system is}} then determined by minimizing the discrepancy between these two calculations simultaneously for multiple positions of the test charge. We apply this method to determine the dielectric profile of a lipid bilayer surrounded by water. We find good agreement with dielectric models for lipid bilayers obtained by other approaches. The free energy of transferring an ion from bulk water to the lipid bilayer computed from the atomistic simulations indicates that large errors are introduced when the bilayer is represented as a single slab of low dielectric embedded in the higher-dielectric solvent. Significant improvement results from introducing an additional layer of intermediate dielectric (; 3) {{on each side of the}} low dielectric core extending from; 12 A ̊ to 18 Å.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging was used for determining particulate fume size and it was found to be an accurate, reproducible, and relatively simple technique. The results revealed a higher percentage of ultra fine particulates (i. e. in 3 ̆c 20 nm and 20 – 40 nm intervals) in ‘low welding voltage’ fume plume compared with ‘high welding voltage’ fume plume. Fundamentally, the fume plume created during <b>dip</b> metal <b>transfer</b> at low welding voltages (20 – 26 V) had much lower levels of particulate fume concentration compared with spray metal transfer at high welding voltages (30 - 36 V). TEM also revealed that for the range of welding voltages and metal transfer modes investigated, the particulates produced were predominantly less than 100 nm in diameter and spherical. Spherical particles (3 ̆c 100 nm) have been reported elsewhere to reach the alveoli in rats and, hence, may be of relevance with respect to the health of welders. Slightly faceted crystalline particulates and fume particle sizes of up to 800 nm in diameter were also observed with TEM. It should be noted that the agglomeration behaviour of these particulates in the fume plume is considered important but not entirely understood. The particle size results suggest that the key to welder safety is to minimize cumulative exposure to particulate fume over their working life, irrespective of the welding parameters used.

Interestingly, the intercalated organic solvent showed remarkable stability for over 40 days under ambient conditions. To reveal the underlying mechanism of the stable solvent intercalation, desorption energy of CF molecules at the graphene/substrate interface was measured using Arrhenius plots of the conductance change upon time and temperature. Two stages of solvent intercalations with high desorption energies (70 and 370 meV) were observed along with the consecutive shrinkage of the solvent clusters at the basal plane and the wrinkles, respectively.

They are subjected to impact loading conditions that are resulted from train operations over wheel or rail abnormalities, such as flat wheels, <b>dipped</b> rails, crossing <b>transfers,</b> rail squats, corrugation, etc. The magnitude of the shock load relies on various factors such as axle load, types of wheel/rail imperfections, speeds of vehicle, track stiffness, etc. This paper demonstrates the development of finite element modelling to evaluate the dynamic responses of prestressed tendons or wires embedded in concrete sleepers, particularly under a variety of impact loads. The force prediction under high speed rail environment was conducted using D-TRACK. The 3 D finite element model of prestressed concrete sleeper has been developed using a finite element package, LS-Dyna. It has been verified by the experiments carried out using the high capacity drop-weight impact machine at the University of Wollon-gong, Australia. The experimental results provide very good correlation with numerical simulations. In this paper, the numerical studies are extended to evaluate the dynamic behaviors of high strength steel wires and their responses under different parameters in high speed rail environments. The outcome of this study can potentially lead to the dynamic design guideline for prestressed concrete sleepers under low-cycle fatigues. Future work includes more detailed investigation into the effect of track bed and rail pad degradation subject to higher frequency impacts...|$|R
40|$|In a Langmuir {{monolayer}} of {{the surface}} active monomer octadecyl 3, 5 -diaminobenzoate (ODDB), stabilized at a surface pressure of 10 mN/m and a temperature of 23. 7 °C at the air-water interface, oxidative coupling polymerization occurs when copper(II) chloride was added or already was present in the subphase. Even {{in the absence of}} the catalyst this reaction takes place. Deposition of the polymerized monolayer onto glass, zinc sulfide, or gold substrates, using the vertical <b>dipping</b> method, gave <b>transfer</b> ratios between 0 and 0. 4 on the downstroke and 1 on the upstroke. The multilayer films on zinc sulfide and gold substrates were characterized by means of Fourier transform IR spectroscopy, and multilayer films on quartz were characterized by means of UV/vis spectroscopy. Collected monolayers were characterized by means of size exclusion chromatography and again Fourier transform IR and UV/vis spectroscopy. During the stabilization of the monolayer without addition of copper(II) chloride to the subphase, the area per molecule decreased very slowly. Addition of copper(II) chloride enhanced this effect. The reduction of the area per molecule is probably caused by the polymerization itself accompanied by a reorientation of the molecules in the monolayer at the air-water interface. After stabilization the area per molecule was found to be about 27 Å 2 and electron micrographs showed the formation of a smooth monolayer. From this it has been concluded that a closely packed monolayer was formed. Fourier transform IR and UV/vis spectra of polymerized multilayer materials are analogous to the spectra of the azo polymer of ODDB prepared in bulk solution. Size exclusion chromatography revealed that the molecular weight and the molecular weight distribution of the coupling product with and without copper(II) chloride in the subphase were the same. The average molecular weight was somewhat lower than the high-molecular-weight part of the corresponding material prepared in bulk solution. ...|$|R
25|$|Newell's first {{transfer}} dealings were to sign {{two former}} Grimsby players on loan, Jean-Paul Kalala and Rob Atkinson. The winless streak was finally ended after 23 games on 15 November 2008 with a 2–0 win over Bury at Gigg Lane.. Newell continued to <b>dip</b> into the <b>transfer</b> market and in December 2008 the club offered former Liverpool and England striker Robbie Fowler {{the chance of}} becoming a player-coach. Despite positive signs for the deal to come off, Fowler decided to join North Queensland Fury when his contract expired at Blackburn Rovers the following month. Back on the pitch, after a further run of 10 games without a win, Grimsby dropped into the relegation zone {{for the first time}} this season, but moved back up to 22nd place after clinching a vital victory against local rivals Lincoln City. Despite their previous form, the Mariners ran out comfortable winners with a full-time scoreline of 5–1. After dropping back into the relegation zone for a second time, the team recovered once again after a 3–0 victory at home against promotion chasing Gillingham. After an extensive campaign in the local newspaper and with tickets reduced to £5, this match achieved the biggest attendance of the season, with 6406 spectators. This was broken with the next home game against Aldershot Town; the same £5 deal saw 7065 watch a 1–0 win for the Mariners. The Mariners went on to secure victories over Notts County and Port Vale going into the final 2 weeks of the 2008–09 season, Town's previous run of form was heralded by manager Newell down to the fact that new loan signing Barry Conlon had improved morale in the dressing room, not to mention clinching 5 goals in his first 6 appearances in a Grimsby t-shirt. The Mariners were all but mathematically safe from relegation, despite a 2–1 away defeat against relegation rivals Bournemouth – which saw the Cherries confirm safety. Fortunately Chester City could only manage a 2–2 draw with Aldershot Town which left City 3 points behind Grimsby with one game remaining, but with a vastly inferior goal difference. Chester lost their final game anyway, meaning that Grimsby were safe; however, they would have been relegated if Newell's previous club, Luton Town, hadn't received a massive 30-point deduction.|$|R
