Marge <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Bart to a doctor instead, since he has superglued various novelty items to his face. Since this is Lisa's last chance to see the exhibit, she phones Homer to ask him if she can take the bus. He seems uncertain, which prompts her to trick him into letting her take the bus.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subordinate}} clause the subject, if {{different from the}} subject of main clause, sometimes <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> accusative or genitive case. There is marginal occurrence of subjects taking ablative case as well. Subjects of attributive clauses in which the head has a function (as {{is the case for}} all English relative clauses) usually require that if the subject is not the head, then it take the genitive, e.g. tüünij idsen hool that.one- eat- meal 'the meal that s/he had eaten'.|$|E

5|$|A corrupt {{political}} leader named Chedi Singh (Sonu Sood) meets Chulbul and both quickly become enemies. Makkhi asks {{his father to}} arrange his marriage with Nirmala. His father refuses because he needs money to repay the loans he took to make his factory, and he believes that he can acquire money through his son marrying a rich girl. In desperate need of money, Makkhi steals from Chulbul's cupboard and gives the stolen cash to Nirmala's father, hoping that he will permit Makkhi to marry Nirmala. Meanwhile, Chulbul meets Rajjo and proposes marriage, which she rejects, as she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of her father, Haria (Mahesh Manjrekar)—a drunkard.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> off the runway at an Allied base. Afterwards they can fly around and look for enemies to engage. The player can open their Satellite Intelligence Map, which shows a live map of the {{immediate}} coastline with items of interest, such as, friendly bases, enemy positions, and refuelling locations. The player can perform various flight manoeuvres and stunts mid-air, such are loops, rolls, or dummy stalls. Flying, especially at high altitudes, spends the plane's fuel and the player must either return to their base or perform an aerial refueling. To refuel mid-air, the player has to rendezvous with a refuelling plane at the specified coordinates and perform a boom and receptacle refuelling manoeuvre.|$|E
5|$|One {{scene that}} von Stroheim re-shot at the studio's insistence {{depicted}} a younger McTeague in his apprenticeship with Potter. In the scene McTeague is {{too embarrassed to}} examine the teeth {{of a young woman}} and Potter <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over. A thinly disguised ZaSu Pitts portrayed the woman so that the audience would see a resemblance to Trina, but the studio insisted that the scene was confusing and von Stroheim agreed to re-shoot it. Von Stroheim also conceded his original vision when shooting the bar confrontation between McTeague and Schouler. The director wanted to have a knife thrower actually throw a real knife at Gibson Gowland's head. Von Stroheim was overruled by Gowland himself, who refused to allow such a dangerous stunt. A special-effect shot was used instead.|$|E
50|$|About {{four weeks}} later the written exams were {{followed}} by the oral exams. All students <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> at least two exams and could take five exams at the most. The number of subjects and the subjects the students <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the exam in, individually were determined by the teacher's council for every student. Students who probably would graduate with honors <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> five oral exams.|$|R

25|$|If a goalkeeper {{is injured}} or sent off, a {{substitute}} goalkeeper <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> their place, otherwise an outfield player {{must take the}} ejected keeper's place in goal. In order to replace a goalkeeper who is sent off, a team usually substitutes an outfield player for the backup keeper (thus effectively the red card and substitution takes out two of the starting eleven players). They then play {{the remainder of the}} match with nine outfield players. If a team does not have a substitute goalkeeper, or they have already used all of their permitted substitutions for the match, an outfield player <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the dismissed goalkeeper's place and wear the goalkeeper shirt.|$|E

25|$|In haploids {{produced}} from anther culture, {{it is observed}} that some plants are aneuploids and some are mixed haploid-diploid types. Another disadvantage associated with the double haploidy is the cost involved in establishing tissue culture and growth facilities. The over-usage of doubled haploidy may reduce genetic variation in breeding germplasm. Hence one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> several factors into consideration before deploying doubled haploidy in breeding programmes.|$|E
