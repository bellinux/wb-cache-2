25|$|Unsaturated {{conditions}} occur {{above the}} water table where the pressure head is negative (absolute pressure can never be negative, but <b>gauge</b> <b>pressure</b> can) and the water that incompletely fills the pores of the aquifer material is under suction. The water content in the unsaturated zone is {{held in place by}} surface adhesive forces and it rises {{above the water}} table (the zero-gauge-pressure isobar) by capillary action to saturate a small zone above the phreatic surface (the capillary fringe) at less than atmospheric pressure. This is termed tension saturation and {{is not the same as}} saturation on a water-content basis. Water content in a capillary fringe decreases with increasing distance from the phreatic surface. The capillary head depends on soil pore size. In sandy soils with larger pores, the head will be less than in clay soils with very small pores. The normal capillary rise in a clayey soil is less than 1.80 m (six feet) but can range between 0.3 and 10 m (one and 30ft).|$|E

2500|$|It {{was first}} {{demonstrated}} at Oakengates on a now lost {{section of the}} Shropshire Canal in 1792, where its inventor, [...] Robert Weldon (b:?1754 to d:1810) built a half-scale model. He claimed that his design would {{solve the problem of}} water supply in dry seasons or at greater elevations, be cheaper than building aqueducts or tunnels, and be quicker to operate than the number of surface locks his design could replace. [...] He patented his invention as the 'Hydrostatick Caisson Lock'. [...] The full-sized box, or [...] "trunk", would probably have displaced about 270tonnes and weighed about 170tonnes, including the water in it, so about 100tonnes of ballast would have been needed to give neutral buoyancy. [...] The box would have needed to be strong enough to withstand the pressure of 50feet (15m) of water i.e. about 3,000lbf/ftÂ² (150 kPa) <b>gauge</b> <b>pressure</b> {{at the bottom of the}} chamber.|$|E
2500|$|Acetylene is not {{especially}} toxic but, when generated from calcium carbide, it can contain toxic impurities such as traces of phosphine and arsine, which {{give it a}} distinct garlic-like smell [...] It is also highly flammable, as most light hydrocarbons, hence its use in welding. Its most singular hazard is associated with its intrinsic instability, especially when it is pressurized: under certain conditions acetylene can react in an exothermic addition-type reaction to form a number of products, typically benzene and/or vinylacetylene, possibly in addition to carbon and hydrogen [...] Consequently, acetylene, if initiated by intense heat or a shockwave, can decompose explosively if the absolute pressure of the gas exceeds about [...] Most regulators and pressure gauges on equipment report <b>gauge</b> <b>pressure</b> and the safe limit for acetylene therefore is 101 kPagage or 15 psig. It is therefore supplied and stored dissolved in acetone or dimethylformamide (DMF), contained in a gas cylinder with a porous filling (Agamassan), which renders it safe to transport and use, given proper handling. Acetylene cylinders {{should be used in}} the upright position to avoid withdrawing acetone during use.|$|E
