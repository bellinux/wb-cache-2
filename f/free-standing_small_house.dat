40|$|A 1755 advert in the Gloucester Journal {{listed for}} sale, ‘A MODERN-BUILT HOUSE, with four rooms on a floor, {{fit for a}} gentleman’. In the late-seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, ‘gentlemen’s houses’ like the one {{described}} evolved as a cultural norm. This thesis offers a social and cultural reading of an under-studied group of <b>small</b> <b>free-standing</b> classical <b>houses</b> built in the west of England between 1680 and 1770. By developing a profile of eighty-one gentlemen’s houses and one hundred and thirty-four builders and owners, this study unites subjects such as the history of architecture, landscapes, domestic interiors, objects and social development that are often treated separately. The design, spatial arrangement, and furnishings of gentlemen’s houses precisely defined the position of their builders and owners in the social hierarchy. The 1720 s marked an important shift in the location and meaning of building that corresponded to an alteration {{in the background of}} builders. <b>Small</b> classical <b>houses</b> moved from a relatively novel form of building for the gentry to a conventional choice made by newcomers often from commercial and professional backgrounds. Gentlemen’s houses projected status in a range of settings for both landed and non-landed elites, highlighting the house as a form of status-enhancing property rather than land. Moreover, gentlemen’s houses had adaptable interior spaces and were furnished with an array of objects that differed in number and quality from those lower and higher in society. The connections between gentlemen’s houses and important processes of social change in Britain are striking. House-building and furnishing were measured strategic activities that calibrated social status and illustrated mobility. This thesis demonstrates that gentlemen’s houses are one key to understanding the permeability of the English elite as well as the combination of dynamism and stability that characterized eighteenth-century English society.

40|$|The prehistoric {{cultural}} landscape of Chaco Canyon {{is made up}} of monumental great <b>houses</b> and <b>small</b> <b>houses.</b> The Chaco Canyon architectural record has been extensively studied, yet the relationship between great and <b>small</b> <b>houses</b> remains a fundamental problem of Southwest archaeology. By using space syntax access analyses, I examine in this research the spatial organisation of great and <b>small</b> <b>houses</b> and compare the two structures in terms of form and function. Space syntax is used to analyse twenty <b>small</b> <b>houses</b> and eleven discrete room blocks from three great houses. Access graphs are constructed and used to generate syntactic data. These data are examined by: (1) exploratory data analyses to identify temporal patterning in spatial integration and control; (2) difference factor analyses; (3) the identification of spatial phenotypes; and (4) analyses of inequality or functional genotypes. Statistically significant differences among integration values for both <b>small</b> and great <b>houses</b> over time are demonstrated. Difference factor analyses identify a robust spatial structure for <b>small</b> <b>houses.</b> This strong structure is a result of differences in spatial integration between built space and built form, and between spatial functions. Great houses are found to have a much weaker spatial structure. The results of this research are used to evaluate the spatial implications of the currently proposed Chaco great house models. Syntactical analyses suggest that it is unlikely that any one model fits all the great <b>houses.</b> The <b>small</b> <b>houses</b> appear domestic in nature and organisation. However, there is also evidence that not all <b>small</b> <b>houses</b> are equal: functional specialisation may be present. Examining the social and spatial relationships of kivas and mealing bin rooms at both great and <b>small</b> <b>houses</b> seems a promising avenue for future inquiry. ...|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{benefits}} mentioned here above, the <b>small</b> <b>house</b> policy does {{create a lot}} of controversies, which can also be divided into three categories. First of all, the <b>Small</b> <b>House</b> Policy is fundamentally unsustainable. There was already over 14157 outstanding <b>small</b> <b>house</b> grant applications received until 2002, yet the number of potential applicants, who are eligible indigenous male villagers at least 18, is still increasing. It was estimated that the number of indigenous villagers with entitlements was going to reach 240000. In other words, if all of these 240000 entitled villagers were going to apply for <b>small</b> <b>houses,</b> there would be a significant uptake of over 2,200 hectares of Hong Kong’s valuable land resources. However, there is a dwindling supply of land in village areas to develop <b>small</b> <b>houses.</b> The imbalance of supply of land and demand for <b>small</b> <b>houses</b> will remain a major problem of the <b>Small</b> <b>House</b> Policy. Secondly, the speculative development develops within the <b>Small</b> <b>House</b> Policy framework is found to have gotten more serious. The Audit Commission in 1987 realized the phenomenon that the indigenous villagers kept selling their <b>small</b> <b>houses</b> to the outsiders. The situation has even been more frequent since 2002. On top of the abusive use of this policy, there are some indigenous villagers who are intentionally recruited by private landowners to sell their rights of ownership. According to Lands Department of Hong Kong, indigenous villagers need to sign up a security document, which is to prevent them from taking full advantages of their title to the lot. Yet, there are a significant number of people make declarations, which are in fact misrepresenting their true intentions. They apply for the removal of restriction on alienation while assigning the <b>small</b> <b>houses</b> to the developers so that they can gain benefits from selling their rights. There is also another form of abuse. Although villagers living overseas are not allowed to apply for a small house,it is in fact difficult to determine if the application was made with a local address. Apart from those controversies regarding the actual exercise of the policy, the nature of the policy is also greatly disputed. The <b>Small</b> <b>House</b> Policy is discriminatory against two groups of people. First of all, the policy was designed to offer male indigenous villagers exclusively a right to apply for <b>small</b> <b>houses.</b> This totally discriminates against the female indigenous villagers, as they are not allowed to apply for a <b>small</b> <b>house</b> grant. Indeed, the nature of The <b>Small</b> <b>House</b> Policy has been criticized since 1995. The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights had released a report, mentioning that they were having great concerns about the sexual discrimination that the <b>Small</b> <b>House</b> Policy may potentially involve. The Equal Opportunities Commission had also noticed the case, describing that the policy was actually violating the human right ordinances applied in Hong Kong, i.e. the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance. More importantly, the policy is not only violating the rights of women but also the non-indigenous Hong Kong residents. It is argued that the principle of equal rights should be or can be applied in Hong Kong; it should protect all the citizens of Hong Kong. Therefore, it is unfair that indigenous villagers enjoy an exclusive right to build houses, especially when Hong Kong is having serious land scarcity.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the <b>small</b> <b>house</b> concept ?in Zimbabwe focusing on economically independent women s motives {{for engaging in}} sexual relationships with married men. ?<b>Small</b> <b>house</b> is a colloquial and derogatory term that describes a married man s quasi-polygamous, informal, long term, secret sexual relationship with another woman. General public and private discourse conceptualises the <b>small</b> <b>house</b> as survival transactional sex and as a key driver of Zimbabwe s HIV epidemic. Consequently, public health campaigns educate people {{about the dangers of}} <b>small</b> <b>housing</b> as part of multiple concurrent partnerships and sexual networks discourses linked to the HIV epidemic. While economic inequalities between genders exist globally, narrow focused frameworks embedded in health and poverty discourses do injustice to the diversity and complexity of sex research. Pinning women s motivations for engaging in ?small-houses to lack of empowerment, sexual agency and poverty excludes some categories of seemingly ?low-risk women including the educated, economically stable, high socio-economic status women who knowingly and ?willingly engage in these highly stigmatized sexual relationships. Such approaches to the <b>small</b> <b>house</b> phenomenon neglect the intricacies and complex interconnections between sexual intimacy, desires, economic strategising and political manoeuvring. My research investigated this complexity through exploring the meanings these women attach to being <b>small</b> <b>houses</b> and their experiences in these relationships as they are intertwined with broader changing social, economic, political and cultural contexts in which they are located.
