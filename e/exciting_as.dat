5|$|Several {{critics and}} {{publications}} ranked Coexist {{as one of}} 2012's best albums in their year-end, top-ten lists, including Kitty Empire of The Observer, The Austin Chronicle, Les Inrockuptibles, State magazine, and The Guardian, whose staff voted it eighth. It was named the 14th best {{album of the year}} by both NME magazine and Christgau in his list for The Barnes & Noble Review. However, the magazine XLR8R ranked the album number seven on their list of the most overrated releases of the year, feeling that the trio's dark and minimal sound on the record was not as <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> on their debut LP.|$|E

25|$|Indonesia has {{rich and}} diverse culinary traditions, {{and might be}} {{considered}} {{as one of the}} richest and the best in the world; such as rendang that recently voted as the number one dish of CNN International 'World's 50 Most Delicious Foods' list. Many regional cuisines exist, often based upon indigenous culture and foreign influences. Indonesian cuisine varies greatly by region and has many different influences. From succulent coconut-milk and curry rich Minangkabau cuisine to Oceanian seafood meal of Papuan and Ambonese cuisine. Embarked on a journey through Indonesian cuisine is as <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> enjoying the diversity of Indonesian culture, as some kind of dishes might have myriad variations of different recipes across archipelago.|$|E
25|$|Parcells led the Giants to {{a second}} Super Bowl in 1990. The Giants began the 1990 season 10–0, and {{finished}} 13–3, but lost Simms to injury late in the season. Playing with a back-up quarterback in Jeff Hostetler and a 33-year-old veteran running back in Ottis Anderson, the Giants convincingly defeated the Chicago Bears in the divisional playoff, 31–3, and won in dramatic, come-from-behind fashion over San Francisco, 15–13, in the NFC Championship on a last-second 42-yard field goal by Matt Bahr which {{was set up by}} a Roger Craig fumble caused by nose tackle Erik Howard. Super Bowl XXV proved equally <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> the Giants used tough defense, and a ball-control and power-running Erhardt – Perkins style offense to stop the Buffalo Bills, 20–19, whose own last-second 47-yard field goal attempt by Scott Norwood missed wide right. Parcells retired from football after Super Bowl XXV due to health problems.|$|E

And that's what's so <b>exciting.</b> <b>As</b> you get older, you get better.... Look at all these incredible women, like Vanessa Redgrave, who are still so beautiful.

500|$|William Trevor, {{writing in}} The Listener, was dismissive of the work, {{thinking}} that [...] "Bond continues to behave {{with so little}} originality that neither Templar nor Drummond, Marlowe nor Nick Charles, would have paused to waste a pellet on him"; he continued, saying that [...] "this present work is once again a fantasy for grown-up children, neither as clever nor <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> the early thrillers of Edgar Wallace or the boys adventure stories of fifty years ago." [...] Trevor did admit that [...] "for those who like to escape to Bondsville, the old boom-town hasn't changed a scrap." ...|$|E
500|$|The writers {{began to}} adapt [...] "In Thy Image" [...] into a film script, but the script was not {{completed}} until {{four months after}} production commenced. Wise felt that the story was sound, but the action and visuals could be made more <b>exciting.</b> <b>As</b> the intended start of filming in late spring 1978 approached, it was clear a new start date was needed. Time was of the essence; Paramount was worried that their science fiction film would appear {{at the tail end}} of a cycle, now that every major studio had such a film in the works. Livingston described the writers' issue with the story, calling it [...] "unworkable": ...|$|E
500|$|The game {{received}} [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews, {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. Gamezebo named the title {{among the best}} mobile games released in June 2015. Reviewers praised the cleverness and minimalism of its puzzle design, but wanted more variety from its activity-dense scenarios. They noted how they came to know the characters intimately after memorizing each character's routes and remembering how they respond to different kinds of coaxing. This predictability felt great, the TouchArcade reviewer wrote, when he could instinctively respond to new combinations of targets, but as a trade-off, the game mechanics quickly became repetitive. The Gamezebo reviewer felt otherwise, and commended how the game's setting, despite its consistency, remained fresh and <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> new targets and complications were added. Pocket Gamer reviewer found the game's alternative methods for killing targets through [...] "traps and tricks" [...] to be the game's most interesting element.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{his career}} Britten {{was drawn to}} the song cycle form. In 1928, when he was 14, he {{composed}} an orchestral cycle, Quatre chansons françaises, setting words by Victor Hugo and Paul Verlaine. Brett comments that though the work is much influenced by Wagner {{on the one hand and}} French mannerisms on the other, [...] "the diatonic nursery-like tune for the sad boy with the consumptive mother in 'L'enfance' is entirely characteristic". After he came under Auden's influence Britten composed Our Hunting Fathers (1936), ostensibly a protest against fox-hunting but which also alludes allegorically to the contemporary political state of Europe. The work has never been popular; in 1948 the critic Colin Mason lamented its neglect and called it one of Britten's greatest works. In Mason's view the cycle is [...] "as <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> Les Illuminations, and offers many interesting and enjoyable foretastes of the best moments of his later works." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Christopher Connelly, {{a writer for}} Rolling Stone, described [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin" [...] as being Thrillers [...] "most combative track". Connelly noted that in the [...] "hyperactive" [...] song, Jackson's [...] "emotions are so raw that the song nearly goes out of control". He further commented that the song has a [...] "tune that's almost as <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> seeing Jackson motivate himself across a concert stage – {{and a lot more}} unpredictable". Remarking that while the song's lyrics [...] "won't keep Elvis Costello awake nights [...] ", they [...] "do show that Jackson has progressed past the hey-let's-hustle sentiments that dominated Off the Wall". He added that Jackson's [...] "raw ability and conviction make material like", citing [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin", as well as other of Thrillers songs, [...] "into first-class cuts".|$|E
500|$|In 2004, [...] "Trapped in the Sky" [...] was re-issued on Region 1 DVD {{as part of}} A Video's release The Best of Thunderbirds: The Favorite Episodes, whose {{content was}} {{selected}} {{based on the results}} of a fan poll hosted on the A website. Reviewing the product for DVD Verdict, David Gutierrez awarded [...] "Trapped in the Sky" [...] a grade of 95 (out of 100), commending the episode for the rescue itself (considered [...] "amazing") and adding: [...] "Television rarely has moments as <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> the Fireflash attempting a forced landing." [...] Stuart Galbraith IV of the DVD Talk website characterised the plot as [...] "sort of an airborne version of Speed". In a BBC Online review of the 2003 Thunderbirds soundtrack album, Morag Reavley commented positively on composer Barry Gray's incidental piece [...] "Fireflash Landing", stating that it is one of several [...] "catchy, pulse-quickening tunes" [...] that [...] "come fast and furious".|$|E

500|$|The game's release {{has been}} {{regarded}} as important {{in the history of}} the console RPG. Kohler noted that Toriyama's and Sugiyama's contributions to the game [...] "made Dragon Quest as visually and aurally <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> the game play was unique and sophisticated." [...] GameSpot named it as one of the fifteen most influential titles in video game history. IGN listed it as the eighth best all-time NES game. In 2005, it listed it as the 92nd-best all-time video game, and in 2007 it listed the game as the 29th best. Nintendo Power rated Dragon Warrior as the 140th-best game made for the Nintendo System in its Top200 Games list in 2006. IGN reviewed the game years later and gave it a 7.8 out of 10, and RPGamer's Bill Johnson gave it a 4 out of 5 overall score. The NES' localization received considerable praise for adding extra characters and depth to the story. The removal of the stylized dialogue in the GBC remake has similarly been lamented.|$|E
500|$|In April 1958 Fleming {{flew to the}} Seychelles via Bombay {{to report}} for The Sunday Times on a {{treasure}} hunt; although the hunt was not as <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> he hoped, Fleming used many {{of the details of}} the island for [...] "The Hildebrand Rarity". Fleming combined the backdrop of the Seychelles with his experience he and Blanche Blackwell had undergone when they had visited Pedro Keys, two islands off Jamaica, and watched two scientists do something similar with poison to obtain samples. For the villain of the story, an abusive American millionaire, Fleming used the name Milton Krest: Milton was the code name of a Greek sea captain who ferried British soldiers and agents through German patrols and who received the Distinguished Service Order and an MBE, whilst Krest was the name of tonic and ginger beer Fleming drank in Seychelles. [...] "The Hildebrand Rarity" [...] was first published in Playboy in March 1960.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} Conan was released, {{the media were}} {{inclined}} to condemn Hollywood's portrayals of violence; typical action films showed the hero attaining his goals by killing all who stood in his way. [...] Conan was particularly condemned for its violent scenes, which Newsweeks Jack Kroll called [...] "cheerless and styleless". [...] In one of his articles for the San Francisco Chronicle, Stu Schreiberg counted 50people killed in various scenes. [...] Other film critics differed over the film's portrayal of violence. [...] David Denby wrote in his review for New York magazine that the action scenes {{were one of the}} film's few positive features; however, <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> the scenes were, those such as the decapitation of Conan's mother seemed inane. [...] On the other hand, Vincent Canby, Carlos Clarens, and Pascal Mérigeau were unanimous in their opinion that the film's depicted violence failed to meet their expectations: the film's pacing and Howard's stories suggested more gory material. [...] According to Paul Sammon, Milius's cuts to assuage concerns over the violence made the scenes [...] "cartoon-like".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} strong {{praise from}} fans, who [...] "demanded the show won an award". In August 2017, the helicopter crash was longlisted for Best Drama Storyline at the Inside Soap Awards. The nomination made the viewer-voted shortlist. On 6 November 2017, the helicopter crash won the [...] "Best Drama Storyline" [...] accolade. Radio Times reported that viewers were left [...] "stunned" [...] by the episode, while Digital Spy stated that fans {{were left in}} [...] "shock and awe" [...] over the episode. The Daily Mirror reporter Sharon Marshall praised the episode, branding it as a [...] "pitch-perfect episode mixing gore, heartache, drama and nostalgia". Marshall added that the episode [...] "showcased what Casualty does best – beautiful writing and a stellar cast who grab your heartstrings," [...] before concluding her review by praising the episode as {{being able to make}} the show [...] "look as fresh and <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> the day it was born." [...] However, the show also received criticism, with the episode being branded [...] "insensitive" [...] by the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} of Scarface was troubled from the start. The Hays office warned Howard Hughes, the film's producer, {{not to make}} the film. He ignored their pleas telling Hawks: [...] "Screw the Hays Office. Start the picture and make it as realistic, as <b>exciting,</b> <b>as</b> grisly as possible." [...] When the film was completed in late 1931, the Hays office demanded numerous changes, including a conclusion where Camonte was captured, tried, convicted, and hung, and demanded the film carry the subtitle Shame of a Nation. Hughes sent the picture to numerous state censorship boards, saying that he hoped to show the film was made to combat the [...] "gangster menace". After failing to get the film past the New York State censor board (then headed by Wingate) even after the changes, Hughes decided to release the movie in a version close to its original form. When other local censors refused to release the edited version, the Hays Office sent Jason Joy around to ensure them that the cycle of gangster films of this nature was coming to an end.|$|E
500|$|John Madden Football '93 was a {{commercial}} success, with {{over one million}} copies sold. It has been cited as the highest-selling game developed by Looking Glass Studios, and Neurath later called it [...] "one {{of the most successful}} games I've ever worked on". Paul Mellerick of Mega commented that [...] "the only noticeable difference between [...] and its two predecessors is the animation". He wrote that this new animation [...] "makes the game incredibly good to look at" [...] and that new motions like stumbling increase the game's difficulty. Although he believed that the [...] "two-player mode is just as <b>exciting</b> <b>as</b> ever", he was disappointed by the lack of a full-season mode, which he called [...] "unforgivable" [...] in light of this feature's appearance in Sega's NFL Sports Talk Football '93. He concluded that John Madden Football '93 was [...] "the best game the Mega Drive has to offer", but he wrote, [...] "If you own John Madden Football '92, or even the original John Madden American Football for that matter, then you should ignore this game completely".|$|E
