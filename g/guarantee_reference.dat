40|$|A fully digital, non-linear, wide bandwidth, current {{controller}} for DC-AC and DC-DC {{voltage source}} converters {{is presented in}} this paper. Exploiting oversampling, the controller mimics an analog hysteresis current controller, but does not employ analog comparators and digital to analog converters. Indeed, it fully virtualizes the hysteresis controller’s operation and, based only on a non linear, efficient, current error filter algorithm, determines the optimum switching instants for the power converter that <b>guarantee</b> <b>reference</b> tracking with minimum delay. In addition, it overcomes the typical limitations of conventional hysteretic controllers, i. e. variable switching frequency or, when frequency stabilization is implemented, sensitiveness to switch dead times and sampling delays. Overall, it offers the same dynamic performance of the analog hysteresis controller, but eliminates all the related issues. Because the current error sample processing algorithm is inherently parallel in structure, the controller is suited for VHDL synthesis and FPGA implementation, which guarantees flexibility and low cost. Its intended application areas include active filters, uninterruptible power supplies, microgrid distributed energy resource (DER) controllers, laboratory battery testers, welding machines...|$|E
40|$|This book {{introduces}} non-identifier-based {{adaptive control}} (with and without internal model) and {{its application to}} the current, speed and position control of mechatronic systems such as electrical synchronous machines, wind turbine systems, industrial servo systems, and rigid-link, revolute-joint robots. In mechatronics, there is often only rough knowledge of the system. Due to parameter uncertainties, nonlinearities and unknown disturbances, model-based control strategies can reach their performance or stability limits without iterative controller design and performance evaluation, or system identification and parameter estimation. The non-identifier-based adaptive control presented is an alternative that neither identifies the system nor estimates its parameters but ensures stability. The adaptive controllers are easy to implement, compensate for disturbances and are inherently robust to parameter uncertainties and nonlinearities. For controller implementation only structural system knowledge (like relative degree, input-to-state stable zero dynamics and known sign of the high-frequency gain) is required. Moreover, the presented controllers <b>guarantee</b> <b>reference</b> tracking with prescribed asymptotic or transient accuracy, i. e. the tracking error eventually tends to or for all time evolves within an a priori specified region.

In this article we want to underline the fact that standardization {{is only one of the}} most important coordination processes within organizations, and two other processes are needed: coordination by plan and coordination by mutual adaptation. All these three coordination processes should be seriously taken into account within a knowledge management systems, allowing different strategies of meaning coordination processes. In particular, we propose an approach to meaning coordination that is based upon the adoption of a formal ontology as a means for managing the coordination itself. In practice, the approach requires that a centralised formal ontology have to sustain three different processes that reflect the organizational coordination processes: (i) <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>reference</b> to unique definitions (standardization of concepts), (ii) leaving the individuals of the organization free to use their own terms, with specific meanings (coordination by plan), (iii) allowing the individuals to continuously negotiate meanings and create their own ontology from scratch (mutual adaptation that takes place when the coordination between two or more subjects attempt at sharing the meaning of a single term). Finally, the paper underlines how a particular meaning negotiation process is correlated to the organizational coordination processes, which depend on the type of production, processes and technologies that are used within the firm...|$|R

40|$|It is {{the aim of}} {{this thesis}} to {{consider}} two accounts of 1 st-person utterances that are often mistakenly conflated - viz. that involving the 'no-reference' view of "I", and that of the non-assertoric thesis of avowals. The first account says that in a large range of (roughly) 'psychological' uses, 'I' is not a referring expression; the second, that avowals of 1 st-personal 'immediate' experience are primarily 'expressive' and not genuine assertions. The two views are expressions of what I term 'Trojanism'. This viewpoint constitutes one side of a 'Homeric Opposition in the Metaphysics of Experience', and has been endorsed by Wittgenstein throughout his writings; it has received recent expression in Professor Anscombe's article 'The First Person'. I explore the ideas of these writers in some depth, and consider to what extent they stand up to criticism by such notable 'Greek' contenders as P. F. Strawson and Gareth Evans. I first give neutral accounts of the key-concepts on which subsequent arguments are based. These are the immunity to error through misidentification (IEM) of certain 1 st-person utterances, the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>reference</b> of 'I', avowal, and the Generality Constraint. I consider the close relation of Trojanism to solipsism and behaviourism, and then assess the effectiveness of two arguments for that viewpoint - Anscombe's Tank Argument and the argument from IEM. Though each is appealing, neither is decisive; to assess Trojanism properly {{we need to look at}} the non-assertoric thesis of avowals, which alone affords the prospect of a resolution of the really intractable problems of the self generated by Cartesianism. In the course of the latter assessment I consider the different varieties of avowal, broadening the discussion beyond the over-used example 'I am in pain'. I explore Wittgenstein's notion of 'expression', and discuss how this notion may help to explain the authority a subject possesses on his mental states as expressed in avowals. My conclusion is that an expressive account of avowals can provide a satisfactory counter to the Cartesian account of authority without our needing recourse to a non-assertoric or even to a non- cognitive thesis. Discussion of self-consciousness is implicit in discussion of the Homeric Opposition, but there is in addition a short chapter on the concept itself...|$|R

The proposed controller, denoted as the adaptive SPR/LTR controller, combines a baseline observer-based design with loop transfer recovery (LTR) properties and an adaptive design based on strictly positive real (SPR) transfer functions. In addition to accommodating the absence of full state measurements, the controller includes a reference model that also plays the role of an observer through a closed-loop component.

40|$|In Being Known (1999), Peacocke {{supports}} that a property-identity link is constitutive of {{the understanding of}} past-tense utterances. Such a link is {{the one with the}} property which is required to be for an analogue present-tense utterance to be true. My thesis, Partial Indifference, is that the link in question is only the one with the property which is required to be for an analogue tenseless utterance to be true. In this paper, I defend partial indifference by way of two arguments. Firstly, according to partial indifference a property-identity link entail trivially a truth-value link, and it is not explained by Peacocke's property-identity link. Secondly, partial indifference eliminates any mention of the present as at the level of reference as at the level of sense, and thus it <b>guarantees</b> a constant <b>reference</b> to the past...|$|R
