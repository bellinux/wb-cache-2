25|$|Discounting to face value: Before {{national}} currencies {{and efficient}} clearing houses, banknotes were only redeemable {{at face value}} at the issuing bank. Even a branch bank could <b>discount</b> <b>notes</b> of other branches of the same bank. The discounts usually increased with distance from the issuing bank. The discount also depended on the perceived safety of the bank. When banks failed the notes were usually partly redeemed out of reserves, but sometimes became worthless.

50|$|Moore {{believed}} that judicial decisions often reflected norms of commercial behavior rather than judicial precedent, and he therefore sought {{to establish a}} body of factual empirical data {{as the basis of}} legal studies. In a famous 1929 study, An Institutional Approach to the Law of Commercial Banking, Moore and co-author Theodore S. Hope, Jr. attempted to explain banking law judicial decisions that did not appear to derive from existing legal rules (lex lata). The authors examined banks’ then common use of what were considered to be questionable practices and found that courts upheld a bank’s practice when it was in conformance with the practice of other banks in the area, even though it deviated from hypothetical “normal banking practice.” In later articles with Gilbert Sussman, Moore undertook an empirical survey of actual banking practices in <b>discounting</b> <b>notes.</b> Moore’s empirical emphasis in legal research characterized the body of his work.|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the application of}} a quadratic programming model to the bond and note participation decision of a Cooperative Farm Credit Bank. The model generates an efficient frontier of bond and note portfolios from which a bank can choose. The composition of these portfolios depends upon the expected cost and variance-covariance of cost for the bond and note activities, debt needs, and the debt policy constraints of a bank. The results indicate that the interest rate risk of various bond and note issues should be considered when making debt participation decisions. The Cooperative Farm Credit System has become a major supplier of credit to agricul-ture. On January 1, 1980, the 37 banks of the System collectively extended in excess of $ 48 billion to agriculture. This entailed 36 per-cent of all farm real estate debt and 25 per-cent of all farm nonreal estate debt. The System obtains funds for loans from the na-tional money market by issuing system-wide consolidated bonds and <b>discount</b> <b>notes.</b> The interest cost on bonds and notes depends upon market interest rates which have been very volatile in recent years and are not controllable by the System [Bildersee]. In order to obtain sufficient funds, the System must be willing to offer investors competitive rates.

30|$|In Fig. 8, we {{consider}} {{a set of}} eight consumers with various load demands. The first subplot illustrates the consumers’ energy consumption scheduling actions with and without the proposed protocol deployment. With the deployment of the protocol, consumers tend to consume less energy in peak hours. At the same time, their individual utilities are increased as illustrated in the second subplot. This is because the energy cost is smaller, and hence, the bills charged to consumers are smaller. The third subplot further shows the prices with respect to various <b>discount</b> factors. <b>Note</b> that the price {{is proportional to the}} energy cost. Therefore, the lower the price is, the more energy-efficient the system is. When the consumers value more the future utilities (i.e., the discount factor is larger), consumers tend to schedule less energy consumption in peak hours, and therefore, the price is also lower.|$|R

In reality, insurers may pay more attention to their future finite-time risks, especially in the investment period, for example, one year, and can rearrange the investment strategy. So, a definition of VaR based on finite-time discounted net loss is a more realistic risk measurement.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{develops}} hedonic {{analyses of}} the pricing of leasehold versus freehold estates in Ghana. The motivation of {{the paper is the}} passage of Act 267 (5) in 1992 that effectively abolished outright sale of stool lands in Ghana. Stool lands are lands controlled by tribal "chiefs. " Act 267 (5) prohibits the sale of freehold estates for stool lands. There are two important findings in this study. The first is that freeholds tend to attract premium prices relative to leaseholds. This supports the bundle-of-rights argument. The second is that the effect of the 1992 Act is indeed capitalized into land prices because of the relative increase in the supply of leaseholds vis-à-vis freeholds. Specifically, the price of freeholds increased relative to the price of leaseholds after the constitutional event. The study also finds that transactions involving stools and individuals, usually perceived to be associated with litigation risk (or title insecurity) relative to government lands, are sold at a <b>discount.</b> Transactions <b>noted</b> to have a history of litigation are also associated with price discounts. The estimated coefficients on all the variables representing services to the site like water, electricity and access roads are significantly positive, indicating a high demand for such essential services.
