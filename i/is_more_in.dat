His two-seamer is his most-used pitch against right-handed hitters and is used more frequently than against lefties, as is his slider. His changeup is only thrown to left-handed hitters. Greinke's curveball is typically used early in the count, while his slider is his most common 2-strike pitch.|$|E
5|$|Some {{residents}} of Glenwood Springs have argued instead that CDOT should instead build a bypass that avoids downtown completely, {{as it did}} in Basalt.

The bypass, they claim, <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> keeping with the wishes of residents and would cost less. They have lobbied Glenwood Springs' city council to be more active in pressuring CDOT to reconsider the bypass.|$|E

Still owing Penguin Publishing two more Red Dwarf novels, Grant and Naylor decided to each write an alternative sequel to Better than Life. Two completely different sequels were made as a result, each presenting a possible version of the story's continuation. Last Human, by Doug Naylor, adds Kochanski to the crew and places more emphasis on the science-fiction and plot elements, while Rob Grant's novel Backwards, <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> keeping with the previous two novels, and borrows more extensively from established television stories.|$|E

5|$|The {{power of}} the Aksumite Kingdom {{declined}} after the 6th century due {{to the rise of}} other regional states in the Horn of Africa. Modern scholars continue to debate the identity and provenance of the legendary or semi-legendary figure Gudit (fl. 10th century), a queen who is traditionally believed to have overthrown the Kingdom of Aksum. The legend is found in the 13th-century chronicle of the monk Tekle Haymanot, who compiled historical writings gathered from various Ethiopian churches and monasteries. The chronicle alleges that, after being exiled from Axum, she married a Jewish king of Syria and converted to Judaism. The Scottish travel writer James Bruce (1730–1794) was incredulous about the tale and believed she was simply a Jewish queen. Carlo Conti Rossini (1872–1949) hypothesized that she was an ethnic Sidamo from Damot, whereas Steven Kaplan argues she was a non-Christian invader and historian Knud Tage Andersen contends she was a regular member of the Aksumite royal house who shrewdly seized the throne. The latter <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> line with another legend that claims Dil Na'od, the last king of Aksum, kept his daughter Mesobe Werq in isolation out of fear of a prophecy that her son would overthrow him, yet she eloped with the nobleman Mara Takla Haymanot from Lasta who eventually killed the Aksumite king in a duel, took the throne and founded the Zagwe dynasty. The latter {{remains one of the most}} poorly understood periods of Ethiopia's recorded history. What is known is that the early Zagwe kings were polytheistic, eventually converted to Christianity, and ruled over the northern Highlands of Ethiopia, while Islamic sultanates inhabited the coastal Ethiopian Lowlands.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Telangana {{state in}} {{southern}} India has many areas which have high–low fluoride levels in drinking water, and Mahabubnagar district is one among them, {{where people are}} affected with dental and skeletal fluorosis, with the majority belonging to low socio-economic status. Aims: To assess the prevalence of dental fluorosis in school going children of Mahabubnagar district and also to assess fluoride levels in drinking water from different areas of Mahabubnagar district. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 2000 children in the age group 6 – 12 years in different areas of Mahabubnagar district. Dental fluorosis status was assessed by using Modified Dean’s Fluorosis Index. Alizarin visual method was used to estimate fluoride levels in water. The data collected were subjected to statistical analysis. Results: Dental fluorosis in primary and permanent dentition was 15 and 70. 3 %, respectively. In {{the northern part of}} Mahabubnagar district, primary dentition <b>was</b> <b>more</b> affected by fluorosis whereas in southern part, the permanent dentition <b>was</b> <b>more</b> affected. The prevalence of dental fluorosis <b>in</b> primary dentition <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> 6 – 7 -year-old children (35. 5 %), and in permanent dentition, it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> 9 – 10 -year-old children (70 %). The fluoride level <b>in</b> drinking water <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> Kosghi, Kalwakurthy (2. 0 [*]ppm). Conclusion: Dental fluorosis <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> 10 -year-old and less in 6 -year-old children. It <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> eastern and northern zones of Mahabubnagar district and less in local villages of Mahabubnagar...|$|R

25|$|The {{issue of}} {{circular}} migration {{and its relation}} to development is especially relevant today. First, understanding the importance of transnationalism and the temporary and repetitive movement of migrants between countries has facilitated new thinking, specifically with regards to remittances and organized labor schemes. Second, the “win-win-win” discourse is being considered seriously as a potential option for development to provide benefits for all parties involved. Third, in the current political climate many parts of the developed world are against migration, so circular migration is an option that policy makers believe <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> touch with public opinion. Lastly, advances in technology have enabled government officials to monitor migrants as they move between their home and host countries.|$|E

25|$|Inconsistency, vagueness, {{and a lack}} of {{specifics}} in both English language translations {{and modern}} English language interpretations of Leibniz's writings render a clear exposition difficult.

The second point of view <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> tune with Couturat's views as expressed above, which emphasize science and engineering.

25|$|Another unusual {{variant of}} the {{saxophone}} is the Conn-O-Sax, a straight-conical bore instrument in F (one step above the E alto) with a slightly curved neck and spherical bell. This instrument, which combines a saxophone bore and keys with a bell shaped {{similar to that of}} a heckelphone, was intended to imitate the timbre of the English horn and was produced only in 1929 and 1930. The instrument has a key range from low A to high G. Fewer than 100 Conn-O-Saxes are in existence, and they are highly sought by collectors. More recently a mezzo-soprano in the key of G has been produced by Danish woodwind technician Peter Jessen, most notably played by Joe Lovano.

There are certainly no beam ceilings, low narrow doorways or inglenook fireplaces heating small rooms: the large airy rooms are in fact more redolent of the 18th century than the 16th. Cragside is slightly more true to its theme, although the rooms are very large, some contain Tudor style panelling, and the dining room contains are monumental inglenook, but this <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>in</b> the style of Italian renaissance meets Camelot than Tudor.
