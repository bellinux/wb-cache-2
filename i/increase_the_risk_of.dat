25|$|A {{threshold}} value can be varied {{to make the}} test more restrictive or more sensitive, with the more restrictive tests <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> rejecting true positives, and the more sensitive tests <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> accepting false positives.|$|R
5|$|Excessive use {{of alcohol}} is also known to affect the {{metabolism}} of warfarin and can elevate the INR and thus <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> bleeding. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) product insert on warfarin states that alcohol should be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Parenting style {{seems to}} have no major effect, {{although}} people with supportive parents do better than those with critical or hostile parents. Childhood trauma, death of a parent, and being bullied or abused <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> psychosis. Living in an urban environment during childhood or as an adult has consistently been found to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> schizophrenia by a factor of two, even after taking into account drug use, ethnic group, and size of social group. Other factors that play an important role include social isolation and immigration related to social adversity, racial discrimination, family dysfunction, unemployment, and poor housing conditions.|$|E
5|$|Planning for dental {{implants}} {{focuses on}} the general health condition of the patient, the local health condition of the mucous membranes and the jaws and the shape, size, and position of {{the bones of the}} jaws, adjacent and opposing teeth. There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although there are certain conditions that can <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> failure. Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term steroid use, osteoporosis and other diseases that affect the bones can <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> early failure of implants.|$|E

5|$|Cancer, {{particularly}} when metastatic (spread {{to other places}} in the body), is a recognised risk factor for thrombosis. A number of mechanisms have been proposed, such as activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances. Furthermore, particular cancer treatments (such as the use of central venous catheters for chemotherapy) may <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> thrombosis further.|$|E
5|$|Diseases such as {{chlamydia}} and gonorrhoea {{are also}} important causes of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and subsequent infertility in women. Another important consequence of some STIs such as genital herpes and syphilis <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> acquiring HIV by three-fold, and can also influence its transmission progression. Worldwide, women and girls {{are at greater risk}} of HIV/AIDS. STIs are in turn associated with unsafe sexual activity that is often unconsensual.|$|E

5|$|Exposure to anticancer chemotherapy, in {{particular}} alkylating agents, can <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> subsequently developing AML.

Other chemotherapy agents, specifically epipodophyllotoxins and anthracyclines, have also been associated with treatment-related leukemias, which are often associated with specific chromosomal abnormalities in the leukemic cells.|$|E
5|$|Intense and {{prolonged}} exposure to workplace dusts, chemicals and fumes <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> COPD in both smokers and nonsmokers.

5|$|Long-term {{usage of}} non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{is associated with}} a reduced likelihood of developing AD.

5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} reports of associated risk factors for vertebral artery dissection; many of these reports suffer from methodological weaknesses, such as selection bias.

5|$|Treatment for {{hyperthermia}} includes reducing muscle overactivity via sedation with a benzodiazepine.
