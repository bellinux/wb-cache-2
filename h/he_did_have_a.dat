5|$|By the 1030s Malcolm's sons, {{if he had}} any, were dead. The only {{evidence}} that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> son or sons is in Rodulfus Glaber's chronicle where Cnut {{is said to have}} stood as godfather to a son of Malcolm. His grandson Thorfinn would have been unlikely to be accepted as king by the Scots, and he chose the sons of his other daughter, Bethóc, who was married to Crínán, lay abbot of Dunkeld, and perhaps Mormaer of Atholl. It may be no more than coincidence, but in 1027 the Irish annals had reported the burning of Dunkeld, although no mention is made of the circumstances. Malcolm's chosen heir, and the first tánaise ríg certainly known in Scotland, was Duncan.|$|E
25|$|Church left Gloucestershire, {{and senior}} cricket, after the 1998 season, {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> couple more minor outings several years later: one for Surrey Cricket Board in the 2002 ECB 38-County Cup {{and another for}} the Duke of Norfolk's XI against Ireland the following year; in both matches he made a duck, though he did manage one wicket in the earlier game.|$|E
25|$|Pepys and {{his wife}} took a holiday to France and the Low Countries in June–October 1669; on their return, Elisabeth fell ill and died on 10 November 1669. Pepys erected a {{monument}} {{to her in the}} church of St Olave's, Hart Street, London. Pepys never remarried, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> long-term housekeeper named Mary Skinner who was assumed by many of his contemporaries to be his mistress and sometimes referred to as Mrs. Pepys. In his will, he left her an annuity of £200 and many of his possessions.|$|E

25|$|Likewise Hyatt's batting never {{proved to}} be {{effective}} at first-class level, although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good run of form during the 1985-86 season. In that season he made his highest first-class score of 80, attempting to save a match against South Australia. In a match against Queensland {{towards the end of}} that season he wasn't bowled at all, giving the impression then Tasmanian captain Mark Ray had lost faith in him. He played his last match against Victoria at Devonport before being dropped from the side, and returning to grade cricket where he was more successful.|$|E
25|$|Asahifuji {{began his}} yokozuna career with 12 {{straight}} wins in the September 1990 tournament, but he lost to Kirishima on Day 13 and {{was defeated by}} Hokutoumi in the championship deciding bout on the final day. In November 1990 he finished runner-up again, to Chiyonofuji. In January and March 1991 he posted reasonable scores of 11–4 but was never really in contention for the championship in either tournament, although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> memorable win over the young rising star Takahanada in March. He {{had to wait until}} May 1991 for his first title as a yokozuna, when he defeated Konishiki twice on the last day, once in their regulation match and once in the playoff, to finish with a fine 14–1 record.|$|E
25|$|Filipescu {{was again}} in Bucharest during the {{resumption}} {{of war and the}} period leading up to Germany's surrender. His father had founded Epoca newspaper in 1885, and in September 1918, the son decided to revive the moribund outfit, buying the trademark from its nominal owner, Timoleon Pisani. Filipescu and Constantin Argetoianu identified two financiers, Aristide Blank and Jean Chrissoveloni. In exchange for backing from the latter two, the newspaper owners joined the administration of Marmorosch Blank Bank, alongside Duca, Toma Stelian, and Alexandru Vaida-Voevod. Blank's involvement would fuel the suspicions of antisemitic groups that the newspaper was a tool of the Jews. While Blank's influence was exaggerated, <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> say in the editorial policy. For instance, when an article critical of Liviu Rebreanu was slated to appear, the financier convinced Filipescu not to run the story. Instead, in 1919 Epoca published a dossier on Marghiloman's wartime stances.|$|E

25|$|After {{the short}} Presidency of Professor Harvey A. Neville (1960–1964), Dr. Willard Deming Lewis assumed office {{for what would}} be the longest Presidency at the University to date (1964–1982). With a {{background}} in physics and applied mathematics, and as an executive with Bell Laboratories, Dr. Lewis would go on to have one of the most successful, if unlikely, Presidencies. Though <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> strong predilection for, and understanding of, research, he had little previous experience with college teaching. Dr. Lewis oversaw women being first admitted as undergraduates, and he managed not only Bethlehem Steel's expansion on the Mountaintop (as it is now known), but also the company's aid in expanding the University's own campus. A major addition was placed along the north side, adjacent to the town, and in between the roads Morton St. and Packer Avenue. Formerly civilian homes, this area provided much needed space for libraries, laboratories, lecture halls, research, and the long anticipated home to the College of Arts and Science, Maginnes Hall.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, Alasdair Mór mac an Rígh, {{and called}} the Wolf of Badenoch (1343 – 20 June 1405), was the third {{surviving}} son of King Robert II of Scotland and youngest by his first wife, Elizabeth Mure of Rowallan. He was the first Earl of Buchan since John Comyn, from 1382 until his death. Alexander married the widowed Euphemia I, Countess of Ross, {{but they had no}} children although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> large family by his longtime mistress, Mairead inghean Eachann. Alexander was Justiciar of Scotia for a time, but not an effective one. He held large territories in the north of Scotland before eventually losing a large part of them. Alexander is remembered for his destruction of the royal burgh of Elgin and its cathedral. His nickname was earned due to his notorious cruelty and rapacity but there is no proof that it was used during his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Bleifer {{appeared}} {{in dozens of}} films during the 1930s, mostly in smaller un-credited roles, such as in Blood Money (1933), starring George Bancroft; Howard Hawks' 1937 war film The Road to Glory, starring Fredric March, Warner Baxter, and Lionel Barrymore; Ladies in Love, a 1936 romantic comedy starring Janet Gaynor, Constance Bennett, and Loretta Young; the romantic comedy The Baroness and the Butler (1938) starring William Powell and Annabella; and the comedy-drama Everything Happens at Night, starring Sonja Henning, Ray Milland, and Robert Cummings. <b>He</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> number of featured roles during the decade as well, including: as Dr. Alexander Dexter in Night Alarm, a 1934 drama; the role of Chenildieu in the 1935 version of Les Misérables, starring Fredric March and Charles Laughton; Ludwig in 1937's Charlie Chan at Monte Carlo, with Warner Oland in the title role; and as Wendling in the 1937 installment of the Mr. Moto series, Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation, starring Peter Lorre. Bleifer also appeared on stage during the 1930s, including the 1932 Broadway production of Clear All Wires, {{in the role of}} Sozanoff, which he would reprise the following year in the similarly titled film, Clear All Wires!, starring Lee Tracy, Benita Hume, Una Merkel, and James Gleason.|$|E

25|$|Garnett {{was drafted}} with the fifth overall {{pick in the}} 1995 NBA draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves, {{and became the first}} player to be drafted {{directly}} out of high school since 1975. Since joining the NBA for the 1989–90 season, the Timberwolves had not won more than 29 games in any season. In Garnett's rookie season, the Timberwolves {{were in the midst of}} a transition phase; they replaced Bill Blair with Flip Saunders as head coach early in the season, and made several trades. Garnett initially came off the bench in his rookie year, but moved into the starting lineup soon after Saunders became head coach. In his rookie year, Garnett and fellow newcomer Tom Gugliotta carried the scoring load. Garnett did not immediately leap to stardom as later prep-to-pro prospects such as Amar'e Stoudemire, LeBron James and Dwight Howard would, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very respectable rookie year. He averaged 10.4 points, 6.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists per game and was voted to the All-Rookie Second Team. Despite having some promising players, the Timberwolves suffered through their seventh consecutive sub-30 win season and failed to make the playoffs. At the time, Garnett was the youngest NBA player in history at 19 years and 11 months of age.|$|E
25|$|When the two {{submarines}} arrived {{they were}} off Mendoza Island (now Shenggao Island) {{at the entrance of}} the bay. The two then split up, L4 went to patrol around the entrance of the bay and Halahan ordered L5 to patrol within. Bias Bay is surrounded by rocks and that night there was a fleet of fishing junks sheltering inside and constantly moving around the anchorage. Both the rocks and the junks made it difficult for the British to monitor the area without being detected though they succeeded in doing so and on the morning of 20 October they encountered the Irene steaming off Cake Island. She had been taken over by at least eighteen pirates armed with automatic pistols. It was still dark so the L4 was surface cruising with a crew at the 4-inch (102-mm) gun and another pair at the vessel's searchlight. Lieutenant Halahan knew that torpedoes were not helpful in recapturing a pirate held ship but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> 4-inch (102-mm) deck gun. Then the Irene was spotted so Halahan maneuvered his submarine into position for firing and when the order was given, the search light was turned on and the gun crew fired a blank warning shot at the steamer. When the shot was ignored a second live round was fired and it blew a hole straight through the ship and killed a pirate who was standing on deck.|$|E

500|$|Though earlier historians saw Pembroke as {{the head}} of a 'middle party', between the {{extremes}} of Lancaster and the king, the modern consensus is that he remained essentially loyal to Edward throughout most of his career. Pembroke was married twice, and left no legitimate issue, though <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> bastard son. He is today remembered primarily through his wife's, Marie de St Pol, foundation of Pembroke College, Cambridge, and for his splendid tomb that can still be seen in Westminster Abbey.

500|$|Warning (stylized as WARNING:) is {{the sixth}} studio album by American punk rock band Green Day, {{released}} on October 3, 2000 by Reprise Records. Building upon its predecessor, Nimrod (1997), the album eschewed the band's trademark punk rock sound and incorporated acoustic elements and pop and folk styles. [...] Lyrically, the record contains more optimistic and inspirational themes {{in comparison with}} the band's earlier releases. Warning was also Green Day's first album since Kerplunk (1991) that was not produced by Rob Cavallo, although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hand in its production and was credited as executive producer.|$|E

[...] About the character, Fazekas added, [...] "What I love about Manfredi is he’s funny, he can flip on a dime and be a total psycho, and he is madly in love with Whitney and genuinely so—even when she’s cuckoo. Their scenes together, there’s such a tenderness to them". Since the character differs from its comic counterpart, Marino said [...] "the two things [...] " [...] were defining that Manfredi [...] "definitely was the muscle for Whitney, and that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> true love for her." [...] Marino wanted to make sure Manfredi [...] "felt like he was an old-school tough guy" [...] and felt that Frost was [...] "the one true love for him", comparing their relationship to Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe's.|$|E
500|$|Nosanchuk quickly {{resolved}} {{that the}} only way to win the case and prevent the teenager from being hanged was to explore the background and circumstances both of the incident and of Lamb himself with a view to a mental disorder defence. At their first interview together, Nosanchuk says that Lamb was a [...] "slightly built, almost frail, quiet and detached 18-year-old ... very boyish in appearance. He had an exceedingly polite demeanour. He was most appreciative and grateful that I had undertaken his defence." [...] When Nosanchuk asked the boy about the events of 25 June, Lamb became hesitant, disjointed and confused in his conversation; [...] "he seemed to view these events as if he was not really involved in them," [...] Nosanchuk recalled. Lamb said that although <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> faint recollection of what had happened, he could not remember taking the shotgun, loading it or shooting anybody. He said that earlier during the afternoon on 25 June he had watched a film on television in which somebody had shot and killed several people, but did not make clear whether he had been re-enacting this. The lawyer then asked Lamb to discuss his personal background, childhood and family. The 18-year-old was very reluctant to do so and when he did, Nosanchuk says that the boy seemed emotionally detached from the relatives and events he described.|$|E
500|$|The cliffhanger, {{in which}} Rousseau and Karl are killed and Alex calls out in desperation {{that she is}} Ben's daughter, gained a mixed response.

[...] Grading the episode as a [...] "B", Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen was also unimpressed with the cliffhanger and the characters carrying it; he felt that network executives were partially to blame for going against the wish of the show's creative team to broadcast [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] as a midseason premiere as opposed to a midseason finale.
