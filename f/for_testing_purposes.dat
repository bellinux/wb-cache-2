5|$|Little {{is known}} about West Alseks {{subsequent}} civilian career until early 1929. In February of that year, West Alsek, still under USSB ownership, was selected for the addition of pulverized coal-fired boilers <b>for</b> <b>testing</b> <b>purposes.</b> Coal pulverizers would take coal—often cheaper, inferior grades normally unsuitable for marine use—and grind them into coal dust. This dust would then be mixed with air and automatically injected into the boilers {{without the need for}} hand-feeding. West Alsek entered the Todd Brooklyn shipyard to undergo the conversion in late February.|$|E
5|$|The Cadillac Converj is a plug-in hybrid {{concept car}} first {{unveiled}} at the 2009 North American International Auto Show which incorporated the propulsion {{system from the}} Chevrolet Volt, including the Voltec powertrain. In August 2011, General Motors announced its decision to produce the Converj as the Cadillac ELR. The first 2014 ELRs rolled off the production line in late May 2013. These were pre-production units destined <b>for</b> <b>testing</b> <b>purposes</b> and production for retail customers started {{at the end of}} 2013. The ELR was released to retail customers in the U.S. in December 2013.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>testing</b> <b>purposes,</b> a {{new engine}} {{consisting}} of six Armstrong Siddeley Viper jet engines blowing across the outer rim of an impeller was designed {{under the name}} PV-704, PV stood for Private Venture. The PV-704 was a stop-gap design built into a bunker-like building behind the Avro Experimental Test facility. It was intended to test various Project 1794 concepts and provide the USAF with test data to show {{the viability of the}} concept. The original plan to initially test the Viper Engine Rig was to have continued into free flight testing. Unfortunately, testing was anything but smooth; the test model suffered from hazardous oil leaks, resulting in three fires. It eventually got to the point that staff were afraid of the machine, even when safely ensconced in a booth constructed of bullet-proof glass and quarter-inch-thick steel. A final, disastrous and nearly lethal engine test in 1956 which involved a Viper jet engine running wild, convinced Frost that a less dangerous test vehicle was necessary.|$|E

25|$|The envisioned {{test program}} {{was to have}} been quite thorough, which would have {{involved}} subjected full-scale aircraft to the severe temperatures anticipated at Mach 2.5 flight via a purpose-built heat chamber; upon reaching the flight testing phase, the prototypes had been scheduled to perform a total of 1,400 flight hours. The first prototype, which had received the internal designation Avro 731, a three-eighths scale aircraft <b>for</b> <b>testing</b> <b>purposes,</b> was scheduled to fly in 1959. A pair of Avro 731 prototypes were set to be built and flown in advance of the full-scale prototypes.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. FDA {{refused to}} approve {{thalidomide}} for marketing and distribution. However, {{the drug was}} distributed in large quantities <b>for</b> <b>testing</b> <b>purposes,</b> after the American distributor and manufacturer Richardson-Merrell had applied for its approval in September 1960. The official {{in charge of the}} FDA review, Frances Oldham Kelsey, did not rely on information from the company, which did not include any test results. Richardson-Merrell was called on to perform tests and report the results. The company demanded approval six times, and was refused each time. Nevertheless, a total of 17 children with thalidomide-induced malformations were born in the U.S.|$|E

25|$|Version 23, {{released}} in August 2013, followed {{the lead of}} its competitors by blocking iframe, stylesheet, and script resources served from non-HTTPS servers embedded on HTTPS pages by default. Additionally, JavaScript could also no longer be disabled through Firefox's preferences, and JavaScript was automatically re-enabled for users who upgraded to 23 or higher with it disabled. The change was made due to its use across the majority of websites, the potential repercussions on non-experienced users who are unaware of its impact, along with the availability of extensions such as NoScript, which can disable JavaScript in a more controlled fashion. The following release added the ability to disable JavaScript through the developer tools <b>for</b> <b>testing</b> <b>purposes.</b>|$|E

The tank chassis was delivered to the Swedish Army in May 1937, and the tank in July–August the same year. In July 1937, just some two months after it was delivered, the tank chassis was bought back by AB Landsverk {{in connection with a}} large order for Stridsvagn L-60 light tanks being made by the Swedish government from AB Landsverk.
