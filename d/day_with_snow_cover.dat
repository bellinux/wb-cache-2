40|$|This study uses 55  years of hourly {{observations}} of air temperature, relative humidity, daily precipitation, <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> and cloud cover from 15  climate stations across the Canadian Prairies to analyze biosphere-atmosphere interactions. We will provide {{examples of the}} coupling between climate, <b>snow</b> <b>cover,</b> clouds, and land use. <b>Snow</b> <b>cover</b> acts as a fast climate switch. <b>With</b> the first <b>snow</b> fall, air temperature falls by 10  °C, and a similar increase in temperature occurs <b>with</b> <b>snow</b> melt. Climatologically, <b>days</b> <b>with</b> <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> are 10  °C cooler than <b>days</b> <b>with</b> no <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> in Alberta. However the interannual variability has a larger range, so that for every 10  % decrease in <b>days</b> <b>with</b> <b>snow</b> <b>cover,</b> the mean October to April climate is warmer by 1. 4  to 1. 5  °C. <b>Snow</b> <b>cover</b> also transforms the coupling between clouds and the diurnal cycle of air temperature from a boundary layer regime dominated by shortwave cloud forcing in the warm season to one dominated by longwave cloud forcing <b>with</b> <b>snow</b> <b>cover.</b> Changing agricultural land use in the past thirty years, specifically the reduction of summer fallowing, has cooled and moistened the growing season climate and increased summer precipitation.

40|$|Abstract. The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to analyze the {{influence}} of atmospheric circulation, expressed by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index on <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> duration in Romania. The correlation coefficients between the NAO index values and the monthly number of <b>days</b> <b>with</b> <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> at 99 stations from December to March 1961 - 1990 are mostly negative. The strongest correlation was obtained in southwestern Romania in January. The monthly mean number of <b>days</b> <b>with</b> <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> decreases from the northwestern to the southeastern Romania, reaching the greatest values in the mountainous area. The <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> is more persistent in January and March during the NAO positive phase and in December during the negative one. The dependency of <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> duration on altitude appeared both for the positive and negative NAO phase.

In all the winter months, the largest values of the annual mean number have been recorded in the mountainous region of Romania, where the variability index is the smallest. For each month from December until March the “active ” <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> areas have been determined by using the climatological frequencies of <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> occurrence. The relationship between the <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> duration and the temperature was analysed in the winter months (December-March).

The strongest correlations were found in January, February and March in the southern, eastern and central parts of Romania.

The westerly and northerly atmospheric circulation types have been taken into consideration and their association <b>with</b> <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> duration in Romania was examined.

50|$|Another {{thing that}} {{also can be}} seen on KNMI charts is the fact that <b>snow</b> <b>cover</b> is bigger and last a lot longer in Middelburg than the coast especially, but also to all other parts of the province.

In those situations, amateur stations directly on the coast note temperatures well above freezing and even rain while in Middelburg the mercury remains just or well below zero with snowfall. Just a couple of kilometers more inland the snowshowers break up and no snowfall is recorded. In this way, Middelburg seems to be in just the right (or wrong) position.
