50|$|Since 1852 several {{conferences}} {{were held}} involving European powers, {{with a view}} to uniform action in keeping out infection from the East and preventing its spread within Europe. All but that of 1897 were concerned with cholera. No result came of those at Paris (1852), Constantinople (1866), Vienna (1874), and Rome (1885), but each of the subsequent ones doctrine of constructive infection of a ship as coming from a scheduled port, and an approximation to the principles advocated by Great Britain for many years. The principal countries which retained the old system at the time were Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Greece and Russia (the British possessions at the time, Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus, being under the same influence). The aim of each <b>international</b> <b>sanitary</b> <b>convention</b> had been to bind the governments to a uniform minimum of preventive action, with further restrictions permissible to individual countries. The minimum specified by international conventions was very nearly the same as the British practice, which had been in turn adapted to continental opinion in the matter of the importation of rags.|$|E
50|$|With {{advances}} in medical science, {{the discovery of}} penicillin and vaccination programs, major infectious diseases were now a much reduced threat to public health, and the emergency use of Lawlor's Island as a quarantine station was falling rapidly. During the 1920s and 1930s, the cost of salaries, supplies, and services outweighed the benefits of quarantining minor infectious diseases on Lawlor's Island. Costs included telephone charges, uniforms and large quantities of drugs and medical supplies. Following the Paris <b>International</b> <b>Sanitary</b> <b>Convention</b> of 1926, the Canadian deputy minister of health decided in 1936 that it would cease to house quarantine patients on the island. However when smallpox was detected by Pier 21 medical staff in a steamship sailor in 1938, Lawlor Island to be used a final time to contain an outbreak. The sailors and infected medical staff were quarantined and treated on the island. In place of Lawlor's Island, the government used a quarantine space at the Pier 21 immigration terminal and created an isolation ward at the former Rockhead Prison in Halifax's North End in 1938.|$|E
40|$|Background Attention {{to global}} health {{security}} governance {{is more important}} now than ever before. Scientists predict that a possible influenza pandemic could affect 1. 5 billion people, cause up to 150 million deaths and leave US$ 3 trillion in economic damages. A public health emergency in one country is now only hours away from affecting many others. Methods Using regime analysis from political science, the principles, norms, rules and decision-making procedures by which states govern health security are examined in the historical context of their punctuated evolution. This methodology illuminates the catalytic agents of change, distributional consequences and possible future orders that can help to better inform progress in this area. Findings Four periods of global health security governance are identified. The first is characterized by unilateral quarantine regulations (1377 – 1851), the second by multiple sanitary conferences (1851 – 92), the third by several <b>international</b> <b>sanitary</b> <b>conventions</b> and <b>international</b> health organizations (1892 – 1946) and the fourth by the hegemonic leadership of the World Health Organizatio...|$|R
40|$|Trade is {{the lifeblood}} of all commerce. The {{exchange}} {{of goods and services}} has played a defining role in human history, creating vast empires, encouraging mass migration, and sometimes tipping the balance between peace and conflict. It is thus unsurprising that protecting and encouraging international trade has remained a top priority for governments, businesses and international organisations. Historically, the protection of health has been a permitted reason for restricting trade. Trade brought plague to Athens in 430 BC, killing as much as one third of the population, as well as to fourteenth century Europe after which quarantine practices were introduced. During the nineteenth century, flourishing trade also facilitated the spread of diseases such as cholera. This prompted a series of <b>International</b> <b>Sanitary</b> Conferences among leading trading nations, and the adoption of <b>International</b> <b>Sanitary</b> <b>Conventions</b> (forerunners of the present day International Health Regulations). While protecting health was a clear aim, in reality the primary task was to minimise interference by health matters on trade. Today, there are greater tensions than ever before between promoting trade and protecting health because of globalisation. Successive rounds of trade negotiations held since th...|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} {{international}} measures {{to prevent and}} control epidemics of cholera, the plague, yellow fever, malaria and typhus which ravaged the world throughout the 19 th century, led {{to a series of}} <b>International</b> <b>Sanitary</b> Conferences and <b>Conventions</b> under the leadership of European states. Between 1851 and 1938 fourteen conferences - Paris (1851), Paris (1859), Istanbul (1866), Vienna (1874), Washington D. C. (1881), Rome (1885), Venice (1892), Dresden (1893), Paris (1894), Venice (1897), Paris (1903), (1911), (1926) and (1938) - and eight conventions - 1892, 1893, 1894, 1897, 1903, 1912, 1926, 1938 were held.

40|$|The fear instilled by cholera, {{a severe}} diarrheal illness caused by {{certain types of}} Vibrio cholerae, {{provided}} the impetus for modern public health surveillance activities, initially via the <b>International</b> <b>Sanitary</b> <b>Convention</b> in 1903. 1 V. cholerae is a motile gram-negative organism which produces a lipopolysaccharide O-antigen. Epidemic cholera is only caused by toxin-producing strains (i. e. toxigenic) of Vibrio cholerae belonging to serogroups O 1 and O 139. Although many other strains can produce diarrheal illness, nontoxigenic and non-O 1 and non-O 139 strains do not cause epidemics. Cholera {{was one of only}} three diseases that all member nations agreed to report to the World Health Organization under the subsequent International Sanitary Regulations, adopted in 1951 and renamed the International Health Regulations (IHR) in 1969. 1 In 2005, the IHR was revised to include the notifi cation of diseases which constitute a “public health emergency of international concern”, but cholera remains one of the special named diseases for which reporting is mandatory. 2 In 2009, 221, 226 cases and 4, 946 deaths from 45 countries were reported to WHO. 3 As has been the recent trend, nearly 98 % of reported cholera cases were from countries in Africa [...] There were only 3, 859 cases reported in the Asia and Pacifi c region, accounting for less than 2 % of cases reported, however given limitations in surveillance and under reporting due to the fear of trade and travel restrictions, the true burden of cholera is not known. 3 Of the reported cases from Asia and the Pacifi c region, over half wer...|$|E
