5|$|Depending on {{the path}} taken by the player, Jill's final {{encounter}} with Nicholai will differ. In one version of the events, Nicholai will attempt to start a gunfight with Jill, only to be taken by surprise by Nemesis. In another event, Nicholai will hijack Jill's intended escape chopper, and the player must choose to either reason with Nicholai or destroy the helicopter. If Jill negotiates with Nicholai, he reveals that he has killed the other supervisors and boasts about collecting the bounty placed on Jill by Umbrella before escaping. Regardless of Nicholai's fate, Jill makes <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear yard and confronts Nemesis one last time. After an intense battle, Jill defeats Nemesis {{with the help of}} a prototype railgun before meeting up with Carlos and escaping the city via a helicopter. If the previous escape chopper was stolen by Nicholai, Jill and Carlos will instead meet up with S.T.A.R.S. Alpha Team's weapons specialist Barry Burton, who helps them escape in his own helicopter instead. The final cutscene of the game shows the thermobaric missile strike vaporizing the Raccoon City and its infected populace.|$|E
5|$|Entering the facility, Alice meets a {{holograph}} of the Red Queen's sister AI, the White Queen (Madeline Carroll).

On <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lab's lower levels, Alice discovers one of her clones, still in development. The clone awakens, but seems to die from shock upon seeing Alice. Alice finds {{a replica of the}} mansion she lived in and finds Isaacs, who fights her with equal strength and telekinesis. Finding themselves in a replica of The Hive's laser corridor, Alice awaits the grid's arrival, watching Isaacs getting sliced into cubes. Just as Alice is about to meet the same fate, the system is deactivated by her clone, which has inexplicably revived.|$|E
5|$|Lara {{returns to}} the {{survivors}} on the beach to find that Whitman has betrayed them, abducting Sam and handing her over to Mathias. Lara, Jonah, and Reyes give chase, heading up a river in the fixed boat to the monastery, with Lara arriving {{just in time to}} see Mathias trick Whitman into approaching and speaking to some of Stormguards, who kill him. After fighting her way through both the Solarii and the Stormguard, Lara arrives at the top of the monastery where Mathias is performing the Ascension ritual. Lara fights <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> central platform, and after a struggle, shoots Mathias off the platform to his death using both his pistol and her own in her signature dual-wielding style. Despite Mathias' death, the ritual is already underway, with Himiko's soul starting to pour into Sam. Lara then destroys Himiko's ancient remains, saving Sam and dispersing the storms.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, a young {{traveller}} named Bartz, {{resting in}} the woods near Tycoon, witnesses a meteorite plunge to the planet's surface just outside the castle. Bartz promptly investigates, discovering Lenna lying unconscious from attack. After rescuing her, they discover {{an old man in}} the debris with partial amnesia named Galuf. Lenna explains that she had been on <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Wind Shrine after her father. Galuf suddenly recalls that it was his original destination as well, opting to accompany her. Though the trio part ways, Bartz soon encounters Lenna and Galuf again assaulted by monsters in a quaking valley. The three travel together, finding all land routes blockaded by the upheavals caused by the meteorite's fall. Exploring an underground cavern, they encounter a den of pirates and their leader, Faris. With the help of the pirate captain, the group makes its way to the Wind Shrine to discover the shattered Crystal, but no sign of the missing king. The shards react to their presence, however, and an image of Tycoon appears, explaining to them that they must protect those Crystals that yet remain.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 3 {{begins on}} September 27, 1998, 24 hours {{prior to the}} events of Resident Evil 2. Jill Valentine, a former Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) member, {{attempts}} to escape from Raccoon City. Nearly all of Raccoon City's citizens have been transformed into zombies by an outbreak of the T-virus, a new type of biological weapon secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. On <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Raccoon City Police Department, Jill runs into fellow team member Brad Vickers, who is killed by a new enemy. This creature, named Nemesis, is a bio-organic weapon programmed to target surviving S.T.A.R.S. members, witnesses of Umbrella's experiments. As she evades Nemesis, Jill encounters three surviving members of the Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (U.B.C.S.): Carlos Oliveira, Mikhail Victor and Nicholai Ginovaef. Nicholai explains to Jill and Carlos that a rescue helicopter can be contacted if they manage to reach the city's Clock Tower and ring the bell.|$|E
5|$|The Aberdeen trawler Ben Doran A178, foundered on the Ve Skerries 3miles {{northwest}} of Papa Stour, {{on the evening}} of 28 March 1930 while on <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village of Scalloway to land her catch. When she grounded weather conditions were fairly good {{but it was not until}} the following day that a passing trawler saw, and reported the wreck. By the time that various rescue attempts were launched by the coastguard and local volunteers (there being no lifeboat in Shetland at that time), weather conditions had deteriorated to the point where it was impossible to approach the skerries. A request had been made for the Stromness lifeboat from Orkney, only 120miles away, to launch, but the request was made too late to be of help. All 9 crew perished in the wreck. Only 3 bodies were recovered, that of James Mitchell, which was returned to Aberdeen, and the bodies of J. Cormack and J.R. Insh, which were buried in Scalloway.|$|E

5|$|After escaping, Cornfoot made <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{village of}} Leuchars, eight miles from Pittenweem, {{where she was}} either {{discovered}} by the minister, George Gordon, or had approached him for help. For the reward of £10, he arranged an armed guard of two men to return her to Cowper's house on 30 January 1705. Cowper was not at home when they arrived so she was taken {{to one of the}} bailies. A mob of at least ten people forcibly removed her from the house, tied her up, beat her, then hauled her down to the harbour by her ankles, possibly with the intention of dunking her. A rope was run {{from the top of the}} masthead on a ship back to the shore and she was dangled from it while the crowd threw stones at her as she swung backwards and forwards. When they took her down, she was covered by a door that had heavy stones placed on top of it until she was crushed to death. A cart pulled by a horse was guided over her corpse more than once to ensure she was dead. The crowd took her body to the home of her co-accused, Nicolas Lawson, with the intention of torturing her in the same manner but decided they had sufficient sport for the day.|$|E
5|$|Max {{breaks through}} {{security}} at the train yard and boards the train. She locates Van Der Mescht, who initially refuses to help her. After Max threatens him with torture, Van Der Mescht explains that I Corporation was a rival of Manticore, and had a military contract for more aggressive genetic research. They created a 'Y' series of genetically engineered soldiers (as opposed to Manticore's 'X' series); when Max and Beka were born, Beka was taken by I Corporation so that the two different series could be compared. I Corporation guards ambush the room, killing Van Der Mescht before he can divulge more. I Corporation send a single soldier, a transgenic boss named Bear, to kill Max. Bear is defeated, and Max reaches the I Corporation headquarters with the train. Max fights <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upper level of the headquarters, defeating guards and the boss characters Beetle, Gekko and Bear again, before she confronts Beka. Beka reveals that she now controls the I Corporation, and has engineered a younger replacement to succeed her using the DNA that she and Max shares. She tries to recruit Max to join her and their 'younger sister' in creating {{a new generation of}} genetically engineered soldiers. Max refuses and Beka attacks her. After killing Beka, Max tries to rescue her younger sister. The cloaked figure, whose identity is never revealed, tries unsuccessfully to stop her. Logan arrives in a helicopter and rescues Max and her younger sister from the complex. Later, while sitting {{on the roof of the}} Space Needle, Max laments that knowing the truth about Beka is worse than not knowing at all, but is determined to create a positive life for herself and her younger sister. A post-credits scene shows Max and Original Cindy dancing in their apartment.|$|E
5|$|They {{remained}} {{part of the}} 2nd BS through February 1919, but {{had been}} transferred to the 3rd BS of the Home Fleet by May, Orion becoming the squadron flagship. By the end of 1919, the 3rd BS had been disbanded and the sisters had been transferred to the Reserve Fleet at Portland, although Monarch was transferred to Portsmouth in early 1920. Monarch and Thunderer were temporarily recommissioned {{during the summer of}} 1920 to ferry troops to the Mediterranean and back. Orion joined Monarch at Portsmouth later in the year and became the flagship of the Reserve Fleet. Conqueror followed Orion to Portsmouth and relieved her as flagship in mid-1921 and the latter ship was again temporarily recommissioned to transport troops. Thunderer was converted into a training ship for naval cadets in 1921 and Orion became a gunnery training ship after being relieved. In accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, Orion and Conqueror were sold for scrap in 1922 and broken up the following year; Monarch was initially listed for sale, but was hulked instead. In 1923, she was converted into a target ship and was used to test the effects of bombs and shells, until she was sunk in early 1925. Thunderer was the last surviving ship and was sold in late 1926. On <b>her</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scrapyard, she ran aground {{at the entrance to the}} Port of Blyth, Northumberland, but was refloated and scrapped the following year.|$|E
