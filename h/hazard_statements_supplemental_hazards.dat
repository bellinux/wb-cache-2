30|$|According to the CLP Regulation, {{experiences}} made in {{epidemiological data}} and experiences from occupational data or accident databases {{should be taken}} into account. In the case of cosmetic products the information gathered by poison centers would be very precious for the classification process. This is one example where a better coordination between the Cosmetics Regulation and the CLP Regulation would be very helpful [10]. When evidence in humans indicates problems with certain products, but the criteria for the regular H-statements are not met, <b>supplemental</b> <b>hazard</b> information should then be written on the container of such products. For cosmetic products this might be, e.g. EUH 066 — ‘Repeated exposure may cause skin dryness or cracking.’, EUH 070 — ‘Toxic by eye contact.’, EUH 071 — ‘Corrosive to the respiratory tract.’ ([1] Annex II Part 1). However, due to the general exception of the CLP Regulation this <b>supplemental</b> <b>hazard</b> information is not implemented for cosmetic products.|$|R

50|$|Current {{training}} {{procedures for}} Hazard Communication in the United States are more detailed than the GHS training recommendations.

Employees and emergency responders will need to be trained on all new program elements, from <b>hazard</b> <b>statements</b> to pictograms. Bear in mind, if products are imported from countries that implement GHS prior to the United States and Canada, employee training may need to begin earlier than expected.|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{stepwise}} method for {{assessment of the}} HP 12 is proposed and tested with 49 waste samples. The hazard property HP 12 is defined as “Release of an acute toxic gas”: waste which releases acute toxic gases (Acute Tox. 1, 2 or 3) in contact with water or an acid. When a waste contains a substance {{assigned to one of}} the following <b>supplemental</b> <b>hazards</b> EUH 029, EUH 031 and EUH 032, it shall be classified as hazardous by HP 12 according to test methods or guidelines (EC, 2014 a, 2014 b). When the substances with the cited <b>hazard</b> <b>statement</b> codes react with water or an acid, they can release HCl, Cl 2, HF, HCN, PH 3, H 2 S, SO 2 (and two other gases very unlikely to be emitted, hydrazoic acid HN 3 and selenium oxide SeO 2 – a solid with low vapor pressure). Hence, a method is proposed : - 1. Measurement of the volume of gases emitted into contact with water or an acid (solid/liquid ratio of 10 L water or acid/kg raw waste, acid 2. 5 M HNO 3). - 2. If gas is emitted at a rate higher than 0. 1 L of gas/kg waste in 5 min (limit of quantification of the automated calcimètre used here), checking if one of the cited gases is emitted with electrochemical detection probes or simple qualitative colorimetric methods. - 3. If one of these gases is detected, speciation of the emitting substance(s) (calculation by the “worst case” method from elements concentrations, or by specific analytic methods) and checking whether they have a <b>hazard</b> <b>statement</b> code EUH 029, EUH 031 or EUH 032 (a list is provided). For a set of 49 waste, water addition did not produce gas. Nearly all the solid waste produced a gas in contact with hydrochloric acid in 5 min in an automated calcimeter with a volume > 0. 1 L of gas per kg of waste. Since a plateau of pressure is reached only for half of the samples in 5 min, 6 h trial with calorimetric bombs or glass flasks were done and confirmed the results. Identification of the gases by portable probes showed that most of the tested samples emit mainly CO 2. Toxic gases are emitted by four waste: metallic dust from the aluminum industry (CO), two air pollution control residue of industrial waste incinerator (H 2 S) and a halogenated solvent (organic volatile(s) compound(s)). HF has not been measured in these trials started before the present definition of HP 12. According to the definition of HP 12, only the H 2 S emission of substances with <b>hazard</b> <b>statement</b> EUH 031 is accounted for. In view of the calcium content of the two air pollution control residue, the presence of calcium sulphide (EUH 031) can be assumed. These two waste are therefore classified potentially hazardous for HP 12, from a total of 49 waste. They are also classified as hazardous for other properties (HP 7, 10 and 14 for one of them, and HP 10 and 14 for the other one respectively). Given these results, it can be assumed that few common household and industrial waste will be classified hazardous only by HP 12...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe safety {{data sheet}} (SDS), {{formerly}} known in the United States as the material {{safety data sheet}} (MSDS), contains important information for the safe handling of chemicals. This manuscript will cover the use of safety data sheets for process design and safe handling of chemicals. Three main categories (flammability, physical properties, and toxicity) listed in a SDS will be explained. Within each category, examples will be presented on how the specific information can be used in the design of safe chemical operations. Further, within the United States, the Department of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) revised their hazard communication standard in March of 2012. Specifically, the standard has been aligned with the United Nations’ Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). Changes include requirements for use of standardized signal words, pictograms, <b>hazard</b> <b>statements,</b> and precautionary statements. The presentation will review examples of these important changes, and relating these to the GHS for safe use of chemicals within the workplace worldwide...|$|R

30|$|Construction {{products}} are usually complex mixtures containing many more chemicals than {{included on the}} list of priority substances: residues from the production process and additives such as plasticizers, stabilization agents, pigments, surfactants, and solvents. In addition, the transformation of substances during the service life can result in as yet unknown substances and will be an important task for non-targeted analysis and fundamental research. Identifying relevant substances leaching from the materials is, therefore, quite a challenge. Usually, the process is a stepwise approach and depends on the information available. The formulation of the product, if it is available, is a good starting point for substance identification. This compound list can be checked for substances that are classified as environmental hazards in accordance with the globally harmonized system of classifying and labeling chemicals [49] or those included in the indicative list [50]. Especially substances with a high acute toxicity (<b>hazard</b> <b>statement</b> H 400) and with long-lasting effects (H 410, H 411) are of concern. Knowledge of the presence of potential dangerous substances alone is not sufficient information, as total content is a poor indicator of the leaching potential and the resulting concentrations in the eluates. Furthermore, dangerous substances in the bulk material {{do not have to be}} reported if the concentrations are below reporting thresholds.|$|R
