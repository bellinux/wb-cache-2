5|$|In 1943, the {{formation}} of the Commando unit was changed. Each Commando now consisted of a small headquarters group, five fighting troops, a <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons</b> troop, and a signals platoon. The fighting troops consisted of 65 men of all ranks divided into two 30–man sections which were subdivided into three 10–man subsections. The <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons</b> troop was made up of 3-inch mortar and Vickers machine gun teams. The Commandos were provided with the motor transport needed to accompany them on operations. Their transport now consisted of the commanding officer's car, 15 motorcycles (six with side cars), ten 15 cwt trucks, and three 3-ton trucks. The <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons</b> troop had seven Jeeps and trailers and one Jeep for each of the fighting troops and the headquarters. This gave them enough vehicles of their own to accommodate two fighting troops, the <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons</b> troop, and the Commando Headquarters.|$|E
5|$|In April, the Bosnian Serbs {{were able}} to deploy 200,000 troops, {{hundreds}} of tanks, armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and artillery pieces. The Bosnian Croats could field approximately 25,000 soldiers {{and a handful of}} <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons,</b> while the Bosniaks were largely unprepared for combat with nearly 100,000 troops, but small arms for less than half of their number and virtually no <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|E

5|$|U.S. Air Force A-10 {{aircraft}} fired approximately 10,000 30mm {{rounds in}} Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1994–95. Following {{the seizure of}} some <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons</b> by Bosnian Serbs from a warehouse in Ilidža, a series of sorties were launched to locate and destroy the captured equipment. On 5 August 1994, two A-10s located and strafed an anti-tank vehicle. Afterward, the Serbs agreed to return remaining <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons.</b> In August 1995, NATO launched an offensive called Operation Deliberate Force. A-10s flew close air support missions, attacking Bosnian Serb artillery and positions. In late September, A-10s began flying patrols again.|$|E
5|$|After Dieppe the {{headquarters}} staff changed again. Lovat {{was promoted to}} brigadier and given command of the 1st Special Service Brigade. Mills-Roberts was promoted and sent to North Africa to take over command of No. 6 Commando. They were replaced by Robert Dawson as the CO and Ronald Menday as 2IC. Other changes included moving to a new base in Falmouth {{and the formation of}} a <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons</b> troop in each commando. The new troop with mortar and Vickers machine gun sections provided the <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons</b> needed for their new role as assault infantry. By now the Commandos had started to move away from smaller raiding operations. They were formed into units intended to spearhead future Allied landing operations. To assist in this they were given the organic fire support weapons, that had been absent when they were a raiding force.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Marine Provisional Brigade, in {{conjunction}} with Task Force Hill, mounted a massive offensive on Cloverleaf Hill and Obong-ni on August 17. The offensive began at 0800 on August 17, with US forces unleashing all <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons</b> available to them against the North Korean positions; artillery, mortars, M26 Pershing tanks, and airstrikes.|$|E

5|$|By 22:15 {{the brigade}} had secured {{all of its}} day one {{objectives}} {{and some of the}} missing men had arrived in the brigade area. However, there were many still unaccounted for. The 4th Parachute Battalion numbered around 200 men with almost no <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons.</b> The 6th (Royal Welch) Parachute Battalion had 317 men. There were only enough men of the 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion to guard the approach roads leading to the drop zone from the north.|$|E
5|$|From 1944 the Operational Holding Commando Headquarters was formed. It was {{responsible}} for two sub–units: the Army and Royal Marines Holding Commando Wings. Both units had an establishment of five troops and a <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons</b> troop of fully trained commandos. The men in these troops were to provide individual or complete troop replacements for the Commando units in the field. In December 1944, the four Special Service brigades were re-designated as Commando brigades.|$|E
5|$|On Fox Green, at {{the eastern}} end of Omaha, four {{sections}} of L/16 had survived their landing intact and were now leading elements of I/16, K/16 and E/116 up the slopes. With supporting fire from the <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons</b> of M/16, tanks and destroyers, this force eliminated WN-60, which defended the draw at F-1; by 09:00, the 3rd battalion 16th RCT was moving inland.|$|E

5|$|The HVO, {{supported}} by Croatian Army artillery deployed {{north of the}} river, managed to withstand the offensive and the front line remained unchanged from the commencement of the battle. This demonstrated the changed balance of power {{at this stage of}} the war. At the commencement of the war, the VRS had greater military capabilities than its opponents, particularly in terms of <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons</b> and organisation, but over three years from mid-1992 its capabilities had been matched by its adversaries.|$|E
5|$|The JNA and the VRS in Bosnia and Herzegovina {{faced the}} Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Armija Republike Bosne i Hercegovine – ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO), {{reporting}} to the Bosniak-dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively, {{as well as the}} Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV), which occasionally supported HVO operations. In late April, the VRS was able to deploy 200,000 troops, hundreds of tanks, armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and artillery pieces. The HVO and the Croatian Defence Forces (Hrvatske obrambene snage – HOS) could field approximately 25,000 soldiers and a handful of <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons,</b> while the ARBiH was largely unprepared with nearly 100,000 troops, small arms for less than a half of their number and virtually no <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons.</b> Arming of the various forces was hampered by a UN arms embargo introduced in September 1991. By mid-May 1992, when those JNA units which had not been transferred to the VRS withdrew from Bosnia and Herzegovina to the newly declared Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the VRS controlled approximately 60 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|The entire 24th Division {{gathered}} {{to make a}} final stand around Taejon, holding a line along the Kum River {{to the east of}} the city. Hampered by a lack of communication and equipment, and a shortage of <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons</b> to match the KPA's firepower, the outnumbered, ill-equipped and untrained American forces were pushed back from the riverbank after several days before fighting an intense urban battle to defend the city. After a fierce three-day struggle, the Americans withdrew.|$|E

5|$|When the 13th Parachute Battalion {{advanced}} {{close enough}} to Hill 13, they carried out a bayonet charge on the summit. However, {{they arrived at the}} same time as a battalion of German reinforcements, who immediately counter-attacked, forcing the battalion back, inflicting several casualties. A follow-up attack by the Germans on the withdrawing British was stopped by an artillery barrage. During this time the 12th Parachute Battalion captured Putot-en-Auge, taking 160 prisoners and several <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although JNA {{losses were}} {{undoubtedly}} substantial, the exact numbers are unclear {{because of a}} lack of official data. The JNA officially acknowledged 1,279 killed in action, including 177 officers, during the entire war in Croatia. According to Tus, the JNA's Novi Sad corps alone lost 1,300 soldiers during the campaign in eastern Slavonia. He extrapolates from this to estimate that between 6,000 and 8,000 soldiers and volunteers died in eastern Slavonia, with the loss of 600 armoured vehicles and <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons</b> and over 20 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|CANBAT 1 was {{expected}} to deploy one mechanised company each to the JORDBAT and the NEPBAT AORs to position themselves defensively. The forces would attempt to deter the HV from advancing, demonstrate its resolve to defend Sector West, engage the HV with antitank weapons and mortars, protect the Jordanian and Nepalese withdrawal and withdraw {{under the protection of}} CANBAT 1. The two companies required eight hours notice of the HV advance to reach their designated positions in time. Presumably, the ARSK would retrieve its <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons</b> from the UNPROFOR storage by force and resist the HV.|$|E

5|$|Croatian {{forces were}} {{hampered}} by an inadequate command structure, poor coordination and lack <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons.</b> The battle {{resulted in more}} than 200 combat deaths, and established lines of control which would remain unchanged until 1994, when the plateau was recaptured by the HVO. In 2012, Republika Srpska authorities charged seven Croats with war crimes committed at the plateau against civilians and prisoners of war. The next year, Croatian authorities charged 21 former JNA members with war crimes against HVO prisoners captured at the Kupres Plateau.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944, Nedić {{sent the}} 2nd Battalion of the 5th Regiment of the SDK to Montenegro to {{supplement}} Đurišić's forces. In {{the first half}} of 1944, the Germans in Montenegro and the Sandžak organised offensives against the Partisans, largely relying on forces under the command of Lašić and Đurišić. Because of the weakness of their own forces, the Germans contributed by commanding and supplying the troops involved, and providing smaller mobile armoured units with <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons.</b> The Chetnik leaders provided most of the troops. In February and March, the Germans and numerous Chetnik units undertook a series of operations codenamed Bora, Baumblüte and Vorfrühling around Podgorica.|$|E
5|$|In February 1994 (when {{air strikes}} were {{originally}} threatened), NATO {{had created a}} <b>heavy</b> <b>weapons</b> exclusion zone around Sarajevo, and collected weapons {{at a number of}} sites. On 5 August, the VRS seized several weapons from the Illidža Weapons Collection site in clear violation of the exclusion zone agreement. During the seizure, Serb forces injured a Ukrainian UNPROFOR peacekeeper. In response to the attack, the UN once again requested NATO air support. Two U.S. A-10 aircraft repeatedly strafed Serb targets, and the Serbs returned the seized weapons to the collection site.|$|E
