5|$|The {{deaths of}} twelve newborn babies in Banja Luka {{hospital}} {{due to a}} shortage of incubator bottled oxygen were cited as an <b>immediate</b> <b>cause</b> for the action, but the veracity of the incident has since been questioned.

5|$|The <b>immediate</b> <b>cause</b> for a {{confrontation}} with the JNA in Split was a blockade of the village of Kijevo, where Croatian authorities had established a new police station, imposed on 29 April. The village was surrounded by the JNA, commanded by Colonel Ratko Mladić, and the Serb insurgent forces, cutting access and preventing delivery of supplies. Tuđman called on the public to bring the siege to its end.|$|E

The staff were praised by the AEC for their actions to avoid endangering the public, by sealing the materials and evacuating the building for six hours.|$|E

40|$|Theories {{typically}} emphasize affordances or intentions as {{the primary}} determinant of an object’s perceived function. The HIPE theory assumes that people integrate both into causal models that produce functional attributions. In these models, an object’s physical structure and an agent’s action specify an affordance jointly, constituting the <b>immediate</b> <b>causes</b> of a perceived function. The object’s design history and an agent’s goal in using it constitute distant causes. When specified fully, the <b>immediate</b> <b>causes</b> are sufficient for determining the perceived function—distant causes have no effect (the causal proximity principle). When the <b>immediate</b> <b>causes</b> are ambiguous or unknown, distant causes produce inferences about the <b>immediate</b> <b>causes,</b> thereby affecting functional attributions indirectly (the causal updating principle). Seven experiments supported HIPE’s predictions. Function is a central construct in cognitive science and cognitive neuroscience. Cognitive psychologists {{have shown that the}} categorization of an artifact depends not only on its physical properties, but also on its function (e. g., Barton & Komatsu, 1989; Keil...|$|R
5|$|Verdi had {{intended}} to return to Italy in early 1848, but was prevented by work and illness, as well as, most probably, by his increasing attachment to Strepponi.

5|$|On 26 February, {{an interim}} report {{published}} by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch outlined the current progress of the investigation. The report contained a single conclusion, that the <b>immediate</b> <b>cause</b> of the accident was {{the condition of the}} stretcher bar arrangement at points 2B at Lambrigg crossover, which resulted in the loss of gauge separation of the point switch blades. The stretcher bars (components that hold the moving blades of the points the correct distance apart) had been found to be disconnected or missing. Of the three bars, one was not in position, another had nuts and bolts missing, and two were fractured. The points in question were facing the direction of travel of the train.|$|E

5|$|The Anglo-Zanzibar War was a {{military}} conflict fought between the United Kingdom and the Zanzibar Sultanate on 27 August 1896. The conflict lasted between 38 and 45 minutes, marking it as the shortest recorded war in history. The <b>immediate</b> <b>cause</b> {{of the war was}} the death of the pro-British Sultan Hamad bin Thuwaini on 25 August 1896 and the subsequent succession of Sultan Khalid bin Barghash. The British authorities preferred Hamud bin Muhammed, who was more favourable to British interests, as sultan. In accordance with a treaty signed in 1886, a condition for accession to the sultanate was that the candidate obtain the permission of the British consul, and Khalid had not fulfilled this requirement. The British considered this a casus belli and sent an ultimatum to Khalid demanding that he order his forces to stand down and leave the palace. In response, Khalid called up his palace guard and barricaded himself inside the palace.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedPast attempts to explain Greek-Turkish conflict {{have been built}} on two underlying themes. One theme focuses on incompatible Greek and Turkish interests while the other identifies cultural and social {{differences between the two}} countries as the primary <b>causes</b> for competition. <b>Immediate</b> <b>causes</b> for the conflict include issues ranging from domestic political considerations to the international setting. This thesis examines the 1955, 1963, 1967, 1974, 1976 and 1987 Greek-Turkish crises as it questions the primacy of underlying or <b>immediate</b> <b>causes</b> in Greek-Turkish conflict. After examining possible reasons for the failure of past mediations in resolving the underlying causes of the conflict, this thesis suggests that national interests as well as cultural realities {{from both sides of the}} Aegean have to be considered in any mediation attempt. <b>Immediate</b> <b>causes</b> do not seem critical for the evolution of the conflict even though they determine the development and outcome of particular crises. This thesis also recognizes, that successful resolution of Greek-Turkish differences will be of benefit not only to the two countries but to regional stability as well (Cyprus, Balkans, Southeastern Mediterranean). Organizations with which the two countries are associated, (NATO, EU, WEU) have only to gain from a Greek- Turkish rapprochement[URL] Hellenic Nav...|$|R
