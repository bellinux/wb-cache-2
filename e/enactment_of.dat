5|$|By the 1910s, {{the use of}} breaker boys was {{dropping}} because of improvements in technology, stricter child labor laws, and the <b>enactment</b> <b>of</b> compulsory education laws. The practice of employing children in coal breakers largely ended by 1920 because of {{the efforts of the}} National Child Labor Committee, sociologist and photographer Lewis Hine, and the National Consumers League, all of whom educated the public about the practice and succeeded in obtaining passage of national child labor laws.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, {{there is}} overlap between weapon dance and stylized forms of stage combat, i.e., choreographed <b>enactments</b> <b>of</b> “real fights,” from bar-room brawls to sword-fighting to {{large-scale}} battle scenes. Stage combat uses {{the services of}} professionals called “fight directors,” [...] “weapon choreographers,” etc. An early example {{of this kind of}} staged combat in Europe was in Italy in the late 19th century, where the term tramagnini came to be used generically in the sense of “extra” or “stunt man” for those who fought on the stage in <b>enactments</b> <b>of</b> battle scenes in grand opera, for example. Tramagnini was originally a family name in Florence and referred to members of the family who started a gymnastics club and soon wound up appearing on stage in <b>enactments</b> <b>of</b> fighting, both bare-handed and with weapons.|$|R

5|$|Prior to the <b>enactment</b> <b>of</b> Article 100, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted {{during the}} Second Reading of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 2) Bill that the Singapore Constitution had no {{provisions}} for referring questions of constitutional interpretation {{to the courts}} for an advisory ruling, especially those relating to new and complex provisions of the Constitution.

5|$|Since most {{senators}} were former magistrates, {{the senate}} became bound {{together by a}} strong sense of collegiality. At any given point in time, many of the senate's most senior members were ex-Consuls, which facilitated the creation of a bond between the presiding Consul and those senior members. In addition, the Consul was always chosen from senate, and as such he usually held similar ideals as did his fellow senators. When his annual term ended, he returned to their ranks, and so he was unlikely to stand against his fellow senators. Before the <b>enactment</b> <b>of</b> the Ovinian Law, Consuls appointed new senators, but after the <b>enactment</b> <b>of</b> this law, Censors appointed new senators, which caused the senate to become even more independent of the presiding Consul. In addition, the Ovinian Law all but required that ex-magistrates be appointed to the senate, and as such, the process by which Censors appointed new members to the senate became quite objective. This further enhanced the competence, and thus the prestige, of the senate.|$|E

On the 405th anniversary of the city's foundation on June 24, 1976, Manila was reinstated by Marcos as {{the capital of the}} Philippines for its historical significance as the seat of government since the Spanish Period.

40|$|Existing {{literature}} on professional responsibility is characterised by much moral prescription, opinion, {{and concern for}} methods to educate professionals to perform more responsibly.

What ‘responsibilities’ are enacted in these sociomaterial assemblages? How do professionals negotiate the ambivalences of these complex becomings to find lines of ‘responsible’ action? What matters most to professionals in these ‘mattered’ <b>enactments</b> <b>of</b> responsibility...|$|R
