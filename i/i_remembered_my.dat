[...] The Swedish cast was reluctant to disrobe, but in Copenhagen, the tribe thought the nudity too tame and decided to walk naked {{up and down the}} aisle during the show's prelude. In some early performances, the Germans played their scene behind a big sheet labeled [...] "CENSORED". Original Broadway cast member Natalie Mosco said, [...] "I was dead set against the nude scene at first, but <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>my</b> acting teacher having said that part of acting is being private in public. So I did it." [...] According to Melba Moore, [...] "It doesn't mean anything except what you want it to mean. We put so much value on clothing. .... It's like so much else people get uptight about." [...] Donna Summer, who was in the German production, said that [...] "it was not meant to be sexual. ... We stood naked to comment on the fact that society makes more of nudity than killing." [...] Rado said that [...] "being naked in front of an audience, you're baring your soul. [...] Not only the soul but the whole body was being exposed. It was very apt, very honest and almost necessary." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{discovered}} that I {{did not like}} to live on the parlour floor of society. Intellectually I was as bored. Morally and spiritually I was sickened. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>my</b> intellectuals and idealists, my unfrocked preachers, broken professors, and clean-minded, class-conscious working-men. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>my</b> days and nights of sunshine and starshine, where life was all a wild sweet wonder, a spiritual paradise of unselfish adventure and ethical romance. And I saw before me, ever blazing and burning, the Holy Grail.|$|E

6000|$|... "Arthur!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> mother crying {{with the}} strangest break in her voice, [...] "What {{are you doing}} there? Arthur! And--SUNDAY!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and with}} two daughters, Flora and Grizell. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> cousins, good-natured little girls; but Mr. Putney Giles {{tells me that}} the {{shortest}} is six feet high." ...|$|R
60|$|Next came little Mr. Manners, {{stepping}} daintily as ever; and then, as {{the door}} closed with a bang, <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>my</b> errand. They had got halfway to the portico.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because, ladies," [...] I replied, [...] "being {{by nature}} of a timid tongue, and {{compelled}} to say something, and having nothing apt to say, <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>my</b> old Rosinante above in the wood." ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{a little}} wisp of a man, and I shook 'im like a dog shakes a rat. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>my</b> own pocket being picked, and I nearly shook the breath out of 'im.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, let us see. Nay, fear no trick; {{like you}} <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> soul, {{and do not}} stain my hands with blood. Follow me, so you will be safe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I cannot tell you," [...] {{said the}} good man; [...] "only <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> {{father used to}} say that much shall have more and little shall have less." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> father saying. [...] "Yes." [...] And {{then after}} reflection, [...] "But those coolies, those Chinese coolies. You can't build up an {{imperial}} population by importing coolies." ...|$|R
60|$|Just then, for {{an instant}} my mind refused to work swiftly. It was locked round some sense of awful expectancy. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>my</b> camera {{in my hands and}} pointed it where I {{expected}} something wonderful about to happen.|$|E
60|$|How came I to {{have slept}} so long? Vaguely <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>my</b> last night's penance, {{and then came}} a black gulf in my memory, a gap I could not bridge. But {{uppermost}} leapt the anxieties concerning the image of St. Sebastian.|$|E
60|$|I was so {{touched with}} pity for Richard that I could not reproach him any more, even by a look. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>my</b> guardian's {{gentleness}} towards his errors {{and with what}} perfect freedom from resentment he had spoken of them.|$|E
60|$|So <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> {{uncle in}} that first phase, young, but already a little fat, restless, fretful, garrulous, putting in my fermenting head all sorts of {{discrepant}} ideas. Certainly he was educational....|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> do not <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> first lie, {{it is too}} far back; but <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> {{second one}} very well. I was nine days old at the time, and had noticed that if a pin was {{sticking}} in me and I advertised it in the usual fashion, I was lovingly petted and coddled and pitied in a most agreeable way and got a ration between meals besides.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> {{earliest}} view of Manchester. I saw {{the forest}} of chimneys pouring forth volumes of steam and smoke, forming an inky canopy which seemed to embrace and involve the whole place. W. Cooke Taylor ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>my</b> {{anticipation}} {{long ago}} that she would marry a soldier. It was inevitable. She had all the graces of the soldier's wife. She was civil and affable, but she could hardly conceal her intimate conviction {{that she was not}} quite as others were. Robert was breezy.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} I wavered. On {{the one hand}} was the loss of honour with life and liberty and the hope of home, on the other a dreadful end. Then <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>my</b> oath and Otomie, and what she would think of me living or dead, if I did this thing, and I wavered no more.|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{an instant}} I {{was on the}} point of rushing in. The door had been opened to admit the men and their burden. It was the woman who had opened it. But as I stood there she caught a glimpse of me, and I think that she {{recognized}} me. I saw her start, and she hastily closed the door. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>my</b> promise to you, and here I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perfect bear-cats. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> {{grandfather}} {{at the age}} {{of about}} a hundred or something like that spanking me for breaking his pipe. I thought it was a steam-hammer. He was a wonderfully muscular old gentleman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{you will}} dine with Waverley and me on your return? I assure you, Baron, though I can live like a Highlander when needs must, <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> Paris education, and {{understand}} perfectly faire la meilleure chere.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> aunt's first dinner-gown very brightly, and how {{she stood}} before {{the fire in the}} drawing-room confessing once unsuspected pretty arms with all the courage she possessed, and looking over her {{shoulder}} at herself in a mirror.|$|R
60|$|Hurtle's big {{freckled}} hands closed nervously {{over the}} ball. I {{thought it best}} not to say more to him, for he had a rather wild look. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>my</b> own stage fright upon my first appearance in fast company. Besides I knew what my amiable players would say to him. I had a secret hope and belief that presently they would yell upon {{the other side of}} the fence.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was Selingman {{who told}} me," [...] he explained. [...] "Selingman, too, was deceived, but Selingman was nearer to him. He {{discovered}} {{the truth and}} he came to me. It was a matter of two hours ago. I made my way first to Maxendorf. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>my</b> promise. I waited about in the corridors outside his room until I saw an opportunity. Then I slipped in and took him by the throat. Oh, he's alive, but not very much alive to-night!" ...|$|E
60|$|It was the howl of {{starving}} wolves who scent their prey. I spurred {{my horse}} over the meadow-land {{and looked back}} under my arm as I rode. Oh, the glorious moment when {{one after the other}} I saw eight horsemen come over the bank at my heels! Only one had stayed behind, and I heard shouting and the sounds of a struggle. <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>my</b> old sergeant of Chasseurs, and I was sure that number nine would trouble us no more. The road was clear and the Emperor free to continue his journey.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dr. Lee?' asked Felix. 'Tom Underwood {{sent him}} to see <b>my</b> father once. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> father liked him, but called it waste for himself, only longed for his opinion on Cherry. Thank you, I am sure it is the {{greatest}} kindness.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> {{brother-in-law}} {{going for}} a short sea trip once, {{for the benefit of}} his health. He took a return berth from London to Liverpool; and when he got to Liverpool, the only thing he was anxious about was to sell that return ticket.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nothing {{can ever}} alter it; it's in {{the wheels of}} the universe," [...] went on Inglewood, in a low voice: [...] "some men are weak and some strong, and the only {{thing we can do is}} to know that we are weak. I have been in love lots of times, but I could not do anything, for <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>my</b> own fickleness. I have formed opinions, but I haven't the cheek to push them, because I've so often changed them. That's the upshot, old fellow. We can't trust ourselves-- and we can't help it." ...|$|E
60|$|Nor did our {{kindness}} to the Quaker {{end with}} the forty pounds a year, for we were always, while we stayed with her, which was above ten months, giving her one good thing or another; and, in a word, instead of lodging with her, she boarded with us, for I kept the house, and she and all her family ate and drank with us, and yet we paid her the rent of the house too; in short, <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>my</b> widowhood, and I made this widow's heart glad many a day the more upon that account.|$|E
6000|$|My {{first impulse}} was to answer: 'Impossible, Maharajah; we couldn't dream of {{accepting}} your kind invitation.' But on second thoughts, <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>my</b> duty to my proprietor. Journalism first: inclination afterwards! My letter from Egypt on the rescue of the Englishwoman who escaped from Khartoum had brought me great éclat as a special correspondent, and the Daily Telephone now billed my name in big letters on its placards, so Mr. Elworthy wrote me. Here was another noble chance; must I not strive to rise to it? Two English ladies at a native court in Rajputana! that ought to afford scope for some rattling journalism! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ay. When I {{was last}} in England, {{there was a}} great to-do at the {{discovery}} of an engagement between this youth and Miss Georgina. I suppose, considering her bringing-up, she was not much to be blamed. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> aunt thought the poor girl harshly dealt with.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{remember}} {{more of you}} and my Aunt {{than you}} suppose. Even without the photograph (which I am very glad to have--thank you for it), I could have found you and Aunt out in a crowd. I can't say that <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> own generation so well.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I should fear not,' said Arthur. 'I had {{not seen}} or heard of her for some time before I left home, and that is now three years since. She looked very old then, and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>my</b> mother saying she was not fit to come her rounds.' ...|$|R
