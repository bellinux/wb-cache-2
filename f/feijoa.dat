50|$|Acca sellowiana is {{cultivated}} for its edible fruits, {{known as}} <b>feijoas</b> or pineapple guavas.|$|R
50|$|<b>Feijoas</b> may be cool-stored for {{approximately}} {{a month and}} still have a few days of shelf-life at optimum eating maturity. They also may be frozen for up to one year without a loss in quality.|$|R
50|$|It is a warm-temperate to {{subtropical}} {{plant that}} also will {{grow in the}} tropics, but requires at least 50 hours of winter chilling to fruit, and is frost-tolerant. When grown from seed, <b>feijoas</b> are noted for slow growth during their first year or two, and young plants, though cold tolerant, can be sensitive to high wind.|$|R
5000|$|Tibasosa {{is known}} as the {{national}} capital of the Colombian fruit <b>feijoa</b> ...|$|E
50|$|The {{fruit pulp}} resembles the closely related guava, having a gritty texture. The <b>feijoa</b> pulp {{is used in}} some natural {{cosmetic}} products as an exfoliant. <b>Feijoa</b> fruit has a distinctive, potent smell that resembles that of a fine perfume. The aroma {{is due to the}} ester methyl benzoate and related compounds that exist in the fruit.|$|E
50|$|The genera Accara and Acca (formerly <b>Feijoa,</b> {{pineapple}} guava) were formerly {{included in}} Psidium.|$|E
50|$|Its {{green or}} brown larvae are notable for feeding {{at night on}} {{the leaves of the}} kawakawa, Piper excelsum, leaving a {{distinctive}} pattern of holes. They do not feed exclusively on kawakawa, and can also be found on horopito (Pseudowintera sp.), wineberry/makomako (Aristotelia serrata), ramarama (Lophomyrtus sp.), akeake (Dodonea viscosa), and even introduced <b>feijoas</b> (Acca sellowiana).|$|R
50|$|Lira is {{a forest}} village but {{agriculture}} was also important. It can still seen some pastures, corn, potato, or cabbage fields, mainly for home consumption. Every house {{has its own}} garden and orchard: apples, pears, peaches, cherrys, plums,... and recently kiwis or <b>feijoas</b> (pineapple guava). Special mention deserves the vines. Lira {{has always been the}} area of wine. Good quality wine (called Condado) belongs to the Rías Baixas (DO).|$|R
50|$|They {{perform a}} {{valuable}} service in gardens and orchards, eating insects harmful to produce, including aphids, scale insects, and the diamondback moth. However some orchardists, grape growers and home gardeners regard them as a serious pest particularly as, being so small, they simply ignore bird nets, popping in and out through the netting at will. They are attracted {{to a wide range}} of fruit species, including apples, citrus, <b>feijoas,</b> figs, grapes, pears and persimmons.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Feijoa</b> sellowiana Berg is {{from the}} genus which the German botanist, Ernst Berger, named after João da Silva Feijó, a Portuguese naturalist, and the {{specific}} name honors Friedrich Sellow, a German who first collected specimens of <b>feijoa</b> in southern Brazil. It has been nicknamed [...] "pineapple guava", [...] "Brazilian guava", [...] "fig guava" [...] or [...] "guavasteen" [...] among different countries.|$|E
50|$|The <b>feijoa,</b> a {{tree that}} bears green fruits similar to guavas, is named after him.|$|E
50|$|Acca lanuginosa is {{a species}} of shrub in the Myrtaceae family, related to <b>feijoa.</b> It is endemic to Peru.|$|E
50|$|<b>Feijoas</b> are {{occasionally}} {{found as}} landscape plants in Texas, Florida, and California. They {{can succeed in}} greenhouses in temperate parts of the United States, and have been grown in-ground as fruiting trees on the United States east coast in coastal Georgia and South Carolina {{as well as in}} California. Other regions of the United States: the Pacific Northwest, the southernmost Appalachian Mountains, and the immediate coastal region from North Carolina to Delaware all would warrant further investigation.|$|R
5000|$|In the Northern Hemisphere, {{this species}} has been {{cultivated}} {{as far north}} as western Scotland, but under such conditions it does not fruit every year, as winter temperatures below approximately [...] kill the flower buds. Summer temperatures above [...] may also have an adverse effect upon fruit set. <b>Feijoas</b> are somewhat tolerant of drought and salt in soils, though fruit production can be adversely affected. Tolerant to partial shade, regular watering is essential while fruit is maturing.|$|R
25|$|Fukuoka's farm in Shikoku {{was taken}} over by his son and daughter-in-law in the late 1980s, as Fukuoka reached an {{advanced}} age and his grandson also took up farming. Many of the farm's iyokan and amanatsu mikan trees remain, although some old iyokan were replaced by new varieties of fruit. Woodlands remain along with orchards, including some areas of wild vegetables still growing amongst them. Some areas of straw-mulched cropping continue to produce grains and vegetables. The farm also features an orchard area of ginkgo trees, shiitake mushroom crops growing on tree logs in shady woodland, and plantings of limes, grapefruits, <b>feijoas,</b> avocados and mangoes.|$|R
50|$|Acca (formerly <b>Feijoa)</b> is a genus of {{shrubs and}} small {{trees in the}} Myrtaceae family, first {{described}} as a genus in 1856.|$|E
5000|$|Tropical and {{subtropical}} plants - Cajanus cajan, Cucurbita foetidissima, Dracaena draco, Erythrina crista-galli, <b>Feijoa</b> sellowiana, Persea americana, Plumeria alba, Psophocarpus tetragonolobus, and Tamarillo.|$|E
50|$|In the South Caucasus, <b>feijoa</b> {{has been}} {{cultivated}} {{in the southern}} coastal region of Azerbaijan since 1928; cultivation in neighboring Georgia has gradually increased to about 988 hectares in 1986.|$|E
2500|$|A {{combination}} of the climate and soils in the area has always made Te Puke a popular area for horticulture. From the 1880s tobacco was grown commercially but petered out in the late 1930s. Trial plantings of hops, and later rice, were also tried. Viticulture was also tried and found to be successful but for various reasons also died out. The settlers had established home orchards when finance permitted and {{it was found that}} pip and citrus fruits flourished. From this, the first commercial orchard in Te Puke was planted in 1915. Commercial plantings were of apples, pears, oranges, lemons and grapefruit. After World War Two, the Rehabilitation Department settled returned servicemen on the No 3 Road as orchardists. Followed by others with their own finance, most of No 3 Road was in orchards by 1960. By 1966, 80 owners owned about 1500 acres (6km²) of land of which [...] was in citrus and balance in sub-tropical fruit including tamarillos (tree tomatoes) and <b>feijoas.</b> In 1934 Jim MacLoughlin had bought a [...] lemon and passionfruit orchard in No 3 Road. His neighbour Vic Bayliss had two Chinese gooseberry plants and he had sold the fruit for £5! Spurred on by this Jim planted ½ acre of Chinese gooseberries in 1937. During World War II, American serviceman in New Zealand were introduced to the Chinese gooseberry and enjoyed it so much that this spurred further plantings. In 1952 the first exports were made, and in 1959 the name “Kiwifruit” was introduced. Since then many more plantings have been made with Hayward (green) being the most popular. In 1998 “Zespri Gold” kiwifruit was introduced to the market and experiments are being carried out on new varieties including a peelable kiwifruit and [...] "kiwiberry", a small bite-sized kiwifruit-like fruit.|$|R
50|$|Main {{economical}} {{activities of}} Sotaquirá are agriculture (barley, beans, potatoes, maize, peas and fruits as peaches, pear, prunes, apples, blackberries, strawberries, curuba, tree tomatoes and <b>feijoa),</b> livestock and dairy farming.|$|E
50|$|A <b>feijoa</b> {{may be used}} as an {{interesting}} addition to a fruit smoothie, and may be used to make wine or cider and feijoa-infused vodka. The flavour is aromatic, strong and complex, inviting comparison with guava, strawberry, pineapple, and often containing a faint wintergreen-like aftertaste. It also is possible to buy <b>feijoa</b> yogurt, fruit drinks, jam, ice cream, and such in New Zealand. It also may be cooked and used in dishes where one would use stewed fruit. It is a popular ingredient in chutney. The very strong, complex flavour can make using feijoas, in combination with other fruits or vegetables, a creative and complex undertaking.|$|E
50|$|Jono and Ben {{made their}} own {{flavours}} of V drinks, which were announced on their TV show. Both are limited edition: The red can, Jono, is a cranberry flavour, while the white can, Ben, is a more tart <b>feijoa</b> flavour.|$|E

50|$|Main {{economical}} {{activities of}} Tibasosa are dairy farming, agriculture {{and on a}} lesser scale mining. Agricultural products are wheat, potatoes, maize, barley, arracacha, ruba, ibia, turnips, peas, beans, onions, apples, pears, prunes, oranges, peaches, cherries, figs and Colombian fruits as <b>feijoa,</b> chirimoya, guama, cañahuate and mortiño. The daily milk production of Tibasosa was 22,000 liters in February 2016.|$|E
50|$|Ripe {{fruit is}} prone to bruising; {{difficulty}} maintaining the fruit in good condition {{for any length of}} time, along with the short period of optimum ripeness and full flavor, probably explains why feijoas frequently are not exported, and where grown commercially, are typically sold close to the source of the crop. However, intercontinental shipping of <b>feijoa</b> by sea or air has been successful.|$|E
5000|$|Formerly {{included}} in the genera Myrtus and Psidium, Accara differs from both the latter in embryo structure, and from the former in being pentamerous (having its parts in fives) and in bud structure. The generic name is an anagram of the type location, Caraça, and {{is similar to the}} presumably closely related genus of Acca, nowadays sometimes {{included in}} <b>Feijoa.</b>|$|E
