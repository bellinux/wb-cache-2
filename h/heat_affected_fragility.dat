40|$|The rolling-mill back-up rolls {{operate under}} high {{specific}} pressures conditions and are produced of high-carbon steel, prone to {{hot and cold}} cracking. Therefore crack resistance increase is an important scientific and technical problem. The impact of the electrode shape and heat input on the arc motion, and <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zone, the size of which determines the cold cracks formation and deposited metal flaking has been found. The arc moves along the electrode end face along the longitudinal axis or perpendicular to the weld pool in dependence on the ribbon position. The arc movement governs the heat input in the pool and if the surfacing regime is constant, the heating and cooling rates of the molten metal and <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zone as well. At surfacing with a perpendicular ribbon the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zone decreases; at surfacing with a longitudinal ribbon and wire the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zone increases. At surfacing with a composite electrode the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zone reduces sharply while resistance to cracking and wearing increases. With the heat input reduction in weld pool side edges the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zone reduces as well. At high speed surfacing with low heat input, the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zone reduces, the tendency to cold cracking and deposited metal flaking decrease, welding stresses and specific pressure decrease, what results in resistance to cracking increase {{as well as the}} increase in wearing resistance.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work has been to {{investigate}} the ultimate capacities of aluminium plates. The aluminium plates {{are supposed to be}} part of a marine structure. Their behaviour has been explored by taking advantage of non-linear finite element simulations. The loading conditions included axial compression, transverse compression, pure shear loading, axial compression in combination with transverse compression and axial compression in combination with shear loading. Different patterns of <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zones have been studied with particular attention on conventionally welded plates and extruded, welded plates. The plates have been given realistic boundary conditions in addition to boundary conditions believed to represent the extremities in plate collapse behaviour. The initial deflection patterns chosen, were generally conservative, and the variations in collapse capacities for different initial deflection patterns have been investigated. The initial deflection amplitudes were systematically varied to cover all values of the initial deflection amplitudes likely to occur. In addition to studying different patterns of the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zones, systematic variations of the breadths of the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zones have been performed. Systematic variations in the magnitudes of the residual stresses and systematic variations of the reductions of the 0. 2 percent tensile proof stresses in the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zones have also been carried out. Three different aluminium alloys were studied. They were believed to represent a high, medium and low utilised aluminium alloy. The aspect ratio of the plates was varied to cover both plates that were completely square to plates with a length equal to five times the breadth of the plates. It was found that axially loaded plates with <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zones along loaded edges had lower ultimate capacities than plates with <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zones along unloaded edges, and if the plates had <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zones along loaded edges, having additional <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zones along unloaded edges did not alter the buckling capacities. The reduction in ultimate capacity could be modelled to vary linearly with the breadth of the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zones, and the reduction in ultimate capacity could be modelled to vary linearly with the relationship between the value of the 0. 2 percent tensile proof stress in the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zones and the 0. 2 percent tensile proof stress of the base material. The ultimate capacities of transversally loaded plates could be found as the sum of a square plate and a plate strip, even if the plates contained <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zones. Square plates and plate strips with relevant patterns of <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zones had to be employed. Biaxial interaction curves showed a considerable slenderness dependence for all values of the aspect ratio investigated. The biaxial interaction curves were only slightly affected by introduction of different patterns of <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zones. The stress corresponding to equal elastic and plastic strain was better suited as the normalising stress than the more commonly used 0. 2 percent tensile proof stress. One design curve could be used to represent all the different aluminium alloys investigated. Changing the aluminium alloy did not change the shape of the biaxial interaction curves. Based on the detailed study of the collapse behaviour of aluminium plates carried out, and established practice, new ULS design formulas for axial compression, transverse compression, pure shear loading, axial compression in combination with transverse compression and axial compression in combination with shear loading were proposed. The new design formulas accounted for reductions in ultimate capacities due to <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zones, including <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zones along loaded edges. They took full advantage of non-linear residual strength for slender plates; and the slenderness dependence and aspect ratio dependence for biaxial interaction curves were systematically incorporated. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

To obtain experimental database for the artificial neural network training, laser cutting experiment was planned as per Taguchi’s L 27 orthogonal array with three levels for each of the cutting parameter.

It is shown that a double pulse weld scheme leads to an enhancement in cross-tension strength compared to single pulse welding. The second pulse subdivides the initial fusion zone of the first pulse into two zones. The inner part is solidified with a columnar structure after the second pulse, whereas with the second pulse the outer layer becomes recrystallized (named as Rex-zone) leading {{to the formation of}} an equiaxed structure of prior austenite grains. Characteristics of martensite formed in the Rex-zone and coarse-grained <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> zone, where the crack initiated and propagated, were investigated using orientation imaging microscopy.
