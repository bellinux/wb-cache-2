This could create considerable uncertainty regarding the validity of proceedings conducted on the basis of evidence obtained as a result of such searches. It could also give rise to delictual claims by persons subjected to searches and seizures after that date, adding further burdens to a health budget already under considerable strain.|$|R

Among the persons underwent the collisions there were 1, 5 % of railroaders and 1 / 3 of them died and the rest had traumata and injuries. The amount of traumatism among male railroaders constitutes 5, 8 per 100 of the workers (or 8, 5 % to the total), the amount of the day of disability constitute 99, 7 per 100 of the workers (or 14, 8 % to the total) and the average length of one case is 9, 9 days. Traumatism on the railway transport {{is one of the}} main reasons of primary invalidity and determines nearly 15 % of all cases of stable loss of ability to work/ The majority of the persons with traumata (87, 2 %) began and finished their treatment in ambulances and policlinics. This points to the leading role of these health care institutions both in the organization of medical aid at traumata and in its prophylaxis...|$|R

40|$|Para o desenvolvimento do tema, analisou-se a possibilidade de fixação de um conceito geral de invalidades, aplicável a todos os ramos do Direito. Tratou-se das especificidades das invalidades processuais, bem como de seu conceito e abrangência. Os principais critérios doutrinários para sistematização dos vícios dos atos processuais foram examinados como método auxiliar da elaboração da proposta de sistematização que compõe o objeto do presente estudo. A teoria das invalidades sofreu o impacto da acertada preocupação de que o processo não deve servir a seus próprios fins. Firmada essa concepção, nota-se uma dedicação à tarefa de realçar os limites deste aspecto instrumental, de modo a questionar a possibilidade de o exame da irrelevância do vício processual se dar pelo enfoque exclusivo de critérios exteriores à relação jurídica processual. Atualmente, a cláusula do devido processo legal incorpora a axiologia das garantias fundamentais do indivíduo, explicitando que são indispensáveis as garantias inerentes ao processo. A resolução da crise de direito {{material}} deve lançar efeitos sobre os vícios que acarretem transgressão de tais garantias, mas uma teoria das invalidades deve estar sustentada nos referenciais processuais, não podendo condicionar-se, exclusivamente, ao resultado final do processo, {{dado que}} lhe é externo. Assim, o enfoque classificatório adotado para sistematização dos vícios da sentença civil procura assentar-se sobre as regras e princípios do processo, notadamente porque se reconhece que o respeito ao direito material e ao direito processual equiparam-se em importância para que se obtenha uma decisão justa. A inexistência da sentença foi examinada sob os aspectos da decisão proferida em processo juridicamente inexistente ou pela ausência de seus elementos intrínsecos. Ao final, examinou-se a casuística relativa à sentença inválida, como aquela dada em processo com irregular constituição do juiz ou com defeito de fundamentação. Aiming {{to develop the}} theme, the analysis {{on the possibility of}} setting a <b>general</b> concept of <b>invalidities,</b> applicable to all the areas of Law was analyzed. The specificities, concept and scope of procedural invalidities were addressed. The main juristic criteria used to systematize the defects of procedural acts were analyzed as an auxiliary method for preparing the systematization proposal that comprises the subject matter of this study. The theory of invalidities was impacted by the appropriate concern about the procedure not being used as means to suit its own purpose. After establishing this concept, there is the focus on underlining the limits of this instrumental aspect to question whether the possibility of the analysis on the irrelevance of the procedural defect is focused solely on criteria that is external to the procedural legal relationship. Currently, the section of the due process of law incorporates the axiology of individual fundamental guarantees, making explicit that the guarantees inherent to the procedure are fundamental. The solution for the crisis of substantive law should impact the defects that lead to the violation of such guarantees. However, the theory of invalidities should be grounded on procedural references, and not be exclusively dependent on the final result of the process, since such theory is external to it. Accordingly, the focus on classification adopted to systematize the defects of the civil judgment intends to have as base the rules and principles of the process, since it is known that the respect toward substantive law and procedural law are of equal importance in reaching a just decision. The inexistence of the judgment was reviewed based on the aspects of the decision granted in a process that does not exist in legal terms or by the absence of its intrinsic elements. Finally, there was the analysis of case histories related to the invalid judgment, such as the judgment of a procedure with irregular constitution of the court or with defect of reasons...|$|R
