60|$|LIZA [wounded, {{getting away}} from him {{to the other side}} of the ottoman with her face to the hearth] <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> you brute. You wanted to get rid of me.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was in a}} {{thorough}} brotherly and Christian spirit that before entering the house he compelled himself to say, 'Don't vex yourself, Phoebe, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> the best you could. It made no real difference, and it was best that she should know the truth.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no, Mr Noggs,' replied Gride, arresting his hand, 'A lady. You wonder {{to hear me}} say A lady. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Here's little Madeline. That's the toast. Mr Noggs. Little Madeline!' ...|$|R
60|$|VALENTINE (smiling). To spoil it? You {{mean that}} you sought to flirt even with me. Ah, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> But that is nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>you</b> would <b>do</b> me a kindness,' {{proceeded}} Guy, 'you {{would just}} say <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not mean it. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not, but if you would only say so.' ...|$|R
60|$|Boab. Grant that I did the unjust {{injunction}} lay, You {{should have}} loved {{me more than}} to obey. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> this mutiny design; But I'll your love-plot quickly countermine. Let my crown go; he never shall return; I, like a phoenix, in my nest will burn.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> your best. For {{an amateur}} you did wonderfully well. But amateurs never really succeed. There were a dozen little easy {{precautions}} which we neglected to take. What {{we want is}} a professional; a man whose business is kidnapping; {{the sort of man}} who kidnaps as a matter of course; someone like Smooth Sam Fisher.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Barrington nodded, {{and then}} made a little {{impatient}} gesture. [...] "There was something unpleasant, but my memory seems to be going, and my sister has forgiven you. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{a good deal for}} us at Silverdale, and showed yourself a match for the best of them in the city. That pleases me. By and by, you will take hold here after me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, now, Cousin Florence," [...] said Edward, [...] "you are {{a girl of}} {{moderately}} good sense, {{with all}} your nonsense. Now don't <b>you</b> (<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do)</b> think just so too?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Sir Mart. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> sir, and {{therefore}} I hope you'll think never the worse of me for his prating: For, though I do not boast {{of my own}} good parts---- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! you are cruel," [...] she exclaimed. [...] "You want to {{take him}} from me; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do!</b> He promised--to marry me--before you came. He must marry me! I dare not go home!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you did;--didn't you now?" [...] She {{shook her}} head, {{but there was}} {{something}} almost of playfulness in her manner of doing it. [...] "Ah, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> And why shouldn't you speak out, now that we are to be man and wife? I like a girl to speak out. I suppose if I want to be with you, you want as much to be with me; eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How could I manage it?" [...] Terence said, indignantly. [...] "No, no, O'Grady; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{make some}} remark about that scare at Athlone, {{and said it}} would be fun to have one here. I was a little shocked at hearing such a thing from, as you often say, a {{superior}} officer, and it certainly appears to me that it was you who first broached the idea. So I have much more right to feel a suspicion that you had a hand in the carrying of it out than for you to suspect me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{must have}} been hard to give up what you did," [...] said Hetty, with a diffidence that was unusual in her. [...] "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> it willingly, but you must have found it was very {{different}} from what you expected. I mean that the men you wanted to smooth the way for had their notions too, and meant to do a good deal that could never please you. Suppose you found they didn't want to go along quietly, making this country better, but only to trample down whatever was there already?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you really}} thought it {{positively}} wrong," [...] proceeded Caroline, [...] "not another word would I say: but I don't {{see how you}} can without condemning all gaeties, and that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't see it yet," [...] {{said the}} Doctor. [...] "But <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> And she shall stay. The house shall be hers, as her residence, {{for the next}} six months. As for money----" ...|$|R
5000|$|V najbolj preprosti obliki ti povem, ker vem, da ne razumeš dobro: spelji se mi izpred oči. (I {{tell you}} in the {{simplest}} form, for <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not understand well: {{get out of my}} sight.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, don't you see? But if I {{could have}} {{answered}} {{you as you}} wish, it wouldn't have been anything to give up everything for you. A woman isn't something else first, and a woman afterwards. I understand how unselfishly you meant, and indeed, indeed, I thank you. But don't let's talk of it any more. It couldn't have been, {{and there is nothing}} but misery in thinking of it. Come," [...] she said, with a struggle for cheerfulness, [...] "let us forget it. Let it be just as if you hadn't spoken to me; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> n't intend to do it; and let us go on as if nothing had happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{should have}} been with me when, as I jumped on shore at Mota, I took Paraskloi's father by the hand. That dear lad I baptized as he lay in his shroud in the chapel, when the whole weight of the trial seemed, as it were, by a sudden revelation to {{manifest}} itself, and thoroughly overwhelmed and unnerved me. I got through the service with the tears streaming down my cheeks, and my voice half choked. He was his father's pride, some seventeen years old. A girl ready chosen for him as his wife. [...] "It is all well, Bishop, he died well. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> all you could, it is all well." [...] He trembled all over, {{and his face was}} wet with tears; but he seemed strangely drawn to us, and if he survives this present epidemic, his son's death may be to him the means in God's hands of an eternal life. Most touching, is it not, this entire confidence? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My third plan {{seems to}} me the most feasible. You all saw a number of large, heavy boxes lowered into the hold before we sailed. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> because you asked me what they {{contained}} and commented upon the large letter 'H' which was painted upon each box. These boxes contain the various parts of a hydro-aeroplane. I purpose assembling this upon the strip of beach described in Bowen's manuscript--the beach where he found the dead body of the apelike man--provided there is sufficient space above high water; otherwise we shall have to assemble it on deck and lower it over the side. After it is assembled, I shall carry tackle and ropes to the cliff-top, and then it will be comparatively simple to hoist the search-party and its supplies in safety. Or I can make a sufficient number of trips to land the entire party in the valley beyond the barrier; all will depend, of course, upon what my first reconnaissance reveals." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you make}} all the judges and {{senators}} and congressmen in the state, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Why," [...] exclaimed Cynthia, indignantly, [...] "why does Mr. Sutton say the people elected him when he owes everything to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have. You want to {{get excited}} in love. You want to be carried away in love. You want to whoosh off in a nice little love whoosh and love yourself. Don't deny it. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> want passion to sweep you off on wings of fire till you surpass yourself, and like the {{swooping}} eagle swoop right into the sun. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you,</b> my love-boy." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> what <b>you</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It's not {{my place}} to blame you, <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>You</b> <b>did</b> it, I suppose, {{as you say}} so, {{for me and my}} mother. But it IS my place to tell you plainly, father, that I, for one, will have nothing at all to do with the fruits of your deception. I was no party to the fraud; I will be no party either to its results or its {{clearing}} up. I, too, have to think, as you say, of my mother. For her sake, I won't urge you to break her heart at once by disinheriting her son, now and here, too openly. You can make what arrangements you like with these blood-sucking Warings. You can do as you will in providing them with hush-money. Let them take their black-mail! You've handed them over half the sum you got for Dowlands already, I suppose. You can buy them off for awhile by handing them over the remainder. Twelve thousand will do. Leeches as they are, that will surely content them, at least for the present." ...|$|E
6000|$|MR. RICHARDS: [...] "Yes, I {{understand}} that, perfectly. I am now asking {{merely for}} general information. I {{do not expect}} you to relent, and, in fact, I should consider it rather frivolous if you did. No. What I have always admired in your character, Lucy, is a firm, logical consistency; a clearness of mental vision that leaves no side of a subject unsearched; and an unwavering constancy of purpose. You may say that these traits are characteristic of ALL women; but they are pre-eminently characteristic of you, Lucy." [...] Miss Galbraith looks askance at him, to make out whether he is in earnest or not; he continues, with a perfectly serious air. [...] "And I know now that if you're offended with me, it's for no trivial cause." [...] She stirs uncomfortably in her chair. [...] What I have done I can't imagine, {{but it must be}} something monstrous, since it has made life with me appear so impossible that you are ready to fling away your own happiness-- for <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>DID</b> love me, Lucy--and destroy mine. I will begin with the worst thing I can think of. Was it because I danced so much with Fanny Watervliet?" ...|$|E
60|$|Dearest, naughtiest Mona Nina,--Where is {{the place}} of your soul, your body abiding at Brighton, that never, no, never, do I hear from you? It seems hard. Last summer I was near to {{slipping}} out of the world, and then, except for a rap, you might have called on me in vain (and said rap you wouldn't have believed in). Also, even this winter, even in this Rome, the city of refuge, I have had an attack, less long and sharp, indeed, but weakening, and, though I am well now, and have corrected the proofs of a very thin and wicked 'brochure' on Italian affairs (in verse, of course), yet still I am not too strong for cod-liver oil and the affectionateness of such friends as you (I speak as if I had a shoal of such friends--povera mi!). Write to me, therefore. Especially as the English critics will worry me alive for my book {{and you will have}} to say, 'Well done, critics!' so write before you read it, to say, 'Ba, I love you.' That makes up for everything. Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> write to me in the summer. And then I wrote to you; and then there came a pause, which is hard on me, I repeat.|$|E
6000|$|... "You dear, foolish person," [...] she laughed, [...] "that was good, not evil. You like me, don't <b>you?</b> But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> There is one crime {{you have}} always {{forgotten}} to develop--you haven't the simplest idea in the world how to lie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Beatrice," [...] {{she said}} gently, [...] "I {{want to know}} what the trouble is. You can't hide it from me that {{something}} is wrong. I've noticed it for some time. You don't eat anything and you cry all night--oh, yes, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> What is it, dear?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} think that I have laid my soul bare {{in the hope of}} {{changing}} your mind in regard to Gertrude. I recognize clearly, now, that that is impossible. Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not so misjudge me," [...] she added, reading his quick protest in his face.|$|R
6000|$|But not {{apparently}} {{in a very}} satisfied mood. After {{a few moments of}} purely mechanical memoranda-making, he rose abruptly and opened a small drawer in a cabinet, from which he took a letter still in its envelope. It bore a foreign postmark. Glancing over it hastily, his eyes at last became fixed on a concluding paragraph. [...] "I hope," [...] wrote his correspondent, [...] "that even in the rush of your big business you will sometimes look after Barker. Not that I think the dear old chap will ever go wrong--indeed, I often wish I was as certain of myself as of him and his insight; but I am afraid we were more inclined to be merely amused and tolerant of his wonderful trust and simplicity than to really understand it for his own good and ours. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not like his marriage, and were inclined to believe he was the victim of a rather unscrupulous father and a foolish, unequal girl; but are you satisfied that he would have been the happier without it, or lived his perfect life under other and what you may think wiser conditions? If he WROTE the poetry that he LIVES everybody would think him wonderful; for being what he is we never give him sufficient credit." [...] Stacy smiled grimly, and penciled on his memorandum, [...] "He wants it to the amount of ten thousand dollars." [...] "Anyhow," [...] continued the writer, [...] "look after him, Jim, for his sake, your sake, and the sake of--PHIL DEMOREST." ...|$|E
5000|$|One of {{his early}} {{appearances}} as a leading actor was seen by Alec Guinness, who said to him afterwards, [...] "You were very good.The Times said so. I read their review. And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> - because you were playing the review, rather than the part! Promise me you will stop reading reviews." [...] Meacher stopped reading drama criticism.|$|E
5000|$|Brown {{has been}} in custody since September 12, 2012. His mother was sentenced on November 8, 2013 to six months of {{probation}} and a $1,000 fine for a misdemeanor charge of obstructing the execution of a search warrant. [...] "My better judgment was clouded by my maternal instinct," [...] she stated in court. The judge said to her, [...] "I feel for you, as a parent. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> the best you could." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I know,' {{continued}} I, 'Mrs. Hoggarty's peculiarities {{as well as}} anyone, madam; {{and aware}} that those and her education are not such as to make her a fit companion for <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not like her: she has written to us in Somersetshire that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not like her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was {{a little}} {{disappointed}} in her début, and much interested in her success. She was rather a favourite of mine in Paris, so I invited her to the Alhambra yesterday, with Claudius Piggott and some more. I had half a mind to pull <b>you</b> in, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not much admire Piggott.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Solemn {{thoughts}} on this day, an Ordination Sunday, mingle with the joy at the coming of this messenger (I trust of mercy and peace). I need not ask you to pray continually for us, for <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> so. But indeed, {{now is the time}} when we seem especially to need your prayers.|$|R
