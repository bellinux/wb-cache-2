If adding modalities representing product update to a language does not alter its expressive power then we say that the language is "closed <b>for</b> <b>product</b> update. " The basic modal language {{is known to be}} closed <b>for</b> <b>product</b> update. We establish that monadic second order logic is closed <b>for</b> <b>product</b> update (Theorem 5).

5|$|After {{making his}} debut as Hughie Grant in the Oxford-financed Privileged (1982), Grant dabbled {{in a variety}} of jobs, such as working as an {{assistant}} groundsman at Fulham Football Club, tutoring, writing comedy sketches for TV shows, and working for Talkback Productions to write and produce radio commercials <b>for</b> <b>products</b> such as Mighty White bread and Red Stripe lager. To obtain his Equity card, he joined the Nottingham Playhouse, a regional theatre, and lived for a year at Park Terrace in The Park Estate. Bored with small acting parts, he created his own comedy revue called The Jockeys of Norfolk, a name taken from Shakespeare's Richard III, with friends Chris Lang and Andy Taylor. The group toured London's pub comedy circuit with stops at The George IV in Chiswick, Canal Cafe Theatre in Little Venice and The King's Head in Islington. Starting on a low note, The Jockeys of Norfolk eventually proved a hit at the Edinburgh Festival after their sketch on the Nativity, told as an Ealing comedy, gained them a spot on the BBC2 TV show called Edinburgh Nights. During this time, Grant also appeared in theatre productions of plays such as An Inspector Calls (at the Royal Exchange, Manchester), Lady Windermere's Fan, and Coriolanus.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs <b>for</b> <b>products</b> {{such as the}} Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, {{the film}} was written by Randy Kornfield. Producer Chris Columbus rewrote the script, adding in {{elements}} of satire about the commercialization of Christmas, and the project {{was picked up by}} 20th Century Fox. Delays on Fox's reboot of Planet of the Apes allowed Schwarzenegger to come on board the film, while Columbus opted to cast Sinbad ahead of Joe Pesci as Myron. Jingle All the Way was set and filmed in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul at a variety of locations, including the Mall of America. After five weeks filming, production moved to California where scenes such as the end parade were shot. The film's swift production meant merchandising was limited to a replica of the Turbo-Man action figure used in the film.|$|E

His early work {{involved}} advertisements for brands including Bajaj, Ponds, Fair and Lovely and TVS, before signing a major endorsing deal with Pepsi and marketing company, IMG. In 2007, Madhavan endorsed UniverCell, a multi-brand mobile phone retail chain owned by UniverCell Telecommunications India Pvt Ltd. Madhavan {{signed a contract}} with the mobile phone network, Airtel for promotions in South India before being promoted as the pan-Indian ambassador for the brand a year later. His advertisements with Vidya Balan for Airtel won critical acclaim, and brought in film offers for the pair to feature together. In June 2010, marketers from Arun Excello promoted a housing project in Oragadam, Chennai in a similar fashion to the release of a new film featuring Madhavan. With film-inspired posters and billboards put up around Chennai, the advertisement campaign attracted huge curiosity and the project became a success. His long-term work with jewellery brand, Joy Alukkas, led to the company creating life size wax models of him to place in their showrooms from January 2011. Maruti Suzuki, for whom Madhavan is the brand ambassador, launched a special edition of the Suzuki Wagon R car calling it the Madhavan Signature Edition in September 2013.

40|$|The {{reference}} price system in Slovenia is {{used with the}} aim of managing and reducing public expenditures <b>for</b> medicinal <b>products.</b> We aim to investigate whether the {{reference price}} system has had an effect on real price reductions <b>for</b> medicinal <b>products.</b> We present the reference price regulation system <b>for</b> medicinal <b>products</b> and empirically estimate the effect of price regulation on the development of real prices <b>for</b> medicinal <b>products</b> and its economic rationale. The main thesis that the nominal and real prices <b>for</b> medicinal <b>products</b> have declined during price regulation is revealed by the Laspeyres index and Wilcoxon signed ranks test, by confirming the existence of statistically significant differences in prices <b>for</b> medicinal <b>products.</b> Therefore, we adopt the alternative hypothesis that prices <b>for</b> medicinal <b>products</b> have declined during the price regulation system. The reference price regulation system, with an efficient use of medicinal products and their efficient supply, could have positive effects on management and reduction of public expenditure <b>for</b> medicinal <b>products.</b> prices <b>for</b> medicinal <b>products,</b> price regulation <b>for</b> medicinal <b>products,</b> reference price system, Slovenia...|$|R
