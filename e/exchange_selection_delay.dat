40|$|International audienceWe analyze {{here the}} {{evolutionary}} consequences of <b>selection</b> with <b>delay</b> {{in a population}} genetics context. In the classical works on evolutionary dynamics, an individual produces off-springs {{in direct proportion to}} its fitness, a process in which mutations may occur. In the present scenario of <b>delayed</b> <b>selection,</b> individuals that acquire deleterious mutations can still reproduce unharmed for several generations. During this time delay, the damage passed on to off-springs can potentially be repaired by subsequent compensatory mutations. In the absence of such a repair, the individual becomes sterile. Here we study the population-genetic effects of such a time delay by means of both numerical simulations and theoretical modeling. The results show that <b>delayed</b> <b>selection</b> lowers the extinction threshold, endangering the survival of the population. Surprisingly, however, no traces of this delay effect are encountered in the sequence diversity of the population. These conclusions suggest that <b>delayed</b> <b>selection</b> is hard to detect in genetic data and thus could be a wide-spread but rarely detected phenomenon...|$|R

50|$|If all {{genes are}} in linkage equilibrium, {{the effect of}} an allele at one locus can be {{averaged}} across the gene pool at other loci. In reality, one allele is frequently found in linkage disequilibrium with genes at other loci, especially with genes located nearby on the same chromosome. Recombination breaks up this linkage disequilibrium too slowly to avoid genetic hitchhiking, where an allele at one locus rises to high frequency because it is linked to an allele under selection at a nearby locus. Linkage also slows down the rate of adaptation, even in sexual populations. The effect of linkage disequilibrium in slowing down the rate of adaptive evolution arises {{from a combination of}} the Hill-Robertson effect (delays in bringing beneficial mutations together) and background <b>selection</b> (<b>delays</b> in separating beneficial mutations from deleterious hitchhikers).|$|R

40|$|Proactive self-configuration {{is crucial}} for MANETs such as sensor networks, as these are often {{deployed}} in hostile environments and are ad hoc in nature. The dynamic architecture of the network is monitored by exchanging so-called Network State Beacons (NSBs) between key network nodes.

It is thus essential to optimize these parameters for the dynamic load profile of the network.

Banzhaf refutes arguments against downward causation much as Samuel Johnson kicks a stone to refute Berkeley — by pointing to concrete examples in genetic programming, such as the growth of repetitive patterns within programs. Repetitive patterns are theoretically predicted to emerge from the evolution of evolvability and robustness under subtree <b>exchange.</b> <b>Selection</b> and genetic operators are co-equal creators of these emergent phenomena. GP systems entirely formal, and thus their emergent phenomena are essentially mathematical. The emergence of Lagrangian distributions for tree shapes under subtree exchange, for example, gives a glimpse of the possibilities for mathematical understanding of emergence in GP.

The objective of this work was to estimate the genetic variances of vegetative phase transition and its correlation with yield and its components. Full-sib and half-sib families were developed in a maize synthetic, following the Design I mating system.

40|$|Negotiations {{often take}} long a time {{even if a}} delay in the {{agreement}} is inefficient. One typical explanation is the existence of private information {{of at least one}} party; the time is then a discriminating instrument. The paper starts by pointing out that this result does not hold once the traded quantity is not fixed as in most bargaining models; the quantity outperforms the time as a discriminating instrument, that is, there is no delay. Moreover, Coase conjecture does not hold either. We then study how a signal arriving in the course of negotiations affects the delay in the agreement. Unlike investment-under-uncertainty models, a better signal not only improves contracting in the future but also in the present. Therefore, the delay is in general not monotonic in the quality of information. The value of information can be negative over some range as better information may aggravate the principal`s commitment problem.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{analytical}} framework {{for determining the}} outage probability of random and best relay selection schemes given a Poisson field of relay nodes {{and the presence of}} path loss and fading. For relay selection, relays geographically close to the source and destination are preferred to others. This selection guideline ensures a target quality of service (QoS) and reduces the signaling overhead and the relay <b>selection</b> <b>delay.</b> A spatial region called the QoS region is obtained for the random relay selection and is shown to shrink as the distance between the source and the destination increases and the interfering node density increases. When the QoS region for random relay selection is not large enough and cannot probabilistically ensure a reliable relay therein, the best relay selection is employed since the required relay node density and selection range for a desired QoS can be reduced for the best relay selection. The gain of the best relay selection with respect to the random relay selection is quantified in terms of relay node density reduction and coverage extension due to selection diversity. © 2011 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|<b>Delay</b> <b>selection</b> {{for time}} series phase space {{reconstruction}} may be performed using a mutual information (MI) criterion. However, the <b>delay</b> <b>selection</b> {{is in that}} case limited to the estimation of a single delay using MI between two variables only. A high-dimensional estimator of the MI {{may be used to}} select more than one delay between more than two variables but this approach is rather time consuming. In this paper, an alternative fast criterion is proposed to optimize all delays for a high-dimensional phase space reconstruction: the distance-to-diagonal (DD) criterion, based on a geometrical heuristic. The use of the distance to diagonal criterion is illustrated and compared to MI on artificial and benchmark time series. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
