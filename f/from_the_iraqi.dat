50|$|Instead {{of seeing}} every Iraqi as a {{potential}} enemy, COIN strategy focused on building relationships and getting cooperation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> against Al Qaeda and minimizing the number of enemies for US forces. The belief was that maintaining a long term presence of troops in a community improves security and allows for relationships and trust to develop between the locals and the US military. Civilian casualties are minimized by carefully measured use of force. This means less bombing and overwhelming fire-power, and more soldiers using restraint and even sometimes taking more risk in the process.|$|R
