In the case of migratory movement, most members of a shoal seem to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> going. In the case of foraging behaviour, captive shoals of golden shiner (a kind of minnow) are led by a small number of experienced individuals who knew when and where food was available.|$|E
25|$|Many street {{children}} spend 300 rupees {{a month on}} movies, though older children also use their money to buy cigarettes, chewing tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. Street children often spend very little on clothing because their employers often provide clothes for work or their families occasionally give them clothes if they <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> living. Also, the boys among them do not mind wandering fully or partially naked in public because it adds to the people's sympathy for them.|$|E

500|$|The {{graphics}} {{were seen}} {{as one of the}} strongest aspects of the game. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot wrote: [...] "graphically, Banjo-Kazooie takes it to another level. The game maintains {{the look and feel of}} Mario 64, but instead of flat, shaded polygons, [...] uses a lot of textures". The game's long draw distance, solid frame rate, special lighting, transparency effects, and animations were also highlighted very positively. Critics also praised the game's dynamic soundtrack. Schneider remarked that it [...] "lets players <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> going. This happens all the time and in every level. It's all very Disney-esque." [...] The sound effects received similar praise, with several editors crediting the unique and diverse speech patterns of the characters.|$|E

When a parent is stationed without their family, the children experience the same emotions as children of divorced parents.

When a military member is sent away, the family does not always <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> going or when (or if) the service member will return. Studies show that there are three phases to deployment, and each phase has different impacts on the family. Military spouses reported the following when their spouse was deployed: ...|$|E
2500|$|Zero Time Dilemma is an {{adventure}} game consisting of multiple chapters, representing 90-minute periods; chapters consist of narrative sections and escape-the-room puzzle sections. The chapters, {{referred to as}} [...] "fragments", are chosen through the Floating Fragment system, in which the player gets to choose a fragment to play based on an image and a vague description. The fragments can be played out of order; the characters lose their memory after each 90-minute period, and do not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in the timeline. When the player completes a fragment, they are returned to the Floating Fragment screen, and the completed fragment is placed in a narrative flowchart, indicating where it {{takes place in the}} story.|$|E

2500|$|Other open {{questions}} of shoaling behaviour include identifying which individuals {{are responsible for}} the direction of shoal movement. In the case of migratory movement, most members of a shoal seem to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> going. Observations on the foraging behaviour of captive golden shiner (a kind of minnow) found they formed shoals which were led by a small number of experienced individuals who knew when and where food was available. If all golden shiners in a shoal have similar knowledge of food availability, there are a few individuals that still emerge as natural leaders (being at the front more often) and behavioural tests suggest they are naturally bolder. [...] Smaller golden shiners appear more willing than larger ones to be near the front of the shoal, perhaps because they are hungrier. Observations on the common roach have shown that food-deprived individuals tend to be at the front of a shoal, where they obtain more food [...] but where they may also be more vulnerable to ambush predators. Individuals that are wary of predation tend to seek more central positions within shoals.|$|E
2500|$|On October 11, the {{day after}} the hijackers had disembarked the ship, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak lied to the media when asked about them saying they had left within hours of coming ashore, [...] "They have {{actually}} left Egypt. I do not know exactly where they have gone. Perhaps they have left for Tunisia." [...] His foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid reiterated the same message [...] "They left Egypt. I <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> but I am not going to tell you." [...] Mubarak would also falsely insist that the hijackers had left Egypt before he had information about Captain De Rosa's correction, [...] "If the captain had told us that a passenger had been killed, we would have changed our position toward the whole operation. But when this [...] emerged, we already had sent the hijackers out of the country." [...] Mubarak also repeated the suggestion that no one had been killed [...] "There is no body and no proof he has been murdered. Maybe the man is hiding or did not board the ship at all." [...] At the time of Mubarak's statements to the news media, the U.S. Administration had already received intelligence information that the hijackers were still in Egypt.|$|E
