5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot is a {{hard rubber}} or plastic cover which <b>fits</b> <b>over</b> {{the base of a}} diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E
5|$|The P90 has {{provisions}} for mounting {{a number of}} different types of accessories, including tactical lights and laser aiming devices. A sling can be attached to the P90 for greater ease of carry, or it can be fitted with various sound suppressors such as the Gemtech SP90, which was designed specifically for the weapon in cooperation with FN Herstal. This stainless steel suppressor with a black oxide finish is built according to MIL-SPECs, including saltwater corrosion resistance. It has a length of 184mm (7.2in), a diameter of 35mm (1.4in) and a weight of 680 g (1.5lb). When subsonic ammunition is used in conjunction with the suppressor, it reduces the sound signature of the P90 by 33dB. A small case collector pouch for the P90 is available which <b>fits</b> <b>over</b> the ejection port and collects spent cases as they are ejected downward; the pouch will collect up to one hundred cases before filling.|$|E
5|$|In most bouts, the retiarius {{probably}} had {{to resort to}} fighting with just his trident and dagger, placing him at a disadvantage. The trident was his primary weapon in such situations, and its length allowed the retiarius to keep his opponent at bay. He held the weapon two-handed, left nearer the prongs, so that he could parry his enemy's strikes with its shaft and strike with both ends. Wielded two-handed, the weapon could land powerful blows. Images show retiarii stabbing downward at the secutors unshielded legs or stabbing down at the helmet in an attempt to poke through an eyehole. The trident itself was too weak to pierce the metal, although a skull found at Ephesus, Turkey, dating to CE200 to 300 shows that a trident strike to the head could be fatal on a bareheaded opponent. The secutors helmet was rounded and free of protrusions to avoid snaring the net or being caught in the trident's prongs, but attacks on it forced the secutor to duck or hide behind his shield. This reduced his field of vision and gave the retiarius an advantage with his speed. Should the secutor strike with his sword, the retiarius parried with the trident prongs and attempted to disarm him. Likewise, the more heavily armoured gladiator tried to block the trident with his shield and force the net-man to lose it. Another type of gladiator, scissor could also be pitted against a retiarius. Images from the Eastern Roman Empire show scissores wearing a tubular arm-guard in lieu of a shield. The guard <b>fits</b> <b>over</b> the left hand and ends in a hooked, knife-like blade that was probably intended to parry the net and trident or to snag and pull away the net. Scissores who succeeded in this probably dropped the hook weapon and fought with just a sword.|$|E

25|$|Another type of drum muffler is a {{piece of}} rubber that <b>fits</b> <b>over</b> the entire drumhead or cymbal. It {{interrupts}} contact between the stick and the head which dampens the sound even more. They are typically used in practice settings.|$|E
25|$|Earmuffs cover a person's ears for thermal protection. Earmuffs {{consist of}} a {{thermoplastic}} or metal head-band, that <b>fits</b> <b>over</b> {{the top of the}} head, and a pad at each end, to cover the external ears. Earmuffs were invented by Chester Greenwood in 1873.|$|E
25|$|The diver {{and tender}} {{on the surface}} are {{connected}} by a rope lifeline and harness. The harness is typically put on over the dry suit but under the BC or other buoyancy device so that the diver remains tethered even {{if he or she}} must remove the air cylinder or buoyancy control device. The harness <b>fits</b> <b>over</b> the shoulders and around the back such that the tender on the surface can, in an emergency, haul an unconscious diver back to the hole. The harness should not be able to slide up or down the diver's torso when pulled in line with the body.|$|E

25|$|The small tent, {{available}} in either red/white or blue/gray stripes, was less popular {{and thus is}} less often seen today. It consists of {{a single piece of}} heavy canvas, with a strip of vinyl along the bottom acting as a reinforcement and splash guard. It <b>fits</b> <b>over</b> the side-door opening (and has a gap for one leg of the roof rack) as a sort of foyer or vestibule. It's big enough for two adults to stand inside, but little else, and was probably intended as a means of getting {{in and out of the}} camper in cold or wet weather.|$|E
25|$|Minifigures {{have also}} {{featured}} unique head sculpts {{that differ from}} the traditional cylindrical shape; the first was Jar Jar Binks, included in a Star Wars set in 1999, followed by Yoda, C-3PO, Harry Potter goblin figures, Kit Fisto, and Plo Koon. Kit Fisto was the first minifigure to not use an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene head. The minifigure used rubber instead. Traditional accessories, such as hats and helmets, cannot be placed on these non-standard heads. Some minifigures, such as Wookiees, Gamorrean Guards and Ewoks use a sandwich board piece which <b>fits</b> <b>over</b> the body. SpongeBob has a sculpted Lego brick head that fits like a standard head, similar to the ghost figures, except that these figures use short or standard legs instead of a brick.|$|E
25|$|A {{primitive}} tourniquet can be {{made from}} a stick and a rope (or leather belt). The rope is made into a loop that <b>fits</b> <b>over</b> the damaged limb and the stick is inserted through the loop. The loop is tightened by twisting the stick. The primitive device may stem the flow of blood but side-effects such as soft tissue damage and nerve damage may occur due to the application of unknown, uncontrollable and excessively high pressures and pressure gradients. It is well established by evidence in the clinical literature that higher tourniquet pressures are associated with higher probabilities of tourniquet-related injuries. Modern pneumatic tourniquet systems are microcomputer-based, allowing more accurate and automatic pressure control and many important safety features to minimize the risk of patient injury. Recent trends toward personalized care has increased patient safety by allowing perioperative staff to measure and select a personalized tourniquet pressure based on the patient’s Limb Occlusion Pressure, and select and apply a personalized tourniquet cuff that can adapt the shape of the tourniquet cuff {{to a wide range of}} non-cylindrical limb shapes.|$|E

25|$|The Xbox 360 Wireless Headset is a {{wireless}} headset {{designed for the}} Xbox 360 and Xbox Live; it is manufactured by Microsoft. It {{can be used for}} in game voice chat, private chat, audio for video chat and in game voice recognition. Up to four wireless headsets can be used simultaneously on a single Xbox 360. The headset <b>fits</b> <b>over</b> either ear and comes with two sizes of removable earloops for a better fit. It uses the same 2.4GHz wireless technology as the Xbox 360 Wireless Controller, so it will work within 30 feet of the console. It can achieve up to eight hours of battery life per charge, with an AC wall adapter or a USB DC charger for recharging. USB chargers are readily available from mobile phone accessory shops. The headset can be used with or without a controller. The headset also produces various beeps to signal different actions and give messages to the user. The headset is also compatible for use with a PC via the Microsoft Wireless Receiver. Up to 4 wireless headsets and wireless controllers can be used in conjunction at any one time. The number lit up on the headset will correspond to the quadrant lit up on the controller..|$|E
500|$|A new [...] "drum skin" [...] that <b>fits</b> <b>over</b> {{the bottom}} half of the DS unit {{provides}} four [...] "pads" [...] for drumming that map to the unit's directional pad and face buttons; this design was selected over use of the touch screen due to the inability of the touch screen to recognize near-simultaneous taps, a factor that would have interfered with the drumming experience. The drum skin is limited to the Nintendo DS Lite due to the skin's form factor. The decision to design towards the DS Lite rather than the newer DSi was due to the much larger volume of DS Lite units that have been sold relative to the DSi.|$|E
500|$|Because of the Magic Wand's popularity, various {{aftermarket}} attachments with {{differences in}} colour, pattern of studs, and material, became available to purchase.

After the metal has cooled and solidified, the mould is removed by breaking it, therefore a new one has to be created for each bell. The process has a high failure rate; only around 50 per cent of castings are successful on the first attempt, without cracks or imperfections.|$|E

2500|$|An ocular prosthesis, {{artificial}} eye or glass eye {{is a type}} of craniofacial prosthesis that replaces an absent natural eye following an enucleation, evisceration, or orbital exenteration. The prosthesis <b>fits</b> <b>over</b> an orbital implant and under the eyelids. [...] Though often referred to as a glass eye, the ocular prosthesis roughly takes the shape of a convex shell and is made of medical grade plastic acrylic. A few ocular prostheses today are made of cryolite glass. A variant of the ocular prosthesis is a very thin hard shell known as a scleral shell which can be worn over a damaged or eviscerated eye. Makers of ocular prosthetics are known as ocularists. An ocular prosthesis does not provide vision; this would be a visual prosthesis. Someone with an ocular prosthesis is totally blind on the affected side and has monocular (one sided) vision.|$|E
