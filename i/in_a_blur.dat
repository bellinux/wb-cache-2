25|$|Because Music has {{the ability}} to access {{multiple}} parts of the brain, music therapy is highly effective in providing therapeutic support for individuals with all types of dementia. Research indicates that the sections of the brain weakened by dementia can be supported and in some cases strengthened by other areas of the brain through musical activities. Musical ability and awareness {{is also one of the}} last functions to be compromised in an individual with dementia, which makes it an especially effective intervention, even in people with very late stage forms of the disease. Music therapy is more than simply listening to or playing music. Through the use of evidence based interventions and clinical assessments, a music therapist works to improve the lives and abilities of individuals. These interventions can decrease anxiety, improve speech and self- expression, and a decrease in negative behaviors and isolation which are commonly found in individuals with dementia. Common negative behaviors that correspond with dementia are depression and agitation. According to Mary S. Mittelman, the director of psychosocial research at Langone Medical Center, music therapy helped to decrease both of these negative substantially. The reason for this is because in the brain, the parts corresponding to music are preserved even through the effects of dementia. Due to these being preserved, residents who live their lives <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blur</b> find some clarity and familiarity through music, creating lower levels of stress and agitation.|$|E
500|$|The album's only cover song, [...] "California Sun", was {{originally}} written by Henry Glover and Morris Levy, and performed by The Rivieras. While the lyrics and musical structure {{remain the same}} throughout the piece, Joey's pronunciation upon words significantly lessened the similarity to the original song. The sound output tone also differs from the original, with more distortion {{as well as a}} faster tempo. Author Steve Waksman relates: [...] "From the opening bars, 'California Sun' becomes subject to the Ramones' distinctive brand of musical minimalism paired with sonic excess. The chords go by <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blur</b> of distortion; the drums and bass kick at seemingly twice the speed of the Rivieras." [...] The twelfth track [...] "Commando" [...] has a theme which deals with war movies and contains multiple military references. Author Avram Mednick said the song was a successor to [...] "Blitzkrieg Bop", released on the band's debut album. He also noted that it has a [...] "bouncy melody and an infectious call-and-response chorus." [...] "You're Gonna Kill that Girl", which was written very early in the band's career, was also rooted in doo-wop genre. Mednick commented that it appealed highly to those tuning into the Ramones in the UK, and also said it has a [...] "lovely misogynistic tune." [...] The final guitar chord on the track is played by drummer Tommy since Johnny rarely played acoustic. The album's final track, [...] "You Should Never Have Opened That Door", was written by Dee Dee and Johnny, and circles themes of horror films and hints that people in these movies tend to be naïve and unintelligent.|$|E

When applied in two dimensions, this formula produces a surface whose s are concentric circles with a Gaussian distribution from the center point. Values from this distribution are used to build a convolution matrix which is applied to the original image. This convolution process is illustrated visually in the figure on the right. Each pixel's new value is set to a weighted average of that pixel's neighborhood. The original pixel's value receives the heaviest weight (having the highest Gaussian value) and neighboring pixels receive smaller weights as their distance to the original pixel increases.

40|$|One of {{the long-standing}} {{challenges}} in photography is motion blur. Blur artifacts are generated from relative motion between {{a camera and}} a scene during exposure. While blur can be reduced by using a shorter exposure, this comes at an unavoidable trade-off with increased noise. Therefore, it is desirable to remove blur computationally. To remove blur, we need to (i) estimate how the image is blurred (i. e. the blur kernel or the point-spread function) and (ii) restore a natural looking image through deconvolution. Blur kernel estimation is challenging because the algorithm needs to distinguish the correct image– blur pair from incorrect ones that can also adequately explain the blurred image. Deconvolution is also difficult because the algorithm needs to restore high frequency image contents attenuated by blur. In this dissertation, we address a few aspects of these challenges. We introduce an insight that <b>a</b> <b>blur</b> kernel can be estimated by analyzing edges <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blurred</b> photograph. Edge profiles <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blurred</b> image encode projections of the blur kernel, from which we can recover the blur using the inverse Radon transform. This method is computationally attractive and is well suited to images with many edges. Blurred edge profiles can also serv...|$|R

We propose a novel algorithm for estimating both the camera rotation axis and the camera angular speed from <b>a</b> single <b>blurred</b> image. The algorithm is based on local analysis of the blur smears. Contrary to the existing methods, we treat the more general case where the rotation axis can be not orthogonal to the image plane, {{taking into account the}} perspective effects that in such case affect the smears. The algorithm is validated in experiments with synthetic and real blurred images, providing accurate estimates. ...|$|R

60|$|Then her {{conscience}} reproached her, and she {{yearned to}} say something kind and loving; but she judged {{that this would be}} construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that. So she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart. Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice of none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then, through a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching one little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and die with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured himself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and his sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how her tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back her boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would lie there cold and white and make no sign--a poor little sufferer, whose griefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke; and his eyes swam <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blur</b> of water, which overflowed when he winked, and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too sacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced in, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit of one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.|$|E
