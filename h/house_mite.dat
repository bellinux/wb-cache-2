40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>House</b> <b>mite,</b> Glycyphagus domesticus (De Geer) {{belongs to}} synanthropic species and pests infesting various stored {{products}} including fruits (e. g. fresh apples, dried plums), bee products and other food-stuffs. Biological investigations {{of this species}} were conducted under controlled laboratory conditions (+ 20 °C, 85 % RH) using bee-bread as mite food. Some {{of the most important}} results obtained are as follows: complete development – 24. 4 days, eclosion of imagines – 74. 5 %, longevity of adults – 55. 7 days, oviposition period – 36. 9 days, fecundity – 190. 4 eggs per female life-span. These data give evidence that the biological potential of G. domesticus is relatively high and bee-bread seems to be an attractive and effective medium ensuring its complete development and favourable population increase. House mites (all stages) often occur on decaying and mouldy products and feed on mycelia of fungi infesting them. In this connection they may play an important part in transmission of diseases and spreading of pathogenic and saprophagous microorganisms causing damage and putrefaction of infested fruits and other food products...|$|E
40|$|Exposure {{to house}} dust has been {{associated}} with asthma in adults, and this is commonly interpreted as a direct immunologic response to dust-mite allergens in those who are IgE sensitized to house dust-mite. Mattress house dust-mite concentrations were measured in a population-based sample of 2890 adults aged between 27 and 56 years living in 22 centers in 10 countries. Generalized linear mixed models were employed to explore the association of respiratory symptoms with house dust-mite concentrations, adjusting for individual and household confounders. There was no overall association of respiratory outcomes with measured house dust-mite concentrations, even in those who reported they had symptoms on exposure to dust and those who had physician-diagnosed asthma. However, there was a positive association of high serum specific IgE levels to HDM (> 3. 5 kUA /l) with mattress house dust-mite concentrations and a negative association of sensitization to cat with increasing house dust-mite concentrations.

40|$|There are {{conflicting}} {{reports on the}} effects of atopy on lung function. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the effects of <b>house</b> <b>mite</b> (HM) atopy on lung function in subsamples of 12 -yearold symptomatic and nonsymptomatic preadolescent children taken from the community sample. An additional objective of this study was to identify possible environmental determinants of HM skin reaction. We obtained questionnaire data on respiratory symptoms and skin-prick tests and performed spirometry on a subsample of 311 children of a birth cohort of children who have been followed over 3 years. Multivariate regression analysis showed progressive decrement of lung function indices (forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec, and forced expiratory flow, midexpiratory phase) with increasing degree of HM atopy reflected by the skin reaction to HM allergens. The apparent association between the level of HM atopy and the lung function indices was highly significant in symptomatic individuals but insignificant in nonsymptomatic subjects. HM sensitization was significantly associated with mother’s atopy. It occurred predominantly in boys and was related to the use of coal or gas for house heating.

40|$|Chitinases are {{enzymes that}} {{catalyze}} the hydrolysis of chitin. Human chitotriosidase (CHIT 1) {{is one of}} the two active human chitinases, involved in the innate immune response and highly expressed in a variety of diseases. CHIT 1 is composed of a catalytic domain linked by a hinge to its chitin binding domain (ChBD). This latter domain belongs to the carbohydrate-binding module family 14 (CBM 14 family) and facilitates binding to chitin. So far, the available crystal structures of the human chitinase CHIT 1 and the Acidic Mammalian Chitinase (AMCase) comprise only their catalytic domain. Here, we report a crystallization strategy combining cross-seeding and micro-seeding cycles which allowed us to obtain the first crystal structure of the full length CHIT 1 (CHIT 1 -FL) at 1. 95 Å resolution. The CHIT 1 chitin binding domain (ChBDCHIT 1) structure shows a distorted β-sandwich 3 D fold, typical of CBM 14 family members. Accordingly, ChBDCHIT 1 presents six conserved cysteine residues forming three disulfide bridges and several exposed aromatic residues that probably are involved in chitin binding, including the highly conserved Trp 465 in a surface- exposed conformation. Furthermore, ChBDCHIT 1 presents a positively charged surface which may be involved in electrostatic interactions. Our data highlight the strong structural conservation of CBM 14 family members and uncover the structural similarity between the human ChBDCHIT 1, tachycitin and <b>house</b> <b>mite</b> dust allergens. Overall, our new CHIT 1 -FL structure, determined with an adapted crystallization approach, {{is one of the}} few complete bi-modular chitinase structures available and reveals the structural features of a human CBM 14 domain...|$|E

Dust mite barrier bedding is relatively inexpensive, convenient to use, and of proven effectiveness in reducing mattress <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> load, but no studies have evaluated its clinical effectiveness in the control of childhood asthma when dispensed in primary care. We therefore aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> barrier bedding in children with asthma treated in primary care.

40|$|<b>House</b> dust <b>mites</b> are a {{group of}} mites that are {{commonly}} found in homes worldwide. The three most commonly found species of <b>house</b> dust <b>mites</b> in temperate environments in the United States are Dermatophagoides farinae, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Euroglyphus maynei. <b>House</b> dust <b>mite</b> allergens are strongly associated with asthma, perennial rhinitis and atopic dermatitis.

40|$|Background: The pathogenetic role of <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> in atopic {{dermatitis}} remains controversial. Recent {{studies have shown}} that intensive epicutaneous contact of <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> allergen with premanipulated skin may induce dematitis. It is, however, uncertain whether such conditions are met during natural contact with <b>house</b> dust <b>mite.</b> In the past, allergen inhalation has been suggested to induce exacerbation of {{atopic dermatitis}}. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether dermatitis could be induced in patients with atopic dermatitis by inhalation of <b>house</b> dust <b>mite.</b> Methods: Twenty patients with atopic dermatitis underwent bronchial provocations with <b>house</b> dust <b>mite.</b> Challenge tests were performed with four concentrations of a standardized <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> extract in a double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled fashion. Spirometry was performed, and FEV, runs measured before and after each challenge dose. Changes in severity or localization of itching or erythema were recorded. Results: In nine of 20 patients with atopic dermatitis bronchial challenge with <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> induced unequivocal skin symptoms after 1. 5 to 17 hours. Pruritic erythematous lesions on noninvolved sites together with exacerbations of existing lesions were seen in three patients. Three patients had an exacerbation only, and three other patients had new lesions only. In eight of nine patients with <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> inhalation-induced dermatitis, skin symptoms were preceded by an early bronchial reaction. All patients with house dust mite-induced dermatitis had a history of asthma, and as a group they had a higher mean blood total IgE la el compared with the ''negative skirt responders. '' One patient had pruritic erythema on the placebo challenge day, without a preceding bronchoconstrictive reaction. The number of patients who had a skin response on the <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> challenge day was significantly higher than the number of patients who had a skin response on the placebo day (p = 0. 011 [Prescott's test]). Conclusions: The respiratory route may be relevant in the induction and exacerbation of dermatitis in a subset of patients with atopic dermatitis who have early bronchial reactions after <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> inhalation, a history of asthma, and an elevated blood total IgE level.

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldBACKGROUND: <b>House</b> dust <b>mites</b> are common sources of indoor allergens. In Reykjavik, Iceland, 9 % of the young adult population had serum-specific IgE to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. Sensitization to mites is usually assumed {{to be due to}} exposure to <b>house</b> dust <b>mites</b> in the indoor environment. This investigation was carried out to measure the concentrations of <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> allergens and to investigate which species of mites were present in beds in Iceland. METHODS: A total of 197 randomly selected adults were visited at home using the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) II Indoor protocol. Dust samples were collected from mattresses for measurement of <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> allergen concentrations and to estimate the number and type of <b>house</b> dust <b>mites.</b> Additional samples from mattresses and floors were collected from the homes of 10 patients with positive skin prick tests (SPT) to D. pteronyssinus. <b>House</b> dust <b>mite</b> allergen concentrations were measured using ELISA and examination of mite species was carried out using microscopy. Climatic parameters were assessed using psychrometer readings in the bedrooms and outdoors. RESULTS: We found two single mite specimens, both D. pteronyssinus, in two dust samples. Mite allergen analyses indicated that two other dust samples had Der f 1 results close to the cut-off of 0. 1 microg/g of dust. No samples were positive for Der p 1. In an additional collection of dust from the homes of 10 SPT-positive patients no Dermatophagoides spp. were found. CONCLUSIONS: Reykjavik citizens are exposed to extremely low amounts of <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> allergens in their homes. Possible alternative sources for sensitization are discussed, such as bird nests, exposure from travelling abroad, or other mites or invertebrates that cross-react with <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> allergens.

The effects of <b>house</b> dust <b>mites</b> on allergy sufferers make <b>house</b> dust <b>mites</b> {{and the study of}} their effects on the human body of great medical and economic importance. A majority of the research that has been done on <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> 2 ̆ 7 s effects on humans has dealt with the lungs and relevant disease like asthma. Little work has been done on the inflammatory response of the skin to the <b>house</b> dust <b>mite.</b> Since the human microvascular dermal endothelial cell(HMVEC-d) is a major regulator in the inflammatory response of the skin, my research attempted to look at the in vitro effects of <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> extract on the expression of inflammatory molecules that are important in inflammatory cell trafficking and activation. HMVEC-d were exposed to extracts of the two most common <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> species Dermatophagoides farinae and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus at four different concentrations. The expression level of the cytokines IL- 1 alpha, IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP- 1 alpha), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and eotaxin, as well as the chemokines IL- 8 and macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP- 1) were analyzed using a sandwich ELISA technique. The expression level of the chemokine receptors CXCR- 1, CXCR- 2, and CCR- 5, and the adhesion molecules intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1), vascular cellular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM- 1), and E-selectin were analyzed using the indirect ELISA technique. Expression of all of the molecules was determined at 12 hours and 24 hours post exposure to <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> extract. The effects of <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> extract on dermal endothelial cells after stimulation with TNF-alpha was also tested. The results showed an extensive upregulation in the expression of several of the molecules that were tested for. The adhesion molecule ICAM- 1 had a significant dose dependent increase in expression but the adhesion molecules VCAM- 1 and E-selectin showed a much smaller yet still significant dose dependent increase in expression. The cytokines and chemokines IL- 6, GM-CSF, IL- 8, and MCP- 1 all showed a significant dose dependent increase in expression by the HMVEC-d. The chemokine receptors were unaffected by the extract and the cytokines IL- 1 alpha, IL- 1 beta, MIP- 1 alpha, and eotaxin were not detected.

The colonisation behaviour of two <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> species in three flooring types was compared and the differences noted. Significant differences were found in the colonisation of the same three flooring types by <b>house</b> dust <b>mites</b> and {{significant differences were found between}} controls and vacuum cleaned flooring. In the home environment, a number of variables were found to influence both the concentration of the <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> allergen Der p I and the level of fungal contamination of carpeted floors. Substantial differences in Der p I allergen concentrations were found between smooth and carpeted flooring and the process of intensive vacuum cleaning showed significant reductions in allergen concentrations for specific cleaning times. Significant differences occurred in airborne allergen concentrations and fungal spore counts both before and after vacuum cleaning, with significant differences found between rooms with carpeted and smooth floors. The general conclusion was that cleaning frequency and flooring type are two of the major variables to control in order to minimise exposure to <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> allergens and fungi in the home...|$|R

40|$|<b>House</b> dust <b>mite</b> {{allergen}} {{exposure is}} a postulated {{risk factor for}} allergic sensitization, asthma development, and asthma morbidity; however, practical and effective methods to mitigate these allergens from low-income, urban home environments remain elusive. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of physical interventions to mitigate <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> allergens in this setting. Homes with high levels of <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> allergen (Der f 1 + Der p 1 > or = 10 microg/g dust by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) in the bed, bedroom carpet, and/or upholstered furniture were enrolled in the study. Carpets and upholstered furniture were subjected to a single treatment of either dry steam cleaning plus vacuuming (carpet only) or intensive vacuuming alone. Bed interventions consisted of complete encasement of the mattress, box spring, and pillows plus either weekly professional or in-home laundering of nonencased bedding. Dust samples were collected at baseline and again at 3 days (carpet and upholstery only) and 2, 4, and 8 weeks posttreatment. We compared pretreatment mean allergen concentrations and loads to posttreatment values and performed between-group analyses after adjusting for differences in the pretreatment means. Both dry steam cleaning plus vacuuming and vacuuming alone resulted in a significant reduction in carpet <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> allergen concentration and load (p < 0. 05). Levels approached pretreatment values by 4 weeks posttreatment in the intensive vacuuming group, whereas steam cleaning plus vacuuming effected a decrease that persisted for up to 8 weeks. Significant decreases in bed <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> allergen concentration and load were obtained in response to encasement and either professional or in-home laundering (p < 0. 001). Between-group analysis revealed significantly less postintervention <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> allergen load in professionally laundered compared to home-laundered beds (p < 0. 05). Intensive vacuuming and dry steam cleaning both caused a significant reduction in allergen concentration and load in upholstered furniture samples (p < 0. 005). Based on these data, we conclude that physical interventions offer practical, effective means of reducing <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> allergen levels in low-income, urban home environments...|$|R
40|$|Twenty {{one adult}} {{patients}} with asthma, with positive skin test {{responses to the}} European <b>house</b> dust <b>mite,</b> Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, were randomly allocated to a control group or to a group applying <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> avoidance measures. These included an initial application of liquid nitrogen to mattresses and bedroom carpets to kill the live <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> population. Histamine airway responsiveness, symptom scores, peak expiratory flow rates (PEF), and <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> numbers were determined during the two week pretrial and eight week trial periods. Nine patients in each group completed the study. By {{the end of the}} study there was a significant reduction in live mites in the "avoidance" group but not in the control group. The avoidance group showed a significant improvement in symptom scores measured on a linear analogue scale, in the number of hours each day spent wheezing (mean reduced from 8. 6 to 4. 5 hours), and in PEF (l/min) both in the morning (from 364 to 388) and in the evening (from 368 to 392). These changes were not found in the control group. The provocative concentration (PC) of histamine causing a 20 % fall in FEV 1 (PC 20 FEV 1) had increased significantly in the avoidance group at eight weeks (from 0. 58 to 2. 3 mg/ml), whereas no change was seen in the control group (from 0. 93 to 1. 21 mg/ml). These results show that <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> avoidance, combined with initial killing of the mite by liquid nitrogen, diminishes airway responsiveness and improves asthma symptom control over an eight week period in adult asthmatic patients with <b>house</b> dust <b>mite</b> allergy...|$|R
