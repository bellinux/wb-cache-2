5|$|Booth was {{regarded}} as an elegant batsman who had an erect stance at the crease. He was known for not hitting the ball hard but for having an easy and relaxed style. In hockey, a player {{is not allowed to}} lift his stick above the shoulders; this background strengthened Booth's forearms and wrists and enabled him to <b>impart</b> <b>momentum</b> on the ball without a large swing of the blade. Booth was particularly known for his late cut and his cover drive, which he played in a manner not dissimilar to Mark Waugh. He was known for his quick footwork against spin bowling and was rarely stumped, and he had the ability to change his batting tempo. Booth quickly got into position and typically moved onto the back foot to cover his stumps. A lean player, Booth stood 181cm, weighed 66kg and refrained from smoking, gambling and drinking. He was known for his efficient outfielding, and {{on the second day of}} the Second Test against the West Indies in Trinidad in 196465, he ran out Gary Sobers and Basil Butcher with strong throws from the outfield. Booth started as a part-time leg spinner before converting to off spin.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{tweezers}} {{are capable}} of manipulating nanometer and micron-sized dielectric particles by exerting extremely small forces via a highly focused laser beam. The beam is typically focused by sending it through a microscope objective. The narrowest point of the focused beam, known as the beam waist, contains a very strong electric field gradient. Dielectric particles are attracted along the gradient to the region of strongest electric field, which {{is the center of}} the beam. The laser light also tends to apply a force on particles in the beam along the direction of beam propagation. This is due to conservation of momentum: photons that are absorbed or scattered by the tiny dielectric particle <b>impart</b> <b>momentum</b> to the dielectric particle. This is known as the scattering force and results in the particle being displaced slightly downstream from the exact position of the beam waist, as seen in the figure.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{underwater}} blast response of free standing sandwich plates with a square honeycomb core and a corrugated core has been measured. The total <b>momentum</b> <b>imparted</b> to the sandwich plate {{and the degree}} of core compaction are measured as a function of (i) core strength, (ii) mass of the front face sheet (that is, the wet face) and (iii) time constant of the blast pulse. Finite element calculations are performed in order to analyse the phases of fluid-structure interaction. The choice of core topology has a strong influence upon the dynamic compressive strength and upon the degree of core compression, but has only a minor effect upon the total <b>momentum</b> <b>imparted</b> to the sandwich. For both topologies, a reduction in the mass of the front (wet) face reduces the <b>imparted</b> <b>momentum,</b> but at the expense of increased core compression. Conversely, an increase in the time constant of the blast pulse results in lower core compression, but the performance advantage over a monolithic plate in terms of <b>imparted</b> <b>momentum</b> is reduced. The sandwich panel results are compared with analytical results for monolithic plates of mass equal to that of (i) the sandwich panel and (ii) the front face alone. (Case (i) represents a rigid core while (ii) represents a core of negligible strength.) For most conditions considered, the sandwich results lie between these limits reflecting the coupled nature of core deformation and fluid-structure interaction...|$|R
50|$|Structural {{behaviour}} {{during an}} explosion depends {{entirely on the}} materials used {{in the construction of}} the building. Upon hitting the face of a building, the shock front from an explosion is instantly reflected. This impact with the structure <b>imparts</b> <b>momentum</b> to exterior components of the building. The associated kinetic energy of the moving components must be absorbed or dissipated in order for them to survive. Generally, this is achieved by converting the kinetic energy of the moving component to strain energy in resisting elements.|$|R

50|$|The {{two main}} types of {{molecular}} pumps are the diffusion pump and the turbomolecular pump.

Diffusion pumps blow out gas molecules with jets of oil or mercury, while turbomolecular pumps use high speed fans to push the gas. Both of these pumps will stall and fail to pump if exhausted directly to atmospheric pressure, so they must be exhausted to a lower grade vacuum created by a mechanical pump.|$|R

50|$|The {{rest of the}} bullet's {{kinetic energy}} is spent in the {{deformation}} or shattering of the bullet (depending on bullet construction), damage to the target (depending on target construction), and heat dissipation. In other words, because the bullet strike on the target is an inelastic collision, {{only a minority of}} the bullet energy is used to actually <b>impart</b> <b>momentum</b> to the target. This is why a ballistic pendulum relies on conservation of bullet momentum and pendulum energy rather than conservation of bullet energy to determine bullet velocity; a bullet fired into a hanging block of wood or other material will spend much of its kinetic energy to create a hole in the wood and dissipate heat as friction as it slows to a stop.|$|E
50|$|Traditional breastshot waterwheels {{consist of}} a series of flat blades fixed to the rim of a wheel.

5000|$|In {{the second}} half of the two-part season four premiere, [...] "Charmed Again (Part 2)", Paige {{displays}} her method of moving objects with her mind by orbing objects from one location to another through a vocal command.

The rods are sufficiently soft (ductile) {{to allow the}} expansion without breaking the rods or the welded joints, and the detonation velocity is limited to under 1,150 m/s, allowing the rods to bend at these locations instead. At some intermediate point the ring will have a zig-zag (alternating direction) appearance within a cylindrical envelope. Upon ultimate expansion the ring is circular and contained within a plane. The ring will then break and ultimately tend to form one or more straight rods. Since the net momentum of the rod relative to the missile is roughly zero its effectiveness will rapidly diminish as the broken ring expands.|$|R
