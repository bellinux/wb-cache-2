5|$|Heathenry, also termed Heathenism or Germanic Neopaganism, is {{a modern}} Pagan religion. Scholars of {{religious}} studies classify Heathenry as a new religious movement. Its practitioners model their <b>faith</b> <b>on</b> the pre-Christian belief systems adhered to by the Germanic peoples of Iron Age and Early Medieval Europe. To reconstruct these past belief systems, Heathenry uses surviving historical, archaeological, and folkloric evidence as a basis, although approaches to this material vary considerably.|$|E
5|$|Justice Phang {{also held}} that section 5(3) of the Land Acquisition Act was not {{necessarily}} determinative of the matter in the Collector's favour, as acquisitions can be challenged for having been made in bad faith.

5|$|Since the {{adoption}} of the article of <b>faith</b> <b>on</b> the baptism of the Holy Spirit in 1908, the Pentecostal Holiness Church has taught the following beliefs as their five cardinal doctrines: justification by faith, entire sanctification, the baptism in the Holy Spirit evidenced by speaking in tongues, Christ's atonement (including divine healing), and the premillennial second coming of Christ.|$|E

5|$|Hermano Pule {{immediately}} sent {{a letter}} to Archbishop José Seguí in Manila rebuking the acts of the Tayabas friars, and accusing them of beatings and threatening the excommunication of cofradía members. He also challenged the friars' authority to do such acts because the aims of the cofradía were never against the Catholic <b>faith.</b> <b>On</b> January 29, 1841, Pule {{sent a letter}} to the Bishop of Nueva Cáceres restating that the cofradía was not against canon law. The letter was forwarded to the juez provisor of the bishopric, who then endorsed it to Fr. Antonio Mateo and Fr. Manuel Sancho, who rejected Pule's petition.|$|E
5|$|The author {{starts with}} Basavanna's birth and weaves episodes of other famous sharanas (devotees of Hindu god Shiva)—such as Allama Prabhu—into his life history. Basavanna is {{depicted}} as a saintly person, a great devotee of Shiva, an incarnation of Nandi, a man of miracles and one with a mission, sent to re-establish the Veerashaiva <b>faith</b> <b>on</b> earth. The work is arranged into eight aswasas (divisions) containing sixty-one sandhis (chapters) and 3,621 verses. The narration includes stories of devotees of Shiva who overcame their egos. Apart from a few variations, the writings of Bhima Kavi and his predecessors are complementary. Two lost works of Bhima Kavi are the Bhimakaviswara Ragale and the Bhringidandaka.|$|E
5|$|As {{the year}} progressed, Calvin and Farel's {{reputation}} with the council began to suffer. The council {{was reluctant to}} enforce the subscription requirement, as only a few citizens had subscribed to their confession of <b>faith.</b> <b>On</b> 26 November, the two ministers hotly debated the council over the issue. Furthermore, France was taking an interest in forming an alliance with Geneva and as the two ministers were Frenchmen, councillors had begun to question their loyalty. Finally, a major ecclesiastical-political quarrel developed when the city of Bern, Geneva's ally in the reformation of the Swiss churches, proposed to introduce uniformity in the church ceremonies. One proposal required the use of unleavened bread for the Eucharist. The two ministers were unwilling to follow Bern's lead and delayed {{the use of such}} bread until a synod in Zurich could be convened to make the final decision. The council ordered Calvin and Farel to use unleavened bread for the Easter Eucharist. In protest, they refused to administer communion during the Easter service. This caused a riot during the service and the next day, the council told Farel and Calvin to leave Geneva.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Faith {{reached the}} northernmost {{latitude}} {{and had the}} longest track of any Atlantic tropical cyclone. The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1966 Atlantic hurricane season, Faith developed from an area of disturbed weather between Cape Verde and {{the west coast of}} Africa on August21. Tracking westward, the depression gradually intensified and became Tropical Storm <b>Faith</b> <b>on</b> the following day. Moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean, it continued to slowly strengthen, reaching hurricane status early on August23. About 42hours later, Faith reached an initial peak with winds of 105mph (165km/h), before weakening slightly on August26. Located near the Lesser Antilles, the outer bands of Faith produced gale force winds in the region, especially Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Antigua. Minor coastal damage occurred as far south as Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E

5|$|Little {{information}} was revealed about Armada of the Damned plot. Sterling had {{no connection with}} the film series' characters and story arcs. The game and the films shared the same universe, but the former was to take place before {{the events of the}} latter. Sterling, raised in a poor family, was a young adventurer with dreams of fame and fortune who decided to become a pirate. Although he was killed on his first voyage, Sterling was revived by supernatural forces which gave him a second chance. After these events, the player had the option to follow two paths: become either a Legendary or a Dreaded pirate. On the Legendary path, the player would be a well-respected pirate who acted in good <b>faith.</b> <b>On</b> the Dreaded path, the player would be mysterious and feared.|$|E

5|$|Two {{bishops and}} a hermit came to Vladimir, {{gave him a}} wooden cross, and {{confirmed}} that the tsar had made a pledge of <b>faith</b> <b>on</b> it. Vladimir kissed the cross and clutched it to his chest, collected a few followers, and set off for Prespa. As he arrived, on 22May 1016, he went into a church to pray. When he exited the church, he was struck down by Vladislav's soldiers and beheaded. According to Skylitzes, Vladimir believed Vladislav's pledge, told {{to him by the}} Bulgarian archbishop David. He then allowed himself to fall into Vladislav's hands, and was executed. The motivation behind the murder is unclear. Since Samuel's defeat in 1014, the Bulgarians had been losing battle after battle, and Vladislav probably suspected or was informed that Vladimir planned to restore Duklja's alliance with Byzantium. This alliance would be particularly disturbing for Tsar Vladislav because of the proximity of Duklja to Dyrrhachium, which was a target of the tsar's war efforts.|$|E
