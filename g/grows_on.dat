5|$|In the Margaret River region, Banksia ilicifolia {{has been}} {{confused}} with Banksia sessilis var. cordata as both have prickly foliage and domed flowerheads. However, the former <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> deep sand {{while the latter}} <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> grey sand over limestone ridges. The embedded follicles of B. ilicifolia compared with the loose ones of B. sessilis are another distinguishing feature.|$|E

50|$|S. acidocaldarius is a facultative autotroph. When growing autotrophically this {{organism}} oxidises sulfur to sulfate, while fixating carbon from carbon dioxide. The {{doubling time}} of cultures <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> sulfur alone falls between 36.8-55.3h. This species can also <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> complex organic substrates. When <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> 0.1% yeast extract the growth is faster, and the doubling times are between 6.5 and 8h.|$|R
5|$|The fungus is saprobic, and <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> the ground, in leaf litter, or on decomposing wood. It {{has been}} {{collected}} in Spain, South Carolina, Florida, and Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|The lichen {{typically}} <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> silicate stone, rarely on decaying wood. It {{is usually}} in partial shade in openings in low to mid-elevation moist forests, {{and is also}} frequently found in rocky roadcuts. Lichens with cephalodia are capable of fixing nitrogen, and contribute nitrogen to the ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|The organisms which parasitize fungi {{are known}} as mycoparasitic organisms. Certain species of the Pythium genus, which are oomycetes, have {{potential}} as biocontrol agents against certain fungi. Fungi can also act as mycoparasites or antagonists of other fungi, such as Hypomyces chrysospermus, which <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> bolete mushrooms.|$|E
5000|$|Psilocybe cyanescens <b>grows</b> today {{primarily}} <b>on</b> wood chips, {{especially in}} {{and along the}} perimeter of mulched plant beds in urban areas, but can also <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> other lignin-rich substrates. P. cyanescens does not <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> substrate that is not lignin-rich. Fruitings {{have been reported in}} natural settings previously (although most appear to be migrations from mulched plant beds.) [...] The species does not typically <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> mulch that is made from bark.|$|R
5000|$|Crustose lichens grow {{flat against}} the surface that the colonies are <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> (substrate), {{typically}} rocks or wood. The plant grows tightly appressed to the substrate, and {{is very close to}} the substrates at all points, forming a biological layer. There is overlap between crustose lichens <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> rock with those <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> wood, as well as with lichens listed in other sections of this article.|$|R
50|$|Epizoic {{organisms are}} those that live non-parasitically {{on the surface of}} animals. Examples of epizoic species include mosses, algae, and fungi <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> Gymnopholus weevils, and bryozoans (moss animals) <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> other animals.|$|R

5|$|Another {{mushroom}} that <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> decomposing fruit bodies is Asterophora lycoperdoides, {{which is}} distinct from C.cookei because of the powdery brown asexual spores (chlamydospores) produced on the cap surface. Alexander H. Smith has noted a general similarity in appearance between C.cookei and the North American species Clitocybe sclerotoidea (then known as Tricholoma sclerotoideum), which is parasitic to Helvella lacunosa. However, C.sclerotoidea is larger than C.cookei, with cap diameters up to , and has more distantly spaced gills.|$|E
5|$|B.sessilis var. cordata was {{published}} as Dryandra floribunda var. cordata by Carl Meissner in 1848. In 1870, George Bentham published D.floribunda var. major, {{but this is}} now considered a taxonomic synonym of B.sessilis var. cordata. It has larger inflorescences than var. sessilis, as well as larger dark green rather than blue green leaves. It {{is found in the}} state's far southwest, between Capes Leeuwin and Naturaliste, and east to Walpole, and <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> sandy soils over limestone.|$|E
50|$|Examples of lithophytes {{include several}} Paphiopedilum orchids, ferns, many algae and liverworts. Species that only <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> rock or gravel are obligate lithophytes. Species that <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> rocky {{substrate}} and elsewhere are facultative lithophytes.|$|R
40|$|Summary To {{investigate}} morphological acclimation {{to differences}} in nutrient availability, we compared shoot and needle morphology of Picea glehnii (Friedr. Schmidt) M. T. Mast. and Picea jezoensis (Siebold & Zucc.) Carrière trees <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> nutrient-poor volcanic ash and nutrient-rich, brown forest soil. Trees of both species were shorter and had more open canopies when <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> volcanic ash than when <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> brown forest soil. Nutrient-poor conditions limited height growth less in P. glehnii than in P. jezoensis. In both species, trees <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> volcanic ash had shorter annual in-crements {{in the previous year}} and more needles per shoot length and, hence, a smaller shoot silhouette area (SSA) rela-tive to needle dry mass (NDM) than trees <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> brown forest soil. Soil type had less effect on shoot projected needle area (PNA). Total needle area (TNA) of P. glehnii shoots wa...|$|R
50|$|Commensalism {{is similar}} to facilitation, in that one plant is mostly {{exploiting}} another. A familiar example is the ephiphytes which <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> branches of tropical trees, or even mosses which <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> trees in deciduous forests.|$|R
5|$|Banksia epica is a shrub that <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> {{the south}} coast of Western Australia. A {{spreading}} bush with wedge-shaped serrated leaves and large creamy-yellow flower spikes, it grows up to 3½metres (11½ft) high. It is known only from two isolated {{populations in the}} remote south east of the state, near {{the western edge of}} the Great Australian Bight. Both populations occur among coastal heath on cliff-top dunes of siliceous sand.|$|E
5|$|Bovista pila, {{commonly}} known as the tumbling puffball, is a species of puffball fungus in the family Agaricaceae. A temperate species, it is widely distributed in North America, where it <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> the ground on road sides, in pastures, grassy areas, and open woods. There are few well-documented occurrences of B.pila outside North America. B.pila closely resembles the European B.nigrescens, from which it can be reliably distinguished only by microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Coccomyces dentatus is a {{saprobic}} species, and <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> {{dead leaves}} {{of a wide}} variety of angiosperms. It is frequently encountered on members of the heather (family Ericaceae), and the beech family (Fagaceae), such as oak (red, white, and live oak) and chestnut, and also on the exotic Castanea sativa from Chile. Other common substrates include leaves of trees in the genera Rhododendron, Lithocarpus, Berberis, Arbutus, Gaultheria, and Myrica.|$|E
5000|$|Drynaria roosii is an epiphytic (<b>growing</b> <b>on</b> trees) or epipetric (<b>growing</b> <b>on</b> rocks) plant. Like {{other species}} of Drynaria, they possess two frond types [...] - [...] a fertile foliage frond and a sterile nest frond.|$|R
500|$|A {{microhabitat}} is the small-scale {{physical requirements}} of a particular organism or population. Every habitat includes large numbers of microhabitats with subtly different exposure to light, humidity, temperature, air movement, and other factors. The lichens that <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> the north face of a boulder are different to those that <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> the south face, from those on the level top [...] and those that <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> the ground nearby; the lichens growing in the grooves and on the raised surfaces {{are different from those}} <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> the veins of quartz. Lurking among these miniature [...] "forests" [...] are the microfauna, each species of invertebrate with its own specific habitat requirements.|$|R
50|$|Larvae live in silken tubes among Homalothecium lutescens <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> {{the ground}} or on low rocks, or among Bryum species <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> walls. The larvae have a dull purplish or reddish brown body and blackish brown head.|$|R
