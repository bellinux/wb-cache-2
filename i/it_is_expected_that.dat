5|$|Research in 1996 {{revealed}} that Sakurai's Object possessed {{the characteristics of}} a R Coronae Borealis variable star with the anomaly of Carbon-13 (13C) deficit. Also, the metallicity of Sakurai's object in 1996 was similar to that of V605 Aquilae in 1921. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> Sakurai's object will grow in its metallicity to match that of V605 Aquilae.|$|E
5|$|Another {{model for}} the {{formation}} of Type Ia supernovae involves the merger of two white dwarf stars, with the combined mass momentarily exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit. There is much variation in this type of event, and in many cases there may be no supernova at all, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> they will have a broader and less luminous light curve than the more normal SN Type Ia.|$|E

5|$|Darmstadtium is {{the eighth}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since copernicium (element 112) {{has been shown to}} be a transition metal, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with darmstadtium as part of the platinum group metals and a noble metal. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue platinum, thus implying that darmstadtium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 10 elements, nickel, palladium, and platinum.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, Chengdu {{has also}} {{attracted}} many other major global corporations, including Citigroup, HSBC, Standard Chartered Bank, ABN AMRO, BNP Paribas, JPMorgan Chase and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ {{in the banking}} sector. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> by 2012, value-added financial services will make up 14% of the added-value service industry and 7% of the regional GDP. By 2015, those figures are expected to grow to 18% and 9% respectively.|$|E
5|$|In {{international}} {{public opinion}} surveys {{there is strong}} support {{for a variety of}} methods for addressing the problem of energy supply. These methods include promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power, requiring utilities to use more renewable energy, and providing tax incentives to encourage the development and use of such technologies. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> renewable energy investments will pay off economically in the long term.|$|E

5|$|Instead of {{generating}} {{a set of}} woven source code, some AspectJ weavers instead weave the aspects and classes together directly into bytecode, acting both as the aspect weaver and compiler. While <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> the performance of aspect weavers which also perform the compilation process will require more computation time due to the weaving process involved. However, the bytecode weaving process produces more efficient runtime code than would usually be achieved through compiled woven source.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> reopening {{the station}} {{will result in}} reduced car usage to and from Pill and the {{surrounding}} villages. Most station users will walk to the station, with the next largest share being car drivers and car passengers being dropped off, followed by cyclists and bus users. Some parking restrictions are proposed to prevent rail users parking on the local streets, which are narrow and not suitable for widening.|$|E
5|$|Meitnerium is {{the seventh}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals.

5|$|No {{compounds}} of oganesson {{have been}} synthesized yet, but calculations on theoretical compounds {{have been performed}} since 1964. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> if the ionization energy of the element is high enough, {{it will be difficult}} to oxidize and therefore, the most common oxidation state would be 0 (as for other noble gases); nevertheless, this appears not to be the case.|$|E
5|$|Partnership for Peace (PfP) {{membership}} {{was offered}} to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia. NATO hoped {{that this would}} bring these countries more into the Euro-Atlantic community as the PfP is a programme of practical bilateral cooperation between individual Partner countries and NATO, thereby allowing Partner countries {{to choose their own}} priorities for cooperation. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> PfP membership is for these three countries the first step towards NATO membership. As a result, the PfP offer sparked the anger of the UN tribunal trying suspected war criminals from the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Researchers are {{investigating}} the clinical significance of c-KIT mutations in AML. These are prevalent, and potentially clinically relevant because {{of the availability of}} tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and sunitinib that can block the activity of c-KIT pharmacologically. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> additional markers (e.g., RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53) that have consistently been associated with an inferior outcome will soon be included in these recommendations. The prognostic importance of other mutated genes (e.g., DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2) is less clear.|$|E

Only about 170 of 3,400 total employees moved into the new tower on the first day. Future tenants will include Kids Creative, Legends Hospitality, the BMB Group, Servcorp, and GQ.|$|E
5|$|Tourism is {{the most}} {{significant}} contributor to Kalimpong's economy. The summer and spring seasons are the most popular with tourists, keeping many of town's residents employed directly and indirectly. The town—earlier an important trade post between India and Tibet—hopes to boost its economy after the reopening of the Nathu La (pass) in April 2006. Though this has resumed Indo–China border trades, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> Kalimpong will {{have a better chance of}} revival as a hub for Indo–China trades if the demand of local leaders for reopening of Jelep La pass also is met.|$|E

5|$|About 90 {{atoms of}} flerovium have been observed: 58 were {{synthesized}} directly, {{and the rest}} were made from the radioactive decay of heavier elements. All of these flerovium atoms {{have been shown to}} have mass numbers from 284 to 290. The most stable known flerovium isotope, flerovium-289, has a half-life of around 2.6seconds, but {{it is possible that the}} unconfirmed flerovium-290 with one extra neutron may have a nuclear isomer with a longer half-life of 19seconds; this would be one of the longest half-lives of any isotope of any element at these farthest reaches of the periodic table. Flerovium is predicted to be near the centre of the theorized island of stability, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> heavier flerovium isotopes, especially the possibly doubly magic flerovium-298, may have even longer half-lives.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{two million}} {{visitors}} arrived in Amman in 2014, {{which made it}} the 93rd most visited {{city in the world}} and the 5th most visited Arab city. Amman has a relatively fast growing economy, and it is ranked Beta− on the global city index. Moreover, it was named one of the Middle East and North Africa's best cities according to economic, labor, environmental, and socio-cultural factors. The city is among the most popular locations in the Arab world for multinational corporations to set up their regional offices, alongside Doha and only behind Dubai. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> in the next 10 years these three cities will capture the largest share of multinational corporation activity in the region.|$|E
5|$|Clouds {{typically}} cover 1% of Titan's disk, though outburst {{events have}} been observed in which the cloud cover rapidly expands {{to as much as}} 8%. One hypothesis asserts that the southern clouds are formed when heightened levels of sunlight during the southern summer generate uplift in the atmosphere, resulting in convection. This explanation is {{complicated by the fact that}} cloud formation has been observed not only after the southern summer solstice but also during mid-spring. Increased methane humidity at the south pole possibly contributes to the rapid increases in cloud size. It was summer in Titan's southern hemisphere until 2010, when Saturn's orbit, which governs Titan's motion, moved Titan's northern hemisphere into the sunlight. When the seasons switch, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>that</b> ethane will begin to condense over the south pole.|$|E
