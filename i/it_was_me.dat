That was that! He and the other officials kept their eyes on us after that and we had little chance of getting away with any more larks like that.|$|E

I {{went through a lot}} of personal turmoil right around the time Audioslave formed and unfortunately I think that affected the band a little bit in terms of me not really being grounded.... I think there was stuff that could have been resolved, and there was drama that was probably unnecessary, typical rock band stuff. I certainly played a role in it. I definitely feel like I was part of a lot of unnecessary stuff. It didn't need to become what it became. You learn with experience." ...|$|E

[...] He commented on the production: [...] "Well, in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now. In fact, I don't use reverb at all. I can't stand it... You know, it's hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how you would want it now." ...|$|E

I remember looking down the shore, after I {{had been there for}} five or six hours, and I saw two smiling faces, in the form of Gemma Whelan and Alfie Allen. They were just smiling their asses off, because they weren't cold! They just had to run to the boat." [...] In regards to stunts, Asbæk continued, [...] "I {{got a little bit of}} help, but not much. I think 95 percent of <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>me.</b> I like to do all of it when I can, because then I can feel it with the character." ...|$|E
500|$|Rae {{recorded}} most of The Sea in 2009 at Manchester's Limefield Studios. She co-produced {{the record}} mostly with Steve Brown and Steve Chrisanthou, {{both of whom}} had worked on her debut album. Rae pursued a sound more aggressive than on her debut. During the recording process, Rae listened to the 1973 Sly & the Family Stone record Fresh and Curtis Mayfield's There's No Place Like America Today (1975), {{as well as the}} music of Nina Simone and Leonard Cohen. A live band was used in the album's recording, which was also a departure from her debut. [...] "On the first album, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>me</b> and a producer in a basement going though hundreds of snare drum sounds to find the right one", she recalled. [...] "With a live band, you can stretch out more and try new things out without feeling you're having to undo this meticulously built-up track".|$|E
500|$|Lennon grew {{concerned}} that fans who attended Beatles concerts {{were unable to}} hear the music above the screaming of fans, and that the band's musicianship was beginning to suffer as a result. Lennon's [...] "Help!" [...] expressed his own feelings in 1965: [...] "I meant it... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>me</b> singing 'help'". He had put on weight (he would later refer to this as his [...] "Fat Elvis" [...] period), and felt he was subconsciously seeking change. In March that year he was unknowingly introduced to LSD when a dentist, hosting a dinner party attended by Lennon, Harrison and their wives, spiked the guests' coffee with the drug. When they wanted to leave, their host revealed what they had taken, and strongly advised them not {{to leave the house}} because of the likely effects. Later, in an elevator at a nightclub, they all believed it was on fire: [...] "We were all screaming... hot and hysterical." ...|$|E

He said that the murder had {{happened}} in Southampton the previous year and [...] "that he was particularly troubled because this was around the anniversary of her death". He repeated the confession to a prison officer the following day, and subsequently wrote a note which stated: [...] "After much deliberation and thought and confession with the priest here in Wandsworth, after all the trouble I have caused, not only to you, the police, but myself, the mental torture I have gone through, the family of the person concerned, I must for my own sanity and the punishment I will receive for this horrible crime, I wish now that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>me</b> that was dead and not the person I killed at the Tom Tackle pub. ...

500|$|With a {{shooting}} budget of $700,000, Saw began principal photography on [...] at Lacy Street Production Facility in Los Angeles for 18 days. The bathroom {{was the only}} set {{that had to be}} built. Danny Glover completed his scenes in two days. Due to the tight shooting schedule, Wan could not afford to shoot {{more than a couple of}} takes per actor. [...] "It was a really tough struggle for me. Every day, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>me</b> fighting to get the shots I did not get. I had high aspirations, but there's only so much you can do. I wanted to make it in a very Hitchcockian style of filmmaking, but that style of filmmaking takes time to set up and so on," [...] Wan said about the very short shooting schedule. He said the style instead ended up being [...] "more gritty and rough around the edges due to the lack of time and money that we had to shoot the movie with" [...] and it ultimately became the aesthetic of the film.|$|E

The 1960s and the early 1970s were {{the glory days of}} forward and four-time Belgian Golden Shoe Paul Van Himst, later elected Belgian UEFA Golden Player of 1954–2003 and Belgium's Player of the Century by IFFHS. At the 1965 Ballon d'Or, Van Himst ranked fourth, achieving Belgium's highest ever position at the European football election. Decades after Coppens and Van Himst had retired from playing football, a journalist on a Flemish television show asked them [...] "Who [...] was the best, actually?". Coppens replied: [...] "I will ask Paul that... If Paul says <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>me,</b> then he's right". In 1966, striker Raoul Lambert and defending midfielder Wilfried Van Moer joined the national team; while the UEFA praised Lambert for his skills at Euro 1972, Van Moer won three Golden Shoes and equalled Van Himst's fourth rank at the Ballon d'Or in 1980.|$|E

500|$|... "Beautiful People" [...] is an uptempo electro house, dancehall and Europop {{song with}} R influences. According to James Dean Wells from AOL Radio, {{the song is}} [...] " [...] pulsing synths that build under Benassi and Brown's staccato and auto-tuned melodies." [...] "Beautiful People" [...] is set in common time with a {{moderate}} tempo of 126 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of Eb major with Brown's vocal range spanning from the note of Eb4 to the note of F5. The song is positive and uplifting with lyrics such as: [...] "Everywhere that I've been / The only thing that I see is beautiful people ... / Don't you know / Don't you know / You're beautiful." [...] According to Rap-Up, on the song, Brown encourages [...] "everyone {{on the dance floor}} to keep their heads up and discover the beauty inside." [...] When speaking about [...] "Beautiful People", Brown told Jayson Rodriguez from MTV News that [...] "it wasn't a selfish record, it wasn't me bragging or boasting or talking about cars or money or girls. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>me</b> being able to inspire people with dance music. We have a lot of tragic things going on and the world needs to come together as a whole and stop the negativity." ...|$|E
500|$|The Guitar Trio {{continued}} touring in 1980. De Lucía reportedly {{suffered from}} headaches and backaches while performing because {{he found it}} difficult to improvise and follow McLaughlin and Coryell's advanced knowledge of jazz improvisation. Paco professed, [...] "Some people assume that they were learning from me, but I can tell you <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>me</b> learning from them. I have never studied music, I am incapable of studying harmony—I don't have the discipline, playing with McLaughlin and Di Meola was about learning these things." [...] In 1981, Coryell was replaced with Di Meola, and The Guitar Trio released one of their most successful records, Friday Night in San Francisco, which sold over 1 million copies and generated a significant interest in flamenco music in America and Europe. It featured an extended combination of Mediterranean Sundance and Río Ancho; this became arguably the piece most associated with the musicians. De Lucía also formed the Paco de Lucía Sextet in 1981 (which included his brothers Ramón and Pepe), and released the first of its three albums that same year. On 30 August 1981, de Lucía performed a solo set at St. Goarshausen in Germany, where he performed Monasterio de Sal and Montino among others and later performed with The Guitar Trio. The event was broadcast on national WDR television.|$|E

Hermione punches Draco when he mocks Hagrid for crying over Buckbeak's death sentence.

Either way, that's below the level of trash TV, trash journalism." [...] After quitting his White House position, Clarke became a prominent critic of the Bush administration's war on terrorism. Hitchens contends that the film does not mention Clarke's remarks so that it can criticize Bush for not going after Bin Laden's family, while holding up Clarke as a heroic, anti-war figure.|$|E
