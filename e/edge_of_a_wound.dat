Cell {{spreading}} {{and migration}} {{associated with the}} expression of the 92 -kD gelatinase (matrix metalloproteinase 9 or MMP- 9) are important mechanisms involved in the repair of the respiratory epithelium. We investigated the location of MMP- 9 and its potential role in migrating human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC). In vivo and in vitro, MMP- 9 accumulated in migrating HBEC located at the leading <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wound</b> and MMP- 9 expression paralleled cell migration speed. MMP- 9 accumulated through an actin-dependent pathway in the advancing lamellipodia of migrating cells and was subsequently found active in the extracellular matrix (ECM).

40|$|A serum {{factor that}} {{promotes}} migration of (mouse) 3 T 3 fibroblast cells {{is shown to}} be distinct from the growth-promoting and cell-survival factors of serum. The factor promotes migration of cells from the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wound</b> in confluent 3 T 3 cells, but cell migration under these conditions {{does not lead to}} the initiation of DNA synthesis. Subsequent addition of serum initiates DNA synthesis in the migrating cells. The results establish that breaking contacts between quiescent 3 T 3 cells is not sufficient to initiate DNA synthesis. The DNA synthesis observed in migrating 3 T 3 cells in the typical “woundhealing” experiment presumably results because the migrating cells have an increased ability to use serum factors.

These observations suggest that MMP- 9 controls the migration of repairing HBEC by remodeling the provisional ECM implicated in primordial contacts. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that a finely tuned protease-anti-protease equilibrium must be maintained during processes of cell migration in order to limit extracellular proteolysis to the close proximity of the cell surface, and thereby to prevent excessive extracellular matrix degradation. We have previously shown that urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) activity is induced in microvascular endothelial cells migrating from the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wounded</b> monolayer in vitro (Pepper et al., J. Cell Biol., 105 : 2535 - 2541, 1987). By Northern analysis, we now demonstrate that plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI- 1) mRNA is increased in multiple-wounded monolayers of bovine microvascular (BME) or aortic (BAE) endothelial cells, with a maximal 7 - and 9 -fold increase 4 h after wounding, respectively. By in situ hybridization, we demonstrate {{that the increase in}} PAI- 1 mRNA is localized to cells at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wounded</b> BME or BAE cell monolayer. The increase in PAI- 1 mRNA observed in BME cells is independent of cell division and is inhibited by antibodies to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), suggesting that PAI- 1 induction in migrating cells is mediated by the autocrine activity of bFGF. Taken together with our previous observations on the induction of u-PA, these results support the hypothesis that the proteolytic balance in the pericellular environment of migrating cells is regulated through the concomitant production of proteases and protease inhibitors...|$|R

40|$|We are {{concerned}} with the mechanisms involved in the directed migration of eukaryotic cells. Previously we found that, inside cells at the edge of an experimental wound, the Golgi apparatus and the microtubule-organizing center were rapidly repositioned forward of the nucleus in the direction of subsequent cell migration into the wound. This repositioning was proposed to serve the purpose of introducing new membrane mass at {{the leading edge of the}} cell, by directing Golgi apparatus-derived vesicles bound for the plasma membrane to that edge. We now provide evidence to support this proposal. Cultured fibroblastic cells at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wound</b> were infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant (0 - 45) of vesicular stomatitis virus. It is known that the G-protein, an integral membrane protein of the virus, is synthesized and remains in the rough endoplasmic reticulum at the nonpermissive temperature, but when the infected cells are shifted to the permissive temperature, the G-protein moves through the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. By immunofluorescence microscopy, we here show that the first appearance of the G-protein at the cell surface corresponds to the leading edge of the motile cell. These observations are incorporated into a coherent scheme for the mechanisms involved in cell migration...|$|E
40|$|Lamin A/C {{is a major}} {{constituent}} of the nuclear lamina, a thin filamentous protein layer that lies beneath the nuclear envelope. Here we show that lamin A/C deficiency in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Lmna−/− MEFs) diminishes the ability of these cells to polarize at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wound</b> and significantly reduces cell migration speed into the wound. Moreover, lamin A/C deficiency induces significant separation of the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) from the nuclear envelope. Investigations using ballistic intracellular nanorheology reveal that lamin A/C deficiency also dramatically affects the micromechanical properties of the cytoplasm. Both the elasticity (stretchiness) and the viscosity (propensity of a material to flow) of the cytoplasm in Lmna−/− MEFs are significantly reduced. Disassembly of either the actin filament or microtubule networks in Lmna+/+ MEFs results in decrease of cytoplasmic elasticity and viscosity down to levels found in Lmna−/− MEFs. Together these results show that both the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton and cytoskeleton-based processes, including cell motility, coupled MTOC and nucleus dynamics, and cell polarization, depend critically on {{the integrity of the}} nuclear lamina, which suggest the existence of a functional mechanical connection between the nucleus and the cytoskeleton. These results also suggest that cell polarization during cell migration requires tight mechanical coupling between MTOC and nucleus, which is mediated by lamin A/C...|$|E

An analogue of myosin II that was covalently cross-linked in the 10 S conformation and unable to assemble served {{as an indicator of}} the cytoplasmic volume accessible to 10 S myosin II. Ratio-imaging of an analogue that can undergo 10 S [...] > 6 S conversion versus the volume indicator revealed localized concentration of assembly-competent myosin II. In stationary serum-deprived cells and in cells locomoting at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wound,</b> it was most concentrated in the peripheral cytoplasm, where fibers containing myosin II assemble, and least concentrated in the perinuclear cytoplasm, where they disassemble. Furthermore, fluorescence photobleaching recovery showed myosin II to be less mobile in the periphery than in perinuclear cytoplasm. These results indicate a gradient in the assembly of myosin II. Three-dimensional microscopy of living cells revealed that fibers containing myosin II were localized in the cortical cytoplasm, whereas myosin II was diffusely distributed in the deeper cytoplasm, suggesting that myosin II is assembled preferentially near the cell surface. Localized protein phosphorylation may play a role, because a kinase inhibitor, staurosporine, abolished the gradient of myosin II assembly...|$|E

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of tissue integrity {{is essential for}} the life of multicellular organisms. Healing of a skin wound is a paradigm for how various cell types localize and repair tissue perturbations in an orchestrated fashion. To investigate biophysical mechanisms associated with wound localization, we focus on a model system consisting of a fibroblast monolayer on an elastic substrate. We find that the creation of an edge in the monolayer causes cytosolic calcium oscillations throughout the monolayer. The oscillation frequency increases with cell density, which shows that wound-induced calcium oscillations occur collectively. Inhibition of myosin II reduces the number of oscillating cells, demonstrating a coupling between actomyosin activity and calcium response. The spatial distribution of oscillating cells depends on the stiffness of the substrate. For soft substrates with a Young's modulus E ~ 360 Pa, oscillations occur on average within 0. 2 [*]mm distance from the wound edge. Increasing substrate stiffness leads to an average localization of oscillations away from the edge (up to ~ 0. 6 [*]mm). In addition, we use traction force microscopy to determine stresses between cells and substrate. We find that an increase of substrate rigidity leads to a higher traction magnitude. For E[*][*] [*][*]~ 8 kPa, traction magnitude is on average almost uniform beneath the monolayer. Thus, the spatial occurrence of calcium oscillations correlates with the cell–substrate traction. Overall, the experiments with fibroblasts demonstrate a collective, chemomechanical localization mechanism at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wound</b> with a potential physiological role...|$|E

The physiologic migration of endothelial {{cells from the}} <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>wound</b> and the pathophysiologic migration of medial smooth muscle cells into the intima are two important components of the vessel wall's response to injury. The influence of the angiotensin system on endothelial and smooth muscle cell migration have not been examined. In the present study, the influence of angiotensin system components on bovine aortic endothelial cell (BAEC) and bovine aortic smooth muscle cell (BASMC) migration after release of cultured cell monolayers from contact inhibition was determined. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril increased BAEC migration 41 % +/- 3 % (P less than 0. 001), as did the specific angiotensin II antagonist sar 1, ile 8 -angiotensin II (SAR) (41 % +/- 3 % (P less than 0. 001). Exogenous angiotensin I and angiotensin II did not affect BAEC migration. Exogenous angiotensin II abolished the effect of lisinopril on BAEC migration. Lisinopril increased cell-associated u-plasminogen activator (u-PA) 23 % +/- 3 % (P less than 0. 001) in migrating BAEC and angiotensin II abolished this increase. SAR increased u-PA 33 % +/- 0 % (P less than 0. 001). In contrast, these agents had the opposite effect on smooth muscle cells. Angiotensin II increased smooth muscle cell migration 40 % +/- 3 % (P less than 0. 001), and this effect was abolished by SAR. Angiotensin II also increased cell-associated u-PA 83 % +/- 7 % (P less than 0. 001) in migrating BASMC. The increase in BAEC migration with inhibition of endothelial cell angiotensin II stimulation, either with lisinopril or SAR, also was associated {{with an increase in}} cell-associated u-PA. These results indicate that lisinopril interrupts an autocrine pathway in endothelial cells, in which endothelial cell-derived angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II by ACE, and imply that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in vivo would act to reduce vessel wall injury by directly increasing the rate of endothelial cell wound closure; by increasing the antithrombotic tendency of the endothelium via enhanced u-PA; and indirectly, by decreasing production of angiotensin II and thereby the rate of smooth muscle cell migration into the intima...|$|R

The initial cellular response is alignment <b>of</b> the <b>edge</b> with <b>an</b> accompanying formation <b>of</b> tangential marginal actin bundles within individual cells positioned along the wound edge. Later, coherent out-growths of cell masses occur by the formation of special “leader” cells at the tops of outgrowths and “follower” cells along the sides. Leader cells exhibit profound cytoskeletal reorganization, including disassembly of marginal bundles, the realignment of actin filament bundles, and penetration of microtubules into highly active lamellae. Additionally, cell–cell contacts acquire radial geometry indicative of increased contractile tension. Interestingly, leader cells acquire a cytoskeletal organization and motility typical of fibroblasts.

Immunoblot analysis <b>of</b> <b>wounded</b> monolayers demonstrated <b>a</b> novel RHAMM protein isoform that appeared within one hour after injury. At the time of increased cell motility after wounding, FACS analysis demonstrated {{an increase in the}} membrane localization in approximately 25 % of the cell population. Confocal microscopy of injured monolayers confirmed that membrane expression of this receptor was limited to cells at the wound edge. Collectively, these data demonstrate that RHAMM is necessary for the migration of smooth muscle cells and that expression and distribution of this receptor is tightly regulated following wounding of BASMC monolayers...|$|R
40|$|Leader {{cells are}} a {{fundamental}} biological process that {{have only been}} investigated since the early 2000 s. These cells have often been observed emerging at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> artificial <b>wound</b> in 2 D epithelial cell collective invasion, created with either a mechanical scrape from a pipette tip or from the removal <b>of</b> <b>a</b> plastic, physical blocker. During migration, the moving cells maintain cell-cell contacts, <b>an</b> important quality <b>of</b> collective migration; the leader cells originate from either the first or the second row, they increase in size compared to other cells, and they establish ruffled lamellipodia. Recent studies in 3 D have also shown that cells emerging from an invading collective group that also exhibit leader-like properties. Exactly how leader cells influence and interact with follower cells {{as well as other}} cells types during collective migration, however, is another matter, and is <b>a</b> subject <b>of</b> intense investigation between many different labs and researchers. The majority of leader cell research to date has involved epithelial cells, but as collective migration is implicated in many different pathogenic diseases, such as cancer and <b>wound</b> healing, <b>a</b> better understanding <b>of</b> leader cells in many cell types and environments will allow significant improvement to therapies and treatments for <b>a</b> wide variety <b>of</b> disease processes. In fact, more recent studies on collective migration and invasion have broadened the field to include other cell types, including mesenchymal cancer cells and fibroblasts. However, the proper technology for picking out dynamic, single cells within a moving and changing cell population over time has severely limited previous investigation into leader cell formation and influence over other cells. In line with these previous studies, we not only bring new technology capable of dynamically monitoring leader cell formation, but we propose that leader cell behavior is more than just an epithelial process, and that it is a critical physiological process in multiple cell types and diseases...|$|R
40|$|Locomoting {{cells are}} {{characterized}} by a pronounced external and internal anterior-posterior polarity. One of the events associated with cell polarization at the onset <b>of</b> locomotion is <b>a</b> shift <b>of</b> the centrosome, or MTOC, ahead of the nucleus. This position {{is believed to be}} of strategic importance for directional cell movement and cell polarity. We have used BSC- 1 cells at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> in vitro <b>wound</b> to clarify the causal relationship between MTOC position and the initiation of cell polarization. We find that pronounced cell polarization (the extension <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lamellipod) can take place in the absence of MTOC repositioning or microtubules. Conversely, MTOCs will reposition even after lamellar extension and cell polarization have occurred. Repositioning requires microtubules that extend to the cell periphery and is independent of selective detyrosination of microtubules extending towards the cell front. Significantly, MTOCs maintain, or at least attempt to maintain, a position at the cell's centroid. This is most clearly demonstrated in wounded monolayers of enucleated cells where the MTOC closely follows the centroid position. We suggest that the primary response to the would is the biased extension <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lamellipod, which can occur in the absence of microtubules and MTOC repositioning. Lamellipod extension leads to <b>a</b> shift <b>of</b> the cell's centroid towards the wound. The MTOC, in an attempt to maintain a position near the cell center, will follow. This will automatically put the MTOC ahead of the nucleus {{in the vast majority of}} cells. The nucleus as a reference for MTOC position may not be as meaningful as previously thought...|$|R
40|$|Separate {{populations of}} microtubules (MTs) {{distinguishable}} by {{their level of}} posttranslationally modified tubulin subunits and by their stability in vivo have been described. In polarized 3 T 3 cells at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> in vitro <b>wound,</b> we have found a striking preferential coalignment of vimentin intermediate filaments (IFs) with detyrosinated MTs (Glu MTs) rather than with {{the bulk of the}} MTs, which were tyrosinated MTs (Tyr MTs). Vimentin IFs were not stabilizing the Glu MTs since collapse of the IF network to a perinuclear location, induced by microinjection of monoclonal anti-IF antibody, had no noticeable effect on the array of Glu MTs. To test whether Glu MTs may affect the organization of IFs we regrew MTs in cells that had been treated with nocodazole to depolymerize all the MTs and to collapse IFs; the reextension of IFs into the lamella lagged behind the rapid regrowth of Tyr MTs, but was correlated with the slower reformation of Glu MTs. Similar realignment of IFs with newly formed Glu MTs was observed in serum-starved cells treated with either serum or taxol to induce the formation of Glu MTs. Next, we microinjected affinity purified antibodies specific for Glu tubulin (polyclonal SG and monoclonal 4 B 8) and specific for Tyr tubulin (polyclonal W 2 and monoclonal YL 1 / 2) into 3 T 3 cells. Both injected SG and 4 B 8 antibodies labeled the subset of endogenous Glu MTs; W 2 and YL 1 / 2 antibodies labeled virtually all of the cytoplasmic MTs. Injection of SG or 4 B 8 resulted in the collapse <b>of</b> IFs to <b>a</b> perinuclear region. This collapse was comparable to that observed after complete MT depolymerization by nocodazole. Injection of W 2, YL 1 / 2, or nonspecific control IgGs did not result in collapse of the IFs. Taken together, these results show that Glu MTs localize IFs in migrating 3 T 3 fibroblasts and suggest that detyrosination of tubulin acts as a signal for the recruitment of vimentin IFs to MTs...|$|R
