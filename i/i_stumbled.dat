Forrest claimed Bannon and {{her books}} [...] "are {{in a class}} by themselves" [...] and credits Bannon with saving her life, writing in 2005, [...] "Overwhelming need led me to walk a {{gauntlet}} of fear up to the cash register. Fear so intense that I remember nothing more, only that <b>I</b> <b>stumbled</b> out of the store in possession of what I knew I must have, a book as necessary to me as air... I found it when I was eighteen years old. It opened the door to my soul and told me who I was." ...|$|E
500|$|Responding to {{an article}} in The Nation by Alexander Cockburn, Dershowitz also cited The Chicago Manual of Style:Cockburn's claim {{is that some of}} the quotes should not have been cited to their {{original}} sources but rather to a secondary source, where he believes <b>I</b> <b>stumbled</b> upon them. Even if he were correct that I found all these quotations in Peters's book, the preferred method of citation is to the original source, as The Chicago Manual of Style emphasizes: [...] "With all reuse of others' materials, it is important to identify the original as the source. This...helps avoid any accusation of plagiarism ... To cite a source from a secondary source ('quoted in...') is generally to be discouraged...." ...to which Cockburn responded:Quoting The Chicago Manual of Style, Dershowitz artfully implies that he followed the rules by citing [...] "the original" [...] as opposed to the secondary source, Peters. He misrepresents Chicago here, where [...] "the original" [...] means merely the origin of the borrowed material, which is, in this instance, Peters.Now look at the second bit of the quote from Chicago, chastely separated from the preceding sentence by a demure three-point ellipsis. As my associate Kate Levin has discovered, this passage ("To cite a source from a secondary source...") occurs on page 727, which is no less than 590 pages later than the material before the ellipsis, in a section titled [...] "Citations Taken from Secondary Sources." [...] Here's the full quote, with what Dershowitz left out set in bold: [...] "'Quoted in'. To cite a source from a secondary source ("quoted in") is generally to be discouraged, since authors are expected to have examined the works they cite. If an original source is unavailable, however, both the original and the secondary source must be listed."So Chicago is clearly insisting that unless Dershowitz went to the originals, he was obliged to cite Peters. Finkelstein has conclusively demonstrated that he didn't go to the originals. Plagiarism, QED, plus added time for willful distortion of the language of Chicago's guidelines, cobbling together two separate discussions. On behalf of Dershowitz, Harvard Law School dean Elena Kagan asked former Harvard president Derek Bok to investigate the assertion of plagiarism; Bok exonerated Dershowitz of the charge. In an April 3, 2007 interview with the Harvard Crimson, [...] "Dershowitz confirmed that he had sent a letter last September to DePaul faculty members lobbying against Finkelstein's tenure." ...|$|E

[...] The other conspirators, including Hou, were sentenced to death. [...] Emperor Taizong initially considered commuting Hou's death sentence because of his accomplishments, but the other officials opposed, and Emperor Taizong stated to Hou, [...] "I have to bid you, Duke, farewell. [...] From now, I can only see your portrait!" [...] Both he and Hou wept. [...] As Hou was about to be beheaded, he stated to the general overseeing the execution, [...] "I, Hou Junji, am not the type to commit treason, but <b>I</b> <b>stumbled</b> many times and reached this point. [...] But as I destroyed two kingdoms as a general, please speak for me to His Imperial Majesty to request that I could have a son remaining to carry on the lineage, on the basis of my accomplishments." [...] Emperor Taizong, when he heard this, pardoned Hou's wife and children but exiled them to the modern Guangdong region, and confiscated his properties.|$|E
