Therefore, {{this paper presents}} the analyses of various popular 1 -bit <b>digital</b> <b>summing</b> circuits in light of PVT (process, voltage and temperature) variations to verify their functionality and robustness. The investigation is carried with ± 3 ó process parameters and ± 10 % V DD (supply voltage) variation by applying Gaussian distribution and Monte Carlo analysis at 22 nm technology node on HSPICE environment. Design guidelines are derived to select the most suitable topology for the design features required.

Hence, a TG-based <b>digital</b> <b>summing</b> circuit is implemented using carbon nanotube field effect transistor (CNFET).
