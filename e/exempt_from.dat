5|$|Communities with {{demonstrated}} {{loyalty to}} Rome retained their own laws, could collect their own taxes locally, and in exceptional cases were <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> Roman taxation. Legal privileges and relative independence were {{an incentive to}} remain in good standing with Rome. Roman government was thus limited, but efficient in its use of the resources available to it.|$|E

5|$|Following the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision, Manual became racially {{integrated}} without {{controversy and}} graduated {{its first two}} black students in 1958. Starting in the 1960s, Manual began to face problems associated with inner city schools in the United States as economically advantaged families moved towards Louisville's suburbs. Manual was <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> court-ordered busing in the 1970s because its racial makeup already met federal guidelines.|$|E
5|$|Married {{with two}} young children, Speirs would have been <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> conscription, but he volunteered to join the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders in 1915. He was {{promoted}} to lance corporal, corporal and sergeant, and won the Military Medal for bravery in the field, but was killed during the Battle of Passchendaele in August 1917, {{at the age of}} 31.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland was not invaded during {{either of}} the world wars. During World War I, Switzerland was home to Vladimir Illych Ulyanov (Vladimir Lenin) and he {{remained}} there until 1917. Swiss neutrality was seriously questioned by the Grimm–Hoffmann Affair in 1917, but it was short-lived. In 1920, Switzerland joined the League of Nations, which was based in Geneva, on condition that it was <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> any military requirements.|$|E

5|$|The Roman Catholic Church was {{the largest}} {{landowner}} {{in the country and}} enjoyed special exemptions in property acquisition, and land owned by the Roman Catholic Church was <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> land reform. The white and gold Vatican flag was regularly flown at all major public events in South Vietnam, and Diệm dedicated his country to the Virgin Mary in 1959.|$|E
5|$|To {{strengthen}} the city's firefighting capabilities, the city established a reserve unit called the Exempt Fireman's Company, so called {{because it was}} made up of firemen who were <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> militia and jury duty. The company was led by veteran fireman Zophar Mills, who had helped stop the great 1835 fire from crossing Wall Street.|$|E
5|$|As he lies dying {{under the}} abbey's rubble, Zerchi is startled to {{encounter}} Mrs Grales/Rachel, a bicephalous tomato peddler and mutant. However, Mrs. Grales has been rendered unconscious by the explosion, {{and may be}} dying herself. As Zerchi tries to conditionally baptize Rachel, she refuses, and instead takes the ciborium and administers the Eucharist to him. It is implied that she is, like the Virgin Mary, Eve and Jesus, <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> original sin, and may even be the Second Coming of Christ to begin a new cycle on Earth. Zerchi soon dies, having witnessed an apparent miracle.|$|E

5|$|By far {{the largest}} single cost was the {{purchase}} of the ship Terra Nova, for £12,500. Terra Nova had been in Antarctica before, as part of the second Discovery relief operation. Scott wanted to sail her as a Naval vessel under the White Ensign; to enable this, he obtained membership of the Royal Yacht Squadron for the sum of £100. He was thus able to impose Naval discipline on the expedition, and as a registered yacht of the Squadron, Terra Nova became <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> Board of Trade regulations which might otherwise have deemed her unfit to sail.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{kept the}} control of the nation firmly within the hands of his {{brothers}} and their in-laws, and promotions in the ARVN were given on the basis of religion and loyalty rather than merit. Two unsuccessful attempts had been made to depose Diệm; in 1960, a paratroop revolt was quashed after Diệm stalled negotiations to buy time for loyalists to put down the coup attempt, while a 1962 palace bombing by two air force pilots failed to kill him. South Vietnam's Buddhist majority had long been discontented with Diệm's strong favoritism towards Catholics. Public servants and army officers had long been promoted on the basis of religious preference, and government contracts, US economic assistance, business favors and tax concessions were preferentially given to Catholics. The Roman Catholic Church was the largest landowner in the country, and its holdings were <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> land reform. In the countryside, Catholics were de facto <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> performing corvée labour. Discontent with Diệm and Nhu exploded into mass protest during the summer of 1963 when nine Buddhists died at the hand of Diệm's army and police on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the various departments and agencies under gubernatorial control, the Governor has an executive administrative staff that assist in coordinating the executive duties. This staff is led by a Chief of Staff, and includes five offices: Intergovernmental Relations, Legal Counsel, Legislative and Policy, Press, and the Governor's Office in Washington, D.C.. The Chief of Staff {{has a number of}} deputies to assist in running these departments. The Governor's staff is appointed and therefore largely <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> state civil service laws.|$|E

5|$|In the 12th century, the Quanzhen School {{was founded}} in Shandong. It flourished during the 13th and 14th century and during the Yuan dynasty became {{the largest and most}} {{important}} Taoist school in Northern China. The school's most revered master, Qiu Chuji, met with Genghis Khan in 1222 and was successful in influencing the Khan towards exerting more restraint during his brutal conquests. By the Khan's decree, the school also was <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> taxation.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Force were <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> {{service as}} a peace officer or parish officer, {{and could not be}} {{compelled}} to serve on a jury; field officers could not be required to serve as a high sheriff.

Accepting a commission as an officer of the Force did not vacate the seat of a Member of Parliament.|$|E
