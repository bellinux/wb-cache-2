5|$|Most {{teachers}} {{are required to}} address HIV/AIDS in their curricula; although <b>instructors</b> <b>are,</b> for the most part, committed to helping their students understand and avoid the disease, they face many obstacles that prevent them from informing their students about HIV/AIDS in productive ways. For example, some teachers cannot advise their students to remain faithful to their sexual partners without seeming hypocritical because they engage in extramarital sexual relations themselves. Others feel uncomfortable discussing sexual matters with their students, and some believe that, due to their limited training, they are not knowledgeable enough about HIV/AIDS to direct classroom discussions about the disease. In addition, many teachers feel unsupported by community members, who often either deny {{the extent of the}} epidemic or believe that HIV/AIDS should not be addressed in the classroom.|$|E

25|$|In the ROC, before May 26, 1995, {{military}} training lessons were mandatory {{to all students}} of senior high schools, colleges and universities. As a result, there were and still are many military instructors stationed at every school more advanced than senior high schools. Naturally these military <b>instructors</b> <b>are</b> also commissioned officers in active duty either dispatched from or trained by the branch of Political Warfare. Before 1995, one of their missions at school is to closely watch, report, or even suppress any possible anti-government or political activity launched by students on or off campus.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{training}} for open water certification {{for a person}} who is medically fit to dive and a reasonably competent swimmer is relatively short. The minimum number of open-water dives required for certification is usually four, but <b>instructors</b> <b>are</b> generally required by training standards to ensure that the diver is sufficiently skilled before certification is issued, and this may require further training and experience beyond the required minimum. Many dive shops in popular holiday locations offer courses intended to teach a novice to dive in a few days, which can be combined with diving on the vacation. Other instructors and dive schools will provide more thorough training, which generally takes longer.|$|E

25|$|The {{prison service}} (Kli'a) sectors guards Israeli {{military}} prisons. It {{is divided into}} two: the service responsible for guarding prisons and detention centers with Israeli prisoners, and the service responsible for guarding the two detention centers containing Palestinian detainees, Shomron and Etzion. When the military police controlled the major detainment prisons, Megiddo, Ofer and Ktzi'ot, {{each of the two}} sub-sectors has a unique training course. As of 2007 however, all jailors undergo the jail instructors' course. The actual jailors, or jail <b>instructors,</b> <b>are</b> considered IDF commanders for all intents and purposes, although as of August 2007, are no longer distinguished by the green aiguilette worn by most commanders and instructors in the IDF. Instead, a new red and blue aiguillette was made for them, different in design than that of the law enforcement sector.|$|E
25|$|When {{determining}} if {{an outcome}} has been achieved, assessments may become too mechanical, looking {{only to see}} if the student has acquired the knowledge. The ability to use and apply the knowledge in different ways may not be the focus of the assessment. The focus on determining if the outcome has been achieved leads to a loss of understanding and learning for students, who may never be shown how to use the knowledge they have gained. <b>Instructors</b> <b>are</b> faced with a challenge: they must learn to manage an environment that can become fundamentally different from what they are accustomed to. In regards to giving assessments, they must be willing to put in the time required to create a valid, reliable assessment that ideally would allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the information, while remaining objective.|$|E
25|$|In this classification, skiers with {{cerebral}} palsy have difficulty walking in ski boots and sometimes require assistance when walking in them. When going up hill, they often have their weaker side on the uphill side. In learning to ski, a ski bra {{is often used to}} teach the proper technique. Skiers sometimes have difficulty with the snowplough technique. In teaching skiers with {{cerebral palsy}}, <b>instructors</b> <b>are</b> encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encourage as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement. Some skiers {{with cerebral palsy}} have better balance while using skis than they would otherwise. This presents challenges for coaches who are working with the skier. Compared to other skiers in the class, the skier with cerebral palsy may tie more quickly.|$|E

25|$|In {{teaching}} skiers with cerebral palsy, <b>instructors</b> <b>are</b> {{encouraged to}} delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encouraged as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement. One method of learning to ski for competitors with cerebral palsy in this classification is the American Teaching System. They first thing skiers learn is what their equipment is, and {{how to put it}} on and take it off. Next, skiers learn about positioning their body in a standing position on flat terrain. After this, the skier learns how to side step, and then how to fall down and get back up again. The skier then learns how to do a straight run, and then is taught how to get on and off the chair lift. This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers, wedge turns, wide track parallel turns, how to use ski poles, and advanced parallel turns.|$|E
