25|$|By {{the twelfth}} and early thirteenth centuries, {{there was a}} shift away from the accusatorial model toward the legal {{procedure}} used in the Roman Empire. Instead of an individual making accusations based on first-hand knowledge, judges now took on the prosecutorial role based on information collected. Under inquisitorial procedures, guilt or innocence was proved by the inquiry (inquisitio) of the judge <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> a case.|$|E
25|$|A further {{breakthrough}} occurred {{upon the}} advent of modern ("ab initio") electronic structure calculations whereby the relevant parameters characterising JT systems can be reliably determined from first principles. Thus one could go beyond studies of model systems that explore the effect of parameter variations on the PES and vibronic energy levels; one could also go on beyond fitting these parameters to experimental data without clear knowledge {{about the significance of}} the fit. Instead, well-founded theoretical investigations became possible which greatly improved the insight into the phenomena at hand and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the underlying mechanisms.|$|E

The only audience given by the Pope while in Washington was with a former student of his, an openly gay Argentine named Yayo Grassi and Grassi's same-sex partner of 19 years. Observers speculated whether the Pope had not been informed of Davis' controversy or if the Vatican had underestimated the media impact that such a meeting would cause.|$|E

2500|$|The {{deficiencies}} {{with equipment}} {{led to an}} overall lack of mobility, which coupled with the limited training of the units meant that very few were capable of organised offensive counter-attacks against an invading force.

2500|$|On October 2, the PKI {{newspaper}} Harian Rakjat {{published an}} editorial {{that would eventually}} be used {{as evidence that the}} Communists had organized the coup attempt by Untung and his group. Anderson and McVey noted that the Harian Rakjat [...] "prided itself on well written and cogently argued editorials", but the editorial in question [...] "is no gem of style or clarity". They believed that the [...] "foolish hesitant editorial" [...] provided the Army an opportunity to place the blame of the coup on the PKI. Since the coup, Anderson and McVey noted that the Army's success in blaming the PKI was [...] "both because of actual PKI involvement, however confused, and because all groups now in power wish to believe it, since for years they lived in growing fear of a possible PKI takeover". To conclude their observations of the events of and following the coup, Anderson and McVey asserted, [...] "It is not the place here to go <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the anti-Communist campaign which developed {{in the wake of the}} Army coup of October 1." [...] However, they believed that the coup itself and subsequent events formed [...] "quite separate political phenomena" [...] despite being [...] "intimately related". Anderson and McVey believed this to be the case because of a three-week absence of violence that ended on October 21, when Communist youth elements clashed with the Army Para-Commando Regiment ( [...] , abbreviated as RPKAD) in Boyolali Regency.|$|E
2500|$|The {{politics}} of neuromarketing is {{this idea of}} using advertisements to convince {{the mind of a}} voter to vote for a certain party. This has already been happening within the elections throughout the years. In the 2006 reelection of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, he was double digits off in the voting in comparison to his Democratic opponent. However, Schwarzenegger's theme in this campaign was whether or not the voters would want to continue Schwarzenegger's reforms or go {{back to the days of}} the recalled governor, Gray Davis. In normal marketing, voters would use [...] "detail, numbers, facts and figures to prove we were better off under the new governor". However, with neuromarketing, voters followed powerful advertisement visuals and used these visuals to convince themselves that Schwarzenegger was the better candidate. Now, with political neuromarketing, there exists a lot of controversy. The ethics behind political neuromarketing are debatable. Some argue that political neuromarketing will cause voters to make rash decisions while others argue that these messages are beneficial because they depict what the politicians can do. However, control over political decisions could make voters not see the reality of things. Voters may not look <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> the reforms, personality, and morality each person brings to their political campaign and may be swayed by how powerful the advertisements seem to be. However, there are also people that may disagree with this idea. Darryl Howard, [...] "a consultant to two Republican winners on November 2, says he crafted neuromarketing-based messages for TV, direct mail and speeches for Senate, Congressional and Gubernatorial clients in 2010". He says that these advertisements that were presented, show honesty and continues to say how he and other politicians decide which advertisements are the most effective.|$|E
