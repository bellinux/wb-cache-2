5|$|Weeding rakes: As weeding was a {{constant}} issue in the ancient and medieval Chinese agricultural process, {{it led to the}} invention of the weeding rake. The invention of the Chinese weed rake is derived from the invention of the Chinese harrow. In the Chinese agricultural text Qimin Yaoshu written by the Northern Wei Dynasty official Jia Sixie. <b>Harrows</b> were originally called iron-teeth rakes due to its shaping. According to it's shape, the Chinese harrow was divided into three sub-classifications: Strip rake, Y-shaped rake, and square rake. The <b>harrows</b> seen in the murals of the Wei and Jin Dynasties are strip rakes.|$|E

Besides tractors, these include ploughs, <b>harrows,</b> drills, transplanters, cultivators, irrigation equipment, and harvesters. New techniques are changing the cultivation procedures involved in growing vegetables with computer monitoring systems, GPS locators, and self-steer programs for driverless machines giving economic benefits.|$|E

Seven <b>Harrows</b> were destroyed by a low level attack by Luftwaffe fighters of JG 26 and JG 54 on Evere airfield as part of Operation Bodenplatte, the German attack on Allied airfields in northwest Europe on 1 January 1945, leaving only five <b>Harrows,</b> which were eventually retired on 25 May 1945.|$|E

25|$|The Harrow {{also served}} in a novel {{operational}} role {{at the height of}} the German night Blitz against Britain in the winter of 1940–1941. Six <b>Harrows</b> equipped No. 420 Flight RAF (later No. 93 Squadron RAF) which used lone <b>Harrows</b> to tow Long Aerial Mines (LAM) into the path of enemy bombers. The LAM had an explosive charge on the end of a long cable and the unorthodox tactic was credited with the destruction of 4–6 German bombers. The experiment was judged of poor value and the planned deployment of Douglas Havocs in the LAM role was cancelled. Nine <b>Harrows</b> were also used by 782 Naval Air Squadron, Fleet Air Arm as transports. After flight refuelling trials, three <b>Harrows</b> were operated by Flight Refuelling Limited and refuelled Short Empire Flying Boats on transatlantic services, two from Gander, Newfoundland and one based in Foynes, Ireland. In 1940, the two aircraft based at Gander were impressed into service with the Royal Canadian Air Force.|$|E

As he couldn't afford new agricultural implements for his machine, he was forced to innovate, welding together two <b>harrows</b> designed for use by horses and similarly trying to adapt other horse-drawn gear for use in mechanized agriculture.|$|E

25|$|In 1934, Cobham {{had founded}} Flight Refuelling Ltd and by 1938 had used FRL's looped-hose system to refuel {{aircraft}} {{as large as}} the Short Empire flying boat Cambria from an Armstrong Whitworth AW.23. Handley Page <b>Harrows</b> were used in the 1939 trials to perform aerial refueling of the Empire flying boats for regular transatlantic crossings. From August 5 to October 1, 1939, sixteen crossings of the Atlantic were made by Empire flying boats, with fifteen crossings using FRL's aerial refueling system. After the sixteen crossings further trials were suspended due to the outbreak of World War II.|$|E
25|$|Early farming {{equipment}} {{relied heavily}} on horses. Labour on the farm could not be performed by farmers alone; cultivation technologies were not sophisticated, so devices such as <b>harrows,</b> carriages and harvest racks were the standard. Steam-powered farming machinery {{began to appear in}} southern Saskatchewan in the 1920s, which created much public attention for farmers using the machines. Despite fascination with the new technologies, the machinery disappeared from Saskatchewan farms during the 1930s; the machines were not economically viable amid the Great Depression. This resulted in a renaissance for horses, and early farming technology returned to regular use. It wasn’t until the 1940s that farming machinery would see a resurgence amid a flourishing post-World War II economy. The average fee for farming equipment was $40,000-$50,000. Ever since that time, farm machinery has been evolving technologically and quickly climbing in price. Today, the necessary farm machines cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. This high price creates great difficulty for new farmers wishing to enter the industry.|$|E
25|$|Secrecy was an {{essential}} part, {{as it had}} been at the Battle of Beersheba the preceding year. It was feared that the Ottomans could thwart the preparations for the attack by making a withdrawal in the coastal sector. Laborious efforts were therefore made to prevent the Ottomans discerning Allenby's intentions and to persuade them that the next Entente attack would be made in the Jordan Valley. All westward movements of personnel and vehicles from the Jordan Valley towards the Mediterranean coast were made during the night while all movements eastwards were made during daytime. The detached Anzac Mounted Division in the Jordan Valley simulated the activity of the entire mounted corps. Troops marched openly down to the valley by day, and were secretly taken back by lorry at night to repeat the process the next day. Vehicles or mules dragged <b>harrows</b> along tracks to raise dust clouds, simulating other troop movements. Dummy camps and horse lines were constructed and a hotel in Jerusalem was ostentatiously commandeered for an Expeditionary Force headquarters.|$|E

2500|$|The first Harrow was {{delivered}} to No. 214 Squadron RAF on 13 January 1937, with all 100 delivered {{by the end of}} the year, with five bomber squadrons of the RAF being equipped with the Harrow. The Fleet Air Arm ordered 100 <b>Harrows</b> but Handley Page lacked the production capacity to supply them. Despite being fitted with cabin heating by steam boilers using exhaust heat, the Harrow gained a reputation of being a cold and draughty aircraft, owing to the turret design. As the delivery of more modern bombers increased, the Harrow was phased out as a frontline bomber by the end of 1939 but continued to be used as a transport. 271 Squadron was formed on 1 May 1940 with a mixture of <b>Harrows,</b> Bristol Bombays and impressed civil aircraft. While the other aircraft equipping 271 Squadron were replaced by Douglas Dakotas, it retained a flight of <b>Harrows</b> (sometimes nicknamed [...] "Sparrows" [...] due to their new nose fairings to give a more streamlined fuselage) as transports and ambulance aircraft until the end of the Second World War in Europe.|$|E

2500|$|Ploughing is {{not always}} {{regarded}} as essential nowadays, but the plough can improve soil by inverting it to improve soil aeration and drainage, release nutrients through weathering, and expose harmful pests to predators. [...] It is also an effective method of weed control. [...] Ploughing depth in Britain varies between 5–6inches in some limestone regions to up to 18inches in deep stoneless silt land. [...] Most British ploughs are designed to turn a furrow of up to about a foot deep, which is relatively shallow compared to some other countries, where furrows of up to 16inches are common. [...] Other machines used to prepare land include cultivators (to break up land too heavy for a normal plough), <b>harrows</b> (to level the surface of ploughed land), rolls or rollers (used for firming the soil), sprayers and dusters (used to spread herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and fertilisers).|$|E
