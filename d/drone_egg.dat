50|$|All colonies {{are totally}} {{dependent}} on their queen, who is the only egg-layer. However, even the best queens live {{only a few years}} and one or two years longevity is the norm. She can choose whether or not to fertilize an egg as she lays it; if she does so, it develops into a female worker bee; if she lays an unfertilized egg it becomes a male drone. She decides which type of egg to lay {{depending on the size of}} the open brood cell she encounters on the comb. In a small worker cell, she lays a fertilized egg; if she finds a larger drone cell, she lays an unfertilized <b>drone</b> <b>egg.</b>|$|E
40|$|Social insect colonies {{invest in}} {{reproduction}} and growth, but how colonies achieve an adaptive allocation to these life-history characters {{remains an open}} question in social insect biology. Attempts to understand how a colony’s investment in reproduction is shaped by the queen and the workers have proved complicated because of the potential for queen–worker conflict over the colony’s investment in males versus females. Honeybees, in which this conflict is expected to be minimal or absent, provide an opportunity to more clearly study how the actions and interactions of individuals influence the colony’s production and regu-lation of males (drones). We examined whether honeybee queens can influence drone regulation by either allowing or prevent-ing them from laying <b>drone</b> <b>eggs</b> {{for a period of time}} and then examining their subsequent tendency to lay <b>drone</b> and worker <b>eggs.</b> Queens who initially laid <b>drone</b> <b>eggs</b> subsequently laid fewer <b>drone</b> <b>eggs</b> than the queens who were initially prevented from producing <b>drone</b> <b>eggs.</b> This indicates that a colony’s regulation of drones may be achieved not only by the workers, who build wax cells for drones and feed the larvae, but also by the queen, who can modify her production of <b>drone</b> <b>eggs.</b> In order to better understand how the queen and workers contribute to social insect colony decisions, future work should attempt to distinguish between actions that reflect conflict over sex allocation and those that reflect cooperation and shared control over the colony’s investment in reproduction. Key words: cooperation, drone production, honeybee, queen–worker conflict, sequential decision making.

25|$|Queens {{typically}} {{mate with}} multiple drones {{on more than}} one mating flight. Once mated, they lay eggs and fertilize them as needed from sperm stored in the spermatheca. Since the number of sex alleles is limited at a regional level, a queen will most likely mate with one or more drones having sex alleles identical with one of the sex alleles in the queen. The queen, then, typically produces a percentage of diploid <b>drone</b> <b>eggs.</b>|$|R
40|$|Honey bee (Apis mellifera) drones {{and workers}} show {{differences}} in morphology, physiology, and behavior. Because {{the functions of}} drones are more related to colony reproduction, and those of workers relate to both survival and reproduction, we hypothesize that the microclimate for worker brood is more precisely regulated than that of drone brood. We assessed temperature and relative humidity (RH) inside honey bee colonies for both drone and worker brood throughout the three-stage development period, using digital HOBO® Data Loggers. The major {{findings of this study}} are that 1) both drone and worker castes show the highest temperature for eggs, followed by larvae and then pupae; 2) temperature in drones are maintained at higher precision (smaller variance) in <b>drone</b> <b>eggs</b> and larvae, but at a lower precision in pupae than the corresponding stages of workers; 3) RH regulation showed higher variance in drone than workers across all brood stages; and 4) RH regulation seems largely due to regulation by workers, as the contribution from empty honey combs are much smaller compared to that from adult workers. We conclude that honey bee colonies maintain both temperature and humidity actively; that the microclimate for sealed drone brood is less precisely regulated than worker brood; and that combs with honey contribute very little to the increase of RH in honey bee colonies. These findings increase our understanding of microclimate regulation in honey bees and may have implications for beekeeping practices...|$|R
50|$|Like in {{most social}} bees, {{there are three}} main social caste {{divisions}} in B. terrestris. This ensures a division of labor and efficient colony functioning. Queens become the main female individual to reproduce in a future colony. There is only one per colony. Her sole responsibility is to lay eggs after she founds a nest. This fate is determined for larvae that receive more food, have longer instar stages, {{and higher levels of}} juvenile hormone biosynthesis. Workers, an entirely female caste, mainly forage for food, defend the colony, and tend to the growing larvae. They are usually sterile for most of the colony cycle and do not raise their own young. Unlike queens and workers, which develop from fertilized diploid <b>eggs,</b> <b>drones,</b> or male bees, are born from unfertilized, haploid <b>eggs.</b> <b>Drones</b> leave the colony shortly after reaching adulthood to find a mate outside the nest. Mating is their sole role in the colony.|$|R
25|$|Workers {{and queens}} (both female) result from fertilized eggs, so have both {{a mother and}} a father. Arrhenotokous parthenogenesis, a {{modified}} form of parthenogenesis, controls sex differentiation. The sex allele is polymorphic, and so long as two different variants are present, a female bee results. If both sex alleles are identical, diploid drones are produced. Honey bees detect and destroy diploid <b>drones</b> after the <b>eggs</b> hatch.|$|R
40|$|Israeli acute {{paralysis}} virus (IAPV) {{together with}} Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) and Kashmir bee virus (KBV) constitute {{a complex of}} closely related dicistroviruses. They are infamous for their high mortality after injection in honeybees. These viruses have also been reported in non-Apis hymenopteran pollinators such as bumblebees, which got infected with IAPV when placed in the same greenhouse with IAPV infected honeybee hives. Here we orally infected Bombus terrestris workers with different doses of either IAPV or KBV viral particles. The success of the infection was established by analysis of the bumblebees after the impact studies: 50 days after infection. Doses of 0. 5 x 10 (7) and 1 x 10 (7) virus particles per bee were infectious over this period, for IAPV and KBV respectively, while a dose of 0. 5 x 10 (6) IAPV particles per bee was not infectious. The impact of virus infection was studied in micro-colonies consisting of 5 bumblebees, one of which becomes a pseudo-queen which proceeds to lay unfertilized (<b>drone)</b> <b>eggs.</b> The impact parameters studied were: {{the establishment of a}} laying pseudo-queen, the timing of egg-laying, the number of drones produced, the weight of these drones and worker mortality. In this setup KBV infection resulted in a significant slower colony startup and offspring production, while only the latter can be reported for IAPV. Neither virus increased worker mortality, at the oral doses used. We recommend further studies on how these viruses transmit between different pollinator species. It is also vital to understand how viral prevalence can affect wild bee populations because disturbance of the natural host-virus association may deteriorate the already critically endangered status of many bumblebee species...|$|R
40|$|Proteolytic {{processes}} on {{the body}} surface of insects have barely been researched. In this work the body surface proteolytic activity was examined in different castes (queens, drones and workers). It was examined at various developmental stages (eggs, larvae, pupae and imagoes) in honey bees in spring, summer, autumn and winter. The following methods were used: protein content testing by the Lowry method (modified by Schacter le – Pol lack) and protease activity testing by the Anson method. Our studies revealed a high activity of proteases for the acidic (pH = 2. 4), neutral (pH = 7) and alkaline (pH = 11. 2) pH. The highest protein concentration values {{were found in the}} summer (in living drone pupae – 0. 7414 mg/ml; living mature queens – 0. 4701 mg/ml; worker larvae – 0. 8683 mg/ml). The lowest protein concentration values were in the spring (in mature workers – 0. 0015 mg/ml; dead drone pupae – 0. 0272 mg/ml). The worker, queen and <b>drone</b> <b>eggs</b> were found to have high protein concentrations in the summer. These high protein concentrations amounted to 0. 6264 mg/ml, 0. 4001 mg/ml, 0. 5793 mg/ml, respectively. However, they had very low proteolytic activity. High proteolytic activity was observed in the drones in the spring and in the workers in the summer. The lowest proteolytic activity was observed {{on the body}} surface of the queens. The larvae and pupae were found to have higher proteolytic activity than the imagines. Dead insects had higher proteolytic activity than living organisms. The obtained results revealed the initial pattern of proteolysis on the body surface of honey bees. The obtained results also confirm the validity for doing further biochemical research on body surface proteolytic activity in these insects...|$|R
50|$|Drones (males) are {{produced}} from unfertilized eggs, so they represent only the DNA {{of the queen}} that laid the eggs, i.e. have only a mother. Workers and queens (both female) result from fertilized eggs, so have both {{a mother and a}} father. Arrhenotokous parthenogenesis, a modified form of parthenogenesis, controls sex differentiation.

50|$|As the egg hatches, worker bees add {{royal jelly}} - a {{secretion}} from glands on {{the heads of}} young bees. For three days the young larvae are fed royal jelly, then they are fed nectar or diluted honey and pollen. A few female larvae in special queen cups may be selected to become queens. Their special queen cups are flooded with royal jelly for six days. The extra royal jelly speeds up the queen larvae development. Only the queen will have fully developed ovaries, i.e. she will be sexually mature.Drone brood develops from unfertilized <b>eggs.</b> <b>Drone</b> brood cells are larger than the cells of female worker bees.|$|R
50|$|Sex is {{determined}} through controlled fertilization of <b>eggs.</b> <b>Drones</b> are the fertilizers {{of the nest}} and will only fertilize the eggs laid by {{the queen of the}} colony. These fertilized eggs are heterozygous with complementary sex-determining loci and will always become female. Since drones do not fertilize the worker bees, the worker eggs are haploid, and they produce male offspring. However, workers are not always laying eggs. Thus, male production is limited to certain periods of time (see Male Production). While the workers of S. postica produce approximately 95% of all males, the queen still produces that remaining 5% of males. The queen will release some haploid eggs among her main diploid eggs. However, after the queen has produced a certain small number of male offspring, she will revert to producing females only.|$|R
40|$|Four queens, giving brood {{only half}} of whieh {{normally}} survived, were bred by individual sibling mating, To protect the brood of these queens from bees, pieces of eombs eontaining eggs were put into the ineubator, without bees. After the eggs hatehed, 707 larvae were grafted into queen eells on royal jeny, and were reared further in the ineubator. On the fifth day the sex ofthe live larvaecould bedetermined: half were female and half male. The viability of the diploid drone larvae was no lower up to this time than that of female larvae. Larvae were reared further, giving both queen and drone pupae and imagines. The larvae from so-called 'Iethal eggs', whieh are normally eaten in the hive, are thus viable diploid <b>drones</b> from fertilized <b>eggs.</b> This paper also reports {{for the first time}} the rearing of adult drones and of normai queens, beginning from the egg stage, outside the hive without any eontaet with bees...|$|R
5000|$|In many, but not {{all social}} insects, {{reproduction}} is monopolized by {{the queen of the}} colony. Due to the effects of a haplodiploid mating system, in which unfertilized <b>eggs</b> become male <b>drones</b> and fertilized <b>eggs</b> become worker females, average relatedness values between sister workers can be higher than those seen in humans or other eutherian mammals. This has led to the suggestion that kin selection may be a driving force in the evolution of eusociality, as individuals could provide cooperative care that establishes a favorable benefit to cost ratio (rB-c > 0). [...] However, not all social insects follow this rule. In the social wasp Polistes dominula, 35% of the nest mates are unrelated. In many other species, unrelated individuals only help the queen when no other options are present. In this case, subordinates work for unrelated queens even when other options may be present. No other social insect submits to unrelated queens in this way. This seemingly unfavorable behavior parallels some vertebrate systems. It is thought that this unrelated assistance is evidence of altruism in P. dominula.|$|R
40|$|Dwindling of colonies {{headed by}} laying workers is {{characteristic}} for all honeybee subspecies. This is obvious, because <b>drones</b> develop from <b>eggs</b> deposited by laying workers, and the colonies must parish. However, in Apis mellifera capensis worker bees develop from eggs deposited by laying workers. Nevertheless, A. m. capensis colonies headed by laying workers also dwindle. There are several {{reason for that}} phenomenon: 1. / A laying worker has fewer ovarioles than a queen, and therefore lays fewer eggs than a queen. Several laying workers may be active in a colony. Nevertheless, the number of eggs deposited by those workers is lower, than that of eggs deposited by a queen. 2. / Many larger workers, the so called false queens, develop in colonies headed by Cape laying workers. Behaviour of those workers differs probably from that of normal workers. 3. / Survival of brood produced by laying workers is lower, than that of brood produced by queen bees. The last phenomenon was investigated by us. Brood produced by laying workers is scattered. It is believed, that this is caused by irregular egg deposition by laying workers. However, {{this is not the}} cause. Eggs are found in quite compact are...|$|R
50|$|Development from egg to {{emerging}} bee varies among queens, workers, and drones. Queens emerge from their cells in 15-16 days, workers in 21 days, and drones in 24 days. Only one queen is usually {{present in a}} hive. New virgin queens develop in enlarged cells through differential feeding of royal jelly by workers. When the existing queen ages or dies or the colony becomes very large, a new queen is raised by the worker bees. When the hive is too large the old Queen will take half the hive and half the reserves with her in a swarm. This occurs a few days prior to the new queen hatching. If there are several Queen cells that were made then it means war. If several emerge they will begin piping (a high buzzing noise) signaling their location for the other virgin Queens to come fight. Once there is only one, she will go around the hive chewing the sides of any other cells and stinging and killing the would be queens. The virgin queen takes one or several nuptial flights. This is where the drone makes his entrance. They all leave the hive when the Queen is ready and mate, their member gets stuck in the Queen breaks off, then they fall to their death while another drone bee flies up removes the appendage and inserts his {{to do the same}} thing. She mates once she is established, and begins laying eggs. A fertile queen is able to lay fertilized or unfertilized eggs. Each unfertilized egg contains a unique combination of 50% of the queen's genes and develops into a haploid <b>drone.</b> The fertilized <b>eggs</b> develop into either diploid workers or virgin queens (but only if exclusively fed royal jelly).|$|R
40|$|In honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) {{the queen}} monopolises reproduction. However, {{especially}} after queen loss, workers can lay eggs, but {{are unable to}} mate. They produce haploid male offspring (<b>drones)</b> from unfertilised <b>eggs</b> via arrhenotokous parthenogenesis. In contrast, workers of the honeybee subspecies Apis mellifera capensis Eschscholtz typically produce diploid female offspring from unfertilised eggs thelytokously. After queen loss and without queen-derived brood A. m. capensis colonies can successfully requeen from worker-derived brood. This, however, is a relatively rare event in wild populations. Moreover, workerderived queens were described to be smaller, more worker-like and reproductively inferior. On the other hand, the fixation of the thelytokous trait relies mainly on sufficient numbers of viable drones produced by worker-derived queens. Small numbers of reproductively inferior worker-derived queens in A. m. capensis populations would be clearly counterintuitive. It is therefore necessary to quantify the significance of worker-dependant queen rearing pathways on the individual (queen) and on population level. Reproductive inferiority of worker-derived queens could not be confirmed on the individual (queen) level when comparing parameters indicating potential reproductive success of queen- and worker-derived queens. Queen- and worker-derived queens clearly showed a congruent range of reproductive performance. In queen rearing preference tests, increased acceptance of worker-derived female larvae was exactly counterbalanced by increased mortality, resulting in {{an equal number of}} eclosing virgin queens from an equal number of grafts in both test groups. Larval survival and successful eclosion is a prerequisite for a queen’s reproductive success. I found no difference in eclosion success for queen- and worker-derived virgin queens, indicating a similar potential for reproductive success in both queen types. Assessments of the developmental patterns of colonies headed by both queen and worker-derived queens in long-term experiments revealed no significant differences in reproductive success. Colonies headed by queen-derived queens and colonies headed by worker-derived queens could not be separated when comparing the different developmental pathways observed or from differences in worker-force. Reproductive dominance in A. m. capensis appeared tobe determined by a function of relative compositional and absolute quantitative pheromonal patterns, where individuals, which produce compositionally most queen-like blends in highest quantities, occupy top positions. Queen- and worker-derived virgin queens occupied intermediate positions between pseudoqueens and mated queens. However, {{no significant differences between the}} pheromonal status of queen- and worker-derived virgin queens were observed, suggesting a similar range of reproductive dominance for both queen types. In behavioural bioassays queen- and worker-derived virgin queens appeared to be similarly attractive to clustering workers and to drones in a drone congregation area, indicating no differences in potential reproductive success for queens from both origins for those parameters. The significant influence of the queen substance 9 -ODA on attractiveness to workers and drones was confirmed. Rare requeening events from worker-derived female brood in queenless A. m. capensis do not satisfactorily explain the fixation of the thelytokous trait at a population level. I observed A. m. capensis worker ovipositing into empty artificial queen cell cups in queen-right colonies. The queen was confined behind a queen excluder grid in a separate compartment of the colony, to imitate reduced pheromonal flow, similar to swarming or superseding colonies. Eggs oviposited by workers in artificial queen cell cups were readily accepted for queen rearing and successful eclosion of viable virgin queens was observed. Consequently I suggested an alternative worker-dependant reproductive pathway in A. m. capensis, which was never described before: In swarming or superseding queenright colonies, laying workers may directly compete with the queen for reproductive success by ovipositing (instead of the queen) into natural queen cell cups. At a population level this reproductive tactic may result in large numbers of worker-derived queens of high reproductive quality in natural populations of A. m. capensis. ...|$|R
