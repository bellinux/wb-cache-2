50|$|Thames lighters, or <b>dumb</b> <b>barge,</b> were {{non-self-propelled}} barges. The original Thames barges are the sailing vessels, {{many were}} converted for the war. LB or landing barges were used, some had ramps added and were called LBR or Landing Barge, Ramped. Some had engines and rudder added {{to be called}} LBV or Landing Barge Vehicle. They were used for different task: Landing Barges Oiler (LBO), Water (LBW), Kitchen (LBK) and Emergency Repair (LBE), Landing Barges Flak (LBF) and Gun (LBG). There was also one Landing Barge Cable (LBC). Many were used to for supplies to Normandy.|$|E
50|$|Scarrs built dumb barges in {{addition}} to powered vessels. S.313 Ril Toto and S.314 Ril Dora were built as 75 by 20 ft lighters for the flour merchants Spillers in late 1923. Each had a 9 ft draught, and in 1982, both were bought by Waddingtons, a carrying company based at Swinton, South Yorkshire on the River Don Navigation. One end of each was removed, and the two parts were welded {{together to form a}} larger <b>dumb</b> <b>barge.</b> Ril Dora became the front part of the new barge, which was named Confidence. It was used to transfer large German castings from Hull to Doncaster, and to return them once they had been machined.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first of}} the {{exercises}} started 15 January on the beaches of Culebra and Vieques until March 15 in 1935. The lift was provided by 18 ships' boats and one <b>dumb</b> <b>barge</b> artillery lighter. Fleet Landing Exercise Number 1 tested a series of theoretical and practical assumptions collected by the United States Marine Corps and Navy that soon became [...] "Tentative Landing Operations Manual" [...] of 1935. The exercises included landings, naval gunfire experiments, {{and the use of}} aviation in landing operations. Aircraft conducted aerial reconnaissance and bombardment sorties. The Caribbean fleet tested a range of weapons while the Marines moving from ship-to-shore employed machine guns, 81-mm mortars, and the 75-mm pack howitzers against beach targets. [...] Due to the mixed results experienced with the boats used in the exercise, the Marines concluded that landing boat design needed to be improved. In one of the experiments, a boat was successfully covered in a protective smoke screen, but this caused the landing party to immediately halt, and the waves broke up the unit, while many boats lost their way to the beachhead. [...] While the landing parties were ashore, the Navy held naval gunfire tests to assess the effects of different shells and fuses. These test concluded that area suppressing fire was far better than attempting pin-point bombardment. [...] However, many supporting fire practices, both by aircraft and warships, were strictly limited due to safety precautions for the Marines conducting maneuvers along the beach. The outcome of these exercises convinced the Marines that better landing craft and boats were needed, as well as more dependable communications equipment and techniques.|$|E
50|$|As {{for so many}} designs, {{they were}} {{replaced}} by motor vessels after WWII as cheaper to operate. The last to operate were as <b>dumb</b> <b>barges</b> on the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal in the 1940s.|$|R
50|$|A typical train {{consisted}} of a mechanically propelled barge carrying 60 tons, towing three <b>dumb</b> <b>barges</b> each of which had 120 tons of goods. The largest trains of barges could carry 600 tons of cargo.|$|R
50|$|Most Mersey flats {{had been}} {{converted}} to <b>dumb</b> <b>barges</b> {{by the end of}} the 19th century, towed by horses or by steam tugs. The larger Weaver flats were fitted with steam engines, and later with diesel engines, although there were still around 20 working by sail in 1935. Both the Liverpool Maritime Museum and the Ellesmere Port Museum have a Mersey flat in their collections, neither of which actually worked under sail.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, the {{powerful}} motor vessels and <b>dumb</b> <b>barges</b> {{owned by the}} company had a total carrying capacity of 4,500 tons. Each day, vessels were in attendance {{at each of the}} Hull docks and consignments of five tons and upwards were collected direct overside from steamers. Under an ancient charter, the port of Hull is free to river and canal craft. No wharfage or landing charges were incurred when cargo was directly discharged into the company's boats.|$|R
50|$|In 1927, {{they built}} 160 {{passenger}} coaches {{for use in}} India. To transport them, Cammell Laird asked Watsons of Gainsborough to build five <b>dumb</b> <b>barges.</b> The coaches were loaded onto the barges at Clifton, near Nottingham on the River Trent, and towed in pairs downriver by a twin-screwed tug named Motorman, built by Henry Scarr of Hessle in 1925. They were taken to Hull for export. In 1929, the railway rolling stock business of Cammell Laird was spun off and merged to become Metropolitan-Cammell Carriage and Wagon Company Ltd.|$|R
5|$|The main {{cargo carried}} was coal. In 1788, {{a group of}} {{shareholders}} set up a coal committee, and began trading. At first, the product came from the Staffordshire coalfields, travelling via the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, or from the Shropshire coalfields, but this was later supplemented by coal from the south Gloucestershire mines and then the Forest of Dean. This profitable business continued until 1833. Boats that worked the canal included Severn Trows, a type of sailing boat which was fitted with ketch, cutter or sloop rigging. Many were later converted for use as <b>dumb</b> <b>barges</b> by removing the masts, but none {{are known to have}} survived to the present day.|$|R
2500|$|Trade on {{the upper}} part of the {{navigation}} to Stowmarket was extremely limited, with just an occasional barge carrying manure to Prentice's Manure Works, and returning with guncotton, which was manufactured at an explosives works. There was more traffic between Ipswich and Bramford, as barges regularly worked to Fison's and Packard's factories. The companies paid lower tolls because they helped to maintain the lock gates and clear weeds from the channel. 30-ton barges were worked through the lower four locks in trains of two <b>dumb</b> <b>barges</b> with a steam-powered barge pulling them. By 1917, the undertaking was virtually bankrupt. Income amounted to around £220 per year, with expenditure running at £480, and there was no capital left. The Trustees tried to make economies, but in May 1922, with the current account overdrawn, they resolved to close the navigation from 3 June 1922.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to new builds, {{the company also}} took on repair work, as in the late 1920s, both Good Luck, originally launched on 21 March 1904, and Motorman from 24 March 1925 were on stocks on the main slipway at the same time. Motorman, which was a twin-screw tug, fitted with two Gardner diesel engines, each developing , was used to transfer railway carriages from Carlton near Nottingham on the River Trent to Hull in 1927. 160 carriages were built by Cammell Laird for export to India. They could not be transported by rail, because they were built to Indian gauge rather than the British standard gauge, and were therefore too large. Cammell Laird ordered five <b>dumb</b> <b>barges</b> from Watsons shipyard at Gainsborough, and the tug towed trains of two barges, each loaded with one carriage, down the River Trent.|$|R

5000|$|The site of {{the wreck}} of Zanoni is now {{protected}} by a 550 m exclusion zone. No boating of any kind is permitted inside this zone, {{in an attempt to}} protect what remains of the ship from damage from fishing nets and boat anchors. The No 5 <b>dumb</b> hopper <b>barge</b> was scuttled in 1984 [...] south of Zanoni to provide an alternate artificial reef for fishing.|$|R
5000|$|No 5 <b>dumb</b> hopper <b>barge</b> was {{a hopper}} barge {{which was built}} in 1911 at Balmain in New South Wales by Poole & Steel for the then Marine Board of South Australia, an agency of the Government of South Australia. She {{was part of a}} fleet of vessels used to dredge the {{shipping}} approaches to Port Adelaide and other ports in South Australia. Her specific role was to hold spoil from the dredging process and convey it under tow to a dumping site. In 1978, she became redundant after the purchase of two self-propelled barges.|$|R
