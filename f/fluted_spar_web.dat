40|$|An {{investigation}} is {{performed on the}} implementation of bending-torsion coupling of a composite wind turbine rotor blade to provide passive pitch-control. Limited passive torsion deformation is realised with a structural coupling between flapwise bending and elastic twist of a constant speed rotor-blade. The blade and skin laminate configuration are analysed with a FEM program, in which a complete blade with <b>spar</b> <b>webs</b> is modelled. This conventional blade configuration has some disadvantages. Therefore alternative design concepts are reviewed, where the coupling plies are restricted to a load-bearing spar, while a softer skin provides for the aerodynamic shape. From additional analysis, it is found that, while for the two alternative design concepts the stress concentrations {{at the leading edge}} joint are bypassed, the bending-torsion coupling response is lower. An experiment was performed to validate the calculation methods. The experimental results show good correlation with theoretical predictions.

40|$|Wing joint {{design is}} one of the most {{critical}} areas in aircraft structures. Efficient and damage tolerant wing-fuselage integration structure, applicable to the next generation of transport aircraft, will facilitate the realisation of the benefits offered by new aircraft concepts. The Blended Wing Body (BWB) aircraft concept represents a potential revolution in subsonic transport efficiency for large airplanes. Studies have shown the BWB to be superior to conventional airframes in all key measures. Apart from the aerodynamic advantages, the BWB aircraft also provides a platform for wing-fuselage design changes. The main objective of this research is to design a damage tolerant wing-fuselage joint with a novel bird’s mouth termination for a BWB aircraft that has a similar payload range to the B 767 aircraft. The damage tolerance analysis of the proposed BWB wing/fuselage integration structure includes assessments of fatigue crack growth life, residual strength and inspection capability. The proposed structure includes a bird’s mouth termination of the spars that facilitates smooth transfer of loading from the <b>spar</b> <b>web</b> into the root rib and the upper and lower skins and is novel in its application to the blended wing body configuration. A finite element analysis was required to determine local stresses for the prediction of fatigue crack growth life, residual strength and inspection capability and to identify weak spots in the proposed structure. The project aircraft wing comprises of three spars (front, centre and rear) and a false rear spar thus defining a four cell wing box. Wing root shear, bending moment and torque loads were derived and applied to a thin-walled three box idealisation of the proposed structure. The challenges experienced in replicating the loads obtained from the three box idealisation were addressed by modification of the boundary conditions. Checks for compression and shear buckling were also undertaken that confirmed that the applied loads were below the limits of the proposed structure. The finite element analysis showed very clearly that the stresses in the novel bird’s mouth spar termination were significantly lower than in the skin and that the skin remained the more critical damage tolerant component at the wing root when the structure was subjected to ultimate design stresses. The <b>spar</b> <b>web</b> at the bird’s mouth termination was shown to have a larger crack growth life compared to the skin. The thickness of the skin requires further investigation as a significant amount of local bending was experienced due to the applied pressure. The skin will sustain a two-bay crack at the design limit load thus proving the proposed wing fuselage integration structure to be damage tolerant. In conclusion, the main objective of the thesis has been achieved. An integrated wingfuselage joint with novel bird’s mouth spar termination and surrounding structure have been designed and substantiated (evaluated) by damage tolerance requirements.

The Adaptive Torsion Wing (ATW) concept is a thin-wall, two-spar wingbox whose torsional stiffness can be adjusted by translating the <b>spar</b> <b>webs</b> in the chordwise direction inward and towards each other using internal actuators. The reduction in torsional stiffness allows external aerodynamic loads to induce twist on the structure and maintain its deformed shape.

40|$|Stiffened {{panels are}} widely used in {{aircraft}} structures such as wing covers, fuselages, control surfaces, <b>spar</b> <b>webs,</b> bulkheads, and floors. The detailed sizing of minimum-weight stiffened panels involves many considerations. Use of composite materials introduces additional complexities. Many potential modes of failure exist. Analyses for these modes are often not trivial, especially for those involving large out-of-plane displacements. Accurate analyses of all potential failure modes are essential. Numerous practical constraints arise from manufacturing/cost considerations and from damage tolerance, durability, and stiffness requirements. The number of design variables can be large when lamina thicknesses and stacking sequence are being optimized. A significant burden {{is placed on the}} sizing code due to the complex analyses, practical constraints, and number of design variables. On the other hand, sizing weight-efficient panels without the aid of an automated procedure is almost out of the question. The sizing code postbuckled Open-Stiffener Optimum Panels (POSTOP) has been developed to aid in the design of minimum-weight panels subject to the considerations mentioned above. Developed for postbuckled composite panels, POSTOP may be used for buckling resistant panels and metallic panels as well.

40|$|AbstractMonitoring {{technique}} for detection of early {{damage in the}} wind turbine blade has been investigated using PVDF film sensor and strain gages. The trailing edge component with shear web was prepared by sectioning the full-scale blade with a box spa. Several PVDF film sensors with dimension of 10 x 10 x 0. 054 mm 3 and strain gages were installed on shear web and skin of the component and the behaviour of these sensors were examined under opening and closing loads. From the test, optimal location for detecting the occurrence of damage with static loading was investigated and sensitivity of the PVDF sensors location to the damage was examined. With increasing the applied load, several pop-ins happened up to final failure. The outputs of the PVDF film sensors under quasi-static loads showed the relatively insignificant magnitude and peaks corresponding to pop-ins. So, {{it is found that}} PVDF film sensors mounted on the trailing edge component give an early response remarkably to the damage occurrence irrespective to the closing and opening loads. Therefore, it can be said the PVDF film sensors may be significantly useful in detecting the instance of damage occurrence in the trailing edge component. Further, it can be recommended that the relatively good location of the PVDF sensor to detect the damage in the trailing edge component be the locations free to the geometrical constraint, like the center of <b>spar</b> <b>web</b> and the blade skin remote from the joint between the spa cap and the shear web...|$|R

In {{the case of}} airplane wing, there are two primary requirements which must be considered during the structural design process: high strength and stiffness, and lower weight. Due to the restricted nature of technology in this field, very few design guidelines are available for design improvement of an airplane wing structure to increase its strength-to-weight ratio. The objective of this thesis is to provide guidelines {{for the improvement of}} the structural design of a composite unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) wing with respect to weight, strength and bending stiffness, with Aludra MK- 01 as a case study. The finite element method was used for the numerical analysis on the structure. Popular commercial finite element software, ABAQUS CAE, was used to model the wing structure. A detailed modelling technique for composite structure and the attachment between structures was presented in this thesis. The wing finite element model was validated using experimental results. The design improvement process on the wing structures was conducted in several modes. The variables used in the process were <b>spar</b> <b>web</b> length, <b>spar</b> shape and spar thicknesses.

The variation of these criteria with changes in selected parameters were then plotted to observe the design trends.

During the design improvement process, the failure index was found to be most sensitive towards the changes in the variable parameters compared to structural weight and bending stiffness.

5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 1979, Morry Hummel, {{who worked in the}} Curtis Wright {{experimental}} department during World War II, purchased the plans for Gary Watson’s Windwagon and the development of the [...] "Hummel Bird" [...] began. Because of the weather in Hummel's state of Ohio, a canopy was needed. The horizontal stabilizer attach construction was redesigned. The seat back was raised 5 inches so a shoulder harness could be added, and the instrument panel was raised 2 inches, increasing fuel capacity and leg room. The wing was completely re-engineered. The dihedral break on the Windwagon was in the middle; Morry made the center wing section straight and put the dihedral break {{at the point where the}} outer wing panels bolt to the center section. The Hummel Bird spar is built up of 1/8 6061-t6 aluminum angle spar caps, with a [...]040, 2024-t3 <b>spar</b> <b>web.</b> The <b>spar</b> cap angles are doubled in the center section, and tapered in the outer panels. The number of ribs was increased, the thickness of the skin was reduced, and the skins get even thinner toward the tips. The ribs are now a two piece design with one in front of the spar(nose rib) and one between the spars(main rib). The skins are riveted to the spars leaving no bump where the one piece ribs previously pushed the skin up where it crossed the spar. Both the Teenie Two and the Windwagon had tricycle landing gear, however, Morry preferred conventional landing gear so taildragger gear became a popular option. There were other changes as well, compromising a significant improvement over the wind wagon. He finished his project in July 1980. In July 1982, the plane was featured in an article written by Jack Cox, of Sport Aviation. Jack dubbed Morry’s new creation the “Hummel Bird” and the name stuck.|$|R

40|$|Renewable energy {{extracted}} from wind turbines is extensively {{used to reduce}} the dependence from fossil fuels. It {{has been shown that}} in order to carry on to the way of efficiency, it is necessary to increase the size of wind turbines. However, following this road, new challenges with major complexity are expected to show up. As wind turbine size increase, loads increase too, so it is critical to maintain the structural integrity of them, especially for the case of the blades. This research focuses explicitly on a particular aspect of structural design which is reported to be very critical in many designs of wind turbine blade wing box structures, namely the connection between the <b>spar</b> <b>web</b> and the <b>spar</b> cap. A pyramid structured approach is developed which links local phenomena of stress transfer and failure in the adhesive joint to overall loads on the entire machine. On the top of the pyramid where the wind turbine blade is analysed as such, a fully automated procedure is developed to model the relevant aspects of both structural design and load application in a comprehensive way and to propagate the effect of external loads to internal stresses in the critical components. Bonded joints in wind turbine blades have particular characteristics including unusually high thicknesses in the adhesive layers and a multi-axial stress state. On the second level, a subcomponent structure is designed as a C-beam and an experimental and numerical procedure is performed. At the lowest level of the pyramid, an extensive experimental campaign is performed in materials such as pure adhesive and bonded joint specimens which are developed specifically {{to take into account the}} particular requirements for application in wind turbine blades. Coupons are subjected both to quasi static and fatigue loads at different conditions. In order to take into account variability present in the experimental campaign, a probabilistic approach is used to identify the most appropriate failure criterion. The strength prediction method considers a statistical size effect in the strength of the material by considering not only the magnitude of the stress distributions, but also the volume over which they act. Both quasi-static and fatigue results are analysed using probabilistic tools, leading to a good correlation. status: publishe...|$|R
