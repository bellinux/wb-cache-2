40|$|Regardless {{of how you}} {{resolve the}} {{morality}} of our history, {{the fact is that}} Currier and Ives documented in their own special and often biased way the iconography of the growth and development of the United States of America (Fig. 88) {{in some of the most}} eventful years of its history from about 1840 through 1895. Now, as we near our 500 th anniversary commemoration of Columbus' voyage to the Americas, it seems especially appropriate to review [...] to think about all of this. I think you have sensed, as we have gone along, that learning about Currier and his colleagues [...] these pacesetters of the American Image [...] has meant, as Osler predicted, a pleasant diversion for me. These activities have carried me into new areas of interest, expanding my perspective of the American Image [...] of people, of medicine, of life in general, and aiding in the identification of values, my own, as well as those of others. All along, my <b>knowledge</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>enhanced,</b> especially of the history of this wonderful complex country of ours. Furthermore, and of considerable importance, this endeavor has sharpened my power of observation. I have, like a good doctor should do, learned to look better...|$|E

40|$|Simulations {{have become}} a {{powerful}} mechanism for understanding and modeling complex phenomena. Their results have had substantial impact on {{a broad range of}} decisions in the military, government, and industry. Because of this, new techniques are continually being explored and developed to make them even more useful, understandable, extendable, and efficient. One such area of research is the application of the knowledge-based methods of artificial intelligence (AI) to the computer simulation field. The goal of knowledge-based simulation is to facilitate building simulations of greatly increased power and comprehensibility by making use of deeper knowledge about the behavior of the simulated world. One technique for representing and manipulating <b>knowledge</b> that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>enhanced</b> by the AI community is object-oriented programming. Using this technique, the entities of a discrete-event simulation can be viewed as objects in an object-oriented formulation. Knowledge can be factual (i. e., attributes of an entity) or behavioral (i. e., how the entity is to behave in certain circumstances). Rome Laboratory's Advanced Simulation Environment (RASE) was developed as a research vehicle to provide an enhanced simulation development environment for building more intelligent, interactive, flexible, and realistic simulations. This capability will support current and future battle management research and provide a test of the object-oriented paradigm for use in large scale military applications...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlthough {{morphological}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{proposed to}} <b>enhance</b> second language (L 2) vocabulary acquisition, {{little is known}} about which morphological process has the greatest impact on lexical acquisition. To address this question, 400 school-learners of English from high schools in Saudi Arabia were presented with a morphological decomposition task of regular and irregular inflection and derivation, and an L 2 vocabulary size test. The results indicated some significant levels of correlation between knowledge of regular inflection and derivation, and L 2 vocabulary knowledge. Irregular inflection and derivation, on the contrary, were not found to {{have a significant effect on}} L 2 vocabulary acquisition. Although significant correlations were observed between regular morphology and L 2 vocabulary learning, regression analysis showed that only regular inflection processing has a sizable effect on vocabulary uptake. This variable explained about 38 % of the variance per se. The findings also revealed no clear effect of the first language (L 1) regularity of morphological rules, which apply extensively in Arabic, on acquiring words that are regular in English. The overall findings propose an explicit focus on teaching regular inflectional morphology in the language classroom because of its marked influence found on vocabulary acquisition...|$|R
30|$|Structural {{knowledge}} of −ssRNA virus RNPs was initiated by studying non-segmented −ssRNA viruses, including Borna disease virus (BDV) (Rudolph et al., 2003), rabies virus (Albertini et al., 2006), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Green et al., 2006), and {{respiratory syncytial virus}} (RSV) (Tawar et al., 2009), and this <b>knowledge</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> greatly <b>enhanced</b> by recent investigations of segmented −ssRNA viruses, including arenaviruses (Hastie et al., 2011 a, b; Qi et al., 2011), bunyaviruses (Dong et al., 2013; Ferron et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2012; Jiao et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013; Niu et al., 2013; Raymond et al., 2010), and influenza virus (Ng et al., 2008; Ye et al., 2006; Arranz et al., 2013; Chenavas et al., 2013; Moeller et al., 2013). Furthermore, advances in the visualization of native or authentic RNP through electron microscopy led {{to the understanding of}} the dynamic processes of RNP formation at molecular level. In particular, recent results have clearly demonstrated that viral NP could be directly used as the target for antiviral development (Gerritz et al., 2011; Kao et al., 2010), raising a great potential to find new antiviral agents with novel mechanism against drug resistance occurred in traditional antiviral drugs. Recent work on cryo-electron microscopy and tomography help us visualize Filoviridae virus particles and formation of nucleocapsid (Bharat et al., 2012; Bharat et al., 2011). However, the structural details of EBOV NP and the molecular mechanism of EBOV RNP formation are largely unknown. The exclusive structural information is that a recent work identified the boundaries of N- and C-terminal domains of EBOV NP and solve the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain spanning residues 641 – 739 (Dziubanska et al., 2014). However, the structure of C-terminal domain of EBOV NP did not hint to the biological function of this region. All of these promote us to initiate the biochemical and structural analysis on EBOV NP to achieve the understanding of the mechanism of EBOV RNP formation and explore the potential drug target for the discovery of anti-EBOV agents.|$|R
40|$|This thesis, {{based on}} a project {{realised}} in cooperation with Électricité de France (EDF), proposes a new concept for a Decision Aid Function FOr Restoration (DAFFOR) of transmission power systems after a blackout. DAFFOR is an interactive computer tool which provides the operators in power system control centres with guidance concerning the actions to execute during the restoration, in real-time conditions. In other words, it {{takes into account the}} real-time state of the power system, including the unforeseen events that may happen during the restoration. Since time is a limiting factor and the decision making is a highly combinatorial problem, a knowledge-based system is proposed in order to solve it. The restoration process can be decomposed into two main stages. The first one, skeleton creation, consists of starting the production units and connecting some transmission devices in order to energize a strong network. The second stage, load pickup, aims to supply the consumers. In DAFFOR, EDF's strategy for the first restoration stage <b>has</b> <b>been</b> implemented, and a new strategy for the load pickup stage <b>has</b> <b>been</b> proposed and implemented in the form of rules. The above restoration strategies represent DAFFOR's <b>knowledge,</b> which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>enhanced</b> with a number of heuristics. DAFFOR consists of two kernels: the Reasoning kernel and the Real Time Update kernel. The Reasoning kernel has the task of assisting the operator during the restoration process and is the interactive guidance part of DAFFOR. It can either suggest a control action to execute on the power system to the operators or assess a control action provided by the operators. The control action is suggested with respect to operating limits (over- and under-voltages, frequency excursions and overloads) and according to knowledge (restoration strategy and heuristics). The feasibility of an action is tested within an internal dynamic simulator, which also takes into account the time necessary to physically execute an action (e. g., telephone a person in the field). The Reasoning kernel can adapt its operation via data generated by the Real Time Update (RTUpd) kernel. The RTUpd kernel steadily reads real-time power system data from System Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) function and those entered by the operators (if unavailable from SCADA). It generates a coherent data set, which is the only real-time information available to the Reasoning kernel, and the message which indicates to the Reasoning kernel how to continue its operation. In addition to the real-time data, the RTUpd kernel has two feedback inputs internal to DAFFOR: a coherent data set generated in the previous data processing by the RTUpd kernel itself, and a simulated data set generated by the Reasoning kernel (i. e., its internal dynamic simulator). With these three inputs, the RTUpd kernel generates the current image of the power system, and identifies unforeseen events. Thanks to the RTUpd kernel, the Reasoning kernel may keep up with the dynamic evolution of the power system. The stand-alone prototype of DAFFOR <b>has</b> <b>been</b> tested with data provided by EDF, and shown very good efficiency. At present, it is about to be coupled with the EDF's operator training simulator in order to test its real-time functionality. This work also proposes an original method aimed at the determination of a strategy for the load pickup stage. A genetic algorithm <b>has</b> <b>been</b> developed which generates the optimized sequences of manoeuvres for different initial states of the power system for the second restoration stage. It uses the dynamic simulator as its evaluation function. The obtained results have shown that some additional manipulations should be done in order to deduce generic rules for the load pickup strategy. At present, the obtained sequences are classified in a decision tree, which permits the most adequate sequence for the initial state to be chosen...|$|R
40|$|Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is {{a widely}} {{researched}} technology for developing knowledge-based systems {{in a range of}} real-world application domains such as medical diagnosis, help-desk service, product recommendation, classification, and configuration or planning. The fundamental premise of CBR is that experience in the form of past cases can be leveraged to solve new problems. This paradigm arises from the fact that in many application domains, similar problems usually have similar solutions. Retrieval is often considered an important phase in CBR, since it lays the foundation for the overall effectiveness of CBR systems. The aim of retrieval in CBR is to retrieve useful cases that can be successfully used to solve the target problem. If the retrieved cases are not useful or relevant, CBR systems will not eventually produce good solutions for the problem. Therefore, the success of any CBR systems is strongly reliant on the performance of retrieval. The retrieval strategy in CBR systems typically relies on exploiting similarity knowledge and is referred to as similarity-based retrieval (SBR). Similarity measures are used in SBR to approximate the usefulness of cases with respect to the target problem. However, a limitation of SBR is that it tends to rely primarily on similarity knowledge, ignoring other forms of knowledge that can be further leveraged for improving retrieval performance. While many kinds of learnt and induced <b>knowledge</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used to <b>enhance</b> traditional SBR, this thesis demonstrates that association analysis of stored cases can enhance and improve traditional SBR. In this thesis, we propose and develop a novel retrieval strategy USIMSCAR that combines association knowledge with similarity knowledge. The aim of association knowledge is to represent a set of strongly evident, interesting relationships between known problem features and known solutions which are shared by a large number of cases. We formulate and represent association knowledge for CBR systems using a special type of association rules that we term soft-matching class association rules (scars). Through extensive experiments, we experimentally demonstrate the improvement of our proposed USIMSCAR over SBR using both benchmark and real datasets in three CBR application domains: medical diagnosis, help-desk service support, and product recommendation domains. Throughout our experimental evaluation, we validate that USIMSCAR is an effective retrieval strategy for CBR that enhances and improves SBR. We also evaluate the statistical significance of the accuracy and effectiveness obtained by USIMSCAR when compared with traditional SBR. The contributions of this thesis are as follows: (1) we propose and develop an approach for formalizing association knowledge for CBR systems acquired from association analysis of stored cases using association rule mining, (2) we propose and develop innovative strategies for measuring the usefulness of cases as well as directly leveraging interesting rules encoding association knowledge, with respect to the target problem, (3) we propose and develop a novel retrieval strategy that substantially improves SBR by using both similarity and association knowledge. In summary, in this thesis, we have addressed the problem of SBR, and proposed and developed an effective retrieval strategy using association analysis techniques to enhance traditional SBR.
