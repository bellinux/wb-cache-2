5|$|Since Ankylosaurus {{and other}} Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids grouped with Asian genera (in a tribe the authors named Ankylosaurini), Arbour and Currie {{suggested}} that earlier North American ankylosaurids had gone extinct {{by the late}} Albian or Cenomanian ages of the Middle Cretaceous. Ankylosaurids thereafter recolonised North America from Asia during the Campanian or Turonian ages of the Late Cretaceous, and diversified there again, leading to genera such as Ankylosaurus, Anodontosaurus, and Euoplocephalus. This <b>explains</b> <b>a</b> 30 million year gap in the fossil record of North American ankylosaurids between these ages.|$|E

25|$|With {{the goal}} of {{explaining}} Epicurean philosophy to a Roman audience, the Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius wrote De Rerum Natura (The Nature of Things) in 50 BC.

Elsewhere throughout its range, it is uncommon to scarce, including Nepal where habitat destruction most certainly <b>explains</b> <b>a</b> rapid decline in population numbers in that area.|$|E

25|$|Peter Temin an {{economist}} at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology <b>explains</b> <b>a</b> tariff is an expansionary policy, like a devaluation as it diverts demand from foreign to home producers. He notes that exports were 7 percent of GNP in 1929, they fell by 1.5 percent of 1929 GNP {{in the next two years}} and the fall was offset by the increase in domestic demand from tariff. He concludes that contrary the popular argument, contractionary effect of the tariff was small.|$|E

25|$|Kinetic isotope {{effects are}} common in {{biological}} systems and are especially important for hydrogen isotope biogeochemistry. Kinetic effects usually result in larger fractionations than equilibrium reactions. In any isotope system, kinetic effects are stronger for larger mass differences. Light isotopes in most systems also tend to move faster but form weaker bonds. At high temperatures, entropy <b>explains</b> <b>a</b> large signal in isotope composition. However, when temperature decreases isotope effects are more expressed and randomness plays less of a role. These general trends are exposed in further understanding of bond breaking, diffusion or effusion, and condensation or evaporation reactions.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} of the opposing armies <b>explains</b> <b>a</b> lot about {{the outcome of the}} ensuing conflict. The Tibetan soldiers were almost all rapidly impressed peasants, who lacked organisation, discipline, training and motivation. Only a handful of their most devoted units, comprising monks armed usually with swords and jingals, proved to be effective, but they were in such small numbers as to be unable to reverse the tide of battle. This problem was exacerbated by their generals, who seemed in awe of the British and refused to make any aggressive moves against the small and often dispersed column. They also failed conspicuously to properly defend their natural barriers, frequently offering battle in relatively open ground, where Maxim guns and rifle volleys caused great numbers of casualties.|$|E
25|$|As this is {{a sacred}} ceremony, people are {{typically}} reluctant to discuss it in any great detail. Given {{a long history of}} cultural misappropriation, indigenous people are suspicious that non-Natives may abuse or misuse the traditional ways. Elders and medicine men are concerned that the ceremony should only be passed along in the right ways. The words used at a sun dance are often in the native language and are not translated for outsiders. Not talking about this ceremony is part of the respect the people display for it. In addition, the detailed way in which a respected elder speaks, teaches, and <b>explains</b> <b>a</b> sun dance to younger members of the tribe is unique and not easily quoted, nor is it intended for publication.|$|E

25|$|Generally {{known as}} his chief work, the Mythologies (Latin: Mitologiarum libri III) {{is a series}} of legends told in three books. Each book is {{introduced}} by its own prologue. There are a total of fifty chapters: each chapter <b>explains</b> <b>a</b> classical myth and interprets that myth using allegory. These interpretations include etymologies of the names of certain characters, as well as conclusions as to the purpose of the story in terms of morality. In the prologue, Fulgentius claims that his purpose was to strip the classic Greek myths of all their fictitious and meaningless details in order to reveal the obscure truths they contain. He also suggests a Christian motive, though it would be inaccurate to define the Mythologies or any of Fulgentius' allegorical works as 'Christian allegories'.|$|E
25|$|The {{competition}} between Holly and Sebastian {{for the center}} ring develops into a romantic triangle as well, with both Sebastian and Brad vying for Holly as the aerialists' acts become increasingly daring and dangerous. Sebastian ignores his former lovers on the show: Angel, who performs in the elephant act; and Phyllis, who does a double turn as an iron jaw artist and a vocalist, starring in a South Seas spectacular built around her talent as a singer. The duel ends when, {{in response to a}} challenge from Holly, Sebastian removes his safety net and suffers serious injuries in a fall when a trick goes wrong. Buttons tends to him; and when the show's doctor expresses admiration for the way he dealt with the injuries, the clown <b>explains,</b> <b>a</b> little nervously, that he used to be a pharmacist's mate. Holly finally has the center ring and star billing – but not the way she wanted it. Brad is unable to comfort her because she is in love with Sebastian.|$|E

Kyle and Stan are best friends, and their relationship, which is {{supposed}} to reflect the real-life friendship between Parker and Stone, is a common topic throughout the series. The two do have their disagreements, but always reconcile without any long-term damage to their friendship. The show's official website defines Kyle's role amongst his friends as [...] "the smart one". He often provides a sober thought to plans or ideas made by the other boys, and <b>explains</b> <b>a</b> moral outlook while drawing upon his vast knowledge and intelligence. He tends to offer reasonable or scientific explanations both to situations most others view as supernatural in nature, and in opposition of propaganda dispensed by Cartman.|$|E
