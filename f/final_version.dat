In the second draft, Perez was sucked through a fist-sized breach in the hull of the Auriga; this was changed in the <b>final</b> <b>version</b> to the Newborn being sucked through the window of the Betty. 20th Century Fox executives were skeptical about the <b>final</b> <b>version,</b> seeing it as a comedic scene contrasting with the overall tone of the Alien franchise, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet persuaded them to leave the scene in.|$|E

The sonatas were labeled Sonate I, II, III, respectively, and Schubert wrote {{at the bottom of the}} last folio of the third sonata the date September 26.

He had been able to construct different rooms in the games (thirty in the <b>final</b> <b>version),</b> in days where most games took place only on a single screen. Further, off-screen objects such as the bat would continue to move according to their programming behavior.|$|E
5|$|Fauré {{revised and}} {{enlarged}} the Requiem {{in the years}} between its first performance in 1888 and {{the publication of the}} <b>final</b> <b>version</b> in 1901. The latter is scored for full orchestra; since the 1970s attempts have been made by several Fauré scholars to reconstruct the composer's earlier versions, scored for smaller orchestral forces.|$|E
5|$|Ibira {{initially}} pictured Karas as {{a horror}} {{story with a}} vengeance theme. It had a simple plot similar to the manga, Dororo. The protagonist karas is on a quest, slaughtering mikuras to recover the body parts of his murdered lover. Until he recovers all the parts, he assembles them into a katana to kill the mikuras. The <b>final</b> <b>version</b> of Karas {{was more of a}} superhero action story, and originally intended for three leading heroes in the same vein as the Japanese period drama, Sanbiki ga Kiru!. The characters Otoha, Nue, and the human detective Kure were the leads but the <b>final</b> <b>version</b> primarily focused on Otoha. The presentation of Karas differs in several ways from typical anime. The show maintains a serious tone and never indulges in slapstick, exaggerated facial expressions, or super deformed characters. It avoids heavy expositions. Dialogue tends to be short and viewers have to infer what is going on based on very little presented information. The team had left out substantial amounts of information from the show, printing them in a booklet of the final DVD package.|$|E
