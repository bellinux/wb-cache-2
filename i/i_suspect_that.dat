That, of course, was not her way of doing things. She {{required}} no payment for the training she provided, and <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true {{to say that a}} great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E

In January 1925 Eden, disappointed {{not to have been}} offered a position, went {{on a tour of the}} Middle East, meeting Emir Feisal of Iraq. Feisal reminded him of the “Czar of Russia & (<b>I)</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> his fate may be similar” (a similar fate did indeed befall the Iraqi Royal Family in 1958). He inspected the oil refinery at Abadan, which he likened to “a Swansea on a small scale”.|$|E

Of this I am sure, that it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. Nobody knows how they swarm, except those to whom they {{naturally}} resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is bona fide, the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great many — the mass, indeed — are illiterate, and a great many waste their means, and are in or approaching penury. These discoverers despise one another.|$|E

500|$|Donald Zec in the Daily Mirror {{was equally}} damning of Lazenby's acting abilities, {{comparing}} him unfavourably to Connery: [...] "He looks uncomfortably {{in the part}} like a size four foot in a size ten gumboot." [...] Zec was kinder to Lazenby's co-star, saying that [...] "there is style to Diana Rigg's performance and <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> the last scene which draws something of a performance out of Lazenby owes much to her silken expertise." [...] The New York Times critic AH Weiler also weighed in against Lazenby, saying that [...] "Lazenby, if not a spurious Bond, is merely a casual, pleasant, satisfactory replacement." ...|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that}} Laurent should have {{received}} the nomination at the 16th Screen Actors Guild Awards saying, [...] "In drawing attention to one performer, in particular, whom they {{left out of the}} Best Supporting Actress category, [...] I flat-out adore this performance and <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> many others do too," [...] and further lauding Laurent's performance added, [...] " [...] is radiant and, in a unique Tarantino way, heartbreaking. Sexy and luminous in the heat of her valor. Putting out fire – and setting it. It becomes an anthem of noirish dread and excitement, a sign that Laurent, as Shosanna, has found her destiny." ...|$|E
500|$|Passing sentence, Rafferty said: [...] "You robbed three {{innocent}} {{ladies of}} their lives. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> their families will suffer the more as they simply don't {{understand why you}} did. The brutality of these ladies' deaths, designed by you to evade discovery, showing the coldness with which you dispatched them, is appalling. You should clearly have faced up like {{a man at the}} overwhelming nature of the Crown's case against you but you chose to put the victims' families through misery which you compounded by this trial." [...] The motive for Smith's actions remained unclear after the trial, but police believed a [...] "lack of permanent sexual relations" [...] had been a contributing factor.|$|E

500|$|Many {{people in}} the {{community}} wrote of how much they enjoyed their experience and, in particular, the light-hearted atmosphere. One participant, a man named John Codman, joined the community at the age of 27 in 1843. He wrote, [...] "It was for the meanest a life above humdrum, and for the greatest something far, infinitely far beyond. They looked into the gates of life and saw beyond charming visions, and hopes springing up for all". The idealism of the community sometimes was not met, however. Because the community was officially secular, a variety of religions were represented, though not always amicably. When Isaac Hecker and, later, Sophia Ripley converted to Catholicism, a Protestant Brook Farmer complained, [...] "We are beginning to see wooden crosses around and pictures of saints... and <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> rosaries are rattling under aprons." ...|$|E
500|$|As he {{was writing}} the film in 1985, John Hughes kept track of his {{progress}} in a spiral-bound logbook. He noted that the basic storyline was developed on February 25. It was successfully pitched the following day to Paramount Studios chief Ned Tanen. Tanen was intrigued by the concept, but wary that the Writers Guild of America was hours away from picketing the studio. Hughes wrote the screenplay {{in less than a}} week. Editor Paul Hirsch explained that Hughes had a trance-like concentration to his script-writing process, working for hours on end, and would later shoot the film on essentially what was his first draft of the script. [...] "The first cut of Ferris Bueller's Day Off ended up at two hours, 45 minutes. The shortening of the script had to come in the cutting room", said Hirsch. [...] "Having the story episodic and taking place in one day...meant the characters were wearing the same clothes. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> Hughes writes his scripts with few, if any costume changes just so he can have that kind of freedom in the editing." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{the editor}} of Personal Computer World was on holiday in May 1981, his colleagues publicised the magazine's review of the ZX81 with a cover showing a {{chimpanzee}} with the machine above the strapline [...] "Editor benchtests the ZX81". (The chimp returned in later issues to [...] "benchtest" [...] all of Sinclair's subsequent computers.) The review, which was written by PCW staffer Dave Tebbutt, acknowledged that the machine had significant shortcomings but nonetheless represented [...] "absolutely amazing value for money". He described the ZX81 as [...] "a lovely product which will have enormous appeal to people wanting {{to find out more}} about computers, but without it costing them an arm and a leg" [...] and concluded: [...] "If you know nothing about computers and you want to enjoy finding out about them, then this machine offers a value for money way of doing just that. Children will love the ZX81, there can be no question about that, and <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> more than a few people who are already familiar with computers will buy one, just to have a bit of fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That you've been fooling me!" [...] {{the girl}} interrupted, {{a faint smile}} {{at the corners of}} her lips. [...] "Do you know, {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>that</b> you weren't in earnest! And then one day I saw your wife--and I wasn't sure!" ...|$|R

6000|$|Then he {{took this}} {{opportunity}} of consulting {{me on the}} chances for Frith, telling of the original offer, and the quiet constancy of his friend, and asking whether I thought Emily would relent.

500|$|The Daily Telegraphs Gerard O'Donovan {{agreed that}} [...] "June Brown, as Dot, was mesmerising", but was {{similarly}} {{critical of the}} episode as a whole, concluding: [...] "Overall [...] the feeling couldn’t be avoided that in the greater scheme of things this was a fuss over nothing. Had it been a swan song, {{it would have been}} a worthy one. But doubtless Dot will be out and about again tonight, fag in hand, quoting from the Good Book. Enjoyable as this Albert Square indulgence was, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> most fans will be hoping this one-hander remains a one-off." [...] Leigh Holmwood for The Guardian suggested that viewers may have agreed with O'Donovan's assessment, highlighting the fact that the episode received only 8.7million viewers, compared to 9.4million watching EastEnders the previous week. A 2003 episode centred around Dot also resulted in a notable ratings slump. The New Year episode, which detailed her childhood evacuation to the countryside, received just 8.1million viewers, compared with 12.2m the previous evening and 16m on Christmas Day. Prior to this, however, a 2002 two-hander episode featuring just Dot and Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) was watched by 11.5million viewers, with an almost 60% share of viewers in the timeslot.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian Gareth McLean {{described}} the episode as a [...] "bold move" [...] {{on the part}} of the EastEnders producers in deviating from the serial's usual format, and found it to be [...] "compelling and brave", but [...] "not as convincing as it should be". The Daily Telegraph Gerard O'Donovan felt that Brown gave a [...] "mesmerising" [...] performance, but was critical of the episode as a whole, concluding: [...] "Overall [...] the feeling couldn't be avoided that in the greater scheme of things this was a fuss over nothing.

O'Donovan compared the episode to Krapp's Last Tape, saying [...] "it must be said there were quite a few moments of positively (or perhaps that should be negatively) Beckettian bleakness here as Dot recalled, in painfully vivid detail, how time and time again 'life took away everything I ever cared about' and 'all that I ever 'ad, I lorst'." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard Fogle {{responded to}} the {{critical}} attack on Keats's emphasis on rhyme and language put forth by Garrod, Gerard, and others in 1953. His argument was similar to Brooks: that the poem was thematically coherent {{and that there is}} a poet within the poem that is different from Keats the writer of the poem. As such, Keats consciously chose the shift in the themes of the poem and the contrasts within the poem represent the pain felt when comparing the real world to an ideal world found within the imagination. Fogle also responded directly to the claims made by Leavis: [...] "I find Mr. Leavis too austere, but he points out a quality which Keats plainly sought for. His profusion and prodigality is, however, modified by a principle of sobriety." [...] It is possible that Fogle's statements were a defense of Romanticism as a group that was both respectable in terms of thought and poetic ability. Wasserman, following in 1953, claimed that [...] "Of all Keats' poems, it is probably the 'Ode to a Nightingale' that has most tormented the critic [...] in any reading of the 'Ode to a Nightingale' the turmoil will not down. Forces contend wildly within the poem, not only without resolution, but without possibility of resolution; and the reader comes away from his experience with the sense that he has been in 'a wild Abyss'". He then explained, [...] "It is this turbulence, <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> <b>that</b> has led Allen Tate to believe the ode 'at least tries to say everything that poetry can say.' But I propose it is the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' that succeeds in saying what poetry can say, and that the other ode attempts to say all that the poet can." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Clarke's {{authorized}} biography, Neil McAleer writes that: [...] "many {{readers and}} critics still consider Childhood's End Arthur C. Clarke's best novel." [...] But Clarke {{did not use}} ESP in any of his later stories, saying [...] "I've {{always been interested in}} ESP and, of course, Childhood's End was about that. But I've grown disillusioned, partly because after all this time they're still arguing about whether these things happen. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> telepathy does happen." ...|$|E

He primarily writes on economic subjects, generally advocating a free market approach to capitalism. Sowell opposes the Federal Reserve, arguing that it has been unsuccessful in preventing economic depressions and limiting inflation.|$|E
2500|$|The god {{of death}} {{is an element of}} several {{religions}} in Westeros and Essos, on grounds from Martin that [...] "worship {{of death is}} an interesting basis for religion because after all, death is the one universal. It doesn't seem to matter what gods you pray to. We all die in the real world and in fantasy worlds. So if there was one culture where you did not die, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> God would become very popular. They will promise us eternal life, but whatever". He also stated the belief [...] "that {{the world we live in}} was created by the evil god [...] kind of persuasive" [...] when [...] "you look at the world, particularly the Medieval world".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} on National Public Radio (NPR), author Michael Lind said, [...] "Before {{the rise of a}} self-conscious intelligentsia, most educated people [...] as well as the unlettered majority [...] spent most of their time in the countryside or, if they lived in cities, were a few blocks away from farmland or wilderness... At the risk of sounding countercultural, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>that</b> thinkers who live in sealed, air-conditioned boxes and work by artificial light (I am one) are as unnatural as apes in cages at zoos. Naturalists like Eiseley in that sense are the most normal human beings to be found among intellectuals, because they {{spend a lot of time}} outdoors and know the names of the plants and animals they see... For all of his scientific erudition, Eiseley has a poetic, even cinematic, imagination." ...|$|E
