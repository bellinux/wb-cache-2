In distinction to Mackay, they argued that a federal Europe should not contain communist states. In 1949, he became {{the chair of the}} <b>European</b> <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Union.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{search for}} a symbol began in 1950 when a {{committee}} {{was set up in}} order to look into the question of a European flag. There were numerous proposals but a clear theme for stars and circles emerged. Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi proposed that they adopt the flag of his International Paneuropean Union, which was a blue field, with a red cross inside an orange circle at the centre, which he had himself recently adopted for the <b>European</b> <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Union.</b> Due to the cross symbolism, this was rejected by Turkey (a member of the Council of Europe since 1949). Kalergi then suggested adding a crescent to the cross design, to overcome the Muslim objections. Another organisation's flag was the European Movement, which had a large green E on a white background. A further design was one based on the Olympic rings: eight silver rings on a blue background. It was rejected due to the rings' similarity with [...] "dial", [...] "chain" [...] and [...] "zeros". One proposal had a large yellow star on a blue background, but it was rejected due to its similarity with the so-called Burnet flag and the flag of the Belgian Congo.|$|E

5000|$|The {{end of the}} World War II inaugurated {{a revival}} of pan-European hopes. In the winter of 1945, Harry S. Truman read {{an article in the}} December issue of Collier's {{magazine}} that Coudenhove-Kalergi posted about the integration of Europe. His article impressed Truman, and it was adopted to the United States' official policy. Winston Churchill's celebrated speech of 19 September 1946 to the Academic Youth in Zurich commended [...] "the exertions of the Pan-European Union which owes so much to Count Coudenhove-Kalergi and which commanded the services of the famous French patriot and statesman Aristide Briand." [...] In November 1946 and the spring of 1947, Coudenhove-Kalergi circulated an enquiry addressed to members of European parliaments. This enquiry resulted in the founding of the <b>European</b> <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> (EPU), a nominally private organization that held its preliminary conference on 4-5 July at Gstaad, Switzerland, and followed it with its first full conference from 8 to 12 September. Speaking at the first EPU conference, Coudenhove-Kalergi argued that the constitution of a wide market with a stable currency was the vehicle for Europe to reconstruct its potential and take the place it deserves within the concert of Nations. On less guarded occasions he was heard to advocate a revival of Charlemagne's empire. In 1950 he received the first annual Karlspreis (Charlemagne Award), given by the German city of Aachen to people who contributed to the European idea and European peace. In Japan, a politician Ichirō Hatoyama was influenced by Coudenhove-Kalergi's fraternity in his book The Totalitarian State Against Man. It was translated into Japanese by Hatoyama and published in 1952. Coudenhove-Kalergi was appointed the honorary chairman of the fraternal youth association that Hatoyama, with the influence of his book, had established in 1953.|$|E
40|$|Subject of {{a recent}} revival of interest, {{for a long period}} Ferruccio Parri {{has been one of the}} great men “forgotten” by historians. Commander of the Resistance, he is a staunch {{supporter}} of its European identity. In June 1945 he became President of the Council for a semester, remaining a member of parliament until 1953. He can rightly be considered also one of the most important players in the beginning of the process of continental integration. The article focuses on this specific aspect. After the launch of the Marshall Plan and the start of the process of European unification, Parri is at the forefront in the fight for the European Federation. He becomes part of the <b>European</b> <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Union</b> (UPE), of the Union Européenne des fédéralistes (UEF) and of the European Federalist Movement (MFE). After the elections of 1948, he becomes president of the Italian Parliamentary Group for the European Union in the Senate. Since that moment, Parri is increasingly involved in the struggle for federalism, embracing the constituent method. In July 1949 he is appointed a member of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe. His action in favour of the Constituent Assembly is especially lively after the presentation of the Pleven Plan. Because of is disagreement on the EDC, he comes out from the MFE in 1954, but he is continuing even after to deal with European integration...|$|E

Tento spolek se v meziválečném období pokoušel sjednotit Evropu, organizoval kongresy, vydával manifesty a memoranda, aby získal vrcholné politiky. Své pobočky měl v řadě tehdejších státech, včetně Československa, doba však pro tyto aktivity nebyla zralá. Do roku 1972 se práce zabývá také životním dílem hraběte Richarda Coudenhove-Kalergiho, který byl zakladatelem a tvůrcem Panevropské unie. Hnutí pokračovalo v exilu v New Yorku a pak došlo po roce 1945 nejprve ve formě Evropské parlamentní unie a pak opět ve formě Panevropské unie k obnově činnosti ve válkou zničené Evropě. Po roce 1972 převzal předsednictví skomírající Panevropské unie Otto Habsburg, který jej spolu s dalšími spolupracovníky zreorganizoval a oživil. This diploma work {{deals with}} The Paneuropean Union {{which is a}} {{supranational}} organisation whose goal is the unity of Europe. The Paneuropean Union was founded by Count Richard Coudenhove-Kalergi, who wrote prophetic document "Paneuropa" (1923), in which he presented {{an alternative to the}} pessimistic view of civilisation: a united Europe. The best men of his time followed him. Aristide Briand was among his closest collaborators. But National Socialist barbarism smashed these hopeful beginnings. Coudenhove fled from Hitler's dictatorship. Between 1940 - 1945 Coudenhove lived in USA, where he wanted to get acclaim of US-government. After the war he flunder the <b>European</b> <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>Union,</b> which goal lay in assembling and organizing the parliamentarians from european countries. In 1954 / 55 Coudenhove succesfully refounded the Paneuropean Union, which propagated the politoval union of the west european countries. After Coudenhove's death in 1973 these achievements seemed endangered. Europe was split, unification stagnated and Communism gained ground while the West dreamt of detente. It was then that the newly elected president, Otto von Habsburg, decided to turn the Paneuropean Union into a broad, popular movement. Nowadays, the Paneuropean Movement has branches in most European countries and plays an active role for Europe's unity. Katedra historických vě...|$|E

The paper acknowledges six ‘known unknowns’ that could have considerable consequences {{for the evolution of}} the Union’s party-political system. The paper then considers some basic questions about the model the Union has cumulatively chosen before considering some of the ‘discontents’ of some party-political systems and their potential relevance to the EU’s emerging system. The paper briefly considers whether the early evolution of the US party political system can shed any light on possible developments and identifies similarities. It concludes by pointing out that the existence of a parliamentary party-political system, with electoral linkage between the executive and the legislature, is a necessary but far from sufficient condition for viable governance – and opposition...|$|R
