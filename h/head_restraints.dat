25|$|Due to low public {{awareness}} of the consequence of incorrect positioning of <b>head</b> <b>restraints,</b> some passenger vehicle manufactures have designed and implemented a range of devices into their models to protect their occupants.|$|E
25|$|October 1980 - Chevette ES two-door saloon and three-door {{hatchback}} introduced {{with similar}} specification to the E models but even {{lower level of}} trim with vinyl trim plus carpets. E revised with plaid cloth upholstery; L with radio and quartz clock; GL with front <b>head</b> <b>restraints,</b> radio and (on hatchback) load area cover.|$|E
25|$|Models {{equipped}} with an automatic transmission now had an overdrive cancel button that allowed the driver to lock the transmission {{in the first three}} gears to provide power for passing and climbing grades. The pattern of the cloth on the seats was also redesigned, and the <b>head</b> <b>restraints</b> earned an acceptable rating from the IIHS for whiplash protection.|$|E
2500|$|Automatically {{adjusting}} <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> — {{refers to}} a <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> that automatically adjusts {{the position of the}} <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> when the seat position is adjusted.|$|R
2500|$|Integrated <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> or fixed <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> — {{refers to}} a <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> formed by {{the upper part of}} the seat back, or a <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> that is not height {{adjustable}} and cannot be detached from the seat or the vehicle structure except by the use of tools or following the partial or total removal of the seat furnishing".|$|R

25|$|In Romania, it was {{initially}} available with four trim levels: Ambiance, Preference, Laureate and Ambition. The basic level Ambiance featured driver airbag, body-colored bumpers, wheel trims and central locking. The second level Preference added passenger airbag, power steering, electric front windows, radio, two rear seat <b>head</b> <b>restraints</b> and remote locking. The third level Laureate added front fog lights, air conditioning, trip computer, electric mirrors, three rear seat <b>head</b> <b>restraints</b> and a multi-adjustable driver seat. The top level Ambition also had ABS, electric rear windows, CD player and alloy wheels. The 1.6-litre gasoline engine was available {{only on the}} Preference level and above. In September 2005, the 1.5-litre diesel engine was introduced, initially not being available on the Ambition level. In January 2006, a new intermediate trim level called Laureate Plus was added, which {{in addition to the}} Laureate level featured ABS, electric rear windows and CD player. Also, the diesel engine became available for the Ambition level.|$|E

25|$|On 21 July 2000, an 11-year-old boy {{died after}} {{falling out of}} a ride vehicle on the Space Invader roller coaster. Reports say {{that he may have}} panicked on the dark ride and unfastened his seatbelt. As a result of the accident, the ride was closed and {{carriages}} were re-fitted with over the <b>head</b> <b>restraints.</b> The ride opened after a short hiatus as Space Invader 2.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to a properly adjusted <b>head</b> <b>restraint,</b> research suggests {{that there may be}} an increased risk of neck injuries if the <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> is incorrectly positioned. More studies by manufacturers and automobile safety organizations are currently undergoing to examine the best ways to reduce head and torso injuries during a rear-end impact with different geometries of the <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> and seat-back systems.|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} {{mechanics}} of the neck during rear end impact, in this paper an existing global human body model and an existing detailed submodel of the neck were combined into a new model. The combined model is validated with responses of volunteers and post mortem human subjects (PMHSs) subjected to rear end impacts of resp 5 g and 12 g. The volunteers (n= 7, 7 tests) were seated on a standard car seat with <b>head</b> <b>restraint,</b> while the PMHSs (n= 3, 6 tests) were placed on a rigid seat without <b>head</b> <b>restraint.</b> The model shows good agreement with the PMHS responses when muscle tensile stiffness is increased towards published PMHS tissue properties. For the volunteer simulations, initial seating posture and <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> position were found to strongly influence the model response. More leaning forward (increasing of horizontal distance <b>head</b> <b>head</b> <b>restraint)</b> results in larger T 1 and head motions. A correct vertical position of the <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> (top of <b>head</b> in one line with top of <b>head</b> <b>restraint)</b> reduces the <b>head</b> extension angle. The model has the potential to study injury mechanism...|$|R
25|$|June 1980 - Limited edition Chevette Sun Hatch three-door {{hatchback}} model introduced, {{based on}} the Chevette L model, but additionally fitted with sunroof, tinted glass, sports wheels, metallic paint, bodyside mouldings, side direction indicator flashers, front <b>head</b> <b>restraints,</b> clock and push-button radio. The Sun Hatch could be had with either manual or automatic transmission, with the manual version priced at £3,954 and the automatic version priced at £4,167.|$|E
25|$|Available {{only as a}} two-door hardtop, the {{interior}} came in standard gray charcoal vinyl upholstered reclining seats with a headliner embossed with small squares. The front seats reclined, and the newly safety mandated <b>head</b> <b>restraints</b> were upholstered in red, white, and blue stripes. The SC/Rambler included a standard 90-degree wide arc scale Sun tachometer. It {{was attached to the}} right side or top of the steering column with a stainless hose clamp. The only factory option was an AM radio.|$|E
25|$|In most {{passenger}} vehicles where manually adjustable <b>head</b> <b>restraints</b> are fitted, proper use requires sufficient knowledge and awareness by occupants. When driving, {{the height of}} the head restraint is critical in influencing injury risk. A restraint should be at least as high as the head's center of gravity, or about 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) below the top of the head. The backset, or distance behind the head, should be as small as possible. Backsets of more than 10 centimeters (about 4 inches) have been associated with increased symptoms of neck injury in crashes.|$|E
2500|$|Adjustable <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> — {{refers to}} a <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> {{that is capable of}} being {{positioned}} to fit the morphology of the seated occupant. The device may permit horizontal displacement, known as tilt adjustment, and/or vertical displacement, known as height adjustment.|$|R
25|$|A {{major issue}} in {{whiplash}} prevention {{is the lack of}} proper adjustment of the seat safety system by both drivers and passengers. Studies have shown that a well designed and adjusted <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> could prevent potentially injurious head-neck kinematics in rear-end collisions by limiting the differential movement of the head and torso. The primary function of a <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> is to minimize the relative rearward movement {{of the head and neck}} during rear impact. During a rear-end collision, the presence of an effective <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> behind the occupant’s head can limit the differential movement of the head and torso. A properly placed <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> where one can sufficiently protect his/her head lower the chances of head injury by up to 35% during a rear-end collision.|$|R
40|$|Although {{typically}} {{classified as}} AIS 1, whiplash injuries continue {{to represent a}} substantial societal problem with associated costs estimated at over $ 5 billion annually in the US. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of seatback and <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> design parameters on occupant response in rear impact. Rear impact sled tests were conducted using the Hybrid III mid-sized male (50 M) dummy seated in a modified production seat, which allowed for the adjustment of recliner stiffness, seatback cushion stiffness, and <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> height. Instrumentation provided measurements of neck forces and moments, head motion relative to the torso, seatback rotation, and head contact. An on-board digital video camera recorded dummy kinematics. Results from this study indicate that the risk of whiplash injury is not simply related to <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> position, but is dependent on a combination of factors related to both <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> and seatback design...|$|R
25|$|Clinical use of fMRI still {{lags behind}} {{research}} use. Patients with brain pathologies {{are more difficult}} to scan with fMRI than are young healthy volunteers, the typical research-subject population. Tumors and lesions can change the blood flow in ways not related to neural activity, masking the neural HDR. Drugs such as antihistamines and even caffeine can affect HDR. Some patients may be suffering from disorders such as compulsive lying, which makes certain studies impossible. It is harder for those with clinical problems to stay still for long. Using <b>head</b> <b>restraints</b> or bite bars may injure epileptics who have a seizure inside the scanner; bite bars may also discomfort those with dental prostheses.|$|E
25|$|One notable {{change was}} the front {{subframe}} assembly — {{as compared with}} Ford, Chrysler and AMC, in whose cars the entire front suspension was integrated with the bodyshell, a separate subframe housing the powertrain and front suspension (similar to the front part of the frame of GM's full-size, full-framed vehicles) replaced the earlier style. Although the front subframe design was unique for the Nova, the Camaro introduced a year earlier {{was the first to}} incorporate such a design; the redesigned Nova was pushed a year ahead to 1968 instead of 1969. The sales brochure claimed 15 powertrain choices for coupes and a dozen for sedans. Options included power brakes and steering, Four-Season or Comfort-Car air conditioning, rear shoulder belts, and <b>head</b> <b>restraints.</b> There were a few Chevrolet Novas built with the 194 ci (3.1 L), the same motor that had been used in the previous generations of the Chevy II. Sales of the 1968 Chevy Nova fell by half. In 1969 Chevrolet dropped the Chevy II portion of its compact car's name; it was now known simply as the Chevrolet Nova.|$|E
25|$|In {{the safety}} aspect the Statesman comes with Bosch Electronic Stability Control, {{traction}} control, ABS brakes, EBD, BAS and a tyre pressure monitoring system as standard Front, side and curtain airbags come as standard {{which is another}} incentive to improve the Caprice's safety equipment, this {{also contributed to the}} fact that the Caprice’s safety rating surpass that off its main rival, the LTD. Development commenced with the largest virtual crash modelling program Holden has ever undertaken. Emphasis was placed on considering the range of impact scenarios that occur in real world accident situations and differing occupant criteria. Safety technologies were benchmarked along with the world’s leading luxury brands and major engineering programs delivered a stiffer body structure and vastly increased usage of advanced strength steels. Multiple load corridor strategies for frontal, side and rear impacts improve passenger compartment integrity. They are complemented by an improved multi-point airbag sensing system and an adaptive restraint system which includes dual stage front airbags, thorax side impact airbags, curtain airbags and front seat active <b>head</b> <b>restraints</b> as standard equipment. Structurally optimised crush zones absorb crash energy and other occupant protection features include a steering column ride-down mechanism and breakaway brake pedal.|$|E

40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in International Journal of Crashworthiness on 03 Dec 2015, available online: [URL]. This paper presents design of a concept for an integrated <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> and car seat system to mitigate whiplash in rear-end vehicle collisions. The main emphasis is on a concept, which combines a reactive <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> with a reactive seat. The chosen concept is developed {{in the form of}} mechanical linkages using linkage analysis software, SAM 6. 1. A human model positioned in a ‘good’ driving posture is used to show how the <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> and seat would operate using a typical crash pulse used for dynamic sled testing of automotive seats. The <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> system is capable of translating into an optimal position of 40 mm forwards and 60 mm upwards in 12 ms, before whiplash-induced injuries start to take place. The reactive seat is also capable of reclining 15 degrees. The combination of reducing the backset and reclining the seat to reduce the relative motion between the head and torso has the potential to reduce the whiplash-effect-related injuries in rear-end collisions...|$|R
2500|$|The {{focus of}} {{preventive}} measures {{to date has}} been on the design of car seats, primarily through the introduction of <b>head</b> <b>restraints,</b> often called headrests. This approach is potentially problematic given the underlying assumption that purely mechanical factors cause whiplash injuries — an unproven theory. So far the injury reducing effects of <b>head</b> <b>restraints</b> appears to have been low, approximately 5–10%, because car seats have become stiffer in order to increase crashworthiness [...] of cars in high-speed rear-end collisions which in turn could increase the risk of whiplash injury in low-speed rear impact collisions. Improvements in the geometry of car seats through better design and energy absorption could offer additional benefits. Active devices move the body in a crash in order to shift the loads on the car seat.|$|E

ResultsThe mean level of <b>head</b> <b>restraint</b> movement was 0. 130 mm, with a significantly higher level at the beginning, probably owing to the accelerating arm. Mean movement of patients was 1. 135 mm and 1. 119 mm in the open-eyed and blindfolded groups, respectively. Patient movement was also significantly higher {{at the beginning of}} the scan, when noise and vibrations are likely to surprise the patient. ConclusionsPatient instruction and a dry-run scan should be done by clinicians.
