However, this arrangement may not work if an opposition MP vacates <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her seat and no by-election is called, because of the dearth of opposition MPs in Parliament. Therefore, the voters in the opposition ward will be denied of representation until the next general election.|$|E

6000|$|But He is the same. He {{is there}} all the time. All things are His work. In all things we may see Him, if our souls have eyes.

5|$|As {{with all}} Pokémon {{role-playing}} games released for handheld consoles, FireRed and LeafGreen are in third-person, overhead perspective. The main screen is an overworld, {{in which the}} player navigates the protagonist. Here a menu interface may be accessed, in which the player may configure <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her Pokémon, items, and gameplay settings. When the player encounters a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer, the screen switches to a turn-based battle screen that displays the player's Pokémon and the engaged Pokémon. During a battle, the player may select a move for <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her Pokémon to perform, use an item, switch <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her active Pokémon, or attempt to flee. All Pokémon have hit points (HP); when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and can no longer battle until it is revived. Once an enemy Pokémon faints, all of the player's Pokémon involved in the battle receive {{a certain amount of}} experience points (EXP). After accumulating enough EXP, a Pokémon may level up.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} each song, {{a result}} screen is {{displayed}} to player, and <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her performance is rated with a letter grade, a numerical score, and a percentage that represents <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her accuracy. The player is awarded a number of fans and in-game money for <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her performance. The number of fans determine the idols' ranking, and as the player's idols increase in ranking, more items become available for purchase. These items can then be used to customize the game's appearance or adjust gameplay elements, such as straightening the Melody Lines' shapes or causing the player to gain fans quicker. Finishing a song also earns the player Memories with the idols who perform the song, which can be used in the Star of Festa game mode.|$|E
