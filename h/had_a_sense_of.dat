5|$|Beatrice was the shyest {{of all of}} Queen Victoria's children. However, {{because she}} {{accompanied}} Queen Victoria almost wherever she went, she became among the best known. Despite her shyness, she was an able actress and dancer {{as well as a}} keen artist and photographer. She was devoted to her children and was concerned when they misbehaved at school. To those who enjoyed her friendship, she was loyal and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humour, and as a public figure she was driven by a strong sense of duty. She was Patron of the Isle of Wight Branch of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution from 1920 until her death. Music, a passion that was shared by her mother and the Prince Consort, was something in which Beatrice excelled, and she played the piano to professional standards. Like her mother, she was a devout Christian, fascinated by theology until her death. With her calm temperament and personal warmth, the princess won wide approval.|$|E

40|$|What {{is it like}} to be a {{clinical}} educator? How do clinical educators experience and describe their continuing journey of becoming {{a clinical}} educator? Within the model developed in this research, dimensions of being a clinical educator were identified. These dimensions include (<b>a)</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> self (and the impact of bringing self into the clinical educator’s role), (b) <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> relationship with others (and the place of this ‘‘interactive self’’ as a central feature of clinical education), (c) <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> being <b>a</b> clinical educator (and how this understanding relates to the previous two dimensions), (d) <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> agency (which is vital to the performance of many clinical education roles), (e) seeking dynamic self-congruence, and (e) growth as a clinical educator. This paper presents an overview of the model, discusses its strengths and limitations as a representation of speech pathology clinical educators’ experiences, and briefly considers its value for professional development...|$|R

25|$|Initially, Phil was calmer than Grant {{but both}} {{brothers}} <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> physical danger, displaying stereotypical masculinity, thuggish behaviour and {{a tendency to}} resolve problems through violence. Phil was originally depicted as the thinker and the more streetwise of the pair, often bailing his more spontaneous brother out of trouble, although later plotlines drove the character down a darker, more destructive route. Phil can be very violent, but unlike Grant, he occasionally showed restraint when dealing with various enemies encountered – exacting revenge over time, using mind games or getting others to do his dirty work, amongst other things.|$|E
25|$|Of the two {{brothers}} Grant was the more volatile, but both <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> physical danger about them, and both displayed stereotypical masculinity, thuggish behaviour and a tendency to resolve problems through violence. Grant was originally depicted as the more spontaneous of the Mitchell double-act, suffering {{from a lack of}} self-control, often incapable of restraining himself and requiring his elder brother to do it for him. Despite the brothers' closeness, rivalry between them was sometimes evident. It was later revealed that Grant's terrible temper was due to post-traumatic stress disorder, caused by nightmares and scarring memories of his combat in the Falklands War.|$|E

When he was ill, he treated himself (to the approval of physicians). He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humour, though serious subjects he treated seriously.

Indeed, his heart was on his Great Society agenda, and he even felt that his political opponents favored greater intervention in Vietnam in order to divert attention and resources away from his War on Poverty. The situation on the ground was aggravated in the fall by additional Viet Minh attacks on US ships in the Tonkin Gulf, as well as an attack on Bien Hoa Air Base in South Vietnam. Johnson decided against retaliatory action at the time after consultation with the Joint Chiefs and also after public pollster Lou Harris confirmed that his decision would not detrimentally affect him at the polls. By the end of 1964, there were approximately 23,000 military personnel in South Vietnam. U.S. casualties for 1964 totaled 1,278.|$|E

I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny.

25|$|Our oldest {{citation}} for otium is this {{chorus of}} soldiers, singing about idleness on campaign, {{in an otherwise}} lost Latin tragedy by Ennius. Andre shows in these lines that Ennius is showing the soldiers in the field would rather go home tending to their own affairs (otium) than to be idle doing nothing. Its military origin meant to stop fighting in battle and laying down of the weapons - a time for peace. Even though originally otium was a military concept in early Roman culture of laying down one's weapons, it later became an elite prestigious time for caring for onesself. The ancient Romans <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> obligatory work ethics in their culture and considered the idle-leisure definition of otium as a waste of time. Historians of ancient Roman considered otium a time of laborious leisure of much personal duties instead of public duties. Author Almasi shows that historians Jean-Marie Andre and Brian Vickers point out the only legitimate form of otium was transpired with intellectual activity. Otium was thought of by the wise elite as being free from work and other obligations (negotium) and leisure time spent on productive activities, however a time {{that should not be}} wasted as was thought the non-elite did with their leisure time.|$|E
