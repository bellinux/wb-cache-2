5|$|Legislation {{passed through}} the Parliament Act, {{without the consent of}} the Lords, is still {{considered}} primary legislation. The importance of this was highlighted in Jackson v Attorney General, in which the lawfulness of the Parliament Act 1949 was questioned. The challenge asserted that the 1949 Parliament Act was delegated rather than primary legislation, and that the 1911 Parliament Act had <b>delegated</b> <b>power</b> to the Commons. If this were the case, then the House of Commons could not empower itself through the 1949 Parliament Act without direct permission from the House of Lords. Since it was passed under the 1911 Act, the 1949 Act had never received the required consent of the Lords. However, the Judicial Committee of the House of Lords found that the 1949 Act had been lawfully enacted. The 1911 Act, it concluded, was not primarily about empowering the Commons, but rather had the purpose of restricting the ability of the Lords to reject legislation. This ruling also appears to mean that efforts to abolish the House of Lords (a major constitutional change) by using the Act could be successful, although the issue was not directly addressed in the ruling.|$|E

40|$|In {{representative}} democracies, citizens <b>delegate</b> <b>powers.</b> Not surprisingly, citizens react angrily {{when the}} <b>delegated</b> <b>powers</b> are misused (i. e., used {{so as to}} decrease social welfare). Perhaps more puzzlingly, citizens sometimes repeatedly <b>delegate</b> the same <b>power</b> (e. g., surveillance of citizens, conscription), and then repeatedly react with anger to its misuse. To study this phenomenon, we model a stylized public that repeatedly adjusts the set of <b>powers</b> it <b>delegates</b> to politicians. The public obtains new information each period, forecasts rationally (but not perfectly) the benefits and costs of delegation, and infers the likelihood with which a court will correct politicians' misuses of <b>delegated</b> <b>powers.</b> We use the model to explore the history of eminent domain in the United States [...] a history characterized by periodic public backlash. The model and historical discussion illuminate the nature of public responses to judicial rulings [...] explaining why the public may react by adjusting the scope of <b>delegated</b> <b>powers,</b> even if a ruling merely upholds a well-established precedent.

25|$|The Mamluk sultan was the {{ultimate}} authority, while he <b>delegated</b> <b>power</b> to provincial governors known as nuwwab as-saltana (deputy sultans, sing. na'ib as-saltana). Generally, the vice-regent of Egypt was the most senior na'ib, followed by the governor of Damascus, then Aleppo, then the governors of al-Karak, Safad, Tripoli, Homs and Hama. In Hama, the Mamluks had permitted the Ayyubids to continue to govern until 1341 (its popular governor in 1320, Abu'l Fida, was granted the title sultan by Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad), but otherwise the nuwwab of the provinces were Mamluk emirs.|$|E

500|$|In modern {{scholarship}} {{outside the}} legal arena the Report is mostly studied for its discussion of states' rights {{with regard to}} federalism and republicanism. According to Kevin Gutzman, the Report, together with the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, forms a foundation for the [...] "radical southern states' rights tradition." [...] However, Madison rebuffed charges that his writings supported the constitutional interpretation advanced by pro-nullification Southerners. The Report of 1800, Madison argued, did not say the government was a compact of the individual states, as the pro-nullification elements suggested. Rather the Report of 1800 described a compact of [...] "the people {{in each of the}} States, acting in their highest sovereign capacity." [...] The state governments themselves, no less than the federal judiciary, possess only <b>delegated</b> <b>power</b> and therefore cannot decide questions of fundamental importance. Madison thought the Resolutions and Report were consistent with this principle while the Ordinance of Nullification was not.|$|E

2500|$|First, the {{majority}} of the Court, whose opinion was authored by Justice Louise Charron, denied that the case should be decided under the rules of administrative law, which required simple reasonableness. [...] The majority believed this would limit the rights under the Charter. [...] As Charron wrote, [...] "The rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Canadian Charter establish a minimum constitutional protection that {{must be taken into account}} by the legislature and by every person or body subject to the Canadian Charter." [...] The rule against weapons under administrative law was not the subject of this case. [...] The real focus was how in practise the law banned the kirpan. [...] The Court went on to note that the council of commissioners, which had banned the kirpan, was bound by the Charter. [...] This was because the council was created by a statute and thus received its powers from a legislature. [...] While the concurring justices Deschamps and Abella believed section 1 of the Charter could only be used on unconstitutional written laws, Charron wrote that section 1 can also be applied to <b>delegated</b> <b>power.</b> [...] If the power is used according to the law, it is [...] "prescribed by law" [...] as required by section 1; Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada (Minister of Justice) (2000) was an example of a case in which <b>delegated</b> <b>power</b> was not prescribed by law. [...] Since the council acted according to the law, the Court could now look at the freedom of religion issue.|$|E

60|$|Sect. 141. Fourthly, The {{legislative}} cannot {{transfer the}} power of making laws to any other hands: for it being but a <b>delegated</b> <b>power</b> from the people, they who have it cannot pass it over to others.

The power of the legislative, being derived from the people by a positive voluntary grant and institution, can be no other than what that positive grant conveyed, which being only to make laws, and not to make legislators, the legislative can have no power to transfer their authority of making laws, and place it in other hands.|$|E

60|$|While, however, {{it is thus}} {{distinctly}} {{understood that}} the power of the teacher is supreme, that all the power rests in him, and that he alone is responsible for its exercise, there ought, to be a very free and continual delegation of power to the pupils.

They should be interested as much as possible in the affairs of the school, and led to take an active part in carrying them forward; though they should, all the time, distinctly understand, that it is only <b>delegated</b> <b>power</b> which they exercise, and that the teacher can, at any time, revoke what he has granted, and alter or annul at pleasure, any of their decisions.

Trust is reposed in them, which may be greater or less, as they are able to bear. All the good effects of reposing trust and confidence, and committing the management of important business to the pupils will be secured, without the dangers which would result from the entire surrender of the management of the institution into their hands.|$|E

6000|$|The next plea {{urged by}} Mr. Hastings is conveniency. [...] "It was convenient," [...] he says, [...] "for {{me to do}} this." [...] I answer, No person acting with <b>{{delegate}}d</b> <b>power</b> can delegate that power to another. Delegatus non potest delegare is a maxim of law. Much less has he a right to supersede the law, and the principle of his own delegation and appointment, upon any idea of convenience. But what was the conveniency? There was no one professed object connected with Mr. Hastings's going up to Benares which might not {{as well have been}} attained in Calcutta. The only difference would have been, that in the latter case he must have entered some part of his proceedings upon the Consultations, whether he wished it or not. If he had a mind to negotiate with the Vizier, he had a resident at his court, and the Vizier had a resident in Calcutta. The most solemn treaties had often been made without any Governor-General carrying up a delegation of civil and military power. If it had been his object to break treaties, he might have broken them at Calcutta, as he broke the treaty of Chunar. Is there an article in that treaty that he might not as well have made at Calcutta? Is there an article that he broke (for he broke them all) that he could not have broken at Calcutta? So that, whether pledging or breaking the faith of the Company, he might have done both or either without ever stirring from the Presidency.|$|E
