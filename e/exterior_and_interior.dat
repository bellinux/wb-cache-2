5|$|Both the <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> <b>interior</b> of Rode Hall {{have been}} altered {{multiples}} times, including work by Thomas Farnolls Pritchard and Lewis Wyatt, {{resulting in an}} irregular and complex layout. The house has large collections of period paintings, furniture, and porcelain by Chelsea, Bow and Royal Worcester.|$|E
5|$|In late August, {{the crew}} {{relocated}} to Allendale, New Jersey. A suburban house on East Orchard Street {{was used to}} film <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> <b>interior</b> scenes set in the Sabich family home. The house's cellar was used to film a scene involving Rusty and his wife. The cast and crew then returned to Kaufman Astoria Studios to film the trial scenes. Principal photography concluded on October 24, 1989.|$|E
5|$|Standing {{on top of}} a late Roman church, the cathedral, reconstructed in the 1970s and 1980s, {{follows a}} cross-domed plan with a bell tower and a triple apse. Richly {{decorated}} on both the <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> <b>interior,</b> its internal walls now feature modern frescoes, the presence of which has meant that it has not been reconsecrated. Though not active as a Christian place of worship, it has been open for visitors since 1985.|$|E

5|$|The {{gatehouse}} is a two-storied, 17th century {{building with}} exposed timber and plasterwork, constructed in a distinctively local Shropshire style. It features elaborate wooden carvings on the <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> <b>interior</b> doorways, including angels, the biblical characters of Adam, Eve and the serpent from the Garden of Eden, {{as well as}} dragons and other nude figures. It was designed as essentially an ornamental building, with little defensive value.|$|E
5|$|The hotel {{served as}} the primary {{backdrop}} for the TV show Vega$ which aired on ABC from 1978 to 1981. The 1980s Aaron Spelling soap opera Dynasty included footage of the hotel, {{and use of the}} Presidential Suite. The hit 1980s NBC TV series Remington Steele filmed its 60th Las Vegas-set episode at the inn, where both the <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> <b>interior</b> are shown regularly throughout the episode.|$|E
5|$|The trains {{were built}} in Goldau, Switzerland. CWA Constructions {{designed}} both the <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> <b>interior</b> of the trains {{to make them look}} as faithful as possible to the Hogwarts Express seen in the Harry Potter film franchise. They are based on the steam locomotive GWR 4900 Class 5972 Olton Hall (as 5972 Hogwarts Castle) and were built from aluminum and glass-reinforced plastics. Afterwards, an artificial weathering process was applied to give the appearance of a historic train.|$|E

5|$|Shooting {{took place}} almost entirely in London. The {{directors}} somewhat followed the filming style of Bharat Nalluri, {{the director of}} the first two episodes of series one and two, who used London and the River Thames as characters in themselves. The <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> <b>interior</b> of Freemasons' Hall continued to be a stand-in for Thames House, the headquarters of MI5. However, the Grid, the base of operations of Section D, was a set constructed at the fifth floor in another building. Danny's apartment was also filmed in the same building. Another constructed set was the back of mobile surveillance vans, which was housed near the Grid set.|$|E
5|$|The Blackstone Hotel was {{designed}} by architect Benjamin Marshall, of Marshall and Fox, in 1909. Sources vary as to the precise style in which Marshall designed the building. According to the Landmarks Division of the City of Chicago's Department of Planning and Development, the hotel's <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> <b>interior</b> are considered {{an excellent example of}} neoclassical Beaux-Arts architecture; the nomination form for the building's listing on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places classifies the structure as distinctly Second Empire. However, the two styles are related, and the Blackstone Hotel demonstrates elements from both schools. The design was influenced by Marshall's trip to Paris, after which he completed the hotel.|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} underwent {{an extensive}} restoration project between 1998 and 2001. During {{this time it}} was completely covered in scaffolding designed by the American architect Michael Graves (who was also responsible for the interior changes). The project included cleaning, repairing and repointing the monument's <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> <b>interior</b> stonework. The stone in publicly accessible interior spaces was encased in glass to prevent vandalism, while new windows with narrower frames were installed (to increase the viewing space). New exhibits celebrating the life of George Washington, and the monument's place in history, were also added.|$|E

5|$|The role of Baroque {{sculpture}} {{was usually}} subordinate, as decorative elements of <b>exteriors</b> <b>and</b> <b>interiors,</b> <b>and</b> on tombstones. A famous {{exception is the}} Sigismund's Column of Sigismund III Vasa (1644) in front of Warsaw's Royal Castle.|$|R
5|$|Access to {{the central}} island {{occurred}} over a drawbridge, through a pair of gatehouses on the eastern side. Caerphilly Castle's Inner East Gatehouse, based on the gatehouse built at Tonbridge in the 1250s, reinforced a trend in gatehouse design across England and Wales. Sometimes termed a keep-gatehouse, the fortification had both <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> <b>interior</b> defences, enabling it to be defended even if {{the perimeter of the}} castle was breached. Two huge towers flanked the gatehouse on either side of an entrance that was protected by portcullises and murder-holes. The substantial size of the gatehouse allowed it to be used for accommodation as well as defence and it was comfortably equipped on a grand scale, probably {{for the use of the}} castle constable and his family. Another pair of gatehouses protected the west side.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} at Dwarka, both {{on shore}} and offshore in the Arabian Sea, {{have been performed}} by the Archaeological Survey of India. The first investigations carried out on land in 1963 revealed many artifacts. Excavations done at two sites on the seaward side of Dwarka brought to light submerged settlements, a large stone-built jetty, and triangular stone anchors with three holes. The settlements are {{in the form of}} <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> <b>interior</b> walls, and fort bastions. From the typological classification of the anchors it is inferred that Dwarka had flourished as a port during the period of the Middle kingdoms of India. Coastal erosion was probably the cause of the destruction of what was an ancient port.|$|E
5|$|Beato's {{photographs}} of the Second Opium War {{are the first to}} document a military campaign as it unfolded, doing so through a sequence of dated and related images. His {{photographs of}} the Taku Forts represent this approach on a reduced scale, forming a narrative recreation of the battle. The sequence of images shows the approach to the forts, the effects of bombardments on the exterior walls and fortifications, and finally the devastation within the forts, including the bodies of dead Chinese soldiers. The photographs were not taken in this order, as the photographs of dead Chinese had to be taken first—before the bodies were removed; only then was Beato free to take the other views of the <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> <b>interior</b> of the forts.|$|E
50|$|Richard Fleischer's Mr. Majestyk (1974), {{starring}} Charles Bronson, used several <b>exteriors</b> <b>and</b> <b>interiors</b> in La Junta, {{including the}} hospital and police station, {{as well as the}} downtown gun battle and parts of the car chase.|$|R

5|$|Nothing survives of the {{original}} buildings, La Oriole and the smaller St Martin's Hall in the south-east; both were demolished before the quadrangle {{was built in the}} artisan mannerist style during the 17th century. The south and west ranges and the gate tower were built around 1620 to 1622; the north and east ranges and the chapel buildings date from 1637 to 1642. The façade of the east range forms a classical E shape comprising the college chapel, hall and undercroft. The <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> <b>interior</b> of the ranges are topped by an alternating pattern of decorative gables. The gate house has a Perpendicular portal and canted Gothic oriel windows, with fan vaulting in the entrance. The room above has a particularly fine plaster ceiling and chimney piece of stucco caryatids and panelling interlaced with studded bands sprouting into large flowers.|$|E
5|$|Now that Vietnam was unified, {{the center}} of gravity of the country moved further south, {{following}} centuries of southerly migration and conquest, so Gia Long moved the seat of government from Hanoi to Huế. Gia Long rebuilt the old citadel of Phú Xuân into a fortress stronghold. The structure was a square shape of 2.5km per side. A 9m rampart was encased with masonry and protected by protruding bastions, each defended by 36 guns. The <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> <b>interior</b> were flanked and reinforced by a series of moats. The citadel's defenders included an 800-strong elephant troop. The new palace structure, protocol and court dress were all taken directly from Qing Dynasty styles, and his palace and fortress was intended to be a smaller copy of the Chinese Forbidden City in the 1800s.|$|E
5|$|Production {{returned}} to Manhattan to film the opening credits sequence. Filming {{then moved to}} Harlem, New York, where a hospice was used to film a scene involving the character Spider Simpson (Charles Gordone), {{and many of the}} hospice's elderly residents acted as extras for the scene. On April 17, 1986, the production team moved to Staten Island to film <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> <b>interior</b> scenes involving the character Dr. Fowler (Michael Higgins). Filming then moved to Hoboken, New Jersey, which doubled for a scene set in a New Orleans train station. From April 28 to April 29, the production team {{returned to}} Harlem, where Parker filmed Rourke and De Niro's scene in a Harlem mission. The two actors next filmed a scene at Lanza's, an Italian restaurant located on the Lower East Side.|$|E
25|$|Two quarter-scale <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> two quarter-scale <b>interior</b> {{models were}} made in February 1999 with Volker Leutz’s <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> Christoph Machinek’s <b>interior</b> {{proposals}} selected for development into full-size development models.|$|R

He has {{designed}} <b>exteriors</b> <b>and</b> <b>interiors</b> for yachts of sizes from 50' to 400' and provides related design services.|$|R
50|$|Plou's {{design for}} a French Neoclassical <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> <b>interiors</b> {{in the style of}} Louis XV {{resulted}} from the day's architectural tastes among Argentine high society and government planners, alike. The façade was crowned with sculptures by local artist Nicolás Gulli, representing allegories of music and dance.|$|R
5|$|Resistance: Fall of Man is {{a science}} fiction first-person shooter video game. The game is set in an {{alternate}} history 1951, and focuses on human resistance forces attempting to drive a mysterious alien-like invasion out of Great Britain. It was released as a PlayStation 3 launch title in Europe on 23 March 2007. Resistance features recreations of English landmarks throughout the game, including at one point a gun fight between player protagonist Nathan Hale and the alien species around the <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> <b>interior</b> of Manchester Cathedral. The cathedral is a medieval church on Victoria Street in central Manchester and is {{the seat of the}} Bishop of Manchester. Built in the 15th century, it has been extensively refaced, restored and extended during the Victorian period, and then again following severe bomb damage in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The church {{featured}} ample <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> <b>interior</b> decoration. While the facades were {{decorated with}} arches and ceramic tiles, the interior floor mosaics {{were made of}} white, yellow and pink marble as well as semi-precious gemstones like sapphire and porphyry. The interior walls were covered with frescoes and mosaics. However, none of the interior decoration has survived. During the church's 20th-century reconstruction, its interior was repainted by artist Teofan Sokerov, who depicted important moments of medieval Bulgarian history in a modernist style. Due to these murals, the church has never been reconsecrated and remains inactive. The facade of the cathedral also includes a stone with a donor's inscription of a Bulgarian ruler, which ended up {{as part of the}} building material.|$|E
5|$|The {{team that}} should {{determine}} the necessary engineering work {{and assess the}} car's financial viability {{was put in place}} during mid-1989, working from the TWR workshops. Mike Moreton headed the team, joining TWR to run the XJ220 project. Moreton came from Ford Motorsports where he led the team responsible for the Ford Sierra RS500 Cosworth, and was a project manager for the Ford RS200 Group B rally car program. Richard Owen was appointed chief designer, and the remainder of the team was made up of Jaguar and TWR staff, including Pete Dodd, {{the only member of the}} group of twelve responsible for the XJ220 concept. The <b>exterior</b> <b>and</b> <b>interior</b> designers who had worked on the XJ220 prototype, Keith Helfet and Nick Hull, rejoined the project when it became clear that more design work would be needed.|$|E
