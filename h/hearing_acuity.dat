Methods: A multistage stratified random cluster sampling method was used to sample 2476 individuals with a response rate of 81 % in the Qingdao region. Pair-wise correlation analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between sensorimotor function and blood glucose. To display the association between the health domains and their determinants, t tests and one-way analysis of variance were used. Results: Near vision acuity showed a negative correlation with blood glucose (p <  0. 05), but other health variables had no significant correlation with blood glucose.

40|$|Falls {{are one of}} {{the most}} common {{problems}} that threaten the independence of older individuals. They usually occur when impairments in multiple domains compromise the compensatory ability of the individual, as is the case for many geriatric syndromes. A number of the physical conditions and environmental situations predispose to falls. The medical risk factors of falls are reviewed. Falls in older individuals are rarely due to a single cause. Mechanisms that maintain postural stability are altered with aging (balance, gait speed, cardiovascular function). Female gender, past history of a fall, cognitive impairment, lower extremity weakness, balance problems, psychotropic drug use, arthritis, history of stroke, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and anemia represent the most frequent causes of risk of falls. Physical examination should focus upon the above mentioned risk factors and also on the presence of orthostatic hypotension, visual <b>acuity,</b> <b>hearing</b> assessment, examination of the extremities for deformities or neuropathies, and carotid sinus hypersensitivity which contributes to falls in people with unexplained falls. In conclusion, assessment of older individual at risk of falls or who fall present medical specificities. However, these latter specificities should be included in a comprehensive assessment which focus on intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Interventional strategies including comprehensive and interdisciplinary assessment lead to effective prevention. English AbstractJournal ArticleReviewinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Self-rated {{health is}} {{routinely}} used {{in research and}} practise among general populations. Older people, however, seem to change their health perceptions. To accurately understand these changed perceptions we therefore need to study the correlates of older people's self-ratings. We examined self-rated, nurse-rated and physician-rated health's association with common disabilities in older people (the geriatric giants), mortality hazard and life satisfaction. For this, we used an age-representative population of 501 participant aged 85 from a middle-sized city in the Netherlands: the Leiden 85 -plus Study. Participants with severe cognitive dysfunction were excluded. Participants themselves provided health ratings, {{as well as a}} visiting physician and a research nurse. Visual <b>acuity,</b> <b>hearing</b> loss, mobility, stability, urinal and faecal incontinence, cognitive function and mood (depressive symptoms) were included as geriatric giants. Participants provided a score for life satisfaction and were followed up for vital status. Concordance of self-rated health with physician-rated (k =. 3 [. 0]) and nurse-rated health (k =. 2 [. 0]) was low. All three ratings were associated with the geriatric giants except for hearing loss (all p < 0. 001). Associations were equal in strength, except for depressive symptoms, which showed a stronger association with self-rated health (. 8 [. 1] versus. 4 [. 1]). Self-rated health predicted mortality less well than the other ratings. Self-rated health related stronger to life satisfaction than physician's and nurse's ratings. We conclude that professionals' health ratings are more reflective of physical health whereas self-rated health reflects more the older person's mental health, but all three health ratings are useful in research...|$|R

50|$|In both {{of these}} situations, it is {{possible}} to improve hearing by removing the stapes bone and replacing it with a micro prosthesis - a stapedectomy, or creating a small hole in the fixed stapes footplace and inserting a tiny, piston-like prosthesis - a stapedotomy.

50|$|Many of the African {{contributions}} {{were ignored}} about its origin, taken by Greek cosmologists, {{and used by}} the early pioneers of psychology, but even after that the African Americans received more racism instead of credibility. Most of this took place after the Civil war, when Jim Crow emerged. Even the Rat was White, a book published in 1976, encouraged African American psychology. A second edition of this book was published in 1996. The author Robert V. Guthrie explains the different ways that white American scientists contributed to racists criticism against African Americans. Many of these explained that African Americans are inferior to white Americans. Many scientists did intelligence testing on African Americans and white Americans which resulted in African Americans being the inferior race. Charles Darwin’s natural selection theory was published in 1859. The assumption of this theory was that only the strongest and intelligent individuals or organisms could survive. In the 20th century many studies were done to compare the differences in African Americans and white Americans. The results mainly showed that African Americans were inferior. Sir Francis Galton’s studies in the 19th century attributed the racial inferiority of African Americans' intelligence to inheritance. Through his theory he predicted that if intelligence is inherited, then {{it would not be}} expected for lower intelligence to be improved through ability. Galton thought that through selective mating, the improvement of race could be done controlling the inferior intelligence genetically. The results showed that African Americans and other minorities were considered to be those who were unfit and inferior and white Americans as superior. Anthropology studies were done in 18th and 19th century that compared African Americans' and White Americans' physical characteristics. Qualities such as skin color, hair texture, posture, face structure, and skull structure were assessed in favor of white Americans. William McDougall's theory of instinct created many racist concepts about African Americans. One of his studies characterized African Americans as easygoing, happy, and lazy. Another study was done that tested <b>hearing,</b> vision, taste, <b>acuity,</b> pain, and motor speed of African Americans. The result was that minorities, such as, African American were inferior to white Americans.|$|R

The study is conducted as a collaboration between the University of Newcastle and the Hunter New England Area Health Service. The first phase of this study sampled 3253 people representing a response rate of 44. 5 %. A follow up survey of the entire cohort is currently being completed (Jan-June 2011). Description of the data Blood collection samples The blood samples include plasma, serum, whole blood, and DNA that have been stored at - 80 degrees Celsius, as well as whole cells cryopreserved in DMSO in liquid nitrogen (- 196 C) for future use. All the blood samples are stored in 1 -ml aliquots to minimize freeze-thaw cycles, which may adversely impact on analyte integrity. One of the more unique samples is whole blood that has been cryopreserved with dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) in liquid nitrogen to obtain whole lymphocytes for future cell immortalization (through Epstein-Barr virus transformation) and cytogenetic studies. These samples also allow for assaying biomarkers of genetic damage, in which toxins have affected DNA integrity. These include single- or double-stranded DNA breaks detected using the COMET assay, micronuclei, sister chromatid exchanges and cytogenetic abnormalities, all of which require whole viable cells, not just isolated DNA.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if a relationship exists between creative-adventure playground participation and the development of visual-motor integration in 3 - 4 1 / 2 -year-old children. More specifically, this study attempted to answer the following questions: (1) Is there a relationship between creative-adventure playground participation and the development of visual-motor integration in 3 - 4 1 / 2 -year-old boys? (2) Is there a relationship between creative-adventure playground participation and the development of visual-motor integration in 3 - 4 1 / 2 -year-old girls?This study used the Pretest-Posttest Control Group Design. Thirty-two preschool children, ages 3 - 4 1 / 2 were screened for <b>hearing</b> and vision <b>acuity.</b> The subjects were then pretested on the Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration and randomly assigned to the experimental or control group within one of four preschool classes held in the Early Childhood Education Research Laboratory of Northern Illinois University. The children attended a two hour session twice per week for six weeks. A minimum of 30 minutes was designated for play experiences during each session. The experimental group participated on the creative-adventure playground, while the control group participated in free play activities in the research laboratory. The teachers for each group were randomly assigned, given specific instructions for their play environments and monitored by the investigator during the study. At the end of six weeks the subjects were posttested on the Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration. Differences between pre- and posttest scores were tested utilizing a correlated (dependent) t-test. Analysis of covariance was used to test posttest differences between the groups after adjusting for initial pretest scores. The null hypotheses were rejected at the. 05 level of significance. Based on the analysis of the data, the following conclusion was drawn: Participation on the creative-adventure playground improved the visual-motor integration scores in 3 - 4 1 / 2 -year-old boys and girls. The research findings of this study suggest the following implications for preschool programs: (1) A creative-adventure playground can provide an additional outdoor teaching resource center for the classroom. (2) Creative-adventure playground experiences are beneficial to both boys and girls and should be included in curriculum planning. (3) If a creative-adventure playground is unavailable, similar experiences should be provided for children, particularly, girls. Recommendations for further study include: (1) Replication of this study utilizing a larger population sample in another preschool situation for a longer time period. (2) A longitudinal study of preschool children who have participated on a creative-adventure playground to investigate effects on their academic achievement in elementary school. (3) A study to determine if a relationship exists between creative-adventure playground participation and the development of language, self-concept and socialization in preschool children. (4) A longitudinal study of preschool girls who have participated on a creative-adventure playground and those who have not to determine effects on their academic achievement in elementary school.

50|$|Glossotherium {{had large}} ear ossicles, {{similar to those}} in elephants, which imply the loss of <b>hearing</b> <b>acuity</b> of higher frequencies, further {{implying}} an advantage for sensing low frequency sounds, infrasound, or bone-conducting seismic waves.

Sloths may have used low frequency sounds for communication in mating calls or other social interactions, or for long-range sound sensing as in predator-prey interactions or weather forecasting. Another possible explanation for hearing in low frequencies may be due to fossorial habits: low hearing frequencies coupled with a short interaural distance suggest that Glossotherium probably had very poor sound localization. This indicates evidence of an underground lifestyle since loss of high frequency hearing is common to fossorial mammals. Glossotherium’s huge nostrils were likely effective for sound emission, with expanded nares possibly related to emission of low frequency sounds up to 600 Hz.|$|E
