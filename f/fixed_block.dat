5|$|The entire metro {{system and}} the trains are run by a fully {{automated}} computer system, located at the Control and Maintenance Center south of Vestamager Station. The automatic train control (ATC) consists of three subsystems: automatic train protection (ATP), automatic train operation (ATO) and automatic train supervisory (ATS). The ATP is responsible for keeping the trains' speed, ensuring that doors are closed before departure and switches are correctly set. The system uses <b>fixed</b> <b>block</b> signaling, except around stations, where moving block signaling is used.|$|E

50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of having <b>fixed</b> <b>blocks</b> {{is that the}} faster trains are allowed to run, the longer the stopping distance, and therefore the longer the blocks need to be, thus decreasing the line's capacity.

The subsystems consist of Automatic train protection (ATP) to govern train speed, Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) to track and schedule trains and a Relay interlocking system that prevents incorrect signal and track points to be set.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} {{modernization}} of the New York City Subway, the MTA has plans to upgrade much of the system with communications-based train control (CBTC) technology, which will control the speed and starting and stopping of subway trains. The CBTC system is mostly automated and uses a moving block system – which reduces headways between trains, increases train frequencies and capacities, and relays the trains' positions to a control room – rather than a <b>fixed</b> <b>block</b> system. This will require new rolling stock to be built for the subway system, as only newer trains can use CBTC systems.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we generalize N-fold integer {{programs}} and two-stage integer programs with N scenarios to N-fold 4 -block decomposable integer programs. We show that for <b>fixed</b> <b>blocks</b> but variable N, these integer programs are polynomial-time solvable for any linear objective. Moreover, {{we present a}} polynomial-time computable optimality certificate for the case of <b>fixed</b> <b>blocks,</b> variable N and any convex separable objective function. We conclude with two sample applications, stochastic integer programs with second-order dominance constraints and stochastic integer multi-commodity flows, which (for <b>fixed</b> <b>blocks)</b> can be solved in polynomial time {{in the number of}} scenarios and commodities and in the binary encoding length of the input data. In the proof of our main theorem we combine several non-trivial constructions from the theory of Graver bases. We are confident that our approach paves the way for further extensions...|$|R

40|$|A {{recently}} developed method of constructing protograph-based low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes provides for low iterative decoding thresholds and minimum distances proportional to block sizes, {{and can be}} used for various code rates. A code constructed by this method can have either <b>fixed</b> input <b>block</b> size or <b>fixed</b> output <b>block</b> size and, in either case, provides rate compatibility. The method comprises two submethods: one for <b>fixed</b> input <b>block</b> size and one for <b>fixed</b> output <b>block</b> size. The first mentioned submethod is useful for applications in which there are requirements for rate-compatible codes that have <b>fixed</b> input <b>block</b> sizes. These are codes in which only the numbers of parity bits are allowed to vary. The fixed-output-blocksize submethod is useful for applications in which framing constraints are imposed on the physical layers of affected communication systems.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} Satisfiability Modulo Theory based {{formulation}} for floorplanning in VLSI circuits. The proposed approach allows {{a number of}} <b>fixed</b> <b>blocks</b> to be placed within a layout region without overlapping {{and at the same}} time minimizing the area of the layout region. The proposed approach is extended to allow a number of <b>fixed</b> <b>blocks</b> with ability to rotate and flexible blocks (with variable width and height) to be placed within a layout without overlap. Our target in all cases is reduction in area occupied on a chip which is of vital importance in obtaining a good circuit design. Satisfiability Modulo Theory combines the problem of Boolean satisfiability with domains such as convex optimization. Satisfiability Modulo Theory provides a richer modeling language than is possible with pure Boolean SAT formulas. We have conducted our experiments on MCNC and GSRC benchmark circuits to calculate the total area occupied, amount of deadspace and the total CPU time consumed while placing the blocks without overlapping. The results obtained shows clearly that the amount of dead space or wasted space is reduced if rotation is applied to the blocks. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
