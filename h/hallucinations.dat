5|$|Auditory <b>hallucinations</b> {{are typical}} of psychoses: third-person <b>hallucinations</b> (i.e. voices talking about the patient) and hearing one's {{thoughts}} spoken aloud (gedankenlautwerden or écho de la pensée) are among the Schneiderian first rank symptoms indicative of schizophrenia, whereas second-person <b>hallucinations</b> (voices talking to the patient) threatening or insulting or telling them to commit suicide, may be a feature of psychotic depression or schizophrenia. Visual <b>hallucinations</b> are generally suggestive of organic conditions such as epilepsy, drug intoxication or drug withdrawal. Many of the visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs are more correctly described as visual illusions or visual pseudohallucinations, as they are distortions of sensory experiences, and are not experienced as existing in objective reality. Auditory pseudohallucinations are suggestive of dissociative disorders. Déjà vu, derealization and depersonalization are associated with temporal lobe epilepsy and dissociative disorders.|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that musical <b>hallucination</b> have a {{significant}} impact on patients' lives, they have received very little attention of experts. Some researchers agree on a combination of peripheral and central dysfunctions as the mechanism that causes <b>hallucination.</b> The most accepted physiopathology of musical <b>hallucination</b> associated to hearing loss (caused by cochlear lesion, cochlear nerve lesion or by interruption of mesencephalon or pontine auditory information) is the disinhibition of auditory memory circuits due to sensory deprivation. Concerning the cortical area involved in musical <b>hallucination,</b> there is evidence that the excitatory mechanism of the superior temporal gyrus, as in epilepsies, is responsible for musical <b>hallucination.</b> In musical release <b>hallucination</b> there is also activation of the auditory association cortex. Finally, considering the laterality, functional studies with musical perception and imagery in normal individuals showed that songs with words cause bilateral temporal activation and melodies activate only the right lobe. The effect of hearing aids on the improvement of musical <b>hallucination</b> as a result of the hearing loss improvement is well documented. It happens because auditory <b>hallucination</b> may be influenced by the external acoustical environment. Neuroleptics, antidepressants and anticonvulsants have been used in the treatment of musical <b>hallucination.</b> Cases of improvement with the administration of carbamazepine, meclobemide and donepezil were reported, but the results obtained were not consistent...|$|R
5|$|Schizophrenia {{is often}} {{described}} in terms of positive and negative (or deficit) symptoms. Positive symptoms are those that most individuals do not normally experience, but are present in people with schizophrenia. They can include delusions, disordered thoughts and speech, and tactile, auditory, visual, olfactory and gustatory <b>hallucinations,</b> typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis. <b>Hallucinations</b> are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme. Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication.|$|E
5|$|A {{more general}} medical and {{neurological}} examination {{may be needed}} to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, AIDS dementia complex, epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy Body dementia may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. It may be necessary to rule out a delirium, which can be distinguished by visual <b>hallucinations,</b> acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication. In children <b>hallucinations</b> must be separated from typical childhood fantasies.|$|E

40|$|The {{study is}} talking about <b>Hallucination.</b> The problem {{of this study is}} how <b>hallucination</b> {{reflected}} in Henry James’ The Turn of The Screw. It uses psychological and sociological perspectives. Psychologically, the objectives of this study are presenting an analysis of the symptoms, the causes and effects of <b>hallucination</b> experienced by the governess. Besides, it also analyzes the sociological factor that describes the relationship of Henry James’ The Turn of The Screw and social reality of English society at the end of 19 th century; and to reveal the author’s criticism at Henry James’ The Turn of The Screw. The object of this study is Henry James’ The Turn of The Screw novel. This research employs a qualitative approach that has two types of data sources, namely primary and secondary data. The primary data source is the novel and the secondary data is other material related to the study. Both data are collected through library research and analyzed by descriptive analysis. The findings of the research based on the psychological analysis reveal the symptoms of <b>hallucination</b> experienced by the governess which are feeling anxious, seeing the apparitions, hearing some voices, feeling afraid, day dreaming, screaming, and talking to oneself, and the types of <b>hallucination</b> experienced by the governess which are auditory <b>hallucination,</b> visual <b>hallucination,</b> olfactory <b>hallucination</b> and mood-incongruent <b>hallucination.</b> The causes of <b>hallucination</b> experienced are her poverty, her low education, her too much responsibility, her repressed and unfulfilled sexual desire. And the effects of <b>hallucination</b> found are the governess insanity and over protective to the children. In addition, based on the sociological analysis, it is apparent that there is a strong relation between this novel and the social reality in England in the 19 th century. And, the author criticizes about unequal social status and gender. The findings of this research are expected to give a wider horizon about <b>hallucination,</b> and also can add and enrich the knowledge about literature product.

40|$|On November 27 in 1943, Anne {{told her}} diary her <b>hallucination</b> in which Hanneli Pick-Goslar, {{one of her}} best friends, stood silently, staring at Anne.

In the paper, we discuss some reasons why Anne saw Hanneli in her <b>hallucination</b> from the viewpoint of dreamer-centered dream analysis in order to reveal Anne's circumstances and psychological states at that time. As a result, it can be concluded that the <b>hallucination</b> arose from (a) Anne's guilty for Hanneli herself; (b) her lost friendship with Hanneli; (c) her fear about arrestment by Nazis; (d) her failure of eyesight; and (e) her loss of her important fountain pen as well as her guilty for Jewish people who were sent to concentration camps...|$|R

40|$|Face <b>hallucination</b> {{is one of}} learning-based super {{resolution}} techniques, {{which is}} focused on resolution enhancement of facial images. Though face <b>hallucination</b> is a powerful and useful technique, some detailed high-frequency components cannot be recovered. It also needs accurate alignment between training samples. In this paper, we propose a high-frequency compensation framework based on residual images for face <b>hallucination</b> method {{in order to improve}} the reconstruction performance. The basic idea of proposed framework is to reconstruct or estimate a residual image, which can be used to compensate the high-frequency components of the reconstructed high-resolution image. Three approaches based on our proposed framework are proposed. We also propose a patch-based alignment-free face <b>hallucination.</b> In the patch-based face <b>hallucination,</b> we first segment facial images into overlapping patches and construct training patch pairs. For an input low-resolution (LR) image, the overlapping patches are also used to obtain the corresponding high-resolution (HR) patches by face <b>hallucination.</b> The whole HR image can then be reconstructed by combining all of the HR patches. Experimental results show that the high-resolution images obtained using our proposed approaches can improve the quality of those obtained by conventional face <b>hallucination</b> method even if the training data set is unaligned...|$|R
40|$|In The Turn of The Screw, Henry James {{presents}} the governess {{as the central}} character pictured {{as a young woman}} who is able to have <b>hallucination</b> of ghosts. Due to this fact, this thesis is a study of the causes that make the governess hallucinate about ghosts and the effects of her <b>hallucination</b> itself. Therefore, this thesis intends to prove that there are some causes that make the governess able to have <b>hallucination</b> and that the <b>hallucination</b> finally brings negative effects to herself and moreover brings sufferingand damage to the innocent children. In doing the analysis, the writer does a literary approach by applying theory of characterization and theory of setting. Furthermore, {{in order to make the}} analysis on the causes of the governess' <b>hallucination,</b> the thesis writer uses two related meanings, those are neuroticism and <b>hallucination</b> to explain the governess' uncommon nature. The analysis is done first by studying the governess own character which is weak, since she owns the nature of being easily carried away and over imaginative and these are furthermore supported by her neurotic tendency. This nature owned by the governess is concluded as the cause of the governess' <b>hallucination.</b> The thesis writer also analyzes other important causes of the governess' <b>hallucination,</b> which are the master whom she loves and also the mysterious, gloomy scenes in Bay. Both also have great influences that cause the governess' <b>hallucination.</b> Secondly, the analysis is also done by discussing the effects of the governess' <b>hallucination</b> on the governess herself and on the children. Through the analysis, the thesis writer finds out that the governess' <b>hallucination</b> which is later transformed and used in her heroic idea of self sacrifice to be the savior for the children in order to get sympathy from her master ironically brings negative effects and horror, not only to the innocent children, but also {{presents the}} governess a complex disaster and horrifying failure to herself...|$|R

However, adding a benzodiazepine to treat psychosis, instead of an antipsychotic, may become a valid alternative according to the model of amphetamine-induced psychosis. Psychotic symptoms are associated with factors such as higher doses of bupropion, a history of bipolar disorder or psychosis, concomitant medications, for example, lithium or benzodiazepines, old age, or substance abuse.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is organized}} around extending and defending Grice’s {{account of the}} seeing relation. On {{the basis of the}} Argument from Veridical <b>Hallucination</b> and the Argument from Competing Objects, Grice argues that seeing is constituted by causal relations between experiences and objects. It is clearly insufficient for seeing a thing merely that one’s experience causally depend on it. What is required is the right kind of dependence. In {{the first half of the}} dissertation, I advocate a counterfactual account of the requisite dependence. My account survives the host of counterexamples that have been given against counterfactual theories. In particular, I advocate a process-relative counterfactual account – were the seen thing different (in appropriate ways) and were the process actually eventuating in your experience operational, then your experience would represent those differences. The second half of the dissertation is devoted to defending the possibility of veridical <b>hallucination.</b> If veridical <b>hallucination</b> is impossible, then the Argument from Veridical <b>Hallucination</b> cannot be accepted. There are two threats to the possibility of veridical <b>hallucination.</b> First, it has been argued that an acceptance of the possibility of veridical <b>hallucination</b> has unacceptable entailments. I defend the possibility of veridical <b>hallucination</b> by proposing that phenomenally identical experiences possess different contents in different perceptual situations. If this is true, then one can affirm that veridical <b>hallucination</b> is possible, while avoiding unacceptable entailments. Second, John Searle proposes that experiences have contents that represent the obtaining of perception-grounding relations. On Searle’s account, veridical <b>hallucination</b> is impossible. My treatment of Searle has two parts. In the first, I examine the connections between content and phenomenology. They are not sufficient to defeat Searle’s account; but neither do they lend it strength. Thus, they do not provide sufficient warrant for Searle’s account to reject the possibility of veridical <b>hallucination.</b> In the second, I examine a case Searle must classify as reference-failing mental anaphora. In such cases, Searle is stuck with the kind of conclusion the rejection of which motivates his anti-externalist descriptivism. Thus, again, we have no reason to prefer Searle’s account of the contents of visual experiences over the possibility of veridical <b>hallucination...</b>|$|R
