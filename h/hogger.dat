30|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of {{attention}} to devise power consumption models for routers and switch fabrics. The power consumption of the integrated Alpha 21364 router and the IBM InfiniBand 8 -port 12 X switch is modelled in[22] illustrating that buffers are the largest power <b>hoggers</b> in routers. A crossbar switch, if present, consumes less but still significant power, and arbiter power is negligible under high network load. It is shown, that also the router micro-architecture has a huge impact on router power consumption.[23] suggest a framework to estimate the power consumption on switch fabrics in network routers. They state that the power consumption on switch fabrics is mainly determined by the internal node switches, the internal buffer queues and the interconnect wires.[24] present a power and area model according to network-on-chip architectures. They suggest ORION 2.0 that uses a set of architectural power models for network routers to perform early-stage network-on-chip power estimation.|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{networks}} {{are among the}} major energy <b>hoggers</b> of communication networks, and {{their contributions to the}} global energy consumption increase rapidly due to the surges of data traffic. With the development of green energy technologies, base stations (BSs) can be powered by green energy {{in order to reduce the}} on-grid energy consumption, and subsequently reduce the carbon footprints. However, equipping a BS with a green energy system incurs additional capital expenditure (CAPEX) that is determined by the size of the green energy generator, the battery capacity, and other installation expenses. In this paper, we introduce and investigate the green energy provisioning (GEP) problem which aims to minimize the CAPEX of deploying green energy systems in BSs while satisfying the QoS requirements of cellular networks. The GEP problem is challenging because it involves the optimization over multiple time slots and across multiple BSs. We decompose the GEP problem into the weighted energy minimization problem and the green energy system sizing problem, and propose a green energy provisioning solution consisting of the provision cost aware traffic load balancing algorithm and the binary energy system sizing algorithm to solve the sub-problems and subsequently solve the GEP problem. We validate the performance and the viability of the proposed green energy provisioning solution through extensive simulations, which also conform to our analytically results...|$|R

50|$|In 2010, the British label Chandos {{released}} a CD {{that includes a}} 17-minute concert suite from Hangover Square, assembled by Stephen <b>Hogger.</b> The film's musical tour-de-force is a sonata movement for piano and orchestra in the Lisztian style (where the scherzo and adagio movements, which are typical as succeeding movements in a concerto, are compressed and presented {{in place of a}} central development). Slightly revised by the composer in 1973 for Charles Gerhardt's RCA film music series and retitled Concerto Macabre, it has been recorded by RCA, Naïve, Koch and Naxos, in addition to the recording paired with Hogger's suite.

40|$|Abstract Background Pharmacokinetic properties, dosing regimen, and potency at {{the site}} of action are among the factors that {{influence}} activity of a corticosteroid. The potency of a corticosteroid {{at the site}} of action is determined significantly by its affinity to the glucocorticoid receptor. Recent literature on topical corticosteroids reveals an increasing emphasis on comparative relative receptor affinity values as a key method of differentiating among various corticosteroid compounds, particularly with regard to clinical efficacy. Methods A response was formulated to: Valotis A, <b>Högger</b> P: Human receptor kinetics and lung tissue retention of the enhanced-affinity glucocorticoid fluticasone furoate. Respir Res 2007, 8 : 54. Results Relative receptor binding affinities, while often showing significant variability across different laboratories, are a valid parameter when a comparison of the pharmacological activity of various glucocorticoids {{at the site of}} action is desired. Unfortunately within this context, scientific literature including the article from Valotis and <b>Högger,</b> confuse differences in potency (concentration or dose necessary to achieve a certain effect) with differences in efficacy (a quantitative difference in the overall maximum effect, even if all the receptors are occupied). All glucocorticoids will show the same efficacy as long as the selected dose will occupy the same number of receptors. Conclusion While relative receptor affinities are useful for comparing in vitro potencies of corticosteroids, these data are not representative of physiologic conditions and should not be used as a basis for comparing the presumed effectiveness of compounds in a clinical situation. </p...|$|E
40|$|We formalise the {{derivation}} {{of logic}} programs from their specifications by deductive synthesis, and introduce {{the notion of}} uniform equivalence between logical systems. This enables us to present an incompleteness result for deductive synthesis of logic programs from first-order logic specifications. 1 Introduction Logic program synthesis was studied by some researchers {{in the early days}} of logic programming. Most notable among these are Clark, Hansson, <b>Hogger,</b> and Tarnlund. Automated (or semi-automated) synthesis, however, has only received serious attention much more recently. A preliminary survey, in the form of a catalogue, of logic program synthesis methods can be found in [8]. The goal of logic program synthesis is to systematically derive logic programs from their specifications. For example, in the proofs-as-programs approach, the specification takes the form of a theorem (or more accurately a conjecture) stating the existence of the required output for any legitimate input; a [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper, we {{described}} {{a method for}} synthesising recursive logic procedures from their first-order logic specifications. The method is practical because it is strictly top-down and has been implemented {{as part of a}} user-guided synthesis system in Prolog. We have used the system to synthesise procedures {{for a wide variety of}} algorithms, including a large family of recursive sorting procedures. In this paper we describe the synthesis of this family of procedures. 1 Introduction Although much theoretical work has been done in logic program derivation, most notably by Clark, Hansson, <b>Hogger,</b> and Tarnlund [3, 4, 7, 9], there has been relatively little work in mechanising logic program synthesis. The recent work of Sato and Tamaki [15, 14] is one of the few examples. Independently, we worked on designing and implementing a practical system for mechanised program synthesis. The result is a method for top-down synthesis of recursive logic procedures from their specifications in fir [...] ...|$|E
