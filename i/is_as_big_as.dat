500|$|Writing about cricket in Trinidad, {{historian}} C. L. R. James {{noted that}} Dewhurst always kept wicket [...] "excellently", but that many Trinidadians considered Piggott a better wicket-keeper {{who was only}} left out because he was black and Dewhurst was white. James recalled that people were astonished when Piggott was not chosen to tour England in 1923. But he suggests {{it was not a}} surprise as without Dewhurst's selection, among the Trinidad representatives on the West Indian team, {{there would have been no}} players from the Queen's Park Club, the most prestigious club on the island, nor would there have been any white players. Writing in 1927, in the expectation that Dewhurst would tour England the following year, his 1923 team-mate C. R. Browne wrote that Dewhurst's [...] "heart <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> his body" [...] and that his [...] "expansive smile captures many victims". He described him as [...] "very unassuming, but winning in appearance Dewhurst is effective in his job and inspires confidence in bowler and fieldsmen alike.

2500|$|The Anonymous Conqueror wrote, They {{lead him}} to the temple, where they dance and carry on joyously, and the man about to be {{sacrifice}}d dances and carries on like the rest. At length the man who offers the sacrifice strips him naked, and leads him at once to the stairway of the tower where is the stone idol.

Soon comes the sacrificing priest--and this is no small office among them--armed with a stone knife, which cuts like steel, and <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> <b>as</b> one of our large knives. He plunges the knife into the breast, opens it, and tears out the heart hot and palpitating. And this as quickly as one might cross himself. At this point the chief priest of the temple takes it, and anoints {{the mouth of the}} principal idol with the blood; then filling his hand with it he flings it towards the sun, or towards some star, if it be night. Then he anoints the mouths of all the other idols of wood and stone, and sprinkles blood on the cornice of the chapel of the principal idol. Afterwards they burn the heart, preserving the ashes as a great relic, and likewise they burn the body of the sacrifice, but these ashes are kept apart from those of the heart in a different vase.|$|E
