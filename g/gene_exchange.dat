25|$|The EPS matrix {{consists}} of exopolysaccharides, proteins and nucleic acids. A {{large proportion of}} the EPS is more or less strongly hydrated, however, hydrophobic EPS also occur; one example is cellulose which is produced by a range of microorganisms. This matrix encases the cells within it and facilitates communication among them through biochemical signals as well as <b>gene</b> <b>exchange.</b> The EPS matrix also traps extracellular enzymes and keeps them in close proximity to the cells. Thus, the matrix represents an external digestion system and allows for stable synergistic microconsortia of different species (Wingender and Flemming, Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 8, 623-633). Some biofilms have been found to contain water channels that help distribute nutrients and signalling molecules. This matrix is strong enough that under certain conditions, biofilms can become fossilized (Stromatolites).|$|E

However, recently introduced varieties from northern Mediterranean areas are also encountered in this region. Do <b>gene</b> <b>exchanges</b> occur between local apricot and introduced varieties? We addressed this question by analyzing the genetic structure of 183 accessions using 24 nuclear microsatellite markers and a model-based Bayesian clustering method. We classified these accessions into 4 genetic clusters: cluster 1 from Morocco, cluster 2 from northern, central and southern Tunisia which were all propagated by grafting, cluster 3 from the oasis region in Tunisia and the Messaad region in Algeria, and finally, cluster 4 (green) included accessions belonging to the northern Mediterranean gene pool. These accessions were more diversified and genetically differentiated with respect to local North African apricot. The results revealed the presence of admixed accessions between the local gene pool and introduced varieties, mainly in seed propagated populations, thus highlighting the presence of <b>gene</b> <b>exchanges</b> between northern and southern Mediterranean countries. Our findings should be useful for improving the management and conservation of Maghrebian apricot genetic resources...|$|R

2500|$|The {{waters of}} the Southern Ocean form a system of currents. Whenever there is a West Wind Drift, the surface strata travels around Antarctica in an easterly direction. Near the continent, the East Wind Drift runs counterclockwise. At the front between both, large eddies develop, for example, in the Weddell Sea. The krill swarms swim with these water masses, to {{establish}} one single stock all around Antarctica, with <b>gene</b> <b>exchange</b> over the whole area. Currently, there is little knowledge of the precise migration patterns since individual krill cannot yet be tagged to track their movements. The largest shoals are visible from space and can be tracked by satellite. One swarm covered an area of [...] of ocean, {{to a depth of}} [...] and was estimated to contain over 2 million tons of krill. Recent research suggests that krill do not simply drift passively in these currents but actually modify them. By moving vertically through the ocean on a 12-hour cycle, the swarms play a major part in mixing deeper, nutrient-rich water with nutrient-poor water at the surface.|$|E

50|$|In general, organisms can inherit {{genes in}} two ways: {{vertical}} gene transfer and horizontal gene transfer.

40|$|Freshwaters, {{with the}} {{exception}} of large lakes, are divided into many different biotopes, generally of small size and isolated by geographical or ecological barriers which prevent <b>gene</b> <b>exchanges</b> between populations. Therefore, segregation {{plays a major role in}} freshwater fish speciation in Africa. Some groups of species develop unique ways of speciation e. g. chromosomal translocations for cyprinodonts, ethological segregation for cichlids. The importance of these phenomena in evolution and species multiplication has been demonstrated. Nevertheless, there are still large gaps in our knowledge of reproductive isolation processes in African freshwater fishes. Attempts to cross-fertilize and study hybrids will probably give us much more information on the degree of reproductive isolation of species which itself is the very essence of the biological species and of speciation.

On the other hand, fortuitous or adaptive differentiation for chromosomal alterations or genetic incompatibility has, in many groups of plants, let to reproductive isolation in the absence of genetic differentiation commensurate with that associated with species. It is not my intention to deny a correlation which obviously exists or to minimize the role of reproductive isolation isolation in species formation. I do, however, wish to emphasize that among plants this correlation is far from unity, except, perhaps, for certain groups. This does not mean that reproductive isolation is not taxonomically important, but that alone it does not necessarily provide the only, or the best, basis for delimiting species in all groups of organisms...This stands in marked contrast to the situation in many groups of animals in which reproductive isolation seems to have a positive selective value in areas where genetically differentiated groups overlap (see Dobzhansky, 1951, chap 7) ...|$|E
