40|$|Källsner and Girhammar [1] have {{presented}} a new plastic design method for wood-framed shear walls at ultimate limit state. This method allows the designer {{to calculate the}} load-carrying capacity of partially anchored shear walls, where the leading stud is not anchored against uplift. The anchorage system of shear walls is provided by anchor bolts in the bottom rail and hold downs at the leading stud. Anchor bolts provide horizontal shear continuity between the bottom rail and the foundation. Hold downs are directly connecting the vertical leading stud to the foundation. Sometimes hold downs are not provided and only the bottom rail is anchored to the substrate. In this case the bottom row of nails transmits the vertical forces in the sheathing to the bottom rail (instead of the stud) where the anchor bolts will further transmit the forces into the foundation. In this report hold downs have been experimentally studied {{with respect to the}} strength and stiffness of the connection. Four different types of hold downs have been tested. The specimen was subjected to tension load applied to the stud. Four tests series are presented. Each series was divided into different sets according to the type of fastener used with the <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> <b>device.</b> The results show that the failure load is higher when hold downs with anchor bolts are used, up to ten times higher than the anchorage that uses only screws or nails. The failure mode vary with the type of hold down and the type of fasteners used. The tests showed three primary failure modes: failure of the stud when a bolt is used as the fastener between <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> <b>device</b> and stud, failure due to pull-out of the screws or nails from the rail and failure due to failure or pull-out of screws or nails from stud. Also, failure of the stud itself occurred in some tests caused by some defect of the timberGodkänd; 2012; 20120116 (giucap...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT RELIABILITY AND EFFECT OF PARTIALLY RESTRAINED WOOD SHEAR WALLS by JOHN J. GRUBER MARCH 2012 Advisor:	Dr. Gongkang Fu Major:		Civil Engineering Degree:	Doctor or Philosophy The {{prescriptive}} {{design of}} the most widely used residential building code in the United States, the IRC, allows the use of partially restrained wood shear walls to resist wind and seismic loads. Wind load is the most common controlling lateral design load for these structures. In contrast, the complimenting building code, the IBC, requires either a restraining dead load or a mechanical <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> <b>device</b> to resist overturning. To prescribe a safe structure, {{it is important to know}} the effect of partial restraint on the overturning resistance of wood shear walls constructed in accordance with the IRC and equally important whether the partially restrained wood shear walls provide the same level of reliability as fully restrained wood shear walls for wind load. This is the focus of this research. Twenty five Monotonic tests were conducted of 42 ̆ 7 x 82 ̆ 7 wood shear walls with five varying restraining methods (wall types). There were five sets of five wall types. One of the sets had only an anchor bolt, three sets had different dead loads with one anchor bolt, and one set had a mechanical hold down. The results of the test program were used to determine the partial restraint effect, create a nonlinear finite element model, and to determine the statistical data required to perform a Monte Carlo simulation of the wall behavior. The Monte Carlo simulation result was used to calibrate a nonlinear partial restraint factor to a target reliability index of 3. 25. The calibration was performed for both ASD and LRFD load combinations as required by the IBC. The research concludes with a closed-form solution, including the calibrated nonlinear partial restraint factor developed, to determine the unit shear capacity of a partially restrained or fully restrained (with dead load or mechanical hold down) wood shear wall constructed in accordance with the IRC by utilizing the fully restrained nominal unit shear values of AF 2 ̆ 6 PA 2 ̆ 7 s Special Design Provisions for Wind and Seismic...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this part}} 2, the {{practical}} design {{and strength of}} a number of different joints is described: (1) Sheathing-to-framing joints – the plastic design method is {{based on the premise that}} the load-displacement relationship of the sheathing-to-framing joints has sufficiently large plastic deformation capacity; the sheathing-to-framing joints have great influence on the load-carrying capacity of the wall; (2) Stud-to-rail joints – by utilizing the shear capacity of the stud-to-rail joints, the plastic design method can be simplified and the load-carrying capacity can be increased; (3) <b>Hold</b> <b>down</b> <b>devices</b> for the (leading) stud – the capacity of the tying down force of the <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> determines whether the shear wall will act as fully or partially anchored; tying down the shear walls by connecting them to the transverse walls leads to a 3 -dimensioonal behaviour that is a very favourable for the load-carrying capacity and the stiffness of the shear wall; through transverse walls the anchoring of the leading stud can be reduced or eliminated (those types of transverse wall connections are not discussed in detail in this paper); and (4) Anchoring devices for the bottom rail – in partially anchored shear walls it is necessary that the bottom rail is anchored to the substrate against uplift. Characteristic values for the different types of joints are given. Also, joints between the panels in the walls, roofs and floors are described briefly...|$|R

40|$|Pretensioned {{prestressed}} concrete {{can be produced}} {{in a number of}} ways. Among them several options can be considered depending on the structure constructed and how prestress is transferred. In the recent times radial and longitudinal cracks have been observed due to high tensile stresses developed in concrete around prestressing steel. In practice to eliminate these harmful conditions modifications are required to ensure serviceability functions of the composite high quality material. Often excessive prestress is reduced by lowering the tensile stress in the prestressing steel or / and the magnitude of the eccentricity {{towards the end of the}} member which in vulnerable to this type of effect. In the global context debonding of tendons towards the end of a member, drapping of tendon towards the central portion of the member or controlled detensioning can be applied to achieve the desire outcomes. All these techniques require a sound basis for prestress transfer which is achieved by bond. Some of the practices are prohibitive to developing countries due to the high cost of <b>holding</b> <b>down</b> <b>devices</b> buried in the concrete. Further in third world countries cost of hardware is expensive as opposed to cheep labour encountered in production. This research is aimed at strengtheni~g our understanding of bond mechanism by extending cohesive cracking approach established by experiment and matched by a sound theoretical basis to complement each other. Currently some of the global practices are carried out by relying on. intuition as opposed to theoretical formulations. This study covers a 'comprehensive analysis of bond development for the controlled detensioned process. The experimental verification is not part of the present scope. However the parameters influencing such as strand diameter, initial prestress, concrete strength and cover or half the spacing have been identified as main influences to ascertain bond strength based on available test results exhumed from literature. A parametric study has also been carried out and simplified empirical formulae have been developed to predict normal transfer bond length and the type of bond length required for controlled detensioning. The derived theory is also applicable even to debonded tendons as well as drapped tendons accurately. Further study is required to support these findings by providing experimental evidenc...|$|R
