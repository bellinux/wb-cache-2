Thermoluminescence spectra of rare earth doped calcium {{fluoride}} samples, both powder and single crystal, were recorded over the temperature range from 25 K to 673 K. Although some broad band features exist, the spectra are dominated by the rare <b>earth</b> <b>line</b> transitions. The glow peak temperatures are slightly sensitive both to the ionic size of the dopants and the dopant concentration. By contrast, very considerable differences are generated by heat treatments, such as annealing followed by either fast or slow cooling.

The L 5 vantage point provides an unprecedented view of the solar disturbances and their solar sources that can greatly advance the science behind space weather.

In addition, an inner coronal imager and a magnetograph from L 5 can give advance information on active regions and coronal holes that will soon rotate on to the solar disk. Radio remote sensing at low frequencies can provide information on shock-driving CMEs, the most dangerous of all CMEs. Coordinated helioseismic measurements from the Sun <b>Earth</b> <b>line</b> and L 5 provide information on the physical conditions {{at the base of the}} convection zone, where solar magnetism originates. Finally, in situ measurements at L 5 can provide information on the large-scale solar wind structures (corotating interaction regions (CIRs)) heading towards Earth that potentially result in adverse space weather...|$|E

40|$|Gamma-ray blazars {{are among}} the most extreme astrophysical sources, {{harboring}} phenomena far more energetic than those attainable by terrestrial accelerators. These galaxies are understood to be active galactic nuclei that are powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes and have relativistic jets pointed along the <b>Earth</b> <b>line</b> of sight. The emission displayed is variable at all wavelengths and timescales probed thus far, necessitating contemporaneous broadband observations to disentangle the details of the emission processes within the relativistic jets. The very high energy (VHE; E> 100 GeV) photons emitted by these sources are detectable with ground-based imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes such as VERITAS. As these photons propagate extragalactic distances, the interaction with the diffuse starlight that pervades the entire Universe results in a distance and energy dependent gamma-ray opacity, offering a unique method for probing photon densities on cosmological scales. These galaxies have also been postulated to be potential sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, a theory which can be examined through deep gamma-ray observations of sources which probe moderate gamma-ray opacities. Within this work, I will highlight ongoing research regarding the broadband emission from VERITAS-observed VHE blazars, as well as the potential to use them for cosmological insight.

For the principal event being analysed here we demonstrate an ability to track a CME from the corona to over 40 degrees. The time altitude history shows a constant speed of ascent over at least the first 50 solar radii and some evidence for deceleration at distances of over 20 degrees. Comparisons of associated coronagraph data and the HI images show that the basic structure of the CME remains clearly intact as it propagates from the corona into the heliosphere. Extracting the CME signal requires a consideration of the F-coronal intensity distribution, which can be identified from the HI data. Thus we present the preliminary results on this measured F-coronal intensity and compare these to the modelled F-corona of Koutchmy and Lamy (IAU Colloq. 85, 63, 1985). This analysis demonstrates that CME material some two orders of magnitude weaker than the F-corona can be detected; a specific example at 40 solar radii revealed CME intensities as low as 1. 7 × 10 [SUP]- 14 [/SUP] of the solar brightness. These observations herald a new era in CME research as we extend our capability for tracking, in particular, Earth-directed CMEs into the heliosphere. Peer reviewe...|$|E
