25|$|In 1808 Southey met Walter Savage Landor, {{whose work}} he admired, {{and they became}} close friends. That same year he wrote Letters from England under the {{pseudonym}} Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella, an account of a tour supposedly from a foreigner's viewpoint. Through the mouth of his pseudonym Southey is critical of the disparity between the <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> <b>have-nots</b> in English society, arguing that a change in taxation policy {{would be needed to}} foster a greater degree of equity.|$|E
25|$|Trade {{dramatically}} altered Duala society. European goods became status symbols, {{and some}} rulers appointed Western traders and missionaries as advisors. A {{high proportion of}} Duala grew wealthy through the new trade, and tensions arose between the <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> <b>have-nots.</b> Competition escalated between coastal groups and even between related settlements. Traders exploited this atmosphere, and beginning in 1860, German, French, and Spanish merchants had established contacts and weakened the British monopoly. The Duala had gained a virtual hegemony over trade through the Wouri estuary.|$|E

500|$|Former {{legislator}} Albert Cheng {{noted that}} had Bokhary been charged under the Police Ordinance, {{and not the}} Offences Against the Person Ordinance, she would have faced a custodial sentence of up to two years; furthermore, the police failed to charge Bokhary for allegedly assaulting a policewoman {{at the police station}} after her arrest; the police also prosecuted her for careless driving instead of the more serious offence of dangerous driving. Cheng said: [...] "The public certainly has the right to voice its anger against any injustice. But, in this case, its targets shouldn't be the government or the courts, but Secretary for Justice Wong Yan-lung, who is responsible for prosecutions and all government legal matters." [...] Legislator and former Secretary for Security, Regina Ip, said: [...] "At the end of the day, the sense of outrage is not about justice and penalties, but about the widening inequality between rich and poor, between the corporate giant and the artless individual, and the yawning asymmetry of money, knowledge and expert power between the <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> <b>have-nots</b> of our society." [...] Political commentator Michael Chugani agreed that public anger existed due to the belief that Hong Kong society had become too unfair, and that the verdict was confirmation to some of this view. He said that the public outrage responsible for forcing the Department of Justice to appeal against Bokhary's sentence was unlikely to result in a happy ending because both outcomes were potentially damaging: the jailing of Bokhary would imply the judicial system had succumbed to public pressure; if she was not jailed, the system would be tarnished by accusations of favouritism.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1930s, when Rowland Brown {{enjoyed his}} [...] "fifteen minutes of fame." [...] the {{atmosphere}} {{had changed in}} a number of important ways. The movie industry was subdued by the establishment of regulatory laws, the rise of unions and guilds, and increasing enforcement of the Motion Picture Production Code. The Production Code brought censorship and restriction of content in a time of turmoil that challenged the foundations of American society. The stock market had crashed, taking the roar out of the Twenties, causing widespread unemployment and widening the gap between the <b>Haves</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have-nots.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) {{conducted}} the first survey to assess Internet usage among what the study deemed the 'haves' and the 'have-nots' of American society in 1995. After U.S. President Bill Clinton adopted the phrase, [...] "the digital divide" [...] in his 2000 State of the Union address, researchers have identified numerous origins and aversions explaining trends in access and usage {{of information and}} communication technologies between the groups of United States' <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> <b>have-nots.</b> Over the past decade, several of these demographic access and usage gaps have narrowed, or closed altogether, while others continue to show a lack of connectivity for the group; these include gaps {{on the basis of race}} and ethnicity and income.|$|E

5000|$|BytesForAll {{has argued}} that it goes [...] "beyond the popular concept of digital divide. We not only {{recognize}} {{that there is a}} widespread disparity between information <b>have</b> <b>and</b> <b>have-nots</b> (in terms of access and distribution) but also raise and analyze the issues that put them trapped into it and bring about solutions wherever they exist." [...] It adds that this network [...] "want(s) to see how IT are being used {{for the benefit of the}} dis-empowered, one who has no purchasing power to tempt the market to build solutions for him or her." ...|$|R
60|$|Things {{might have}} {{remained}} equal {{even in this}} state, if talents had only been equal, and if for example the employment of iron and the consumption of agricultural produce had always exactly balanced one another. But the stronger did more work; the cleverer got more advantage from his work; the more ingenious found means of shortening his labour; the husbandman had more need of metal, or the smith more need of grain; and while working equally, one got much gain, and the other could scarcely live. This distinction between <b>Have</b> <b>and</b> <b>Have-not</b> led to confusion and revolt, to brigandage {{on the one side}} and constant insecurity on the other.|$|R
50|$|Equivalence is {{a project}} which talks about the {{tensions}} between a need and a want, from the <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> the <b>have-nots.</b> By comparing the value between a luxury item over a daily necessity, the project aims to invoke the question of equality in the viewer’s mind.|$|R
50|$|Two Americas is a {{catch phrase}} {{referring}} to social stratification in American society, made famous in a 2004 speech by former U.S. Senator and {{former presidential candidate}} John Edwards, originally referring to <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> <b>have-nots.</b> The speech has since become popular and inspired many parodies and similar metaphors.|$|E
50|$|Potential Impacts on Society - {{despite some}} {{economic}} benefits of ICT to individuals, {{there is evidence that}} the computer literacy and access gap between the <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> <b>have-nots</b> may be increasing. Education and information access are more than ever the keys to economic prosperity, yet access by individuals in different countries is not equal - this social inequity has become known as the digital divide.|$|E
50|$|The {{digital divide}} was first widely {{discussed}} by journalists, academics, and governmental {{agencies in the}} 1990s. The digital divide was used {{to distinguish between the}} digital accessibility of wealthy and lower-income groups. Jessamyn C. West defines the digital divide as the gap between individuals who can and cannot easily access technology, or the <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> <b>have-nots.</b> The digital divide highlights the privileges individuals have in accessing technology.|$|E
5000|$|Local Service Districts {{originated}} {{from the former}} civil parishes when, in the 1960s, a new local governance structure was introduced to replace county government. County councils were described as [...] "out-dated" [...] and dysfunctional. This was {{a consequence of the}} Ed Byrne Commission report recommendations and subsequent Equal Opportunity legislation introduced by Premier Louis Robichaud, intending {{to level the playing field}} between <b>have</b> <b>and</b> <b>have-not</b> regions of the Province. These reforms also saw a significant revamp of property assessments and taxation and so were characterized as sweeping social reforms. County municipalities were [...] "abolished", 'un-incorporating' the parish districts and incorporating many of the larger communities they had contained. The Province undertook management of local service provision responsibilities in these unincorporated units, resulting in significant growth of the civil service.|$|R
40|$|Globalisation is {{a process}} in which {{national}} economies become integrated into global economy. Globalisation brings benefits and opportunities such as reducing the unemployment rate and poverty. However there are many critics about globalisation. One of them is that it widen the gap between the <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> the <b>have-nots</b> in a country. High quality of global financial reporting can be achieved through the implementation of IFRS. It helps users (investors and creditors) in making decisions related to the allocation of resources, especially to companies in their country or in other countries. Hopefully, resource allocation in the era of globalisation can be done effectively and efficiently. For many years, in developing countries and poor countries the number of unskilled labor much more than the skilled labor. This led to formation of gap between the <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> the <b>have-nots.</b> Now, companies are expected not only looking for profit, but must pay attention to human resources (people) and environment (planet) as well. Companies should play an active role {{to improve the quality of}} human resources. So, the number of unskilled labor will be reduced and skilled labor is increased. Commonly, skilled labor will receive higher benefits (salaries) than the unskilled labor. Therefore, if the number of skilled labor increasing, the gap between the <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> the <b>have-nots</b> will be narrowed...|$|R

50|$|Expanding on the {{definition}} of the digital divide, Howard Besser argues that the digital divide means more than technology access between the <b>haves</b> <b>and</b> <b>have-nots.</b> The digital divide encompasses aspects such as information literacy, appropriateness of content, and access to content. Beyond access, a digital divide exists between those who have the ability to apply critical thinking to technology. Language and English fluency creates a barrier in the digital divide as well, as most content online is written in English. The digital divide includes a gap between individuals who have the ability to create digital content or are merely consumers.|$|E
