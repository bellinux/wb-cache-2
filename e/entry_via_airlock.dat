40|$|Equine {{herpesvirus}} 1 (EHV- 1) is {{a member}} of the Alphaherpesvirinae, and its broad tissue tropism suggests that EHV- 1 may use multiple receptors to initiate virus entry. EHV- 1 entry was thought to occur exclusively through fusion at the plasma membrane, but recently <b>entry</b> <b>via</b> the endocytic/phagocytic pathway was reported for Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K 1 cells). Here we show that cellular integrins, and more specifically those recognizing RGD motifs such as alpha V beta 5, are important during the early steps of EHV- 1 <b>entry</b> <b>via</b> endocytosis in CHO-K 1 cells. Moreover, mutational analysis revealed that an RSD motif in the EHV- 1 envelope glycoprotein D (gD) is critical for <b>entry</b> <b>via</b> endocytosis. In addition, we show that EHV- 1 enters peripheral blood mononuclear cells predominantly via the endocytic pathway, whereas in equine endothelial cells <b>entry</b> occurs mainly <b>via</b> fusion at the plasma membrane. Taken together, the data in this study provide evidence that EHV- 1 <b>entry</b> <b>via</b> endocytosis is triggered by the interaction between cellular integrins and the RSD motif present in gD and, moreover, that EHV- 1 uses different cellular entry pathways to infect important target cell populations of its natural host...|$|R

The complexity of the process requires investigations at a systems biology level, which involves the combination of different experimental approaches, the collaboration of experimentalists and theorists across different disciplines, and the development of novel multiscale models...|$|R

40|$|Arterial and airway chemoreceptors {{respond to}} acute hypoxia by depolarizing, thereby {{activating}} voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels and so permitting Ca 2 +entry to trigger transmitter release. Following periods of prolonged hypoxia, these cells undergo {{a form of}} remodelling which involves altered expression of ion channels. Here, we use microspectrofluorimetric recordings of voltage-gated Ca 2 + entry (activated by exposure of cells to 50 mM K+) to show that chronic hypoxia suppresses such Ca 2 + entry in model airway chemoreceptor (H 146) cells. Furthermore, Ca 2 + <b>entry</b> <b>via</b> L-type channels is suppressed, whilst <b>entry</b> <b>via</b> N-type channels is greatly enhanced. The suppressed response, together with dramatic remodelling of routes available for voltage-gated Ca 2 + entry, is likely to alter significantly the acute O 2 sensing properties of these cells...|$|R

(2) Somatostatin-like immunoreactivity is released from isolated myenteric ganglia after stimulation with veratridine or the ganglionic agonist dimethylphenylpiperazinium (DMPP). (3) Calcium <b>entry</b> <b>via</b> the N-type channel appears to play a dominant role in DMPP-induced release of SLI.

40|$|Abstract—During {{ischemia}} and reperfusion, with {{an increase}} in intracellular Na and a depolarized membrane potential, Ca 2 may enter the myocyte in exchange for intracellular Na via reverse-mode Na-Ca 2 exchange (NCX). To test the role of Ca 2 <b>entry</b> <b>via</b> NCX during ischemia and reperfusion, we studied mice with cardiac-specific ablation of NCX (NCX-KO) and demonstrated that reverse-mode Ca 2 influx is absent in the NCX-KO myocytes. Langendorff perfused hearts were subjected to 20 minutes of global ischemia followed by 2 hours of reperfusion, during which time we monitored high-energy phosphates using 31 P-NMR and left-ventricular developed pressure. In another group of hearts, we monitored intracellular Na using 23 Na-NMR. Consistent with Ca 2 <b>entry</b> <b>via</b> NCX during ischemia, we found that hearts lacking NCX exhibited less of a decline in ATP during ischemia, delayed ischemic contracture, and reduced maximum contracture. Furthermore, on reperfusion following ischemia, NCX-KO hearts had much less necrosis, better recovery of left-ventricular developed pressure, improved phosphocreatine recovery, and reduced Na overload. The improved recovery of function following ischemia in NCX-KO hearts was not attributable to the reduced preischemic contractility in NCX-KO hearts, because when the preischemic workload was matched by treatment with isoproterenol, NCX-KO hearts still exhibited improved postischemic function compared with wild-type hearts. Thus, NCX-KO hearts were significantly protected against ischemia-reperfusion injury, suggesting that Ca 2 <b>entry</b> <b>via</b> reverse-mode NCX is a major cause of ischemia/reperfusion injury.
