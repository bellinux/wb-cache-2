60|$|As {{they walk}} along, Mr. Snagsby observes, as a novelty, that however quick their pace may be, his {{companion}} still seems in some undefinable manner to lurk and lounge; also, that whenever he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> {{the right or}} left, he pretends to have a fixed purpose in his mind of going straight ahead, and wheels off, sharply, {{at the very last}} moment. Now and then, when they pass a police-constable on his beat, Mr. Snagsby notices that both the constable and his guide fall into a deep abstraction as they come towards each other, and appear entirely to overlook each other, and to gaze into space. In a few instances, Mr. Bucket, coming behind some under-sized young man with a shining hat on, and his sleek hair twisted into one flat curl on each side of his head, almost without glancing at him touches him with his stick, upon which the young man, looking round, instantly evaporates. For the most part Mr. Bucket notices things in general, with a face as unchanging as the great mourning ring on his little finger or the brooch, composed of not much diamond and a good deal of setting, which he wears in his shirt.|$|E
6000|$|The boat being thus guided, the cry [...] "Premi" [...] is {{the order}} from one gondolier to another {{that he should}} [...] "press" [...] or thrust forward his oar, without the back stroke, so as to send the boat's head round to the left; and the cry [...] "Stali" [...] is the order that he should give the return or upward stroke which sends the boat's head round to the right. Hence, if two gondoliers meet under any {{circumstances}} which render it a matter of question on which side they should pass each other, the gondolier who has {{at the moment the}} least power over his boat, cries to the other, [...] "Premi," [...] if he wishes the boats to pass with their right-hand sides to each other, and [...] "Stali," [...] if with their left. Now, in turning a corner, there is of course risk of collision between boats coming from opposite sides, and warning is always clearly and loudly given on approaching an angle of the canals. It is of course presumed that the boat which gives the warning will be nearer the turn than the one which receives and answers it; and therefore will not have so much time to check itself or alter its course. Hence the advantage of the turn, that is, the outside, which allows the fullest swing and greatest room for lee-way, is always yielded to the boat which gives warning. Therefore, if the warning boat is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the right, as it is to have the outside position, it will keep its own right-hand side to the boat which it meets, and the cry of warning is therefore [...] "Premi," [...] twice given; first as soon as it can be heard round the angle, prolonged and loud, with the accent on the e, and another strongly accented e added, a kind of question, [...] "Prémi-é," [...] followed at the instant of turning, with [...] "Ah Premí," [...] with the accent sharp on the final i. If, on the other hand, the warning boat is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> the left, it will pass with its left-hand side to the one it meets; and the warning cry is, [...] "Stáli-é, Ah Stalí." [...] Hence the confused idea {{in the mind of the}} traveller that Stali means [...] "to the left," [...] and [...] "Premi" [...] to the right; while they mean, in reality, the direct reverse; the Stali, for instance, being the order to the unseen gondolier who may be behind the corner, coming from the left-hand side, that he should hold as much as possible to his own right; this being the only safe order for him, whether he is going to turn the corner himself, or to go straight on; for as the warning gondola will always swing right across the canal in turning, a collision with it is only to be avoided by keeping well within it, and close up to the corner which it turns.|$|E

5000|$|Following Arianna's tragic death, Gabi {{leaned on}} her {{sister-in-law}} Sami Brady's (Alison Sweeney) son, Will Horton (Chandler Massey) for support. Of a possible Will and Gabi pairing, Rodriguez said [...] "I {{think that would}} be so perfect. They're so compatible. They're just very good people. I {{think that would be}} fun, and I think the audience would like that." [...] Both virgins, the couple had sex. However, Will soon lost all interest in sleeping with her again which was unsettling to Gabi.

[...] Previewing Gabi's reaction, the actress said: [...] "I feel like when it happens she is going to understand what it was.

5000|$|Finally, {{the role}} of the anchor {{correlates}} with the analogous, authority- and information-bearing positions already well-established in American politics, and the benefits it confers upon the political realm elucidate the compatibility between these two systems of information. Once again, Morse outlines this relationship between the anchor and the larger context in which they operate: [...] "since there are few other organs for inclusive and substantial discourse on social and cultural values in American life, the responsibility for interpreting the world and posing a political course of action and a social agenda falls on a very limited number of public personas, including such news personalities and the president". She levies a criticism against the anchor in this case, claiming that by decreasing the number of people responsible for delivering the news, American viewers receive a bottlenecked stream of information about their surroundings. The choreography and performativity involved {{in the construction of the}} news broadcast dramatizes political processes, but in doing so, exposes its flattening of subjectivity and insistence upon itself as the final word of truth. More specifically, [...] "the news media may do 'an important social good when using the techniques of dramaturgy to make governance more interesting to people than would be the case otherwise.' At the same time, however, 'there is an important difference between drama and democracy, with the former requiring spectators and the latter participants.'" [...] In contrast to perceptions of the news as a one-sided relationship with its viewers, some believe that the news works in conjunction with its audience to produce the most efficient picture possible of the world. Tom Brokaw, in speaking about his experiences as a news anchor for NBC, explained how news stories for the length of their duration tend to feed off viewers' demands, and that news is inherently a [...] "populist medium", and that [...] "people are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> television networks for a historically accurate and detailed description of what happened." ...|$|E

40|$|In this study, I {{attempt to}} examine a {{language}} of affect and attitude towards internal feelings from a viewpoint of a stress reaction in adolescence. Language of affect has been defined by name of 2 ̆ 2 sadness 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 happiness 2 ̆ 2 expressing internal states and situation (Saeki, 2003).

40|$|The United States 2 ̆ 7 {{commitment}} to adversarial justice is {{a defining feature of}} its legal system. Standing doctrine, for example, {{is supposed to}} ensure that courts can rely on adverse parties to present the facts courts need to resolve disputes. Although the U. S. legal system generally lives up to this adversarial ideal, it sometimes does not. Appellate courts often look outside the record the parties developed before the trial court, turning instead to their own independent research and to factual claims in amicus briefs. This deviation from the adversarial process is an important respect in which the nation 2 ̆ 7 s adversarial commitment is more myth than reality. This myth is problematic for many reasons, including the fact that it obscures the extent to which some of the most significant cases the Supreme Court decides, such as Citizens United v. FEC, rely upon 2 ̆ 2 facts 2 ̆ 2 that have not been subjected to rigorous adversarial testing. The adversarial myth exists because the U. S. legal system 2 ̆ 7 s current procedures were designed to address adjudicative facts-facts particularly within the legislative facts-more general facts {{about the state of the}} world. Recognizing knowledge of the parties-but many cases turn instead on this distinction between adjudicative and legislative facts helps identify those cases in which existing practices undermine, rather than promote, adversarial justice. This Article concludes with suggestions for reform, including liberalizing standing doctrine when legislative facts are at issue. If courts are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> nonparties for help in resolving disputes of legislative fact, it is better that they be brought into the process earlier so the factual claims they offer can be rigorously tested...|$|E
