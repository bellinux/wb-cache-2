The climate coalition has at its disposal sign-unconstrained taxes on emissions in both periods, as in Eichner and Pethig (2011 b), but in the present study it has the additional option of taxing consumption. The central question is whether and how the coalition makes use of consumption taxes along with emission taxes in its unilateral cost- effective ceiling policy. We identify cost-effective policies under various conditions and find that all consist of a (positive) tax on first-period consumption and of emission taxes whose rates are negative in the second period but may take on either sign in the first period. carbon <b>emissions,</b> <b>ceiling,</b> unilateral, cost-effective regulation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Critical {{loads and}} their exceedances {{were used as}} the basis for the {{negotiation}} of the Gothenburg Protocol and the National <b>Emissions</b> <b>Ceilings</b> Directive to reduce emissions of sulphur and nitrogen by 2010. Since emissions have already been significantly reduced the associated cost in further emission reductions is high. Hence the policy maker needs to know and understand the uncertainties in critical loads and their exceedances, upon which any future abatement policy would be based. In this paper the effect of using uncertain deposition data on the critical load exceedance calculation is presented. Deposition data from the Hull Acid Rain Model (HARM) has been used in this analysis. Deposition uncertainty estimates have previously been calculated for each 10 km grid square in Wales using Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation methodology (GLUE). The critical loads data was not varied in this analysis. Distributions of critical load exceedances were constructed from the uncertainties in deposition estimates. Four separate methods of visually presenting the uncertain exceedance data to the policy maker are presented. These methods allow the identification of areas subject to different levels of risk...|$|R

40|$|How to {{implement}} emission trading is one {{question in the}} current negotiations on a new sulfur protocol in Europe. Whereas the current protocol stipulates a 30 percent uniform reduction, national <b>emission</b> <b>ceilings</b> included in the proposed new protocol imply differentiated reductions. In addition, emission and fuel standards are proposed. This paper examines the costs and environmental impacts of emission trading. Emission trading combined with regulations is a new element in the paper. Calculations using the RAINS (Regional Acidification INformation and Simulation) model suggest that overlaying emission trading on regulations not only reduces the cost savings but has beneficial impacts as well: ecosystem protection is not changed and significant decreases in environmental benefits for countries are largely avoided. Emission trading {{can also be used}} to decrease emissions and increase ecosystem protection. If combined with existing legislation, emission trading minimizes losses in expected environmental benefits for some countries, and most countries gain. However, the initial distribution of <b>emission</b> <b>ceilings</b> has to be used so that some countries are not confronted with higher costs. Trade-offs appear to exist between the use of emission trading to achieve cost savings on the one hand, and ecosystem protection and distributional equity on the other.

Our contribution is {{to argue that}} the conflict between the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) stems mainly from disagreement on the cost issue. We argue that the three main concerns promoted by the EU in The Hague. First, a 50 % national <b>emission</b> <b>ceiling</b> (the supplementarity principle), second the use of carbon sinks, and third an international market control system. These issues can be solved by removing all restrictions on free greenhouse gas (GHG) trade and by establishing the World Trade Organization as an international authority. The US will face considerably higher costs than foreseen at the negotiations in Kyoto and will have strong incentives to free ride. Our main hypothesis is that the EU proposal on supplementarity made the US turn to free riding. Thus, to make the US stay in an international GHG emissiontrading scheme, the EU must reconsider and acknowledge US claims for cheaper reduction options and the right to trade ‘hot air’. This point is important. If the US does not participate, the increase in emissions will be much higher than the emission reductio...|$|R

In particular, we describe economic analysis of policy options designed to help the European Union (EU) to achieve its objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent and increasing the share of renewable energy to 20 percent by 2020. This analysis looked at cost-effectiveness and emission trading options as well as equity issues. We also discuss an economic analysis of policy options for including {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The analysis finds that CCS could result in significant cost savings. The additional costs of making CCS mandatory or using subsidies were also estimated. Economic assessments prepared for the revision of the national <b>emission</b> <b>ceiling</b> directive suggest that air pollution objectives can be met at modest costs and that monetary benefits exceed costs. The assessments also find that limiting the additional costs for poorer Member States does not increase overall costs significantly and that when limited to regional zones, emissions trading of air pollutants could save costs but might lead to hot spots.

On request of the Cabinet, the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (MNP) - RIVM took on the evaluation of the objectives and cost-effectiveness of this programme for. Conclusions and recommendations are reported here. A major conclusion is the strong probability that the Netherlands will not meet its international emission obligations for 3 out of 4 NEC compounds, SO 2, NOx and NMVOCs. Many of the measures and options for additional measures are not concrete and lack sufficient policy instruments for implementation. The choice made to translate national ceilings into sector targets has not been accepted by any of the sectors. This increases the risks surrounding implementation because of the uncertainty in the results of the policy package. Furthermore, the passage of time may mean that some of the reductions needed cannot be realised, making a declaration of default a very real possibility. In the case of ammonia, current policies may be sufficient to meet the target, although there is still a chance that the emission ceiling will be exceeded. Additional measures proposed are expected to bring the ammonia emissions under the ceiling. It will be possible to update the policy programme in 2006.
