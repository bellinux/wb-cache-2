2500|$|In a United States {{court case}} in 2017, , an appellate court was {{required}} to interpret a statute under which the [...] "canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution" [...] of certain goods were activities exempted from the <b>general</b> <b>requirement</b> of overtime pay; the question was whether this list included distribution of the goods, or only packing of the goods for distribution. The omission of the serial comma suggested one meaning, while the omission of the conjunction or before [...] "packing" [...] {{and the fact that}} the Maine Legislative Drafting Manual advised against use of the serial comma suggested another. The lower court held that [...] "distribution" [...] was itself an exempt activity. On appeal, however, the Circuit Court decided that the sentence was ambiguous and [...] "because, under Maine law, ambiguities in the state's wage and hour laws must be construed liberally in order to accomplish their remedial purpose", adopted the drivers' narrower reading of the exemption and ruled that those who distributed the goods were entitled to overtime. Thus, in this instance, it is implied that the fault lies in the absence of a serial comma. U.S. appeals judge David J. Barron wrote, [...] "For want of a comma, we have this case." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{opposed to}} tort and unjust enrichment, {{contract}} is typically {{viewed as the}} part of the law of obligations which deals with voluntary undertakings, and accordingly gives a high priority to ensuring that only bargains to which people have given their true consent will be enforced by the courts. While it is not always clear when people have truly agreed in a subjective sense, English law takes the view that when one person objectively manifests their consent to a bargain, they will be bound. However, not all agreements, even if they are relatively certain in subject matter, are considered enforceable. There is a rebuttable presumption that people do not wish to later have legal enforcement of agreements made socially or domestically. The general rule is that contracts require no prescribed form, such as being in writing, except where statute requires it, usually for large deals like the sale of land. In addition and in contrast to civil law systems, English common law carried a <b>general</b> <b>requirement</b> that all parties, in order to have standing to enforce an agreement, must have brought something of value, or [...] "consideration" [...] to the bargain. This old rule is full of exceptions, particularly where people wished to vary their agreements, through case law and the equitable doctrine of promissory estoppel. Moreover, statutory reform in the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 allows third parties to enforce the benefit of an agreement that they had not necessarily paid for so long as the original parties to a contract consented to them being able to do so.|$|E
2500|$|While it has {{not been}} the norm, {{employee}} participation rights in corporate governance have existed in many specific sectors, particularly universities, and many workplaces organised as partnerships. Since the turn of the 20th century Acts such as the Port of London Act 1908, Iron and Steel Act 1967, or the Post Office Act 1977 required all workers in those specific companies had votes to elect directors on the board, meaning the UK had some of the first [...] "codetermination" [...] laws in the world. However, as many of those Acts were updated, the Companies Act 2006 today still has no <b>general</b> <b>requirement</b> for workers to vote in the general meeting to elect directors, meaning corporate governance remains monopolised by shareholding institutions or asset managers. By contrast in 16 out of 28 EU member states employees have participation rights in private companies, including the election of members of the boards of directors, and binding votes on decisions about individual employment rights, like dismissals, working time and social facilities or accommodation. At board level, UK company law in principle allows any measure of employee participation, alongside shareholders, but voluntary measures have been rare outside employee share schemes that usually carry very little voice and increase employees' financial risk. Crucially, the Companies Act 2006 section 168 defines [...] "members" [...] as those with the ability to vote out the board. Under section 112 a [...] "member" [...] is anybody who initially subscribes their name to the company memorandum, or is later entered on the members' register, and is not required to have contributed money as opposed to, for instance, work. A company could write its constitution to make [...] "employees" [...] members with voting rights under any terms it chose.|$|E

2500|$|Direct {{participation}} {{rights in}} UK corporations {{and other forms}} of enterprise have a long history in specific sectors.

Moreover, under the European Company Statute, businesses that reincorporate as a Societas Europaea may opt to follow the Directive for employee involvement. An SE may have a two-tiered board, as in German companies, where shareholders and employees elect a supervisory board that in turn appoints a management board responsible for day-to-day running of the company. Or an SE can have a one tiered board, as every UK company, and employees and shareholders may elect board members in the desired proportion. An [...] "SE" [...] can have no fewer employee participation rights than what existed before, but for a UK company, there is likely to have been no participation in any case.|$|E
2500|$|English law draws a {{distinction}} between a [...] "debt", which is relevant for the cash flow test of insolvency under section 123(1)(e), and a [...] "liability", which becomes relevant for the second [...] "balance sheet" [...] test of insolvency under section 123(2). A debt is a sum due, and its quantity is a monetary sum, easily ascertained by drawing up an account. By contrast a liability {{will need to be}} quantified, as for instance, with a claim for a breach of contract and unliquidated damages. The balance sheet test asks whether [...] "the value of the company's assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities." [...] This, whether total assets are less than liabilities, may also be taken into account for the purpose of the same rules as the cash flow test (a winding up order, administration, and voidable transactions). But it is also the only test used for the purpose of the wrongful trading rules, and director disqualification. These rules potentially impose liability upon directors as a response to creditors being paid. This makes the balance sheet relevant, because if creditors are in fact all paid, the rationale for imposing liability on directors (assuming there is no fraud) drops away. Contingent and prospective liabilities refer to liability of a company that arise when an event takes place (e.g., defined as a contingency under a surety contract) or liabilities that may arise in future (e.g., probable claims by tort victims). The method for computing assets and liabilities depends on accountancy practice. These practices may legitimately vary. However, the law's <b>general</b> <b>requirement</b> is that accounting for assets and liabilities must represent a [...] "true and fair view" [...] of the company's finances. The final approach to insolvency is found under the Employment Rights Act 1996 section 183(3), which gives employees a claim for unpaid wages from the National Insurance fund. Mainly for the purpose of certainty of an objectively observable event, for these claims to arise, a company must have entered winding up, a receiver or manager must be appointed, or a voluntary arrangement must have been approved. The main reason employees have access to the National Insurance fund is that they bear significant risk that their wages will not be paid, given their place in the statutory priority queue.|$|E
