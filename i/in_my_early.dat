They're really hunted by their fans much more. I remember driving around these remote towns in Wales and kids running after us in the street. I was like, 'This is horrible!' And I saw the effect it had on him, and that's when I decided I never wanted to be a celebrity at that level, and I think that's why I've chosen to do the work that I do and just kind of work with directors that I love and try and do work that means something to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Hugh Mason was {{influenced}} by his father's Liberal politics and strongly opposed to injustice and prejudice. Thomas Mason was a supporter of political representation for Ashton-under-Lyne and supported {{the repeal of the}} Corn Laws. In the early 19th century, the area was poorly represented in Parliament. The major urban centres of Manchester, Salford, Bolton, Blackburn, Rochdale, Ashton-under-Lyne, Oldham and Stockport with a combined population of almost one million were represented by either the two county MPs for Lancashire (or the two for Cheshire in the case of Stockport). By comparison, {{more than half of all}} MPs were elected by a total of just 154voters. These inequalities in political representation led to calls for reform and eventually the Peterloo Massacre in 1819. Hugh said of his father that [...] "To his life of honest industry, to his example of commercial probity, to his high Christian character, to his training, of me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>early</b> years, to his wise consuls, I owe under God my position in society." ...|$|E
500|$|Nevelson {{continued}} to utilize wood in her sculptures, but also experimented with other {{materials such as}} aluminum, plastic and metal. [...] Black Zag X from 1969, {{in the collection of}} the Honolulu Museum of Art is an example of the artist's all-black assemblages incorporating the plastic, Formica. [...] In the fall of 1969, she was commissioned by Princeton University to create her first outdoor sculpture. After completion of her first outdoor sculptures, Nevelson stated: [...] "Remember, I was <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>early</b> seventies when I came into monumental outdoor sculpture... I had been through the enclosures of wood. I had been through the shadows. I had been through the enclosures and come out into the open." [...] Nevelson also praised new materials like plexiglas and cor-ten steel, which she described as a [...] "blessing". She embraced the idea of her works being able to withstand climate change and the freedom in moving beyond limitations in size. These public artworks were created by the Lippincott Foundry. Nevelson's public art commissions were a monetary success, but art historian Brooke Kamin Rapaport states that these pieces were not Nevelson's strongest works, and that Nevelson's [...] "intuitive gesture" [...] is not evident in the large steel works.|$|E

2500|$|In 1877, John Spencer-Churchill was {{appointed}} Viceroy of Ireland, with Randolph as his private secretary, {{resulting in the}} Churchill family's relocation to Dublin, a city in British-controlled Ireland. It was here that Jennie's second son, Jack, was born in 1880; there has been speculation that Randolph was not his biological father. Throughout much of the 1880s Randolph and Jennie were effectively estranged, during which she had many suitors. Churchill had virtually no relationship with his father; referring to his mother, Churchill later stated that [...] "I loved her dearly - but at a distance." [...] His relationship with Jack would be warm, and they were close at various points in their lives. In Dublin, he was educated in reading and mathematics by a governess, while {{he and his brother}} were cared for primarily by their nanny, Elizabeth Ann Everest; Churchill was devoted to her and nicknamed her [...] "Woomany". <b>In</b> <b>My</b> <b>Early</b> Life he wrote: [...] "She had been my dearest and most intimate friend during the whole of the twenty years I had lived." ...|$|E

2500|$|As was {{the custom}} {{of the day in}} her social class, Lady Randolph played a limited role in her sons' upbringing, relying largely upon nannies, {{especially}} Elizabeth Everest. Winston worshipped his mother, writing her numerous letters during his time at school and begging her to visit him, which, however, she rarely did. He wrote about her <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Early</b> Life: 'She shone for me like the evening star. I loved her dearly – but at a distance'. After he became an adult, they became good friends and strong allies, to the point where Winston regarded her almost as a political mentor, more as a big sister than as a mother. She was well-respected and influential in the highest British social and political circles. She was said to be intelligent, witty, and quick to laughter. It was said that Queen Alexandra especially enjoyed her company, although Jennie had been involved in an affair with her husband, the king, which was well known to Alexandra. Through her family contacts and her extramarital romantic relationships, Jennie greatly helped Lord Randolph's early career, {{as well as that of}} her son Winston.
