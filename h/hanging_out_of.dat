25|$|At the 1963 Belgian Grand Prix, Amon was partnered by Lucien Bianchi {{and started}} {{ahead of him}} from 15th position. After nine laps, however, an oil fire ended his race. He {{continued}} to experience mechanical problems at the Dutch, Mexican and German Grands Prix; and after an accident in practice for the Italian Grand Prix left him <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his car's cockpit with three broken ribs, he missed both the Italian and United States rounds.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{announces the}} plan to release a chemical called Agent Yellow into {{the river and the}} surrounding area, hoping it will kill the creature. Gang-du finds the creature's sleeping spot but sees no one there. As Gang-du climbs down to the hole, the monster passes over him. He sees Hyun-seo's arm <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> its mouth and gives chase, meeting Nam-joo on the way. The creature makes its way to the location where Agent Yellow is released and a large crowd has formed in protest.|$|E
25|$|The male {{dromedary}} camel has {{an organ}} called a dulla in its throat, a large, inflatable sac he extrudes {{from his mouth}} when in rut to assert dominance and attract females. It resembles a long, swollen, pink tongue <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the side of its mouth. Camels mate by having {{both male and female}} sitting on the ground, with the male mounting from behind. The male usually ejaculates three or four times within a single mating session. Camelids are the only ungulates to mate in a sitting position.|$|E
60|$|They {{spent the}} rest o' that day <b>'anging</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the winder, {{but it was not}} till ha'-past four in the after-noon that Isaac, still wearing Peter's clothes and {{carrying}} a couple of large green plants under 'is arm, turned into the road, and from the way 'e was smiling they thought it must be all right.|$|R
5000|$|Fanboys (cameo) Not {{actually}} [...] "Jay and Silent Bob", {{they are}} a close facsimile. (The roles were reversed. Smith's character was <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> in front <b>of</b> the gas station bathroom, pimping out Jason Mewes' character.) ...|$|R
50|$|Robinson {{is famous}} for <b>hanging</b> his tongue <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his mouth during competition, usually to the right, a quirk which many find endearing.|$|R
25|$|Upon {{completion}} of his training, {{he made his}} return to the ring to engage in yet another contest at the 205-pound limit, this time against fellow shoot wrestler Ken Shamrock. Three minutes into the bout, Sakuraba struck through Shamrock's guard with a left hand. Shamrock staggered back and ultimately fell into the ropes, his head <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the ring and his back turned to Sakuraba. Sakuraba rushed in to follow up but before any meaningful offense could be launched, the fight was halted by referee Yuji Shimada. Shamrock sprang to his feet immediately following the KO and protested vigorously. Opinions have been mixed regarding the KO's legitimacy; Ken's adopted brother and rival, Frank, has stated he believes the stoppage was justified, while others have come down on the opposing side.|$|E
25|$|He was a {{tall and}} bulky person with a {{prominent}} stomach and invariably played with a clean shaven head without any hat or cap {{or any kind of}} head gear. He always wore very loose pants and after batting for a while or keeping wicket for sometime his shirt will be <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the trousers and somebody must tuck it in, now and then. He had a rather ugly and uncouth stance at the wicket as he held his bat very low and bent his body forward so much that his head was practically in line with the top of the wickets. Those who watched him from the on side could only see his prominent hind portion of the body sticking up while the head, bat and the rest of Dilawar Hussain were hardly visible. However, he had a very sound defense and so {{it was very difficult to}} get him out. He was the most selfish batsman that I have ever seen.|$|E
500|$|The Doctor <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the TARDIS {{was filmed}} with Smith {{in front of}} a greenscreen, while the aerial footage of London was {{achieved}} with a helicopter. Smith stated that the scene was hard to visualise as it relied heavily on computer-generated images. Nearly every scene in the sequence is a visual effects shot, including a 3-D TARDIS flying over London and a CG Doctor <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the TARDIS in the aerial shots. Moffat realised that the Millennium Dome was visible in the final footage, and so the scene could not be set in 1996 before it had been built. Instead of a reshoot, Moffat explained that the TARDIS could be just about to go back in time and materialise in Amelia's garden. In post-production, 30 tracks of sound effects, music composed by Murray Gold specifically for the sequence, and Smith's [...] "grunting and groaning" [...] were added. The primarily music-led sequence was produced by Nikki Wilson, who receives a [...] "special thanks" [...] credit.|$|E
60|$|Again {{came that}} oppressive {{sense of the}} {{futility}} of the contemporary church, {{but this time it}} came in the most grotesque form. For <b>hanging</b> half <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the casement he was suddenly reminded of St. Francis of Assisi, and how at his rebuke the wheeling swallow stilled their cries.|$|R

60|$|The {{wheeling}} basket vomited {{its contents}} as it dropped. The theodolite hit a jutting cliff-ledge and exploded like a shell; the books, inkstands, paint-boxes, compasses, and rulers showed {{for a few}} seconds like a swarm of bees. Then they vanished; and, though Kim, <b>hanging</b> half <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the window, strained his young ears, never a sound came up from the gulf.|$|R
500|$|The {{most popular}} plumes came from various species of wading birds, known as [...] "little snowies" [...] for their snowy-white feathers; even more prized were the [...] "nuptial plumes", grown during mating season and {{displayed}} by birds during courtship. [...] Poachers often stole into the densely populated rookeries, {{where they would}} shoot and then pluck the roosting birds clean, leaving their carcasses to rot. [...] Unprotected eggs became easy prey for predators, as were newly hatched birds, who also starved or died from exposure. [...] One ex-poacher would later write of the practice, [...] "The heads and necks of the young birds were <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the nests by the hundreds. [...] I am done with bird hunting forever!" ...|$|E
500|$|Over 1,600 {{people were}} killed {{instantly}} and 9,000 were injured, more than 300 of whom later died. Every building within a [...] radius, over 12,000 in total, was destroyed or badly damaged. Hundreds {{of people who had}} been watching the fire from their homes were blinded when the blast wave shattered the windows in front of them. Stoves and lamps overturned by the force of the blast sparked fires throughout Halifax, particularly in the North End, where entire city blocks were caught up in the inferno, trapping residents inside their houses. Firefighter Billy Wells, who was thrown away from the explosion and had his clothes torn from his body, described the devastation survivors faced: [...] "The sight was awful, with people <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> windows dead. Some with their heads missing, and some thrown onto the overhead telegraph wires." [...] He was {{the only member of the}} eight-man crew of the fire engine [...] "Patricia" [...] to survive.|$|E
500|$|The {{trend of}} wearing whale tail-revealing jeans started to {{dissipate}} somewhat {{in the mid}} 2000s when American clothing designers started shifting focus from low-slung jeans and exposed midriffs to high-waisted trousers and cardigans. Jess Cartner-Morley, fashion writer of The Guardian, claimed that the whale tail and the muffin top (the bulge of flesh hanging {{over the top of}} low-rider jeans), [...] "twin crimes of modern fashion", had led to the decline in the popularity of hipster jeans. She quoted Louise Hunn, editor of the British edition of InStyle, as saying — [...] "When a look goes too mainstream, people start wearing it badly. And then the really fashionable people run a mile". While the thong still represented 24% of the US$2.5 billion annual market in women's underwear, it stopped growing by end of 2004. By 2007, thongs were overtaken by boyshorts and accounted for only 12% of the panties market. Some vendors, including Victoria's Secret and DKNY, started selling thongs that do not result in whale tails. Adam Lippes, founder of the lingerie line ADAM, said, [...] "Women got tired of it. And they got sick and tired of seeing string <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the top of every celebrity's jeans." ...|$|E
60|$|The baggage {{was already}} in the train that was waiting for them in the station, and in a few minutes it steamed away; the {{soldiers}} <b>hanging</b> far <b>out</b> <b>of</b> every window to wave a last goodbye to the weeping women who thronged the platform. Two hours later they reached Plymouth, marched through the town to the dockyard, and went straight on board the transport.|$|R
5000|$|He died October 1, 1899 in his rooms. He {{suffered}} a sudden hemorrhage and collapsed {{with his head}} <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> the window <b>of</b> his room. A contemporary report said that he bled [...] "more than a bucketful of blood" [...] onto the sidewalk below before the police broke into his lodging, finding the body still warm.|$|R
60|$|A strong shudder shook me. She was {{alluding}} to her chef, that superb artist. A monarch of his profession, unsurpassed--nay, unequalled--at dishing up {{the raw material}} so that it melted {{in the mouth of}} the ultimate consumer, Anatole had always been a magnet that drew me to Brinkley Court with my tongue <b>hanging</b> <b>out.</b> Many <b>of</b> my happiest moments had been those which I had spent champing this great man's roasts and ragouts, and the prospect of being barred from digging into them in the future was a numbing one.|$|R
500|$|At French {{television}} show Taratata Gaga appeared while <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the window of}} her limousine. She later went on the show to perform [...] "Hair", but changed her outfit once more. The recorded performance was released to her YouTube channel by Gaga. Air Productions, which produces the program Taratata, detected the posting of the video and notified YouTube of supposed copyright infringement on Gaga's part. YouTube was forced to close Gaga's official channel with the statement: [...] "YouTube ladygagaofficial account was closed, because we have received, several instances, third-party notifications informing us that many people, including the following, filed a claim for infringement of copyright: Air Productions." [...] Later, Air Productions issued a statement that the notification was sent in error, and they had asked Google and YouTube to rectify this; Gaga's account was re-opened, and Taratata apologized to the singer: [...] "Really sorry for the problem with YouTube. Everything works again!" [...] During her promotional performances of the songs from Born This Way in Taiwan, Gaga sang [...] "Hair" [...] and played the piano in a black bra, {{against the backdrop of}} many red lanterns and a red arch, a set created specially for the Taiwan show. She later explained in a press conference the inspiration behind the performance: [...] "Like the gentleman [...] just mentioned, that lantern means prosperity and it's about the future. I'm always thinking about the future of my generation and the voice of my generation when I write music." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening sequence, {{in which}} the Doctor barely hangs onto the {{crashing}} TARDIS as it flies over London, was later added to the script to bridge from the conclusion of The End of Time to the TARDIS's crash into Amy's garden. Moffat {{thought it would be}} funny if they showed him <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the TARDIS and nearly crashing into London, which would start an episode set {{in a small town in}} a big way. Moffat also referenced the scene from A.A. Milne's The House at Pooh Corner, where Tigger claims to like everything, but then proceeds to reject all food offered to him until he finally finds that he likes extract of malt. Moffat's variant had the newly regenerated Doctor reject a variety of foods, with the exception of fish fingers with custard, offered to him by the young Amy. Moffat felt that appealing to children was important to the show's success. The scene where the Doctor creates the virus using Jeff's laptop was originally set in a classroom where the Doctor used the students' computers; this was changed for production reasons. In the episode, the Doctor snaps his fingers to open the TARDIS, a trick his previous incarnation learned from River Song in [...] "Silence in the Library"/"Forest of the Dead". He also repeats the lines [...] "wibbley-wobbley, timey-wimey" [...] and [...] "some cowboys in here" [...] from the Moffat-written episodes [...] "Blink" [...] and [...] "The Girl in the Fireplace".|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Green Light", {{directed}} by Grant Singer, was filmed in Los Angeles' MacArthur Park and released on 2 March 2017. It shows Lorde {{in a small}} pink dress and sneakers dancing on a street, intercut with clips of Lorde in a club singing, Lorde in a taxi with her head <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the window and her dancing on a passerby's car. The video has garnered over 90 million views.|$|E
2500|$|... "Smile" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, with many labelling the Doctor and Bill's growing relationship {{the highlight of}} the episode. [...] "Smile" [...] holds a score of 89% on Rotten Tomatoes, the site's consensus reading [...] "Though moments verge on the ridiculous and portions are bland, [...] "Smile" [...] grows compelling, fun, and chilling when focusing on two leading characters <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> for much <b>of</b> the episode".|$|R
60|$|She {{was destined}} to learn much from the strange woman. The {{acquaintance}} had begun one day when Saxon, in the back yard, was <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> a couple <b>of</b> corset covers and several pieces of her finest undergarments. The woman leaning on the rail of her back porch, had caught her eye, and nodded, as it seemed to Saxon, half to her and half to the underlinen on the line.|$|R
60|$|With {{one hand}} the shaggy man held the apple, which he began eating, while {{with the other}} hand he pulled Toto <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his pocket and dropped him to the ground. Of course Toto made for Dorothy at once, barking joyfully at his release from the dark pocket. When the child had patted his head lovingly, he sat down before her, his red tongue <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> one side <b>of</b> his mouth, and looked up into her face with his bright brown eyes, as if asking her what they should do next.|$|R
2500|$|Chesterton usually wore a {{cape and}} a {{crumpled}} hat, with a swordstick in hand, and a cigar <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his mouth. He {{had a tendency}} to forget where {{he was supposed to be}} going and miss the train that was supposed to take him there. It is reported that on several occasions he sent a telegram to his wife Frances from some distant (and incorrect) location, writing such things as [...] "Am in Market Harborough. Where ought I to be?" [...] to which she would reply, [...] "Home". [...] (Chesterton himself tells the story, omitting, however, his wife's alleged reply, in ch. XVI of his autobiography.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The far understrength 1st and 2nd Battalions 506th PIR {{spread out}} in {{skirmish}} line in the dark {{to move through the}} hedgerows but were subjected to persistent sniper fire. They covered the twisting dirt road from Culoville to Vierville—a distance of one mile—in four hours. Pushing on beyond the town, they had moved only a thousand yards more by 1100 when a platoon of six Sherman medium tanks of Company A, 746th Tank Battalion appeared. They moved forward another mile, with Germans constantly infiltrating in behind them, before a sniper killed the commander of the 1st Battalion 506th, Lt Col. William L. Turner. Attacks to clear the flanking hedgerows were thrown back and the advance stalled. Using a newly arrived Stuart light tank as support, Company D advanced at 1830 two miles (3km) to the battalion objective, the crossroads below Saint Côme-du-Mont linking it with Carentan. However the tank was destroyed there by a direct hit, where the hull and a dead crewman <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the tank gave the intersection the nickname [...] "Dead Man's Corner". Company A followed Company D to the outskirts of Saint Côme-du-Mont, but both were recalled just before midnight when no other units could consolidate on them.|$|E

60|$|Sylvia Grant did go {{down the}} street, however. Ruggles, <b>hanging</b> halfway <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the window as usual, saw her, and called me to go and look. Of course I went. Sylvia Grant was always worth looking at. There was no girl in Frampton who could hold a candle to her {{when it came to}} beauty. As for brains, that is another thing altogether. My private opinion is that Sylvia hadn't any, or she would never have preferred--but there, I'm getting on too fast again. Ruggles should have written this story; he can {{concentrate}} better.|$|R
5000|$|Directed by Stones Throw cover artist Jeff Jank, {{the album}} artwork is drawn by Lawrence [...] "Raw Dawg" [...] Hubbard, co-founder and artist behind Los Angeles cult magazine, Real Deal Comix. The vinyl LP edition {{features}} a wrap-around drawing showing {{the front and}} back of a theater. Snoopzilla and Dâm-Funk are <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> in front <b>of</b> their low rider—a time machine, in fact—with some thuggish throw-down happening at the theater doors. On the back, there is paparazzi, drunks and prostitutes.|$|R
5|$|In the wild, {{little brown}} bats {{can be very}} active during {{the day in the}} spring months, where they can be heard loudly squeaking, {{shuffling}} position and seen <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> the bottom <b>of</b> the bat house during all hours of the daytime. The average sleep time of a little brown bat in captivity is said to be 19.9 hours per day. This long period of sleep is thought to be a way of conserving energy, by only hunting for a few hours each night when their insect prey are available.|$|R

50|$|The dulla (also spelled doula or dhula) is {{an organ}} {{in the throat}} of male {{dromedary}} camels. It is a large, inflatable sac that the male extends from his mouth as a mating display to attract females or to assert dominance. When inflated, it resembles a long, swollen, pink tongue <b>hanging</b> <b>out</b> the side <b>of</b> the camel's mouth. Inflation and protrusion of the dulla {{is often associated with}} excessive salivation and in the mating display, with foot stomping. It has been claimed the dulla is the soft palate.|$|R
25|$|The mother collapses at the funeral, {{and spends}} {{the next month}} in the {{hospital}} crippled with atypical grief. The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes {{it upon himself to}} treat her personally with psychotherapy. But it is not successful, and so when she reveals that her second greatest fear is nature, he decides to try exposure therapy. They hike to their isolated cabin in a woods called Eden, where she spent time with Nic the previous summer while writing a thesis on gynocide. He encounters a doe which shows no fear of him, and has a stillborn fawn <b>hanging</b> halfway <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her.|$|R
5000|$|The puns and [...] "silly {{pictures}} on the wall with various items <b>hanging</b> clear <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the frames" [...] was the feature that provoked the most reader mail, according to contemporary articles and interviews with Holman. The cartoonist often visited the syndicate office {{to pick up the}} puns which readers suggested for the walls. He called these items [...] "wallnuts". (Example: A picture of a fish opening a door is labeled [...] "Calling cod".) What did Holman think of all the puns? [...] "They're so stupid," [...] he sighs. [...] "I can't help it if people like 'em. Come to think of it, I love 'em, too!" ...|$|R
