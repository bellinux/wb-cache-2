Marine intercoolers take the form of a tubular heat exchanger with the air passing through a series of tubes and cooling water circulating around the tubes within the unit's casing. The source of water for the intercooler depends on the exact cooling system fitted to the engine. Most marine engines have fresh water circulating within them which is passed through a <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>cooled</b> by sea water.

50|$|A closed-cycle {{heat pump}} clothes dryer uses a heat pump to {{dehumidify}} the processing air. Such dryers typically use {{less than half}} the energy per load of a condenser dryer.Whereas condensation dryers use a passive <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>cooled</b> by ambient air, these dryers use a heat pump. The hot, humid air from the tumbler is passed through a heat pump where the cold side condenses the water vapor into either a drain pipe or a collection tank and the hot side reheats the air afterwards for re-use. In this way not only does the dryer avoid the need for ducting, but it also conserves much of its heat within the dryer instead of exhausting it into the surroundings. Heat pump dryers can therefore use up to 50% less energy required by either condensation or traditional dryers. Domestic heat pump dryers are designed to work in typical ambient temperatures from 5 to 30 °C.Below 5 °C, drying times significantly increase.|$|E
