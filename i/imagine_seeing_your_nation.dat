I only ask you to read it, and to [...] forgive me the intrusion upon you--and further to believe that I am [...] yours, with much respect.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{would like}} to put forward the claim that, {{at least in some}} central cases, visualising {{consists}} literally in <b>imagining</b> <b>seeing.</b> The first section of my paper is concerned with a defence of the specific argument for this claim that M. G. F. Martin presents in his paper 'The Transparency of Experience' (Martin 2002). This argument has been often misunderstood (or ignored), and it is worthwhile to discuss it in detail and to illus­trate what its precise nature is and why I take it to be sound. In the second section, I present a second and independent argument for the claim that visualising is <b>imagining</b> <b>seeing,</b> which is not to be found in Martin's writings, despite some crucial similarities with his own argument ‒ notably in the focus on the subjective aspects of visual experience. The last section deals with a particular objection to the idea that imagining takes perception as its direct object and says a bit more about how best to understand this claim. ...|$|R
