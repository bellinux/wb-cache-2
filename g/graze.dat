40|$|Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea) have a {{significant}} role in regulating the ecosystem services they provide on rangelands. Colonization of dung piles by dung beetles can help facilitate the decomposition of dung, control dung-breeding pests, and cycle important nutrients into the soil to improve pasture quality. Cattle are <b>grazed</b> on pastures at various stocking densities {{depending on the type of}} <b>grazing</b> practice. The influence of <b>grazing</b> practices on dung beetle communities and services remains largely unknown. Our first study investigated dung beetle activity across different cattle <b>grazing</b> practices to determine how <b>grazing</b> might influence dung beetle abundance and diversity. Dung beetle populations were monitored throughout the <b>grazing</b> season on pastures that were <b>grazed</b> under various practices: non-grazed/hay, continuous <b>grazing,</b> low-stocking rotational <b>grazing,</b> and high-stocking (mob) rotational <b>grazing.</b> Results from this study showed significantly higher dung beetle diversity on pastures exposed to rotational <b>grazing</b> practices compared to continuous <b>grazing</b> or no <b>grazing.</b> In some cases, dung beetle abundance and species richness were significantly greater on pastures that were <b>grazed</b> through high-stocking rotational <b>grazing</b> compared to low-stocking rotational or continuous <b>grazing</b> treatments. Based on these data, rotational cattle <b>grazing</b> may favor the colonization of dung beetles on rangeland, regardless of stocking density. Our second study investigated whether dung beetles exhibit preferences for dung from cattle exposed to different <b>grazing</b> practices. Dung from cattle in three separate <b>grazing</b> practices were used to test dung beetle preference: continuous <b>grazing,</b> low-stocking rotational <b>grazing,</b> and high-stocking rotational <b>grazing.</b> Dung beetle abundance was measured as well as the nutrient and physical properties of each dung type. Results of the study revealed no significant differences in dung beetle abundance between dung collected from each <b>grazing</b> practice. Nutritional content, pH, moisture, and dry matter levels also were not significantly different. However, the results indicated varying dung beetle species composition on dung from the continuous versus rotational <b>grazing</b> practices.

40|$|Patterns of <b>grazing</b> on {{individual}} crested wheatgrass plants were studied using scale maps of plant basal outlines within randomly located plots. The occurrence and extent (part of plant <b>grazed,</b> stubble height) of <b>grazing</b> on each plant was recorded on the maps at {{two and three}} day intervals throughout a <b>grazing</b> treatment. Allometric equations for estimating phytomass from plant photosynthetic volume were generated using nonlinear regression analysis. Equations were specific to year. The percent weight remaining in the stubble of a <b>grazed</b> plant was estimated using a second-order polynomial equation relating cumulative percent plant height to cumulative percent plant weight. A modified bootstrap analysis was used due to the autocorrelated nature of these data. These equations were used to estimate the percent biomass <b>grazed</b> from individual plants. The presence of standing dead culms substantially reduced the severity of <b>grazing</b> {{on individual}} crested wheatgrass plants. This effect was most pronounced for large plants. The deterrence effect of xiii standing dead culms declined as plants matured, but remained an important factor affecting <b>grazing</b> severity. The pattern of <b>grazing</b> on crested wheatgrass plants was examined under three <b>grazing</b> systems: 1) continuous season-long <b>grazing</b> (CSLG), 2) high intensity <b>grazing</b> (approximately 60 percent utilization in eight days), and 3) short duration <b>grazing.</b> For all <b>grazing</b> treatments, a lower proportion of small plants was <b>grazed</b> than medium and large. Only under CSLG were small plants <b>grazed</b> more severely than large plants. Under all ocher <b>grazing</b> treatments, medium and large plants were <b>grazed</b> as severely as small plants. The proportion of plants regrazed was low when <b>grazing</b> began at the boot phenological stage and regrowth was minimal.

The proportion of small <b>grazed</b> plants that were regrazed was much lower than the proportion of large <b>grazed</b> plants that were regrazed. The re <b>grazing</b> event, however, involved, on average, more of the previously ungrazed portion of a plant than the part which had been <b>grazed</b> before.

Heavy <b>grazing</b> significantly reduced vegetative cover and biomass yields, especially on steeper slopes.

40|$|<b>Grazing</b> by {{livestock}} has a {{great influence}} on soil characteristics with major effects on soil carbon and nitrogen cycling in <b>grazing</b> lands. <b>Grazing</b> practices affect soil properties in different ways depending on the prescribed stocking rate and <b>grazing</b> periods. The new <b>grazing</b> system of short intensive <b>grazing</b> followed by {{a long period of}} rest referred to as time-controlled <b>grazing</b> (TC <b>grazing)</b> has become popular amongst many graziers in Australia and elsewhere in the world. However, little research has been carried out on the impacts of this <b>grazing</b> system on the physical and chemical health of the soil. To address this issue, a comprehensive field study was carried out in a sheep <b>grazing</b> property of Currajong in south east region of Queensland, Australia where the two <b>grazing</b> systems of continuous and TC <b>grazing</b> were compared. Results obtained on the impact of <b>grazing</b> management on soil characteristics over a five-year period (2001 - 2006) showed an increase in soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (SON) in the areas with favorable soil condition over the study period as compared with continuous <b>grazing.</b> There was also an increase in ground litter accumulation over time and no compaction in TC <b>grazing.</b> Nitrate and extractable P concentrations were reduced by higher grass growth occurring under TC <b>grazing,</b> which in turn decreases the contamination potential for downstream water bodies.

The outcome, however, may be expected to differ between insect species. Here, we analysed the impact of different <b>grazing</b> intensities on insect communities from lowland heathlands in the Netherlands. Firstly, we use detailed data on butterfly distribution and abundances to analyse population responses of 10 butterfly species to heathland <b>grazing</b> management. Secondly, we investigated species responses to <b>grazing</b> intensity on 16 field locations across a range of insect groups (butterflies, day-active moths, grasshoppers, and ants). We hypothesized that species from early successional stages would benefit from <b>grazing</b> whereas late-successional species would suffer from <b>grazing.</b> Moreover, we expected summer <b>grazing</b> to have less beneficial effects than year-round <b>grazing.</b> Both hypotheses were largely supported by our results. Species responses to <b>grazing</b> contrasted between early and late successional species. Variation in species responses were strongly linked to <b>grazing</b> intensity and soil moisture, reflecting species-specific niches in relation to vegetation structure and microclimate.
