40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} the development of high resolution germanium detector systems for direct imaging of spent nuclear fuels and fissile materials and Compton scatter imaging of large objects of arbitrary size. A small configuration of detectors shall be assembled to demonstrate the performance of such a system. The efforts in this first year of a three year program have been focused on the design and procurement of a four detector array of germanium strip detectors. The basic detector is a 5 cm x 5 cm x 1 cm thick planar germanium detector with segmented anode and cathode. These segmentations are in the form of strips with a pitch of 2 millimeters. The strips on the anode side run orthogonal to the strips on the cathode side so that, in a gamma-ray interaction, the collection of electrons and holes on opposite electrodes produces signals which identify the interaction position in two dimensions. Each detector in the array has 25 anode contacts and 25 cathode contacts. The detector array has been designed as a planar array providing 100 square centimeters of active area mounted in a single cryostat. To reduce electronics channel count, parallel strips from adjacent detectors are electrically joined together effectively making strips that are 10 cm long. In this configuration, 100 channels of electronics are required to readout the array. In a related project, the authors are investigating processes to produce improved contacts for germanium strip detectors which would offer both more reliable extended use and the potential for finer strip pitch or position resolution. Investigating amorphous contacts, they have, to <b>date,</b> <b>prepared</b> two Ge test detectors. One was produced using n-type Ge and the other p-type Ge. The p-type detector has a Li diffused contact on one side while the n-type detector has a B ion-implanted contact. Amorphous contacts have been formed {{on the opposite side of}} each detector by RF sputtering. They are currently conducting a series of leakage current versus operating temperature measurements in order to determine the barrier heights of the amorphous contacts. The use of n and p type detectors will allow us to measure the electron and hole blocking behavior of the contacts respectively. This will provide important information on the nature of these contacts and will determine if double-sided strip detectors can be produced using only amorphous contacts. ...|$|E
40|$|Our {{department}} {{established a}} bone bank using autolyzed, antigen extracted, allogeneic bone (AAA bone) {{in which the}} immunogenicity is markedly reduced by chemical treatment, and has started its clinical application to reconstruction of bone defects. An outline of the bone bank and the clinical results are reported. The graft used AAA bone prepared by chemically treating (e. g. decalcification using hydrochloric acid) cortical bone of human long tubular bones of {{the upper and lower}} limbs. In 1994, we first decided to transport AAA bone from the Federal Republic Germany to Japan for clinical application. We also recruited domestic donors by asking neighboring hospitals to provide excess bone fragments resected in plastic surgery of the jaw and lower limbs amputated from severely diabetic patients due to peripheral necrosis. These procedures were carried out with the approval by the Safety Measures Division, Drug Safety Bureau, Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Ethical Committee of our University. The donors were selected according to the donor qualification criteria of the Japan Orthopedic Society and with sufficient precaution against infection of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Four limbs (of 4 patients) have been provided to <b>date,</b> <b>prepared</b> into AAA bone by chemical treatments at our department, and used clinically. AAA bone implantation has been made in 16 patients to date. They were 12 males and 4 females aged 15 to 65 years. Their diseases were mandibular cysts in 13, odontoma in 1, fracture of the mandible in 1, and malignant tumor of the mandible in 1. Postoperative panoramic radiograms were obtained in 6 patients with mandibular cysts 2 years or longer after surgery, and the state of bone formation at the implantation site was observed. The oral cavity was also examined for abnormalities, and the percent efficacy was calculated from the results of both examinations. The usefulness rating was very useful in 4 and useful in 3, with a percent efficacy of 100 %. The results were satisfactory also in patients followed up for a shorter period after surgery. AAA bone was removed due to infection in only 1 patient, but none of the recipients developed a serious complication. The maximum followed-up period to date is 4 years and 7 months. The postoperative course has been uneventful in all patients, with none showing abnormalities. From these results, AAA bone is considered to have the following merits: (1) By sterilization with EO gas and vacuum packing after preparation, AAA bone can be preserved at room temperature, be used at any time, and is easy to handle. (2) It is highly plastic and can be readily adjusted to various forms during surgery. (3) Implanted AAA bone is completely replaced by the recipient bone. (4) The degree of bone formation at the implantation site can be easily evaluated by radiography...|$|E

Content of total phenolics, flavonoids and carotenoids contents were determined spectrophotometrically. Polyphenols composition was examined using HPLC. Seven phenolic compounds (catechin, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, syringic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and sinapic acid) were detected in all date syrup extracts. p-Coumaric acid was the major compound of all date syrup extracts, representing 49. 223 - 63. 397 %. The antioxidant activity of date syrup was evaluated by various antioxidant assays, including total antioxidant, DPPH scavenging test, FRAP, hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity and metal chelating activity. Results showed that the <b>date</b> syrup <b>prepared</b> after extraction with pectinase and cellulase mixture gave the lowest phenolic and flavonoid contents.
