Where the figures can be checked, for example against the financial records of the king's officials in charge of dissolving monasteries in the later 1530s, they are shown to be broadly accurate though on the low side, in some cases {{by as much as}} 15%. There is, particularly in the north, a tendency to underestimate the value of some important classes of asset, especially agricultural land held in desmesne and woodland with standing timber. One theory to account for this is the natural tendency of taxpayers to make conservative estimates combined with the rushed nature of the work, which encouraged the commissioners to give the benefit of the doubt. Standing timber moreover, by its nature, provides a resource of occasional <b>exceptional</b> <b>income,</b> rather than a steady annual income stream, and hence was commonly ignored in income assessments for 16th century inventories of landed assets.|$|R

60|$|When {{that problem}} is at last faced, the {{question}} of the proportion in which the national income shall be distributed can have only one answer. All our shares must be equal. It has always been so; it always will be so. It is true that the incomes of robbers vary considerably from individual to individual; and the variation is reflected in the incomes of their parasites. The commercialization of certain exceptional talents has also produced <b>exceptional</b> <b>incomes,</b> direct and derivative. Persons who live on rent of land and capital are economically, though not legally, in the category of robbers, and have grotesquely different incomes. But in the huge mass of mankind variation Of income from individual to individual is unknown, because it is ridiculously impracticable. As a device for persuading a carpenter that a judge is a creature of superior nature to himself, to be deferred and submitted to even to the death, we may give a carpenter a hundred pounds a year and a judge five thousand; but the wage for one carpenter is the wage for all the carpenters: the salary for one judge is the salary for all the judges.|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} view of {{the political}} economy of public debt is that myopic and unconstrained politicians prefer to disregard intertemporal smoothing considerations and extract political rents as fast as possible. From this perspective, it seems that the world has much to celebrate, as most emerging market economies [...] often suspect of having weak political institutions [...] have chosen to save rather than waste most of their <b>exceptional</b> <b>income</b> from high commodity prices. Unfortunately, the optimistic conclusion that these countries may have turned the corner with respect to public resource management may be premature. In this paper we show that {{while it is true that}} in the long run there is a negative connection between the level of public debt and the quality of political institutions, this needs not be the case in the short run. Quite the opposite, in the short run, governments with weak political institutions are likely to save more than governments with better institutions facing the same uncertainty. This is due to an option value of rent-seeking whereby the prospect of potentially squandering funds in the future makes governments more "precautionary" today. We show that this result relies on three assumptions: Economic risk is high relative to political risk, markets are sufficiently incomplete, and there exists a rent-less policy-making regime. ...|$|R

40|$|A person's {{income is}} {{generally}} explained {{as a function}} of human capital variables and variables that measure the strength or structure of the economy. Income is usually studied as a variable dependent on education, union involvement, the income of others, and experience. Regional breakdowns of income in the United States, however, show significant variations in regional wages that may not be accounted for in traditional wage equations. This paper explores the determinants of income {{in each of the four}} U. S. Census regions to determine if significant differences exist and to account for the structural and regional causes of such differences. The results could have significant ramifications for policy makers and businessmen. This paper creates a regional income model to be evaluated using both OLS and neural networks. Results from OLS and the Cotton-Neumark decomposition method are compared with those of neural network to evaluate the advantages in methodology. Clearly, some of the variations in regional wages are due to differences in the variables making up the wage equations. Other variations, or residual differences, can be summed up as the regional coefficient that explains regional peculiarities in wage determination. To improve and extend the analysis, the data are also evaluated by a forward-feeding back-propagating neural network. Neural networks offer a significant advantage through their ability to determine the relationship between variables using only input and output data. Non-linear relationships can be modeled with neural networks, accounting for variation in behavior that could not accurately be modeled linearly. The networks will be run in two modes: prediction and classification. In the prediction mode, the neural network is directly analogous to the traditional economic model using OLS. As with the OLS regression, the network is run both with and without the regional dummy variables to measure the influence of a county's location. The neural network results are compared to OLS through R values between the predicted and actual values. Correlation values for various neural networks are in the range of. 90 to. 95, with <b>exceptional</b> <b>income</b> prediction in low and middle income counties. In the classification mode, the network interprets the county data, including income, and assigns each county to one of the four census regions. How accurately the network assigns counties their known regions illuminates the regional differences. Success is measured through several means. ...|$|R

30|$|According to Table  9, even {{countries}} {{without a}} balanced income distribution {{can still be}} efficient (e.g., DK and GB), or vice versa, inefficient countries can have balanced <b>incomes</b> (such as <b>H</b> and M). Similarly, there are countries which are efficient as well as balanced (EST, FIN, L, NL, and S) and, on the other hand, those that have a high inefficiency with very unequal incomes (e.g., GR, LV, and RO). When comparing column 3 of Table  9 with column 3 of Table  4, we find that countries with a (CCR) income balance of below 70 % (E 0.56, GR 0.66, LV 0.65, and RO 0.68) have an 80 / 20 ratio of more than 600 % (E 7.16, GR 6.62, LV 6.57, and RO 6.37).

Americans at the bottom of the income distribution work longer hours than their counterparts in other rich countries but nonetheless achieve a relative standard of living that is below that enjoyed by working-age adults in other countries who hold a comparable position in their national income distributions. U. S. household heads responsible for rearing children are unusually time constrained. Parents in the middle and top part of the U.

This has resulted in the movement of human capital between different tax jurisdictions and an increase in expatriates all across the world. The focus of the study is to expand on the current knowledge on the taxation of inbound expatriates working within South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Nigeria, as the world has turned its focus on Africa in terms of investment and expansion, as supported by Shelley (2004 : 3), and to provide both employers and employees with knowledge of the different tax regimes (source-based taxation and residence-based taxation) found in some of the emerging and fastest growing markets in Africa: namely Botswana, Namibia, Nigeria and South Africa. It was found that the African tax landscape provides for a vast range of tax systems, of which, most are either residence–based or source-based. The tax systems of South Africa and Nigeria are similar in that they are residence-based. In each of these two countries, tax residents are taxed on their worldwide income, while non-residents are only taxed on income from specific sources. Therefore, residency is an essential concept in each of these tax systems. The above-mentioned countries, however, apply different methods and factors in determining the concept of residency. As a result of the difference in determining tax residency and differences in their domestic income tax legislations, the taxability of income earned abroad differs in these countries. The tax systems of Botswana and Namibia are similar in that they are source-based. In each of these countries, income is taxable when it is from a source or deemed source within these countries. Although in <b>exceptional</b> circumstances, some <b>income</b> which is not from a source within these countries may be taxable, relief is applied in terms of the domestic legislation, in order to lessen the burden of tax. Source is therefore a vital concept in each of these tax systems. The definition and application of the term source is different in both countries. However, similarities are found in that the source is primarily where the services were physically rendered. Both employers and employees should consider the basis of taxation (source basis and residence basis) that is applied by the prospective host country when making a decision regarding an assignment to a foreign country as this forms a major factor in how their income (both local and foreign) will be treated.

S.) are an invisible group {{that is capable of}} tremendous influence during their time in the U. S. and upon returning to their home countries. The prospect of empowering them to exercise leadership has potentially important implications on future economic, food, environmental, and world security issues. This thesis sheds light on contemporary development issues regarding gender inequality in the Middle East and brings religious and cultural factors causing friction in the global security context to the forefront of not only academia and scholarly discussion but also public awareness. It is based on a phenomenological qualitative study of the wives of Ph. D. students from the Middle East at TAMU. It illuminates the challenges the wives face {{as a result of the}} overwhelming shift from war torn home countries to a democratic society. Ten challenges were identified: a) Language Barrier, b) Affordable Childcare, c) Identity, d) Healthcare, e) Education, f) No <b>Income,</b> g) Transportation, <b>h)</b> Entertainment, i) Halaal Foods, and j) Religious Imposition and other latent issues. Contemporary development issues in gender inequality identified in this research serve as the foundation for a practical application course designed by a joint effort of the Bush School of Government and Public Service and the Department of Agricultural Leadership, Education, and Communications (ALEC) for graduate students interested in development careers. In the course, students will assess the challenges facing Middle Eastern wives of Ph. D. students at TAMU and propose solutions to remedy these challenges by empowering these women, within their cultural limitations. The intent of this research is to pave the way for several capstone courses where informed students will find plausible solutions for the challenges that emerge from this research. The need for such courses is evident because there are few capstone courses offered in development work at the Bush School and ALEC. The importance and emphasis of these courses will be in identifying local issues with international scope, where students will gain experience in understanding and addressing cultural challenges. This research will have great impact and utility within academia by producing successful evidence-based programs for a more peaceful and prosperous world...|$|R
