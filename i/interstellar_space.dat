5|$|After {{taking the}} Family Portrait series of images, which {{included}} Pale Blue Dot, NASA mission managers commanded Voyager 1 to power its cameras down, as the spacecraft {{was not going}} to fly near anything else of significance for the rest of its mission, while other instruments that were still collecting data needed power for the long journey to <b>interstellar</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>Interstellar</b> <b>space</b> is the {{physical}} space within a galaxy beyond {{the influence of}} each star on the plasma. The contents of <b>interstellar</b> <b>space</b> are called the interstellar medium. Approximately 70% {{of the mass of}} the interstellar medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms; most of the remainder consists of helium atoms. This is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through stellar nucleosynthesis. These atoms are ejected into the interstellar medium by stellar winds or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a planetary nebula. The cataclysmic explosion of a supernova will generate an expanding shock wave consisting of ejected materials. The density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably: the average is around 106 particles per m3, but cold molecular clouds can hold 108–1012 per m3.|$|E
5|$|The outer {{boundary}} of the heliosphere, the heliopause, is {{the point at which}} the solar wind finally terminates and is the beginning of <b>interstellar</b> <b>space.</b> Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are reported to have passed the termination shock and entered the heliosheath, at 94 and 84AU from the Sun, respectively. Voyager 1 is reported to have crossed the heliopause in August 2012.|$|E
5|$|According to Freitas, {{direct contact}} with civilizations {{significantly}} more advanced than humanity {{would have to take}} place within the Solar System, as only the more advanced society would have the resources and technology to cross <b>interstellar</b> <b>space.</b> Consequently, such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular interstellar travel. Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.|$|E

40|$|Most astronomers {{believe that}} the {{universe}} began about 15 billion years ago when an explosion led to its expansion and cooling. The present state of the universe compels us to {{believe that the}} universe was extremely hot and dense in its infancy. In the beginning there was intense radiation. The photons produced equal amounts of matter and antimatter and a plasma soup of particles and antiparticles was present. Plasma is the first state of matter from which all the other states originated. This book discusses the diversity of cosmic and terrestrial plasmas found in the early universe, galactic and intergalactic media, stellar atmospheres, <b>interstellar</b> <b>spaces,</b> the solar system and the Earth's ionosphere, and their observability with the most recent telescopes such as the Chandra X-ray telescope and gamma ray telescopes.

5|$|In 2013, Dwayne Heard at the University of Leeds {{suggested}} that quantum mechanical tunneling could explain a reaction his group observed taking place, at {{a significantly higher}} than expected rate, between cold (around 63 kelvins) hydroxyl and methanol molecules, apparently bypassing intramolecular energy barriers which {{would have to be}} overcome by thermal energy or ionization events for the same rate to exist at warmer temperatures. The proposed tunneling mechanism may help explain the common observation of fairly complex molecules (up to tens of atoms) in <b>interstellar</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that this collision will disrupt the orbits of the planets in the Solar System. Although {{it is true that}} the gravity of passing stars can detach planets into <b>interstellar</b> <b>space,</b> distances between stars are so great that the likelihood of the Milky Way–Andromeda collision causing such disruption to any individual star system is negligible. Although the Solar System as a whole could be affected by these events, the Sun and planets are not expected to be disturbed.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{announced}} in June 2012 that the probe was detecting {{changes in the}} environment that were suspected to correlate with arrival at the heliopause. Voyager 1 had reported a marked increase in its detection of charged particles from <b>interstellar</b> <b>space,</b> which are normally deflected by the solar winds within the heliosphere from the Sun. The craft thus began to enter the interstellar medium {{at the edge of}} the Solar System.|$|E

40|$|If {{cosmic rays}} are of extragalactic origin, {{they must be}} {{partially}} absorbed by the gas and dust clouds which populate the <b>interstellar</b> <b>spaces.</b> This absorption will produce directional asymmetries in {{the intensity of the}} cosmic rays because of our eccentric location relative to the Milky Way. In addition to the straight absorption of energy a part of the cosmic rays will be scattered by interstellar matter without appreciable loss in total energy. Such scattering includes the formation of energetic secondaries and therefore tends to produce a change in the numbers and physical characteristics of the various constituents of the cosmic rays. Again, because of the segregating action of the earth's magnetic field, directional asymmetries will result. Although the effects to be expected are in all probability small it seems that modern instruments are sufficiently sensitive to make possible the detection of the before-mentioned asymmetries. Positive results of a search for absorption effects might furnish new information on (1) Whether or not cosmic rays are of extragalactic origin. (2) The problem of the total amount of interstellar matter. (3) The analysis of the composition of cosmic rays...|$|R
5|$|Outer space, also simply called space, {{refers to}} the {{relatively}} empty regions of the universe outside the atmospheres of celestial bodies. Outer space is used to distinguish it from airspace (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude.

40|$|Dusty plasmas are {{ubiquitous}} in low-temperature laboratory discharges {{as well as}} in the near-earth environment, planetary rings, and <b>interstellar</b> <b>spaces.</b> In this paper, updated knowledge of fundamentals of collective dust-plasma interactions and several novel phenomena are presented that have been observed in laboratories and in space dusty plasmas. Mechanisms that are responsible for the charging of dust grains are discussed, and the fact that the dust charge perturbation is a new dynamical variable in a dusty plasma. The underlying physics of different forces that act on a charged dust grain is reviewed. In dusty plasmas, there are new attractive forces (e. g., due to wakefield and ion focusing effects and dipole-dipole interactions between unevenly charged dust rods). Furthermore, in the presence of an ensemble of charged dust grains, there are collective dust-plasma interactions featuring new waves (e. g., the dust acoustic wave, the dust ion-acoustic wave, the dust lattice wave, etc.), new instabilities, and coherent nonlinear structures (dust acoustic and dust ion-acoustic shocks, dust voids, and dust vortices), which are also discussed. Theoretical models for numerous collective dust-plasma interactions are compared with existing observations from laboratories and space environments...|$|R

5|$|The {{point at}} which the Solar System ends and <b>interstellar</b> <b>space</b> begins is not {{precisely}} defined because its outer boundaries are shaped by two separate forces: the solar wind and the Sun's gravity. The limit of the solar wind's influence is roughly four times Pluto's distance from the Sun; this heliopause, the outer boundary of the heliosphere, is considered the beginning of the interstellar medium. The Sun's Hill sphere, the effective range of its gravitational dominance, is thought to extend up to a thousand times farther and encompasses the theorized Oort cloud.|$|E

The early encounters and historic culture of familiar Star Trek franchise races, such as the Vulcans, Andorians, Klingons, Romulans, Tholians, Borg, and Tellarites, are also explored further. The season ends with a cliffhanger that sets up the Xindi story arc, set in the Delphic Expanse, of the third season.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{molecules}} exist in <b>interstellar</b> <b>space,</b> as can tiny 0.1μm dust particles. The tally of molecules discovered through radio astronomy is steadily increasing {{at the rate}} of about four new species per year. Large regions of higher density matter known as molecular clouds allow chemical reactions to occur, including the formation of organic polyatomic species. Much of this chemistry is driven by collisions. Energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold, dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium, resulting, for example, in the trihydrogen cation. An ionized helium atom can then split relatively abundant carbon monoxide to produce ionized carbon, which in turn can lead to organic chemical reactions.|$|E
