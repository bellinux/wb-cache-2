A coordinate transformation is used to map a deformed crystal back to geometrically undeformed structure with deformed crystal potential. The single-particle Schrödinger equation is solved in the undeformed coordinates using <b>envelope</b> <b>function</b> expansion, wherein electronic wavefunctions are written in terms of strain-parametrized Bloch functions modulated by slowly varying <b>envelope</b> <b>functions.</b> Adopting local approximation of electronic structure, the unknown crystal potential in Schrödinger equation can {{be replaced by the}} strain-parametrized Bloch functions and the associated strain-parametrized energy eigenvalues, which can be constructed from unit-cell level ab initio or semi-empirical calculations of homogeneously deformed crystals at a chosen crystal momentum. The Schrödinger equation is then transformed into a coupled differential equation for the <b>envelope</b> <b>functions</b> and solved as a generalized matrix eigenvector problem. As the <b>envelope</b> <b>functions</b> are slowly varying, coarse spatial or Fourier grid can be used to represent the <b>envelope</b> <b>functions,</b> enabling the method to treat relatively large systems.
