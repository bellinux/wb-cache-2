50|$|The first purpose, I recall, {{was to try}} to {{make the}} tapes that they found more understandable. But before very long they found out that there was an 18-minute gap in one of the tapes, and that's what the panel focused on. What we were able to do was verify which {{machines}} had made the recordings and which had been used to erase the recordings. The recordings were made on a Sony Model 800B, a little consumer kind of machine... it ran 15/16ths inches per second, and Nixon's staff had attached a sound-activated start and stop feature. And the Secret Service came through every evening and put new roll of tape on it if it had run out of tape. The machine that was used in the erasure was an Uher 5000, a commonly used German dictation recorder. What we could establish was that you can hear the clicks where the machine's been put in and out of recording mode. And we could establish that the clicks were in fact from going in and out of recording. We could say that the likelihood that it was done accidentally was incredibly remote. The <b>erasing</b> <b>machine</b> was put in and out of recording mode six times, so judge for yourself how likely that was to have been accidental.|$|E
50|$|In {{an episode}} of the TV series Seinfeld, George is {{astonished}} {{to find that the}} Frogger machine he played as a teen still retains his high score. With the owners wanting to get rid of it, George decides to keep the machine for posterity, the catch being that he has to move the game without unplugging it, because if he unplugs the game the high score will be <b>erased.</b> Unfortunately the <b>machine</b> is destroyed when he unsuccessfully tries to move it across the street in a spoof of the gameplay.|$|R
500|$|Series co-creator Larry David co-wrote {{the episode}} with Seinfeld in two days, as, with the {{cancellation}} of [...] "The Bet", they had little time to write the script. George's storyline was largely based on David's personal experiences of leaving phone messages to women that would {{mean the end of}} a relationship. David had previously written a sketch for Saturday Night Live regarding a man who went into his girlfriend's house to <b>erase</b> her answering <b>machine.</b> The sketch was never produced, allowing David to use its storyline for the Seinfeld episode. Jerry's storyline was based on Seinfeld's own predicaments, as he extremely disliked the cotton Dockers commercial discussed in the episode.|$|R
5000|$|Upon gaining {{sufficient}} power, Renya {{travels to}} the Netherworld with Lilliel, having placed the Fate Revolution Circuit into himself {{rather than the other}} way around. While he is fighting, Mysiel, the angel who created the Fate Revolution Circuit and uploaded herself into the <b>machine,</b> <b>erases</b> most of his memories to increase his power levels. Ultimately, Renya is able to fight and defeat Satanael, but the [...] "overclocking" [...] causes him to perish. Lilliel sacrifices her angel powers in order to bring him back to life, although the Creator remarks that he could have easily saved Renya even if Lilliel did not. Renya and Lilliel settle down on Earth to live a normal human life, with both of them having lost all their special powers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For {{implementing}} on-line programming of Freescale HCS 12 series MCU, {{designing a}} common downloading programmer which functions include chip selection, erase and write operations. Designing a database where Freescale HCS 12 MCU Flash difference parameter values placed, so achieving HCS 12 MCU family online programming versatility. <b>Erase</b> and write <b>machine</b> codes {{are provided in}} the RAM area of Flash memory, these codes will be run at high voltage, these codes are relocated from Flash to RAM area for improving flash operation stability during the high voltage. According to BDM communication theory, we have developed a separate BDM serial communication program, the target device only receives the user code from the programmer, programmer does not need send opcode and the address information, not waiting for a command, so, increasing the erase and write speed. the programmer has the versatility and easily using...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—For {{experiments}} to be reproducible, {{it is important}} to have a known and controlled environment. This requires isolation from the surroundings. For security experiments, e. g. with hostile software, this is even more important as the experiment can affect the environment in adverse ways. In a normal campus laboratory, isolation can be achieved by network separation. For an online environment, where remote access is essential, full separation is not possible, and therefore the security implications must be carefully considered. In this paper, a way to enable remote experiments is described, where users are given full control over the computer installation. Automating the install procedure and dynamically creating isolated experiment networks provide remote users with the tools needed to do experiments in a reproducible and secure environment. The installation is done by automatically installing prepared clone images, which contains a hard drive representation, to the machines own hard drive. When an experiment starts, the machines in the experiment are automatically booted and placed on an isolated (switched) network. This way experiments are isolated from each other. By using firewall techniques, connections from outside the laboratory can only be made from the user’s machine into his/her experiment. When an experiment is done, all data are <b>erased</b> from the <b>machine’s</b> hard drive...|$|R
