40|$|ABSTRACT: Snow {{avalanches}} {{are generally}} rare and occasionally extreme events. In the general con-text of prediction and predictably of extreme events, we will examine whether snow avalanches are pre-dictable {{based on a}} few examples of forecasts at different scales. Clearly, avalanche predictability de-pends on scale. When the regional avalanche danger is High or Very High (Extreme), an avalanche is likely somewhere in the region. However, even at such high <b>danger</b> <b>levels,</b> the release probability in a single avalanche path is well below 50 % (typically on the order of 1 - 10 %). This means that a single ava-lanche is a rare event, which is not predictable even when higher <b>danger</b> <b>levels</b> prevail. At the lower dan-ger levels – relevant for backcountry recreation – the release probability is significantly lower. The low release probability {{does not mean that the}} risk is low. Even with low occurrence probability the risk might be too high to be acceptable so that comprehensive preventive measures are required...|$|R
