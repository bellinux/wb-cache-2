5|$|After {{weeks of}} secret {{negotiations}} between merchants and protest leaders, an agreement was <b>finally</b> <b>reached</b> {{during the first}} week of May. According to the agreement, small, selected groups of African Americans would order food at the downtown lunch counters on a day known in advance to the merchants. The merchants would prepare their employees for the event and instruct them to serve the customers without trouble. This arrangement would continue in a controlled manner for a couple of weeks and then all controls would be taken off, at which point the merchants and protest leaders would reconvene to evaluate the results. Also as part of the agreement, the media was to be informed of the settlement and requested to provide only accurate, non-sensational coverage.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{reforming}} actions such as the Bill of Middlesex, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative and resistant to King's Bench changes because of the impact they had on {{the business of the}} Common Pleas. This was best emphasised by Slade's Case, a struggle between the old and new forms of suing for breach of contract; although an equilibrium between the common law courts was <b>finally</b> <b>reached,</b> it eventually led to their dissolution with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, and merger into a single High Court of Justice.|$|E

Oka's troops assaulted all along an east-west saddle ridge held by Hanneken's battalion but concentrated particularly on Hanneken's Company F, which defended the extreme left {{flank of the}} Marine positions on the ridge. A Company F machine gun section under Mitchell Paige killed many of the Japanese attackers, but Japanese fire eventually killed or injured almost all the Marine machine gunners. At 05:00, Oka's 3rd Battalion, 4th Infantry succeeded in scaling the steep slope of the ridge and pushed the surviving members of Company F off the crest.|$|E
5|$|In 1943 {{the fragile}} {{relations}} between the Soviet Union and the Polish government-in-exile <b>finally</b> <b>reached</b> their breaking point when, on April 13, the Germans announced via the Katyn Commission {{the discovery of the}} bodies of 20,000 Polish officers who had been murdered by the Soviets and buried in Katyn Forest, near Smolensk, Russia. Stalin claimed that the atrocity had been carried out by the Germans, while Nazi propaganda orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels successfully exploited the Katyn massacre to drive a wedge between Poland, the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, and subsequently Russia, did not acknowledge responsibility for this and similar massacres of Polish officers until the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, Jane Addams and Smith had a {{disagreement}} over Hull House's Sunday concerts. Smith, a classically trained musician, {{felt that the}} purpose of the events should be to present educationally challenging programs. Addams, felt that the programs should feature more popular music to promote Hull House and recruit broad audiences to experience the environment which the settlement house offered. A compromise was <b>finally</b> <b>reached</b> at the turn of the decade, with Sunday concerts featuring music which had a more popular appeal, and weekday evening programs focusing on more challenging material. The disagreement over content was serious enough to lead to Smith's resignation in 1901. Though Addams did not relent on the Sunday content, she was able to persuade Smith to remain.|$|E

5|$|In the whaleboat, Melville had, like De Long, ridden out {{the storm}} {{by means of a}} sea anchor. The boat's course was far to the south of De Long's; they <b>finally</b> <b>reached</b> land at one of the main mouths of the Lena, and were able to {{navigate}} upriver. Within a few days they encountered a native fishing camp, and by September 25 had reached the settlement of Arrhu. Chipp's cutter never reached land; overwhelmed by the storm, it presumably foundered, with the loss of all eight on board.|$|E
5|$|Johnson scored another 14 {{goals for}} Ipswich {{on the way}} to a third-place finish in the league in 1998–99, but again they lost out in the {{play-off}} semi-finals, this time losing to Bolton Wanderers on away goals. However, it was not the same story the following year; after three consecutive play-off semi-final defeats in 1996–97, 1997–98 and 1998–99, Ipswich <b>finally</b> <b>reached</b> the final in 1999–2000 with a 7–5 aggregate win over Bolton, before beating Barnsley 4–2 in the final at Wembley Stadium. After scoring 22 goals in 44 league games in 1999–2000, Johnson was awarded with a new, four-year contract with Ipswich.|$|E
5|$|Though ancient {{rules of}} {{hospitality}} had protected the expedition, {{they knew that}} once {{they were out of}} the Emir's lands, the Anglo-Russian forces as well as the marauding tribesmen of Persia would chase them mercilessly. The party split up into several groups, each independently making its way back to Germany. Niedermayer headed west, attempting to run the Anglo-Russian Cordon and escape through Persia, while von Hentig made for the route over the Pamir Mountains towards Chinese Central Asia. Having served in Peking before the war, von Hentig was familiar with the region and planned to make Yarkand a base from which to make a last attempt to create local Muslim unrest against Anglo-Russian interests in the region. He later escaped over the Hindu Kush, avoiding his pursuers for 130 days {{as he made his way}} on foot and horseback through Chinese Turkestan, over the Gobi Desert, and through China and Shanghai. From there, he stowed away on an American vessel to Honolulu. Following the American declaration of war, he was exchanged as a diplomat. Travelling via San Francisco, Halifax, and Bergen, he <b>finally</b> <b>reached</b> Berlin on 9 June 1917. Meanwhile, Niedermayer escaped towards Persia through Russian Turkestan. Robbed and left for dead, a wounded Niedermayer was at times reduced to begging before he <b>finally</b> <b>reached</b> friendly lines, arriving in Tehran on 20 July 1916. Wagner left Herat on 25 October 1917, making his way through northern Persia to reach Turkey on 30 January 1918. At Chorasan, he tried to rally Persian democratic and nationalist leaders, who promised to raise an army of 12,000 if Germany provided military assistance.|$|E

5|$|With the Ottomans' hold on Constantinople {{de facto}} {{recognized}} by Europe's lack of action, the Ottomans {{went on to}} facilitate further conquests in Europe and in the Middle East. Their power <b>finally</b> <b>reached</b> a peak in the mid 17th century. Their success through the Janissaries became their new weakness; conservative and extremely powerful, Ottoman reform was difficult to implement whilst European armies became increasingly more resourceful and modernized. As a result, Russian and Austrian attempts to contain the Ottoman threat {{became more and more}} a formality until the official dissolution of the Empire after World War I.|$|E
5|$|After {{making her}} way across the Atlantic independently, Empire Wildebeeste arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 25 June. After making {{intermediate}} stops in Baltimore and Hampton Roads, she sailed for Halifax with a load of scrap iron on 17 July, reaching her destination three days later. She departed in convoy HX 140 on 22 July and arrived at Belfast Lough on 5 August and Newport on 8 August. After arriving at Milford Haven on 25 August, she sailed from there two days later in convoy ON 10 for Halifax, where she arrived on 13 September. From there, Empire Wildebeeste sailed to Montreal and back to Halifax by 5 October. She departed Halifax that same day {{as a part of}} convoy HX 153, but had unspecified problems that caused her to drop out and put in at St. John's, Newfoundland, on 11 October. After aborted attempts to sail east in convoys SC 50 and SC 52, Empire Wildebeeste <b>finally</b> <b>reached</b> Loch Ewe on 25 November as a part of convoy SC 54 and Methil on 30 November.|$|E
5|$|All {{the other}} Channel Islands raids were less successful. In January 1943, Operation Huckabuck, {{a raid on}} Herm, was a failure. After three {{attempts}} to scale the islands cliffs the Commandos <b>finally</b> <b>reached</b> the top, {{but there were no}} signs of any German occupation troops or of the island's population. The next raids were Operations Hardtack 28 and Hardtack 7 in December 1943. The Hardtack 28 raid on Jersey ended in failure when two men were killed and one wounded after they walked into a minefield. The exploding mines alerted the German garrison and the Commandos had to abandon the operation. In Hardtack 7 the Commandos had returned to Sark, but had to abandon the operation and return to England when they were unable to scale the island's cliffs.|$|E

By June, 1814 the company had launched its first steamboat, the Enterprise, and Israel Gregg was her first captain. The first leg of Israel Gregg's initial Ohio River voyage as a steamboat captain was performed with the current of the Monongahela River from Brownsville to Pittsburgh. Then Gregg navigated the Enterprise with the current of the Ohio River from Pittsburgh to Cincinnati, <b>finally</b> <b>reaching</b> Louisville, Kentucky. From Louisville, Gregg commanded the Enterprise against the current of the Ohio River, <b>finally</b> <b>reaching</b> Pittsburgh. From Pittsburgh the Enterprise returned to Louisville, then steamed homeward against the river's current to Cincinnati, Steubenville, Pittsburgh, and <b>finally</b> <b>reaching</b> Brownsville on December 11, 1814.|$|R
