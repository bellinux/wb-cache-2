25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E
2500|$|Dear {{brothers}} and sisters, we are saddened {{at the death}} of our beloved Pope John Paul I, and so the cardinals {{have called for a}} new bishop of Rome. They called him from a faraway land—far and yet always close because of our communion in faith and Christian traditions. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> accept that responsibility, yet I do so in a spirit of obedience to the Lord and total faithfulness to Mary, our most Holy Mother. I am speaking to you in your—no, our Italian language. If I make a mistake, please [...] 'corrict' [...] me ....|$|E
2500|$|Her {{career began}} with blackface comedy at local clubs; {{this was the}} [...] "entertainment" [...] of which her mother had disapproved, however these {{performances}} landed Baker an opportunity to tour in Paris, which would become the place she called home until her final days. In the United States, Baker was often faced with rejection due to her race: [...] "One day I realized I {{was living in a}} country where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> be black. It was only a country for white people. Not black. So I left. I had been suffocating in the United States.... A lot of us left, not because we wanted to leave, but because we couldn't stand it anymore.... I felt liberated in Paris." ...|$|E

Take me with you, dear one. It <b>is</b> because <b>I</b> love that I ask this!" ...|$|R
2500|$|An area of {{questioning}} involved {{the book of}} Genesis, including questions such as if Eve was actually created from Adam's rib, where did Cain get his wife, {{and how many people}} lived in Ancient Egypt. Darrow used these examples to suggest that the stories of the Bible could not be scientific and should not be used in teaching science with Darrow telling Bryan, [...] "You insult every man of science and learning in the world because he does not believe in your fool religion." [...] Bryan's declaration in response was, [...] "The reason I am answering is not {{for the benefit of the}} superior court. It is to keep these gentlemen from saying <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> meet them and let them question me, and I want the Christian world to know that any atheist, agnostic, unbeliever, can question me anytime as to my belief in God, and I will answer him." ...|$|E
