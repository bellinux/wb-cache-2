40|$|Governance {{to support}} {{sustainable}} development {{always seems to}} encounter the same difficulties. The chances of successful governance increase when <b>governance</b> <b>arrangements</b> are better tuned to the environment that it tries to change.

50|$|As {{a part of}} the CWS-CRS merger, new {{governance}} arrangements were designed with the 'independent societies' becoming part owners of the new Group and their representatives were elected to the group's national board. The largest change, however was the much stronger representation for the individual members of the retailing operation with a string of regional boards and area committees designed to facilitate a clear democracy and representation on a local and national level. The composite nature of the Co-op as both a primary and a secondary co-operative led to the business having both individual members and corporate members (independent co-operative societies) which had to be included in any democratic structure. This led to a <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement</b> which was complicated and not understood by many individual members and which led to relatively few members becoming democratically engaged with the business. During 2007 the then chief executive Martin Beaumont was critical of the lack of commercial expertise on the board, foreshadowing the conclusions drawn from later Myners review into the near failure of the business during 2013 which was (in part) due to an unfit <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement.</b> In 2014 the {{governance arrangements}} were completely redesigned to reflect the recommendations of the Myners review - for more information see the governance section.|$|E

This could be likened to English local, county and national government, where society members stood for election and if successful were expected to represent members {{at all levels of}} the society, simultaneously, with positions held in on co-op committees corresponding to departments (the businesses boards), the cabinet (the national Board), devolved nations and regions(Regional Boards), counties and parish councils (Area Committees), plus doing press events and engaging with neighbourshoods and communities such as a highly paid professional member a national government might face: Quite a task for volunteer laypeople.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The {{concept of}} risk {{governance}} is successfully put upon {{the scientific and}} political agenda. However, this debate remains on a rather conceptual level, while empirical studies on ‘how to actually do it’ are still rare. Therefore, this paper aims {{to contribute to a}} further elaboration of the concept, taking the newly emerging discourses on complexity and their impact on the institutional dynamics of the Flemish environmental health risk <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement</b> as a starting point. Methodology. A thorough discourse analysis is undertaken using document analysis and in-depth interviews. In order to evaluate the performance of the risk <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement,</b> an evaluation framework is developed based on literature review. Findings. The Flemish environmental health risk <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement</b> succeeds in increasing the exchange information: 1) between the local, Flemish, federal and European governmental level; 2) between scientists and policymakers; 3) between environmental and public health civil servants; 4) between the general public and the experts or policymakers. Nevertheless, the analysis also provides insights into some shortcomings and recommendations to ameliorate this arrangement. The contents’ recommendations regard: 1) a formalized procedure for appropriate uncertainty management, 2) the integration of environmental health objectives in all relevant policy domains, and 3) further research and a socio-political debate about environmental health indicators. At the organizational level, a point of interest relates to the strategies facilitating co-production of knowledge and multi-actor governance. Originality/value of paper.

Under this programme, farmers are financially rewarded - by both public and private bodies - for their nature and landscape management and development activities.

40|$|Because {{seas and}} coastlines are shared between states, the {{formulation}} {{and implementation of}} marine spatial planning (MSP) should be transboundary by nature. The main argument {{of this paper is}} that MSP should be organized as a transboundary policy-making process, but this is hampered by the conceptual and institutional fragmentation MSP is facing. Based on an analysis of four transboundary planning processes in different European seas, the paper gives insight into the possibilities to develop and implement transboundary marine spatial planning (TMSP). To overcome the conceptual and institutional challenges, TMSP should be developed as a reflexive <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement,</b> in which the actors involved are able to change {{the rules of the game}} and to challenge the existing (national-oriented) MSP discourses.

40|$|The {{present study}} uses the {{analytical}} framework of multi-level governance (MLG) {{to investigate the}} implementation of EU’s participatory rural development (RD) policy LEADER (Liaison Entre Actions de Développement de l'Économie Rurale" meaning "Links between the rural economy and development actions”) in Estonia, a country outside of the mainstream academic debates on MLG and LEADER. It provides insight into the restrictions on autonomy faced by the local action groups (LAGs), the local level implementers of the RD policy measure, at the doorstep of the 2014 - 2020 programming period of EU structural funds. Even though LEADER is well-known for its bottom-up approach and finding solutions to local needs based on local resources and potential, it is actually very much influenced by the MLG framework within which it operates {{as well as the}} rules regulating its implementation, which in practice makes the local level constrained in what it is and what it is not allowed to do. The thesis investigates why the implementation of RD policies may diverge from the originally devised policy at the European level. Based on MLG theory all the levels included in the LEADER <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement</b> – the European (the European Commission), the national (the Managing Authority and the Paying Agency) and the local (the LAGs) – are expected to {{have a role to play}} in shaping the <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The study first ascertains the degree of autonomy the EU level has intended to grant to the local level for policy implementation. As the second step it compares the actual implementation of the LEADER programme in Estonia to the EU level intentions and identifies a gap in-between. The study identifies that the restrictions which are causing the constraints faced by the LAGs have been introduced by the national level, not the EU level, and that these national level restrictions are undue. Thus the research finally establishes that the sub-national level has less autonomy in implementing LEADER than the EU level had initially intended because of the way the national level is involved in the <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement</b> and the additional restrictions it has introduced. This confirms the hypothesis that the involvement of the national level plays the decisive role in determining the eventual form of the <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{studies the}} effect of limited {{liability}} on corporate architecture. Corporate architecture refers {{to the use of}} governance instruments within the firm to control the behavior of employees. Four general instruments are defined that form the basis of the firm as a <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement.</b> These four are decision control rights, reward schemes, information systems and conflict resolution rules. Limited liability influences the way in which an incorporated group of firms employs each of these instruments. An efficient use of the governance instruments in such a group implies that lower hierarchical levels, incorporated in subsidiaries, will have more discretionary decision rights, higher powered incentives and less information requirements than a group that does not organize its business risks in incorporated subsidiaries. Corporate groups thus differ in their <b>governance</b> <b>arrangement</b> from firms that have not organized in corporate groups. Alternatives that restrict limited liability have {{the effect of}} centralizing rights, flattening reward schemes and increasing investment in information systems. If corporate groups have attuned their architecture optimally, then restricting limited liability generates additional coordination costs. ...|$|E
