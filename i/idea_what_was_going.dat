500|$|The Gunnerkrigg Court webcomic is told in {{a series}} of episodic {{chapters}} such that each, while forming part of the overall storyline, also functions individually as a stand-alone story arc."Each of the chapters individually is sort of a self-contained thing, so if you were to just read one of them it wouldn't be like you had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on." [...] The themes and topics of the chapters vary widely: as one reviewer describes, [...] "You are also not subjected to 400-plus pages of intricate plot movement. While there is an overall story arc, there are also lighter chapters that focus on unusual classes ... or small moments that build the main characters." [...] Each chapter begins with a title page and ends with one or more [...] "bonus pages," [...] which are not integral to the main storyline but often offer ancillary details about the world of Gunnerkrigg Court or about minor characters. [...] The chapters have varied in length from four pages to more than eighty. [...] Each page is drawn in traditional (A4; 210 × 297mm) page format and divided arbitrarily into frames. At the bottom of the most recent page is a link to a comments thread for that page, in which readers may comment on and discuss that day's comic.|$|E
500|$|Nichols {{had done}} {{commercial}} work {{and had a}} bit part as a model in the romantic drama film Autumn in New York (2000) when her modeling agent helped her get a one-episode role in the fourth season of Sex and the City (2002). She later said she had [...] "never really done a proper audition before", and added that [...] "I had such fun , that day actually {{made me want to}} pursue [...] more seriously." [...] Later that year she was cast in her first major film role as Jessica, a dogged student newspaper reporter, in [...] (2003). Although the film was panned by critics, making it was a learning experience for Nichols. She said, [...] "I was a sponge for the entire time I was in Atlanta [...] and freely admitted that I had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on. I had never done a big film before, I had never been the lead in a film before and any advice anyone wanted to give me, I was more than willing to take." [...] The following year, Nichols played a member of a high school debate team in the independent film Debating Robert Lee (2004) and had a two-episode role in the crime drama television series Line of Fire (2004), which was cancelled after 11 of 13 produced episodes were broadcast. By August 2004, she was cast in supporting roles in the horror films The Amityville Horror (2005) and The Woods (2006).|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery from MTV {{commented that}} [...] "Gaga {{has created a}} world that, while oppressive, also looks great." [...] In a {{separate}} piece Montgomery added that [...] "... she may have finally reached the point in her career where not even she can top herself." [...] Rolling Stones Daniel Kreps called the video a [...] "cinematic epic." [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly, liked the video; however, he had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on: [...] "I can’t wait to hear Lady Gaga explain her latest video, “Alejandro.” Mostly because after watching it (twice!), I have absolutely no clue what’s going on beyond the obvious." [...] Anthony Benigno from Daily News felt that [...] "the shock songstress' new music video [...] is chock full of bed-ridden S imagery that makes it look like the softcore answer to The Matrix. Randall Roberts from Los Angeles Times said [...] "the clip reinforces the notion that no one understands the convergence of image and music right now better than Gaga." [...] Jed Gottlieb from the Boston Herald said that [...] "The plot [...] is hard to decipher, but it’s clearly not a story that ends happily ever after." [...] Jen Dose from National Post commented [...] "Gaga’s new vid for 'Alejandro' certainly brings the crazy we’ve all come to expect from her. It’s like an 8+ minute homage to Madonna—with some gay Nazis thrown in for good measure". Amy Odell of New York said the video's outfits were not as [...] "intense" [...] as those of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] or [...] "Telephone." [...] Nate Jones of Time Magazine disliked the song, but felt the video [...] "looks fantastic... the self-conscious ballsiness of Gaga and director Steven Klein works here." [...] Jennifer Cady from E! liked the video, but {{did not think it}} was as good as Gaga's previous work. Julie Moult from Daily Mail said [...] ", no-one could accuse Lady Gaga of being the shy and retiring type." ...|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, a {{scientist}} already has an <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on, a hypothesis, and {{he or she}} performs an expression profiling experiment with the idea of potentially disproving this hypothesis. In other words, the scientist is making a specific prediction about levels of expression that {{could turn out to be}} false.|$|R
50|$|Siegfried (Siggi) Schwäbli is a {{character}} who first appeared in 1990 in some episodes of Total Normal. Slow-witted, short-sighted and with glasses made of plastic blocks, Siggi constantly puts his foot in it and often has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on. At the Cannstatter Volksfest festival in Stuttgart, for example, {{he went on the}} ghost train with Barbara Schöneberger, a TV host, and almost passed out with fear.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the rest}} of the cartoon depicts Daffy and Porky {{confusing}} Granny with the actual suspect (because of their identical clothing), and bungling said attempts to capture the crook. An annoyed Granny, who has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on, mistakes the inept policemen for mischievous trick-or-treaters, while the robber (who is hiding out in a vacant apartment in the same building Granny is living) also foils every attempt by Daffy and Porky.|$|R
2500|$|Steele {{never saw}} a {{complete}} screenplay for the film. Instead, she was simply handed the scenes she would play, and her dialogue, every morning of the production.

2500|$|On February 20, 1971, NORAD at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado {{was ready}} to {{broadcast}} a normal required weekly test of the Emergency Broadcast System. However, AT reported that the United States Air Force used the wrong tape for the test by accident, and initiated an Emergency Action Notification, normally issued by the Office of Civil Defense or the President. This prompted all stations in the Fort Wayne, Indiana, area by order of the FCC to operate under emergency procedures and feed the broadcast from WOWO through their radios. Bob Sievers was at the microphone at WOWO at the time, and he, along with everyone at the studio, had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on.|$|E

5000|$|The {{music video}} premiered on May 23, 2011 on iTunes. It was {{directed}} by Nigel Dick who is famous for directing music videos {{for the likes of}} Britney Spears, Oasis and Nickelback and shot in Malibu on May 7, 2011. The plot of the video revolves around Cook’s visit to the beach to write a few songs and get over the loss of his girl. He then arrives at a beach and after paying the taxi driver, he drops his wallet. After writing some songs, he takes off his jacket and starts walking along the beach. A woman walks by and sees his belongings and footsteps that led out to the sea. Fearing that Cook had drowned, she calls the police and explains everything. Meanwhile, Cook returns to his room solving a crossword puzzle and playing the guitar and has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on. A police border was made around the beach and some of Cook's band members tells their band mate Neal Tiemann about the news which was printed {{on the front page of}} the newspaper bearing the caption 'David Cook, Feared Drowned'. They then watch the news where the news caption says 'Singer left note'. Cook who has no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on, then leaves his room and sees his band members outside looking sad. Oblivious to his presence, he asks them [...] "What are you looking at?". Then his drummer faints.|$|R
2500|$|In 2004, Dench {{appeared}} as Aereon, an ambassador of the Elemental race who helps uncover the mysterious past of Richard B. Riddick, played by Vin Diesel, in David Twohy's science fiction sequel, The Chronicles of Riddick. Selected by Diesel, who prompted writers {{to re-create the}} character to fit a female persona {{because he wanted to}} work with the actress, she called filming [...] "tremendous fun", although she [...] "had absolutely no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on in the plot." [...] The film was a critical and box office failure. In his review of the film, James Berardinelli from ReelViews remarked that he felt that Dench's character served no more [...] "useful purpose than to give [...] an opportunity to appear in a science fiction movie." ...|$|E

We sat down and talked", and [...] "Pat was in the room with us, and he had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen. He had a strong relationship with Bret. He wouldn't have done it, and Vince knew that. That's why he didn't tell Pat...". However, in Dave Meltzer's online account of events before, during, and after the Screwjob, he states [...] "Vince McMahon held a meeting at the hotel with Jim Ross, Jim Cornette, Pat Patterson and Michaels. Reports are that {{at least two of the}} aforementioned names looked extremely uncomfortable leaving the meeting" [...] which suggests that Patterson may in fact have been in on the Screwjob. This is corroborated by a Pro Wrestling Torch article from November 15, 1997 by Wade Keller which states, [...] "However, a two-hour meeting was held on the second floor of the Montreal Marriott on Saturday night with McMahon, Jim Ross, Pat Patterson, Jim Cornette, and Michaels. Bret was wrestling that night in Detroit. There is some belief that at this meeting McMahon proposed the idea of the finish to whoever of that group wasn't already in on it. Ross and Patterson entered the meeting in a good mood and when they were seen in the hotel lobby afterwards, were said to be irritable, forlorn, and shaken." ...|$|E
60|$|At length {{the driving}} team was unyoked--he {{could hear it}} being led away--but the ache in his head grew almost {{intolerable}} and his lassitude more intense. For a while he had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on; and then a hoarse cry, which seemed one of alarm, rang out sharply. There was a patter of running feet, a thud of hoofs on the soft soil, and, breaking through these sounds, a rhythmic staccato drumming. Somebody was riding hard across the uneven ground.|$|E

I was shocked, and then admiring of George’s ruthlessness. It’s a tough thing to build up a character and make somebody as memorable and impressive as Ned and then get rid of him. But {{at the same time it}} leads to a story that is so much more suspenseful because you truly have no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to happen and who <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to survive.|$|R
6000|$|Number 6, however, was an {{exception}} to former passions--Francis Bell was the most faithful of lovers.

But, on {{the first anniversary of}} her marriage, Vadinho returns. He is now a ghost, but has lost none of his old ways.

This motivation is also sparked by her aspiration to attend medical school, which requires doing well on the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT).
