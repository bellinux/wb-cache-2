Seeking to transcend the classical debate between its supporters and adversaries, the present study submits that {{the concept of}} abuse of EU law is located on three major fault-lines of EU law, which accounts for the well-established controversies in the field. The first fault-line, which is common to all legal orders, opposes legal congruence (the tendency to yield equitable legal outcomes) to legal certainty (the tendency to yield predictable legal outcomes). Partisans of legal congruence tend to advocate the prohibition of abuses of law, whereas partisans of legal certainty tend to oppose it. The second fault-line is specific to EU law and divides two conceptions of the regulation of the internal market. If economic integration is conceived as the promotion of cross-border competition among private businesses (the paradigm of 'regulatory neutrality'), choices of law must be proscribed as abusive, for they distort business competition. But if economic integration is intended to promote competition among Member States (the paradigm of 'regulatory competition'), choices of law by EU citizens represent a desirable process of arbitrage among national laws. The third and final fault-line corresponds to the tension between two orientations of the economic constitution of the European Union, namely the fear of private power and the fear of public power. Those who fear private power most tend to endorse the prohibition of abuses of law, whereas those who fear public power most tend to reject it. Seen in this way, the concept of abuse of EU law offers a forum in which fundamental questions about the nature and function of EU law can be confronted and examined in a new light.

40|$|International audiencePaul and Ned Hall's book {{makes an}} {{original}} and {{important contribution to}} the philosophical debate on causation. Their aim is not to construct a theory of causation but " to sketch a map " of the " landscape " (p. 1) constituted by a rich set of problem cases and various theories of causation devised to account for them. Chapter 1 presents the scope and aim of the book, justifies the method of evaluating theories of causation by exploring whether they are refuted by counterexamples, and {{provides an overview of}} the rest of the book. Chapter 2 justifies the choice of problems and solutions considered in the book. Several assumptions are made from the beginning. Causation is taken to be a relation among particular events rather than types of events. A " reductionist outlook " is adopted, according to which facts about what causes what are determined by <b>i)</b> <b>facts</b> about what happens and ii) fundamental laws. These assumptions provide the background for a " minimal sufficiency account " of causation (p. 16), which is a version of a regularity account. The other approaches that are introduced and examined in light of their capacity to cope with problem cases include the following: probabilistic accounts, transference accounts, and counterfactual accounts. Several versions of the counterfactual account get special attention: 1) Lewis' (1973) theory of chains of non-­‐ backtracking counterfactual dependence, 2) Lewis' (2000) account of causation as influence, 3) accounts of " de facto dependence ", versions of which have been put forward by Yablo (2004) and Hitchcock (2001), and finally 4) contrastivism, according to which causal relations have the form " C rather than C* causes E rather than E* ". But Paul and Hall provide more than a useful overview of the literature. They analyze the aims that the various approaches fix themselves or, in the authors' own words, the " conflicting motivations and conflicting presuppositions about the very point of providing a philosophical account of causation " (p. 1). Their own conception of giving an account of causation is expressed in a list of rules. An account of causation is satisfactory if 1) it is reductive and avoids circular use of causal notions in the analysis, 2) it is metaphysically conservative and avoids the postulation of " extravagant " entities, such as negative events to account for causation by omission, 3) it is conceptually parsimonious and tries to analyze causation as directly as possible in terms of fundamental categories, 4) it applies not only to our actual world but also to other possible worlds, 5) it leaves open the possibility that some causal intuitions are wrong. Chapters 3 to 5 evaluate in rigorous detail how several approaches, the most promising ones according to Paul and Hall, cope with problem cases. Chapter 3 explores various types of " redundant causation ", such as preemption and overdetermination, which have been the focus of an important part of the literature on counterfactual approaches to causation. Chapters 4 and 5 explore causation by omission and two types of situation in which it is unclear whether causation is transitive, i. e. double prevention and switching. The last chapter, Chapter 6 contains concluding remarks...|$|E
