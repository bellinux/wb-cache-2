5|$|High-resolution {{images of}} Io {{acquired}} when Io is experiencing an eclipse reveal an aurora-like glow. As on Earth, {{this is due}} to particle radiation hitting the atmosphere, though in this case the charged particles come from Jupiter's magnetic field rather than the solar wind. Aurorae usually occur near the magnetic poles of planets, but Io's are brightest near its equator. Io lacks an intrinsic magnetic field of its own; therefore, electrons traveling along Jupiter's magnetic field near Io directly impact Io's atmosphere. More electrons collide with its atmosphere, producing the brightest aurora, where the field lines are tangent to Io (i.e. near the equator), because the column of gas they pass through is longest there. Aurorae associated with these tangent points on Io are observed to rock with the changing orientation of Jupiter's tilted magnetic dipole. Fainter aurora from oxygen atoms along the limb of Io (the red <b>glows</b> in the image at right), and sodium atoms on Io's night-side (the green <b>glows</b> in the same image) have also been observed.|$|E
5|$|Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} {{is similar to}} that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium <b>glows</b> in the dark with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|E

5|$|Neon is the second-lightest noble gas, after helium. It <b>glows</b> reddish-orange in {{a vacuum}} {{discharge}} tube. Also, neon has the narrowest liquid range of any element: from 24.55 K to 27.05 K (−248.45°C to −245.95°C, or −415.21°F to −410.71°F). It has over 40 times the refrigerating capacity of liquid helium and three times that of liquid hydrogen (on a per unit volume basis). In most applications it is a less expensive refrigerant than helium.|$|E
5|$|The {{crown of}} the South Tower {{contains}} {{a band of}} 25 LED floodlights that remain lit all night. Each LED light consumes little energy and has a lifetime of 40,000 hours. These lights are used to signal the weather, just like {{the lights on the}} John Hancock Tower in Boston. The crown <b>glows</b> red if warmer weather is in the forecast. A blue crown signifies that cold weather is expected soon. Green means that there is at least a 50 percent chance of rain. Amber indicates that the weather will remain unchanged. This is the San Francisco Bay Area's first weather beacon. The crown began lighting up on December 8, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Yagnavalkya {{explains}} that warm air inhaled passes to the Brahmarandhra via the navel which helps in curing diseases. When hot air is {{retained in the}} heart it is the stage when it makes entry into the Sahasrara Chakra, the thousand petaled lotus, that then emerges in an inverted form. When the vital air is held in the abode of Brahman (Atman), which is the heart, according to verses 12.15–22, the fire located {{in the region of}} Susumna, which is between the eyebrows <b>glows.</b> These exercises, which stimulates the heart with vital air and fire, lead to the perception of light internally and externally. At this stage one should behold with the mind's eye, the fire-like glowing moon in the forehead, and meditate on the inner self in the Chitta (mind).|$|E

50|$|By {{adjusting}} {{the concentrations of}} the two chemicals, manufacturers can produce <b>glow</b> sticks that either <b>glow</b> brightly for {{a short amount of}} time or more dimly for an extended length of time. This also allows design of <b>glow</b> sticks that perform satisfactorily in hot or cold climates, by compensating for the temperature dependence of reaction. At maximum concentration (typically only found in laboratory settings), mixing the chemicals results in a furious reaction, producing large amounts of light for only a few seconds. Heating a <b>glow</b> stick also causes the reaction to proceed faster and the <b>glow</b> stick to <b>glow</b> more brightly for a brief period. Cooling a <b>glow</b> stick slows the reaction a small amount and causes it to last longer, but the light is dimmer. This can be demonstrated by refrigerating or freezing an active <b>glow</b> stick; when it warms up again, it will resume <b>glowing.</b> The dyes used in <b>glow</b> sticks usually exhibit fluorescence when exposed to ultraviolet radiation—even a spent <b>glow</b> stick may therefore shine under a black light.|$|R

5|$|Exploration of {{the docks}} reveals a strange {{canister}} filled with swirling liquid. Thinking the canister contains healing or energizing properties, the Shaper breaks the seal and absorbs the contents. Instead the contents absorb into the Shaper's body, strengthening and changing it. The changes become visibly apparent, the player character's skin smoothens and <b>glows</b> slightly. The canisters also affect the user's mental state, causing a more violent and arrogant temperament. Serviles {{remain on the}} island, having been abandoned when the island was Barred. They are intelligent creations of Shapers, designed to serve them without question or hesitation. These Serviles have had no contact with Shapers for two centuries, and have separated into three groups with differing philosophies regarding their creators. The Obeyers are still faithful to the Shapers, the Awakened believe {{that they should be}} treated as equals. The Takers have rejected Shapers completely and view the sect as oppressors to be fought.|$|E
5|$|Picard and an away team {{board the}} Stargazer, and he orders a chest of his {{belongings}} {{to be sent}} to the Enterprise. Hidden in the chest is an orb, which <b>glows</b> brighter as Bok activates it, causing Picard to be hit by a wave of pain. Dr. Crusher orders him back to the Enterprise. Data meanwhile finds a discrepancy in the Stargazers logs stating that the Ferengi were attacked under a flag of truce. Upon further investigation, Data and La Forge report to Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) that the logs were certainly faked. Dr. Crusher and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) discuss the Captain, and Wesley shows them some unusual activity from the Ferengi ship. They head to inform Riker to alert him to the signals, who is informed by the Enterprise computer that Picard has transported to the Stargazer.|$|E
5|$|While Lee Adama (Jamie Bamber) and a newly {{returned}} Kara Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) head to Galactica, {{the advancing}} Cylons destroy one ship and damage others, {{killing at least}} 600. After discovering their true identities, Cylons Saul Tigh (Michael Hogan), Tory Foster (Rekha Sharma), Samuel Anders (Michael Trucco), and Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas) continue their jobs. Tigh is ordered to send every Viper to defend the fleet, but has a vision where he assassinates Admiral Adama (Edward James Olmos) before carrying it out. New Viper pilot Anders is sent out, worried a hidden Cylon program would activate and make him turn against the fleet. His guns are unresponsive while targeting a Raider. As Anders and the Raider come face-to-face, the Raider scans Anders, and in doing so, Anders' iris momentarily <b>glows</b> red. In response to this, the Raider flips direction and it, {{along with all the}} other Raiders, immediately stop the attack and retreat to their basestar and jump away, much to the surprise of the fleet.|$|E

40|$|Despite a {{widespread}} {{interest in the}} warm <b>glow</b> model [Andreoni (1989, 1990) ], surprisingly most attention focused on the voluntary contribution equilibrium of the model, and only very {{little attention has been}} devoted to the competitive equilibrium. In this paper, we introduce the notion of competitive equilibrium for a warm <b>glow</b> economy [Henceforth, warm <b>glow</b> equilibrium]. Then, we establish (and prove), in the contest of our model, the three fundamental theorems of general equilibrium: (i) warm <b>glow</b> equilibrium exists; (ii) a warm <b>glow</b> equilibrium is Pareto efficient; and (iii) a Pareto efficient allocation can be decentralized as a warm <b>glow</b> equilibrium). The concept of a warm <b>glow</b> equilibrium may prove to be very useful to the normative and positive theory of public goods provision. First, it is a price based mechanism achieving efficient outcomes. Secondly, not only the warm <b>glow</b> equilibrium outcomes could serve as a point of reference to measure free-riding and welfare loss, but also due to warm <b>glow</b> effects, unlike Lindahl allocations, {{they are more likely to}} be achieved.

40|$|The voltage–current {{characteristics}} of <b>glow</b> discharges in gas mixture (N 2 :O 2 = 8 : 2) at a pressure of 10 Torr were obtained with the discharge current up to 150 A. Parallel-plane electrodes with {{a diameter of}} 10. 7 cm and a discharge chamber with co-axial geometry were used to produce <b>glow</b> discharge with high current. The <b>glow</b> discharge voltage was almost constant until the whole surface of the cathode was covered with <b>glow,</b> i. e., until the discharge current became 3. 7 A in our experimental condition (a normal <b>glow</b> discharge mode). The voltage, however, increased with the current when the <b>glow</b> covered over the cathode (an abnormal <b>glow</b> discharge mode). The electron density in positive column of the high-current <b>glow</b> discharge was obtained to be 3 × 1011  cm− 3 from Langmuir probe measurements...|$|R
