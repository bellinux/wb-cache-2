The shell division manufactures the skeleton of the rail coach, while the furnishing division {{is concerned with the}} coach interiors and amenities. An ancillary unit to the Integral Coach Factory is being built in Haldia, West Bengal for furnishing diesel multiple units. ICF manufactures more than 170 varieties of coach including first and second class coaches, pantry and kitchen cars, luggage and brake vans, self-propelled coaches, electric (EMU), diesel (DMU) and mainline electric multiple units (MEMU), metro coaches and diesel electric tower cars, accident relief medical vans (ARMV), inspection cars (RA), fuel test cars, track recording cars and luxury coaches. The plant employs about 13,000 people and manufactures about 1500 coaches per year. ICF churned out 1,503 coaches in 2010 and in August 2011, ICF was sanctioned a project for manufacturing stainless steel shells and <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>bogies</b> and an increase in capacity from 1,500 to 1,700 coaches. In 2013-14, it built 25 LHB Coaches, 248 air-conditioned and 1185 non-ac coaches. It plans to increase its manufacturing capacity of LHB coaches. It has set a target to manufacture 300 LHB coaches in 2014-15 and reach a capacity of 1000 LHB coaches by 2016-17. A total of 50,000 coaches had been produced till 18 Aug 2015 by ICF since its inception.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} bogie primary and {{secondary}} suspension stiffness and damping characteristics on the dynamics behavior of a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> train are scrutinized based on the multiplicative dimensional reduction method. A one-car railway vehicle model is chosen for the analysis at two levels of the bogie suspension system: symmetric and asymmetric configurations. Several operational scenarios including straight and circular curved tracks are considered, and measurement data are used as the track irregularities. Ride comfort, safety, and wear objective functions are specified to evaluate the vehicle’s performance. In order to have an appropriate cut center for the sensitivity analysis, the genetic algorithm optimization routine is employed to optimize the {{primary and secondary}} suspension components in terms of wear and comfort, respectively. The global sensitivity indices are introduced and the Gaussian quadrature integrals are employed to evaluate the simplified sensitivity indices correlated to the objective functions. The most influential suspension components are recognized and a thorough analysis of the results is given. The outcomes of the current research provide informative data that can be beneficial in design and optimization of passive and active suspension components for <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> train <b>bogies...</b>|$|R
40|$|When {{designing}} and optimizing a rail vehicle {{there is a}} contradiction between, on the one hand, stability on straight track at <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> and, on the other hand, reasonable wheel and rail wear in small- and medium radius curves. <b>Higher</b> <b>speeds</b> require to some extent stiffer wheelset guidance to avoid hunting and ensure stability. However, with stiffer wheelset guidance the risk of increased wheel and rail wear in curves is imminent. In this paper, {{the process of developing}} and optimizing a track-friendly bogie is described. A multi-body system (MBS) simulation model was used, taking due consideration to nonlinearities in suspension and wheel-rail contact, as well as realistic flexibilities in the track. Adequate and systematic consideration is taken {{to a wide range of}} possible non-linear wheel-rail combinations. Dynamic stability is investigated both on straight track and in wide curves at <b>high</b> <b>speeds.</b> The balance between flange wear and tread wear is studied in order to maximize wheel life between re-profiling operations in the intended average operation. The result is a bogie with relatively soft wheelset guidance allowing passive radial self-steering, which in combination with appropriate yaw damping ensures stability on straight track at <b>higher</b> <b>speeds.</b> The <b>bogie</b> has been subject to both certification testing and long-term service testing in the Gröna Tåget (the Green Train) research and development programme. 1...|$|R
40|$|A robust {{controller}} {{is designed}} for active steering of a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> train <b>bogie</b> with solid axle wheel sets to reduce track irregularity effects on the vehicle’s dynamics and improve stability and curving performance. A half-car railway vehicle model with seven degrees of freedom equipped with practical accelerometers and angular velocity sensors is considered for the H∞ control design. The controller is robust against the wheel/rail contact parameter variations. Field measurement data are used as the track irregularities in simulations. The control {{force is applied to}} the vehicle model via ball-screw electromechanical actuators. To compensate the actuator dynamics, the time delay is identified online and is used in a second order polynomial extrapolation carried out to predict and modify the control command to the actuator. The performance of the proposed controller and actuator dynamics compensation technique are examined on a one-car railway vehicle model with realistic structural parameters and nonlinear wheel and rail profiles. The results showed that for the case of nonlinear wheel and rail profiles significant improvements in the active control performance can be achieved using the proposed compensation technique...|$|R
40|$|Suspension {{components}} play {{a crucial}} role in bogie dynamics behavior. In this regard, passive and active systems are developed to meet various design requirements. Adaptive suspension systems can adjust the bogie dynamics with respect to different operational scenarios and as a result improve the vehicle performance. Therefore, there is a great demand on design of adaptive suspension systems for <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> train <b>bogies.</b> Sensitivity analysis, optimization, and active vibration control techniques are the most important steps towards adaptive bogie design. In this thesis, the target is to cover these steps partly by formulating and solving the prescribed problems for some example railway vehicle models. Therefore, hierarchical levels of vehicle modelling are considered. The overall performance of a vehicle can be evaluated from different perspectives. In this thesis, the dynamics behaviour of railway vehicles is reflected by ride comfort, wear, safety, and in particular running stability, track shift force, and risk of derailment objective functions. The mathematical representation of the prescribed objectives as well as the evaluation procedure are described thoroughly. As an example on optimization problem with application in railway vehicles, the comfort/safety multiobjective optimization of a one car vehicle lateral dampers is considered. The genetic algorithm routine is used to solve this problem. In order to have a better wear estimation, a theoretical contact search approach is applied to calculate the creepages and wear. The optimization problem of primary dampers towards wear showed that one might achieve better wear performance by using active technology in bogie primary suspension components. Therefore, different on/off semi-active control strategies are integrated together with the magnetorheological dampers in bogie primary suspension and the corresponding effects on wear is explored on different operational scenarios. Finally, to have a better insight into adaptive bogie design, the global sensitivity analysis of bogie dynamics behavior with respect to suspension components is considered. The multiplicative version of the dimension reduction method is employed to provide the sensitivity indices. The result of such analysis can narrow down the number of input variables for the optimization and adaptive bogie design problems and improve the computational efficiency. All in all, this thesis deals with formulating and solving some example problems on the sensitivity analysis and optimization of railway vehicles. Furthermore, as an introduction to active bogie systems, the application of semi-active vibration control strategies in bogie primary suspension is also considered. The results of the current thesis can provide useful hints in design of adaptive suspension system for <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> train <b>bogies...</b>|$|R

Lower weight and costs are the benefits of using these materials. In addition they offer the possibility of realizing new hingeless and bearingless rotor concepts. The reason for these developments is their simplicity, which improves the reliability remarkably.

40|$|Primary {{suspension}} {{components of}} <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> train <b>bogies</b> {{can affect the}} vehicle's performance from different points of view, such as wear reduction and increasing forward speed to decrease track access charges. Various types of suspension components, {{as well as several}} control techniques, have been developed to amend the cost efficiency of railway operation; with respect to speed, wear, ride comfort, and safety. In the current study, the research overview is laid out with focus on the state-of-the-art, introducing semi-active technology for primary suspension of a <b>bogie</b> for <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> trains. The dynamic behaviour of a one car vehicle model developed in SIMPACK running on various operational scenarios including tangent and curved tracks is considered. The focus is to investigate the effects of passive and different semi-active control strategies on wear. For the passive case, an optimization problem is formulated to find the values of design parameters that guarantee minimum wear in system, while safety and comfort are taken as thresholds. Primary longitudinal and lateral stiffness as well as the primary suspension damper characteristics are chosen as design parameters and genetic algorithm based optimization routine in MATLAB is employed to solve the optimization problems. The attained optimized suspension parameters are applied in a one car railway vehicle model that is developed {{to be used as a}} reference case for comparison for the semi-active vibration control techniques. Application of magnetorheological (MR) dampers in the bogie's primary suspension, integrated with several semi-active on-off control strategies, is investigated. The outcomes of this research can amend the cost efficiency of railway operation (especially reduce wear) and give some hints for the design process of adaptive bogies...|$|R

40|$|As an {{important}} part of <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> trains, any fault or failure of the bogie may cause fatal disaster and/or expensive lost. Considering on-train condition monitoring system is still restricted by many limits, bogie condition monitoring via rail vibration may be very valuable. For the rail vibration signals exited by bogies are short termed, non-periodic, non-stationary, not pre-separated corresponding to wheels, and with time-shifting of phases, they must be separated corresponding to each wheel for fault location. In this paper, to separate and reconstruct the vibration signals from two bogie wheels, a measurement mixing model is established and some assumptions about <b>bogie</b> <b>speed,</b> measure accordance, etc. are given. Based on envelope correlation analysis of signals from multi-sensors, the <b>bogie</b> <b>speed</b> and measurement windows are estimated so that the rail vibration signals can be separated corresponding to each bogie wheel, which allows the contact dynamics of the wheel-track to be characterized accurately for the purpose of diagnostics.
