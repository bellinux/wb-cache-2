40|$|The {{focus of}} this APP {{research}} program was to improve the bond coats used in the fabrication of flame sprayed instrumentation. Typically. a bond coat is applied to a superalloy surface prior to {{the application of a}} thin dielectric coating onto which instrumentation is placed. After affixing the instrumentation, a much thicker ceramic topcoat is typically applied to protect the instrumentation from harsh environments. The fatigue life of NiCoCrAlY coated superalloys was extended beyond current state-of-the-art by relatively simple and cost effective means. Heat treatment in reduced oxygen partial pressures at 1750 to 1800 F effectively doubled the fatigue life of NiCoCrAlY coated substrates relative to as-sprayed substrates and when used in conjunction with platinum diffusion barriers yielded a four fold increase in the fatigue life of NiCoCrAlY coated substrates. Further improvements in the fatigue life of thermally sprayed coatings were made by employing intermediate coatings, which minimized thermal expansion differences between the bond coat and top coat. Combinatorial chemistry experiments yielded an optimum composition for an intermediate TCE matching coating that showed considerable promise in extending the fatigue life of thermal spray instrumentation. The <b>intermediate</b> <b>coating</b> had two functions: to reduce the surface roughness of the peaks and valleys associated with the as-sprayed NiCoCrAlY bond coat, and to produce a thin layer of a mixture of Al 2 O 3 and NiCoCrAlY that exhibited an intermediate TCE.

40|$|The use of {{nanoscale}} materials {{has become}} {{common practice in}} a variety of industries such as electronics, medicine, cosmetics, construction and automobile to name a few. Whether used as dispersed nanoparticles or in the form of coatings and thin films, these nanomaterials open up a world of possibilities for new emerging technologies. Carbon nanomaterials in particular have great potential with a dynamic range of interesting properties in different dimensional structures. Under most application conditions the nanomaterials need to be protected from mechanical and/or chemical disruption by a protective matrix. In this thesis the feasibility and viability of fabricating thin composite films by embedding carbon nanomaterials in a protective matrix is explored. Tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C) containing high sp 3 bonded carbon fraction has been selected as the protective matrix due to its high hardness, chemical inertness, optical transparency and ability to be deposited as a thin film. Carbon nanomaterials in the form of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and detonation nanodiamonds (DNDs) were tested in this thesis, due to their increasing usage in applications related to conductive films, thin film transistors, sensing elements and photonic components. SWCNT networks were coated by ta-C using a pulsed filtered cathodic arc process (p-FCVA) and tested to ascertain the electrical and mechanical properties. Experimental results supported by simulations show that ta-C coating with high sp 3 carbon fraction of 75 % could be deposited onto the SWCNT networks. The ta-C coating encapsulates the SWCNT bundles providing superior mechanical and chemical protection with 60 % reduction in wear and limited immunity to oxygen plasma in comparison to uncoated network. The increase of electrical resistance by around 4500 % for the SWCNT network post deposition of ta-C coating, has been investigated. The predominant cause of this resistance increase is attributed to the intrinsic compressive stress of the ta-C coating which moves the SWCNT bundle junctions apart, thus increasing the contact resistance leading to drastic increase in the network resistance. It has been shown that use of an <b>intermediate</b> <b>coating</b> between the SWCNT network and ta-C coating limits the resistance increase to manageable proportions. A 9 nm thick evaporated carbon coating as intermediate layer, limited the network resistance increase to 90 % and improved the mechanical wear by 50 % in comparison to ta-C coated network without <b>intermediate</b> <b>coating.</b> Furthermore, a novel method to deposit DND embedded ta-C composite films in a single step using p-FCVA process has been demonstrated here. The DND-ta-C composite film, with DND concentration of the order of 0. 1 vol% has 15 % increase of hardness and 40 % lower wear in comparison to ta-C film. Even under high load and multiple wear test conditions the DND-ta-C composite film has mechanical performance superior to ta-C films making them an ideal candidate for tribological applications...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{influence}} of a hexagonal boron nitride powder surface on the polymer-ization of a benzoxazine monomer is examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). By varying {{the thickness of the}} benzoxazine coatings on boron nitride particles, a distinct {{influence of}} the surface substrate on the polymerization reaction could be observed. At a coating thickness calculated to be on the order of a monolayer, the heat of reaction is reduced, while the exothermic peak temperature and peak width at half height are increased relative to that of the neat resin values. The reduced heat of reaction and increased exothermic peak temperature indicate that the boron nitride surface is inhibiting the benzoxazine polymerization reaction. In the <b>intermediate</b> <b>coating</b> thickness region, the heat of reaction increases and the exothermic peak temperature and peak width at half height decrease with increasing coating thickness. With even thicker coatings, the heat of reaction and exothermic peak temperature and peak width at half height reach values corresponding to that of the neat resin and no longer change with thickness. In addition, the influence of surface treated boron nitride particles on the thermal polymerization behavior, as well as the effect of the surface treatment on the viscosity, dynamic mechanical properties, and flexural properties of the filled composites are also investigated. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

In electroforming of tools formanufacturing optical connectors, the influence of ultrasonic agitation on intrinsic stresses and fillingproperties of electroplated Ni has been studied. It is established that the ultrasonic agitation at the substratesurface during deposition impacts the intrinsic stresses making it possible to increase deposition rate viacurrent density, with stress-free or low-stress levels in the Ni layers. Reduced variations of the intrinsicstress over the surface with the current density is a further important result. Filling of grooves byelectroplating of Ni using ultrasonic agitation is demonstrated. This is due to increasing mass transport ofspecies into the grooves compared to conventional pumped agitation. The enhanced filling propertiesmakes it possible to electroplate Ni in the bottom of high-aspect-ratio grooves. In order to industriallyimplement new nanocomposite coatings on electronic connectors, studies have been performed regardingthe thermal diffusion barrier properties against Cu for Ti-Si-C and Ti-Si-C-Ag nanocomposites, depositeddirectly onto Cu substrates or with sputtered Ni, Ti or electroplated Ni as an <b>intermediate</b> <b>coating.</b> Theapplication of an electroplated Ni diffusion barrier coating, hinders Cu from reaching the surface of thenanocomposites. Also, Ti-Si-C-Ag nanocomposite deposited on magnetron sputtered Ni or Ti on Cusubstrates hinder Cu from diffusing to the surface after annealing. The contact resistance of Ag-Pdtopcoated Ti-Si-C-Ag-Pd and Ti-Si-C-Ag nanocomposite coatings in contact with hard gold is shown tocompete with hard gold in contact with itself, as electrical contact coatings at contact forces around 5 N.

5000|$|As {{the name}} suggests, passive fire {{protection}} remains inactive in the coating system until a fire occurs. There are mainly two types of PFP: intumescent fire protection and vermiculite fire protection. In vermiculite fire protection, the structural steel members are covered with vermiculite materials, mostly a very thick layer. This is a cheaper option as compared to an intumescent one, but is very crude and aesthetically unpleasant. Moreover, if the environment is corrosive in nature, then the vermiculite option is not advisable, as {{there is the possibility}} of water seeping into it (because of the porous nature of vermiculite), and there it is difficult to monitor for corrosion. Intumescent fireproofing is a layer of paint which is applied along with the coating system on the structural steel members.

For calculation of DFT (dry film thickness) a factor called Hp/A (heated perimeter divided by cross sectional area), referred to as [...] "section factor" [...] and expressed in m−1, is used. Intumescent coatings are applied as an <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat</b> in a <b>coating</b> system (primer, <b>intermediate,</b> and top/finish <b>coat).</b> Because of the relatively low thickness of this intumescent coating (usually in the 350- to 700-micrometer range), nice finish, and anti-corrosive nature, intumescent coatings are preferred on the basis of aesthetics and performance.|$|R

40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{of steel}} {{is one of}} the primary causes for premature failure. The ideal way to overcome this problem is to provide corrosion protection right at the time of manufacturing by hot-dip galvanizing. Conventionally, pure zinc (Zn) galvanizing provide a poor adhesion coating due to formation of brittle intermetallic of Fe–Zn; whilst single layer Zn– 0. 5 wt% Al alloy coating has a poor adhesion due to lack of suitable fluxes. This project is aimed to investigate the effects of various surface preparation treatments of high carbon steel plate on the adhesion and corrosion behaviour of Zn- 0. 5 Al coating. Surface preparation prior to coating is thus crucial in order to obtain better coating adhesion and improve corrosion resistance. In this project, sand blasting and sand grinding were conducted together with chemical pretreatment on the steel substrate prior to Zn- 0. 5 Al coating. The sand blasted, sand ground together with chemical pretreated steel samples were coated with Zn- 0. 5 Al coating by dipping process. Adhesion property was examined on the coated samples by using pin on disc test. Electrochemical and salt spray tests were performed on the coated steels following the ASTM standard. Analysis has been carried out on the samples by using standard material characterization techniques namely optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometer. From this project, it was found that sand blasting followed by chemical pretreatment gave the best coating performance in terms of both adhesion and corrosion protection. This is due to the effect of high surface roughness from sand blasting which led to good mechanical interlocking effect for improved adhesion strength between Zn- 0. 5 Al coating and steel substrate. Subsequently, corrosion protection also improved because Zn- 0. 5 Al alloy coating did not peel off easily during corrosion tests. Sand ground galvanized steel gave the <b>intermediate</b> <b>coating</b> performance and conventional chemical pretreatment galvanized steel had a low coating performance in terms of both adhesion and corrosion protection. It can be concluded that surface roughness has significant effect on the coating adhesion and corrosion protection of galvanized coating...|$|E

Three-point bend tests according to International Organization of Standardization 9693 - 1 : 2012 were carried out to evaluate the debonding strength for the ZrO 2 -CaOecoated specimens (types 1 and 2) in comparison with a noncoated group (control), which received a traditional bonder-based adhesive technique. The results were compared with ANOVA, followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test for pairwise comparisons. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersion spectroscopy were used to examine the interfacial properties and the failure mode of each group. Results. Mean (+-standard deviation) debonding strength values for type 1 coating (25. 97 +- 2. 53 MPa) and control (23. 51 +- 2. 94 MPa) were near the acceptable lower limit of 25 MPa indicated by the International Organization of Standardization 9693 - 1 : 2012 and were not significantly different (Student-Newman-Keuls test, P>. 05). Type 2 coating produced an improved titanium-porcelain bonding (debonding strength¼ 39. 47 +- 4. 12 MPa), significantly higher than both type 1 (Student-Newman-Keuls test, P<. 05) and control (Student-Newman-Keuls test, P<. 05). Scanning electron microscopyeenergy dispersion spectroscopy analysis confirmed these findings, which revealed a predominant cohesive failure mode for type 2. Conclusions. An <b>intermediate</b> <b>coating</b> layer of ZrO 2 -CaO plus a substrate of bonding nickel-aluminum-molybdenum alloy applied by oxyacetylene cold thermal spraying deposition provided an improved titanium-porcelain bond...|$|E
40|$|Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMCs) are {{increasingly}} being considered as structural materials for advanced power generation equipment. Broadly speaking the two classes of materials are oxide-based CMCs and non-oxide based CMCs. The non-oxide CMCs are primarily silicon-based. Under conditions prevalent in the gas turbine hot section the water vapor formed in the combustion of gaseous or liquid hydrocarbons reacts with the surface-SiO 2 to form volatile products. Progressive surface recession of the SiC-SiC CMC component, strength loss {{as a result of}} wall thinning and chemical changes in the component occur, which leads to the loss of structural integrity and mechanical strength and becomes life limiting to the equipment in service. The solutions pursued to improve the life of SiC-SiC CMCs include the incorporation of an external barrier coating to provide surface protection to the CMC substrate. The coating system has become known as an Environmental Barrier Coating (EBC). The relevant early coatings work was focused on coatings for corrosion protection of silicon-based monolithic ceramics operating under severely corrosive conditions. The development of EBCs for gas turbine hot section components was built on the early work for silicon-based monolithics. The first generation EBC is a three-layer coating, which in its simplest configuration consists of a silicon (Si) base coat applied on top of the CMC, a barium-strontium-aluminosilicate (BSAS) surface coat resistant to water vapor attack, and a mullite-based <b>intermediate</b> <b>coating</b> layer between the Si base coat and BSAS top coat. This system can be represented as Si-Mullite-BSAS. While this baseline EBC presented a significant improvement over the uncoated SiC-SiC CMC, for the very long durations of 3 - 4 years or more expected for industrial operation further improvements in coating durability are desirable. Also, for very demanding applications with higher component temperatures but shorter service lives more rugged EBCs will be necessary. A second generation of EBCs incorporates rare earth silicates which have extremely favorable resistance against environmental attack and a higher temperature capability. Performance data for this class of EBCs is more limited and especially field data are not as extensive as for the first generation EBCs. Extensive laboratory, rig and engine testing, including testing of EBC coated SiC-SiC CMCs in actual field applications is in progress. The development of next generation EBCs with even higher temperature capability than the second generation EBC is also underway. This paper will discuss the current status of EBC technology and future direction based on literature survey...|$|E

40|$|The {{titanium}} alloys {{are used in}} defense, aerospace, automobile, chemical plants and biomedical applications due to their very high strength and lightweight properties. However, corrosion is a life-limiting factor when Ti alloys are exposed to different chemical environments at high temperatures. In the present paper, duplex NiCrAlY/WC–Co coating is coated onto Ti 6 Al 4 V substrate to investigate the corrosion behavior of both coated samples and the substrate. The duplex coating was performed with NiCrAlY as the <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat</b> of 200  μm thickness deposited by HVOF process and WC–Co ceramic top coat with varying thicknesses of 250  μm, 350  μm and 450  μm deposited by DS process. Potentiodynamic polarization tests were employed to investigate the corrosion performance of duplex coated samples and substrate in Ringer’s solution at 37  °C and pH value was set to 5. 7. Finally the results reveal that 350  μm thick coated samples showed highest corrosion resistance compared to 250  μm thick samples as well as bare substrate. However, the 450  μm thick coated sample showed poor corrosion resistance compared to the substrate. The scale formed on the samples upon corrosion was characterized by using SEM analysis to understand the degree of corrosion behavior...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} this {{research}} may be summarized as follows. 1) Various arterioles found in the 6 groups of the structures of pig ovaries were divided into 14 types. 2) In this research all of normal vesicular follicles {{in the process of}} the maturation, mature ones and ones just before the rupture showed the same finding : i. e., newly formed arterioles and normal small ones were found only in the theca externa. 3) Atretic follicles were divided into 3 types. 4) At the early stage of regressive processes the findings of arterioles found in follicle walls {{are similar to those of}} normal vesicular follicles. At the middle stage new arterioles protrude actively from the theca externa into the theca interna. And at the last stage, according to the hyalinization of the inner walls of follicles, arterioles themselves in such parts come to undergo the hyaline swelling of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat,</b> and finally disappear gradually. 5) Corpora lutea of non-pregnancy were divided into 6 types. 6) At the vascularization stage of corpora lutea of this group, new arterioles protrude actively from the capsule into the lutein cell layer, and at the fullyformed stage these arterioles reach as far as in the deep portions of the lutein cell layers. At the beginning stage of the regressive process, normal arterioles with the marked internal elastic membrane are found in the periphery of the lutein cell layer. Arterioles with arteriosclerotic changes appear at the middle stage of the regressive process for the first time; namely relatively large arterioles under the capsule show increase of elastic fibers in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>coat.</b> At the last stage, with hyalinization of the interstitial tissues, arterioles themselves undergo hyaline swelling of the wall, and collapse gradually. 7) Vascular bodies were divided into 3 types. 8) Arterioles found in the vascular bodies show heavy arteriosclerotic changes in comparison with those of corpora lutea of non-pregnancy : that is to say they are found with conspicuous thickening of the internal elastic membrane and hyperplastic swelling of the inner coat. Only such arterioles remain in spite of the disappearance of lutein cells and of interstitial tissues according to the hyalinization, showing characteristic appearances as vascular bodies.
