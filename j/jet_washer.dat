40|$|Summary. Theoretical and {{experimental}} researches of extraction processes from plant origin raw materials: barley, acorns and chicory with liquid carbon dioxide, {{as well as}} lupin with cheese whey were carried out. Quality indicators of extracts and secondary raw materials are defined. It is established that they are perspective raw sources for the enriched and functional products as they contain amino acids, vitamins and microelements. The dairy-vegetative lupine extract, for example, contains 17 amino acids, including the essential as well as vitamins and minerals. The studies of secondary raw materials, barley, acorns, chicory and lupine quality showed the expediency of their use for foods enrichment. Quality indicators of secondary raw materials are presented in the tables form in the given work. It {{formed the basis for}} the development of hardware-technological schemes of obtaining СО 2 -extracts and their use. The hardware-technological scheme of obtaining СО 2 -extracts from barley, acorns and chicory includes a number of equipment units: motor transport for raw materials delivery to the enterprise, the scraper hydroconveyor, the <b>jet</b> <b>washer,</b> a photoseparator for of poor-quality raw materials and impurities removal, a blowing machine for removing surface moisture from the raw materials, a <b>jet</b> <b>washer</b> for peeling, a cutter, drying and frying device, a crusher, a roller machine tool and an extracting unit. Hardware providing for yoghurt technology enriched with amino acids, microelements and vitamins which are present in a dairy-plant extract differs from the mentioned above one in the following. The extract used is a cheese whey, and the extraction of a target component is carried out in a vibrating extractor. The hardwaretechnological scheme is made according to Russian technology of yoghurt and furnished with the equipment for dairy-vegetative extract feeding into a product. It includes the following: a vibrating extractor (not shown in fig. 2), the extract collector, the cover and tube heat exchanger and the refrigerator. Prerequisites reconditions are stated at a heat exchanger choice. The offered scheme can be used in the manufacture of other fermented milk products. Thus, the hardware-technological schemes developed by the authors contribute to the complex processing of secondary raw materials of plant origin which is economically and ecologically expedient...|$|E

5000|$|In 1976, {{the first}} prototypes were shown {{and under the}} new Soviet {{automobile}} numbering system, the car was christened as the GAZ-3101. Visually the vehicle included a completely new fascia, reminiscent of the more muscular fashion of North America, framed by East German built square headlights with water <b>jet</b> <b>washers,</b> a more angular chromed bumper with resin lining, fog lamps suspended below and the trademark [...] "Baleen" [...] grille. At the same time, conservative European influence can also be traced in the new rear panels, with a large tail-light cluster. As a measure of additional security, the fuel tank migrated behind the rear seat from its position under the boot, allowing the spare wheel to occupy its space. From the side, GAZ-24's profile remained, but doors now void of quarter glasses and featured sunken door handles in accordance to new standards of passive safety to pedestrians. Although the traditional chrome door mounted mirrors were retained, a provision was made for internal adjustment.|$|R
50|$|The 182 Cup {{lacked the}} {{automatic}} Xenon headlights and headlight <b>washer</b> <b>jets,</b> climate control (rear footwell heater vents were also removed), illuminated sun visors, Solar Reflective Windscreen and Automatic Wipers.|$|R
50|$|The top of {{the range}} Executive model was {{specified}} a ten speaker JBL sound system, electrically adjusted and heated leather seats, a memory position for the seats and mirrors, headlight <b>washer</b> <b>jets,</b> a rear sun blind, thicker carpeting, lights in the sun visors, satellite navigation and ambient lighting.|$|R
5000|$|A minor {{facelift}} on the 2005 {{model year}} featured redesigned {{front and rear}} aprons, a slightly modified grille, remodeled rear light clusters, an aluminium bonnet, and a new 2.7-litre V6 diesel engine with [...] The windscreen <b>washer</b> <b>jets</b> were incorporated into the windscreen wiper arms. There were no changes made to the cabin interior. 2006 to 2008 models featured no fog lights.|$|R
5000|$|The vast {{majority}} of cars were produced in D43 Mondial Blue (metallic) with a limited run of around 90 cars being produced in 640 Iceberg Silver (metallic). The Cup, originally built for Gr.N homologation of the Clio 172 was differentiated from the [...] "non cup" [...] 172 by its lack {{of many of the}} luxuries included in the regular car. Instead of the leather / Alcantara seats instead the same style seat was upholstered in a durable but low-cost fabric, the automatic Xenon headlights were replaced by manually controlled halogen units and the <b>washer</b> <b>jets</b> replaced with blanks. The rain sensing wipers and solar reflective coated windscreen were also omitted from the 172 Cup.|$|R
50|$|A <b>jet</b> spray <b>washer</b> cleans by {{flooding}} the parts with warm chemical solution and high chemical concentration {{to clean the}} parts. In the power wash process the parts are blasted with hot chemical solution utilizing the hydraulic impact force of the cleaning solution as the primary cleaning mechanism. A parts washer utilizing the power washer process operates at a very low concentration of cleaning detergent. The lower concentration causes the cleaning solution to last longer before it becomes supersaturated and requires disposal. Additionally, a low concentration of cleaning chemicals allows for easier rinsing of the detergent from the parts thereby minimizing rinse cycle requirements thus saving water and cycle time. A final factor used in the power wash process is an oscillating manifold system that is non-synchronous to {{the rotation of the}} turntable. This system assures that the blasted solution reaches all areas of the parts load that are otherwise blinded by the stationary manifolds used in the jet spray process. All things considered the power wash process is superior to the jet spray process for faster more thorough parts cleaning cycles while minimizing detergent use and waste generation. The power wash process is generally effective for difficult soil removal applications such as burnt hydrocarbons, paint, scale, varnish, carbon, mastic, or rubber. Additional power wash types of applications generally include cleaning diesel engines, aerospace components, aluminum automobile engine parts and rolling mill equipment.|$|R
5000|$|From 1993 through 1995, Porsche {{offered a}} lighter-weight [...] "Club Sport" [...] {{version of the}} 968 {{designed}} for enthusiasts seeking increased track performance. Much of the 968's luxury-oriented equipment was removed or taken off the options list; less sound deadening material was used, electrical windows were replaced with crank-driven units, upgraded stereo systems, A/C and sunroof were still optional as on the standard Coupe and Convertible models. In addition, Porsche installed manually adjustable lightweight Recaro racing seats rather than the standard power-operated leather buckets (also manufactured by Recaro), a revised suspension system optimized and lowered by 20 mm for possible track use, 17-inch wheels (also slightly wider to accommodate wider tires) rather than the 16-inch as found on the Coupe and wider tires, 225 front and 255 rears rather than 205 and 225 respectively. The four-spoke airbag steering wheel was replaced with a thicker-rimmed three-spoke steering wheel with no airbag, heated <b>washer</b> <b>jets</b> were replaced with non heated, vanity covers in the engine bay were deleted, as was the rear wiper. The Club Sport has no rear seats, unlike the 2+2 Coupé.|$|R
25|$|The contractor's {{locomotive}} {{was a small}} tank locomotive specially {{adapted for}} use by civil engineering contractor firms engaged {{in the building of}} railways. The locomotives would be used for hauling men, equipment and building materials over temporary railway networks built at the worksite that were frequently re-laid or taken up and moved elsewhere as building work progressed. Contractor's locomotives were usually saddle or well tank types (see above) but required several adaptations to make them suitable for their task. They were built to be as light as possible so they could run over the lightly built temporary rails and had deeply flanged wheels so they did not de-rail on the tracks which were often very uneven. At the same time they had to be very powerful with good traction as they would often have to haul trains of wagons up very steep gradients, such as the sides of railway embankments or spoil heaps. Many were designed so that large iron ballast blocks could be fitted to the frames when extra weight and traction was required, then removed when it was not. Most had sanding gear fitted to all wheels for maximum traction. Some method of keeping mud and dust from clogging the wheels and brake shoes was also required – this either took the form of scraper bars fitted to {{the leading edge of the}} wheels or wheel <b>washer</b> <b>jets</b> supplied from the water tank. To handle long trains of loose-coupled (and often un-sprung) wagons, contractor's locomotives usually had very effective steam-powered brakes. Most lacked a full cab, often only having a front 'spectacle plate'. If a cab was provided it was usually removable along with the chimney, and sometimes the dome, so that the locomotive could be loaded onto a flatbed wagon for transport to new locations by rail whilst remaining within the loading gauge.|$|R
