5|$|Paleontology {{seeks to}} map out how living things have changed through time. A {{substantial}} hurdle to this aim is the difficulty of working out how old fossils are. Beds that preserve fossils typically lack the radioactive elements needed for radiometric dating. This technique is our only means of giving rocks greater than about 50 million years old an absolute age, and can be accurate to within 0.5% or better. Although radiometric dating requires very careful laboratory work, its basic principle is simple: the rates at which various radioactive elements decay are known, and so {{the ratio of the}} radioactive element to the element into which it decays shows <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> the radioactive element was incorporated into the rock. Radioactive elements are common only in rocks with a volcanic origin, and so the only fossil-bearing rocks that can be dated radiometrically are a few volcanic ash layers.|$|E

25|$|In {{the genome}} of an organism, each gene {{is located at}} a {{specific}} place called the locus for that gene. Allelic variations at these loci cause phenotypic variation within species (e.g. hair colour, eye colour). However, most alleles {{do not have an}} observable impact on the phenotype. Within a population new alleles generated by mutation either die out or spread throughout the population. When a population is split into different isolated populations (by either geographical or ecological factors), mutations that occur after the split will be present only in the isolated population. Random fluctuation of allele frequencies also produces genetic differentiation between populations. This process is known as genetic drift. By examining the differences between allele frequencies between the populations and computing genetic distance, we can estimate <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> the two populations were separated.|$|E

500|$|Ida {{originated}} in {{the breakup of the}} roughly [...] diameter Koronis parent body. The progenitor asteroid had partially differentiated, with heavier metals migrating to the core. Ida carried away insignificant amounts of this core material. It is uncertain <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> the disruption event occurred. According to an analysis of Ida's cratering processes, its surface is more than a billion years old. However, this is inconsistent with the estimated age of the Ida–Dactyl system of less than 100 million years; it is unlikely that Dactyl, due to its small size, could have escaped being destroyed in a major collision for longer. The difference in age estimates may be explained by an increased rate of cratering from the debris of the Koronis parent body's destruction.|$|E

Law enforcement sources told KCNC-TV that one of the suspects [...] "was directly asked if they had come to Denver to kill Obama. He responded in the affirmative." [...] Johnson said Gartrell came to Denver to help Adolf execute the plan, and Gartrell later admitted to police that in talking about Obama, they referred to [...] "shooting on a grassy knoll," [...] a reference to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. An arrest warrant read, [...] "Adolf said that he wanted to kill Obama and additionally stated that he would specifically use a sniper rifle and high powered scope, and find high ground to set up and shoot Obama." [...] However, Johnson also told the reporter he {{came to the conclusion that}} there was assassination plot only after being questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation multiple times, adding, “I told them I had no idea there was a plot, a plan, a conspiracy or anything like that ... When the feds came and laid out everything on the table and how it looked, I was in agreement that they could have been up here to do something like that."

Bateman, with a bleeding heart, exulted at the prospect of giving happiness to the two persons he loved best in the world at the cost of his own. He would never marry.

2500|$|William Bass and his {{students}} did not isolate themselves through their own studies at the Body Farm; they also received forensic cases from law enforcement {{in which they could}} lend their expertise.

After using other various forensics on the body including bone examinations, Bass and his team were able to identify the victim. The only other question was <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> the victim had died; with this, they turned toward entomology, and more specifically, the life cycle of flies.
