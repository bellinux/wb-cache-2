5000|$|Ironstones {{consist of}} 15% iron {{or more in}} composition. This is {{necessary}} for the rock to even be considered an iron-rich sedimentary rock. Generally, they are from the Phanerozoic which means that they range in age from the present to 540 million years ago. [...] They can contain iron minerals from the following groups: oxides, carbonates, and silicates. Some examples of minerals in iron-rich rocks containing oxides are limonite, hematite, and magnetite. An example of a mineral in iron-rich rock containing carbonates is siderite and an example of minerals in an iron-rich rock containing silicate is chamosite. [...] They are often interbedded with limestones, shales, and fine-grained sandstones. They are typically nonbanded, however they can be very coarsely banded on occasion. [...] They are hard and noncherty. [...] The components of the rock range in size from sand to mud, but do not contain a lot of silica. They are also more aluminous. They are not laminated and sometimes contain ooids. Ooids can be a distinct characteristic though they are not normally a main component of ironstones. Within ironstones, ooids are made up of iron silicates and/or iron oxides and sometimes occur in alternating laminae. They normally contain fossil debris and sometimes the fossils are partly or entirely replaced by iron minerals. A good example of this is pyritization. They are smaller in size and less likely to be deformed or metamorphosed than iron formations. [...] The term iron ball is occasionally used to describe an <b>ironstone</b> <b>nodule.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A typical Tifton {{soil profile}} {{consists}} of an [...] topsoil of dark grayish brown loamy sand. The subsoil extends to about 65 inches, strong brown fine sandy loam to 22 inches; yellowish brown sandy clay loam to 40 inches; yellowish brown mottled, sandy clay loam to 60 inches, and strong brown, mottled sandy clay to 65 inches. Two distinctive features of the Tifton soil profile are the presence of more than 5 percent <b>ironstone</b> <b>nodules</b> in {{the upper part of}} the soil and more than 5 percent plinthite in the lower part of the soil.|$|R
50|$|The area of Poole Bay was {{predominantly}} {{created during}} the Pleistocene period, when the Solent river {{ran across the}} whole of South East Dorset and West Hampshire, out past the Isle of Wight The solid geology of the cliffs, and the seabed beneath Poole Bay, is composed of rocks of the Tertiary Bracklesham Group, consisting of a sequence of fine, medium and coarse sands. At Hengistbury Head there are younger rocks of the Bartonian group, forming an outlier. The Barton Clay here {{is made up of}} a series of sands and interbedded clays, with four distinct bands of <b>ironstone</b> <b>nodules.</b> These formations dip eastwards and are cut out by a north-west to south-east trending fault. This defines the eastwards boundary of Christchurch Ledge, which is a seawards continuation of the resistant ironstone strata exposed in Hengistbury Head.|$|R
5000|$|The {{strengths}} of the palaeontological collections reflect the geology of the local region, {{as well as the}} research interests of past and present University of Birmingham palaeontologists. One of the most important collections is of Silurian marine animals from the 428 million-year-old Wenlock Limestone of the Dudley area. The limestone records animals living in and around ocean floor reefs when the Midlands was covered by warm, shallow tropical seas. Fossils were primarily collected during the 18th and 19th century during quarrying of the limestone for use as flux during the production of iron. Key collections made in the 19th century by Charles Ketley and Sir Charles Holcroft were acquired by the Lapworth. The Lapworth also includes an important collection of graptolites, marine colonial organisms that are highly important for correlating and dating rocks, {{as a result of the}} work of Charles Lapworth, who was a leading expert on the group. Other key collections include: plants and animals from the Coal Measures of the South Staffordshire Coalfield, particularly those preserved in exceptional in <b>ironstone</b> <b>nodules</b> from Coseley; ice age mammals such as mammoth and cave bear; exceptionally preserved fish fossils from Brazil, Italy, Lebanon and the USA; and specimens from famous international fossiliferous deposits such as the Solnhofen Limestone of southern Germany and the Burgess Shale of British Columbia.|$|R
40|$|Calamitalean stems {{that are}} {{preserved}} in growth position in Carboniferous sedimentary deposits {{have been described}} {{many times in the}} literature as either pith casts or stem casts. Many of these in situ stems show branching, which gives some information on their patterns of growth. Their manner of preservation is discussed in the light of a new stand of well-preserved in situ stem and branch pith casts of Calamites discovered in mid to upper Duckmantian sandstone at Brymbo in the Wrexham Coalfield of North Wales. Analysis of a brown mineralized layer surrounding the casts and below the black compression remains of the stem tissues has shown the presence of goethite, muscovite, quartz and kaolin. Deposition of these minerals around the inside of the central stem cavity would have provided rigidity and sufficient support, while the pith cavity filled with sediments. The outer tissues would then have been compressed to form a thin coal layer around the mineralized infill of the pith cavity. Cross sections of stems were found clustered together in relatively small areas, and kernel density map and nearest neighbour analysis suggest that each small patch of these pith casts represents an individual plant spread by rhizomatous growth. Stems found in <b>ironstone</b> <b>nodules</b> are external casts of leafy stems preserved by the deposition of siderite on their surfaces. A length of rhizome found at Brymbo was similarly preserved as a cast in ironstone...|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that readily observed and easily measured morphological variables {{can be used to}} haracterize the soils sampled and described in southeastern Nigeria for purposes of land use and management. Field tests were developed for estimating soil texture and amount of <b>ironstone</b> <b>nodules.</b> Two new soil color indices provided an immediate means of diagnosing the soil drainage regime in case of the color index (CI) and soil forming processes in tropical soils in case of the redness index (RI). The indices correlated negatively with organic C content (R = - 0. 39) and positively with dithionite-extracted Fe 2 O 3 (0. 44) and Al 2 O 3 (0. 51). Inexpensive field tests for color, texture, and ironstone can be quantified using color indices and laboratory measurements. The local soil classification was quantified by means of color indices (RI, CI) and percentages of ironstone, sand, silt, and clay measured in the A horizon. A classification based on soil texture, ironstone, and color was used to define classes for the B horizon. The two first principal components (PC) extracted Corn soil morphological variables measured on the upper three horizons of 72 pedons explained 64. 7 % of the total variance. Nonhierarchical clustering performed on the two PCs produced seven clusters that compare well with the great groups of U. S. soil taxonomy. Principal component analysis on 20 soil chemical and morphological variables confirmed that soil texture, ironstone, and soil color account for most of the variation of the soils and provide an efficient means of characterizing tropical soils derived from sedimentary parent material. status: publishe...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Two sites were established in Harris County, Texas, to relate seasonal saturation to soil morphology, micromorphology, soil reduction potential (Eh), and iron phases; and to test a,a'-dipyridyl dye for field identification of iron-reduction. The Wockley soil is a Plinthic Paleudalf and the Katy soil is an Aquic Paleudalf. Both soils have shallow fine sandy loam surface soils, and clay loam subsoils, overlying buried clayey soils. Field evidence of saturation consisted of low-chroma soil colors, mottling, and iron and manganese segregations. <b>Ironstone</b> <b>nodules</b> are plentiful in upper Bt horizons of the Wockley soil, and plinthite occurs. The Katy soil has distinct sand-silt coats on ped faces of Btg horizons. Micromorphology shows iron being actively reduced in the upper profiles of both soils, through destruction of nodules, the presence of cuffent pore and void linings; and some fine soft agglomerations in the Katy soil. Some iron nodules are not being reduced, having sharp boundaries to the matrix, or clay coatings or plugs covering the nodules. Active and inactive features can occur in the same horizons. Pore and void linings were the most indicative field characteristics of saturation in the Wockley soil, while the sand-silt coats on ped faces were convincing evidence of saturation and reduction in the Katy soil. Micromorphology showed that field evidence in these soils must be interpreted cautiously. The incidence of high rainfalls over the study period exceeded the expected probabilities, implying that rare high rainfall events or sequences of events promote saturation and reduction, but continuing high rainfalls suggest that climatic probabilities need to be more thoroughly documented. Manganese was reduced when soils were at or above field capacity. Iron reduction could not be checked when the Wockley soil was saturated. The E horizon of the Katy soil seems prone to reduction of iron when water tables are present. Poorly crystalline free iron was very low in both soils. Highly crystalline free iron was more prevalent in high-chroma segments of the soils. The cl,a'-dipyridyl dye could not be fully tested; however it did not give false positive readings...|$|R
