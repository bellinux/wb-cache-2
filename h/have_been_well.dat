5|$|As King of the Isles, Lǫgmaðr faced {{significant}} {{opposition from}} factions supporting his younger brothers, Haraldr and Óláfr. At some point, the Islesmen {{are reported to}} have petitioned Muirchertach Ua Briain, King of Munster to select a temporary ruler in the region. This act may have been initiated {{on behalf of a}} faction supporting Óláfr. Whatever the case, Ua Briain responded by placing an Uí Briain relative upon the throne. The Uí Briain interlopers, however, do not appear to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>well</b> received; and were evidently ejected by the Islesmen, perhaps led by supporters of Lǫgmaðr himself.|$|E
5|$|In {{his final}} analysis, Tokushi Kasahara looks at {{documents}} and diaries recorded by {{soldiers of the}} Japanese Army and concludes that at least 80,000 Chinese soldiers and POWs, or possibly over 100,000, were massacred by the Japanese, which was most of the estimated total force of 150,000 soldiers. Kasahara notes that Smythe's survey proves that a bare minimum of 12,000 ordinary civilians were massacred within Nanking, though other contemporary sources gives figures between 50,000 and 100,000, plus at least another 26,870 outside Nanking. Kasahara generally concludes that the death toll must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>well</b> over 100,000, and possibly around 200,000. His more specific range of figures is roughly 160,000 to 170,000.|$|E

5|$|The Asiatic dayflower is {{considered}} a weed both in areas where it was introduced and {{in certain parts of}} its native range. The flowers' interactions with pollinators <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>well</b> studied and have helped to support important hypotheses about pollination in the field of plant ecology. Recent research has also revealed that the Asiatic dayflower can bioaccumulate a number of metals, making it a candidate for revegetating and essentially cleaning spoiled copper mines. Several animals and fungi use the plant as a food source, with a few species feeding upon it exclusively.|$|E

5|$|The {{brain of}} Allosaurus, as {{interpreted}} from spiral CT scanning of an endocast, was {{more consistent with}} crocodilian brains {{than those of the}} other living archosaurs, birds. The structure of the vestibular apparatus indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal, as opposed to strongly tipped up or down. The structure of the inner ear was like that of a crocodilian, and so Allosaurus probably could have heard lower frequencies best, and would have had trouble with subtle sounds. The olfactory bulbs were large and seem to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>well</b> suited for detecting odors, although the area for evaluating smells was relatively small.|$|E

5|$|Ancient {{people of}} Chamba {{were known to}} have worn a fine woolen blanket or chadar around the waist, to keep warm in the cold climate. It was often tied or girdled with a band or patka, as {{evidenced}} by some archaeological discoveries in the area depicting this fashion. The Gaddi people have traditionally worn white embroidered caps and loose-fitting white woolen garments known as a chola, tied around the waist with a black wool rope. A local custom in Chamba was to give the Jogi of the Natha sect a cotton maikhal sheet to wear over the head during the Nuwala ceremony to honour Lord Siva. Chamba and the surrounding district <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>well</b> documented as being a producer of fine cloth and embroidered dresses for centuries.|$|E
5|$|Checkpoint Proteins can be {{separated}} into four groups: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like protein kinase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-like group, two serine/threonine(S/T) kinases and their adaptors. Central to all DNA damage induced checkpoints responses {{is a pair}} of large protein kinases belonging to the first group of PI3K-like protein kinases-the ATM (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (Ataxia- and Rad-related) kinases, whose sequence and functions <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>well</b> conserved in evolution. All DNA damage response requires either ATM or ATR because they have the ability to bind to the chromosomes at the site of DNA damage, together with accessory proteins that are platforms on which DNA damage response components and DNA repair complexes can be assembled.|$|E

Nokian winter tyres have been described as a favourite of critics and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>well</b> received in winter test results by several publications. Nokian also has designed some winter tyre models with low rolling resistance, offering lower fuel consumption. Nokian was the first company to produce a tyre that allowed for year-round use by having different tread patterns on the lateral and medial aspect of the tread. One pattern is optimised for winter and another pattern is designed as an all-season pattern.|$|E
