5|$|Mansukhani {{conceived}} {{the film as}} a tale of three friends living together, drawing inspiration by his own experience. Wanting to add something different to the script, he later decided to introduce homosexuality (which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> unexplored by Bollywood) {{to shed light on}} the issue for the Indian audience. Manish Malhotra designed Chopra's costumes, and Aki Narula designed costumes {{for the rest of the}} cast. The soundtrack was composed by Vishal–Shekhar and Anvita Dutt Guptan; Kumaar and Vishal Dadlani wrote its lyrics.|$|E
5|$|McGivney {{traveled}} to Boston {{to examine the}} Massachusetts Catholic Order of Foresters and to Brooklyn, New York {{to learn about the}} recently established Catholic Benevolent League, both of which offered insurance benefits. He found the latter to be lacking the excitement <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> needed if his organization were to compete with the secret societies of the day. He explored establishing a New Haven Court of the Foresters, but the group's charter in Massachusetts limited them to operating within the Commonwealth. McGivney's committee of St. Mary's parishioners decided to form a new club.|$|E
60|$|Some {{critical}} spirit {{within him}} asked him urgently {{why he was}} going to the station, what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing, what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had done, and what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to do. To all of which questions Mr. Brumley perceived he had no adequate reply.|$|R

5|$|Morchella rufobrunnea is the morel that is {{cultivated}} commercially per US patents 4594809 and 4757640. This {{process was}} developed in 1982 by Ronald Ower with what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> Morchella esculenta; M.rufobrunnea {{had not yet been}} described. The cultivation protocol consists of preparing a spawn culture that is mixed with nutrient-poor soil. This mixture is laid on nutrient-rich soil and kept sufficiently moist until fruiting. In the nutrient-poor substrate, the fungus forms sclerotia—hardened masses of mycelia that serve as food reserves. Under appropriate environmental conditions, these sclerotia grow into morels.|$|E
5|$|The game's design also {{received}} acclaim. Carter from Destructoid {{thought that the}} fortress and the outpost system provided players {{with a sense of}} accomplishment and success, and he considered having the freedom to use different ways to approach and complete missions one of the greatest parts of the game. In addition, Carter applauded the game's driving mechanics and the auto-drive feature, which he considered a significant improvement for the series. However he criticized the upgrade system, which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> directly converted from Far Cry 3 and was uninspiring. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Harmon thought that the introduction of the helicopter was dull. Mitch Dyer, from IGN, praised the game's economy system, which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> satisfying. He added that it gives players motivations to complete side-quests. Justin McElroy of Polygon praised the introduction of the grappling hook and the vertical map-design, which he thought had allowed players to develop strategy before taking action. He also praised the game for allowing players to use multiple approaches towards a single objective.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} as Gomphidius vinicolor in 1898 by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck, based on specimens collected near Lake Mohonk in Ulster County, New York. Peck noted a resemblance to Gomphidius roseus, which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> closely related. It {{was transferred to}} the newly created genus Chroogomphus by Orson K. Miller, Jr. in 1964.|$|E

5|$|To further {{add to his}} confusion, he {{encountered}} a series of islands north of Abaco Island, which looks {{very similar to the}} Key West Islands. The control tower then suggested that Taylor's team should fly west, which would have taken them to the landmass of Florida eventually. Taylor headed for what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> west, but in reality was northwest, almost parallel to Florida.|$|E
5|$|Under Elijah's influence, David {{develops}} what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> {{an unusual}} insight into human behavior into an extrasensory perception that {{enables him to}} glimpse criminal acts committed {{by the people who}} make contact with him. At Elijah's suggestion, David {{stands in the middle of}} a crowd in Philadelphia's 30th Street Station. As various people bump into him, he senses the crimes they perpetrated, such as theft and rape, and finds one he can act on: a sadistic janitor who invades a family home, kills the father, and holds the wife and their two children captive.|$|E
5|$|In early September 1862, Colonel Lightburn {{became aware}} of rebel cavalry led by Colonel Albert G. Jenkins, which invaded Ohio. After a brief {{incursion}} into Ohio, Jenkins positioned his cavalry at Barboursville, which blocked one of Lightburn's possible routes {{to the safety of}} the Ohio River. Jenkins also prepared to move toward the Kanawha River and Charleston—which could block all of Lightburn's retreat routes to Ohio. Lightburn also received news that the Confederate General William W. Loring was advancing from the south with a force rumored to be between 8,000 and 10,000 men. (The actual number was 5,000 plus new recruits.) Lightburn faced the possibility of confronting an army (Loring) that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> much larger than his while having no easy way to retreat because of Jenkins.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, as {{the young}} {{discipline}} of organic chemistry began to grow in Europe, scientists attempted to isolate and purify the active components of many medicines, including willow bark. After unsuccessful attempts by Italian chemists Brugnatelli and Fontana in 1826, Joseph Buchner obtained relatively pure salicin crystals in 1828; the following year, Henri Leroux developed another procedure for extracting modest yields of salicin. In 1834, Swiss pharmacist Johann Pagenstecher discovered what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a new pain-reducing substance, isolated from the common remedy of meadowsweet (Spiraea ulmaria). By 1838, Italian chemist Raffaele Piria found a method of obtaining a more potent acid form of willow extract, which he named salicylic acid. The German chemist {{who had been working}} to identify the Spiraea extract, Karl Jacob Löwig, soon realized that it was in fact the same salicylic acid that Piria had found.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Taylor overshot Castaway Cay and instead reached another land mass in southern Abaco Island. He then proceeded northwest as planned. He fully expected to find the Grand Bahama Island lying {{in front of him}} as expected. Instead, he eventually saw a land mass to his right side, the northern part of Abaco Island. Believing that this landmass to his right was the Grand Bahama Island and his compass was malfunctioning, he set a course to what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> southwest to head straight back to Fort Lauderdale. However, in reality this changed his course farther northwest, toward open ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the element is credited to the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth. While he was working in his experimental laboratory in Berlin in 1789, Klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound (likely sodium diuranate) by dissolving pitchblende in nitric acid and neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide. Klaproth assumed the yellow substance was the oxide of a yet-undiscovered element and heated it with charcoal to obtain a black powder, which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> the newly discovered metal itself (in fact, that powder was an oxide of uranium). He named the newly discovered element after the planet Uranus (named after the primordial Greek god of the sky), which had been discovered eight years earlier by William Herschel.|$|E

5|$|As life in Paris {{returned}} to normal, in June 1871, Bizet's appointment as chorus-master at The Opéra was seemingly confirmed by its director, Émile Perrin. Bizet {{was due to}} begin his duties in October, but on 1 November, the post was assumed by Hector Salomon. In her biography of Bizet, Mina Curtiss surmises that he either resigned or refused {{to take up the}} position as a protest against what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> the director's unjustified closing of Ernest Reyer's opera Erostrate after only two performances. Bizet resumed work on Clarissa Harlowe and Grisélidis, but plans for the latter to be staged at the Opéra-Comique fell through, and neither work was finished; only fragments of their music survive. Bizet's other completed works in 1871 were the piano duet entitled Jeux d'enfants, and a one-act opera, Djamileh, which opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. It was poorly staged and incompetently sung; at one point the leading singer missed 32 bars of music. It closed after 11 performances, not to be heard again until 1938. On 10 July Geneviève gave birth to the couple's only child, a son, Jacques.|$|E
5|$|From a young age, Jackson {{was exposed}} to sex. He {{received}} mixed messages on the subject from his parents. His mother Katherine was a devout Jehovah's Witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly; lust in thought or deed was sinful outside of marriage, and physical intimacy should be saved for marriage. In contrast to his wife, father Joseph, a steel mill worker, shunned the religion and would have The Jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and seedy bars in {{the earliest days of}} their career. He allowed nine-year-old Michael to watch from the wings of the stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude. In one incident, a fascinated Michael watched as an apparently big breasted female removed all but her underwear. The stripper then proceeded to reach into her bra, removing two large oranges and the wig from her head, to reveal that the person <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> a female was not a woman at all.|$|E
5|$|It {{was these}} 1986 Giants that popularized the {{football}} tradition of dousing {{the head coach}} with a cooler of Gatorade {{near the end of}} a victorious game. This originally started in 1985 when Jim Burt, incensed by what <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> mistreatment he received in practice the week leading up to a game, exacted revenge on Bill Parcells by dumping a cooler of Gatorade on him after the Giants won that week's game. Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson later picked up on the ploy and would often sneak up on Coach Parcells near the end of games to dump the remaining Gatorade over his head. The dousing was a big hit with fans, and the Gatorade dumping would continue on throughout the season after each win, with Taylor, Carson, and several other players (Burt had since ceased doing it) concocting increasingly elaborate, sneaky and playful ruses, so as to at least attempt to keep the inevitable dousing a surprise.|$|E

5|$|Joe Mayer {{was fired}} in 1937. He {{attributed}} this to the hatred of women {{on the part of}} the dean of physical sciences, which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> provoked by Goeppert Mayer's presence in the laboratory. Herzfeld agreed and added that, with Goeppert Mayer, Franck and Herzfeld all at Johns Hopkins, some thought that there were too many German scientists there. There were also complaints from some students that Mayer's chemistry lectures contained too much modern physics. Mayer took up a position at Columbia University, where the chairman of the Physics Department, George B. Pegram, arranged for Goeppert Mayer to have an office, but she received no salary. She soon made good friends with Harold Urey and Enrico Fermi, who arrived at Columbia in 1939. Fermi asked her to investigate the valence shell of the undiscovered transuranic elements. Using the Thomas–Fermi model, she predicted that they would form a new series similar to the rare earth elements. This proved to be correct.|$|E
5|$|Like his heroes Swedenborg and Saint-Martin, Balzac {{attempts}} in Louis Lambert {{to construct a}} viable theory to unify spirit and matter. Young Lambert attempts this goal in his Traité de la Volonté, which – having been confiscated by a teacher – is described by the narrator:The word Will he used to connote... the mass of power by which man can reproduce, outside himself, the actions constituting his external life.... The word Mind, or Thought, which he regarded as the quintessential product of the Will, also represented the medium in which the ideas originate to which thought gives substance.... Thus the Will and the Mind were the two generating forces; the Volition and the Idea were the two products. Volition, <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>was</b> the Idea evolved from the abstract state to a concrete state, from its generative fluid to a solid expression.... According to him, the Mind and Ideas are the motion and the outcome of our inner organization, just as the Will and Volition are of our external activity. He gave the Will precedence over the Mind.The exploration of human will and thought is linked to Balzac's interest in Franz Mesmer, who postulated the theory of animal magnetism, a force flowing among humans. The narrator invokes Mesmer twice in the text, and describes {{a section of the}} Traité de la Volonté which reflects the animal-magnetic theory.|$|E
5|$|McBride & the Ride {{was created}} in 1989 when Tony Brown, then the {{executive}} vice president of MCA Records, decided to establish a new country music band in order to compete with Alabama, who <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>was</b> falling out of favor with country radio. At the time, guitarist Ray Herndon (born July 14, 1960) was serving as a backing musician for Lyle Lovett, then a recording artist for MCA. Brown suggested that Herndon join lead vocalist Terry McBride (born September 16, 1958), whom Herndon did not yet know, in the new band that Brown had planned. McBride, a musician since childhood, had worked as a backing musician for his father, Dale McBride, and later for Delbert McClinton and Rosie Flores. At the Fan Fair in Nashville, Tennessee, Brown introduced McBride and Herndon to drummer Billy Thomas (born October 24, 1953), who had previously played for Emmylou Harris and Mac Davis, and the band's lineup was in place. Brown had also chosen steel guitarist Steve Fishell to be a fourth member, but Fishell declined and chose to work as a record producer instead. The trio pitched their songs through the assistance of songwriters Bill Carter and Ruth Ellsworth, and four of those demos ended up on the band's first album.|$|E
