Each data frame consists of a start bit of 1, an 8-bit data field, a 3-bit station address, and an even parity bit (which includes the start bit, so it equivalent to odd parity over the data and address fields only). This is then followed by three or more <b>fill</b> <b>bits</b> of 0. Unusually for an IBM protocol, the bits within each frame are sent lsbit-first.|$|R

UDH eats room from the TP-UD field. When the message encoding is GSM 7 bit default alphabet and a UDH is present, <b>fill</b> <b>bits</b> are inserted to align start of the first character of the text after UDH with septet boundary.

40|$|When testing delay faults on {{critical}} paths, conventional structural test patterns may {{be applied in}} functionally-unreachable states, leading to over-testing or under-testing of the circuits. In this paper, we propose novel layout-aware pseudofunctional testing techniques to tackle the above problem. Firstly, by taking the circuit layout information into account, functional constraints related to delay faults {{on critical}} paths are extracted. Then, we generate functionally-reachable test cubes for every true critical path in the circuit. Finally, we <b>fill</b> the don’t-care <b>bits</b> in the test cubes to maximize power supply noises on critical paths under the consideration of functional constraints. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is verified with large ISCAS’ 89 benchmark circuits. ...|$|R

The eggs hatch in about two weeks and the larvae move {{to the base of}} the old needles and start to feed, only moving on to new needles if they exhaust the supply of old ones. The larvae construct silken webbing inside which they live in tubes, chewing off needles and pulling them inside the tubes for consumption; the tubes soon <b>fill</b> up with <b>bits</b> of needles, cast skins and frass. Older larvae construct their own individual tubes. By the end of June the larvae are fully developed and fall to the ground where they create earthen cells in which they spend the winter.|$|R
40|$|Copyright 2006 IEEEIn {{this paper}} a {{modified}} bit-filling algorithm {{is used for}} constructing column-weight two quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes with large girths. Code rows are divided into groups. A column is connected to two rows from different groups, which are apart by at least a specified minimum length. Rows that meet the minimum length are searched sequentially. Group rows are connected to consecutive columns resulting in a cyclic structure in the code matrix. Larger codes {{can be obtained by}} using larger row groups. Compared to other methods, the algorithm provides an easy and fast way to construct codes {{of a wide range of}} rates, girths and lengths. Constructed codes show good bit error rate performance. They are also easily implementable in hardware compared to those obtained using the original <b>bit</b> <b>filling</b> algorithm...|$|R

We improve the encoding by <b>filling</b> the don’t-care <b>bits</b> in the test stimuli, such that longer run-lengths are obtained. We provide a probabilis-tic analysis of the performance of vector repeat per port with various ATPG padding types. We further discuss the impact of ATE architectures.
