When the popular outcry against Spain arose in 1739, he was offered the command of ‘a stout squadron’ for the West Indies, but declined, believing the ministry not to be in earnest; nevertheless when his senior, Admiral Edward Vernon, who had been laid aside, was brought back over his head and sent out, Granard considered himself superseded, and refused to serve again.

Vernon returned to Parliament and continued to harass the government on naval affairs. In 1745, Vernon was promoted to Admiral and appointed to command the North Sea Fleet {{in response to the}} threat from the French forces in support of Charles Edward Stuart, [...] "Bonnie Prince Charlie". This was his last operational command. When the Admiralty refused to grant him the status of Commander-in-Chief, he asked to be relieved on 1 December 1745. Vernon's naval career had, however, a controversial ending. He wrote two pamphlets about his disagreements with the Admiralty. The first was entitled [...] "A Specimen of Naked Truth from a British Sailor" [...] and the second [...] "Some Seasonal Advice from an Honest Sailor".

40|$|This article uses {{correspondence}} analysis to visualize risk profiles and their changes {{over the time}} period 1977 to 2008. It {{is based on a}} unique dataset which combines incident data and ship particular data. The risk profiles can help stakeholders better understand the relationship of ship particulars, casualty types, incident locations, loss of life and pollution and link the results to developments of the legislative framework. The results demonstrate that the fleet improved their risk profiles over time reflecting legislative measures, port state control and vetting inspections. Older, general cargo ships <b>flagged</b> by black <b>listed</b> <b>flags</b> {{are most likely to be}} wrecked, stranded or grounded and remain risk prone towards flooding, foundering and capsizing. Some trading areas characterized by inter-regional trade operating outside the legislative framework remain risk prone. Most incidents do not involve loss of life or pollution. In terms of absolute figures, high risk prone areas for loss of life are the North and South China Sea, Japan and South Korea, the Mediterranean, Red and Black Sea and the Arabian Gulf. Casualty types which are more likely to lead to higher loss of life are flooding, foundering and capsizing on vessels which are <b>flagged</b> with black <b>listed</b> <b>flags.</b> For pollution, most oil pollution occurred in the area of the British Isles, the North Sea, the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay. High pollution quantities are more likely to be found due to collision and the vessel being wrecked, stranded and grounded than with other casualty types. maritime safety;ship risk profiles...|$|R

40|$|Most of the {{bankruptcy}} prediction models developed {{so far have}} in common that {{they are based on}} quantitative data or more precisely financial ratios. However, useful information can be lost when disregarding soft information. In this work, we develop an automated content analysis technique to assess {{the bankruptcy}} risk of companies using XBRL tags. We develop a list of potential red flags based on the U. S. GAAP taxonomy and assign the elements to 2 categories and 7 subcategories. Then we test our red <b>flag</b> item <b>list</b> based on U. S. GAAP annual reports of 26 companies with Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings and a control group. The empirical results show that in total, the red <b>flag</b> item <b>list</b> has predictive power of bankruptcy risk. Logistic regression results also show that the predictive power increases the nearer the bankruptcy filing date approaches. We furthermore observe that the category 2 red flags (bankruptcy characteristics and influencing factors) have higher discriminatory power than category 1 red flags (earnings management indicators) for one year before the bankruptcy filing date. This difference narrows for two years before the bankruptcy filing date and may turn in favor of category 1 red flags for three years before the bankruptcy filing date...|$|R
5000|$|Numerous claimants {{have accused}} {{the program of}} being used for {{discrimination}} targeting ethnic minorities.

After examining voter fraud suspect lists from some of the participating states, investigative reporter Greg Palast claimed the Crosscheck system [...] "disproportionately threatens solid Democratic constituencies: young, black, Hispanic and Asian-American voters" [...] with the intention of securing Republican victories. Palast concluded this was achieved by eliminating discrete individuals based on nothing more than similarity of name, a method with a [...] "built-in racial bias" [...] that especially eliminated voters from targeted minorities with a more limited pool of given names, for example, Hispanic voters named Jose Garcia. According to [...] "Health of State Democracies", [...] "50 percent of Communities of Color share a common surname, while only 30 percent of white people do," [...] so that in the Program's <b>flagged</b> <b>lists,</b> [...] "white voters are underrepresented by 8 percent, African Americans are overrepresented by 45 percent; Hispanic voters are overrepresented by 24 percent; and Asian voters are overrepresented by 31 percent".|$|R
