5|$|I {{would rather}} say I {{had won a}} race. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> been a person for bells and whistles.|$|E
5|$|I {{have been}} {{thinking}} how very gently I have always been dealt with. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> had a violent shove all my life. The only desire which I can have is like David to serve my own generation by the will of God, and then fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> {{mentioned}} the boy's name except to Probyn, Montagu and Knollys {{when they were}} acting for me and I thought they ought to know. Had they been wise, hearing what I knew and therefore what others knew, {{they ought to have}} hushed the matter up, instead of stirring it up as they did, with all the authorities.|$|E
5000|$|Donner's {{remark about}} winning from a dead-lost position: [...] "I couldn't resist saying {{something}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> said before {{after winning a}} game of chess. <b>I</b> may <b>have</b> thought it, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> said it. <b>I</b> said, 'Sorry.|$|R
60|$|The {{beating of}} my heart came back again. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> heard the voice, as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen the face, but it {{affected}} me in the same strange way. Again, in a moment, there arose before my mind innumerable pictures of myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that is so," [...] he {{answered}} quietly. [...] "That little room holds its secret and its ghost for me. Would to God," [...] he cried, {{with a sudden}} passion trembling in his tones, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen it--that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> come here!" ...|$|R
5|$|Their daughter, Scottie, wrote {{after their}} deaths: I think (short of {{documentary}} {{evidence to the}} contrary) that if people are not crazy, they get themselves out of crazy situations, so <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> been able to buy {{the notion that it}} was my father's drinking which led her to the sanitarium. Nor do I think she led him to the drinking.|$|E
5|$|While I {{have always}} {{believed}} that under the First and Fourteenth Amendments neither the State nor the Federal Government has any authority to regulate or censor the content of speech, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> believed that any person {{has a right to}} give speeches or engage in demonstrations where he pleases and when he pleases.|$|E
5|$|I've {{never had}} chills through my entire body like I had from hearing Beyoncé sing this song. 'I Was Here' came from my soul {{and became the}} song that was coming from hers. In all my life, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> heard {{anything}} as amazing as this. Hearing her sing 'I Was Here' will forever {{be one of the}} best moments of my life, and I know that this song will touch many other lives as well.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} {{the second}} hour I was tiring. There came a subtle change of spirit and mood. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> let up for a minute. Captain Dan praised me, vowed <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> fought either broadbill or roundbill {{swordfish}} so consistently hard, but he cautioned me to save myself.|$|R
60|$|It is {{needless to}} say how I vowed and protested that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> stirred; that it was quite impossible; that <b>I</b> could not <b>have</b> done it if I would, &c. I took all the saints to witness to my veracity, and swore <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen the outside of his {{tremendous}} castle.|$|R
60|$|The {{freshness}} of her beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribable majesty and its indescribable charm remained. Those attractions in it, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen before; what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen before, was the saddened, softened {{light of the}} once proud eyes; what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> felt before was the friendly touch of the once insensible hand.|$|R
5|$|Wiesenthal {{has been}} the subject of several documentaries. The Art of Remembrance: Simon Wiesenthal was {{produced}} in 1994 by filmmakers Hannah Heer and Werner Schmiedel for River Lights Pictures. The documentary <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Never</b> Forgotten You: The Life and Legacy of Simon Wiesenthal, narrated by Nicole Kidman, was released by Moriah Films in 2007. Wiesenthal is a one-person show written and performed by Tom Dugan that premiered in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Satchel {{was easier}} to catch. He could throw it in a quart cup. But Rogan {{was all over the}} plate—high, low, inside, outside. He'd walk five-six men, but he didn't give up many runs. Bullet had a little more steam on the ball than Paige—and he had a better-breaking curve. The batters thought it was a fastball heading for them and they would jump back from the plate and all of a sudden, it would break sharply for a strike. I would rank him with today's best. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> seen a pitcher like him, and I have caught some of the best {{pitchers}} in the business.|$|E
5|$|The {{argument}} that destruction and terror {{are part of}} revolution I do not dispute. I {{know that in the}} past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet {{it is one thing to}} employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E
60|$|I {{assured her}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> {{imagined}} such a thing possible.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a short}} silence. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen Rust so agitated.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{in a voice}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> heard, [...] <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> heard, My only Love to me: [...] "One word, [...] My lady, if you please! Whose is {{the child}} you are like to bear? - HIS? After all my months o' care?" [...] God knows 'twas not! But, O despair! [...] I nodded--still to tease.|$|R
5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> {{thought there}} was {{anything}} of beauty in the old negro's features, and, {{as a matter of}} fact, wrinkled and black as it was, one might truly have said that at times it was almost repulsive, yet as I saw him then it was as if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> looked upon anything more beautiful.|$|R
5000|$|... "The defeat which {{sticks in}} the memory is that 0-44 {{thrashing}} from the South Africans at Murrayfield on 24 November 1951. They were just awesome. It was like sevens played by fifteen men. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen anything quite like them. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen a prop forward run as fast as Chris Koch, <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen as huge a man as Okey Geffin kick goals...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> thought. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> {{noticed the}} point before, {{but he was}} right.|$|R
25|$|I {{must say}} that in all my conversations with you...during the last nine months <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> uttered one word of untruth. This is borne out {{absolutely}} by the record. In all my fifty years of public service <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> seen a document that was more crowded with infamous falsehoods and distortions--infamous falsehoods and distortions on a scale so huge that I never imagined until today that any Government on this planet was capable of uttering them.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> {{been more}} annoyed than by Slade's affair. Our {{officers}} of cavalry have acquired the trick of galloping at everything. They never consider the situation, {{never think of}} manoeuvring before an enemy, and never keep back or provide for a reserve.|$|E
25|$|She grows daily weaker. The physician's {{opinion was}} {{expressed}} too obscurely {{to be of}} use – he sent some medicine which she would not take. Moments so dark as these <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> known – I pray for God's support to us all.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> a more decided {{inclination}} to go loose, yet <b>I</b> know <b>I</b> <b>had</b> better keep quiet.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> {{been used}} {{due to its}} visual {{similarity}} to the number 1.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> {{suspected}} {{that this was}} coming, and was amazed to hear it.|$|R
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> {{been able}} to prefer a {{government}} without social democrats over one with them, as evident {{as it may be}} that one cannot entertain all company. I still think that the refusal to accept government responsibility in 1913 {{is one of the most}} significant errors the SDAP ever made.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> {{come across}} another umpire {{so full of}} his own importance, so stubborn, lacking in humour, {{unreasonable}} and utterly unable to distinguish between a delivery short of a length which rises around {{the height of the}} rib cage and a genuine bouncer which goes through head high, as Lou Rowan".|$|E
25|$|This {{country has}} been good to me. It gave me {{everything}} I have. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> come out for any candidate before but I think Wendell L.

60|$|I {{looked at}} him curiously. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> {{understood}} his insistence on that point.|$|R

60|$|KEEGAN. When I went {{to those}} great cities I saw wonders <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen in Ireland. But when I {{came back to}} Ireland I found all the wonders there waiting for me. You see they had been there all the time; but my eyes <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been opened to them. I {{did not know what}} my own house was like, because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> been outside it.|$|R
