5|$|Cattle raising was {{the major}} {{industry}} in the 1840s with sheep becoming predominant in the 1860s. At this time many Victorians settled in the Riverina to breed sheep and cattle to feed the miners {{taking part in the}} Victorian Gold Rush. The herds were considered inferior at first, but these pastures were good for stock, and the land which seemed a desert was actually good <b>fattening</b> country.|$|E
5|$|The Maya had few {{domestic}} animals; {{dogs were}} domesticated by 3000 BC, and the Muscovy duck by the Late Postclassic. Ocellated turkeys were unsuitable for domestication, but were rounded {{up in the}} wild and penned for <b>fattening.</b> All of these were used as food animals; dogs were additionally used for hunting. It is possible that deer were also penned and fattened.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, the warbler eats insects {{as well as}} berries, and {{the fruits}} of the {{introduced}} Spanish flag is a favourite where present. An increase in body mass occurs again before the northward migration, birds <b>fattening</b> even more rapidly than prior to their southward journey. Most internal organs (including the liver, spleen, intestines, kidneys and heart) and the flight muscles lose weight during the journey over the Sahara, although the testes quadruple in mass in preparation for the breeding season. Unlike drier-habitat species like the common whitethroat, they leave from savanna rather than the treeless Sahel further north.|$|E

5000|$|Cattle called [...] "corn-fed," [...] "grain-fed", or [...] "corn-finished" [...] are {{typically}} <b>fattened</b> on maize, soy, {{and other types}} of feed for several months before slaughter. As a high-starch, high-energy food, corn decreases the time to <b>fatten</b> cattle and increases carcass yield. Some corn-fed cattle are <b>fattened</b> in concentrated animal feeding operations known as feed lots.|$|R
5|$|In the {{developed}} world, {{the majority of}} the poultry reared for meat is raised indoors in big sheds, with automated equipment under environmentally controlled conditions. Chickens raised in this way are known as broilers, and genetic improvements have meant that they can be grown to slaughter weight within six or seven weeks of hatching. Newly hatched chicks are restricted to a small area and given supplementary heating. Litter on the floor absorbs the droppings and the area occupied is expanded as they grow. Feed and water is supplied automatically and the lighting is controlled. The birds may be harvested on several occasions or the whole shed may be cleared at one time. A similar rearing system is usually used for turkeys, which are less hardy than chickens, but they take longer to grow and are often moved on to separate <b>fattening</b> units to finish. Ducks are particularly popular in Asia and Australia and can be killed at seven weeks under commercial conditions.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after their}} debut, the ads {{came under fire}} from several fronts. Fans complained that the legendary {{musician}} was debasing himself by doing the commercials, that he was selling out by allowing his image {{to be used to}} peddle fast food. Other groups such as the American Diabetes Association pointed out that King, known for having weight issues and poorly controlled diabetes, was a questionable spokesperson for a burger chain that sells products that are not part of a healthier diet. Finally, several firms complained off the record that King was inconsistent in his endorsements, selling a highly <b>fattening</b> product while similarly endorsing diabetic products manufactured by the Johnson & Johnson company.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into nine {{chapters}} with seven appendices. The first chapter details the pig and its use in antiquity before summarizing the nutrient components of pork in comparison to beef. The second chapter opens with the defining characteristics of a good bacon pig. The six principal breeds of the United Kingdom {{at the time were}} the Large White Yorkshire, the Middle White, the Tamworth, the Berkshire, the Lincolnshire Curly-Coated and the Large Black. The Large White Yorkshire breed is traced to Robert Bakewell and highlights the importance of the breed for its quick maturity, rapid <b>fattening</b> and providing a long side. Though also credited for the breeding of the Small White pig, Bakewell was secretive in his work and evidence of his pig breeding (as a whole) cannot be confirmed. Nicholls describes the other breeds and provides information on the number of pigs, the state of the industry and the classification of pigs for the market.|$|E

5|$|The {{preferred}} breeding {{habitat in}} Eurasia is open woodland with dense low cover for nesting; despite its name, gardens are rarely occupied by this small passerine bird. The clutch {{of four or}} five blotched cream or white eggs is laid in a robust cup-shaped nest built near the ground and concealed by dense vegetation. The eggs are incubated for 11–12days. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 10days after hatching. Only about a quarter of young birds survive their first year. The garden warbler is strongly migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. A wide range of habitats are used in Africa, but closed forest and treeless Sahel are both shunned. Insects are the main food in the breeding season, although fruit predominates when birds are <b>fattening</b> prior to migration, figs being a particular favourite where available. These warblers have a mixed diet of insects and fruit in their African wintering grounds.|$|E

40|$|Animal welfare {{during the}} {{transport}} of <b>fattened</b> cattle has {{a significant effect on}} the likelihood of mortality or poor meat quality. The number of animals that died during transport to a slaughterhouse or briefly after being delivered to a slaughterhouse may serve as an indicator of animal welfare during transport. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the mortality in <b>fattened</b> cattle resulting from transport to a slaughterhouse, and to examine the effect of both travel distance and the season of the year on the mortality rate in <b>fattened</b> cattle during transport. The mortality rate in <b>fattened</b> cattle during transport to a slaughterhouse that were monitored in the Czech Republic in the period of 1997 - 2004 was 0. 007 % ± 0. 003 %. However, it varied significantly (p < 0. 05, r = 0. 90) with the travel distance to a slaughterhouse, ranging from 0. 004 % ± 0. 002 % at a travel distance up to 50 km to 0. 024 % ± 0. 027 % at a travel distance over 300 km. The season of the year also had a significant impact on the mortality rate in transported <b>fattened</b> cattle. In general, the highest mortality rate was observed in summer months (particularly in July and August) and winter months (particularly in January and February). Correlation (r = 0. 68) was proved (p < 0. 01) between the mortality rate in <b>fattened</b> cattle and ambient temperature. The results indicate relatively low sensitivity of <b>fattened</b> cattle to stress during transport, whic...|$|R

IN cases where there are several <b>fattening</b> pens, the smaller snails are placed in one, medium in another, large in another. One-third of a pound of H. aspersa snails require one square foot of pen. Snails lose weight when they estivate in summer, therefore some growers do not stock pens by weight but by count. For H. aspersa, 10 to 12 snails per square foot is the maximum.|$|E
