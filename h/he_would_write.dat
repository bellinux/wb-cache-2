5|$|After {{the project}} was accepted, Hinoue {{consulted}} Key's former main scenario writer Jun Maeda on various game scenario writers to employ for Rewrite. However, the one writer Hinoue wanted on {{the project was}} Romeo Tanaka, who {{she had become a}} fan of after she played FlyingShine's 2003 visual novel Cross Channel, written by Tanaka. While he did not initially accept the offer, Tanaka decided to take the project when he was given the time he needed to do the job.

5|$|Icke visited Shine four times. During {{the third}} meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke felt {{something}} like a spider's web on his face, and Shine told him she had a message from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world. Icke {{had been sent to}} heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>write</b> five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine would allow us to go wherever we wanted and time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilized by having oil taken from the seabed.|$|E
5|$|Walton's orchestral {{works of}} the 1960s include his Second Symphony (1960), Variations on a Theme by Hindemith (1963), Capriccio burlesco (1968), and Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten (1969). His song cycles from this period were {{composed}} for Peter Pears (Anon. in Love, 1960) and Schwarzkopf (A Song for the Lord Mayor's Table, 1962). He was commissioned to compose a score for the 1969 film Battle of Britain, but the film company rejected most of his score, replacing it with music by Ron Goodwin. A concert suite of Walton's score was published and recorded after Walton's death. After his experience over Battle of Britain, Walton declared that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>write</b> no more film music, but he was persuaded by Olivier to compose the score for a film of Chekhov's Three Sisters in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Wodehouse worked {{extensively}} on his books, sometimes having {{two or more}} in preparation simultaneously. He would take {{up to two years}} to build a plot and write a scenario of about thirty thousand words. After the scenario was complete <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>write</b> the story. Early in his career he would produce a novel in about three months, but he slowed in old age to around six months. He used a mixture of Edwardian slang, quotations from and allusions to numerous poets, and several literary techniques to produce a prose style that has been compared with comic poetry and musical comedy. Some critics of Wodehouse have considered his work flippant, but among his fans are former British prime ministers and many of his fellow writers.|$|E

5|$|As the game's {{dialogue}} {{consists of}} a lot of wordplay and misunderstandings, Smith would analyze scenes before writing them: he would see what the scenes were trying to accomplish, and where the beats in them were. After he had the structure of a scene in his head, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>write</b> it; at times he was able {{to make use of the}} original Japanese dialogue, but most of the time he had to come up with new ideas himself. At several points, the English wordplay was inspired by the wordplay in the Japanese version. At some points, it was not possible to do wordplay in the same places as in the Japanese version, so Smith would change the structure of the scene slightly. At other points, Smith came up with a joke or funny line, and changed the scene to make the joke work. Around half of the jokes were rewritten based on the characters present in the scene, rather than being translations of the Japanese jokes.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{explained}} {{in his memoirs}} that Mikhaíl Azanchevsky had taken over that year {{as director of the}} Conservatory, and wanting new blood to freshen up teaching in those subjects, had offered to pay generously for Rimsky-Korsakov's services. Biographer Mikhail Zetlin suggests that Azanchevsky's motives might have been twofold. First, Rimsky-Korsakov was the member of the Five least criticized by its opponents, and inviting him to teach at the Conservatory may have been considered a safe way to show that all serious musicians were welcome there. Second, the offer may have been calculated to expose him to an academic climate in which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>write</b> in a more conservative, Western-based style. Balakirev had opposed academic training in music with tremendous vigor, but encouraged him to accept the post to convince others to join the nationalist musical cause.|$|E
5|$|Available {{evidence}} indicates that the real Lad was born in December 1902, and that unlike his fictional counterpart, Lad was a collie of unknown lineage with no American Kennel Club registration papers. After living five years with a heart tumor, the dog died on September 3, 1918 and his obituary was featured on a multi-page spread of the September 14, 1918 issue of Field and Fancy magazine. Terhune reported that he received hundreds of letters from fans asking him to publish more stories about Lad, and that over 1,700 people visit Lad's grave at Sunnybank. In 1922, he collected together eleven more short stories into a novel; the stories were published earlier in The Ladies' Home Journal, with some new stories and some from other magazines. The new set of stories primarily revolved around the themes of right and wrong, abuse of authority, and justice. Intending {{it to be the}} last book <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>write</b> about his late collie, Terhune killed the fictional Lad in the last chapter of the novel. The novel was published by George H. Doran as Further Adventures of Lad. Seven years and twenty other novels later, he would change his mind and release one more Lad novel, Lad of Sunnybank, which was published by HarperCollins.|$|E
