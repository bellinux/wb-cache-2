5|$|When Large {{volunteered for}} the SAS in 1957 {{it was not a}} unit that was well known outside of {{military}} circles– a fact that Large took advantage of by initially telling <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>that</b> the Regiment's job was to air drop supplies to troops in the jungle.|$|E
5|$|Black {{rushes to}} Beebe's home, knowing the dogs will attack it. Beebe refuses to leave, {{but the house}} has been {{surrounded}} by five dogs; as they are killed they are seemingly endlessly replaced by others. The Old Man arrives, and insists {{the only way to}} rid the town of the dogs is burn down Beebe's house, which the trio do before fleeing. Back home in Seattle, Black refuses to sell his own home, telling <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>that</b> they will move back into it together when their problems are resolved.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{remained}} at court until October, apparently restored to favour. In {{the absence of}} any children, Philip was concerned that one of the next claimants to the English throne after his sister-in-law was the Queen of Scots, who was betrothed to the Dauphin of France. Philip persuaded <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>that</b> Elizabeth should marry his cousin Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, to secure the Catholic succession and preserve the Habsburg interest in England, but Elizabeth refused to comply and parliamentary consent was unlikely.|$|E

At home, Black learns that his daughter has been having vivid nightmares {{about the end of}} the world, in which she and her parents are isolated in a woodland cabin. Black admits to <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>that</b> he has come to accept the Group as a cult, and wishes to leave.

5|$|Like {{many people}} of his generation, Ochs deeply admired President John F. Kennedy, even though he {{disagreed}} {{with the president on}} issues such as the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the growing involvement of the United States in the Vietnamese civil war. When Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Ochs wept. He told <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>that</b> he {{thought he was going to}} die that night. It was the only time she ever saw Ochs cry.|$|E
5|$|As the {{rationalisation}} programme was winding down, Sjarifuddin began gathering {{soldiers from}} the Socialist Party, Communist Party, {{and members of the}} All Indonesia Centre of Labour Organizations for a would-be proletarian revolution in Madiun, East Java, which occurred on 18September 1948. Sudirman, ill at the time, sent Nasution to deal with the revolution; Sudirman also sent two other officers as peace feelers before the attacks. Although the revolutionary leader Muso was amenable to peace, Nasution and his soldiers had quashed the uprising by 30September. Sudirman visited Madiun not long after the battle, later telling <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>that</b> he had been unable to sleep there for all the bloodshed.|$|E

5|$|Balzac {{began using}} {{characters}} from earlier works in his 1835 novel Le Père Goriot, {{and made the}} technique a hallmark of his fiction. In the case of Z. Marcas, the narrator– Charles Rabourdin, whose identity is only revealed {{at the end of}} the story– is in fact the son of a central character from Balzac's 1837 tale La Femme supérieure. The title character of that story is married to Xavier Rabourdin, who is unjustly ignored for a promotion to the head of his civil service department. At the end of the La Femme supérieure, Rabourdin pledges to <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>that</b> they will enjoy success in the world of business. His son's poverty in Z. Marcas is evidence of his failure.|$|E
5|$|For {{eight months}} over 1875–76, the Prince of Wales was absent from Britain {{on a tour}} of India, but to her dismay Alexandra was left behind. The prince had planned an all-male group and {{intended}} to spend much of the time hunting and shooting. During the prince's tour, one of his friends who was travelling with him, Lord Aylesford, was told by <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>that</b> she was going to leave him for another man: Lord Blandford, who was himself married. Aylesford was appalled and decided to seek a divorce. Meanwhile, Lord Blandford's brother, Lord Randolph Churchill, persuaded the lovers against an elopement. Now concerned by the threat of divorce, Lady Aylesford sought to dissuade her husband from proceeding but Lord Aylesford was adamant and refused to reconsider. In an attempt to pressure Lord Aylesford to drop his divorce suit, Lady Aylesford and Lord Randolph Churchill called on Alexandra and told her that if the divorce was to proceed they would subpoena her husband as a witness and implicate him in the scandal. Distressed at their threats, and following the advice of Sir William Knollys and the Duchess of Teck, Alexandra informed the queen, who then wrote to the Prince of Wales. The prince was incensed. Eventually, the Blandfords and the Aylesfords both separated privately. Although Lord Randolph Churchill later apologised, for years afterwards the Prince of Wales refused to speak to or see him.|$|E

Churchill believed that he had “special knowledge” {{and an ability to}} improvise solutions, but others saw it as megalomania.|$|E

To prevent this he tells <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>that</b> he will have both Banco and his son murdered as they come to a banquet.|$|E

25|$|Li {{turned down}} Chow Yun-fat's role in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) because he promised <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> <b>that</b> {{he would not}} make any films during her pregnancy.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to his father, Louis the Younger preferred reconciling royal interests {{with those of the}} nobility and avoided confrontation. He managed to bind powerful families to the king, including the Luidovingian relatives of <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> <b>that</b> later themselves became kings and emperors. Louis mostly stayed in the Rhineland, avoiding Saxony or his eastern borders. Louis did visit Bavaria on two occasions, but mostly left it to the government of his illegitimate nephew, Carloman's son, Arnulf, Duke of Carinthia.|$|E
