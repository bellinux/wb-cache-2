Common methodological approaches and criteria for evaluating public health risk are determined, which are used in the development and application of food safety requirements. Risk assessment can be used in justifying the indicators of safety (contaminants, food additives), and evaluating the effectiveness of programs on enrichment of food with micronutrients...|$|R

The received proposals will be firstly selected by the Scientific Committee {{on the basis of}} innovation degree sectorial interest and then will be published in the constantly up-dated on-line catalogue. There will then be the opportunity to request individual meetings filling out the form of request for contact available in the on-line catalogue next to each technology offer and request.

40|$|The {{sustainable}} organizational {{change has}} an ever increasing importance, {{leading to the}} rethinking of the management and systems of performance measurement and monitoring within the companies. As a reaction to current economic phenomena, {{in the first section}} of this work we tried to bring out the need for using the couple Balanced Scorecard - Corporate Social Responsibility by companies. Thus, companies involved in sustainable actions must grant a great importance to the impact of environmental, social and economic factors in providing added value, <b>informing</b> <b>the</b> <b>interested</b> <b>parties</b> and reflecting <b>the</b> reporting of sustainable performance. As a consequence, {{in the second part of}} the work we present the Sustainability Balanced Scorecard for the implementation of efficient strategies which cumulate the economic, social and environmental aspects as integrating system for sustainable performance and as a new challenge for organizational change. The key performance indicators included in the Sustainability Balanced Scorecard are quantified by the indicators of sustainable development, based on which the empirical research described in the third section of the work was achieved. Through the quantitative analysis of the economic and ecological indicators (Gross Domestic Product per capita, respective, Environmental Performance Index) in correlation with the social indicator (Global Competitive Index), we conclude that the implementation of green strategies by companies leads to sustainable economic growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{foreclosure}} {{of property}} tax liens performs an essential economic function by reconnecting underutilized properties {{to the real}} estate market. To clear title in an efficient and just manner, local jurisdictions foreclosing on tax liens require clear, balanced procedures {{for the provision of}} notice to affected parties. In its 2006 decision in Jones v. Flowers, the U. S. Supreme Court found that the foreclosing jurisdiction 2 ̆ 7 s lack of direct follow-up on returned notice mailings denied the addressee due process because the foreclosing party did not take steps that would be chosen by one desirous of actually <b>informing</b> <b>the</b> property owner. In subjecting to direct constitutional review the myriad notification decisions a foreclosure petitioner must make in conducting diligent attempts at notification, Jones, though rightly decided, threatens the validity of tax foreclosure proceedings and the titles that result from them in a fundamentally different way than earlier precedents that made notification more rigorous without loss of clarity. After demonstrating the Court 2 ̆ 7 s historical use of rules and standards in this area of notice and opportunity to be heard, this Article will show how the development of constitutional safe harbors can be used to resolve the shortcomings of the rule/standard dichotomy. Deploying a theoretical framework for the judicial fostering of fair and efficient constitutional safe harbors, this Article advocates legislative enactment of and judicial support for detailed notification protocols tailored to the particular needs and behaviors of the different types of land interest holders entitled to foreclosure notice. In order to provide reliable guidance to foreclosing parties, these notice procedures should be designed to meet a higher standard developed in the Court 2 ̆ 7 s due process jurisprudence. If a court finds a set of legislated protocols reasonably certain to <b>inform</b> <b>the</b> <b>interested</b> <b>parties</b> for whom they were designed, then that court should judge the constitutionality of notification choices that come before it against that certified rule. Such an approach would be preferable to reviewing those decisions directly using vague, albeit generally less restrictive, constitutional standards such as reasonably calculated... to apprise or chosen by one desirous of actually informing. Notification protocols that meet this due process super standard of reasonable certainty can become safe harbors for those pursuing tax foreclosure remedies while still assuring full compliance with the guarantees of notice and opportunity to be heard embodied in constitutional jurisprudence. due process, notice and opportunity to be heard, tax foreclosure, constitutional safe harbor, rules, standards, pliability rule...|$|R

40|$|Many {{situations}} {{arise in}} which an <b>interested</b> <b>party’s</b> utility {{is dependent on the}} actions of an agent; e. g., a teacher is interested in a student learning effectively and a firm is interested in a consumer’s behavior. We consider an environment in which <b>the</b> <b>interested</b> <b>party</b> can provide incentives to affect the agent’s actions but cannot otherwise enforce actions. In value-based policy teaching, we situate this within the framework of sequential decision tasks modeled by Markov Decision Processes, and seek to associate limited rewards with states that induce the agent to follow a policy that maximizes the total expected value of <b>the</b> <b>interested</b> <b>party.</b> We show value-based policy teaching is NP-hard and provide a mixed integer program formulation. Focusing in particular on environments in which the agent’s reward is unknown to <b>the</b> <b>interested</b> <b>party,</b> we provide a method for active indirect elicitation wherein the agent’s reward function is inferred from observations about its response to incentives. Experimental results suggest that we can generally find the optimal incentive provision in a small number of elicitation rounds...|$|R
