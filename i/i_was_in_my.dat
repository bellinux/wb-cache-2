500|$|In {{part due}} to its dual printing, [...] "The Raven" [...] made Edgar Allan Poe a {{household}} name almost immediately, and turned Poe into a national celebrity. Readers began to identify poem with poet, earning Poe the nickname [...] "The Raven". The poem was soon widely reprinted, imitated, and parodied. Though it made Poe popular in his day, it did not bring him significant financial success. As he later lamented, [...] "I have made no money.

In a Spin interview, Lee called the record [...] "fun", which, according to her, was a [...] "totally new thing" [...] for the band: [...] "When I listen to our old music I see that's where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life at that time.

In March his program Ra'is el-Tahrir ("Editor-in-Chief") began airing. Qandil stated he returned to Egyptian television because he felt he owed [...] "a debt of gratitude to the institution that built my fame when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> twenties. Also, working in Egypt is more immediately rewarding than anywhere else." [...] With the relaxation of media restrictions during this period, Ra'is el-Tahrir {{became one of the}} most popular and respected television programs in Egypt. Describing the relative freedom afforded to the media, Qandil stated in 2001 that the situation was an improvement from when he first began the program, but [...] "as long as there remains a censor, we will continue to ask for more [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2009 interview, Sevigny {{reflected}} on her career, {{and said she}} was content with the level of stardom she had maintained: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> early 20s, I went out with a British pop star, Jarvis Cocker; of course, pop stars have much more celebrity, I think, than actors even. They're really hunted by their fans much more. I remember driving around these remote towns in Wales and kids running after us in the street. I was like, 'This is horrible!' And I saw the effect it had on him, and that's when I decided I never wanted to be a celebrity at that level, and I think that's why I've chosen to do the work that I do and just kind of work with directors that I love and try and do work that means something to me." ...|$|E

In an interview with The New York Post following the film's release, Baker commented on her role, saying: [...] "It's an important movie and I'm honored to be in it. Of course, I'd {{like to be the}} romantic lead, and I'm actually closer to Michael's [...] age than Deborah Kara Unger is, [...] I think it's always worked that way in Hollywood. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> 20s, I played opposite Jimmy Stewart, Robert Mitchum, and Clark Gable, all of whom were old enough to be my father." [...] The Game proved to be a major success among Baker's later films, performing successfully at the box office and garnering widespread critical acclaim.|$|E

Competing against Bruno Brodd of the Irish American Athletic Club and J. Bredemus of Princeton University, he won seven of the ten events contested and came in second in the remaining three. With a total point score of 7,476points, Thorpe broke the previous record of 7,385points set in 1909, (also set at Celtic Park), by Martin Sheridan, the champion athlete of the Irish American Athletic Club.

500|$|Nevelson {{continued}} to utilize wood in her sculptures, but also experimented with other {{materials such as}} aluminum, plastic and metal. [...] Black Zag X from 1969, {{in the collection of}} the Honolulu Museum of Art is an example of the artist's all-black assemblages incorporating the plastic, Formica. [...] In the fall of 1969, she was commissioned by Princeton University to create her first outdoor sculpture. After completion of her first outdoor sculptures, Nevelson stated: [...] "Remember, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> early seventies when I came into monumental outdoor sculpture... I had been through the enclosures of wood. I had been through the shadows. I had been through the enclosures and come out into the open." [...] Nevelson also praised new materials like plexiglas and cor-ten steel, which she described as a [...] "blessing". She embraced the idea of her works being able to withstand climate change and the freedom in moving beyond limitations in size. These public artworks were created by the Lippincott Foundry. Nevelson's public art commissions were a monetary success, but art historian Brooke Kamin Rapaport states that these pieces were not Nevelson's strongest works, and that Nevelson's [...] "intuitive gesture" [...] is not evident in the large steel works.|$|E
