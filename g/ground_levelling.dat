40|$|Differential SAR-Interferometry (D-InSAR) {{is one of}} the {{potential}} source to measure land surface motion induced due to underground coal mining. However, this technique has many limitation such as atmospheric in homogeneities, spatial de-correlation, and temporal decorrelation. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry synthetic aperture radar (PS-InSAR) belongs to a family of time series InSAR technique, which utilizes the properties of some of the stable natural and anthropogenic targets which remain coherent over long time period. In this study PS-InSAR technique has been used to monitor land subsidence over selected location of Jharia Coal field which has been correlated with the <b>ground</b> <b>levelling</b> measurement.

30|$|We {{compare the}} {{geodetic}} PS-InSAR {{results to the}} <b>ground</b> <b>levelling</b> measurements at ten sites around the geothermal plant between mid- 2013 and 2014 (see Figure  4). The PS-InSAR time series {{is the result of}} the mean value of PS-InSAR points within a 50 -m distance. We introduced an arbitrary offset to the first levelling measurement to fit the PS-InSAR estimates of the time series to compare the relative variations between both techniques. The levelling measurements of sites 1 to 4 and site 8 began in 2011, with a second measurement in October 2013. During this time lapse, all of the sites were affected by an uplift that decreased with the distance to the geothermal site. The uplift was 1.7, 1.6, 0.7 and 0.1  cm for sites 4, 3, 2 and 1, respectively. The difference between the levelling results at these site locations (2011 to 2013) and the InSAR results (April 2012 to September 2013) is less than 0.3  cm. Further, the main displacement before September 2013 arguably occurred during July to September 2013 and could be linked with the geothermal site. The first levelling measurements at the other sites began in October 2013.|$|E

40|$|The paper discusses, using {{geotechnical}} criteria, the potentialities {{offered by}} the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) technique to investigate a subsidence phenomenon affecting the urban area of Sarno town (Campania Region, Italy). To this aim, low- and full-resolution data, acquired by ERS- 1 / 2 and Envisat satellites in the period from 1992 to 2004, have been used. In particular, low-resolution DInSAR data, once validated via a comparison with <b>ground</b> <b>levelling</b> data, are analyzed in order to detect the most subsidence-affected areas where damages to buildings were recorded during past surveys. Interesting correlation between the ground deformation gradient vectors and some damage characteristics, such as the direction of building rotation axes, are shown. Then, a preliminary analysis at “building scale” by means of full-resolution DInSAR data is presented in order to study the response of some buildings to ground movements, also deriving the maximum values attained by some relevant parameters {{to be used in}} damage criteria. Finally, the usefulness of low- and full-resolution analyses for monitoring of urbanized areas is highlighted by stressing the role that the geotechnical approach can play in DInSAR data validation process as well as in pointing out all the issues to improve the reliability of the obtained results in at “building scale” studies...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{compacted}} subsurface {{soil layer}} {{can be a}} limiting factor for soybean growing, reducing soybean yield. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of different tillage systems on the physical properties of two Albaqualf soils of the Central Plains region in the state of Rio Grande do Sul in southern Brazil. Two experiments were conducted: one in Santa Maria, RS, during the 2013 / 14 and 2014 / 15 crop seasons, and another in Formigueiro, RS, during the 2013 / 14 crop season. A randomized block experimental design with four replications was used. The treatments were: sowing using an offset double disc (T 1); sowing using a fluted coulter disc (wavy disc with 12 waves) (T 2); sowing with a knife runner opener (T 3); sowing with a knife runner opener + press wheel mechanism for <b>ground</b> <b>levelling</b> (T 4); sowing using a furrow opener upon a raised bed (T 5); and chisel plough + sowing using an offset double-disc (T 6). In the 2014 / 15 growing season, the T 4 factor was changed using a knife runner opener 0. 05 m from the planting row. A smaller reduction in the compacted subsurface soil layer was observed for both T 1 and T 2, which exhibited high soil bulk density values for the 2013 / 14 and 2014 / 15 crop seasons. Furthermore, T 3, T 5 and T 6 led to a reduction in bulk density, and increasing total porosity and macroporosity in the soil, which consequently increased water infiltration, water storage capacity, and crop yield in areas with the presence of a compacted subsurface soil layer...|$|E
40|$|Flooding risk is a {{real problem}} in Vietnam leading the {{population}} to build dykes. When focusing on Hanoi and its surrounding, the flooding risk is even higher than {{in other parts of the}} country as most of areas in and around Hanoi are below the level of the river. In this framework, subsidence phenomenon which is the result of ground water pumping, is considered critical because of its close relationship with water supply issue. SAR Interferometry is an efficient alternative method to obtain information on topography and vertical ground movements, specially on urbanised zones where the backscatter characteristics of the targets produce a more reliable signal. The main shortcomings we had to cope with, were related to the availability of the optimal interferometric pairs in consideration of the smoothness of the relief. For DEM derivation, the compromise had to be realised between time interval separating the images, which has as consequence temporal decorrelation, and ambiguity height in relation with the small altitude variations. The access to additional <b>ground</b> <b>levelling</b> measurements was difficult. We had to extract the information from a SPOT orthoimage in order to obtain a corrected geocoding model issued from the interferogram (phases and orbits). This model was used both for DEM derivation and geocoding of subsidence related interferograms. Though we focused on areas strongly urbanised, the phase was still noisy for time intervals allowing the expected detection of movement (few centimetres per year). Neverthless, signatures of ground movements have been detected. In addition, the amplitude of the detected movements stays smaller than half wavelenght therefore the estimations have to be handled prudently as they are close to the precision limit of the method. The presented study highlights the performances and limits of the technique in the region and the interest of a long-term application to subsidence monitoring...|$|E

40|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>level</b> ozone is a {{secondary}} pollutant resulting from photochemical reaction {{of a variety}} of natural and anthropogenic precursor mainly volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx).

The overall objective of the study is to evaluate the <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> ozone time series concentrations for three years period (From 18 th June 2009 to 6 th June 2011) in Rwanda with focus on Kigali city as it has an increasing number of vehicles and many industries which are the major potential sources of <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> ozone sources in Kigali City.  We have gathered the data from the database air monitoring machine about the <b>ground</b> <b>level</b> ozone concentration located in Kigali at the college of science and technology of University of Rwanda laboratory and the weather information from Rwanda Meteorological Services were used to for the discussion of the ozone data.
