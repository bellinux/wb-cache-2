5|$|After many delays, the General and {{his party}} arrive in Honda, where the Governor, Posada Gutiérrez, has {{arranged}} for three days of fiestas. On his last night in Honda, the General returns late to camp and finds one of his old friends, Miranda Lyndsay, waiting for him. The General recalls that <b>fifteen</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> she had learned of a plot against his life and had saved him. The following morning, the General begins the voyage down the Magdalena River. Both his physical debilitation and pride are evident as he negotiates the slope to the dock: he {{is in need of}} a sedan chair but refuses to use it. The group stays a night in Puerto Real, where the General claims he sees a woman singing during the night. His aides-de-camp and the watchman conduct a search, but they fail to uncover any sign of a woman having been in the vicinity.|$|E

Any variable can be manipulated, including things that would not be possible in reality.|$|E
25|$|The {{screenplay}} of Halloween II {{was written}} by Carpenter and Hill. In a 1981 interview with Fangoria magazine, Hill mentions the finished film differs somewhat from initial drafts of the screenplay. The plot twist of Laurie being Michael's sister required a retcon of the timeline between Judith's murder and the events depicted in the first Halloween; while Michael Myers {{is said to have}} committed the crime <b>fifteen</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> and to be twenty-one.|$|E

25|$|According to the 2011 {{census of}} India, 78.9% of Bangalore's {{population}} is Hindu, {{a little less}} than the national average. Muslims comprise 13.9% of the population, roughly the same as their national average. Christians and Jains account for 5.6% and 1.0% of the population, respectively, double that of their national averages. The city has a literacy rate of 89%. Roughly 10% of Bangalore's population lives in slums.—a relatively low proportion when compared to other cities in the developing world such as Mumbai (50%) and Nairobi (60%). The 2008 National Crime Records Bureau statistics indicate that Bangalore accounts for 8.5% of the total crimes reported from 35 major cities in India which is an increase in the crime rate when compared to the number of crimes <b>fifteen</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E
500|$|Creator Tim Schafer {{has said}} that he has been a heavy metal music fan since high school, and roadies have long fascinated him. As Schafer said in 2007, [...] "The name was one of the very first things I thought of, over <b>fifteen</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> I was riding a bus, {{thinking}} about a game that would be the complete opposite of what we were working on, The Secret of Monkey Island [...] And Brütal Legend leapt into my head. I've been hanging on to that name ever since." [...] The title, which he describes as sounding [...] "like the hardest core fantasy thing out there", makes use of the metal umlaut. The idea behind the game first came to Schafer about fifteen years prior to its release, but its core concepts did not completely come together until after the completion of Psychonauts (2005), when he presented his idea for the game to the team, they became excited at the concept and decided to make that their next title.|$|E
500|$|The game's final {{scenario}} and {{the reason}} for Ghaleon's actions differ slightly from the original, with the Goddess Althena's instability serving as the catalyst for the events rather than a rampaging Black Dragon. In this version, Laike relates the story of how one day <b>fifteen</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> the Goddess Althena concluded that people were depending too much on her, rather than growing as people and as a civilization, and that by continuing to mother them, she was doing more harm than good. Despite Ghaleon's pleas, Dyne and Althena used their powers to spread her life force throughout the world, transforming her into an infant, to live out a mortal life as a human. Ghaleon, believing humanity could not survive without a god watching over them, cut off all ties to his former friend and set his plan into motion to ascend to godhood himself in Althena's place; his cause set on rule rather than revenge as in the original. Believing that humanity was strong and resourceful enough to live on their own, Dyne left the young girl in the care of Alex's parents to raise her as their own daughter before he began his new life as a traveling adventurer. Now knowing the truth of Luna's origins, Alex and his friends travel to the Goddess tower to save her and stop Ghaleon from seizing control of the world. Defeating his generals, Alex confronts Ghaleon at the tower's upper pagoda, where the ritual to transfer Luna's power to him has already begun. [...] Echoing Dyne's earlier declaration on the strength of humanity, Alex's team attacks and defeats Ghaleon as his fortress crumbles around them. [...] With Luna still caught in a trance, Alex attempts to reason with her to leave while the others are teleported to safety. Playing his ocarina, Alex awakens Luna's memories before the two are transported to the surface as the tower collapses, re-uniting with their companions.|$|E

2500|$|Temple Grandin {{is opposed}} to {{shackling}} and hoisting {{as a method of}} handling animals and [...] wrote, on visiting a shechita slaughterhouse, [...] "I will never forget having nightmares after visiting the now defunct Spencer Foods plant in Spencer, Iowa <b>fifteen</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Employees wearing football helmets attached a nose tong to the nose of a writhing beast suspended by a chain wrapped around one back leg. Each terrified animal was forced with an electric prod to run into a small stall which had a slick floor on a forty-five degree angle. This caused the animal to slip and fall so that workers could attach the chain to its rear leg [...] As I watched this nightmare, I thought, 'This should not be happening in a civilized society.' In my diary I wrote, 'If hell exists, I am in it.' I vowed that I would replace the plant from hell with a kinder and gentler system." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 a {{class action}} lawsuit was filed against Facebook alleging the company scanned user {{messages}} for web links, translating them to “likes” on the user’s Facebook profile. Data lifted from the private messages was then used for targeted advertising, the plaintiffs claimed. [...] "Facebook's practice of scanning the content of these messages violates the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA {{also referred to as}} the Wiretap Act), as well as California's Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), and section 17200 of California's Business and Professions Code," [...] the plaintiffs said. This shows that once information is online it is no longer completely private. [...] It is an increasing risk because younger people are having easier internet access than ever before, therefore they put themselves in a position where it is all too easy for them to upload information, but they may not have the caution to consider how difficult it can be to take that information down once it is out in the open. [...] This is becoming a bigger issue now that so much of society interacts online which was not the case <b>fifteen</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> [...] In addition, because of the quickly evolving digital media arena, people's interpretation of privacy is evolving as well, and {{it is important to consider}} that when interacting online. [...] New forms of social networking and digital media such as Instagram and Snapchat may call for new guidelines regarding privacy. [...] What makes this difficult is the wide range of opinions surrounding the topic, so it is left mainly up to our judgement to respect other people's online privacy in some circumstances. [...] Sometimes it may be necessary to take extra precautions in situations where somebody else may have a tighter view on privacy ethics. [...] No matter the situation it is beneficial to know about the potential consequences and issues that can come from careless activity on social networks.|$|E
