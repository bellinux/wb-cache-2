The government adopted a strategy of contesting every claim until a 1997 Supreme Court decision. After this, the Law Society of Ireland facilitated negotiations between the Chief State Solicitor's Office and the Department of Defence on the one hand, and the main solicitors' firms representing claimants on the other, {{which led to a}} suspension of court proceedings while a Department of Health expert group developed a standardised metric for assessing hearing loss. This group's 1998 [...] "Green Book" [...] report informed the Civil Liability (Assessment of <b>Hearing</b> <b>Injury)</b> Act, 1998. Subsequently, the Supreme Court advised the government to assign standardised rates of compensation for the various levels of hearing loss. It also awarded compensation based on predicted future loss of hearing additional to normal age-related hearing loss; opponents criticised this as impossible to quantify. In December 1999, the Supreme Court accepted the government's formula of IR£750 per degree of deafness attained at age 60. This was the basis for the Early Settlement Scheme used for most claims. The average claim payout fell from €30,000 before the adoption of the guidelines to €10,700 in 2002, €8,900 in 2003, and €5,700 in 2004.|$|E

The {{increase in the number}} of <b>hearing</b> loss <b>injuries</b> in the metal stamping industry initiated OSHA’s Special Emphasis Programs in designated industries and locations across the United States. Because occupational <b>hearing</b> loss <b>injuries</b> do not manifest themselves until years later, it is critical that employers install engineering controls immediately in order to protect worker’s hearing and prevent <b>hearing</b> loss <b>injuries.</b> Tumbling machines come in a variety of configurations. In addition to sound absorption material that can be installed on floors, ceilings, and walls, noise covers can also be custom-made and installed on tumbling machines. This study analyzed the effectiveness of custom-made tumbling noise covers in reducing the sound levels generated from the tumbling machines and reducing the operator’s noise exposures. Noise measurements and personal noise exposure were obtained prior to the installation of the noise cover and after the installation of the noise cover. The sound level and noise exposure results indicate that the noise cover is an effective control in reducing the sound levels produced by the tumbling machine and reducing noise exposures for the tumbling operators. Sound levels and operator’s noise exposures can be further reduced through the combination of machine configuration, hearing protection, use of absorption material to cover the walls, ceilings, and floors, enclosing the machines in a separate room, and the use of noise covers over the tumbling machines...|$|R

The {{aim of the}} project is to provide the {{capability}} to establish potential risks to cetaceans and seals {{from the use of}} acoustic deterrent devices in Scottish waters. Acoustic Deterrent Devices (ADDs) are often used on aquaculture sites to reduce predation of seals on fish stocks using acoustic emissions. These acoustic emissions may also have secondary effects on marine mammals (including non-target species) ranging from physical injury, behavioural response and reduced sensory capability. In this project, an attempt is made to investigate the effects of water depth, seabed sediment type and bathymetry on the propagation and received levels of ADDs.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate factors that affect the level of risk to hearing caused by common farming activities. Noise levels on farms were measured across a range of activities and producer groups, and situational factors that effect noise levels were also investigated. Older tractors were found to be 6 dB louder than newer tractors. Cabs reduced noise to the operator by 16 dB, which was halved to 8 dB if a door was open. Radios added between 3 and 5 dB to the noise in the cab. These variables significantly affect the noise level at the ear of operators and others in the workplace, and affect the subsequent exposure limits that are considered safe.

In order to quantify the distance at which AMDs designed as ‘seal scarers’ are detected by seals, the 50 % hearing thresholds for playbacks of their sounds were determined. The broadband hearing threshold sound pressure levels (SPLs) of two harbor seals for signals from two AMDs were similar (63 – 69 dB re 1 lPa, rms). Effects of the AMDs on the seals’ behavior were quantified at three SPLs: one which just did not cause behavioral changes, one which caused one of the seals to haul out occasionally, and one which caused one of the seals to haul out more than 10 % of the time. The corresponding mean received SPLs were, respectively, Ace Aquatec: 109, 124, and 134 dB re 1 lPa, rms; Lofitech: 128, 133, and 138 dB re 1 lPa, rms.

Although Nrf 2 -knockout mice maintained normalauditory thresholds at 3 months of age, their hearing ability was significantly more impaired than thatof age-matched wild-type mice at 6 and 11 months of age. Additionally, the numbers of hair cells andspiral ganglion cells were remarkably reduced in Nrf 2 -knockout mice at 11 months of age. To examinethe importance of Nrf 2 in protecting against gentamicin-induced ototoxicity, 3 -day-old mouse organof Corti explants were cultured with gentamicin.

To estimate the distance at which two AMDs designed as ‘seal scarers’ (Ace Aquatec and Lofitech) are detected by harbor porpoises, the 50 % hearing detection thresholds for playbacks of recordings of the AMD sounds were assessed. Both became audible at a received broadband sound pressure level (SPL) of 55 dB re 1 μPa. The effect of the AMDs on porpoise behavior was quantified at three SPLs determined during a pre-test: one which just did not cause a behavioral change, one which caused a small change in surfacing and swimming pattern, and one which caused the harbor porpoise to swim away from the transducers. The corresponding mean received SPLs in the pool were respectively: Ace Aquatec: 77, 117, and 139 dB re 1 μPa; and: Lofitech: 91, 121, and 151 dB re 1 μPa. As the mean received SPL increased, greater displacement occurred, and higher numbers of surfacings and increased swimming speed occurred in test periods than in associated baseline periods.

40|$|AbstractAn objective, fast, and {{reasonably}} accurate assessment test {{that allows for}} easy interpretation of {{the responses of the}} hearing thresholds at all frequencies of a conventional audiogram is needed to resolve the medicolegal aspects of an occupational <b>hearing</b> <b>injury.</b> This study evaluated the use of dichotic multiple-frequency auditory steady-state responses (Mf-ASSR) to predict the hearing thresholds in workers exposed to high levels of noise. The study sample included 34 workers with noise-induced hearing impairment. Thresholds of pure-tone audiometry (PTA) and Mf-ASSRs at four frequencies were assessed. The differences and correlations between the thresholds of Mf-ASSRs and PTA were determined. The results showed that, on average, Mf-ASSR curves corresponded well with the thresholds of the PTA contours averaged across subjects. The Mf-ASSRs were 20 ± 8 dB, 16 ± 9 dB, 12 ± 9 dB, and 11 ± 12 dB above the thresholds of the PTA for 500 Hz, 1, 000 Hz, 2, 000 Hz, and 4, 000 Hz, respectively. The thresholds of the PTA and the Mf-ASSRs were significantly correlated (r= 0. 77 – 0. 89). We found that the measurement of Mf-ASSRs is easy and potentially time saving, provides a response at all dichotic multiple frequencies of the conventional audiogram, reduces variability in the interpretation of the responses, and correlates well with the behavioral hearing thresholds in subjects with occupational noise-induced hearing impairment. Mf-ASSR can be a valuable aid in the adjustment of compensation cases...|$|E

The endolymphatic sac is located in a duplication of the dura of the posterior aspect of the petrous pyramid and is, therefore, in the surgical field of many neurosurgical operations performed on the posterolateral cranial base. The endolymphatic sac was exposed bilaterally in 10 anatomic specimens; the distance from the center of the sac to the posterior lip of the internal auditory meatus and to the XIth nerve in the jugular foramen was measured with a caliper. Also measured was the distance between the center of the sac and the closest point on the petrous ridge and the distance between that point and the petro-sigmoid intersection. The petro-sigmoid intersection was defined as the point at which the medial aspect of the sigmoid sinus intersects the lateral aspect of the petrous ridge. The dimensions of the sac were also recorded. On the average, the sac was found to be 15. 7 mm posterosuperior (superolateral) to the XIth nerve in the jugular foramen (range, 11. 0 – 18. 5 mm) and 13. 3 mm posterior (lateral) to the internal auditory meatus (range, 10. 0 – 18. 0 mm). The center of the sac was 24. 1 mm (mean value) (range, 20. 0 – 28. 0 mm) in front of the petro-sigmoid intersection at a point 11. 5 mm (mean value) (range, 8 – 17 mm) below the petrous ridge.

Such anthropogenic noise may affect marine animals by causing <b>hearing</b> <b>injuries</b> (Smith et al., 2004; Popper et al., 2007), masking of biological sounds (Richardson et al., 1995), or behavioural responses such as avoidance of the exposed habitat (e. g. Engås et al., 1996; Morton and Symons, 2002). In 2006, the Norwegian Navy began to operate a new class of frigates, equipped with high-power sonars transmitting at frequencies overlapping with the hearing range of several species of fish and marine mammals found in Norwegian waters (Enger, 1967; Richardson et al., 1995). As naval sonar operations often coincide with the geographic distribution of these species, an examination of potentially negative effects was needed. My PhD work includes three papers on the effect of such sonars have on herring (Clupea harengus), and one paper concerning the effect of sonars on the diving behaviour of three species of cetaceans; killer whales (Orcinus orca), pilot whales (Globicephala melas) and sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus). In paper 1, herring were exposed to sonar signals at 1 - 2 kHz (Low Frequency Active Sonar, LFAS) and 6 - 7 kHz (Mid frequency Active Sonar, MFAS), and playbacks of recorded sounds produced by killer whales while feeding, during herring overwintering in the Lofoten area. Herring behaviour was monitored by two upward-looking echosounders, located 400 m apart, as the sonar source approached and passed the fish. No significant horizontal or vertical avoidance reactions were detected in response to the sonar transmissions, however, the killer whale feeding sounds induced both vertical and horizontal movements. The results indicate that sonar transmissions at 1 - 2 kHz and 6 - 7 kHz have negligible influence on herring at the source levels tested (197 and 209 dB re 1 Pa, for LFAS and MFAS, respectively). The behavioural response during playback of killer-whale feeding sounds demonstrates the natural avoidance reaction, and the ability of the experimental design to reveal it. In paper 2, herring schools were exposed to LFAS and MFAS sonar signals as well as playbacks of recorded sounds of feeding killer whales during herring summer-feeding migration in the Norwegian Sea. Herring behaviour was monitored by a high-frequency fishery sonar (110 kHz) following the moving schools. The schools did not dive nor change their packing density in response to the LFAS and MFAS signals at estimated maximum received sound pressure levels of 176 and 157 dB (re 1 Pa m) and sound exposure levels of 181 and 162 dB (re 1 μPa² s) for LFAS and MFAS, respectively. In contrast, killer-whalefeeding sounds induced diving responses by the herring. Based on these results combined with those from papers 1 and 3, and additional information from the literature, thresholds of behavioural responses and injury were estimated, and a simple model was constructed to estimate the accumulated effects of sonar on the herring population. It is concluded that naval sonars are unlikely to cause any behavioural changes or physiological injuries which would affect the herring population. In paper 3, captive herring in a net pen were exposed to sonar signals at 1. 0 - 1. 6 kHz frequency, transmitted by a naval sonar source on a naval frigate. Experiments were conducted in all seasons. No behavioural reactions were detected, with maximum received sound pressure levels (SPL) of 168 dB re 1 μPa, at a distance of 500 m between the herring and the frigate. However, the fish did exhibit a significant diving reaction when exposed to noise from an outboard engine at a much lower SPL. This showed that captive herring exhibit avoidance responses similar to wild herring. Further, it demonstrated that the experimental setup allowed such responses to be detected when they occurred. In paper 4, diving behaviour of killer whales, pilot whales and sperm whales during exposure of MFAS and LFAS signals were studied during three field seasons of controlled exposure experiments. Diving behaviour were monitored before and during exposure by a digital tag attached on the animal, recording its vertical movement in addition to horizontal movement, vocalisation and received sound pressure level from the sonar. All three species tended to spend more time close to the surface during exposure, and less time diving. Changes in killer whale diving behaviour was strongly dependent on behavioural state, with whales in a feeding mode showing abrupt changes in diving behaviour, while no response were seen during travelling or socializing. Pilot whales showed only moderate responses at high exposure levels. Sperm whales conducted normal deep feeding dives during MFAS exposure, but reduced foraging activity during LFAS exposure...|$|R

'Having ridden, then, some leagues from the field, and noting this windmill, it did occur {{to me that a}} stout man might single-handed make it good against a troop of horse. We have no great love of flight, we Tetheridges. It may be mere empty pride, and yet the feeling runs strong in the family. We have a {{fighting}} strain in us ever since my kinsman followed Ireton's army as a sutler. I pulled up, therefore, and had dismounted to take my observations, when my brute of a charger gave the bridle a twitch, jerked itself free, and was off in an instant over hedges and ditches. I had, therefore, only my good sword left to trust to. I climbed up the ladder, and was engaged in planning how the defence could best be conducted, when I heard the clank of hoofs, and on the top of it you did ascend from below. I retired at once into ambush, from which I should assuredly have made a sudden outfall or sally, had the flour not so choked my breathing that I felt as though I had a two-pound loaf stuck in my gizzard. For myself, I am glad that it has so come about, for in my blind wrath I might unwittingly have done you an <b>injury.</b> <b>Hearing</b> the clank of your sword as you did come up the ladder, I did opine that you were one of King James's minions, the captain, perchance, of some troop in the fields below.' ...|$|R
