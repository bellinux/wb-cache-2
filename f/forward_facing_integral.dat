40|$|We {{consider}} a smooth <b>forward</b> <b>facing</b> step {{defined by the}} Gauss error function of height 4 - 30 % and four times {{the width of the}} local boundary layer thickness δ_ 99. The boundary layer flow over a smooth forward-facing stepped plate is studied with particular emphasis on stabilisation and destabilisation of the Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) waves and subsequently on transition. The interaction between TS waves at a range of frequencies and a base flow over a single/two <b>forward</b> <b>facing</b> smooth steps is conducted by linear analysis. The results indicate that for a high frequency TS wave, the amplitude of the TS wave is attenuated in the unstable regime of the neutral stability curve corresponding to a flat plate boundary layer. Furthermore, it is observed that two smooth <b>forward</b> <b>facing</b> steps lead to a more acute reduction of the amplitude of the TS wave. When the height of a step is increased to more than 20 % of the local boundary layer thickness for a fixed width parameter, the TS wave is amplified and thereby a destabilisation effect is introduced. Therefore, stabilisation or destabilisation effect of a smooth step is typically dependent on its shape parameters. To validate the results of the linear stability analysis, where a high-frequency TS wave is damped by the <b>forward</b> <b>facing</b> smooth steps direct numerical simulation (DNS) is performed. The results of the DNS correlate favorably with the linear analysis and show that for the investigated high frequency TS wave, the K-type transition process is altered whereas the onset of the H-type transition is postponed. The results of the DNS suggest that for a high-frequency perturbation F= 150 {{and in the absence of}} other external perturbations, two <b>forward</b> <b>facing</b> steps of height 5 % and 12 % of the boundary layer thickness delayed H-type transition scenario and completely suppresses it for the K-type transition.

40|$|We {{consider}} a smooth, spanwise-uniform <b>forward</b> <b>facing</b> step de ned by the Gauss error function of height 4 - 30 % {{and four times}} {{the width of the}} local boundary layer thickness δ_ 99. The boundary layer flow over a smooth forward-facing stepped plate is studied with particular emphasis on stabilisation and destabilisation of the two-dimensional Tollmien- Schlichting (TS) waves and subsequently on three-dimensional disturbances at transition. The interaction between TS waves at a range of frequencies and a base flow over a single or two <b>forward</b> <b>facing</b> smooth steps is conducted by linear analysis. The results indicate that for a TS wave with a frequency F 2 [140; 160] (F=! =U 21 106 where ! and U 1 denote the perturbation angle frequency and freestream velocity magnitude, respectively), the amplitude of the TS wave is attenuated in the unstable regime of the neutral stability curve corresponding to a at plate boundary layer. Furthermore, it is observed that two smooth <b>forward</b> <b>facing</b> steps lead to a more acute reduction of the amplitude of the TS wave. When the height of a step is increased to more than 20 % of the local boundary layer thickness for a xed width parameter, the TS wave is amplified and thereby a destabilisation e ect is introduced. Therefore, stabilisation or destabilisation effect of a smooth step is typically dependent on its shape parameters. To validate the results of the linear stability analysis, where a TS wave is damped by the <b>forward</b> <b>facing</b> smooth steps direct numerical simulation (DNS) is performed. The results of the DNS correlate favorably with the linear analysis and show that for the investigated frequency of the TS wave, the K-type transition process is altered whereas the onset of the H-type transition is delayed.

40|$|This {{intellectual}} property concerns an innovative new seating arrangement for passenger cars in which rearward facing passenger(s) sit beside and {{slightly to the}} rear of the centrally positioned <b>forward</b> <b>facing</b> driver. A <b>forward</b> <b>facing</b> passenger sits directly behind the driver between and slightly rearward of the two rear facing passengers (Figures 1 to 4). This arrangement overcomes the access/egress problems normally associated with all-forward-facing diamond seating configurations. The reverse diamond seating configuration allows conventional vehicle architecture and all rear passengers can alight from the conventional rear doors. When used for adults but particularly children, the rear facing seat squabs and head restraints retard the forward movement of occupants under rapid deceleration or collision. This reduces the concentrated loading and whiplash effect imparted by seatbelts on <b>forward</b> <b>facing</b> seats. The rearward facing seat cushions and squabs fold away in unit to allow the centre rear passenger to alight and to create luggage space alongside the centre rear passenger (Fig. 5). In addition the centre rear seat cushion can be raised to create a large transverse luggage space. The rear seat can also be folded to the floor or removed entirely to further increase the luggage space (Fig. 6). The ‘reverse diamond’ seating arrangement permits a wide range of seating and cargo configurations and also reduces frontal projected area of the vehicle which is beneficial to the reduction of aerodynamic drag...|$|R
