Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable liferaft. Agent Flynn and Flight Attendant Claire regain control of the plane. Rick retakes the controls and has Flynn go into the cargo hold to restore the air conditioning/ventilation system. Agent Flynn contacts FBI Special Agent Hank Harris on the ground, who gets in touch with ophiologist <b>Dr.</b> <b>Steven</b> Price, Customs' main source for animal smuggling cases.

The dealer finally reveals that Kim hired him to obtain the snakes and adds how the latter managed to smuggle them on board the plane.
