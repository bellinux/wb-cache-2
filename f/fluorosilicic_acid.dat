500|$|Fluorine is {{the thirteenth}} most common element in Earth's crust at 600–700ppm (parts per million) by mass.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the influence that an advanced demineralisation procedure has on the combustion characteristics of coal. A high-volatile bituminous coal with 6. 2 % ash content was treated in a mixture of hydrofluoric and <b>fluorosilicic</b> <b>acids</b> (HF/H 2 SiF 6). Nitric acid was used either as a pre-treatment, or as a washing stage after HF/H 2 SiF 6 demineralisation, with an ash content as low as 0. 3 % being attained in the latter case. The structural changes produced by the chemical treatment were evaluated by comparison of the FTIR spectra of the raw and treated coal samples. The devolatilisation and combustibility behaviour of the samples was studied by using a thermobalance coupled to a mass spectrometer (TGA-MS) for evolved gas analysis. The combustibility characteristics of the cleaned samples were clearly improved, there being a decrease in SO 2 emissions...|$|R
40|$|The {{reactivity}} of the SiF+ 3 cation towards oxygen bases (H 2 O, CH 3 OH, and CH 3 CH 2 OH) and nitrogen bases (NH 3 and CH 3 NH 2) {{has been studied}} using Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. The SiF+ 3 ion exclusively attacks the n-centre of the selected bases, yielding excited onium intermediates that undergo fragmentation by elimination of either an alkyl cation (CH 3 OH, CH 3 CH 2 OH, and CH 3 NH 2) or an HF molecule (H 2 O, NH 3, and CH 3 NH 2). In H 2 O, various protonated <b>fluorosilicic</b> and silicic <b>acids</b> are formed which can be readily converted into their esters and amides by reaction with alcohols and ammonia, respectively. The structure and the {{reactivity of}} several such species have been investigated by mass-analyzed ion kinetic energy-collision induced dissociation spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. The extreme affinity of SiF+ 3 toward n-type electrons ranks it as a powerful gaseous “Lewis superacid”, suitable for generating long-lived, highly reactive ions, e. g.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} feldspar contamination of different extent (by fluoro-silicic acid etching for different time periods and mixing pure quartz with different percentage of un-etched grains) on blue-light stimulated luminescence (BLSL) of quartz (38 - 63 µm) for Chinese loess. In particular, the De values and the shape of growth curves will be examined. The results show that: (1) The De determined using feldspar in Chinese loess is obviously underestimated, and infra-red stimulated luminescence (IRSL) has a greater underestimation than BLSL. For aliquots with no <b>fluorosilicic</b> <b>acid</b> etching, an IRSL De underestimation of ~ 30 % is observed for a sample with an ex-pected age of ~ 22 ka, ~ 19 % underestimation for BLSL, and ~ 10 % for post-IR BLSL. For quartz BLSL, the contamination of feldspar, which has not dissolved by <b>fluorosilicic</b> <b>acid</b> etching, will inevi-tably lead to age underestimation. We suggest that the IR-checking should be performed for every single aliquot. An aliquot should be excluded from the final De calculation if obvious IRSL signal was observed. (2) For the sample under examination blue LED stimulation can reset both IRSL and BLSL signals of feldspars, while IR stimulation cannot reset the BLSL of feldspars. (3) For multiple-mineral aliquot the growth curve shape of the post-IR BLSL {{is different from that}} of the IRSL, and within 25 Gy it is identical to that of the pure quartz BLSL.

Photolithography and <b>fluorosilicic</b> <b>acid</b> etching were used to fabricate microfluidic channels (referred to as FISHing lines) that allowed analysis of 10 samples on a glass microscope slide 0. 2 µl of sample volume was used to fill a micro-channel, which resembled a 250 -fold reduction compared to conventional FISH. FISH signals were comparable to conventional FISH, with 50 -fold less probe consumption and 10 -fold less time. Cells were immobilized in single file in channels just exceeding the diameter of the cells, and were used for minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis. To test the micro-channels for application in FISH, MRD was simulated by mixing K 562 cells (an established chronic myeloid leukemia cell line) carrying the BCR/ABL fusion gene across 1 : 1 to 1 : 1, 000 Jurkat cells (an established acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line). The limit of detection was seen to be 1 : 100 cells and 1 : 1, 000 cells for FISHing lines and conventional FISH, respectively; however, the conventional method seemed to over-score the presence of K 562 cells. This may in part be attributed to FISHing lines practically eliminating the chance of duplicate screening of cells and hastened the time of screening, enhancing scoring of all cells within the channels.

40|$|The {{security}} and safety of the drinking water distribution system has recently generated concern. Accidental and intentional contamination by chemical, biological and radiological contaminants could cause major consequences for the consumer because clean water {{is critical to the}} nation's infrastructure. An attack on the water supply could disable an entire city. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a system to monitor the water quality to ensure the water is safe for consumption. In an attempt to protect the water systems, Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) initiated research to test the various instruments within a Contaminant Warning System (CWS). The system measures water quality and triggers an alarm for deviation in the quality. The different methods of detection utilized in the study include turbidity, chlorine, pH, conductivity, TOC, Online gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, ultra violet transmittance, biomonitor, and a pathogen identification system. The contaminants were pumped into the pilot distribution system CWS, and the responses of a variety of online monitors were evaluated.

30|$|In contrast, CFA {{was treated}} {{pelletized}} with lime and calcinated, leaching with sulfuric acid that yielded better recovery. US Patent No. 4254088 (1981) discusses a process where the CFA was sintered {{with a mixture}} of NaCl and Na 2 CO 3 at a temperature 700 – 900  °C. After sintering, 90  % of the aluminum CFA was in the acid soluble fraction. Recently, Matjie et al. (2005) discussed this calcinated technique at high temperature to decompose mullite phases, and then the calcinated CFA was leached in sulfuric acid to produce a solution containing Fe, Al and Ti species. The selective recovery of Al and Ti was carried out using various extraction methods, solvent extraction was more efficient than others and recovered 99.4  % of Al 2 O 3 and 97  % of TiO 2. US Patent No. 4539187 (1985) also used an acid treatment where CFA was reacted with concentrated <b>fluorosilicic</b> <b>acid</b> and hydrogen fluoride at high temperature to form aqueous silicon fluoride vapor and fluoride and fluorosilicate of Al and Fe. Separated the Al and Fe bearing fluorides and fluorosilicate from aqueous silicon vapor, hydrolyzed and then recovered the substantial amount of pure Fe and Al following electroplating process. Recently, Wu et al. (2012) demonstrated pressure acid-leaching method, wherein the high extraction (82.4  %) of Al was obtained by diminishing CFA size (74  μm) and increasing acid concentrations (50  %). However in this method, the non-target metals readily leached into the acid, resulting in impurities. In addition, acid leaching had limited application due to its highly corrosive nature, besides this process required high cost, acid resistant equipment, and air-tight processing to protect the work environment.|$|E
30|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{developed}} for the recovery of silica such as acid or alkali leaching, followed by separation and purification using different techniques. US Patent No. 4539187 (1985) describes a method where CFA is reacted with <b>fluorosilicic</b> <b>acid</b> and hydrogen fluoride at a high temperature to form fluorides of Fe, Al and Si. The fluoride mixture is distilled, separating the aqueous and gaseous silicon fluoride from the mixtures, hydrolyzing the silicon fluorides vapor, and recovering silicon dioxide in high purity form. Recently, US Patent No. 0287827 A 1 (2010) released a method where a mixture of coal and CFA is reacted with hydrogen fluoride in water to produce a liquid stream containing silicon fluoride and metal fluorides, and a solid stream containing unreacted coal and S compounds. Sulfur compounds are reacted with metallic nitrates dissolved in the water, which separated the aqueous solution of nitrate, S and metallic ions from the solid coal, and the solid coal is then washed with water. Subsequently, silicon fluoride and metal fluorides are contacted with metallic nitrates in an aqueous mixture to form solid silicon dioxide, and solid silicon dioxide is separated from the aqueous mixture. This process has recovered high purity silica from CFA. However, acid leaching is not always appropriate because it needs better acid resistant and air-tight processing equipment and it causes environmental pollution. This problem can be solved by using alkaline leaching methods. US Patent Nos. 0119426 A 1 (2010) and 7871583 B 2 (2011) released an alkaline leaching method for the recovery of silica from CFA, where Si is leached using NaOH in the form of Na 2 SiO 3 solution. The solution is vaporized to obtain Na 2 SiO 3, and pure silica (> 98.5  %) is produced by carbonation.|$|E
40|$|Purpose Life cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) {{of chemicals}} is usually developed using a process-based approach. In this paper, we develop a tiered hybrid LCA of water treatment chemicals combining {{the specificity of}} process data with the holistic nature of input–output analysis (IOA). We compare these results with process and input–output models for {{the most commonly used}} chemicals in the Australian water industry to identify the direct and indirect environmental impacts associated with the manufacturing of these materials. Methods We have improved a previous Australian hybrid LCA model by updating the environmental indicators and expanding the number of included industry sectors of the economy. We also present an alternative way to estimate the expenditure vectors to the service sectors of the economy when financial data are not available. Process-based, input–output and hybrid results were calculated for caustic soda, sodium hypochlorite, ferric chloride, aluminium sulphate, <b>fluorosilicic</b> <b>acid,</b> calcium oxide and chlorine gas. The functional unit is the same for each chemical: the production of 1 tonne in the year 2008. Results and discussion We have provided results for seven impact categories: global warming potential; primary energy; water use; marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecotoxicity potentials and human toxicity potential. Results are compared with previous IOA and hybrid studies. A sensitivity analysis of the results to assumed wholesale prices is included. We also present insights regarding how hybrid modelling helps to overcome the limitations of using IO- or process-based modelling individually. Conclusions and recommendations The advantages of using hybrid modelling have been demonstrated for water treatment chemicals by expanding the boundaries of process-based modelling and also by reducing the sensitivity of IOA to fluctuations in prices of raw materials used for the production of these industrial commodities. The development of robust hybrid life cycle inventory databases is paramount if hybrid modelling is to become a standard practice in attributional LCA...|$|E
40|$|Fluoride in {{drinking}} water may be present from natural sources or added as sodium fluoride (NaF), sodium silicofluoride (Na 2 SiF 6) or <b>fluorosilicic</b> <b>acid</b> (H 2 SiF 6). Results from an early study with rats suggested that, when ingested as Na 2 SiF 6, the absorption and excretion of fluoride were greater than when ingested as NaF. Objective: The present single-blind, crossover study with 10 adults was done to determine three key pharmacokinetic parameters: the maximum plasma fluoride concentrations (C-max), the elapsed time to reach the maximum concentrations (T-max) and the 6 -h areas under the time-plasma concentration curves (AUCs) after ingestion of 500 ml, of water containing 0. 67 or 5. 45 mg F/L present naturally or added as NaF or H 2 SiF 6. Design: Blood was collected prior to and at nine time points during 6 h after ingestion of the test solutions. Plasma was analysed by electrode after HMDS-facilitated diffusion and the data were analysed for statistically significant differences using repeated measures ANOVA. Results: The C-max, T-max and AUC values after ingestion of the solutions containing natural fluoride, NaF or H 2 SiF 6 {{did not differ significantly}} at either dose level. Further, the Tmax values associated with the 0. 67 and SAS mg/L solutions did not differ significantly indicating that the absorption, distribution and elimination rates were not affected by the dose size. Conclusions: Considered together with published reports, the present findings support the conclusion that the major features of fluoride metabolism are not affected differently by the chemical compounds commonly used to fluoridate water nor are they affected by whether the fluoride is present naturally or added artificially.
