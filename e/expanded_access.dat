Growth in agriculture can benefit the rural poor, though it does not always do so.

Crop diversity can protect againstcrop failure, and can also offer higher returns.|$|E

Wade. Romney attributed his conversion to an interaction with Harvard University biologist Douglas Melton, an expert on embryonic stem cell biology, although Melton vehemently disputed Romney's recollection of their conversation. Romney subsequently vetoed a bill on pro-life grounds that <b>expanded</b> <b>access</b> to emergency contraception in hospitals and pharmacies (the legislature overrode the veto).

25|$|Interest in {{renewable}} energies {{has increased in}} recent years due to environmental concern about global warming and air pollution, reduced costs of the technologies themselves, and improved efficiency and reliability.

25|$|HTML5 also expands {{access to}} user media, {{potentially}} granting {{access to a}} computer's microphone or webcam, a capability previously only possible {{through the use of}} plug-ins like Flash. It is also possible to find a user's geographical location using the geolocation API. With this <b>expanded</b> <b>access</b> comes increased potential for abuse as well as more vectors for attackers. If a malicious site was able to gain access to a user's media, it could potentially use recordings to uncover sensitive information thought to be unexposed. However, the World Wide Web Consortium, responsible for many web standards, feels that the increased capabilities of the web platform outweigh potential privacy concerns. They state that by documenting new capabilities in an open standardization process, rather than through closed source plug-ins made by companies, it is easier to spot flaws in specifications and cultivate expert advice.|$|E

2500|$|Although Obregón was {{a gifted}} {{military}} strategist during the Revolution and decisively defeated Pancho Villa's Division of the North at the Battle of Celaya {{and went on}} to become President of Mexico, his posthumous name recognition and standing as a hero of the Revolution is nowhere near that of Villa's or Emiliano Zapata's.
