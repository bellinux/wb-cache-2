40|$|Pompeii, {{since its}} first {{excavation}} in 1738, has been constantly explored and excavated, leaving a huge site of 66 hectares to require maintenance and restorative work. The {{sheer volume of}} this work necessitates a comprehensive and cohesive conservation approach {{as well as a}} meticulous management system. Past conservation methods have been haphazard and in some cases damaging to the site. Increasingly, it has become apparent that the problems in Pompeii are largely organizational rather than technical or financial. No method for sustainable restoration of the site has been kept in place by the site’s management. In 2010, the House of the Gladiators collapsed due to rainwater damage, <b>drawing</b> <b>press</b> attention. In 2011, Pompeii returned to the spotlight when the ancient city’s outer wall began to deteriorate as well. Most recently, two yards of a wall on the Vicolo di Modesto, an area excavated in the late nineteenth century, collapsed in November 2011. The constant media attention on failed conservation efforts has prompted efforts towards reorganization and prevention of future problems. 1 To forward these goals, the Grande Progetto Pompei 2 promises to evaluate the site and treat emergency work within five years, hoping to complete its first phases by 2015. This new organization for Pompeii offers hope for the preservation of decoration, but only if crucial steps are taken and funding is spen...|$|E

Although with a classic force control algorithm, consisting of a non-linear feedforward loop and a closed loop PID control, the results are normally quite good, {{there are times when}} tuning up is difficult and performance diminishes significantly at high rates. A new force control has therefore been developed applying sliding mode techniques, which is more robust than the previous control, especially in problem cases. Copyright © 2005 IFA...|$|R

40|$|During forming, {{the deep}} <b>drawing</b> <b>press</b> and tools undergo large loads, {{and even though}} they are {{extremely}} sturdy structures, deformations occur. This causes changes in the geometry of the tool surface and the gap width between the tools. The deep drawing process can be very sensitive to these deformations. Tool and press deformations can be split into two categories. The deflection of the press bed-plate or slide and global deformation in the deep drawing tools are referred to as macro press deformation. Micro-deformation occurs directly at the surfaces of the forming tools and is one or two orders lower in magnitude. The goal is to include tool deformation in a FE forming simulation. This is not principally problematic, however, the FE meshes become very large, causing an extremely large increase in numerical effort. In this paper, various methods are discussed to include tool elasticity phenomena with acceptable cost. For macro deformation, modal methods or ’deformable rigid bodies’ provide interesting possibilities. Static condensation is also a well known method {{to reduce the number of}} DOFs, however the increasing bandwidth of the stiffness matrix limits this method severely, and decreased calculation times are not expected. At the moment, modeling Micro-deformation remains unfeasible. Theoretically, it can be taken into account, but the results may not be reliable due to the limited size of the tool meshes and due to approximations in the contact algorithms...|$|E
40|$|In the "Merge" {{project a}} forming {{process for the}} in situ {{manufacture}} of metal/plastic composite structures will be developed. The process {{is a combination of}} deep drawing, injection moulding and media based forming in one die. The project is splited into two phases. In the first phase 2013 - 2014 the technical basis will be created and tested on a cup with a polymer injected plastic inner part. Aluminum, steel and hybrid laminates will be used as sheet materials and PA 6 as plastic component. In the second phase 2015 - 2017 the process should be transferred to a production orientated part. After {{the state of the art}} three technologies for the manufacturing of metal plastic composite parts are existing: the insert technology, the outsert technology and the metal plastic hybrid technology. In all technologies the metal or sheet parts where produced separately from the plastic parts. The injection moulding process is only used for forming the plastic parts and for joining the parts. The "Merge" process is divided into two steps. First operation is the deep drawing process to generate the preform of the metal part. Then the injection moulding process takes place. The plastic melt will be used for the injection moulding and also as an active media for metal forming. A real deep drawing process with blank holder and die cushion should be realized. So the process had to be installed on a deep <b>drawing</b> <b>press</b> together with an injection moulding bolt on unit...|$|E
40|$|Stamping dies {{are used}} in the Sheet Metal Forming (SMF) process for {{manufacturing}} of car body parts. The lead time for design and manufacturing of a stamping die is long, and therefore costly. In the final step of the manufacturing process, manual rework is performed to reach a desired pressure distribution on the forming surfaces in order to achieve a robust process and an approved part within tolerance. The main purpose for this work is to study and further develop a Virtual Rework Method that alters the shape of the forming surfaces of a die to compensate for the displacements of a stamping press that occur during stamping. Measurements were performed to obtain the displacements that occur in the stamping press during stamping. These measurements were performed on a double action deep <b>drawing</b> <b>press</b> of the brand Danly, located at Volvo Cars Tool & Die department in Olofström, Sweden. The measurement yields information of how the stamping press is deflecting and deforming during operation. The measurements are recorded with a Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system that records the displacements of the press during stamping. The displacements obtained in the measurements are then used as constraints to inverse FE- model a press table with topology optimization. This optimized press table is used in the Virtual Rework Method to be able to simulate both the deformations of the press and the internal deformations that occur in the die. Pre-simulations were performed before the measurements to ensure that the blank holder plate used in the measurements would withstand the applied blank holder force. These simulations also yield if the displacements were large enough for the ARAMIS DIC system to capture. The FE-model used in this work consisted of a die, blank holder, blank holder plate, outer ram and the optimized press table. The Virtual Rework Method was applied on the FE-model, where the result concludes that the altered shape of the deformed forming surfaces is almost identical to the shape of the nominal forming surfaces. However, an inversed modelled structure that represents the behavior of the outer ram is required to apply the Virtual Rework Method on the blank holder. This inversed modelled structure could be created from the displacements obtained in the measurements. To apply the Virtual Rework method on the punch, further measurements are required, where the position of the ARAMIS DIC system is altered, or an additional ARAMIS DIC system is used.  Pressverktyg används i plåtformningsprocessen vid tillverkning av karossdelar.
