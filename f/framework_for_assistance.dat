The norms in question are characterised with a lack of elasticity; or they do treat the elderly {{in the same way as}} fully valid participants in the conduct of civil law transactions (with the same duties and without any adequate protection because of the ageing) or the norms give some legal protection to the elderly however at the cost of their legal incapacitation. One of the main aims of the reform of the care of mature persons which was introduced in Austria, Sweden and Germany was a creation of legal <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> <b>assistance</b> to the elderly with no intervention in their private sphere. The article gives an attempt to determine the position of the care of the elderly within Polish law system, it presents also the present legal state and propositions of changing certain legislative dispositions. Synthetic and sometimes quite general formulation of Polish provisions made it possible for the courts to get an interpretation which diminishes possible intervention in the rights of persons under care. However, in many cases the help offered for the elderly occurs to be insufficient, so a change of respective law provisions is already desirable. Renouncing of the institution of legal incapacitation in its present form shall not only deprive the care of its undesirable effects but, in the same time, shall make it possible to assist the elderly in a way better adapted to concrete needs...|$|E

40|$|Background: In 2008, the US {{government}} {{mandated that}} HIV/AIDS care and treatment programs {{funded by the}} US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) should shift from US-based international partners (IPs) to registered locally owned organizations (local partners, or LPs).

The ClASS framework involves all stakeholders {{in the identification of}} LPs’ strengths and needs <b>for</b> technical <b>assistance.</b> Objective: This article examines the role of ClASS in building capacity of LPs that can endure and adapt to changing financial and policy environments. Design: All stakeholders (n= 68) in Kenya, Zambia, and Nigeria who had participated in the ClASS from LPs and IPs, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and, in Nigeria, HIV/AIDS treatment facilities (TFs) were interviewed individually or in groups (n= 42) using an open-ended interview guide. Thematic analysis revealed stakeholder perspectives on ClASS-initiated changes and their sustainability. Results: Local organizations were motivated to make changes in internal operations with the ClASS approach, PEPFAR's competitive funding climate, organizational goals, and desired patient health outcomes. Local organizations drew on internal resources and, if needed, technical assistance from IPs. Reportedly, ClASS-initiated changes and remedial action plans made LPs more competitive for PEPFAR funding. LPs also attributed their successful funding applications to their preexisting systems and reputation. Bureaucracy, complex and competing tasks, and staff attrition impeded progress toward the desired changes. Although CDC continues to provide technical assistance through IPs, declining PEPFAR funds threaten the consolidation of gains, smooth program transition, and continuity of treatment services. Conclusions: The well-timed adaptation and implementation of ClASS successfully engaged stakeholders who committed their own resources toward strengthening organizational capacity. The sustainability of built capacity depends on continued investment in leadership, staff retention, and quality improvement...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the state of}} the ENP policy in the framework of the present institutional impasse of the EU. Even if the Lisbon Treaty enters in force, an acceptable functioning of a EU with 27 members can hardly be compatible with the permanence of the unanimity vote for the most important decisions, such as budgetary issues or enlargement. Further enlargement under these circumstances can be seen both as difficult and ill advisable: the more, and more heterogeneous, the members, the higher the probability that the requirement of unanimity may lead to disruptive strategic behaviour. Thus enlargement of the market, and legal approximation, can best take place, realistically speaking, in the framework of ENP. At the same time the assistance to recognized prospective members, who probably {{will not be able to}} enter in the foreseeable future, could well perform a role not too different from that of ENP, amounting substantially to a kind of ENP in disguise. In both cases we have the use of the typical instruments for the preparation of enlargement, but with some different stated objectives, and a different <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> financial <b>assistance.</b> So long as enlargement seems concretely possible the prospect of membership may continue to have additional incentive effects. The momentum for reform may however be lost if eventually the process is seen as to be never-ending. Some greater approximation to membership status can be provided by an extended ENP policy, but it seems highly unlikely that the internal dynamics of the EU will allow even the most compliant of the neighbours to enjoy the same economic advantages of actual membership, as the paradigm of “everything but institutions” would imply...|$|R
40|$|Many {{satellite}} anomalies {{manifest themselves}} slowly {{over time and}} go undetected until they reach critical and possibly unrecoverable status. Because modern satellite systems are relatively reliable, the ground controller must perform the almost impossible task of attending carefully {{over long periods of}} time to telemetry readouts which almost always indicate nominal operation, while maintaining a constant readiness for the onset of failure. Humans are notoriously poor at that type of task. On the other hand, intelligent systems have been successfully used to monitor emerging trends in data streams and have been used successfully for tireless monitoring of manufacturing processes, changes in structure configurations, and deterministic failure patterns. The problem then becomes to develop an "intelligent" real-time system for fault detection, diagnosis, and recovery/resolution of anomalies in satellite telemetry streams. This Model Based Reasoning Diagnostic Engine (MBRDE) is aimed at the combination of adaptive and knowledge-based intelligent methodologies that provides a satellite diagnostic assistant for incorporation into future satellite ground stations. We present a <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> a diagnostic methodology that combines characteristics of model-based reasoning with those of anytime algorithms. We illustrate a bottom-up modeling method that constructs a hierarchical device model, and a top-down traversal method that constructs a tree of potential component diagnoses for a given anomaly in the device’s observed outputs. These methods combine to form an innovative <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> providing diagnostic <b>assistance</b> based on model-based principles given any amount of processing time...|$|R
