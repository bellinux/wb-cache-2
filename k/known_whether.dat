5|$|Many of the regnal {{dates of}} the East Anglian kings are {{considered}} unreliable, often being based upon computations.

5|$|According to Suetonius, the Domus Aurea had a dome that perpetually rotated on {{its base}} in {{imitation}} of the sky. It was reported in 2009 that newly discovered foundations of a round room may be those of a rotating domed dining hall. Also reported in contemporary sources is a ceiling over a dining hall in the palace fitted with pipes so that perfume could rain from the ceiling, {{although it is not}} <b>known</b> <b>whether</b> this was a feature of the same dome. The expensive and lavish decoration of the palace caused such scandal that it was abandoned soon after Nero's death and public buildings such as the Baths of Titus and the Colosseum were built at the site.|$|E

The {{question of whether or not}} Caligula was insane (especially after his illness early in his reign) remains unanswered.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} suggests that Mesolithic people settled {{in the region of}} York between 8000 and 7000BC, although it is not <b>known</b> <b>whether</b> their settlements were permanent or temporary. By the time of the Roman conquest of Britain, the area was occupied by a tribe known to the Romans as the Brigantes. The Brigantian tribal area initially became a Roman client state, but, later its leaders became more hostile and the Roman Ninth Legion was sent north of the Humber into Brigantian territory.|$|E

By 1938, the couple had drifted apart, as both focused heavily on their work, although Goddard was again his leading lady in his next feature film, The Great Dictator. She eventually divorced Chaplin in Mexico in 1942, citing incompatibility and separation for more than a year.|$|E
5|$|In Pakistan, the {{breeding}} {{range of the}} dusky crag martin overlaps that of the subspecies P. f. peloplasta of pale crag martin, but that species breeds much higher in the mountains. This altitudinal separation means {{that it is not}} <b>known</b> <b>whether</b> the two closely related martins could hybridise, which would cast doubts as to whether they were distinct species. Dusky crag martins from Burma and Thailand have been described as a separate darker subspecies, P. c. sintaungensis (originally Krimnochelidon concolor sintaungensis, Baker, 1832), {{but it is not clear}} that the difference is greater than that between individual martins of the nominate subspecies.|$|E

5|$|In {{areas of}} Pakistan where its range {{overlaps}} {{with that of}} the dusky crag martin, the pale crag martin breeds at a higher altitude. Its range does not overlap there with the Eurasian crag martin, which is found high in the Himalayas, but where both occur in Iran, the pale crag martin favours more arid habitats. In North Africa, the Eurasian species is again found at a higher level. The separation by altitude and aridity means that it is not <b>known</b> <b>whether</b> the closely related Ptyonoprogne martins could hybridise. If they were shown to do so, it would cast doubts on their specific distinctness.|$|E
5|$|In sum number place (Samunampure), {{the regions}} are of {{irregular}} shape and various sizes. The usual constraints of no repeated value in any row, column or region apply. The clues are given as sums of values within regions (e.g. a 4-cell region with sum 10 must consist of values 1,2,3,4 in some order). The {{minimum number of}} clues for Samunampure is not known, nor even conjectured. A variant on Miyuki Misawa's web site replaces sums with relations: the clues are symbols =, < and > showing the relative values of (some but not all) adjacent region sums. She demonstrates an example with only eight relations. It is not <b>known</b> <b>whether</b> {{this is the best}} possible.|$|E

The manner of Eorpwald's conversion indicated that he was a subordinate king and that Edwin was his overlord.|$|E
