5|$|The Continental Army had {{previously}} suffered several defeats in New York and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> retreat through New Jersey to Pennsylvania.

5|$|The {{predictions}} made by Diem and Ely {{were extremely}} inaccurate. There had been heavy fighting in northern Vietnam, where the Vietminh {{were at their}} strongest, and many people <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> abandon their homes. Although French charities had been operating in the north, the refugee camps were disorganised {{and were able to}} provide little more than shelter. As a result, there was a great number of northerners who wanted to leave and start a new life in the south.|$|E
5|$|At the time, it made Orr {{the highest-paid}} player in league history. But beyond that, the signing {{became one of}} the most {{important}} in the history of professional hockey. Until that time, players <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> accept whatever NHL management paid in salaries. It was the start of the player's agent era in professional hockey. For Eagleson, it was the start of his sports business empire. Based on the Orr signing, Eagleson would become the executive director of the new National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) and started on his rise to become one of the most powerful men in the sport and business of ice hockey.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{had played}} several matches already, which was unusual as the Super Cup would {{normally}} {{have been the}} first significant match the two teams had played. Liverpool <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> enter the first qualifying round of the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League, despite being champions. They had failed to finish in the top four during the 2004–05 FA Premier League, which would ensure Champions League qualification. UEFA granted them special dispensation to enter the competition as holders. Meanwhile, CSKA Moscow {{were in the middle of}} their domestic season. At the time of this match they were second in the 2005 Russian Premier League, seven points behind leaders Lokomotiv Moscow.|$|E

5|$|By mid-November, the Germans {{had nearly}} taken Stalingrad in bitter street {{fighting}} when the Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad and {{an assault on}} the Rzhev salient near Moscow, though the latter failed disastrously. By early February 1943, the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> surrender, and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the Germans launched another attack on Kharkov, creating a salient in their front line around the Russian city of Kursk.|$|E
5|$|Carney was {{appointed}} U.S. Ambassador to Sudan on 27 June 1995 {{during a period}} of turmoil in U.S.-Sudan relations. Osama bin Laden had fled Saudi Arabia for the safe confines of Khartoum a few years earlier, and Sudan's alleged harboring and abetting of Muslim extremists on its soil was attracting attention of counterterrorism experts in the United States and abroad. Carney's tenure as ambassador followed a tumultuous period during which his predecessor, Donald K. Petterson, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> draw down embassy staff by half and send their families back to America when terrorist threats were made against U.S. diplomats stationed in Khartoum.|$|E
5|$|Duke Frederick II of Austria, {{who arrived}} to assist Béla against the invaders, {{defeated}} a small Mongol troop near Pest. He seized prisoners, including Cumans from the Eurasian Steppes who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> join the Mongols. When {{the citizens of}} Pest realized the presence of Cumans in the invading army, mass hysteria emerged. The townsfolk accused Köten and their Cumans of cooperating with the enemy. A riot broke out and the mob massacred Köten's retinue. Köten was either slaughtered or committed suicide. On hearing about Köten's fate, his Cumans decided to leave Hungary and destroyed many villages on their way towards the Balkan Peninsula.|$|E

5|$|Eleven Ottoman {{infantry}} divisions <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> retire, suffering 28,443 casualties; some 12,000 {{prisoners were}} captured, 100 guns, {{and scores of}} machine guns were also captured. Now the Ottoman Army needed to deploy troops from other theatres {{to make up for}} these significant losses. On 15 December the Ottoman 2nd Caucasian Cavalry Division arrived in Palestine and became the reserve of the XXII Corps before taking part in the counterattacks of 27 December. The 1st Infantry Division arrived from the Caucasus and moved to Nablus in reserve. A significant consequence of the Ottoman Empire's firm focus on the Levant was that the British recapture of Baghdad and the British offensive in Mesopotamia became more viable and secure.|$|E
5|$|However, Alexios's {{problems}} were only just beginning. At {{a time when}} the Emperor urgently needed to raise as much revenue as possible from his shattered empire, taxation and the economy were in complete disarray. Inflation was spiralling out of control, the coinage was heavily debased, the fiscal system was confused (there were six different nomismata in circulation), and the imperial treasury was empty. In desperation, Alexios <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> finance his campaign against the Normans by using the wealth of the Eastern Orthodox Church, which had been put at his disposal by the Patriarch of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|In August 1916, a {{combined}} Ottoman and German Empire army <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> retreat to Bir el Abd, after the British {{victory in the}} Battle of Romani. During the following three months the defeated force retired further eastwards to El Arish, while the captured territory stretching from the Suez Canal was consolidated and garrisoned by the EEF. Patrols and reconnaissances were carried out by British forces, to protect the continuing construction of the railway and water pipeline and to deny passage across the Sinai desert to the Ottoman forces by destroying water cisterns and wells.|$|E

In November 2009 RNC announced that it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> send a third of its students home following an outbreak of swine flu on campus. During the heavy winter snowfall of 2009–2010 the college's sports facilities were utilised by the Hereford United team for training after the bad weather conditions made using their own grounds at Edgar Street difficult.|$|E
5|$|In the Treaty of Roskilde {{two years}} earlier, Denmark-Norway <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> cede the Danish provinces of Scania, Halland, Blekinge, {{the island of}} Bornholm and the Norwegian provinces Trøndelag and Båhuslen. The Treaty of Copenhagen reaffirmed the Swedish rule over Scania, Halland, Blekinge, and Bohuslän, while Bornholm and Trøndelag were returned. It was a {{significant}} victory for Denmark-Norway, {{but it did not}} result in a reversal of the costly earlier peace. The treaty of 1660 established political borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway which have lasted to the present.|$|E
5|$|On 17 July 1917, George appeased British {{nationalist}} feelings {{by issuing}} a royal proclamation {{that changed the}} name of the British royal house from the German-sounding House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the House of Windsor. He and all his British relatives relinquished their German titles and styles, and adopted British-sounding surnames. George compensated his male relatives by creating them British peers. His cousin, Prince Louis of Battenberg, who earlier in the war <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> resign as First Sea Lord through anti-German feeling, became Louis Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven, while Queen Mary's brothers became Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge, and Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone.|$|E
