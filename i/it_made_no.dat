5|$|In {{the final}} analysis, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> difference; Fletcher's {{carriers}} had launched their planes beginning at 07:00 (with Enterprise and Hornet having completed launching by 07:55, but Yorktown not until 09:08), so the aircraft that would deliver the crushing blow {{were already on}} their way. Even if Nagumo had not strictly followed carrier doctrine, {{he could not have}} prevented the launch of the American attack.|$|E
5|$|On January 3, 2008, IGN {{reported}} that Valve employees {{had created a}} thread on Valve's website forums for players to list the problems they had encountered and to suggest fixes, which caused speculation that a patch was being planned to address the issues in the PlayStation 3 version, such as the frame rate issues, the connection problems in Team Fortress 2, and the slow loading times in Portal. A patch for the PlayStation 3 version was later released in North America on March 19, 2008 and in Europe a short while after that; however, <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> mention of fixing frame rate issues or slow loading times.|$|E
5|$|In late September, the Italian fleet, {{including}} Fiume, made a sweep for a British troop convoy from Alexandria to Malta, but <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> {{contact with}} the British ships. Fiume was present in the harbor at Taranto when the British fleet launched the nighttime carrier strike on Taranto {{on the night of}} 1112 November, but she was not attacked in the raid. Another attempt to intercept a British convoy in late November resulted in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. The Italian fleet left port on 26 November and clashed with the British fleet the next day, in an engagement that lasted for about an hour. Campioni broke off the action because he mistakenly believed he was facing a superior force, the result of poor aerial reconnaissance. The British heavy cruiser HMS Berwick was hit twice by 203mm rounds during the engagement, either fired by Fiume or her sister Pola.|$|E

5|$|Piso {{was rumored}} to have been {{responsible}} for his death and with accusations coming in it wasn't long before the well known accuser, Lucius Fulcinius Trio, brought charges against him. The Pisones were longtime supporters of the Claudians, and had allied themselves with Octavian early on. The continued support of the Pisones and his own friendship to Piso made him hesitant to hear the case himself. After briefly hearing both sides, Tiberius deferred the case to the Senate, making no effort to hide his deep anger toward Piso. Tiberius made allowances for Piso to summon witnesses of all social orders, including slaves, and he was given more time to plea than the prosecutors, but <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> difference: before the trial was over Piso died ostensibly by suicide, but Tacitus supposes Tiberius may have had him murdered before he could implicate the emperor in Germanicus' death.|$|E

25|$|Charles Leland was an American folklorist and occultist who {{travelled}} around Europe in {{the latter}} 19th century and was a supporter of Michelet's theories. In 1899 he published Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches, which he claimed had been a sacred text for Italian witches. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> mention of a horned god, but did mention a male deity known as Lucifer, {{as well as a}} female deity, the goddess Diana.

However, the historian Pei Songzhi pointed out that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> sense for Jiang Wei to set up the ambush because he did not know that Wei reinforcements would show up when he was besieging Didao so the ambush would not have served its purpose.|$|E

25|$|Yet {{it proved}} {{that there were}} limits to the Burmese {{military}} power. The Burmese learned {{that they could not}} fight two simultaneous wars, especially if one of them was against the world's largest military. Hsinbyushin's reckless decision to fight a two-front war nearly cost the kingdom its independence. Moreover, their losses, while smaller than Qing losses, were heavy in proportion to her much smaller size of population, hampering their military capability elsewhere. Konbaung's military power would plateau in the following decades. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> progress against Siam. Its later conquests came only against smaller kingdoms to the west—Arakan, Manipur and Assam.|$|E
25|$|After {{the defeat}} of France the High Command (OKW) felt they had won the war, and some more {{pressure}} would persuade Britain. On 30 June the OKW Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl issued his paper setting out options: the first was to increase attacks on shipping, economic targets and the RAF: air attacks and food shortages were expected to break morale and lead to capitulation. Destruction of the RAF was the first priority, and invasion would be a last resort. Hermann Göring's operational directive issued the same day ordered destruction of the RAF {{to clear the way}} for attacks cutting off seaborne supplies to Britain. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> mention of invasion.|$|E
25|$|Although The Rosary {{cemetery}} in Norwich {{had begun to}} pioneer elements of a non-denominational approach, it had presented only a partial model (<b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>no</b> progress on designing a non-denominational chapel until the late nineteenth century). Similarly, other cemeteries to date had only been able to apply the term non-denominational in a partial sense, lacking non-denominational entrance lodges or chapels. Consequently, at the date of Hosking's brief, there was no European architectural style for the buildings of a wholly non-denominational cemetery on which he could draw for inspiration. Thus Hosking's brief was both novel and ambitious. There was no similar model to base his designs on, other than what was in a partially state of progress in the New World, at Mount Auburn Cemetery near Boston.|$|E
