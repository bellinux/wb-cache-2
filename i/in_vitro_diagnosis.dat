40|$|SUMMARY Jejunal biopsies from {{controls}} and coeliac patients were maintained in organ culture {{for up to}} 48 hours. The in vitro effect of gluten fraction III {{during the period of}} culture was assessed by measurement of the activity of the brush border enzymes alkaline phosphatase and a-glucosidase. Mucosa from {{controls and}} treated and untreated coeliacs behaved similarly and no reproducible in vitro effect of gluten was demonstrated. These results cast doubt on the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of coeliac disease by monitoring brush border enzyme activity. During the past 10 years there has been considerable interest in in vitro organ culture of human small intestinal mucosa, especially in relation to coeliac disease. '- 5 In 1978 Katz and Falchuk 6 found the technique so reliable that they postulated its use as a predictive test for the definitive diagnosis of gluten sensitivity. Their basis for discrimination between normal and coeliac mucosa in the organ culture system was the degree of change found in mucosal alkaline phosphatase activity during culture in {{the presence or absence of}} a peptic-tryptic digest of gluten. However, there is disagreement in the literature as to the reliability of these changes during organ culture 5 and, consequently, doubt about the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of gluten sensitivity.
