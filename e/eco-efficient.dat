50|$|Thus, {{a service}} is {{environmentally}} favorable when {{the total amount}} of environmental impact prevented as compared to an alternative is larger than the amount of environmental impact generated by the service. Related concepts include eco services, <b>eco-efficient</b> services, product-service systems, sustainable service systems and sustainable product service-systems. An <b>eco-efficient</b> service (EES) is a certain product-service mix which has a higher added value (economics) and a smaller environmental impact compared to a similar product-service mix or {{a situation in which the}} activity was not performed at all“. Added value applies for consumers as wells as producers. It is usually defined in terms of higher profit margins, improved image or the ability to comply with governmental rules for producers. Added value to consumers consists of the perceived extent to which consumer needs are satisfied. Examples are, lower costs, increased flexibility, shifted responsibility or increased convenience.|$|E

50|$|Policy {{formulations}} {{for businesses}} include the goals, strategies and principles implemented to achieve rational outcomes. A policy barrier to sustainable services is that goals and strategies {{need to be}} formulated {{in such a way}} that an <b>eco-efficient</b> combination of products and services is a possible outcome. A possible solution to this barrier is the need for companies to view their service issues from a higher level of abstraction and ask themselves what kind of functionality or added value they want to deliver to their customers. Companies also need to formulate an environmental goal they wish to achieve. First the current situation of the company needs to be analysed on the basis of environmental impact. Afterwards, new goals for providing sustainable services can be formulated. This can be done with the help of tools such as current eco-design tools, Life Cycle Assessment scenarios, and the adapted MET-matrix.|$|E

50|$|Material input {{per unit}} of service (MIPS) is an {{economic}} concept, originally developed at the Wuppertal Institute, Germany in the 1990s. The MIPS concept {{can be used to}} measure eco-efficiency of a product or service and applied in all scales from a single product to complex systems. The calculation takes into account materials required to produce a product or service. The total material input (MI) is divided by the number of service units (S). For example, in case of a passenger car, the number of service units is the total number of passenger kilometres during the whole life span of the vehicle. The lower the material input per kilometre, the more <b>eco-efficient</b> is the vehicle. The whole life-cycle of a product or service is measured when MIPS values are calculated. This allows comparisons of resource consumption of different solutions to produce the same service. When a single product is examined, the MIPS calculations reveal the magnitude of resource use along the life-cycle and help to focus efforts on the most significant phases to reduce environmental burden of the product.|$|E
50|$|There are {{approximately}} 4.7 million {{businesses in the}} UK of which 99.7% are SMEs. The large size of the sector lends itself {{to the idea that}} environmental impacts are cumulatively large. Whilst there has been limited research into the quantitative impacts of SMEs, the Marshall Report estimates that 60% of total carbon emissions in the UK are attributable to SMEs. SMEs are also responsible for around 60% of commercial waste and 43% of all serious industrial pollution incidents. The perception of SME environmental behaviour is generally poor. Failure to pursue <b>eco-efficient</b> measures has often been attributed to low levels of awareness and lack of resources. It is theorised that as the majority of SMEs serve local markets {{they are less likely to}} be exposed to international pressures or incentives, including those likely to promote eco-innovation. It has also been suggested that civil society has less concern for smaller firms’ actions, being more likely to direct their concern towards larger organisations which are seen to have the biggest impact.|$|E
5000|$|The eco-costs {{of global}} warming (also called eco-costs of carbon footprint) {{can be used as}} an {{indicator}} for the carbon footprint. The eco-costs of resource depletion can be regarded as an indicator for 'circularity' in the theory of the circular economy. However, it is advised to include human toxicity and eco-toxicity, and include the eco-costs {{of global warming}} in the calculations on the circular economy as well. The eco-costs of global warming are required to reveal the difference between fossil-based products and bio-based products, since biogenic CO2 is not counted in LCA (biogenic CO2 is part of the natural recycle loop in the biosphere).Therefore, total eco-costs can be regarded as a robust indicator for cradle-to-cradle calculations in LCA for products and services in the theory of the circular economy.Since the economic viability of a business model is also an important aspect of the circular economy, the added value of a product-service system {{should be part of the}} analysis. This requires the two dimensional approach of <b>Eco-efficient</b> Value Creation [...] as described at the Wikipedia page on the model of the Ecocosts/Value Ratio, EVR.|$|E
40|$|As one {{prominent}} form of sustainable innovation, <b>eco-efficient</b> services have been promoted as a promising way towards more sustainable societies, {{but they have}} not turned into reality as expected.

The reductions should be achieved through technical and organisational means: the technical optimisation of the production process, the development of environmental compatible products and through utility-oriented design. The technical improvements should be entirely supported by the introduction and dissemination of new <b>eco-efficient</b> service concepts (sharing, leasing or renting of products, repair-services, re-marketing etc.). <b>Eco-efficient</b> services are offered to firms {{as well as to}} private users.

40|$|Growing {{concerns}} regarding {{the environmental impact}} of industrial activities, coupled with consumer demands for environmentally sound products, have forced manufacturers to scrutinize carefully the environmental friendliness and economical prosperity of their products during the design process; a domain called <b>eco-efficient</b> product design. To design an <b>eco-efficient</b> product, related requirements must be considered during the conceptual design phase, where the cost of incorporating changes is relatively low, and different feasible concepts of the product should be evaluated as such.

40|$|Copyright @ 2010 Greenleaf PublishingEco-efficient Product-Service System (PSS) {{innovations}} {{represent a}} promising approach to sustainability. However {{the application of}} this concept is still very limited because <b>eco-efficient</b> PSS are intrinsically radical innovations, that challenge existing customers’ habits (cultural barriers), companies’ organizations (corporate barriers) and regulative framework (regulative barriers). Because of these multi-dimensional changes, <b>eco-efficient</b> PSS can be considered complex and highly uncertain innovations, and therefore difficult to be predicted, planned and managed.

40|$|Concrete {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{construction}} materials in the world. However, the production of Portland cement as the essential constituent of concrete requires a considerable energy level and also releases a significant amount of chemical carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere. Thus, seeking an <b>eco-efficient</b> and sustainable concrete may be one of the main roles that construction industry should play in sustainable construction. To make the concrete more <b>eco-efficient,</b> different life cycle phases of concrete products should be considered, such as extraction of raw material, production of constituents, production of concrete, transportation, erection, maintenance, deconstruction or demolition and recycling.

40|$|Problem statement: In recent years, much {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} the eco-efficiency&# 13; of product development. The majority of environmental decisions are only made in the later stages of&# 13; product development where not much modification can be done. To produce <b>eco-efficient</b> products,&# 13; environmental decisions ought to be considered {{in the early stages of}} product development. With the&# 13; demand of developing more <b>eco-efficient</b> products, designers are found to be lacking the appropriate&# 13; design tools and guidelines. Approach: Products were designed to solve problems. Therefore, we&# 13; suggest the usage of the 40 principles of TRIZ to generate <b>eco-efficient</b> product designs. The 40 &# 13; principles of TRIZ is one of the fundamental tools of TRIZ. We studied the design features of different&# 13; water filters, washing machines and power drills to correlate the elements of eco-efficiency and the&# 13; principles of TRIZ. Results: From the case studies, it was shown that there is a correlation between&# 13; <b>eco-efficient</b> elements and TRIZ principles in existing products. The information obtained from the&# 13; product case studies alongside with the study of the individual TRIZ principles resulted in the&# 13; formation of a new tool. This new tool was called the TRIZEE Design Tool. After that, literature&# 13; review on the commonly practiced design methodologies were carried out. A new methodology termed&# 13; TRIZEE Design Methodology was developed. New tools and existing tools were incorporated within&# 13; this methodology. Conclusion: We proved that there is a correlation between <b>eco-efficient</b> elements&# 13; and the 40 principles of TRIZ.
