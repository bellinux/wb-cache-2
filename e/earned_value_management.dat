40|$|<b>Earn</b> <b>Value</b> <b>Management</b> is a {{commonly}} used performance measuring and reporting mechanism. There are {{different types of}} construction projects exist. Some projects are rather similar, while others are completely different in characteristics. Hence the same EVM technique will not give the best results for every project and that EVM is not even appropriate for certain projects.

40|$|<b>Earn</b> <b>Value</b> <b>Management</b> is a {{globally}} {{accepted and}} well established integrated planning and control methodology that combines {{the measurement of}} cost, schedule and technical performance. It enables early detection of performance issues and allows corrective actions to be implemented in a timely manner. The objective {{of this study is}} to establish the possibility of introducing <b>Earn</b> <b>Value</b> <b>Management</b> as an ICTAD Condition of Contract for Major Contracts for the performance reporting and evaluation. In literature review derived the several important benefits of the EVM as an effective performance measuring technique, the problems in implementing and commonly used practice standards in the globe. The construction industry was an early private industry adopter of EVM. EVM is commonly used in United States of America, United Kingdom, Australia and other European and Asian countries to evaluate construction projects. EVM is a flexible and universally applicable project management technique. However, in Sri Lankan construction industry there is a need of a globally established performance monitoring technique for the development of the industry and better performance. Under these circumstances, it is important to find out the feasibility of introducing EVM as an ICTAD condition for the construction industry. The effectiveness of the ICTAD document to the industry is high. The level of acceptance is significant; the responses show that 64 % of respondents accept the Time Schedule as an effective tool and 37. 3 % submit it on-time for all projects to fulfil the ICTAD requirement. However, Sri Lankan construction industry doesn’t have a proper understanding and knowledge about the use of Time Schedule and its limitations. The lack of knowledge about the technique hinders the getting appropriate use of the technique. However, respondents believe effective performance measuring technique should not have these limitations. The result of this study confirms the possibility of introducing the EVM in Sri Lankan construction industry for performance reporting and evaluation. Further, results highlight that the importance and necessity of <b>Earn</b> <b>Value</b> <b>Management</b> to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of Sri Lankan construction industry. The majority of respondents believe the most important aspect of the EVM is, it helps projects to be completed within time and cost constraints compared to other benefits. The survey results illustrate that more than 80 % of respondents believe Sri Lankan construction industry need EVM concept for effective and accurate performance management. The cost performance management is the primary concern of the Industry. The Industry’s perception on the possibility of EVM implementation is satisfactory...|$|R

Some project managers feel that the <b>earned</b> <b>value</b> <b>management</b> technique is misleading, because it does not distinguish progress on the project constraint (i.e., on the critical chain) from progress on non-constraints (i.e., on other paths).

The {{foundation}} of <b>Earned</b> <b>Value</b> Performance <b>Management</b> (EVPM) was the cost/Schedule Control Systems Criteria originally {{defined in the}} USA in 1967. <b>Earned</b> <b>Value</b> Performance <b>Management</b> has traditionally been used in Defense projects with budgets in excess of R 100 M.

Bundling of requirements to reduce contracting actions in particular reduce contracting workload but necessarily create increased risks and other undesirable impacts to include reduction of potential vendors who directly accomplish the work in question (thereby increasing subcontracting and decreasing specific experience with particular categories of work by prime contractors). Overbundling also reduces competition by reducing the number of vendors willing to take responsibility as a prime integrator over areas that are not in their core business. At some point, bundling reduces vendor base to so called prime integrators who do little to none of the work in house.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Earn</b> <b>Value</b> <b>Management</b> Pilot {{provided}} {{a tremendous amount}} of data on {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the new financial system, the ability to support EVM from many viewpoints, the lack of tools for small to medium projects implementing EVM, and the training and environment necessary to successfully deploy EVM to all projects. This data along with other pilots will prove invaluable. Deploying EVM should not be taken lightly - a full assessment of capabilities and supporting infrastructure should be done prior to any deployment, and some very basic questions should be asked. For instance, will sufficient training be provided? Can the project managers readily and easily obtain all the necessary data? If EVM is to thrive in all projects regardless of cost, the transition should be as seamless as possible, minimizing cost and effort, and with the end user in mind. In setting up an EVM implementation, the question, "How does the project manager benefit from this process?" must remain at the forefront. Further research in this area is needed to answer the question,"Is EVM cost effective in small projects?" The authors welcome knowledge sharing with other organizations that are striving to gain the benefits of EVM on small projects...|$|R

5000|$|It {{is helpful}} to see an example of project {{tracking}} {{that does not include}} <b>earned</b> <b>value</b> performance <b>management.</b> Consider a project that has been planned in detail, including a time-phased spend plan for all elements of work. Figure 1 shows the cumulative budget (cost) for this project as a function of time (the blue line, labeled PV). It also shows the cumulative actual cost of the project (red line, labeled AC) through week 8. To those unfamiliar with EVM, it might appear that this project was over budget through week 4 and then under budget from week 6 through week 8. However, what is missing from this chart is any understanding of how much work has been accomplished during the project. If the project was actually completed at week 8, then the project would actually be well under budget and well ahead of schedule. If, on the other hand, the project is only 10% complete at week 8, the project is significantly over budget and behind schedule. A method is needed to measure technical performance objectively and quantitatively, and that is what EVM accomplishes.|$|R
