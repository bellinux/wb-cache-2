5|$|The concert {{took place}} on Saturday, September 19, 1981, on the Great Lawn, the central open space of Central Park. The first spectators, many {{carrying}} chairs or picnic blankets, arrived at daybreak to secure a <b>good</b> <b>spot.</b> The Parks Department originally expected about 300,000 attendees. Although rain fell throughout the day and continued until {{the start of the}} concert, an estimated 500,000 audience members made this the seventh-largest concert attendance in the United States in history.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt and Hull {{accepted}} the invitation, {{since they were}} keen to delay Japan's potential attack. Roosevelt told Ambassador Nomura {{that he would like}} to see more details of Konoe's proposal, and he suggested that Juneau, Alaska, might be a <b>good</b> <b>spot</b> for a meeting.|$|E
25|$|The area {{south of}} Ladoga is heavily forested with many {{wetlands}} (notably peat deposits) {{close to the}} lake. This terrain hindered the mobility of artillery and vehicles. In addition the forest shielded both sides from visual observation. One of the key locations were the Sinyavino heights, which were approximately 150metres higher than the surrounding flat terrain. The heights {{were one of the}} few dry and clear areas and provided a <b>good</b> <b>spot</b> for observation. The front line changed very little after the blockade was established, allowing the German forces to build a dense defensive network of strong points in the area, interconnected by trenches, protected by extensive obstacles and interlocking artillery and mortar fire.|$|E

25|$|The runway is {{presently}} being shared between {{the airport and}} the Edwin Andrews Air Base (EAAB). Military jets and aircraft land and depart on this runway. At the end of Runway 09 is the street to Barangay Sta. Maria, and a park. This can be a perfect spot to take pictures for departing and landing aircraft. At {{the end of the}} Runway 27 is San Roque St., which hosts a large public cemetery. It is also a <b>good</b> <b>spot</b> for plane spotting. Each end of the runway has aprons capable of supporting two Boeing 737s. One of the aprons in the end of Runway 9 is being used by the Philippine Air Force. OV-10s, C-130s, and other Air Force and military aircraft are parked there. While the apron at the end of Runway 27 is available, but need repairs.|$|E
25|$|French reconnaissances had {{confirmed}} Saxe in {{his belief}} that the allies would endeavour to relieve Tournai by attempting to force a passage from the south-east via the hamlet of Fontenoy and {{the small town of}} Antoing on the Scheldt. The French commander now cast about for a <b>good</b> <b>spot</b> where he might await the attack in security, finally settling on a potentially strong defensive position on {{the eastern side of the}} Scheldt, about 5 miles (~9km) south-east of Tournai. To guard against any break-out by the Dutch from within the besieged city the Marquis of Dreux-Brézé was left with 21,550 men in the trenches, and orders to contain the garrison of about 8,000 men at all costs. Louis XV took to the field in person, accompanied by his son Louis, and their enormous retinue. After observing the siege at Tournai, the King moved on to the Château de Calonne between Tournai and Antoing. That same day, 8 May, Saxe began to move his main troops into position to face the Pragmatic Army.|$|E
500|$|Season 14 {{received}} generally positive reviews. High-Def Digest {{was positive}} recommending {{the set and}} writing [...] "The show has numerous moments that make you laugh."

Blu-ray.com also gave season 14 3.5/5 stars who thought [...] "After rewatching all of {{it for the first}} time since this batch of episodes originally aired, I have to say—season fourteen has a pretty good laugh-per- minute ratio." [...] Casey Broadwater also felt it was an improvement over the Scully seasons and season 13. Collider gave the season a B-. The reviewer thought [...] "As far as the overall quality of the season, it isn't as consistently good as some earlier seasons but in the evolution of the show and the characters, it's solid.". Jackson Cresswell thought [...] "C.E.D'oh" [...] was the best of the season along with [...] "Pray Anything" [...] and [...] "Brake My Wife, Please" [...] while citing [...] "Three Gays of the Condo", [...] "Large Marge", and [...] "Helter Shelter" [...] as the worst. Ryan Keefer of DVD Talk gave it a 4/5 calling it [...] "a <b>good</b> <b>spot</b> to start brushing up on things,".|$|E

[...] "It keeps you occupied and always in the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Binsey is a hill on the {{northern}} edge of the Lake District in Cumbria, England. It is detached {{from the rest of the}} Lakeland hills, and thus provides a <b>good</b> <b>spot</b> to look out at the Northern and North Western Fells of the Lake District, as well as the coastal plain and, across the Solway Firth, Scotland. [...] Snaefell on The Isle of Man is also visible on a clear day. It is {{the northern}}most of the Wainwrights.|$|E
2500|$|Tumalo State Park is a <b>good</b> <b>spot</b> for birdwatching. [...] Swallows {{are common}} around the cliffs, and great blue herons {{can be seen}} along the river shoreline.

2500|$|Sun–Earth [...] is a <b>good</b> <b>spot</b> for space-based observatories. Because {{an object}} around [...] will {{maintain}} the same relative position {{with respect to}} the Sun and Earth, shielding and calibration are much simpler. It is, however, slightly beyond the reach of Earth's umbra, so solar radiation is not completely blocked at L2. (Real spacecraft generally orbit around L2, avoiding partial eclipses of the Sun to maintain a constant temperature). From locations near L2, the Sun, Earth and Moon are relatively close together in the sky; this means that a large sunshade with the telescope on the dark-side can allow the telescope to cool passively to around 50 K – this is especially helpful for infrared astronomy and observations of the cosmic microwave background. The James Webb Space Telescope is due to be positioned at L2.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the mid-19th}} century, Les Grandes Fourches was a {{stopping}} off {{point for the}} Red River ox carts which carried goods on the Red River Trails between St. Paul, Minnesota and Fort Garry (now Winnipeg, Manitoba). On June 15, 1870, the first post office was opened and [...] "Les Grandes Fourches" [...] was anglicanized to [...] "Grand Forks". Unlike most cities in North Dakota, the city of Grand Forks does not owe its existence {{to the arrival of}} the railroad. Instead, Grand Forks was first an important steamboat port on the Red River of the North. In late 1870, a steamboat captained by Alexander Griggs froze in the Red River at Grand Forks and Griggs and his men were forced to remain there {{for the rest of the}} winter. They built a temporary shed to live in for the winter and Griggs seemed to have decided that the area would be a <b>good</b> <b>spot</b> for a town. In the spring, he claimed a nine-acre (36,000 m²) piece of property that would become the townsite and, ultimately, downtown Grand Forks.|$|E
2500|$|In 1923, Miller {{entered the}} University of Colorado in Boulder, where he joined Sigma Nu Fraternity, but {{spent most of}} his time away from school, {{attending}} auditions and playing any gigs he could get, including with Boyd Senter's band in Denver. He dropped out of school after failing three out of five classes one semester, and decided to concentrate on making a career as a professional musician. He later studied the Schillinger technique with Joseph Schillinger, under whose tutelage he composed what became his signature theme, [...] "Moonlight Serenade". In 1926, Miller toured with several groups, eventually landing a <b>good</b> <b>spot</b> in Ben Pollack's group in Los Angeles. He also played for Victor Young, allowing him to be mentored by other professional musicians. In the beginning, he was the main trombone soloist of the band. But when Jack Teagarden joined Pollack's band in 1928, Miller found that his solos were cut drastically. From then, he realized that, rather than being a trombonist, his future lay in arranging or writing music. He also had a songbook published in Chicago in 1928 entitled Glenn Miller's 125 Jazz Breaks for Trombone by the Melrose Brothers copyrighted in 1927. During his stint with Pollack, Miller wrote several musical arrangements of his own. He also co-wrote his first composition, [...] "Room 1411", written with Benny Goodman and released as a Brunswick 78, 4013, credited to Bennie Goodman's Boys. In 1928, when the band arrived in New York City, he sent for and married his college sweetheart, Helen Burger. He was a member of Red Nichols's orchestra in 1930, and because of Nichols, Miller played in the pit bands of two Broadway shows, Strike Up the Band and Girl Crazy (where his bandmates included future big band leaders Benny Goodman and Gene Krupa).|$|E
