40|$|AbstractRefinement of Petri nets is {{well suited}} for the {{hierarchical}} design of system models. It is used to represent a model {{at different levels of}} abstraction. Usually, refinement is a static concept. For many scenarios, however, it is desirable to have a more flexible form of refinement. For example in the context of service updates, e. g. version control in distributed systems, a mechanism for dynamic transition refinement is needed. The requirement of <b>dynamic</b> <b>refinement</b> at runtime is quite strong. Since we would like to redefine the system structure by itself, transition refinement cannot be implemented by a model transformation. Instead, an approach is needed which allows for dynamic net structures that can evolve as an effect of transitions firing. In previous work we introduced nets-within-nets as a formalism for the <b>dynamic</b> <b>refinement</b> of tokens. Here we consider an extension of nets-within-nets that uses special net tokens describing the refinement structure of transitions. Using this formalism it is possible to update refinements, introduce alternative refinements, etc. We present some formal properties of the extended formalism and introduce an example implementation for the tool Renew in the context of workflow modeling...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to improve the spray and combustion modeling of internal combustion engines using <b>dynamic</b> mesh <b>refinement.</b> The first part of the study used advanced spray models with a <b>dynamic</b> mesh <b>refinement</b> scheme to simulate atomization of gasoline and diesel sprays. Traditionally gasoline sprays and diesel sprays were simulated using different models due to their different characteristics. This study was able to use the same set of models without adjustments in model constants and obtain good agreement between experimental and simulation results. The model was also used to simulate a direct-injection gasoline engine with realistic geometry. The present spray model with <b>dynamic</b> mesh <b>refinement</b> algorithm was shown to predict the spray structure and liquid penetration accurately with reasonable computational cost. In the second part of this study, diesel combustion modeling was performed using the above advanced spray model. The Shell ignition model, which uses a simplified reaction mechanism, was used to simulate the autoignition process of hydrocarbon fuels. The laminar-and-turbulent characteristic-time combustion model along with the Shell model was used to simulate the overall low and high temperature chemistry. The simulation results were compared with the experimental data with good agreement. The combination of combustion and spray models along with the <b>dynamic</b> mesh <b>refinement</b> was also validated using experimental data obtained from a heavy-duty diesel engine. In conclusion, a model, which is a combination of advanced spray model and combustion model with <b>dynamic</b> mesh <b>refinement,</b> was developed to simulate spray combustion in internal combustion engines...|$|R

Obtaining coherent network activity without sacrificing node autonomy and network flexibility places severe demands on the local control component of each node.

The position of the daughter particles and their smoothing distance are determined such that the error introduced due to the refinement is kept small. Further, possible numerical instabilities are identified and avoided by using adequate refinement parameters.

40|$|Abstract—Stream {{surfaces}} and streamlines are two popular methods for visualizing three-dimensional flow fields. While several parallel streamline computation algorithms exist, rela-tively {{little research has}} been done to parallelize stream surface generation. This is because load-balanced parallel stream surface computation is nontrivial, due to the strong dependency in computing the positions of the particles forming the stream surface front. In this paper, we present a new algorithm that computes stream surfaces efficiently. In our algorithm, seeding curves are divided into segments, which are then assigned to the processes. Each process is responsible for integrating the segments assigned to it. To ensure a balanced computational workload, work stealing and <b>dynamic</b> <b>refinement</b> of seeding curve segments are employed to improve the overall performance.

40|$|International audienceParameter {{estimation}} in {{non linear}} mixed effects models requires {{a large number}} of evaluations of the model to study. For ordinary differential equations, the overall computation time remains reasonable. However when the model itself is more complex (for instance when it is a set of partial differential equations) it may be time consuming to evaluate it for a single set of parameters. The procedures of population parametrization (for instance using SAEM algorithms) are then very long and in some cases impossible to do within a reasonable time.

However, only poor geometric accuracy can be obtained using the rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) parameters provided, making ground control points (GCPs) necessary for emergency response.

This is mainly due to the facts that (1) manual GCP selection is time-consuming and cumbersome because of too many human interventions, especially {{for the first few}} GCPs; (2) typically, GF- 4 gives planar array imagery acquired at rather large tilt angles, and the distortion introduces problems in image matching; (3) reference data will not always be available, especially under emergency circumstances.
