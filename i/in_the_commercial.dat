5|$|Mosley {{came up with}} an {{innovative}} way to dispose of the FIA's involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> activities of Formula One. In order to maintain Ecclestone's investment to deliver digital television, he proposed extending Ecclestone's rights for F1 coverage to 100 years from the initial 15, arguing that a deal of such length could not be anti-competition as it was effectively the same as an outright sale. The Commission agreed with his assessment and in the interest of impartiality, Mosley removed himself from the negotiations, which eventually returned around $300 million (£150 million).|$|E

5|$|The {{civil war}} {{ended with the}} Treaty of Winchester, late in 1153, which {{provided}} that Matilda's son Henry would succeed Stephen after his death.

But as there are no surviving coins, it seems that the mint was not in operation for long.

Religious duties required of the believers at this time were few: belief in God, asking for forgiveness of sins, offering frequent prayers, assisting others particularly those in need, rejecting cheating and the love of wealth (considered to be significant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> life of Mecca), being chaste and not killing newborn girls.|$|E
5|$|Between 1997 and 2000 Mosley {{repeatedly}} {{warned that}} if any EU decision went against the FIA, the marketing organisations and F1 itself would be moved out of Europe. In 1999, the EU Commission Directorate-General for Competition issued a Statement of Objections, listing a number of grievances surrounding the FIA's dealings with Ecclestone and Formula One. The FIA released the Statement {{to the media and}} held a press conference in Brussels ridiculing the Commission’s case. The Commission argued that a number of commercial agreements could be viewed as anti-competition and invited the FIA and Ecclestone's companies, ISC and FOA, to submit proposals to modify these arrangements. In 2001, nine months after settlement talks had begun, the parties reached an agreement to amend existing contracts, which included Ecclestone stepping down as the FIA's vice-president of promotional affairs and the FIA ending all involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> activities of Formula One.|$|E
5|$|He {{was elected}} to Parliament in 1805 for Gatton, a rotten borough, and became Solicitor General for England and Wales in 1812 and Attorney General for England and Wales a year later. Although not happy in Parliament, having been {{returned}} only for political purposes, Garrow acted {{as one of the}} principal Whig spokesmen trying to stop criminal law reform as campaigned for by Samuel Romilly and also attempted to pass legislation to condemn animal cruelty. In 1817, he was made a Baron of the Exchequer and a Serjeant-at-Law, forcing his resignation from Parliament, and he spent the next 15 years as a judge. He was not particularly successful <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> cases the Exchequer specialised in, but when on Assize, used his criminal law knowledge from his years at the Bar to great effect. On his resignation in 1832 he was made a Privy Councillor, a sign of the respect HM Government had for him. He died on 24 September 1840.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> {{center of}} the community, NY117 serves the Bedford Hills Metro-North station before {{widening}} to four lanes as it crosses the railroad tracks and connects to exit39 of the Saw Mill River Parkway. For the next mile (1.6km), NY117 runs alongside {{the northern edge of}} the Saw Mill River Parkway as it heads through another residential part of Bedford Hills as a two-lane road. At Harris Road, the route turns southeastward, crossing the parkway and the adjacent railroad tracks again as it intersects with the parkway's exit42. NY117's southeastward run on Harris Road ends just past the railroad crossing, where the highway turns northeast onto an unnamed road leading to a commercial and industrial area south of the hamlet of Katonah. After turning onto the highway, NY117 serves various businesses before the route ends at the southbound-only exit43 of the Saw Mill River Parkway. NY117 northbound feeds into the northbound direction of the parkway, while exit43 serves as the start of NY117 southbound.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1915, Tom Crisp Jr. left the vessel to join the Royal Navy. A few weeks later the U–boat threat {{expected}} so many months before arrived, as submarines surfaced among the undefended fishing fleets and used dynamite to destroy dozens of them after releasing the crews in small boats. This offensive {{was part of a}} wider German strategy to denude Britain of food supplies and took a heavy toll on the fishing fleets of the North Sea. George Borrow was among the victims, sunk in August, although it is not known if Crisp was aboard at the time. While temporarily working in a net factory following the loss of his vessel, he was scouted by a Navy officer recruiting experienced local fishing captains to command a flotilla of tiny fishing vessels, which were to be secretly armed. The boats were intended to be working fishing vessels fitted with a small artillery piece with which to sink enemy submarines as they surfaced alongside. In this manner it was hoped they would protect the fishing fleets without the diversion of major resources from the regular fleet, {{in the same manner as}} Q-ships deployed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> sea lanes.|$|E

5|$|Once the commandos {{finally got}} out of the tunnel, they both swam towards the {{broadside}} of Card which anchored near the opening of the sewer. As planned, Nao and Hung attached two bombs on the ship, with one near the bilge and one at the engine compartment, just above the water surface. After the bombs had been attached to Cards hull, Nao inspected both bombs to ensure they had been assembled properly. After that Nao stuck the battery onto a pole and connected it to the bombs with wires, then set the timer. At 1.10am, the bombs were completed and both commandos retreated back into the sewer tunnel, and climbed into their canoes {{on the other side and}} rowed back to Thu Thiem. Again, the police patrol boat was waiting for Nao and Hung to arrive, because the commander wanted another bribe. As Nao and Hung approached the patrol boat, an explosion was heard and a bright light could be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> port area. The South Vietnamese police patrol boat than started its engine and raced towards Card, instead of extracting another bribe.|$|E
5|$|P.atriplicifolia is {{frequently}} propagated by cuttings. Because its woody crown is resistant to division, softwood cuttings {{are taken from}} shoots near the base, generally in late spring. Hardwood cuttings selected in mid-to-late summer also provide a viable propagation technique. The plant is also grown from seed in cultivation. Such seeds require exposure to cold for 30–160 days to germinate, and seed-raised specimens may not preserve the characteristics of named cultivars. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> greenhouse or nursery setting, P.atriplicifolia relatively large size and rapid growth can adversely affect quality or make plants more difficult and expensive to transport; the use of plant growth regulators such as chlormequat chloride and daminozide may be more cost-effective than large-scale pruning.|$|E
5|$|The Jewish {{merchant}} community, {{which played}} a significant role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> development of then Bombay (now Mumbai), consisted of Jews from Iraq, Syria, and other Middle Eastern countries who immigrated in the late 18th century under the threat of persecution. They found the environment conducive to continuing their trade and settled in the city, becoming prosperous in business ventures such as textile mills and international trading. In 1784, the British government took over the East India Company. With this change, many business opportunities emerged in India, and Bombay in particular, encouraging immigrants to set up businesses. In 1790, one such business magnate was Shalom ben Ovadiah HaCohen, a Baghdadi Jew who had migrated from Aleppo (Halab), in Syria to Bombay; other Jewish businessmen from Baghdad, Basra, and Yemen followed him.|$|E
