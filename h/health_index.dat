Although {{the amount of work}} done on oral <b>health</b> <b>indexes</b> is far less that done on general <b>health</b> <b>indexes,</b> to date those developed share many of the same theoretical assumptions. For the most part they have shared the dominant biomedical paradigm and the underlying theory of illness. These theories significantly influence both the instruments developed to measure oral health and the methods of measurement adopted. More recently alternative, holistic theories of illness have been proposed {{and there has been a}} shift from instruments focused on the provider to those focused on the patient and a move from objective to subjective measures of oral health. Furthermore the relationship between oral health and general health has received insufficient attention. The paper examines the relationship between the theories of illness, methods of measurement, and oral <b>health</b> <b>indexes</b> and suggests that other holistic, patient centered, paradigms, using qualitative methods, should also be considered in the construction or oral <b>health</b> <b>indexes.</b> oral <b>health</b> status <b>health</b> <b>indexes...</b>|$|R

Understanding how such <b>health</b> <b>indices</b> vary {{in space and time}} is critical to their successful implementation as management tools. Here we compare autotrophic and heterotrophic coral <b>health</b> <b>indices,</b> examining specifically the temporal variation driven by the local environmental variation, at three scales (diel, daily and seasonal). We compared metabolic indices (RNA/DNA ratio, protein concentration) and autotrophic indices (Chlorophyll a (Chl a), zooxanthellae density, effective quantum yield (yield) and relative electron transport rate (rETR)) for two dominant Acropora species, A. digitifera and A. spicifera at Ningaloo Reef (north-western Australia) in August 2010 (austral winter) and February 2011 (austral summer). Clear seasonal patterns were documented for metabolic indices, zooxanthellae density and rETR, while cyclic diel patterns only occurred for yield and rETR, and RNA/DNA ratio. Significant daily variation was observed for RNA/DNA ratio, Chl a concentration, yield and rETR. Results suggest that zooxanthellae density and protein concentrations are good long-term indicators of coral health whose variance is largely seasonal, while RNA/DNA ratio and rETR can be used for both long-term (seasonal) and short-term (diel) coral monitoring. Chl a can be used to describe changes between days and yield for both diel and daily variations. Correlations between <b>health</b> <b>indices</b> and light history showed that short-term changes in irradiance had the strongest impact on all <b>health</b> <b>indices</b> except zooxanthellae density for A. digitifera; for A. spicifera no correlation was observed at all.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{intractable}} problems in international health research {{is the lack of}} comparability of health measures across countries or cultures. We develop a cross-country measurement model for health, in which functional limitations, self‐reports of health, and a physical measure are interrelated to construct <b>health</b> <b>indices.</b> To establish comparability across countries, we define the measurement scales by the physical measure while other parameters vary by country to reflect cultural and linguistic differences in response patterns. We find significant cross‐country variation in response styles of health reports along with variability in genuine health that is related to differences in national income. Our <b>health</b> <b>indices</b> achieve satisfactory reliability of about 80 % and their gradients by age, income, and wealth for the most part show the expected patterns.

40|$|Abstract Background An aging {{population}} poses significant challenges {{to health care}} in China. Health management has been implemented to reduce the costs of care, raise health service utilization, increase health knowledge and improve quality of life. Several studies have tried to verify the effectiveness of health management in achieving these goals worldwide. However, there have been insufficient randomized control trials (RCTs) to draw reliable conclusions. The few small-scale studies conducted in China include mostly the general population rather than the elderly. Our study is designed to evaluate the impact of community-based health management {{on the health of}} the elderly through an RCT in Nanjing, China. Methods Two thousand four hundred participants, aged 60 or older and who gave informed consent, were randomly allocated 1 : 1 into management and control groups, the randomization schedule was concealed from community health service center staff until allocation. Community-based health management was applied in the former while the latter was only given usual care. After 18 months, three categories of variables (subjective grading <b>health</b> <b>indices,</b> objective <b>health</b> <b>indices</b> and <b>health</b> service utilization) were measured based on a questionnaire, clinical monitoring and diagnostic measurements. Differences between the two groups were assessed before and after the intervention and analyzed with t -test, χ 2 -test, and multiple regression analysis.

Therefore this study aims to investigate the relationship between sitting and 5 <b>indices</b> of mental <b>health</b> in adults (psychological distress, depression, anxiety, somatization, and sleeping problems), and between sitting interactions (sittingxgender, sittingxage, sittingxeducation, and sittingxPA) and these mental <b>health</b> <b>indices.</b> Methods: A cohort of Belgian adults (25 - 64 years; n = 4344) provided self-reported data on sitting and PA and on 5 mental <b>health</b> <b>indices.</b> Cross-sectional associations were examined using multiple linear regression analyses.
