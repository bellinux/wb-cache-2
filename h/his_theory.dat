5|$|For Galileo, {{the tides}} {{were caused by}} the {{sloshing}} back and forth {{of water in the}} seas as a point on the Earth's surface sped up and slowed down because of the Earth's rotation on its axis and revolution around the Sun. He circulated his first account of the tides in 1616, addressed to Cardinal Orsini. <b>His</b> <b>theory</b> gave the first insight into the importance of the shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides; he correctly accounted, for instance, for the negligible tides halfway along the Adriatic Sea compared to those at the ends. As a general account of the cause of tides, however, <b>his</b> <b>theory</b> was a failure.|$|E
5|$|Hadley {{is known}} for <b>his</b> <b>theory</b> of animal {{property}} rights, according to which animals should be afforded property rights over their territory. Hadley has developed <b>his</b> <b>theory</b> of animal property rights through his doctoral research, his 2015 monograph, and other academic works. In addition, he has authored popular articles on the subject for The Guardian, The Conversation and The Ethics Centre. He also discussed the topic on Knowing Animals, a podcast series produced by Siobhan O'Sullivan. His proposal has received attention in the popular press, with strong criticism from farmers' groups and journalists writing on rural affairs.|$|E
50|$|A {{second factor}} was {{that many of}} <b>his</b> <b>theories</b> were not empirically testable.

5|$|The Ingenuity Gap is {{a popular}} science book. Homer-Dixon takes an inter-disciplinary {{approach}} connecting political science with sociology, economics, history, biology, and ecology. The narrative is structured as a travelogue as the author travels to meet experts and construct <b>his</b> <b>theory.</b> His observations along the way illustrate the concepts he is explaining and supplement interviews and research. Collecting pieces of <b>his</b> <b>theory</b> from each of his interviews and destinations appears as a recurring metaphor. He includes anecdotes and social commentary.|$|E

5|$|Beebe was {{relatively}} undeterred by the scientific community's acceptance of Heilmann's rejection of <b>his</b> <b>theory,</b> as {{is evidenced by}} the fact that he was still writing about his Tetrapteryx hypothesis well into the 1940s. His adherence to <b>his</b> <b>theory</b> was well-placed, as in 2003 a revolutionary discovery was made in the early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of Liaoning, China: Microraptor gui, the small, four-winged dromaeosaur that had led to renewed credence of the arboreal model for the origin of bird flight. This animal's most remarkable feature was the existence of long, pennaceous feathers on both its arms and legs, forming a set of four aerodynamic wings that its discoverers theorized were used for gliding. This discovery had the immediate effect of resurrecting the idea that leg feathers may have had some bearing on the origin of flight in birds, building on the idea originally proposed by Beebe and rejected by Heilmann.|$|E

5|$|By the 1850s, {{whether or}} not species evolved was a subject of intense debate, with {{prominent}} scientists arguing {{both sides of the}} issue. The publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species fundamentally transformed the discussion over biological origins. Darwin argued that his branching version of evolution explained a wealth of facts in biogeography, anatomy, embryology, and other fields of biology. He also provided the first cogent mechanism by which evolutionary change could persist: <b>his</b> <b>theory</b> of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's {{barnacle}} studies {{convinced him}} that variation arose constantly {{and not just in}} response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed the last part of his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. He now realised that the branching pattern of evolutionary divergence was explained by natural selection working constantly to improve adaptation. His thinking changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with <b>his</b> <b>theory.</b> He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in fancy pigeon breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, <b>his</b> <b>theory</b> was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{he worked}} on the Manhattan Project that {{developed}} the first atomic bombs. In 1949, he began developing <b>his</b> <b>theory</b> that, contrary to what was then believed, not all atomic nuclei are spherical. His ideas were later tested and confirmed by Aage Bohr's and Ben Mottelson's experiments. He also contributed to the scientific understanding of X-rays and participated in the United States Atomic Energy Commission and naval research projects.|$|E

5|$|Fodor {{also has}} {{positive}} arguments {{in favour of}} the reality of mental representations in terms of the LOT. He maintains that if language is the expression of thoughts and language is systematic, then thoughts must also be systematic. Fodor draws on the work of Noam Chomsky to both model <b>his</b> <b>theory</b> of the mind and to refute alternative architectures such as connectionism. Systematicity in natural languages was explained by Chomsky in terms of two more basic concepts: productivity and compositionality.|$|E
5|$|Homer-Dixon {{explains}} how <b>his</b> <b>theory</b> {{was influenced by}} endogenous or new growth theory in which ideas are a factor of production independent of labour and capital. He distinguishes his stance from Neo-Malthusianism which seeks to manage systems by controlling demand and from market fundamentalism which believe free markets can provide timely solutions to any problem. Several problems in advancing basic science are identified: human cognitive limits, intrinsic complexity of field, limits of scientific institutions, and social and cultural values regarding science.|$|E

5|$|Kohlberg's six stages {{can be more}} {{generally}} grouped into three levels of two stages each: pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional. Following Piaget's constructivist requirements for a stage model, as described in <b>his</b> <b>theory</b> of cognitive development, it is extremely rare to regress in stages—to lose the use of higher stage abilities. Stages cannot be skipped; each provides a new and necessary perspective, more comprehensive and differentiated than its predecessors but integrated with them.|$|E
