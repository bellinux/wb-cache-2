5|$|The Russian Spaniel is the {{youngest}} of the Russian gundogs. It originated mostly from English Cocker Spaniels and English Springer Spaniels. Breeds known as Russian Spaniels <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>mentioned</b> as early as 1891 in New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} sources, {{including}} Gardiner, {{claim that the}} ship suffered a number of cracks while firing the guns while ice-bound {{during the winter of}} 1877–78, but this incident cannot be confirmed by Russian-language sources. McLaughlin believes that any such incident would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>mentioned</b> if it occurred, as such sources are otherwise quite candid about the ship's drawbacks.|$|E
50|$|Deioces' name <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>mentioned</b> {{in various}} forms in {{different}} sources. Herodotus, a Greek historian, has stated his name as Dēiokēs Δηιόκης. In Assyrian texts, he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>mentioned</b> as Da-a-a-uk-ku; and in Elamite ones, as Da-a-(hi-)(ú-)uk-ka and Da-a-ya-u(k)-ka.|$|R

5|$|Antlions {{are poorly}} {{represented}} in the fossil record. Myrmeleontiformia is generally accepted to be a monophyletic group, and within the Myrmeleontoidea, the antlions' closest living relatives {{are thought to be}} the owlflies (Ascalaphidae). The predatory actions of the larvae have attracted attention throughout history, and antlions <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>mentioned</b> in literature since classical times.|$|E
5|$|The Duke of York {{was only}} one of many famous men to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>mentioned</b> in the lists; others {{included}} James Boswell, Ernest Augustus I of Hanover, the clergyman William Dodd, Charles James Fox, George IV, William Hickey, Francis Needham, 1st Earl of Kilmorey, Robert Walpole and many others.|$|E
5|$|Fleischmann and Weissmandl's rescue group, the Working Group, {{devised a}} more ambitious {{proposal}} in November that year. Known as the Europa plan or Grossplan, {{the aim was}} to bribe the SS with money from Jews overseas, primarily the United States, to stop the deportation of all Jews to Poland. Various sums <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>mentioned</b> in connection with this, including $2–3 million. Nothing came of it, reportedly because Heinrich Himmler intervened in August 1943.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the total}} number of the Robinsons who hid in the ruins of the city only a portion's names and {{locations}} are known. The recognized individuals are mostly the ones who either survived the war themselves or who came into contact with other survivors at some point. As such, the list of the known hideaways is not representative; the majority of the Robinsons died while in hiding, and hence their identities, were never recorded. The table below lists some of those who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>mentioned</b> in the memoirs or other written works on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Pasties <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>mentioned</b> in {{multiple}} literary works since the 12th century Arthurian romance Erec and Enide, written by Chrétien de Troyes, {{in which they}} are eaten by characters from the area now known as Cornwall. There is a mention in Havelok the Dane, another romance written {{at the end of the}} thirteenth century; in the 14th century Robin Hood tales; in Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales; and in three plays by William Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|Another {{composition}} {{from the}} song genre, also mentioned by Fisk and others, as intimately {{related to the}} last sonatas, and also depicting a feeling of wandering and homelessness, is the Winterreise (A Winter's Journey) song cycle. Numerous connections between different songs from the cycle and the sonatas, especially the C minor Sonata, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>mentioned.</b> For example: in the C minor Sonata, the first movement's development section recalls the songs Erstarrung and Der Lindenbaum; the second movement and the finale recall the songs Das Wirtshaus, Gefrorne Tranen, Gute Nacht, Auf dem Flusse, Der Wegweiser, and Einsamkeit. These allusions to Winterreise retain the alienated, lonely atmosphere of its songs.|$|E
50|$|The Vasseti Group also {{caters to}} {{lifestyle}} concepts through its Vasseti Life Concepts (VLC) business. So far the main product that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>is</b> the Vasseti Lifestyle Privilege Card {{which aims to}} provide cardholders with benefits in retail, food and beverage, travel, and more. Though this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>mentioned,</b> no official launching has taken place yet.|$|R

5|$|Jean de Florette {{was filmed}} {{in and around}} the Vaucluse {{department}} of Provence, where a number of different places <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>mentioned</b> as filming locations. La Treille, east of Marseille, in the Bouches-du-Rhône department, was the village where Pagnol had shot the original film. The village is now within the city limits of Marseille and has undergone extensive development since the 1950s, so Berri had to find alternatives. For the village of the story he settled on Mirabeau (65km to the north), while Jean de Florette's house is located in Vaugines, where the church from the film can also be found. The market scenes were filmed in Sommières in the Gard, and the story's Les Romarins was in reality Riboux in the Var.|$|E
5|$|Gernot Wilhelm saw no {{ground for}} Richter's {{assumption}} concerning {{the identification of}} the Nuhaššite monarch with the Qaṭanean king. This identification rests on the theory that Qatna belonged geographically to the region of Nuhašše, but no solid evidence supports this assumption, and the Shattiwaza treaty between the Hittites and Mitannians clearly mentioned Qatna as a different realm from Nuhašše during the first Syrian war when the Nuhaššite king ruled. If Qatna was part of the Nuhaššite kingdom, its submission to the Hittites would not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>mentioned</b> separately in the treaty. It is a fact that Qatna was ruled by Idanda during the first war and the Hittite documents do not mention a change of rulers in Qatna made by Šuppiluliuma, leaving no reason to suspect that Idanda ascended the throne {{as a result of the}} war. Jacques Freu likewise rejected Richter's hypothesis. Citing different arguments, he concluded that Adad-Nirari of Nuhašše was a contemporary of Idanda, the successor of the Qaṭanean Adad-Nirari.|$|E
5|$|Limbert and Roworth have commented that, {{unlike other}} peat areas, {{such as the}} Somerset Levels, where {{recording}} of the industrial heritage has been systematic, the recording of the industrial archaeology of Thorne and Hatfield Moors has been notably scarce. A guide to the industrial history of South Yorkshire published in 1995 {{made no mention of}} peat at all. The canals dug by the Dutch and operated until the 1920s <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>mentioned</b> by canal historians such as Charles Hadfield, but have never been investigated systematically. The railways have received a little more attention in the specialist press, and some of the locomotives have been preserved. The history of the workers has been partially recorded through the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Oral History Project. In contrast, the ecology of the moors has been better documented, through the publication of the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Papers, first published by the Doncaster Naturalists Society in 1987. Since 1989, the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Conservation Forum have taken over this responsibility. These papers now run to eight volumes, and the forum has also published technical papers on many aspects of the moors.|$|E
