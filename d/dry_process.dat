25|$|Coffee {{berries and}} their seeds undergo several {{processes}} {{before they become}} the familiar roasted coffee. Berries have been traditionally selectively picked by hand; a labor-intensive method, it involves the selection of only the berries {{at the peak of}} ripeness. More commonly, crops are strip picked, where all berries are harvested simultaneously regardless of ripeness by person or machine. After picking, green coffee is processed by one of two methods—the <b>dry</b> <b>process</b> method, simpler and less labor-intensive as the berries can be strip picked, and the wet process method, which incorporates fermentation into the process and yields a mild coffee.|$|E
6000|$|The man {{seated next}} to Bill was of a very {{different}} type: he was a Methodist brickmaker who, after spending thirty {{years of his life}} in perfect satisfaction with his ignorance, had lately [...] "got religion," [...] and along with it the desire to read the Bible. But with him, too, learning was a heavy business, and on his way out to-night he had offered as usual a special prayer for help, seeing that he had undertaken this hard task with a single eye to the nourishment of his soul--that he might have a greater abundance of texts and hymns wherewith to banish evil memories and the temptations of old habit--or, in brief language, the devil. For the brickmaker had been a notorious poacher, and was suspected, though there was no good evidence against him, of being the man who had shot a neighbouring gamekeeper in the leg. However that might be, it is certain that shortly after the accident referred to, which was coincident with the arrival of an awakening Methodist preacher at Treddleston, a great change had been observed in the brickmaker; and though he was still known in the neighbourhood by his old sobriquet of [...] "Brimstone," [...] there was nothing he held in so much horror as any further transactions with that evil-smelling element. He was a broad-chested fellow with a fervid temperament, which helped him better in imbibing religious ideas than in the <b>dry</b> <b>process</b> of acquiring the mere human knowledge of the alphabet. Indeed, he had been already a little shaken in his resolution by a brother Methodist, who assured him that the letter was a mere obstruction to the Spirit, and expressed a fear that Brimstone was too eager for the knowledge that puffeth up.|$|E

40|$|In Portugal, {{the variety}} of S. Bartholomew (Pyrus communis L.) pears are subject to an artisan <b>drying</b> <b>process</b> {{consisting}} of direct open-air sun exposure, leading to a traditional product with unique texture characteristics, called “Pêra Passa de Viseu”. However, the <b>drying</b> <b>process</b> does not provide the current standards of safety and, therefore, recent investigations have emerged with alternatives to the traditional <b>drying</b> <b>process.</b> The changes {{that occur in the}} pears during the <b>drying</b> <b>process</b> are of the most importance to define the sensory characteristics and the quality of this product. As the texture is a highly valued characteristic for this product, it is necessary to verify that the different drying methods give place to products as similar to the traditional as possible. Thus, this study aimed at determining the changes that occur in the texture with the <b>drying</b> <b>process</b> and compare the texture of pears dried by two different <b>drying</b> <b>processes,</b> namely the traditional open-air and the solar stove with ventilation. Pears of the Portuguese variety S. Bartholomew were obtained from a local producer, both in the fresh state and after drying by the traditional procedure. Some of the fresh pears were dried by the alternative method. From the results obtained, it was possible to observe that both <b>drying</b> <b>processes</b> affected the initial texture. However, no important differences were seen when the two drying methods were compared with each other, thus allowing to conclude that the alternative drying methodology can be used to replace the traditional one, without altering the textural properties of the final product and with an highly added value in food safety...|$|R

50|$|As {{production}} increased, {{the transport}} of limestone and silica clay from the quarry to the plant needed to become more efficient. The standard gauge railway that had operated since {{the opening of the}} factory was replaced initially by dump-trucks, before being superseded by conveyor belts.

This kiln produced clinker by the <b>dry</b> <b>process,</b> as opposed to Kilns 1 - 6 which heated the crushed lime and clay as a slurry mixture. <b>Dry</b> <b>process</b> kilns were much more efficient as there was no water to evaporate first. Kiln 7 also featured a Preheater which heated the raw meal using the kiln exhaust gases to around 800 Degrees before entering the main Kiln.

5000|$|The {{pressure}} tank {{made possible the}} development of the Chicago meat industry in the US, with its concentration in one geographic area, because it allowed the economic disposal of byproducts which would otherwise overwhelm the environment in that area. At first, small companies that sprang up near the packers did the rendering. Later the packers entered the rendering industry. Gustavus Swift, Nelson Morris, and Lucius Darling were among the early pioneers of the US rendering industry with their personal backing and/or direct participation in the rendering industry. [...] Innovations came rapidly in the 20th century. Some of these were the uses for rendered products, and others were the rendering methods. In the 1920s, a batch dry rendering process was invented; the material was cooked in horizontal steam-jacketed cylinders (similar to the fertilizer dryers of the day). Advantages claimed for the <b>dry</b> <b>process</b> were economy of energy, better protein yield, faster processing, and fewer obnoxious odors. Over the years, the wet [...] "tanking" [...] process was replaced with the <b>dry</b> <b>process.</b> By the end of World War II, most rendering installations used the <b>dry</b> <b>process.</b> In the 1960s, continuous dry processes were introduced, one using a variation of the conventional dry cooker and the other making use of a mincing and evaporation process to dry the material and yield the fat. In the 1980s, high energy costs popularized the various [...] "wet" [...] continuous processes. These processes were more energy efficient and allowed the re-use of process vapours to pre-heat or dry the materials during the process.|$|E
