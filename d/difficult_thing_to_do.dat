25|$|While some whites {{responded with}} {{violence}} or exploitation of Mexicans, another recurring effort was Americanization. Since many Mexicans were now {{a part of}} the United States, it was expected that they would act like Americans. The national language in the U.S. is English, so it was thought that the Mexican Americans should be speaking English like the rest of Americans. In 1907, United States’ President Theodore Roosevelt wrote, “We have room for but one language in this country, and that is the English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house”. It was clear that a lot of Americans were hostile towards Spanish speaking Mexicans. The English Only movement is a political movement for establishing English as the only official language in the U.S., and using only English in official government operations. Learning a new language as an adult is a very <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> so this effect of imperialism was challenging for a lot of new Americans.|$|E
500|$|Mason {{has said}} he was nervous about filming Chris's coming out. Describing the scene, he said [...] "I did {{have to stand up}} in front a group of people and tell them , I was gay. That was a little intimidating". The actor felt that the storyline had been handled in a {{realistic}} manner and said that it shows that coming out is a <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Mason also spoke to a friend about his coming out experience to gain information about how long it took him to come out and how people reacted. The storyline follows Chris's struggle with his sexuality and depicts the reactions of his friends and family. It also deals with the issue of homophobia in sport. The Australian gay and lesbian newspaper, SX News said [...] "Chris is the captain of the school basketball team, but once word he's gay gets out to the other teams it turns nasty for him".|$|E
500|$|He got {{his first}} job writing for {{television}} on the sitcom Three's Company in 1983. Through his cousin, Mirkin met writer George Tricker who became his mentor. Tricker wrote for the Three's Company spin-off The Ropers so Mirkin wrote a spec script for an episode of The Ropers. Although rejected by the producers of The Ropers, Three's Company creator Bernie West {{was impressed by the}} script and Mirkin began pitching ideas for that series instead. Mirkin pitched to the series' story editors for several years without success because they had very limited script buying power. He was eventually able to pitch to the show's producers, who bought a script from him, and then hired him as a staff writer. Mirkin was apprehensive about the job because he was aiming to work on Cheers, a show more focused on character-driven humor which Mirkin preferred writing, but felt he could not turn the opportunity down. Mirkin considered Three's Company to have [...] "a classic French farce structure", as [...] "the characters were so stupid they could never say anything clever." [...] This meant Mirkin had to adapt his preference for character-driven comedy to fit the show; it [...] "forced you to put all the cleverness into the plot, a much more <b>difficult</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> The plot had to get all the laughs". Mirkin felt the experience [...] "taught [...] a lot about structure" [...] which greatly aided his later work on character-focused shows.|$|E

Pierre Berton, Margaret Atwood and Shirley Douglas, as well as PEN, the Writer's Union, the Guild, the Producer's Association, and many others defended the series. Military historian Desmond Morton stated, [...] "As the McKennas' critics discovered, one of the most <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in a free society is to criticize the media...Anyone criticizing the media will find them judge, jury, and defence lawyer in their own case." [...] The Senate sub-committee ultimately sided with the veterans' complaints against the filmmakers.

Simply put, although the filmmakers have a right to their point of view, they have failed to present that point of view with any degree of accuracy or fairness." ...|$|R
40|$|Computer {{vision is}} a {{difficult}} subject to teach. One of the most <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when teaching computer vision is develop good assignments. Many of us have both succeeded and failed in this task. Computer vision can also be an expensive topic to teach, {{both in terms of}} equipment and the time required to set up hardware and acquire high-quality data sets. Different institutions have different capabilities, but few have the variety of resources necessary to cover all of the topics in a computer vision course. This paper describes an ongoing project to bring the successes and capabilities of many institutions together into a comprehensive on-line resource for computer vision education. This resource will contain vetted assignments and homeworks, complete with data sets and solutions. In addition, it will contain educational resources such as lecture notes, links to other computer vision courses, and reviews of textbooks, software, and hardware. We will accomplish this objective by collecting materials from computer vision educators, developing new materials, and organizing and building a comprehensive web site from which to serve them. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a positive {{philosophy of life}} developed to support and inspire patients to take more {{responsibility for their own}} lives and to draw more efficiently on their known or hidden resources. The idea is that everybody can become wiser, use themselves better, and thus improve quality of life, subjective health, and the ability to function. To be responsible means to see yourself as the cause of your own existence and state of being. To be the one who forms your own life to your liking, so that others do not shape it in the way they prefer to see you. Seen this way, taking responsibility in practice {{is one of the most}} <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> One of the greatest and most <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in this context is to be able to love. To be the one who loves, instead of being the one who demands love, care, awareness, respect, and acceptance from somebody else. Since almost all of us have had parents who maybe loved us too little and mostly conditionally, we all harbor a deep yearning to be loved as we are, unconditionally. A lot of our energy is spent trying to find recognition and acceptance, more or less as we did as children from our parents, who created the framework and defined the rules of the game. But today, reality is different. We have grown up and now life is about shaping our own existence. So we must be the ones who love. This is what responsibility is all about. Taking responsibility is, quite literally, moving the barriers in our lives inside ourselves. Taking responsibility for life means that you are willing to see that the real barriers are not all these external ones, but something that can be found within yourself. Of course there is an outside world that cannot be easily shaped according to your dreams. But a responsible point of view is that although it is difficult, the problem is not impossible; it is your real challenge and task. If there is something you really want, you can achieve it, but whether it happens depends on your wholehearted, goal-oriented, and continuous attempts. This paper describes the philosophy about seizing the meaning of life and becoming well again, even when there is little time left...|$|R

HP was not only innovative in its product development. The company’s industrial relations should also be considered; its management was more “open” than conventions of the company’s day. Dave Packard devised “ 11 simple rules” that formed a contract between the management and employees which emphasized equality, mutual respect, work appreciation, always being involved in attending to detail, mutual understanding, and acceptance, as well as culturing a sincere willingness to collaborate amicably with others. HP was the first company in the USA to introduce flexitime and provided a medical insurance health plan. With an eye on not only recruiting the best candidates for jobs, but also retaining them, HP introduced a profit-sharing plan in 1957 so that all employees with 6  months’ service could share in the company’s profitability. Thereby, they also enhanced employee motivation to achieve greater innovation and productivity. Dave Packard is quoted as saying, “Investing in new product development and expanding the product catalog are the most <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in hard times, and also among the most important” ([URL] HP was disruptive not only in its technological advancements but also in its management systems, frontrunners for the liberal, non-hierarchical ways in which Google and Apple deal with their employees’ creative inclinations.|$|R

Only after work-ing closely with the people at the Station on a one-to-one basis did I grasp how totally dedicated they are to you, the New York agricultural producer, and your concerns. If it is of concern to you, there is someone probably working on it at the Experiment Sta-tion.

5000|$|According to the BFI's Monthly Film Bulletin, [...] "there is {{something}} [...] absurd about this well-meaning, ambitious film....It {{could well be}} that Pinter's brilliance is altogether {{the wrong kind of}} brilliance to let loose on the scripting of this already nerve-raw, nightmarish subject.

Part of their tragedy is that bores, willy-nilly, seem often ridiculous. So the last thing a seriously-intentioned writer can afford <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is heap further grotesqueries upon them. But this is what has happened in Pinter's often genuinely amusing script. For every justified extravagance [...] - [...] in the characteristically ghastly party scene, for instance, or Maggie Smith's gushing [...] as Philpott - there are a dozen which are not. The poor, crazy lady in the hair-dresser's is a schematic and surely rather portentous case in point; so is the Zoo, and Harrods, Jo's gloomy hats, and that windmill love nest, and the tiresome ambiguity of that psychiatrist off to Tenerife (is he perceptive, or unsympathetic, a good doctor or just a fashionable one?). Doubtless some kind of pseudo-Antonioni, pseudo-Fellini comment is being made on our society, but if this is indeed so then the glee and the ambivalence are significantly more telling, and certainly more apparent, than any clarity of focus." ...|$|R

Controlling the slideshow without effecting their presentation skill is a very <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Based on the observation and research, to solve this problem, presenter need something that they can use to control their slideshow remotely while reducing the interruption with their presentation flows.

Mobile application is suitable for current daily activity. Because people nowadays used smartphone and bring their smartphone everywhere even at working space.

40|$|This phenomenological study {{describes}} the lived experience of mothering a child hospitalised with acute illness or injury. Seven mothers {{who had experienced}} this crisis within twelve months of our first interview agreed to share their stories with me. The resulting data were analysed and interpreted using van Manen's interpretation of Heideggerian phenomenology. Four phenomenological themes emerged from this study. Mothers have {{a special kind of}} knowing. They have a need <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with and for their child. Handing over to or leaving their child in the care of strangers and waiting for their child to be returned to their care are very <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> for mothers <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Their constant vigilance is enabled by their special kind of knowing and their need <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> The difficulty of handing over, leaving and waiting is emphasised by mothers' constant vigilance. Personal experiences during the course of my study presented significant challenges to my ability to offer an effective phenomenological description of the phenomenon under study. Continuous reflection aided by dialogue with fellow phenomenological researchers has resulted in a meaningful narrative. This description of mothering in a context of crisis is useful in the potential contribution it makes to nurses' understanding of mothers' experience of the hospitalisation of their children. It supports the philosophy of family-centered care and highlights the ability of individual nurses to make a positive difference to a very stressful experience...|$|R
