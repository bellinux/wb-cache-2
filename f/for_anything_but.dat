5|$|Wu {{also has}} another YouTube account going by the {{username}} JumbaFund, which donated {{all of its}} earnings to a charity that viewers suggested. Wu donated over 5,000 dollars to a charity in Kenya, which later built a school after him, {{to build a new}} school in a span of 5 months from all of the profits he made through JumbaFund. He recently cited that he would now donate all earnings from this point on to Kenya in order to help finish and pay off the costs of the new secondary school being built there. Wu mentions this in his video and always records himself donating all the profits to the charity in order to show the viewers that his JumbaFund charity is not used <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> to donate to the needy.|$|E
25|$|The late 12th {{and early}} 13th century, rabbi Meir of Rothenburg ruled that, in a {{community}} consisting entirely of kohanim, the prohibition on calling kohanim <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> the first two and maftir aliyot creates a deadlock situation which should be resolved by calling women to the Torah for all the intermediate aliyot.|$|E

25|$|During this time, Yugoslavia's first {{nuclear reactor}} was under {{construction}} in Krsko, built by US-based Westinghouse. The project ultimately took until 1980 to complete because of disputes with the United States about certain guarantees that Belgrade had {{to sign off on}} before it could receive nuclear materials (which included the promise {{that they would not be}} sold to third parties or used <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> peaceful purposes).|$|E
25|$|Several schemes assist {{managing}} programmer activity so {{that fewer}} bugs are produced. Software engineering (which addresses software design issues as well) applies many techniques to prevent defects. For example, formal program specifications state the exact behavior of programs so that design bugs may be eliminated. Unfortunately, formal specifications are impractical <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> the shortest programs, because of problems of combinatorial explosion and indeterminacy.|$|E
25|$|There {{was in fact}} little {{practical}} need <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> real {{values of}} the gamma function until the 1930s, when applications for the complex gamma function were discovered in theoretical physics.

Unlike with Windows 3.1, IBM did {{not have access to}} the source code for Windows 95 and was unwilling to commit the time and resources to emulate the moving target of the Win32 API. IBM later introduced OS/2 into the United States v. Microsoft case, blaming unfair marketing tactics on Microsoft's part.|$|E
25|$|Until recently, {{there was}} little {{evidence}} <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> an early and short Roman occupation of Cornwall, and there have so far been only three finds in Penzance. In August 1899 two coins of Vespasian (69–79 AD) were found in an ancient trench in Penzance Cemetery. The coins were eight feet below ground together with some cow bones, and {{are now in the}} Penlee House Museum. A 1934 find from the Alverton area is described as a ″coin of the reign of Constantine the Great″, and was also donated to the museum. A 30mm (1 3/16in) sestertius was found on a building site in or around Penzance about ten years previously, and was presented to the Royal Institution of Cornwall. Larger quantities of Roman coins have been found nearby, at Marazion Marsh and Kerris in Paul parish, but {{there is no evidence of}} any Roman settlement in the area, although nearby villages such as Chysauster were occupied at this time.|$|E

This {{is not to say}} that his first TV programmes were bad – they were, indeed, highly diverting entertainment". The programmes were also highly popular both with the public and other cooks. Following his death of heart disease in September 2009 several fellow chefs voiced their opinions of him. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall considers that Floyd [...] "cooked his ingredients with the love and passion of a gifted amateur", while Heston Blumenthal opines that [...] "His enthusiasm, even when he was being a bit crotchety, jumped out of the screen. No-one made TV food programmes quite like him. He had a wealth of knowledge but there was a no-nonsense approach to it all".|$|E

500|$|Sleep hygiene is the {{recommended}} behavioral and environmental practice that {{is intended to}} promote better quality sleep. This recommendation {{was developed in the}} late 1970s as a method to help people with mild to moderate insomnia, but, , the evidence for effectiveness of individual recommendations is [...] "limited and inconclusive". [...] Clinicians assess the sleep hygiene of people who present with insomnia and other conditions, such as depression, and offer recommendations based on the assessment. [...] Sleep hygiene recommendations include establishing a regular sleep schedule, using naps with care, not exercising physically or mentally too close to bedtime, limiting worry, limiting exposure to light in the hours before sleep, getting out of bed if sleep does not come, not using bed <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> sleep and sex, avoiding alcohol as well as nicotine, caffeine, and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime, and having a peaceful, comfortable and dark sleep environment.|$|E
500|$|Both of Hale's {{parents died}} {{before he was}} five; Joanna in 1612, and Robert in 1614. It was then {{revealed}} that Robert had been so generous in giving money to the poor that at his death his estate provided only £100 of income a year, of which £20 was {{to be paid to}} the local poor. Hale thus passed into the care of Anthony Kingscot, one of his father's relatives. A strong Puritan, Kingscot had Hale taught by a Mr. Stanton, the vicar of Wotton known as the [...] "scandalous vicar" [...] due to his extremist puritan views. On 20 October 1626, at the age of 16, Hale matriculated at the University of Oxford as a member of Magdalen Hall, with the goal of becoming a priest. [...] Both Kingscot and Stanton had intended this to be his career, and his education had been conducted with that in mind. He was taught by Obadiah Sedgwick, another Puritan, and excelled in both his studies and fencing. Hale also regularly attended church, private prayer-meetings, and was described as [...] "simple in his attire, and rather aesthetic". After a company of actors came to Oxford, Hale attended so many plays and other social activities that his studies began to suffer, and he began to turn away from Puritanism. In light of this, he abandoned his desire to become a priest and instead decided to become a soldier. His relatives were unable to persuade him to become a priest, or even a lawyer, with Hale describing lawyers as [...] "a barbarous set of people unfit <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> their own trade".|$|E
500|$|When he escapes the {{building}} and enters the mall, Hall feels he is disturbed by advertisements calling to him by name {{not only because they}} will give away his presence, but also because they remind him of his lost place in society, and he begins [...] "to see through the false consciousness his (illusory) previous position as fixed subject had allowed him." [...] Spielberg said that Anderton is being punished for his previous callous unconcern <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> the effectiveness of the PreCrime program. [...] "He's dirtied {{by the fact that he}} doesn't spend much time thinking about the moral consequences. It's just like a sporting event almost — and then suddenly that whole sporting event makes him the soccer ball." [...] His doubts about his own future lead him to examine his previous life to better understand himself according to Hall. He runs through his role in the PreCrime system, and his son's disappearance [...] "to reconstruct his past." [...] After Leo Crow in fact kills himself, Anderton becomes healed, and later has [...] "recreated himself as the subject he was previously through the knowledge that he is not a killer." [...] Although he has satisfactorily repaired his self-image, Anderton is not the same person, as he not longer believes in the PreCrime system. Hall says that Burgess' final dilemma; namely, his desire to keep PreCrime running, his inability to bring himself to kill Anderton, and his desire to live, drives him to see his only suitable action to be suicide. [...] "Burgess has been left truly alone by events," [...] argues Hall. [...] "His wife fainted when she saw the images of the murder and Anderton has been the cause of this rupture." ...|$|E

2500|$|The word [...] "Scotch" [...] was {{the favored}} {{adjective}} for things [...] "of Scotland", including people, {{until the early}} 19th century, when it {{was replaced by the}} word [...] "Scottish".

2500|$|For Zwemer, the Church was {{precious}} {{because it}} was indeed ‘the Church of God which He purchased with His own blood.’ His view on denominations was ecumenical and generous and far from the parochial tendency occasionally demonstrated in the Reformed tradition. The Arabian Board he set up was expressly ‘undenominational.’ He is able to praise Popes Gregory VII and Innocent III. He longed for the day Orthodox churches would join in with Muslim evangelism. His opening editorial for The Moslem World stated that it aimed ‘to represent no faction or fraction of the Church, but to be broad {{in the best sense}} of the word.’ His slogan was: ‘In essentials it seeks unity, in non-essentials liberty, and in all things charity.’ Yet, he was clear and precise about what the essentials were. Such desire for ecumenism was fed by his all-pervasive passion for mission to Islam: ‘the issues at stake are too vital and the urgency too great <b>for</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> united front.’ ...|$|E
