50|$|Traditional {{processes}} do {{not adequately}} sequester heavy metals, and the sludge can also contain manmade organic compounds that are {{extremely difficult to}} break down. Some critics assert that the disposal of this sludge is not responsibly overseen in the United States, so the <b>excess</b> <b>sludge</b> is sometimes spread on public forest or even agricultural land, dumped in landfills or the ocean, and sometimes incinerated. This not only pollutes the environment with unnaturally high concentrations of toxins but also wastes a valuable resource.

50|$|The {{amount of}} sewage sludge {{produced}} {{is proportional to the}} amount and concentration of wastewater treated, and it also depends on the type of wastewater treatment process used. It can be expressed as kg dry solids per cubic metre of wastewater treated. The total sludge production from a wastewater treatment process is the sum of sludge from primary settling tanks (if {{they are part of the}} process configuration) plus <b>excess</b> <b>sludge</b> from the biological treatment step. For example, primary sedimentation produces about 110-170 kg/ML of so-called primary sludge, with a value of 150 kg/ML regarded as being typical for municipal wastewater in the U.S. or Europe. The sludge production is expressed as kg of dry solids produced per ML of wastewater treated; one mega litre (ML) is 103 m3. Of the biological treatment processes, the activated sludge process produces about 70-100 kg/ML of waste activated sludge, and a trickling filter process produces slightly less sludge from the biological part of the process: 60-100 kg/ML. This means that the total sludge production of an activated sludge process that uses primary sedimentation tanks is in the range of 180-270 kg/ML, being the sum of primary sludge and waste activated sludge.|$|E

40|$|The article {{describes}} the variants of reagent stabilization, which is an essential stage of sludge treatment of sewage treatment facilities There are many variants of stabilization, {{which are based on}} the mineralization of organic matter, the impact on microorganisms (heating, treatment with chemicals, which have a bactericidal effect, adjustment of pH and humidity) to suppress their activity. In comparison with biological methods reagent stabilization requires minimal capital costs and provides carrying out the process in a short time. Promising method is to be used while stabilizing of waste containing organic substances with microstatic and microbocide action, and which do not change the composition of sediments. In this paper as reagents to stabilize was used the liquid waste and wastewater generated in the production and application of urea-formaldehyde resins (UFR), which are characterized by high levels of formalde-hyde. Flow rate of liquid waste (formaldehyde content of 14. 2 g/dm 3) was changed in the ranges from 1 : 100 to 20 : 100, the flow of wastewater (formaldehyde content of 0. 5 − 7. 0 g/dm 3) in the varies from 1 : 10 to 1 : 2.

50|$|Conventional {{nitrogen}} {{removal from}} ammonium-rich wastewater is accomplished {{in two separate}} steps: nitrification, which is mediated by aerobic ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria and denitrification carried out by denitrifiers, which reduce nitrate to N2 with the input of suitable electron donors. Aeration and input of organic substrates (typically methanol) show that these two processes are: (1) highly energy consuming, (2) associated with the production of <b>excess</b> <b>sludge</b> and (3) produce significant amounts of green-house gases such as CO2 and N2O and ozone-depleting NO. Because anammox bacteria convert ammonium and nitrite directly to N2 anaerobically, this process does not require aeration and other electron donors. Nevertheless, oxygen is still required {{for the production of}} nitrite by ammonia-oxiding bacteria. However, in partial nitritation/anammox systems, oxygen demand is greatly reduced because only half of the ammonium needs to be oxidized to nitrite instead of full conversion to nitrate. The autotrophic nature of anammox bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria guarantee a low yield and thus less sludge production. Additionally, anammox bacteria easily form stable self-aggregated biofilm (granules) allowing reliable operation of compact systems characterized by high biomass concentration and conversion rate up to 5-10 kg N m−3. Overall, {{it has been shown that}} efficient application of the anammox process in wastewater treatment results in a cost reduction of up to 60% as well as lower CO2 emissions.|$|E

40|$|Treatment and {{disposal}} of <b>excess</b> <b>sludge</b> produced in an activated sludge process has become an environmental challenge in densely populated urban areas due to difficulty to locate suitable sites for landfill and incineration. Therefore, reduction/minimization of <b>excess</b> <b>sludge</b> within activated sludge processes may be an ideal solution. This study focuses {{on the use of}} a modified activated sludge process, named the oxic-settling-anaerobic (OSA) system, to achieve an effective reduction in <b>excess</b> <b>sludge</b> production. Its key feature is to insert a sludge holding tank in the sludge return circuit to provide an anaerobic sludge zone. The objectives of the study are to: 1) demonstrate the <b>excess</b> <b>sludge</b> reduction in an OSA system; 2) evaluate the appropriate operating conditions; and 3) study the mechanisms of <b>excess</b> <b>sludge</b> reduction, so as to maximize the <b>excess</b> <b>sludge</b> reduction efficiency of the OSA system. In continuous-flow studies, an OSA system was operated in parallel with an activated sludge process as a reference system to investigate the effects of the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) level and the sludge anaerobic exposure time (SAET) in the sludge holding tank on the sludge reduction. The intended level of ORP was maintained by periodical pure nitrogen purging thus preventing the pH drop by chasing the gaseous product in the sludge holding tank. SAET was regulated by changing the pumping rate of the return sludge from settling tank. In batch studies, proposed mechanisms involving soluble microbial products (SMPs) effects, microbial population effects and sludge decay effects were verified. In addition, a COD balance was carried out to supplement the understanding of the mechanisms. The main findings of my research are : 1) the OSA system had a lower sludge yield and oxygen demand than the reference system under the same solids quantity condition, which demonstrated that an OSA system could provide a cost-effective solution for <b>excess</b> <b>sludge</b> reduction; 2) the OSA system improved COD removal efficiency and sludge settleability; 3) a low ORP in the sludge holding tank favored the <b>excess</b> <b>sludge</b> reduction; 4) low sludge growth yield, soluble microbial products (SMPs) effect and microbial predator contribution were unable to explain the <b>excess</b> <b>sludge</b> reduction; and 5) the <b>excess</b> <b>sludge</b> reduction in an OSA system was mainly due to increased sludge decay in the sludge holding tank under an anaerobic condition and the utilization of COD generated from the sludge decay through denitrification, sulfate reduction, phosphorus release and volatile organic gas production that occurred in the sludge holding tank of the OSA system, among which, the contribution of gaseous production was significant.

The findings showed reduction in volatile solids approx. by 6 % when dosing min FeCl 3 · 6 H 2 O and 15 % when dosing max FeCl 3 · 6 H 2 O into feed sludge. Gas volume produced during the digestion of the un-dosed sludge was 90 – 160 ml/d and 60 – 125 ml/d in min Fe-dosed sludge and 45 - 95 ml/d. Also, correlation between VS loadings and biogas production was found. A rise in VS loading from 0, 64 g/l/d to 1, 01 g/l/d increased biogas production from 90 ml/d to 140 – 160 ml/d.

40|$|The {{purification}} {{capacity of the}} contact stabilisation system at Birzeit University campus has been studied for two years. The oxidation capacity of organic matter, ammonium oxidation, and denitrification potential were determined. The reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD) was 85 %, and the effluent COD concentration was less than 110 mg/l (the average value was 88 mg/l). Suspended solids were removed with equal efficiency. The aerobic stabilization of organic solids was efficient, and no <b>excess</b> biosolids (<b>sludge)</b> had to be removed. High nitrification (70 % of the influent nitrogen were nitrified) could be maintained at 15 °C, and 42 % of the oxidised nitrogen was denitrified. The specific oxygenation capacity of the treatment system is relatively high and reached about 5 kwh/kg COD. The specific wastewater treatment cost is about 0. 52 US$/m³ or about 58 US$ per population equivalent per year. Based on the results obtained, batch operation and intermittent aeration of the biological process are suggested to achieve high effluent quality and to reduce power consumption...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The 3 AMBR {{technology}} {{had been}} put into use in a sewage treatment plant of Kunming in 2010, emission standards {{at the national level}} A standard, and running in good condition currently. This paper based on the four seasons along the data of the water plant, the operating principle, situation and existing problems of 3 AMBR technology were deeply discussed through analyzing the path parameter data process (DO, ORP, TN, TP, NH 3 -N, NO 3 -N, MLSS, COD). The research found that the technology had advantages of effluent in good quality, stable operation and less sludge, at the same time existed some phenomenon of <b>excess</b> aeration, long <b>sludge</b> age and water shortage of carbon source...|$|R
