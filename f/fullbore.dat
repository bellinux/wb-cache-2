500|$|The {{sport of}} target rifle {{shooting}} {{is an option}} among those in the 3rd year and above, but only available {{to members of the}} CCF from 4th form. In the first and second years, there is an air rifle club, which teaches basics before moving onto [...] "rifles". From 3rd form students can join an afternoon shooting club in which they can practice smallbore. At this point being a member of CCF is not needed because CCF starts from 3rd form since the introduction of the EXAD program to 3rd formers. 3rd form students start of with grouping targets using sandbags then progress onto 5 bull and eventually 5 bull and country life style shooting using slings and jackets. However as of 2016/17 the number 8 cadet rifles are being brought out of service so 3rd form shooting has mostly been done using [...] "private" [...] Anschutz rifles. Normally students wouldn't start shooting these rifles until 4th form but due to the situation they have to use these rifles.Those individuals who have talent in smallbore then have the opportunity to shoot <b>fullbore</b> in the summer term during some weekends and even have the chance to take part in competitions such as schools meet or the L In 4th form During the first two terms they do smallbore shooting with 10 bull being the main focus. 10 Bull is done using the private rifles that are more expensive and more accurate than the number 8s. In the trinity term they do <b>fullbore</b> using the L81a2 cadet target rifle.Though they usually have smaller numbers during the summer due to logistical issues and the fact that other [...] "fun"games options are also available such as tennis and sailing. All <b>fullbore</b> shooting is done at Bisley either at Century where they shoot at 300, 500 and 600 yards, or Stickledown range where they can shoot up to 1200 yards though this rarely happens during practice and is instead reserved for the Imperial meeting. In 2017 the RGS entered a main VIII and two cadet pairs into the Schools Meet as well as 4 boys into the NRA Imperial and 2 boys into the Cadets Imperial a newer competition that started in 2016. The RGS also took part in many postal competitions such as the Country life and the Surrey 10 bull league competitions. Over the years the shooting team {{have had a lot of}} success, not only winning many smallbore competitions such as the Staniforth and the Country Life, but also winning the Ashburton at the Annual Schools Meeting held at Bisley, though this hasn't been done by the school for many years. Part of this success is down to the help of many Old Guildfordians and current teachers coaching and helping out those doing shooting at the RGS. Many senior boys also coach the younger students and encourage them to keep shooting as they progress through the school. Those in the team are taught by the Old Guildfordians and shooting masters how to self sight and even self wind coach so that they can take part in more individual competitions such as the Imperial. Countless RGS shooters have gone on to become top level shooters competing at a national level representing Great Britain as well as achieving great individual success such as winning the Queens prize. Ex RGS students have also had great success shooting in Schools Veterans competitions under the Old Guildfordians Rifle club. The Old Guildfordians is a home office approved shooting club and has a club house down at Bisley nicknamed the OG hut or Jabba the hut. The OGs are known for their hilarious antics such as making making members carry around object such as pineapples or melons as a punishment for dropping a point on their last shot or doing silly things such as forgetting their rifles ...|$|E
