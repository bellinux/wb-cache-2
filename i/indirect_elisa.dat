5000|$|The enzyme {{acts as an}} amplifier; even if only few {{enzyme-linked}} antibodies remain bound, {{the enzyme}} molecules will produce many signal molecules. Within common-sense limitations, the enzyme can go on producing color indefinitely, but the more antibody is bound, the faster the color will develop. A major disadvantage of the direct ELISA is the method of antigen immobilization is not specific; when serum is used {{as the source of}} test antigen, all proteins in the sample may stick to the microtiter plate well, so small concentrations of analyte in serum must compete with other serum proteins when binding to the well surface.

5000|$|Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is an assay that {{utilizes}} {{the principle}} of antibody-antigen recognition to test {{for the presence of}} certain substances. The three main types of ELISA tests which are <b>indirect</b> <b>ELISA,</b> sandwich ELISA, and competitive ELISA all rely on the fact that antibodies have an affinity for only one specific antigen. Furthermore, these antigens or antibodies can be attached to enzymes which can react to create a colorimetric result indicating the presence of the antibody or antigen of interest. [...] Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays are used most commonly as diagnostic tests to detect HIV antibodies in blood samples to test for HIV, human chorionic gonadotropin molecules in urine to indicate pregnancy, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis antibodies in blood to test patients for tuberculosis. Furthermore, ELISA is also widely used as a toxicology screen to test people's serum for the presence of illegal drugs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Flavivirus {{cross-reactive}} antibodies {{in human}} sera {{interfere with the}} definitive identification of dengue virus (DENV) infections especially in areas with multiple co-circulating flaviviruses. Use of DENV envelope domain-III (EDIII) can partially resolve the problem. This study has examined the effect of (i) incorporating the EDIIIs of four DENV serotypes into a single chimeric antigen, and (ii) immobilizing the antigen through specific interaction on the sensitivity and specificity of anti-DENV antibody detection. Methods A sera panel (n = 164) was assembled and characterized using commercial kits for infection by DENV {{and a host of}} other pathogens. Anti-DENV antibodies of both IgM and IgG classes in this panel were detected in <b>indirect</b> <b>ELISAs</b> using a mixture of monovalent EDIIIs, a chimeric EDIII-based tetravalent antigen, EDIII-T, and a biotinylated version of the latter as coating antigens. The sensitivity and specificity of these assays were compared to those obtained using the PanBio Dengue IgG/IgM ELISAs. Results The performance of dengue IgG and IgM <b>indirect</b> <b>ELISAs,</b> using either a physical mixture of four EDIIIs or the single chimeric EDIII-T antigen, were comparable. Coating of a biotinylated version of the tetravalent antigen on streptavidin plates enhanced sensitivity without compromising specificity. Conclusions The incorporation of the EDIIIs of the four DENV serotypes into a single chimeric antigen did not adversely affect assay outcome in <b>indirect</b> <b>ELISAs.</b> Oriented, rather than random, immobilization of the tetravalent antigen enhanced sensitivity of detection of anti-DENV antibodies with retention of 100 % specificity. </p...|$|R
40|$|Fasciolosis is a {{cosmopolitan}} parasitosis medical-veterinary importance caused by Fasciola hepatica, which affects sheep, goats and cattle; and it affects man accidentally causing an epidemic-endemic infection difficult to diagnose. The {{aim was to}} develop an <b>indirect</b> sandwich <b>ELISA</b> with 3 antibodies for detecting excretory-secretory antigens of Fasciola hepatica (ESFh). For the development of <b>indirect</b> sandwich <b>ELISA</b> were used, as capture antibody, mouse polyclonal antibodies anti ESFh and polyclonal antibodies rabbit anti-ESFh as detection antibody, at the concentrations of 10 and 5 µg/mL respectively. The conjugate used was mouse monoclonal anti- total immunoglobulins rabbit linked to peroxidase (1 / 1000). Were analized 31 sheep fecal samples, {{and the results were}} compared with those obtained by direct coproparasitological examination (DC) and counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIEP). The detection limit obtained for <b>indirect</b> sandwich <b>ELISA</b> was 100 ng/mL.

40|$|Two {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay (ELISA) - based detection systems: <b>indirect</b> competitive <b>ELISA</b> and biotinylated double antibody sandwich ELISA (DAS-ELISA) {{were developed}} to determine the melittin concentration in honeybee (Apis mellifera) venom and the melittin concentration in cosmetics which contain bee venom. The <b>indirect</b> competitive <b>ELISA</b> employed chicken anti-melittin IgY. The biotinylated DAS-ELISA employed anti-melittin monoclonal antibody (MAb) and biotinylated anti-melittin IgY. To produce anti-melittin IgY; Sigma melittin was emulsified with Freund‘s incomplete adjuvant and immunised to Leghorn laying chickens intramuscularly at four different sites (50 μg/mL, 0. 25 mL per site) of the breast muscles. After 5 to 8 weeks of the immunisation, anti-melittin IgY was extracted and analysed by ELISA. The anti-melittin IgY antibody produced was highly specific to melittin and did not cross-react with other bee venom proteins, as examined by ELISA and a western-blot assay. <b>Indirect</b> competitive <b>ELISA</b> demonstrated a higher range of melittin detection (2. 5 to 80 μg/mL). Double antibody sandwich ELISA using MAb as the capture antibody and biotinylated polyclonal IgY as the detection antibody, provided a lower range of detection (2. 5 - 40 ng/mL), which has a 1000 times higher sensitivity than that of <b>indirect</b> competitive <b>ELISA.</b> Therefore, <b>indirect</b> competitive <b>ELISA</b> is a useful tool to measure the concentration of melittin in bee venom as a raw material.

The hapten DNSHA was first designed and used to covalently couple to BSA to form an immunogen which was immunized to rabbits to produce a polyclonal antibody against DNSH. Furthermore, a novel 3, 5 -dinitrosalicylic acidovalbumin (DNSA-OVA) immunoconjugate structurally different from DNSHA-OVA was designed and used as a Ã¢Â€Âœsubstructural coating antigenÃ¢Â€Â to improve the sensitivity of an <b>indirect</b> <b>ELISA</b> analysis for a direct DNSH detection. Based on the Ã¢Â€Âœsubstructural coating antigenÃ¢Â€Â concept, an optimized <b>indirect</b> <b>ELISA</b> method was established that exhibited good specificity and high sensitivity for detecting DNSH, with a cross-reactivity of less than 0. 1 % (excluding the parent compound nifursol), IC 50 of 0. 217 nmol/mL and detection limit of 0. 018 nmol/mL. Finally, a simple and efficient analysis of DNSH samples in chicken tissues showed that the average recovery rate of the <b>indirect</b> <b>ELISA</b> analysis was 82. 3 %, with the average coefficient of variation 15. 9 %.

The pilot survey of the three types of food and beverage products for the presence of BPA residues was conducted using three developed ELISAs. For generating 4 -tert-OP antibodies, 6 haptens based on OP and NP structures (OPA, OPB, OP 1, NPA, NPB and NP 1) were synthesised. Specific antibodies against OPA-protein conjugate, OPB-protein conjugate and OP 1 -protein conjugate were generated and characterised using the direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>ELISAs</b> in 32 antibody/enzyme conjugate combinations. The most sensitive assay for 4 -tert-OP was based on the antibody against OP 1 hapten with the NP 1 -BSA conjugate (Ab&# 61621;OP 1 # 3 /NP 1 -BSA). The assay exhibited an IC 50 of 100 µg L- 1, and a LOD of 10 µg L- 1. In the end, thiolated BPA modified spherical gold nanoparticles with different epitope coverage were synthesised and tested in competitive and displacement ELISA to measure functionality. The minimum epitope coverage required for antibody binding in this study was determined to be 4. 4 × 10 - 10 mol cm- 2. Comparing to hapten-protein conjugates in a conventional ELISA, in which epitope coverage is difficult to control, nanoparticles offer greater control of nanoparticle coverage and hence valency. Multivalent conjugation of small molecule epitope on the surface of nanoparticles can act as protein conjugate to bind to the specific antibodies...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine seroprevalence of brucellosis in non vaccinated goats in different areas in Mosulcity and to compare Rose Bengal and <b>indirect</b> <b>ELISA</b> tests for the detection of the antibodies. A total of 102 blood serumsamples were examined, representing 396 goats distributed in different areas. Results of Rose Bengal test showed that the totalseroprevalence of brucellosis was (6. 8 %) and the highest rate in Al-Rahmania (11. 1 %), and lowest (7. 1 %) in Al-Muthana area. No seroprevalence of Brucellosis was recorded in Googjaly and Basheka areas. <b>Indirect</b> <b>ELISA</b> test showed that the totalpercentage was (24. 5 %) and the highest (55 %) were reported in Al-Rahmania area and the lowest percentage was (10 %) inBasheka area.

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} {{for the detection of}} Echinococcus granulosus specific antibodies in dogs by indirect-ezyme linked immunosorbent assay. Two different antigens viz., somatic and excretory secretory (E/S) antigens were prepared from E. granulosus adult worm. Totally 250 field dog serum samples were examined for the detection of anti-E. granulosus antibodies using somatic and excretory secretory antigens of E. granulosus. The specific antibodies of E. granulosus to somatic and excretory secretory antigen were detected in 62 (24. 8 per cent) and 81 (32. 4 per cent) dog serum samples by <b>indirect</b> <b>ELISA.</b> The sensitivity and specificity of <b>indirect</b> <b>ELISA</b> with somatic antigen was found to be 100 and 71. 60 per cent respectively. However the sensitivity and specificity of <b>indirect</b> <b>ELISA</b> with excretory secretory antigen was found to be 100 and 79. 20 per cent. It was concluded that the indirect-ELISA can be effectively used for specific detection of Echinococcus granulosus infection in dogs and can be used to ascertain the actual status of the E. granulosus infection in dogs in an endemic area.

40|$|Sera from uterine {{cervical}} cancer patients (CaCx patients), healthy control and other cancer patients were examined for their IgG and IgM antibody titers against Herpes simplex virus type- 1 (HSV- 1) and type- 2 (HSV- 2) early antigens (EA) by using antibody capture direct {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (direct-ELISA). IgM and IgG antibody titer distribution against HSV- 2 EA were compared among CaCx patients, healthy control and other cancer patients. Significant difference in their IgM antibody titer distribution against HSV- 2 EA at 2 % significance level was observed between CaCx patients and healthy control and also between CaCx patients and other cancer patients. Percentage of the specimens with IgM titers exceeding the upper limit of healthy controls (13 ELISA titer) was 6 % for CaCx patients but 0 % for other cancer patients. In contrast, difference was not observed in IgM titers against HSV- 1 EA and in IgG titers against HSV- 1 EA and - 2 EA between CaCx patients and healthy control. However, percentage of the specimens with HSV- 1 EA IgM titers exceeding the upper limit of healthy controls (11 ELISA titer) was 6 % for CaCx patients, 1. 9 % for other cancer patients, IgM and IgG antibody titers against HSV- 2 EA measured by direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>ELISA</b> methods were compared among CaCx patients, healthy control and other cancer patients. Correlation between direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>ELISA</b> titers was not observed in those three groups. There were 29 (14. 8 %) CaCx patients with titer exceeding the upper limit of healthy control measured by either direct-or indirect-IgM ELISA. Five CaCx patients showed titers exceeding the upper limit of healthy control by both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>ELISA,</b> and 4 of them were found in stage 0 of {{cervical cancer}}. However, even among those with high level of IgM ELISA titers, correlation between direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>ELISA</b> titers was not observed. These results suggested that antibodies measured by direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>ELISA</b> were raised against different kinds of early antigens. For the practical use, <b>indirect</b> <b>ELISA</b> method was superior to direct method because {{of the level of}} the antibody titers, frequency of detecting positives among in CaCx patients and more easy preparation of the antigens...|$|E
40|$|Many animal species, {{including}} macropods, {{have the}} potential to act as atypical reservoirs of the causative agent of Q fever, Coxiella burnetii. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the seroprevalence of C. burnetii in various macropod species in Australia. Competitive and <b>indirect</b> <b>ELISAs</b> were developed for the testing of macropod sera for antibodies to phase 11 and 1 C. burnetii antigens separately. A total of 500 macropod serum samples from selected species sampled in eastern and western coastal states of Australia were screened for the presence of anti-C. burnetii antibodies. An overall seroprevalence of 20. 8 % (95 % CI 20. 8 - 20. 9 %) was observed with 30. 4 % (30. 2 - 30. 9 %) in northern Queensland, 13. 0 % (12. 9 - 13. 1 %) in southern Queensland, 7. 1 % (7. 1 - 8. 0 %) in western Queensland and 22. 8 % (22. 7 - 22. 9 %) in south-western Western Australia. These data indicated that macropods represented a potential reservoir for zoonotic transmission of C. burnetii to domestic animals and the human population. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion {{proteins}} {{are used}} frequently for investigating protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. The present study {{demonstrates that the}} use of GST fusion proteins caused false positives during selection of phage-displayed single-chain antibody fragments (scFvs) specific for three domains of the movement protein (NSM) of tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV). To identify and exclude the false positives when using GST as a fusion partner linked to the antigen of interest, indirect phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was compared with capture phage ELISA. Of 210 enriched phage clones, <b>indirect</b> phage <b>ELISA</b> identified 106 clones specific for binding to GST-domain fusions but not to GST. In contrast, using capture phage ELISA, all 106 selected clones were identified as false positives, reacting with the GST fusion proteins and GST. This was confirmed by characterization of soluble scFv antibodies. The data indicate that GST fusion proteins seem unsuitable for screening of phage-displayed antibody fragments and it is essential to use capture phage ELISA, instead of the <b>indirect</b> phage <b>ELISA</b> used commonly to exclude false positives in characterization of selected clones with GST fusion proteins. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The {{control of}} animal {{salmonellosis}} is {{considered as a}} major objective in Europe and <b>indirect</b> <b>ELISAs</b> will be important tools {{for the implementation of}} control programs for this infection in pigs. We analyse the results yielded by three commercial ELISAs (Herdcheck Swine Salmonella, SALMOTYPE Pig Screen, and PrioCHECK Salmonella) on meat juice samples from a population of slaughter pigs of Aragon, NW Spain, to assess their efficacy using traditional and latent-class approaches. Overall, the Herdcheck Swine Salmonella detected more Salmonella-infected pigs than the other two tests, but its relative sensitivity was low (65. 9 %). A similar result was observed when only serotypes detectable by this test were considered (69. 1 %). When a Bayesian approach was used the Herdcheck Swine Salmonella showed also the highest overall accuracy (sensitivity = 88 % and specificity = 74 %). Our results suggest that a relatively small proportion of the observed prevalence in herds would be explained by using these ELISAs. Also, this study points out that when different ELISA tests are used within the same herd, results may differ substantially. Thus, caution is advised if it is decided to use these assays for herd health classification in Spanish Salmonella control program...|$|R
