5|$|Concentrated {{hydrochloric}} acid (fuming {{hydrochloric acid}}) forms acidic mists. Both the mist and the solution have a corrosive effect on human tissue, {{with the potential}} to damage respiratory organs, eyes, skin, and <b>intestines</b> irreversibly. Upon mixing hydrochloric acid with common oxidizing chemicals, such as sodium hypochlorite (bleach, NaClO) or potassium permanganate (KMnO4), the toxic gas chlorine is produced.|$|E
5|$|Seeds {{and fruit}} form the major {{component}} of the diets of pigeons and doves. In fact, the family {{can be divided into}} the seed-eating or granivorous species (subfamily Columbinae) and the fruit-and-mast-eating or frugivorous species (the other four subfamilies). The granivorous species typically feed on seed found on the ground, whereas the frugivorous species tend to feed in trees. There are morphological adaptations {{that can be used to}} distinguish between the two groups: granivores tend to have thick walls in their gizzards, <b>intestines,</b> and esophagi whereas the frugivores tend to have thin walls. In addition, fruit-eating species have short <b>intestines</b> whereas those that eat seeds have longer ones. Frugivores are capable of clinging to branches and even hang upside down to reach fruit.|$|E
25|$|The lower {{gastrointestinal}} tract includes {{most of the}} small <b>intestine</b> {{and all of the}} large <b>intestine.</b> In human anatomy, the <b>intestine</b> (bowel, or gut) is the segment of the {{gastrointestinal tract}} extending from the pyloric sphincter of the stomach to the anus and, in humans and other mammals, consists of two segments, the small <b>intestine</b> and the large <b>intestine.</b> In humans, the small <b>intestine</b> is further subdivided into the duodenum, jejunum and ileum while the large <b>intestine</b> is subdivided into the cecum, colon, rectum, and anal canal.|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the results of}} computed tomography (CT) of the liver, spleen, abomasum, small <b>intestine</b> and large <b>intestine</b> in 30 healthy Saanen goats. CT examination and anatomical slice preparation postmortem were performed {{as described in the}} first communication. After subjective evaluation of the CT images, various variables including the length/size, volume and density of the liver, spleen and gallbladder, the wall thickness of the abomasum, small <b>intestine</b> and large <b>intestine</b> and the diameter of the <b>intestine</b> were measured. The liver, spleen, abomasum, small <b>intestine</b> and large <b>intestine</b> could be accurately visualised using CT...|$|R
50|$|The lower {{gastrointestinal}} tract (GI), includes the small <b>intestine</b> {{and all of}} the large <b>intestine.</b> The <b>intestine</b> is also called the bowel or the gut. The lower GI starts at the pyloric sphincter of the stomach and finishes at the anus. The small <b>intestine</b> is subdivided into the duodenum, the jejunum and the ileum. The cecum marks the division between the small and large <b>intestine.</b> The large <b>intestine</b> includes the rectum and anal canal.|$|R
5|$|Termites can {{distinguish}} nestmates and non-nestmates through chemical communication and gut symbionts: chemicals consisting of hydrocarbons {{released from the}} cuticle allow the recognition of alien termite species. Each colony has its own distinct odour. This odour {{is a result of}} genetic and environmental factors such as the termites' diet and the composition of the bacteria within the termites' <b>intestines.</b>|$|E
5|$|The koala is {{featured}} in the Dreamtime stories and mythology of indigenous Australians. The Tharawal people believed that the animal helped row the boat that {{brought them to the}} continent. Another myth tells of how a tribe killed a koala and used its long <b>intestines</b> to create a bridge for people {{from other parts of the}} world. This narrative highlights the koala's status as a game animal and the length of its <b>intestines.</b> Several stories tell of how the koala lost its tail. In one, a kangaroo cuts it off to punish the koala for being lazy and greedy. Tribes in both Queensland and Victoria regarded the koala as a wise animal and sought its advice. Bidjara-speaking people credited the koala for turning barren lands into lush forests. The animal is also depicted in rock carvings, though not as much as some other species.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrounded}} sac {{becomes the}} primitive gut. Sections of this gut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, {{such as the}} esophagus, stomach, and <b>intestines.</b> The esophagus develops {{as part of the}} foregut tube. The innervation of the esophagus develops from the pharyngeal arches.|$|E
5000|$|The ileum [...] is {{the final}} section of the small <b>intestine</b> in most higher vertebrates, {{including}} mammals, reptiles, and birds. In fish, the divisions of the small <b>intestine</b> are not as clear and the terms posterior <b>intestine</b> or distal <b>intestine</b> may be used instead of ileum.|$|R
50|$|The small <b>intestine</b> {{contains}} a trace amount of microorganisms {{due to the}} proximity and influence of the stomach. Gram-positive cocci and rod-shaped bacteria are the predominant microorganisms found in the small <b>intestine.</b> However, in the distal portion of the small <b>intestine</b> alkaline conditions support gram-negative bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae. The bacterial flora of the small <b>intestine</b> aid {{in a wide range}} of intestinal functions. The bacterial flora provide regulatory signals that enable the development and utility of the gut. Overgrowth of bacteria in the small <b>intestine</b> can lead to intestinal failure. In addition the large <b>intestine</b> contains the largest bacterial ecosystem in the human body. About 99% of the large <b>intestine</b> and feces flora are made up of obligate anaerobes such as Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium. Factors that disrupt the microorganism population of the large <b>intestine</b> include antibiotics, stress, and parasites.|$|R
50|$|There is {{no small}} <b>intestine</b> as such in non-teleost fish, such as sharks, sturgeons, and lungfish. Instead, the {{digestive}} part of the gut forms a spiral <b>intestine,</b> connecting the stomach to the rectum. In this type of gut, the <b>intestine</b> itself is relatively straight, but has a long fold running along the inner surface in a spiral fashion, sometimes for dozens of turns. This valve greatly increases both the surface area and the effective length of the <b>intestine.</b> The lining of the spiral <b>intestine</b> {{is similar to that}} of the small <b>intestine</b> in teleosts and non-mammalian tetrapods.|$|R
5|$|They {{are more}} {{attracted}} to the chemicals found in the <b>intestines</b> of many species, {{and as a result}} often linger near or in sewage outfalls. Some species, such as nurse sharks, have external barbels that greatly increase their ability to sense prey.|$|E
5|$|Wolves {{supplement}} their diet with {{fruit and vegetable}} matter. They willingly eat the berries of mountain ash, lily of the valley, bilberries, blueberries and cowberry. Other fruits include nightshade, apples and pears. They readily visit melon fields during the summer months. A well-fed wolf stores fat under the skin, around the heart, <b>intestines,</b> kidneys, and bone marrow, particularly during the autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|Zinc may {{be held in}} {{metallothionein}} reserves within microorganisms or in the <b>intestines</b> or liver of animals. Metallothionein in intestinal {{cells is}} capable of adjusting absorption of zinc by 15–40%. However, inadequate or excessive zinc intake can be harmful; excess zinc particularly impairs copper absorption because metallothionein absorbs both metals.|$|E

50|$|There is a wider {{distance}} between haustra than between the circular {{folds of the}} small <b>intestine,</b> and the haustra don't reach around the entire circumference of the <b>intestine,</b> in contrast to circular folds of the small <b>intestine</b> that do. These differences can assist in distinguishing the small <b>intestine</b> from the colon on an abdominal x-ray.|$|R

5|$|Bears have {{a fairly}} simple {{digestive}} system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated <b>intestines</b> and no cecum. Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must {{spend much of their}} time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.|$|E
5|$|Dendritic cells (DC) are phagocytes in tissues {{that are}} {{in contact with the}} {{external}} environment; therefore, they are located mainly in the skin, nose, lungs, stomach, and <b>intestines.</b> They are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites, as both have many spine-like projections, but dendritic cells are in no way connected to the nervous system. Dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they present antigens to T cells, one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|Dendritic {{cells are}} {{specialized}} antigen-presenting cells {{that have long}} outgrowths called dendrites, that help to engulf microbes and other invaders. Dendritic cells {{are present in the}} tissues that are in contact with the external environment, mainly the skin, the inner lining of the nose, the lungs, the stomach, and the <b>intestines.</b> Once activated, they mature and migrate to the lymphoid tissues where they interact with T cells and B cells to initiate and orchestrate the adaptive immune response.|$|E
50|$|When food {{particles}} are sufficiently reduced {{in size and}} composition, they are absorbed by the intestinal wall and transported to the bloodstream. Some food material is passed from the small <b>intestine</b> to the large <b>intestine.</b> In the large <b>intestine,</b> bacteria break down proteins and starches in chyme that were not digested fully in the small <b>intestine.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{duodenum}} is {{the first}} section of the small <b>intestine</b> in most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds. In fish, the divisions of the small <b>intestine</b> are not as clear, and the terms anterior <b>intestine</b> or proximal <b>intestine</b> may be used instead of duodenum. [...] In mammals the duodenum may be the principal site for iron absorption.|$|R
50|$|The small <b>intestine</b> {{is where}} most {{chemical}} digestion takes place. Many of the digestive enzymes that {{act in the}} small <b>intestine</b> are secreted by the pancreas and liver and enter the small <b>intestine</b> via the pancreatic duct. Pancreatic enzymes and bile from the gallbladder enter the small <b>intestine</b> {{in response to the}} hormone cholecystokinin, which is produced in the small <b>intestine</b> in response to the presence of nutrients. Secretin, another hormone produced in the small <b>intestine,</b> causes additional effects on the pancreas, where it promotes the release of bicarbonate into the duodenum in order to neutralize the potentially harmful acid coming from the stomach.|$|R
5|$|In June 1943, after {{returning}} to command of X Corps, Horrocks sustained serious injuries during an air raid at Bizerte, while watching an amphibious rehearsal by the 46th Infantry Division for Operation Avalanche, the Salerno landings. Bullets from a strafing German fighter struck his upper chest and carried on through his body, piercing his lungs, stomach, and <b>intestines.</b> He underwent five operations and spent fourteenmonths recovering. He was replaced as commander of X Corps by Lieutenant-General Sir Richard McCreery.|$|E
5|$|Its {{toxicity}} {{is due to}} tetrodotoxin, {{which is}} concentrated particularly in the liver, ovaries, <b>intestines</b> and skin. Many species of pufferfish bear this toxin, obtaining it from tetrodotoxin-containing bacteria in their diet. Eating the fish can have fatal consequences. The symptoms of poisoning, which are predominantly neurological, include ataxia, in addition to numbness and/or paraesthesia (tingling) around the mouth, lips, and limb extremities. Cases of pets being poisoned have occurred when the fish have been left where they can eat them.|$|E
5|$|Like {{almost any}} herbivore, they consume other plants if {{presented}} with them, but their diet in nature consists {{almost entirely of}} grass, with only minimal consumption of aquatic plants. Hippos are born with sterile <b>intestines,</b> and require bacteria obtained from their mothers' feces to digest vegetation. Hippos have (rarely) been filmed eating carrion, usually close to the water. There are other reports of meat-eating, and even cannibalism and predation. The stomach anatomy of a hippo is not suited to carnivory, and meat-eating is likely caused by aberrant behaviour or nutritional stress.|$|E
30|$|Rat {{residence}} {{times were}} converted to human residence times and OLINDA/EXM was {{used to calculate the}} dose to target organs. The value of <b>intestine</b> was split up among the upper large <b>intestine</b> (ULI), lower large <b>intestine</b> (LLI), and the small <b>intestine</b> (SI), by proportion to the mass of these three organs. The salivary glands were added to the remainder in this analysis.|$|R

30|$|High {{absorbed dose}} in humans was {{observed}} in the gallbladder (333 ± 251 μGy/MBq), liver (77.5 ± 14.5 μGy/MBq), small <b>intestine</b> (33.6 ± 30.7 μGy/MBq), upper large <b>intestine</b> (29.8 ± 15.0 μGy/MBq) and lower large <b>intestine</b> (25.2 ± 12.6 μGy/MBq). In mice, high absorbed doses were observed in the small <b>intestine</b> (38.5 μGy/MBq), liver (25.5 μGy/MBq) and urinary bladder wall (43.1 μGy/MBq) for [18 F]FACT (Table  3).|$|R
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{differences}} between the digestive systems of sharks and mammals is that sharks have much shorter <b>intestines.</b> This short length is achieved by the spiral valve with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long tube-like intestine. The valve provides a long surface area, requiring food to circulate inside the short gut until fully digested, when remaining waste products pass into the cloaca.|$|E
5|$|Sai Baba's disciples and devotees {{claim that}} he {{performed}} many miracles such as bilocation, levitation, mindreading, materialisation, exorcisms, entering a state of Samādhi at will, lighting lamps with water, removing his limbs or <b>intestines</b> and sticking them back to his body (khandana yoga), curing the incurably sick, appearing beaten when another was beaten, preventing a mosque from falling down on people, and helping his devotees in other miraculous ways. He also gave Darshan (vision) {{to people in the}} form of Sri Rama, Krishna, Vithoba, Shiva and many other gods depending on the faith of devotees.|$|E
5|$|Soluble {{fluorides}} are moderately toxic: 5–10g sodium fluoride, or 32–64mg fluoride ions per kilogram of body mass, {{represents a}} lethal dose for adults. One-fifth of the lethal dose can cause adverse health effects, and chronic excess consumption {{may lead to}} skeletal fluorosis, which affects millions in Asia and Africa. Ingested fluoride forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach which is easily absorbed by the <b>intestines,</b> where it crosses cell membranes, binds with calcium and interferes with various enzymes, before urinary excretion. Exposure limits are determined by urine testing of the body's ability to clear fluoride ions.|$|E

50|$|Once {{processed}} and digested by the stomach, the milky chyme is squeezed through the pyloric sphincter {{into the small}} <b>intestine.</b> Once past the stomach, a typical peristaltic wave only lasts for a few seconds, travelling at only a few centimeters per second. Its primary purpose is to mix the chyme in the <b>intestine</b> rather than to move it forward in the <b>intestine.</b> Through this process of mixing and continued digestion and absorption of nutrients, the chyme gradually works {{its way through the}} small <b>intestine</b> to the large <b>intestine.</b>|$|R
50|$|The small <b>intestine</b> {{or small}} bowel {{is the part}} of the {{gastrointestinal}} tract between the stomach and the large <b>intestine,</b> and is where most of the end absorption of food takes place. The small <b>intestine</b> has three distinct regions - the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The duodenum is the shortest part of the small <b>intestine</b> and is where preparation for absorption begins. It also receives bile and pancreatic juice through the pancreatic duct, controlled by the sphincter of Oddi. The primary function of the small <b>intestine</b> is the absorption of nutrients and minerals from food.|$|R
