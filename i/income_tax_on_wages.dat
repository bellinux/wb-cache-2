30|$|The {{so-called}} “non-wage costs” {{refer to}} the part of total labor cost that is {{not directly related to}} actual working hours, including <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> <b>wages,</b> employers’ and employees’ contributions to the social security premiums and unemployment insurance fund. These costs create a wedge between the cost the employer has to bear for hiring an employee and the wage received by the employee. As the wedge gets wider, the labor cost incurred by employers increases and employers become less willing to hire new workers in the formal sector. A widely used indicator to measure the weight of non-wage costs is tax wedge. It is calculated as the ratio of income taxes plus employers’ and employees’ social security contributions (SSC) to total labor cost. The largest portion of the financial burden of labor taxes is incurred by employers in the majority of the OECD countries, including Turkey OECD (2010).|$|E
