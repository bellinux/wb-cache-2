50|$|Several {{telephone}} {{models were}} derived from the basic model 500, {{using some of the}} same components. The model 554 was a wall-mounted version. Other special purpose models included additional features. This included phones with <b>dial</b> <b>lights</b> (500U), party line sets (501), keysets (540 and 560 series), call directors, panel phones (750 series), industrial and outdoor phones (520 and 525), and automatic dialers (660).|$|R
50|$|The {{conductors}} {{other than}} the two central tip and ring conductors are in practice variously used {{for a second or}} third telephone line, a ground for selective ringers, low-voltage power for a <b>dial</b> <b>light,</b> or for anti-tinkle circuitry to prevent pulse dialing phones from sounding the bell on other extensions.|$|E
50|$|The {{contacts}} {{other than}} the two central tip and ring contacts are in practice used for various things such {{as a ground for}} selective ringers, low voltage power for a <b>dial</b> <b>light,</b> or for 'anti-tinkle' circuitry to prevent pulse dialing phones from ringing the bell on other extensions. With tone dialing, anti-tinkle measures are not required.|$|E
50|$|In the Trimline version {{designed}} for connection to an RJ11 telephone jack, pins 2 and 5 (black and yellow) may carry very low voltage AC or DC power. While {{the phone line}} itself (tip and ring) supplies enough power for most telephones, older telephone instruments with incandescent dial lights in them (such as the classic Western Electric Princess and Trimline models) needed different voltages and more current than the phone line could supply. Typically, the power on pins 2 and 5 came from a transformer plugged into a power outlet near one telephone jack, wired to supply power to just that telephone (or {{to all of the}} jacks in the house, depending on local telephone company practices). It is now usually recommended that only the one local jack used by such older telephones be wired for power, to avoid any potential interference with other types of service that might be using pins 2 and 5 (black and yellow pair) in jacks {{in other parts of the}} house. The early Trimline and Princess phone <b>dial</b> <b>light</b> incandescent lamps were rated at 6.3 Volts, 0.25 Amp and the transformer output is approximately 6-8 Volts AC. Later Trimline versions had LED light sources, powered directly from the phone line, and the last Western Electric-made Princess version had no <b>dial</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The first Trimline models used {{incandescent}} <b>dial</b> <b>lights</b> {{powered by}} a power transformer plugged into a standard 120VAC outlet. The bulky transformer {{and the need for}} a conveniently-placed 120-volt outlet was criticized by many consumers, but was necessary because of the power demands of the incandescent light bulb. Years later, Western Electric redesigned the Trimline to use a low-power green LED backlit dial powered by current from the phone line, eliminating the need for a separate transformer. Always eager to re-use its older stocks of turned-in rental phones, AT&T later repainted and sold early-model non-LED Trimlines as [...] "non-lighted" [...] models, without a transformer.|$|R

Crabtree hears the car call his name in a woman's voice. The car {{turns out to be the}} reincarnation of his deceased mother, Gladys (voiced by Ann Sothern). She talks (only to Crabtree) through the car's radio: the <b>dial</b> <b>light</b> flashes in synchronization with [...] "Mother's" [...] voice. In an effort to get his family to accept the old, tired car, Crabtree brings it to a custom body shop for a full restoration. The car is coveted by a fanatical collector named Captain Manzini (Avery Schreiber), but Crabtree purchases and restores the car before Manzini can acquire it.|$|E
50|$|Many design tricks {{were used}} to reduce {{production}} costs of the five-tube radio. The heaters of all the vacuum tubes had to be rated {{to use the same}} current, so they could be operated in series from line voltage. The rectifier and audio output tube required more heater power, so dropped a larger voltage than the other tubes. In many designs the rectifier tube had a tap on the heater to power a <b>dial</b> <b>light.</b> The plate current was routed through that portion of the rectifier heater, in order {{to make up for the}} current diverted to the dial lamp. If the dial lamp failed, that part of the rectifier heater would have a larger current which could burn out the tube in a few months. Early radios had a resistor network to minimize the problem but this was soon eliminated as the cost of replacing the tube was not the manufacturer's problem. As with Christmas tree lights, if one tube heater failed, none of the tube heaters would operate.|$|E

50|$|The {{technical}} {{platform that}} made the Eco-Drive concept possible was the Eco-Drive caliber 7878 movement. This movement was the first light powered movement where the solar cells could be mounted under the <b>dial.</b> Previous <b>light</b> powered watches from Citizen and other manufacturers had the solar cell(s) mounted directly on the dial.This innovation was enabled by marked improvements in thin film amorphous silicon solar cells, which, by the early 1990s had become significantly more efficient. By locating a sufficiently translucent dial material over the now more efficient solar cells, enough light could pass through the dial face to power the movement. Though the Eco-Drive caliber 7878 movement solar cells remained slightly visible through the dial, the physical styling of the light-powered watch was no longer constrained by visible solar cells.|$|R

5000|$|It {{was also}} the last NHL arena to retain {{the use of an}} analog dial-type large four-sided clock for {{timekeeping}} in professional hockey games. Boston Garden and the Detroit Olympia (as well as the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium in its pre-NHL days) had identical scoreboards but replaced them with digital timers in the mid-1960s, with Boston having their digital four-sided clock in use for the 1969-70 NHL season. Built by Bulova as their [...] "Sports Timer", and installed in Chicago in 1943, each side of the clock had a large diameter 20-minute face in the center that kept the main game time for one period of ice hockey, with a set of shorter black-colored minute and longer red-colored sweep-second hands, and a pair of smaller, 5-minute capacity dual-concentric faces for penalty timekeeping, to the left and right of the primary 20-minute face — with each of the 5-minute penalty timers having its own single hand and each clock face, both the central main timer's dial and flanking penalty timer dials (when a penalty was counting down) illuminated from behind during gameplay. The [...] "outer" [...] face of each penalty timer had a single hand that avoided obscuration of the [...] "inner" [...] face and its own, [...] "solid" [...] single hand, through the use of metal rods forming the outer hand's [...] "shaft", holding its hand's [...] "pointer" [...] head — the set of two concentric faces for each penalty timer dial could handle two penalties for each set, with an illuminated [...] "2" [...] on each penalty timer <b>dial</b> <b>lighting</b> up to display a minor penalty infraction.

But the important thing to remember is that they all work. Part of Psionics is the art of Radionics which was discovered, or invented, by Dr. Albert Abrams {{in the early part of}} the last century. One day in 1910 he was in his office with a patient, percussing him which does not mean he was swearing at the man but rather tapping his tummy to see how his innards sounded. It's a doctor thing. Anyway, Doc Abrams got a kind of strange noise when the man faced one way but a normal noise when he faced another. So the good doctor spent the afternoon marching the man around the office, tapping his tummy while the waiting room outside was filled with fuming other patients waiting to get their tummies tapped...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays acutely ill {{patients}} are nursed {{in intensive care}} units which have become the status symbol of the modern hospital. These units sometimes provide treatment which is more “intensive” than it is “caring” because the need for personal involvement of the staff with the patient may be subjugated {{to the needs of}} the monitors, respirators and other gadgetry. An array of knobs, <b>dials</b> and flashing <b>lights</b> is usually displayed prominently to impress the visitor and ensure that the ward acquires the full prestige value which such equipment merits. The staff, who have a considerable ego-investment in this electric paraphernalia, derive much satisfaction from its operation even when it is recording the terminal paroxysms of a dying patient. There is still wide debate in the medical literature as to whether these units can justify, in terms of gainful lives saved, their enormously expensive equipment, staff and expertise. Be all that as it may, there is no doubt that the intensive care unit has come to stay and we must all learn to work in them and, in particular, help the patients who are being processed by them to maintain a healthy outlook. Such patients may be well looked after physically but are often silently suffering psychological torture...|$|R
5000|$|The {{advent of}} radio {{broadcasting}} increased {{the market for}} radio receivers greatly, and transformed them into a consumer product. At {{the beginning of the}} 1920s the radio receiver was a forbidding high-tech device, with many cryptic knobs and controls requiring technical skill to operate, housed in an unattractive black metal box, with a tinny-sounding horn loudspeaker. [...] By the 1930s, the broadcast receiver had become a piece of furniture, housed in an attractive wooden case, with standardized controls anyone could use, which occupied a respected place in the home living room. In the early radios the multiple tuned circuits required multiple knobs to be adjusted to tune in a new station. One of the most important ease-of-use innovations was [...] "single knob tuning", achieved by linking the tuning capacitors together mechanically. [...] The dynamic cone loudspeaker invented in 1924 greatly improved audio frequency response over the previous horn speakers, allowing music to be reproduced with good fidelity. Convenience features like large <b>lighted</b> <b>dials,</b> tone controls, pushbutton tuning, tuning indicators and automatic gain control (AGC) were added. [...] The receiver market was divided into the above broadcast receivers and communications receivers, which were used for two-way radio communications such as shortwave radio.|$|R
