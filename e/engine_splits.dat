50|$|Objectivity/DB is also {{different}} from RDBMSs {{in the way}} in which it handles queries. The application declares and initializes an iterator that locates and returns qualified objects as soon as they are located. The Objectivity/DB Parallel Query <b>Engine</b> <b>splits</b> queries into subtasks directed at individual databases or containers. Remote query agents service each subtask and return results to the iterator. The Parallel Query Engine has two replaceable components: a splitter that can determine how to best subdivide the task and a filter in the query agent that can further refine a query. A query involving cities in Europe might be split into forty nine subtasks, one for each country. The filter might access an external data source before qualifying or disqualifying the objects that the Query Agent has found in the Objectivity/DB database or container.|$|E

Nevertheless, this approach supposes that a search engine only uses cookies to identify users and {{does not take into}} consideration other elements such as the IP address, the HTTP header, or other fingerprints.

40|$|The high fuel {{efficiency}} and torque of the diesel engine {{has made it}} the obvious choice for heavy duty applications for a long time. In addition, these characteristics of the modern super-charged HSDI diesel engine also make it very suitable and popular for car applications. However, since all engines emit combustion products that can be harmful to the environment, and the transport sector makes a major contribution to total anthropogenic emissions of potentially harmful substances, increasing legislative demands are being placed on manufacturers of diesel (and other) engines to minimise emissions. One of several possible strategies to reduce pollutant formation is to use multiple injections, i. e. to divide injections into two or more parts. In the studies underlying this thesis the effects of multiple injections on diesel combustion were investigated experimentally, in both spray chamber experiments and engine tests. The main objectives of the work were to investigate ways in which multiple injections {{could be used to}} reduce engine-out emissions from diesel engines and to increase the efficiency of diesel <b>engines.</b> <b>Split</b> injections consisting of two injection pulses were shown to have significant effects on the combustion processes in both a heavy duty and a light duty engine, although the effects differed somewhat between the two types of engine. In the light duty <b>engine</b> <b>splitting</b> injections into two pulses lowered the engineout particulate and CO emissions and increased the {{fuel efficiency}}. However, they also resulted in increased NOX emissions. Increased air-fuel mixing {{is believed to be the}} main reason for this. In the heavy duty <b>engine</b> a <b>split</b> with a very short dwell time, resulting in a rate-shaped injection rather than a true split injection, resulted in shortened combustion durations, which simultaneously reduced fuel consumption and NOX emissions. Use of multiple injection regimes alone will not meet the tough emissions legislation of the future. However, they seem likely to play a significant role in the continuing efforts to develop cleaner diesel engines...|$|R

As far as cone angle is concerned the cone angle should be optimum and nozzle diameter should be optimized so as to achieve maximum efficiency for an optimum pressure. Even though EGR plays amajor role in reducing pollution levels to some extent in terms of NOx and soot, in this work EGR has been considered as zero percentage because as EGR increases particulate matter.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effects of split injection on emission formation and engine performance,experiments was carried out using a heavy duty single cylinder Diesel <b>engine.</b> <b>Split</b> injections with varied dwell Time and start of injection were investigated and compared with single injection cases.

The engine was equipped with a common rail injection system with a piezoelectric injector. To interpret the observed phenomena,engine CFD simulations using the KIVA- 3 V code were also made. The results show that a reduction in NOx emissions and brake specific fuel consumption was achieved for short dwell times whereas they were increased when the dwell time was prolonged. No EGR was used so the soot levels were already very low in the cases of sinGle injections. The results indicated,however,no increase in soot as a result of splitting the injection in two parts. Both HC and CO emissions were found to increase with split injections...|$|R
