40|$|Abstract. Justification Logic studies epistemic and provability {{phenomena}} {{by introducing}} justifications/proofs into {{the language in}} the form of justification terms. Pure justification logics serve as counterparts of traditional modal epistemic logics, and hybrid logics combine epistemic modalities with justification terms. The computational complexity of pure justification logics is typically lower than that of the corresponding modal logics. Moreover, the so-called reflected fragments, which still contain complete information about the respective justification logics, are known to be in NP {{for a wide range of}} justification logics, pure and hybrid alike. This paper shows that, under reasonable additional restrictions, these reflected fragments are NP-complete, thereby proving a matching lower bound. 1 Introduction and Main <b>Definitions</b> <b>Justification</b> Logic is an emerging field that studies provability, knowledge, and belief via explicit proofs or justifications that are part of the language.

Weekly meetings were performed to review each complication enabling an action plan to be created to prevent future recurrence. Rates were compared with previously audited and published results, using the chi-square test. A total of 326 procedures were performed over the six months including 30 pancreatectomies, 45 liver resections and 251 other procedures. 37 patients developed complications (11. 3 %) with 47 complications in total including two deaths. Using the ISGPS grading, eight complications were identified; two grade A, four grade B and two grade C. There were three grade A ISGLS complications and one grade B. 30 complications were justified as unavoidable, 16 as avoidable and one as indeterminate. Action plans included continued monitoring (n= 41), formulation of new policy (n= 3), individual counselling (n= 4), educational offering (n= 4).

This study addresses this issue by examining the views of senior personal across both the client and agency sides of the industry. These views are obtained by analysing quantitative and qualitative feedback from an online questionnaire.

The method is innovating by providing decision based on qualitative multicriteria and systemic modelling; this, in a stage of the project where information level is at a minimum and action margin at a maximum. Albatros D emphasizes two crucial aspects of the diagnosis: the <b>definition</b> and <b>justification</b> of the needs and the formalization of the stakes of the project. It is intended to be participative, by trying to integrate most of concerned stakeholders: building owner, residents, policy makers and experts. We particularly distinguish two components of the diagnosis: the use of indicators for the current state assessment of an urban system in regard to evaluation objectives (appraisal) and the identification of causal relations between indicators for the comprehension of how the system is working. The article presents the case of a real property foundation having several sets totalizing about 500 residences. They are spatially located close to each other at the periphery of the city of Geneva. The social and urban context is ill-defined and complex. The housing is degraded, but nevertheless it shows some architectural qualities.

When others speak of &dquo;government officials,&dquo; &dquo;bureaucrats,&dquo; and &dquo;poli-cymakers,&dquo; it is more likely than not they are referring to people who have some training in planning. Planners often deal with complex and controversial issues, especially as they relate to land.

We begin with a <b>definition,</b> a <b>justification,</b> and a brief history of American planning. We then describe some of the traditional equi-table concerns of the planning profession. These have always been major concerns for planners. The Planner’s Code of Ethics contains one of the strongest affirmations of redistribution of any profession. The housing and community development area of planning has focused on issues of equity, whereas traditional environmental planning has not. At this point it will become apparent that a schism exists between these two major planning areas. We will discuss the reasons for this.

The first chapter also makes a brief survey of the context for migrant writing within New Zealand literature, and compares the work of several short story writers, migrant and non-migrant. The work of two New Zealand migrant short story writers is discussed closely in the chapters that follow: Amelia Batistich's stories are examined in Chapter Two, and Yvonne du Fresne's in Chapter Three. In each discussion, formal qualities are given equal attention as matters of content and theme. The final chapter attempts to draw connections between the work of these two writers and the problems of definition raised in the first chapter. Consideration is also given to the attitudes and expectations of readers of migrant fiction. The appendices to the thesis contain biographies of Amelia Batistich and Yvonne du Fresne, and transcripts of conversations with them. The conversations were recorded in 1984, and have been lightly edited.
