50|$|For medical purposes, X-ray {{filters are}} used to {{selectively}} attenuate, or block out, low-energy rays during x-ray imaging (radiography). Low energy x-rays (less than 30 keV) contribute little to the resultant image as they are heavily absorbed by the patient's soft tissues (particularly the skin). Additionally, this absorption adds {{to the risk of}} stochastic (e.g. cancer) or non stochastic radiation effects (e.g. tissue reactions) in the patient. Thus, it is favorable to remove these low energy X-rays from the incident light beam. X-ray filtration may be inherent due to the X-ray tube and housing material itself or added from additional sheets of filter material. The minimum filtration used is usually 2.5 mm aluminium (Al) equivalent, although there is an increasing trend to use greater filtration. Manufacturers of modern <b>fluoroscopy</b> <b>equipment</b> utilize a system of adding a variable thickness of copper (Cu) filtration according to patient thickness. This typically ranges from 0.1 to 0.9 mm Cu.|$|E

30|$|The {{growing number}} of {{indications}} for ERCP encompass retained or recurrent choledocholithiasis, benign and malignant biliary strictures, ampullary stenosis, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD), postoperative and traumatic ductal injuries, acute gallstone and chronic pancreatitis. Widely considered a safe procedure that often obviates the need for surgery (particularly in frail patients with poor performance status), ERCP has limited contraindications such as upper aerodigestive obstruction, severe coagulopathy, oesophageal and/or gastric varices, anaphylactic reaction to iodinated contrast medium (CM), acute nonbiliary pancreatitis, severe cardiopulmonary impairment and recent myocardial infarction.

40|$|Abstract A {{selective}} lumbosacral {{nerve root}} block is generally is performed under X-ray fluoroscopy, {{which has the}} disadvantage of radiation exposure {{and the need for}} <b>fluoroscopy</b> <b>equipment.</b> In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of ultrasound and nerve stimulation-guided S 1 nerve root block on 37 patients with S 1 radicular syn-drome. With the patient in a prone position, an ultrasound scan was performed by placing the probe parallel to the body axis. The needle was pointed slightly medial from the lateral side of the probe and advanced toward a hyper-echoic area in the sacral foramina with ultrasound guid-ance. Contrast medium was then injected and its dispersion confirmed by fluoroscopy. The acquired contrast images were classified into intraneural, perineural, and paraneural patterns. The significance of differences in the effect of the block among the contrast image patterns was analyzed. After nerve block, decreased sensation at the S 1 innervated region and pain relief was achieved in all patients. No significant difference was noted in the effect of the block between perineural and paraneural patterns. In conclusion, this technique provided reliable S 1 nerve root block in patients with S 1 radicular syndrome and minimized radi-ation exposure...|$|E

40|$|Background: While {{traditional}} intraoperative fluoroscopy protection {{relies on}} thyroid shields and aprons, recent {{data suggest that}} the surgeon’s eyes and hands receive more exposure than previously appreciated. Using a distal radial fracture surgery model, we examined (1) radiation exposure to the eyes, thyroid, chest, groin, and hands of a surgeon mannequin; (2) the degree to which shielding equipment can decrease exposure; and (3) how exposure varies with fluoroscopy unit size. Methods: An anthropomorphic model was fit with radiation-attenuating glasses, a thyroid shield, an apron, and gloves. “Exposed ” thermoluminescent dosimeters overlaid the protective equipment at the eyes, thyroid, chest, groin, and index finger while “shielded ” dosimeters were placed beneath the protective <b>equipment.</b> <b>Fluoroscopy</b> position and settings were standardized. The mini-c-armmilliampere-seconds were fixed based on the selection of the kilovolt peak (kVp). Three mini and three standard c-arms scanned a model of the patient’s wrist continuously for fifteen minutes each. Ten dosimeter exposures were recorded for each c-arm. Results: Hand exposure averaged 31 mSv/min (range, 22 to 48 mSv/min), which was 13. 0 times higher than the other recorded exposures. Eye exposure averaged 4 mSv/min, 2. 2 times higher than the mean thyroid, chest, and groin exposure. Gloves reduced hand exposure by 69. 4 %. Glasses decreased eye exposure by 65. 6 %.

40|$|Most {{radiology}} {{departments of}} Dutch hospitals hold unused possibilities for lowering the radiation dose to children. This {{was found in}} an investigation commissioned to the RIVM by the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate. Since children are {{more sensitive to the}} long-term harmful effects of ionizing radiation than adults, it is important to give radiation dose in children due attention. Radiographic imaging for children requires a lower dose than for adults. When x-ray equipment optimized for adults is used for children, they receive a higher dose. The average required dose can be reduced further by using dedicated protocols. d dedicated protocols for paediatric CT and fluoroscopy to often be missing. In some cases, obsolete <b>fluoroscopy</b> <b>equipment</b> is employed. On the other hand, the CT-scanners used are relatively modern.

There is a direct relation between patient dose and the absorbed dose to the personnel since this is mostly due to scattered radiation from the patient. If the correct methodology and the correct radiation protection devices are used, the absorbed dose to the personnel could be minimised to acceptable levels even for those working with complex procedures.

40|$|Background. Cryobiopsy {{is used to}} biopsy {{peripheral}} lung lesions through flexible bronchoscopy with fluoroscopic guidance. However, fluoroscopy is {{not available}} at some institutions. This study evaluated the feasibility of radial endobronchial ultrasound-guided bronchoscopic cryobiopsy without fluoroscopy. Methods. This retrospective study was conducted at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou branch, in Taiwan. This study enrolled patients who received bronchoscopy examinations with cryotechnology between July 2014 and June 2016. The data were collected through medical chart review. Results. During the study period, 101 patients underwent bronchoscopy examinations with cryotechnology. Ninety patients with endobronchial tumors were excluded from this study. Eleven patients who underwent radial endobronchial ultrasound-guided bronchoscopic cryobiopsy for lung parenchymal lesions were enrolled into this study. The mean age was 61. 1 [*]±[*] 13. 8 years. Five patients were men, and the other six were women. The number of cryobiopsies ranged from 1 to 3.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveThis study {{evaluated}} the longitudinal {{performance of a}} modified Lyon schuss (LS) knee examination in the detection of radiographic joint space narrowing (JSN) in knees with osteoarthritis (OA). The modified LS exam entails two to four iterative acquisitions with empirically adjusted angulation of the X-ray beam to achieve superimposition of the anterior and posterior margins of the medial tibial plateau (MTP), a marker of parallel radioanatomic alignment that the original LS exam achieves with fluoroscopically guided beam angulation. MethodsSeventy-four obese women with symptomatic knee OA underwent LS and fixed-flexion (FF, caudal 10 ° beam angulation) X-ray exams at baseline and 1 year later. For 47 subjects, beam angulation for both LS exams was guided by fluoroscopy. For 27 subjects, the modified LS exam was performed at one or both times. Modified and original LS procedures were evaluated relative to concurrent FF radiographs {{with respect to the}} inter-margin distance (IMD) at the MTP midpoint (quality and reproducibility of alignment) and sensitivity to JSN. ResultsCompared to FF radiographs, modified LS radiographs afforded a smaller mean IMD at baseline (0. 89 vs 2. 06 mm, P= 0. 002), more reproducible IMD (mean change= 0. 49 vs 0. 91 mm, P= 0. 007) and more rapid JSN (mean= 0. 25 vs 0. 02 mm/yr, P= 0. 005). These differences paralleled those observed between original LS and FF procedures with respect to baseline alignment (0. 96 vs 1. 94 mm, P< 0. 001), reproducibility of alignment (0. 49 vs 1. 00 mm, P< 0. 001) and sensitivity to JSN (0. 16 vs − 0. 01 mm/yr, P= 0. 007). ConclusionIn clinical centers where the absence of <b>fluoroscopy</b> <b>equipment</b> precludes use of the original LS protocol, a modified procedure employing iterative, empirical adjustment of the beam angle to achieve parallel radioanatomic alignment with the MTP affords a degree of superiority over the FF protocol with respect to quality and reproducibility of positioning and sensitivity to JSN in OA knees {{similar to that of the}} original...|$|E

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award {{of the degree of}} Master of Technology Radiography (Diagnostic) in the Faculty of Health and Wellness Sciences at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2009 Since their discovery in 1895, the use of x-rays is continuously evolving in medicine making the diagnosis of injuries and diseases more practicable. It is therefore not surprising that x-rays contribute 90 % of the radiation dose to the population from manmade sources (DWP, 1992). Moreover, these radiation doses are associated with both fatal and non-fatal cancer risk that is detrimental to adults between 20 to 60 years (Wall, 1996). Radiation dose to individuals therefore needs to be actively monitored in order to minimise such risk. Barium contrast examinations were characterised as one of the radiological examinations that contributed enormously to the collective dose to the patients in the radiology department (DWP, 1992). Determining the diagnostic reference levels of such examinations would reduce the over-exposure of individuals to ionising radiation. Currently in South Africa (SA), there are no diagnostic dose reference levels for barium meal (BaM) and barium enema (BaE) examinations. This study therefore investigated the radiation doses delivered to patients referred for BaM and BaE, obtained potential regional reference doses for these examinations, compared the radiation doses obtained with those from similar dosimetry studies and investigated sources of dose variation among the study sites. A total of 25 BaM and 30 BaE patients in the age range 18 to 85 years, weighing 50 kg to 90 kg, at 3 hospitals in the Western Cape, SA were investigated. The radiation dose to the patients was measured using Dose Area Product (DAP) meters that were permanently fitted onto fixed fluoroscopy units at these 3 hospitals. The third quartile DAP values were 20. 1 Gycm 2 and 36. 5 Gycm 2 for BaM and BaE respectively. The median DAP values were 13. 6 Gycm 2 and 27. 8 Gycm 2 for BaM and BaE respectively. The median values were recommended as the potential Diagnostic Reference Levels for BaM and BaE as they are less affected by outlying values of under or over- weight (Yakoumakis, Tsalafoutas, Sandilos, Koulentianos et al, 1999). The weights of the patients, fluoroscopy time, the number of images obtained, the use of digital or conventional <b>fluoroscopy</b> <b>equipment</b> and the level of training of the radiologists were the factors considered for dose variation among the 3 hospitals...|$|E
