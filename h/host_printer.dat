50|$|Provides {{the student}} with skills and {{knowledge}} necessary to implement standard Solaris features to set file and directory permissions, add/delete user’s, groups, <b>host,</b> and <b>printers,</b> configure a Solaris Network, and manage multiple tasks on a Solaris-based system.|$|R
2500|$|USB {{support and}} {{redirection}} – connect peripherals such as flash drives and digital cameras, and print from the guest to <b>host</b> OS <b>printers.</b> However, USB isochronous transfer mode is not supported [...] Other methods involve simply just treating an active drive {{letter from a}} USB flash drive as a virtual hard drive.|$|R
25|$|Printer sharing: Guest {{operating}} systems may {{print on the}} <b>host</b> operating system's <b>printer.</b> This feature {{should not be confused}} with File and Printer Sharing over an emulated network connection.|$|R
50|$|A {{managed device}} is a network node that {{implements}} an SNMP interface that allows unidirectional (read-only) or bidirectional (read and write) access to node-specific information. Managed devices exchange node-specific {{information with the}} NMSs. Sometimes called network elements, the managed devices can be any type of device, including, but not limited to, routers, access servers, switches, cable modems, bridges, hubs, IP telephones, IP video cameras, computer <b>hosts,</b> and <b>printers.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{connection}} (interface) to the <b>host</b> computer. Many <b>printers</b> {{communicate by}} wi-fi. Other popular interfaces are USB and Ethernet. Many older printers {{also have a}} parallel (Centronix) interface. High-end printers often have a channel interface for direct connection to a mainframe computer.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} building, on {{the corner}} of Rue Sainte-Anne and des Jardins, was a house built in 1858 and designed by Charles Baillairgé. It was built as a four-storey house, and was almost immediately sold to Queen's Printers George-Édouard Desbarats and Stewart Derbishire. The building <b>hosted</b> the <b>printers</b> (and various smaller businesses) until 1870, when it became the Russel House hotel, which was sold in 1894, and renamed the Clarendon Hotel. The hotel changed hands again several times until it became part of the Dufour Group hotels.|$|R

The process of administering all these systems [...] desktops and servers alike [...] are relatively straight-forward in a homogeneous environment, {{but what happens when}} OS X is introduced to the enterprise {{in the form of a}} sleek, shiny new MacBook Air or iMac? The objective of this paper is to provide the solution of this question. Supporting Mac users can be a challenge to systems administrators in a Windows Active Directory environment. Although Apple has used Samba to make it easy for Macs to browse and access shares and <b>printers</b> <b>hosted</b> by Windows servers using Microsoft's server message block (SMB) protocol, true Active Directory integration requires more than just access to resources. The objective of this project is to provide a way to integrate Mac devices with Windows Server Active Directory. Although Apple has provided way to bind Mac with AD but this project would also take this integration to next level by considering other options available to integrate Mac with directory services...|$|R
50|$|NetBIOS on Windows and its sibling SMB {{on other}} {{operating}} systems, supports individual hosts {{on the network}} to advertise services, such as file shares and printers. It also supports for example a network printer to advertise itself as a <b>host</b> sharing a <b>printer</b> device and any related services it supports. Depending on how a device is attached (to the network directly, or to the host which shares it) and which protocols are supported however, Windows clients connecting to it may prefer to use SSDP or WSD over using NetBIOS. NetBIOS {{is one of the}} providers on Windows implementing the more general discovery process dubbed 'Function Discovery' which includes built-in providers for PnP, Registry, NetBIOS, SSDP and WSD of which the former two are local-only and the latter three support discovery of networked devices. None of these need any configuration for use on the local subnet. NetBIOS has traditionally been supported only in expensive printers for use in companies and the cheapest devices of some brands today still don't have support for it, but home and SOHO users would connect printers to a computer over say a parallel port or USB and share it from the computer. However, today even entry-level printers with Wi-Fi or Ethernet support of some brands support it natively, allowing the printer to be used without configuration even on very old operating systems (combined with a generic PostScript driver, for example).|$|R
