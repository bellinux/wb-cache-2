This prediction is further exploited to improve the estimation of the total feet state by fusing it with inertial and force/torque measurements in an Extended Kalman Filter. This multimodal sensor fusion is relevant when implementing whole-body controllers for robots in non-rigid non-coplanar contacts. I...|$|E

This, however, should come at no surprise as the KF has an explicit dynamics model (e.g. static position model for non-inertial approach) which fits nicely to the scenario {{and the results}} could be worse when the KF process model does not match the true object dynamics. This is, fortunately, {{not a problem for}} the second system (see Scenario 2 below) where the inertial sensors are employed within the prediction step using the methods of strapdown inertial mechanization. In this case the process dynamics is based not on the assumptions on expected motion models (as in Scenario 1), but on a true dynamics provided by a direct integration using the inertial sensors and, therefore, is able to capture all the details of the corresponding motion.

We have previously developed a wearable location system that combines a foot-mounted <b>inertial</b> <b>unit,</b> a detailed building model and a particle filter to locate and track humans in indoor environments. In this paper we present an algorithm in which a map of radio beacon signal strengths is used to solve two of the major problems with the original system: scalability to large environments and uncertainty due to environmental symmetry. We show that the algorithm allows the deployment of the system in arbitrarily large buildings, and that uncertainty due to environmental symmetry is reduced. This reduction allows a user to be located after taking an average of 38 steps in a 8725 m 2 three-storey building, compared with 76 steps in the original system. Finally, we show that radio maps such as those required by the algorithm can be generated quickly and automatically using the wearable location system itself.

We collect static data under different temperature points using a MEMS-based inertial sensor mounted inside a thermal chamber. Rigorous stochastic models, namely Autoregressive-based Gauss-Markov (AR-based GM) models are developed to describe the random error behaviour. The proposed AR-based GM model is initially applied to short stationary inertial data to develop the stochastic model parameters (correlation times). It is shown that the stochastic model parameters of a MEMS-based <b>inertial</b> <b>unit,</b> namely the ADIS 16364, are temperature dependent. In addition, field kinematic test data collected at about 17 °C are used to test the performance of the stochastic models at different temperature points in the filtering stage using Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). It is shown that the stochastic model developed at 20 °C provides a more accurate inertial navigation solution than the ones obtained from the stochastic models developed at − 40 °C, − 20 °C, 0 °C, + 40 °C, and + 60 °C.
