40|$|There is a {{trend in}} Thailand {{for the design of}} {{dwellings}} {{to move away from the}} traditional, climate responsive architecture towards a style influenced by western architecture. This trend means that buildings are less able to control the internal environment to comfortable conditions without mechanical air conditioning. One technique for reducing the scale of air conditioning is to apply thermal insulation in walls and roofs. This project is exploring the potential for using agricultural waste as the material for this thermal insulation, a solution which offers a reduction in resource use in addition to reducing energy consumed by air conditioning, similar to the use in the UK of sheep fleece as a thermal insulation to reduce heat loss. The criteria evaluated include the availability of agricultural waste materials, their physical properties when transformed into a useable product, methods of production and their environmental impacts. There are several possible materials including bagasse (the waste from sugarcane production), rice hulls, coconut <b>husk,</b> <b>corn</b> stalk, durian peel, and palm oil leaves.

30|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that the bioconversion of crop residues like straw, <b>husk,</b> <b>corn</b> cobs, bagasse and vegetative materials coming from regularly grown field crops can be converted into raw compost using windrows at farmer’s fields (Singh and Prabha 2017). The raw compost was further fortified with the plant growth promoting microorganisms or biocontrol agents like Trichoderma and Pseudomonas to scale up the efficiency of microbial formulations (Galitskaya et al. 2016). The strength of raw compost can also be improved {{by the addition of}} poultry wastes and degradation with the help of microbial enzymes (Brandelli et al. 2015). In the very simple steps, bioconversion processes of agricultural wastes can be disseminated among rural population for adoption of such microbe-based models of bio-business. The impact of pelletizing pressure for developing solid state compost from different composting materials like pig solid fraction, bulking agents, e.g., biochar and wood chips, swine manure solid fractions and organic co-formulates was assessed for standardizing physical and mechanical properties of the composted material (Romano et al. 2014; Pampuro et al. 2017 a, b). These studies resulted in developing farmer-friendly and easily adaptable composted products with quality standards for commercialization and enterprising. These models are supposed to be developed for introducing multi-enterprising support for smart agriculture system (Pramanik et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to utilize rice husk and corn cob and skin to produce biobricket as an {{alternative}} to kerosene and gas through examination of caloric value and ash content of the rice <b>husk,</b> <b>corn</b> cob, corn skin and biobricket combustion characteristics. The study used an experimental method to reexamine the quality of biobricket in laboratory and field. The former started with charcoal furnace preparation and rendement calculation of the rice husk and corn skin charcoal produced. The charcoal quality test was examined through caloric and ash level valuation. The biobricket quality was based upon size variations, 15 mesh, 20 mesh, 25 mesh, 30 mesh and pressure through compression process using a hydrolic pump of 5000 kg/m 2. The rice husk and corn skin was collected from North Minahasa Regency. Variables observed in the study were charcoaling process using a furnace covering rendement output (%). charcoaling duration (minute), maximum charcoal temperature (oC), and caloric value (cal/g) and ash content (%) of the charcoal tested in the laboratory of Research and Industrial Standardization Board, Manado. The biobricket quality characteristic obtained was boiling time. The highest water boiling time occurred in 15 mesh size in 27 minutes, maximum temperature under the pan, 383 oC in 30 mesh, duration of 562 minutes of biobricket charcoal burnt out in 30 mesh and the best (least) ash combustion remain of the biobricket charcoal of 12. 48 % in treatment 15 mesh. The agricultural wastes, as rice husk and corn skin, could be produced as environmental friendly biobricket with the best treatment of 15 mesh size that resulted in the highest boiling duration and the least ash residue, and the treatment of 30 mesh size gave maximum temperature under the pan and the longest time of burnt out biobricket charcoal...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to remove five different direct dyes (Direct Violet 51, Indosol Turquoise FBL, Indosol Black NF, Indosol Yellow BG and Indosol Orange RSN) from aqueous solutions by using agro-industrial waste materials (sugarcane bagasse, peanut <b>husk,</b> <b>corn</b> cobs, cotton sticks and sunflower) in batch and column mode. The batch mode study was performed to compare the biosorption potential of native, pretreated and immobilized forms of biosorbents for the removal of direct dyes. Important process parameters like pH, contact time, biosorbent dose, initial dye concentration and temperature were optimized during batch experiments. The results revealed that low pH, low biosorbent dose and low temperature were the feasible conditions for maximum removal of dyes. The pretreated form of biosorbents depicted highest biosorption capacity (39. 6 mg/g for Direct Violet 51, 65. 09 mg/g for Indosol Turquoise FBL, 89. 6 mg/g for Indosol Black NF, 79. 5 mg/g for Indosol Yellow BG and 79. 7 mg/g for Indosol Orange RSN) as compare to native and immobilized form of biosorbents. The experimental data of all the five dyes was subjected to different kinetic models and pseudo-second order kinetic model was found to be best fit on the experimental results. Different equilibrium isotherms were applied on the data to explain the mechanism of biosorption and Langmuir adsorption isotherm model fitted very well on the experimental results for all the dyes. Thermodynamic study showed that biosorption process was feasible at lower temperatures as indicated by lower values of ΔG. The negative values of ΔH indicated that biosorption process was exothermic in nature. The column mode experiments were conducted to optimize the bed height, flow rate and initial dye concentration. Higher bed heights, lower flow rates and higher initial dye concentrations were found to be favorable conditions for maximum dye removal in column mode study. Box-Behnken experimental design was used to investigate the main and interaction effects of three important parameters like initial dye concentration, biosorbent dose and pH on the removal of direct dyes and results were analyzed by ANOVA and p-values. The biosorption process was also applied on the real textile effluents for the efficient removal of COD. Characterization of biosorbents was carried out by FT-IR and SEM analysis. The results revealed that agricultural waste materials have high biosorption capacities for the removal of dyes from wastewaters...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Corn</b> <b>husks</b> are {{the major}} wastes of corn {{industries}} with meagre economic significance. The present study was planned for value addition of <b>corn</b> <b>husk</b> through extraction of xylan, followed by its enzymatic hydrolysis into xylooligosaccharides, a pentose based prebiotic. Compositional analysis of <b>corn</b> <b>husks</b> revealed neutral detergent fibre 68. 87 %, acid detergent fibre 31. 48 %, hemicelluloses 37. 39 %, cellulose 29. 07 % and crude protein 2. 68 %. Irrespective of the extraction conditions, sodium hydroxide {{was found to be}} more effective in maximizing the yield of xylan from <b>corn</b> <b>husks</b> than potassium hydroxide (84 % vs. 66 %). Application of xylanase over the xylan of <b>corn</b> <b>husks</b> resulted into production of xylooligosaccharides with different degree of polymerization namely, xylobiose and xylotriose in addition to xylose monomer. On the basis of response surface model analysis, the maximum yield of xylobiose (1. 9 mg/ml) was achieved with the enzymatic hydrolysis conditions of pH 5. 8, temperature 44 °C, enzyme dose 5. 7 U/ml and hydrolysis time of 17. 5 h.
