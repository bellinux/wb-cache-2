60|$|Run {{away on the}} 10th of September past, from William Dewees of Germantown Township, in Philadelphia County, a Servant Man named Mekbizedarh Arnold, of {{a middle}} Stature and reddish curled Hair: He had on when he went away, a good Felt Hat, a dark Cinnamon-colour'd Coat, black <b>Drugget</b> Jacket, mouse-colour'd <b>drugget</b> Breeches, grey Stockings, and new Shoes.|$|E
6000|$|... [43] Shadwell makes Dryden say, {{that after}} some years {{spent at the}} university, he came to London. [...] "At first I {{struggled}} {{with a great deal}} of persecution, took up with a lodging which had a window no bigger than a pocket looking-glass, dined at a three-penny ordinary enough to starve a vacation tailor, kept little company, went clad in homely <b>drugget,</b> and drunk wine as seldom as a rechabite, or the grand seignior's confessor." [...] The old gentleman, who corresponded with the [...] "Gentleman's Magazine," [...] and remembered Dryden before the rise of his fortunes, mentions his suit of plain <b>drugget,</b> being, by the bye, the same garb in which he has clothed Flecnoe, who [...] "coarsely clad in Norwich <b>drugget</b> came." ...|$|E
60|$|It is stylish to have hair ribbons {{to match}} your dress. But {{it is hard}} to match gray <b>drugget.</b> I like scarlet for that.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh no, papa," [...] said Jane innocently; [...] "there {{are very}} pretty <b>druggets</b> now for {{covering}} stair carpets, {{so that they}} can be used without hurting them." ...|$|R
60|$|Western goods {{had their}} share here also, and several booths were filled as full with serges, duroys, <b>druggets,</b> shalloons, cantaloons, Devonshire kerseys, etc., from Exeter, Taunton, Bristol, {{and other parts}} west, and some from London also.|$|R
60|$|Down {{the scarlet}} <b>drugget</b> they went--the big best {{man with the}} red hands and the {{lavender}} kid gloves and the opulent-looking old gentleman with the gold-rimmed spectacles and the handsome walking stick.|$|E
6000|$|With {{his heart}} {{so full of}} glee, sir, [...] And his pockets full of gold, [...] And his bag of <b>drugget,</b> with many a nugget, [...] As heavy as he could hold.' ...|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} the old frontiersman {{pointed to a}} rocky shelf whereon rested the five half-kegs, covered {{with a piece of}} heavy <b>drugget,</b> often used in colonial days in place of rubber cloth.|$|E
60|$|Basingstoke {{is a large}} populous market-town, has a good {{market for}} corn, and lately within a very few years is fallen into a manufacture, viz., of making <b>druggets</b> and shalloons, and such slight goods, which, however, employs {{a good number of}} the poor people, and enables them to get their bread, which knew not how to get it before.|$|R
60|$|As {{the city}} of Winchester is a city without trade--that is to say, without any {{particular}} manufactures--so this city of Salisbury and all the county of Wilts, {{of which it is}} the capital, are full of a great variety of manufactures, and those some of the most considerable in England--namely, the clothing trade and the trade of flannels, <b>druggets,</b> and several other sorts of manufactures, of which in their order.|$|R
6000|$|The {{broad-cloth}} and <b>druggets</b> in Wilts, Gloucester, and Worcestershire; serges in Devon and Somersetshire; narrow-cloths in Yorkshire and Staffordshire; kerseys, cottons, half-thicks, duffields, plains, and coarser things, in Lancashire and Westmoreland; shalloons in {{the counties}} of Northampton, Berks, Oxford, Southampton, and York; women's-stuffs in Norfolk; linsey-woolseys, &c, at Kidderminster; dimmeties and cotton-wares at Manchester; flannels at Salisbury, and in Wales; tammeys at Coventry; and the like. It is the same, in some respects, with our provisions, especially for the supply {{of the city of}} London, and also of several other parts: for example, when I speak of provisions, I mean such as are not made use of in the county where they are made and produced. For example: ...|$|R
60|$|There {{were one}} or two chairs placed behind a red <b>drugget</b> curtain, where adventurous spirits led their {{partners}} later in the evening. They found a place there, {{and the young man}} recovered his power of speech.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quick, Watson, quick! Get it back again!" [...] The wooden lid was replaced, and the <b>drugget</b> {{had only}} just been drawn {{straight}} when Lestrade's voice was heard in the passage. He found Holmes leaning languidly against the mantelpiece, resigned and patient, endeavouring to conceal his irrepressible yawns.|$|E
6000|$|He said; but {{his last}} words were {{scarcely}} heard: [...] For Bruce and Longville[160] had a trap prepared, [...] And down they sent the yet declaiming bard. [...] Sinking he left his <b>drugget</b> robe behind, [...] Borne upwards by a subterranean wind. [...] The mantle fell to the young prophet's part, [...] With double portion of his father's art.|$|E
60|$|This {{carriage}} is {{the medium}} of our inland trade, and, as I said, is {{a branch of the}} trade itself. This great carriage is occasioned by the situation of our produce and manufactures. For example--the Taunton and Exeter serges, perpetuanas, and duroys, come chiefly by land; the clothing, such as the broad-cloth and <b>druggets</b> from Wilts, Gloucester, Worcester, and Shropshire, comes all by land-carriage to London, and goes down again by land-carriages to all parts of England; the Yorkshire clothing trade, the Manchester and Coventry trades, all by land, not to London only, but to all parts of England, by horse-packs--the Manchester men being, saving their wealth, a kind of pedlars, who carry their goods themselves to the country shopkeepers every where, as do now the Yorkshire and Coventry manufacturers also.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{though this}} made our traffick {{impracticable}} at Lima itself, yet it did {{by no means}} hinder the merchants trading with us under cover, &c., but especially {{when they came to}} understand that we were not loaden from Europe with baize, long ells, <b>druggets,</b> broadcloth, serges, stuffs, stockings, hats, and such like woollen manufactures of France, England, &c.; but that our cargo was the same with that of the Manilla ships at Acapulca, and that we were loaden with calicoes, muslins, fine-wrought China silks, damasks, Japan wares, China wares, spices, &c., there was then no withholding them: but they came on board us in the night with canoes, and, staying all day, went on shore again in the night, carrying their goods to different places, where they knew they could convey them on shore without difficulty.|$|R
60|$|The cloths, stuffs, serges, <b>druggets,</b> &c, {{which are}} brought to market {{in the west and}} {{northern}} parts of England, and in Norfolk, as they are bought without the dressing and making up, it may be said of them that they {{are brought to}} market unfinished, and they are bought there again by the wholesale dealers, or cloth-workers, tuckers, and merchants, and they carry them to their warehouses and workhouses, and there they go through divers operations again, and are finished for the market; nor, indeed, are they fit to be shown till they are so; the stuffs are in the grease, the cloth is in the oil, they are rough and foul, and are not dressed, and consequently not finished; and as our buyers do not understand them till they are so dressed, it is no proper finishing the goods to bring them to market before--they are not, indeed, properly said to be made till that part is done.|$|R
60|$|We gave them, however, a good {{large pack}} of European goods, to make {{agreeable}} presents where they received favours; such as black baize, pieces of say, serge, calamanco, <b>drugget,</b> hats and stockings; not forgetting another pack of hatchets, knives, scissors, beads, toys, and such things, {{to please the}} natives of the plain country, if they should meet with any.|$|E
60|$|When Eric {{returned}} to the house with an armful of the long stemmed, white Madonna lilies that bloomed in the orchard Kilmeny was just coming down the steep, narrow staircase with its striped carpeting of homespun <b>drugget.</b> Her marvelous loveliness was brought out into brilliant relief by the dark wood work and shadows of the dim old hall.|$|E
60|$|Run {{away on the}} 25th of September past, from Rice Prichard of Whiteland in Chester County, a Servant Man named John Cresswel, of {{a middle}} Stature and ruddy Countenance, his Hair inclining to Red: He had on when he went away, a little white short Wig, an old Hat, <b>Drugget</b> Wastcoat, the Body lined with Linnen; coarse Linnen Breeches, grey woollen Stockings, and round toe'd Shoes.|$|E
60|$|Our {{ship was}} now an open fair; for, {{two or three}} days after, came the vessel back which went away in the night, and with them a Chinese junk, and seven or eight Chinese or Japanners; strange, ugly, ill-looking fellows they were, but brought a Spaniard to be their interpreter, and they came to trade also, {{bringing}} with them seventy great chests of China ware exceeding fine, twelve chests of China silks of several sorts, and some lackered cabinets, very fine. We dealt with them for all those, for our supercargo left nothing, he took everything they brought. Our traders were more difficult to please than we: for as for baize and <b>druggets,</b> and such goods, they would not meddle with them; but our fine cloths and some bales of linen they bought very freely. So we unloaded their vessel and put our goods on board. We took a good sum of money of them besides; but whither they went we knew not, for they both came and went in the night too, as the other did.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sir--The goods {{you sent}} me last week {{are not at}} all for my purpose, being of a sort which I am at present full of: however, if you are willing they should lie here, I will take all {{opportunities}} to sell them for your account; otherwise, on your first orders, they shall be delivered to whoever you shall direct: and as you had no orders from me for such sorts of goods, you cannot take this ill. But I have here enclosed sent you five patterns as under, marked 1 to 5; if you think fit to make me fifty pieces of <b>druggets</b> of the same weight and goodness with the fifty pieces, No. A.B., which I had from you last October, and mixed as exactly as you can to the enclosed patterns, ten to each pattern, and can have the same to be delivered here any time in February next, I shall take them at the same price which I gave you for the last; and one month after the delivery you may draw upon me for the money, which shall be paid to your content. Your friend and servant.|$|R

60|$|We made {{it appear}} as if this answer was satisfactory; {{and the next morning}} Captain Merlotte sent his boat on shore with all French sailors and a French midshipman, with a {{handsome}} present to the governor, consisting of some bottles of French wines, some brandy, two pieces of fine Holland, two pieces of English black baize, one piece of fine French <b>drugget,</b> and five yards of scarlet woollen-cloth.|$|E
6000|$|Arctic Sleeping-bags.--Arctic {{travellers}} use coarse <b>drugget</b> bags, {{covered with}} brown holland {{to make them}} less pervious to the wind, and having a long flap at the upper end to fold down over the face. I have already extracted passages from travellers' accounts relating to them, in speaking of [...] "Encamping on Snow," [...] p. 140, and another, when speaking of [...] "Snow-walls with Tenting for their Roofs," [...] p. 143.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a little}} hush, and every one had turned towards {{the upper end of}} the room. Some heavy {{curtains}} had been rolled aside, disclosing a space, only a few yards square, which had been covered by a tightly stretched <b>drugget.</b> There {{was a little}} curious anticipation amongst the uninitiated. Then the comparative silence was broken by the strains of a waltz from a violin, somewhere in the background. No one had ever heard it before. There was a wilder, dreamier air with it, than anything Waldteufel had ever written. And, while every one was wondering whose music it could be, a woman glided out from behind a screen, and stood for a second swaying herself slightly in the centre of the <b>drugget.</b> Even that slight rhythmical motion of her body seemed to bring her into perfect sympathy with the curious melody which was filling the hushed room. And while the people watched her, already, in varying degrees, under the spell of that curious fascination which her personality and the exercise of her art seldom failed to excite, she commenced to dance.|$|E
60|$|Come we next to {{the gross}} {{quantity}} of wool; as the Irish make all their own manufactures, that is to say, all the woollen manufactures, needful for their own use, such as for wearing apparel, house furniture, &c., we cannot suppose but that they use {{much more than the}} quantity exported to England, besides that, it is too well known, that notwithstanding the prohibition of exportation, they do daily ship off great quantities of woollen goods, not only to the West Indies, but also to France, to Spain, and Italy; and we have had frequent complaints of our merchants from Lisbon and Oporto, of the great quantity of Irish woollen manufactures that are brought thither, as well broadcloth as serges, <b>druggets,</b> duroys, frieze, long-ells, and all the other sorts of goods which are usually exported from England; add these clandestine exportations to the necessary clothing, furniture, and equipages, of that whole nation, in which are reckoned two millions and a half of people, and we cannot suppose they make use of less than two hundred thousand packs of wool yearly among themselves, which is the wool of fourteen millions of sheep more.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sir--I {{have the}} favour of yours of the 22d past, with your order for fifty fine <b>druggets,</b> {{to be made}} of the like weight and {{goodness}} with the two packs, No. A.B., which I made for you and sent last October, as also the five patterns enclosed, marked 1 to 5, for my direction in the mixture. I give you this trouble, according to your order, to let you know I have already put the said fifty pieces in hand; and as I am always willing to serve you {{to the best of my}} power, and am thankful for your favours, you may depend upon them within the time, that is to say, some time in February next, and that they shall be of the like fineness and substance with the other, and as near to the patterns as possible. But in regard our poor are very craving, and money at this time very scarce, I beg you will give me leave (twenty or thirty pieces of them being finished and delivered to you at any time before the remainder), to draw fifty pounds on you for present occasion; for which I shall think myself greatly obliged, and shall give you any security you please that the rest shall follow within the time.|$|R
60|$|The {{first and}} {{greatest}} shock our trade received, was from an act {{passed in the}} reign of King William, in the Parliament of England, prohibiting the exportation of wool manufactured in Ireland. An act (as the event plainly shews) fuller of greediness than good policy; an act as beneficial to France and Spain, {{as it has been}} destructive to England and Ireland.[103] At the passing of this fatal act, the condition of our trade was glorious and flourishing, though no way interfering with the English; we made no broad-cloths above 6s. per yard; coarse <b>druggets,</b> bays and shalloons, worsted damasks, strong draught works, slight half-works, and gaudy stuffs, were the only product of our looms: these were partly consumed by the meanest of our people, and partly sent to the northern nations, from which we had in exchange, timber, iron, hemp, flax, pitch, tar, and hard dollars. At the time the current money of Ireland was foreign silver, a man could hardly receive 100l., without finding the coin of all the northern powers, and every prince of the empire among it. This money was returned into England for fine cloths, silks, &c. for our own wear, for rents, for coals, for hardware, and all other English manufactures, and, in a great measure, supplied the London merchants with foreign silver for exportation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} {{it better than}} anything; and {{settlers}} go with their families. I would sooner go there than stay here in England. I could make the fires, and mend the clothes, and cook the food; and I could {{learn how to make}} the bread before we went. It would be nicer than anything--like playing at life over again, as we used to do when we made our tent with the <b>drugget,</b> and had our little plates and dishes." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{windows of}} Mrs. Rheinholdt's town house were ablaze with light. A crimson <b>drugget</b> {{stretched}} {{down the steps}} to the curbstone. A long row of automobiles stood waiting. Through the wide-flung doors was visible a pleasant impression of flowers and light and luxury. In the nearer of the two large reception rooms Mrs. Rheinholdt herself, a woman dark, handsome, and in the prime of life, was standing receiving her guests. By her side was her son, whose twenty-first birthday was being celebrated.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then at 4.45 A.M. I got up, {{a little}} later perhaps than usual. Codrington and Brooke were very soon at work {{finishing}} the decorations in the Chapel; branches of Norfolk Island pines, divers evergreens, pomegranates and oleanders and lilies (in handfuls) and large snow-white arums; on the altar-table arums above, and below lilies and evergreens. Oleanders and pomegranates marked the chancel arch. The rugs looked very handsome, the whole floor at the east end {{is covered with a}} red baize or <b>drugget</b> to match the curtains.|$|E
60|$|But, then, {{look into}} his books, and you shall find his factor at Blackwell Hall, who sells his cloths, or the warehouse-keeper who sells his duroys and <b>druggets,</b> or both together, have £2000 worth of goods in hand left unsold, and has trusted out to drapers, and mercers, and merchants, {{to the value of}} £4000 more; and {{look into his}} workhouse at home, namely, his wool-lofts, his combing-shop, his yarn-chamber, and the like, and there you will find it--in wool unspun, and in yarn spun, and in wool at the spinners', and in yarn at and in the looms at the weavers'; in rape-oil, gallipoli oil, and perhaps soap, &c, in his warehouses, and in cloths at the fulling-mill, and in his rowing-shops, {{finished}} and unfinished, £4000 worth of goods more; so that, though this clothier owed £5000 at his death, he has nevertheless died in good circumstances, and has £5000 estate clear to go among his children, all his debts paid and discharged. However, it is evident, that {{at the very beginning of}} this manufacturer's trade, his £5000 stock is made £10,000, by the help of his credit, and he trades for three times as much in the year; so that £5000 stock makes £10,000 stock and credit, and that together makes £30,000 a-year returned in trade.|$|R
60|$|But I had {{not done}} with my host; for after dinner, I took him into the same room, and told him I hoped {{he did not think}} I had made all my {{presents}} to the ladies, and had nothing left to show my respect to him; and therefore, first, I presented him with three negro men, which I had bought at Callao for my own use, but knew I could supply myself again, at or in my way home, at a moderate price; in the next place, I gave him three pieces of black Colchester baize, which, though they are coarse ordinary things in England, that a footman would scarce wear, are a habit for a prince in that country. I then gave him a piece of very fine English serge, which was really very valuable in England, but much more there, and another piece of crimson broadcloth, and six pieces of fine silk <b>druggets</b> for his two sons; and thus I finished my presents. The Spaniard stood still and looked on all the while I was laying out my presents to him, as one in a transport, and said not one word till all was over; but then he told me very gravely, that it was now time for him to turn me out of his house: For seignior, says he, no man ought to suffer himself to be obliged beyond his power of return, and I have no possible way of making any return to you equal to such things as these.|$|R
6000|$|As the {{manufactures}} of England, {{particularly those}} of wool (cotton wool included), and of silk, are the greatest, and amount to the greatest value of any single manufacture in Europe,[39] so they not only employ more people, but those people gain the most money, that is to say, have the best wages for their work of any people in the world; and yet, which is peculiar to England, the English manufactures are, allowing for their goodness, the cheapest at market of any in the world, too. Even France itself, after all the pains they are at to get our wool, and all the expense they have been at to imitate our manufactures, by getting over our workmen, and giving them even greater wages than they had here, have yet made so little proficiency in it, and are so far from outselling us in foreign markets, that they still, {{in spite of the}} strictest prohibitions, send hither, and to Holland and Germany, for English broad-cloths, <b>druggets,</b> duroys, flannels, serges, and several other sorts of our goods, to supply their own. Nor can they clothe themselves to their satisfaction with their own goods; but if any French gentleman of quality comes over hither from France, he is sure to bring no more coats with him than backs, but immediately to make him new clothes as soon as he arrives, and to carry as many new suits home with him at his return, as he can get leave to bring ashore when he comes there--a demonstration that our manufacture exceeds theirs, after all their boasts of it, both in goodness and in cheapness, even by their own confession. But I am not now to enter upon the particular manufactures, but the general trade in the manufacture; this particular being a trade of such a magnitude, it is to be observed for our purpose, that the greatness of it consists of two parts:-- ...|$|R
