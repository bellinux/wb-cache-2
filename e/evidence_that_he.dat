5|$|Although Shakespeare {{may have}} been acquainted with Robert Dover, there is no <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> ever {{attended}} the Games.|$|E
5|$|According to the Augustan History, Odaenathus was {{declared}} king of Palmyra {{as soon as}} the news of the Roman defeat at Edessa reached the city. It is not known if Odaenathus contacted Fulvius Macrianus and there is no <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> took orders from him.|$|E
5|$|In March 1979 at Stafford Crown Court {{he pleaded}} not guilty to murder but instead pleaded guilty to {{manslaughter}} on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The plea was accepted by the prosecution, after psychiatrists gave <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had an active paranoid psychosis. His indefinite detention was ordered by the trial judge, Mr Justice Stephen Brown, and he was held in Broadmoor Hospital and at Ashworth Hospital, both high security units.|$|E

5000|$|Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} album a grade of C−, calling it [...] "an {{annoying}} one." [...] Thomas Quinlan of Exclaim! said, [...] "While the mainstream {{might not be}} ready for Awol One, Owl Hours is <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> more than ready for them, and getting impatient." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} with Sigebert, Ecgric {{seems to have}} remained a pagan. There is no <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was baptised or that he promoted Christianity in East Anglia, according to D. P. Kirby, who notes that Bede wrote nothing that could imply that Ecgric was a Christian, in contrast to his praise of Sigeberht’s efforts to establish Christianity in East Anglia.|$|E
5|$|Leofric survived William the Conqueror's 1068 {{siege of}} Exeter unscathed, {{although}} there is no <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was present in the city during the siege. Whether Leofric had originally supported King Harold against William or if he supported William from the start is unclear. The fact that he survived William's purge of the native English bishops in 1070 is <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must not have been too outspoken against William. Leofric remained bishop until he died on 10 February or 11 February 1072. He was buried in the crypt of his cathedral. When the cathedral was rebuilt, his remains were moved to the new church, but the location of the tomb has been lost. The current tomb only dates from 1568 and does not mark Leofric's resting place.|$|E
5|$|Mallory's {{nomination}} as Secretary of the Navy {{was submitted}} to the Provisional Congress {{as soon as the}} act establishing a navy was passed. Despite his evident qualifications, it drew significant opposition; his detractors cited the Fort Pickens incident as <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was not strongly pro-secession. Ultimately, however, he was confirmed.|$|E
5000|$|Nicholas is {{mentioned}} as Bishop of Várad {{in the only}} extant royal charter of Géza II's brother, Stephen IV, in 1163. Stephen IV had seized the throne with Byzantine support from Géza II's minor son, Stephen III. The presence of Nicholas among the signatories on Stephen IV's charter <b>evidences</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> supported the usurper, along with his superior, Mikó, Archbishop of Kalocsa.|$|R
6000|$|... ... When {{he asks me}} why {{we cannot}} get along with it [slavery] in the {{attitude}} where our fathers placed it, he had better clear up the <b>evidences</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has himself changed it from <b>that</b> basis; <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has himself been chiefly instrumental in changing {{the policy of the}} fathers. Any one who will read his speech of the twenty-second of March last, will see <b>that</b> <b>he</b> there makes an open confession, showing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> set about fixing the institution upon an altogether different set of principles....|$|R
50|$|In April 1706 he was {{appointed}} Chief Justice of Pennsylvania, but no <b>evidence</b> exists <b>that</b> <b>he</b> ever entered upon his duties there.|$|R
5|$|New Formulation {{reviewer}} Michael Glavin cited Newman's {{ignorance of}} the initiative of anarchists to decentralize power and of anarchist forms of organisation such as trade unions, federations and affinity groups as <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> failed to understand power and wrongly conflated it with domination.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler's {{sexuality}} {{has long}} been a matter of historical and scholarly debate. There is <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had romantic encounters with a number of women during his lifetime, as well as evidence of his antipathy to homosexuality, and no evidence of homosexual encounters. His name has been linked to a number of possible female lovers, two of whom committed suicide. Another died of complications eight years after a suicide attempt, and one made a failed suicide attempt.|$|E
5|$|Albert Victor's intellect, {{sexuality}} {{and mental health}} {{have been the subject}} of speculation. Rumours linked him with the Cleveland Street scandal, which involved a homosexual brothel, but there is no conclusive <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> ever went there or was even homosexual. Some authors have argued that he was the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, but contemporary documents show that Albert Victor could not have been in London at the time of the murders, and the claim is widely dismissed.|$|E
50|$|Though {{some sources}} {{indicate}} that Iraj was schooled privately, there are reliable <b>evidences</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> studied at {{a branch of}} the Dārolfonoon (House of Sciences and Techniques) in Tabriz. At 15, he was fluent in Persian, French, Arabic and Azeri. He was also familiar with the art of calligraphy. His handwriting was very artistic and he was and still is considered as one of the famous calligraphers of Iran.|$|R
50|$|Akhtar {{was ordered}} freed from custody March 26, 2008 {{for lack of}} <b>evidence.</b> <b>That</b> September <b>he</b> was {{suspected}} {{to be involved in}} the Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing.|$|R
50|$|He was a {{descendant}} of American Revolutionary War Capt. Joshua Huddy, and lectured on Revolutionary War topics. <b>Evidence</b> exists <b>that</b> <b>he</b> later became a judge.|$|R
5|$|Also in 941, the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters {{reports that}} a {{chieftain}} named Áed Albanach was slain amongst a vast host of Dublin Vikings by the invading forces of Amargein mac Cináeda, overking of Uí Failge. The fact that Áed bore a Gaelic personal name, died with the Dubliners, and bore an epithet referring to a Scotsman, could be <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a successor of Gebeachan. Further evidence of {{this may be the}} record of Mór, a woman attested by the twelfth-century pseudo-historical Caithréim Chellacháin Chaisil, which identifies her as a daughter of a certain Áed mac Echach, and describes her as the daughter of a King of the Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|Although Alexander was a {{frequent}} witness to royal charters and documents, there is no <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> held an official government position after his appointment as bishop, unlike his relatives Roger and Nigel. Nevertheless, Alexander subsequently appears to have become a regular presence at the royal court. He frequently attested royal charters after 1123, and probably acted as a royal justice in Lincolnshire {{and the town of}} Lincoln. He also held the royal castles at Newark, Sleaford and Banbury, and gave confirmations of grants to the church at Godstow.|$|E
5|$|Although modest {{about his}} own {{abilities}} and generous in his praise of other cricketers, Bradman was {{fully aware of the}} talents he possessed as a player; there is some <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> sought to influence his legacy. During the 1980s and 1990s, Bradman carefully selected the people to whom he gave interviews, assisting Michael Page, Roland Perry and Charles Williams, who all produced biographical works about him. Bradman also agreed to an extensive interview for ABC radio, broadcast as Bradman: The Don Declares in eight 55-minute episodes during 1988.|$|E
50|$|However, Banneker {{completed}} his clock {{at the age}} of 22, when he was still a young man. No historical <b>evidence</b> shows <b>that</b> <b>he</b> constructed the clock from memory.|$|R
50|$|No sources report Mikhail’s marriage, but <b>evidence</b> {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> married Elena Romanovna (or Maria Romanovna), {{a daughter}} of prince Roman Mstislavich of Halych in 1210 or 1211.|$|R
50|$|Kerry Boren {{says that}} Lopez died in 1916 during {{a battle between}} American and Villista forces, but most <b>evidence</b> {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was killed by Frank Hamer in 1921.|$|R
5|$|Carol L. Valenzuela, 20, {{was last}} seen hitchhiking near Vancouver, Washington, on August 2, 1974. Her remains were {{discovered}} two months later in a shallow grave south of Olympia, {{along with those of}} another female later identified as Martha Morrison, 17 (last seen in Eugene, Oregon on September 1, 1974). Both victims had long hair parted in the middle. In August 1974 Bundy drove from Seattle to Salt Lake City and could have passed through Vancouver and Eugene en route, but there is no <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did. Both cases remain open.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} among his contemporaries for untruth and fantasy, Morrell has been defended by some later commentators who, while questioning his general reliability, maintain {{that not all}} his life was fraud and exaggeration. They believe that aside from the bombast and boastful tone of the account that carries his name, there is <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> carried out useful work, such his discovery of large-scale guano deposits {{which led to the}} development of a full-scale industry. He is believed to have died in 1838 or 1839, in Mozambique; there is, however, evidence to suggest that this death might have been staged, and that he lived on in exile, possibly in South America.|$|E
5|$|Forty {{minutes after}} landing, Sigma 7 was hoisted aboard Kearsarge; five minutes later, Schirra blew the {{explosive}} hatch and climbed {{out to a}} waiting crowd. After doing this, examinations showed clear bruising on his hand from operating the heavy ejector switch, which he felt provided an important vindication for fellow pilot Gus Grissom's hatch expulsion accident during the Liberty Bell 7 mission. Grissom had maintained that the hatch blew without his input; {{the fact that he}} had no bruising was seen as <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not blown the hatch early and sunk his capsule, but that it was a mechanical malfunction.|$|E
50|$|Lovato's {{surviving}} prose in the British Library manuscript <b>evidenced</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> adhered {{strictly to}} medieval ars dictaminis, following obediently the standard medieval model for writing prose {{which consists of}} salutatio, followed by exordium, narratio, petitio, and conclusio. Stylistically, Lovato's prose has a solemn tone of voice and the language was medieval in character with over emphasis on colores. Lovato displayed a preference for stylus altus (high style) form of letter writing, which was the most prestigious and difficult of them all.|$|R
50|$|Jeyavarman IV (ជ័យវរ្ម័នទី៤) was an Angkorian {{king who}} ruled from 928 to 941 CE. Many early historians thought <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a usurper. However, recent <b>evidence</b> shows <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had a {{legitimate}} {{claim to the}} throne.|$|R
50|$|There {{were rumors}} that Bohlen {{was killed by}} one of his own men, but <b>evidence</b> {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was liked by his troops and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died from enemy fire through a shot by a Confederate sharpshooter.|$|R
5|$|Historians are {{agreed that}} the {{introduction}} and conclusion were added by a different author {{than that of the}} Libellus. Who that was, however, is open to debate. The historian C. W. David felt that it was {{based on the work of}} the chronicler Symeon of Durham, which thus made a credible date for the creation sometime between 1109 and 1129. David also felt that the Vita was used by a later work of Symeon's, the Historia Regum. Offler, however, felt that although Symeon knew of the Libellus, there was no <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> used the Vita, which would leave the author of the Vita unclear.|$|E
5|$|In general relativity, the apsides of any orbit (the {{point of}} the {{orbiting}} body's closest approach to the system's center of mass) will precess—the orbit is not an ellipse, but akin to an ellipse that rotates on its focus, resulting in a rose curve-like shape (see image). Einstein first derived this result by using an approximate metric representing the Newtonian limit and treating the orbiting body as a test particle. For him, {{the fact that his}} theory gave a straightforward explanation of Mercury's anomalous perihelion shift, discovered earlier by Urbain Le Verrier in 1859, was important <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had at last identified the correct form of the gravitational field equations.|$|E
5|$|Jackie's friends Cindy, Andy, and Randall {{had become}} {{suspicious}} {{as to whether}} Jackie's date to the fraternity party where she was allegedly raped was a real person. Prior to the date, they attempted to locate him in a student directory and were unable to find <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> existed. The trio also sent text messages to a phone number Jackie said was the mobile phone of her date and were surprised that {{the owner of the}} phone number responded primarily with flattering messages about Randall, whom Jackie was romantically interested in.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Independent Counsel’s {{judgment}} <b>that</b> sufficient <b>evidence</b> existed {{to prosecute}} President Clinton {{was confirmed by}} President Clinton’s admissions and by <b>evidence</b> showing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice." ...|$|R
5000|$|Acts of preparation: In R v Troskie, too, {{the accused}} {{was charged with}} incest with his sister. <b>Evidence</b> was allowed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had {{previously}} attempted to {{have sexual relations with}} her. See also R v Hair, where the accused was charged with the theft of shares. <b>Evidence</b> was allowed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had forged certain documents in order to obtain them.|$|R
50|$|Evidence {{indicate}} also {{an illegitimate}} son, Erik Sjællandsfar at Orebygård on Zealand, buried in Roskilde Cathedral with a crown. However, other <b>evidence</b> indicate <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{a son of}} King Valdemar IV of Denmark.|$|R
