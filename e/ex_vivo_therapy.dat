50|$|The {{success of}} gene therapy {{depends on the}} {{efficient}} insertion of therapeutic genes at the appropriate chromosomal target sites within the human genome, without causing cell injury, oncogenic mutations or an immune response. The construction of plasmid vectors is simple and straightforward. Custom-designed ZFNs that combine the non-specific cleavage domain (N) of FokI endonuclease with zinc-finger proteins (ZFPs) offer a general way to deliver a site-specific DSB to the genome, and stimulate local homologous recombination by several orders of magnitude. This makes targeted gene correction or genome editing a viable option in human cells. Since ZFN-encoding plasmids {{could be used to}} transiently express ZFNs to target a DSB to a specific gene locus in human cells, they offer an excellent way for targeted delivery of the therapeutic genes to a pre-selected chromosomal site. The ZFN-encoding plasmid-based approach has the potential to circumvent all the problems associated with the viral delivery of therapeutic genes. The first therapeutic applications of ZFNs are likely to involve <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>therapy</b> using a patients own stem cells. After editing the stem cell genome, the cells could be expanded in culture and reinserted into the patient to produce differentiated cells with corrected functions. The initial targets will likely include the causes of monogenic diseases such as the IL2Rγ gene and the b-globin gene for gene correction and CCR5 gene for mutagenesis and disablement.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Intrauterine {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} is a promising approach for early onset genetic diseases. However, its utility {{is limited by}} the development of the fetal immune system after 14 weeks gestation. An <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> gene <b>therapy</b> approach targeting autologous first trimester stem cells to replace the missing or defective gene product should overcome this barrier. We investigated the feasibility of harvesting circulating first trimester human fetal mesenchymal stem cells (hfMSCs) for <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> gene <b>therapy.</b> METHODS: Thin-gauge embryofetoscopic-directed or ultrasound-guided blood sampling (FBS) was performed in 18 pre-termination fetuses at a mean of 10 (+ 0) (range 7 (+ 2) to 13 (+ 4)) weeks gestation through extra-fetal vessels. Harvested blood was plated for isolation of hfMSC and transduced by lentiviruses. RESULTS: FBS was successful in 12 / 18 procedures (67 %). Success rates were comparable in fetoscopic (4 / 6) and ultrasound-guided (8 / 12) procedures, but procedural time was shorter in the ultrasound-guided arm (P = 0. 01). Fetal bradycardia occurred post-FBS in 33 % and 25 % of fetoscopic and ultrasound cases, respectively, 5 min post-procedure. hfMSCs were isolated in two-thirds of cases, with high efficiency lentiviral transduction achieved without affecting short-term cell renewal. CONCLUSIONS: This phase-one study demonstrates the feasibility of the <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> fetal gene <b>therapy</b> approach, in which harvested hfMSCs are genetically manipulated prior to infusion back into the fetus where they should engraft and home to injured tissues. The fetal <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> gene <b>therapy</b> paradigm is also of relevance to haemopoietic stem cells to treat inherited haematological diseases.

40|$|Abstract:In {{the last}} 20 years {{epidermal}} stem cells have been extensively used for tissue regeneration of epidermis and other epithelial surfaces. The tremendous progress achieved {{has led to}} the development of protocols aimed at the correction of rare genetic disorders such as epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a severe, often lethal, blistering disorder of the skin. Approximately 400, 000 – 500, 000 people are affected worldwide and no definitive treatments have yet been developed. Gene therapy might represent an alternative therapeutic approach. This paper reviews the different strategies used to genetically modify keratinocytes from EB patients and addresses issues such as the use of in vivo or ex vivo approaches, how to target keratinocytes with stem cell properties in order to have long-term therapeutic gene expression, and which gene transfer agents should be used.

The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether the deleterious effects of radiotherapy could be overcome by <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> gene <b>therapy</b> to heal craniofacial defects. Rat calvarial critical-sized defects were treated with either an inlay calvarial bone graft or syngeneic dermal fibroblasts transduced <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> with an adenovirus engineered to express bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP- 7), a morphogen known to stimulate bone formation. Two weeks postoperatively, either no radiation or a single 12 -Gy radiation dose was delivered to the operated area and the tissue was harvested 4 weeks later. None of the inlay bone grafts healed at the wound margins of either the radiated or nonradiated sites. In contrast, bone was successfully regenerated when using an <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> gene <b>therapy</b> approach. More bone formed in the nonradiated group as determined by the percentage of defect surface covered (87 ± 4. 1 versus 65 ± 4. 7 %; p = 0. 003) and percentage of defect area filled by new bone (60 ± 5. 9 versus 32 ± 2. 7 %; p = 0. 002). Although the effects of radiation on the wound were not completely overcome by the gene therapy approach, bone regeneration was still successful despite the radiation sensitivity of the fibroblasts.

40|$|Craniofacial anomalies, bone {{defects and}} {{cartilage}} lesions pose {{a difficult and}} challenging problem for both the doctor and for patients and their families. Conventional therapies focus on orthopaedic surgery, grafting with autogenous bone, allogenic bone grafts, or distraction osteogenesis. However, the efficacy of these techniques is limited by high cost, donor morbidity, scarcity of tissue resources, and alterations in volume [Marx & Morales, 1988]. On the basis of recent insights into the development, growth, and adaptation of bone, together with the significant advances in recombinant DNA technology, gene therapy is increasingly becoming recognised as an alternative technique for augmenting and promoting bone regeneration in vivo. It can be applied in craniofacial skeletal tissues by transferring genes encoding for specific growth factors such as BMPs in osteoblasts, chondrocytes or progenitor cells {{for the purpose of}} enhancing protein production [Scaduto & Lieberman, 1999].

40|$|AbstractPurposeIn our {{previous}} study, adenovirus-mediated ex vivo gene transfer of {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} promoted significant collateral vessel {{development in a}} rabbit model of hind limb ischemia. The present study examined how to control the efficacy and safety of this gene therapy, and also evaluated the feasibility of repeat application of this procedure. MethodsModified hFGF gene with the secretory signal sequence was adenovirally transferred to cultured autologous fibroblasts, and various numbers of the cells (2 × 105, 1 × 106, 5 × 106, or 2. 5 × 107) or vehicle was injected through the left internal iliac artery in rabbits in whom the left femoral artery had been excised 21 days previously. Twenty-eight days after cell administration, calf blood pressure ratio, angiographic score, blood flow in the internal iliac artery, and capillary density of muscle tissue were measured to analyze collateral vessel development and tissue perfusion in the ischemic limb. To assess delivery efficiency and viral contamination, the distribution of injected cells and the time course of blood anti-adenovirus antibody titer were examined in rabbits treated with various numbers of gene-transduced cells. In addition, animals received two injections, 21 days apart, of fibroblasts infected with adenovirus vector containing the luciferase gene, and luciferase expression was measured to evaluate whether the present therapy is repeatable. ResultsAt 28 days after cell administration, significant collateral vessel development without detectable side effects was observed in rabbits who received 5 × 106 or 2. 5 × 107 cells, compared with those who received vehicle, and no significant development was detected in animals with fewer than 5 × 106 cells (P <. 01 for calf blood pressure ratio and capillary density, P <. 05 for angiographic score and maximum blood flow). There was no difference in collateral augmentation between rabbits with 5 × 106 and 2. 5 × 107 cells. However, in animals with 2. 5 × 107 cells a large number of injected cells accumulated in the lungs, anti-adenovirus antibody titer increased significantly, and calf blood pressure in the left hind limb of two rabbits decreased immediately after injection. Luciferase analysis showed very low gene expression after repeated administration. ConclusionThese findings suggest that 5 × 106 is a suitable number of cells to induce appropriate collateral vessel development and minimize potential side effects of this procedure. Despite use of ex vivo gene transfer, repeat administration of the cells was not feasible. Clinical relevanceSince the present study determined the appropriate conditions for effective and safe stimulation of collateral vessels, the clinical relevance of the <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>therapy</b> might be carried forward. However, the findings raised another issue that should be resolved before clinical application; that is, the number of gene-transduced cells able to be injected was strictly limited.

40|$|Im Gegensatz zu Strategien basierend auf die Einführung von transgenenen Zellen, die Wachstumsfaktoren exprimieren, oder die direkte Administration von rekombinanten Wachstumsfaktoren in vivo, bietet die Gentherapie (Einführung von exogener DNA kodierend für einen Wachstumsfaktor) eine einfach anzuwendende, kostengünstige Alternative, verbunden mit erhöhter Bioaktivität der exprimierten Wachstumsfaktoren (durch wirtszell-spezifischer post-translationaler Modifikation und korrekter Faltung der lokal durch die Zielzellen produzierten Wachstumsfaktoren). Jedoch ist der Einsatz von viralen Vektoren, die eine effiziente Einschleusung von Fremd-DNA in Zielzellen in vivo garantieren, wegen der Auslösung einer Immunantwort und das Integrieren der Fremd-DNA in das Genom der Zielzelle, ungeeignet. Nicht-virale Vektoren hingegen bieten eine hohe Sicherheit und erzeugen eine geringfügige Immunantwort, sind jedoch in ihrer Fähigkeit Zielzellen in vivo zu transfizieren, beschränkt. Die physische und chemische Barriere der Zellmembran, der lysosomale Abbau und die geringe Effizienz der Diffusion der eingeführten DNA in den Zellkern limitiert die Wirksamkeit der Transfektion erheblich. Diese Arbeit war ausgerichtet, den lysosomalen Abbau eingeführter Makromoleküle wie DNA zu verhindern um die Transfektionseffizienz zu erhöhen. Um den lysosomalen Abbau zu vermeiden und dadurch die Wahrscheinlichkeit der Einführung therapeutischer DNA in das Zytosol bzw. den Zellkern zu erhöhen, wurde versucht, mithilfe eines bakteriellen Proteins (Listeriolysin O) die Lysosomen während der endozytischen Aufnahme der DNA zu zerstören. Durch die pH-abhängige Aktivierung der Hämolysins in der lysosomalen Umgebung werden die Lysosomen zerstört und die endozytotisch aufgenommene therapeutische DNA ins Zytosol freigesetzt. Listeriolysin O wurde in E. coli exprimiert und anschließend biochemisch aufgereinigt, um dessen Einfluss auf die DNA-Transfektion in eukaryotischen Zellen zu ermitteln. Bei Anwesenheit von Listeriolysin O zeigte sich eine erhöhte Präsenz von aufgenommenen Molekülen (DNA, Farbstoff) im Zytosol der Zielzellen. In {{contrast}} to strategies {{based on the}} introduction of transgenic cells expressing growth factors (<b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>therapy),</b> or the direct administration of recombinant growth factors into target systems, in vivo gene therapy approaches (introduction of therapeutic plasmids encoded for growth factors) provide a promising alternative associated with lower manufacturing costs, higher safety and increased bioactivity of the produced proteins (due to host-specific post-translational modifications and correct folding of the locally produced growth factors). Utilizing viral particles for high transfection efficiencies (high efficiency for DNA introduction into target cells in vivo) is unsuitable due to the high immunogenicity {{and the nature of}} some viral vectors to manipulate the host genome. On the other hand, non-viral gene delivery methods provide high safety and low immune response, but are limited in their transfection efficiency. Main reasons for impaired transfection capacity are confined cellular uptake of the exogenous DNA, the lysosomal degradation after uptake and the low efficiency of the introduced plasmid DNA to diffuse into the cell nucleus. This study was focused on the lysosomal degradation which highly limits the transfection efficiency. In order to avoid the lysosomal degradation of introduced therapeutic DNA and therefore to significantly increase the probability of the engulfed DNA to overcome the lysosomal barrier, the influence of the hemolytic protein listeriolysin O, derived from the intracellular bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, was tested in gene delivery approaches. During the life cycle of Listeria monocytogenes, the hemolytic protein is secreted after the engulfment of the bacteria in order to disrupt the lysosomes and to ensure the bacterial entry into the cytosol of target cells. The main advantage of listeriolysin O is its hemolytic activity to disrupt eukaryotic membranes restricted only under acidic conditions (below pH = 6) as given in the lysosomes. Due to this pH dependent activity of listeriolysin O, and the subsequent deactivation by aggregation after exposition to physiological pH conditions (pH = 7), the subsequent disruption of the host cell membrane is avoided preventing the host cell from lysis. Based on this, listeriolysin O is a promising auxiliary protein for the enhancement of the transfection efficiency. The hlyA gene, encoded for Listeriolysin O and lacking its secretion signal, was C-terminally linked to a polyhistidine tag and cloned into a bacterial expression vector following expression in E. coli. Subsequent optimization of the protein purification was performed to attain high yields of pure and bioactive LLO, extensively exceeding presently published results concerning total yield of LLO and effort of the purification method. The influence of the purified LLO in cell transfection approaches was tested in vitro. The DNA was prelabeled with the fluorescence dye and complexed with the polycationic DNA carrier poly-L-lysine (PLL). Particles were transferred to the cells and the uptake efficiency of the particles was observed in the presence and absence of LLO after 15 minutes under fluorescence excitation to confirm the subsequent access of the DNA dye into the cell nucleus after lysosomal disruption by LLO. By comparing the uptake of the fluorescence labeled DNA microparticles, a remarkable increase of the uptake was observed within the first 15 minutes under the fluorescence microscope when LLO and the DNA microparticles were simultaneously transferred to the cells. In contrast, transfection of cells in the absence of LLO showed an entrapment of the microparticles inside the lysosomes within the same time period...|$|E

40|$|Experimental cell or <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> gene <b>therapy</b> for {{localized}} {{bone formation}} typically uses osteoprogenitor cells propagated from periosteum or bone marrow. Both require bone or marrow biopsies to obtain cells. We {{have demonstrated that}} implantation of gingival or dermal fibroblasts transduced with BMP <b>ex</b> <b>vivo,</b> using a recombinant adenovirus (AdCMVBMP) attached to porous biodegradable scaffolds, form bone in vivo. Here we show that BMP- 7 -transduced fibroblasts suspended in injectable thermoset hydrogels form complete ossicles on subcutaneous injection and repair segmental defects in rat femurs. Bone formation was preceded by an intermediate cartilage stage. To determine {{the fate of the}} implanted transduced cells, thermoset hydrogel suspensions of <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> BMP- 7 -transduced or nontransduced fibroblasts were placed in diffusion chambers and implanted to allow development in vivo without direct contact with host cells. Only the BMP-transduced fibroblasts formed bone within the diffusion chambers in vivo, revealing that BMP transduction induces osteoblastic conversion of these cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} the liver to {{regenerate}} is widely acknowledged, and this is usually accomplished by the entry of normally proliferatively quiescent hepatocytes into the cell cycle. However, when hepatocyte regeneration is impaired, small bile ducts proliferate and invade into the adjacent hepatocyte parenchyma. In humans and experimental animals these ductal cells {{are referred to as}} oval cells, and their association with defective regeneration has led to the belief that they are the progeny of facultative stem cells. Oval cells are of great biological interest since they may represent a target population for hepatic carcinogens, and they may also be useful vehicles for <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> gene <b>therapy</b> for the correction of inborn errors of metabolism...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this report was to provide {{detailed}} information on the safety and feasibility of surgical procedures associated with the first <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> liver-directed gene <b>therapy</b> trial for the treatment of <b>vivo</b> gene <b>therapy</b> for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disease in which the gene encoding the low density lipoprotein receptor is defective. Patients homozygous for this mutation have extraordinarily high levels of cholesterol and accelerated atherosclerosis and die prematurely of myocardial infarction. The concept of liver-directed gene therapy was based on the report of normalization of cholesterol levels by orthotopic cardiac/liver transplant in a child with homozygous FH. METHODS: Five patients with homozygous FH were selected for inclusion in this trial. The patients underwent hepatic resection and placement of a portal venous catheter. Primary hepatocytes cultures were prepared from the resected liver and transduced with a recombinant retrovirus encoding the gene for the human low density lipoprotein receptor. The genetically modified cells were then transplanted into the liver through the portal venous catheter. RESULTS: Numerous clinical, laboratory, and radiologic parameters were analyzed. Elevations of the hepatic transaminases and leukocyte counts and a decline in hematocrit count were noted. Transient elevations of the portal pressure were observed during cell infusion. No major perioperative morbidity [...] specifically, myocardial infarct, perioperative hemorrhage, or portal vein thrombosis [...] or death occurred {{as a result of this}} protocol. CONCLUSION: Liver-directed <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> gene <b>therapy</b> can be accomplished safely in humans and is appropriate for selected patients...|$|R
40|$|Background Replacing mutant skin in {{epidermolysis bullosa}} (EB) by {{epithelial}} sheets of transduced autologous keratinocytes {{is the essential}} surgical step of <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> gene <b>therapy.</b> The same applies for revertant cell therapy in which epithelial sheets of revertant autologous keratinocytes are used. Revertant cells {{can be found in}} patches of normal skin in patients with junctional EB (JEB) due to revertant mosaicism caused by in vivo reversions. Objectives To develop a technique of adhesive tape stripping as a method for epidermis removal to prepare the acceptor site for revertant cell therapy in a patient with revertant mosaic JEB. Methods We performed revertant cell therapy on a patient with mosaic type XVII collagen-deficient non-Herlitz JEB. Skin biopsies were taken from revertant skin on the wrist. Graft production took place on a 3 T 3 -J 2 feeder layer resulting in two 6 x 7 cm grafts. An innovative method that uses the pathological plane of least resistance of JEB skin was developed to prepare the acceptor site. A polyacrylate adhesive plaster was placed on the skin and then pulled off with the epidermis. Results The epidermis was easily removed with the plaster. The skin separated {{at the level of the}} lamina lucida, leaving a bloodless wound bed of naked lamina densa. Transplantation was successful; the acceptor site healed without scarring. However, blistering could be provoked. The functional repair was not achieved due to the low percentage of revertant cells in the graft. Conclusions We conclude that adhesive stripping is a simple, effective and almost painless procedure for removing epidermis for <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> cell <b>therapy</b> in EB...|$|R
40|$|In {{cases of}} craniosynostosis, {{defined as the}} {{premature}} fusion of the cranial sutures, {{there is a need}} to inhibit bone formation in small calvarial defects to avoid the occurrence of postoperative resynostosis. Similarly, reconstruction of bone in the craniofacial skeleton following injury or tumor resection necessitates controlled bone regeneration to avoid bone overgrowth. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are potent bone inducing growth factors that are expressed during normal bone healing. Noggin is an extracellular antagonist to BMPs. This work studied the use of Noggin to prevent postoperative resynostosis in a rabbit model of human nonsyndromic craniosynostosis via protein therapy. A mouse model of a healing suturectomy was also developed. This model was used to study the effects of Noggin <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> gene <b>therapy</b> on the inhibition of postoperative resynostosis. Finally, the ability of Noggin to inhibit bone overgrowth and improve BMP 4 -induced bone formation was tested. The work presented here demonstrates that a single dose of Noggin protein is capable of inhibiting resynostosis and improving craniofacial growth after surgery to correct craniosynostosis in rabbits. Noggin delivered through <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> gene <b>therapy</b> was able to inhibit bone formation in a novel mouse model. Also, the implantation of Noggin expressing cells along with BMP 4 expressing cells reduced ectopic bone formation and improved bone density. These results suggest that Noggin therapy may be useful for the inhibition of postoperative resynostosis in children with craniosynostosis. Furthermore, by recreating naturally occurring expression patterns (for example, both Noggin and BMP 4), we may be able to control the size, shape and quality of bone formed by biologically-driven therapies...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSomatic {{stem cells}} ensure tissue renewal along life and healing of injuries. Their safe isolation, genetic {{manipulation}} <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> and reinfusion in patients suffering from life threatening immune deficiencies (for example, {{severe combined immunodeficiency}} (SCID)) have demonstrated the efficacy of <b>ex</b> <b>vivo</b> gene <b>therapy.</b> Similarly, adult epidermal stem cells {{have the capacity to}} renew epidermis, the fully differentiated, protective envelope of our body. Stable skin replacement of severely burned patients have proven life saving. Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a devastating disease due to severe defects in the repair of mutagenic DNA lesions introduced upon exposure to solar radiations. Most patients die from the consequences of budding hundreds of skin cancers in the absence of photoprotection. We have developed a safe procedure of genetic correction of epidermal stem cells isolated from XP patients. Preclinical and safety assessments indicate successful correction of XP epidermal stem cells in the long term and their capacity to regenerate a normal skin with full capacities of DNA repair...|$|R
