40|$|Purpose The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the increase in temperature of ultrasound gel under an infant radiant <b>heat</b> <b>warmer.</b> Materials and methods Ten 10 millilitre blobs of ultrasound gel (EcoGel 200, Eco-Med Pharmaceuticals Inc., Ontario, Canada) were placed on an open cot under a radiant warmer (V- 3200 N Atom Infant-Warmer, Atom Medical Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) set at maximum heat output. The temperature of the gel blobs was taken with an electronic thermometer (Orion 290 A, Orion Research Inc., Boston, USA) every 10 minutes up to 60 minutes. The mean temperature of the 10 blobs were compared using the student t test. Results The gel increased in temperature from a mean of 21. 57 degrees C (SD = 0. 29) to 26. 76 degrees C (SD= 0. 4) after 60 minutes - an increase of 5. 19 degrees C. The rise in temperature reached a plateau after 30 - 40 minutes. The room temperature was 24. 9 degrees C. Conclusion The temperature of ultrasound gel under a radiant <b>heat</b> <b>warmer</b> increases by less than 6 degrees C. It is therefore unlikely that ultrasound gel placed under a radiant <b>heat</b> <b>warmer</b> for less than 1 hour would lead to thermal injury in the neonate...|$|R

40|$|A non-sprinkling snow-melting {{pavement}} {{has generally}} adopted groundwater 	heat, ground <b>heat,</b> <b>heated</b> <b>warm</b> water, etc. as heat sources. The temperature level of 	the heat source is around 10 - 15 ℃ except <b>heated</b> <b>warm</b> water and {{is by no}} means high. 	Therefore, we have to better understand the heat transfer between a heat injection pipe 	and the surrounding pavement. This is indispensable to economical and reliable design 	of the non-sprinkling snow-melting pavement. 	A theoretical model is proposed to evaluate the snow-melting performance of 	the pavements with folded serpentine piping configurations. The pavement heat 	exchanger is modeled as a straight panel incorporating both a going and return pipes 	can be treated as line heat sources {{to be added to the}} equation for vertical heat flow in 	the pavement. This results in a system of one-dimensional equations that is rapid for 	design calculations. 	The accuracy of the numerical model is shown from the comparison of the fluid 	temperature distributions along the heat injection pipe and of the vertical temperature 	profile in the pavement at three different experimental sites. The model could also lead 	the overall heat transfer coefficients between the fluid in the heat injection pipe and the 	surrounding pavement...|$|R

40|$|<b>Heat</b> {{waves and}} <b>warm</b> spells are extreme {{meteorological}} events that generate {{a significant number}} of casualties in temperate regions, as well as outside of temperate regions. For the purpose of this paper, <b>heat</b> waves and <b>warm</b> spells were identified based on daily maximum temperatures recorded at 27 weather stations located in Romania over a 55 -year period (1961 – 2015). The intensity threshold was the 90 th percentile, and the length of an event was of minimum three consecutive days. We analyzed 111 <b>heat</b> wave and <b>warm</b> spell events totaling 423 days. The classification of synoptic conditions was based on daily reanalysis at three geopotential levels and on the online version of a backward trajectories model. The main findings are that there are two major types of genetic conditions. These were identified as: (i) radiative <b>heat</b> waves and <b>warm</b> spells (type A) generated by warming the air mass due to high amounts of radiation which was found dominant in warm season; and (ii) advective <b>heat</b> waves and <b>warm</b> spells (type B) generated mainly by warm air mass advection which prevails in winter and transition seasons. These major types consist of two and three sub-types, respectively. The results could become a useful tool for weather forecasters in order to better predict the occurrence of <b>heat</b> waves and <b>warm</b> spells...|$|R
