50|$|Dihydroergocryptine is {{a mixture}} of two very similar compounds, alpha- and beta-dihydroergocryptine (<b>epicriptine)</b> at a ratio of 2:1. The beta differs from the alpha form only in the {{position}} of a single methyl group, which is a consequence of the biosynthesis of the parent compound ergocryptine, in which the proteinogenic amino acid leucine is replaced by isoleucine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Epicriptine</b> or beta-dihydroergocryptine is a {{dopamine}} agonist of the ergoline class. It constitutes {{one third}} of the mixture known as dihydroergocryptine, the other two thirds consisting of alpha-dihydroergocryptine. The alpha differs from the beta form only in the position of a single methyl group, which is a consequence of the biosynthesis in which the proteinogenic amino acid isoleucine is replaced by leucine.|$|E
