25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Vought {{engineer}} Rex B. Beisel was tasked with designing an observation monoplane aircraft for the U.S. Navy {{suitable for a}} multitude of tasks including directing battleship fire. In replacing the standard biplane observation aircraft with a more modern monoplane design, Beisel incorporated innovations becoming the first production type to be assembled with spot welding, a process Vought and the Naval Aircraft Factory jointly developed to create a smooth fuselage that resisted buckling and generated less drag. Beisel also introduced high-lift devices, spoilers and in a unique arrangement, <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> flaps and drooping ailerons located on {{the trailing edge of}} the wing were deployed to increase the camber of the wing and thus create additional lift.|$|E
25|$|Ten {{locomotives}} (numbers 92020-92029) {{were built}} in 1955 with the Franco-Crosti boiler. which incorporated a combustion gas feed water preheater that recuperated low-grade residual heat In the 9F version, this {{took the form of}} a single cylindrical water drum running along the underside of the main boiler barrel. The standard chimney on top of the smokebox was only used during lighting up. In normal working the gases went through firetubes inside the preheater drum that led to a second smokebox situated beneath the boiler from which there emerged a chimney on the right-hand side, just forward of the firebox. In the event, the experiment did not deliver the hoped-for benefits, and efficiency was not increased sufficiently to justify the cost and complexity. Moreover, conditions were unpleasant on the footplate in a cross-wind, this in spite of the later provision of a small <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> forward of the chimney. These problems led to the subsequent removal of the preheater drum, although the locomotives did retain the original main smokebox with its distinctive look.|$|E
50|$|The firebox {{door was}} also of novel design. As the {{backplate}} sloped so steeply, {{the door was}} top-hinged and opened inwards, rather than outwards. This also {{had the effect of}} acting as a <b>deflector</b> <b>plate,</b> directing the cold draught down onto the firebed, rather than directly across and into the tubes.|$|E

40|$|We have {{implemented}} a fast switching electrostatic {{system on the}} actinides beamline on the ANTARES accelerator at ANSTO, to improve the precision of analyses by accelerator mass spectrometry. This high-energy bouncing system {{is based on a}} pair of <b>deflector</b> <b>plates,</b> deflecting in the orbit plane, set at the entrance and exit of the analysing magnet. The design of <b>deflector</b> <b>plates</b> is unique, and it was modelled by SIMION in order to minimize field inhomogenity and fringe field effects. The pair of <b>deflector</b> <b>plates</b> are supplied by a high-voltage amplifier driven by an EPICS-enabled control unit, with two 4 W power supplies providing up to ± 10 kV modulation. The high-energy bouncing system is synchronized with the existing low-energy bouncing system. To measure the isotopic ratio with the new system, the magnetic fields of the injector and analysing magnets are set to transmit selected isotopes along the beam line with zero voltage applied. The other isotopes of interest are transmitted by keeping the magnetic fields constant and modulating the voltages on the injector magnet chamber and on the high-energy <b>deflector</b> <b>plates...</b>|$|R

50|$|A team of RhCE engineers' and RhACR and RR {{mechanics}} {{were able}} to produce {{in a single day}} an armoured steel body for the mine-protected base, its design being developed from an adapted and heavily modified hull of the West German Thyssen Henschel UR-416 armoured car. Other internal modifications requested by the RhACR, involving engine, steering, brakes and the gearbox (a <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> had to be added to protect it from centre landmine blasts) were also incorporated.|$|E
5000|$|Another of Kirtley's {{achievements}} in 1859 was, at last, {{to solve the}} problem of coal burning, by combining the brick arch with a firehole door <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> and a blower to increase the draught. Research into track wear was carried out by Robert Forester Mushet, who produced the first double-headed rail using Bessemer steel. Whereas wrought iron rails lasted typically six months, a length of steel rail laid near Derby station 1857 was still in use in 1873.|$|E
50|$|In the event, the {{experiment}} did not deliver the hoped-for benefits, and efficiency was not increased sufficiently {{to justify the}} cost and complexity. Moreover, conditions were unpleasant on the footplate in a cross-wind, this in spite the later provision of a small <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> forward of the chimney. These problems led to the subsequent sealing off of the preheater drum, over the period 1959-1961, and the locomotives were then worked conventionally. As a result of this, there was a reduced ability to generate steam, and so their power classification was reduced from 9F to 8F.|$|E
25|$|Bullet <b>deflector</b> <b>plates</b> were {{installed}} over the rear fenders. The idea behind these plates {{was that the}} tank could drive over a trench, and the rear sponson machine guns could then fire onto the plates; the bullets would deflect into the trench or the area directly behind the tank. Like the sponson machine guns themselves, the <b>deflector</b> <b>plates</b> {{turned out to be}} useless. However, the idea was used again on M5 light tanks in the Normandy campaign.|$|R
25|$|Despite this, a {{dedicated}} single-seat fighter version {{was built in}} 1915, armed with an 8mm Hotchkiss machine gun that fired through the propeller arc, the propeller blades being protected by <b>deflector</b> <b>plates.</b> Only one or two prototypes were built, and the type never entered service.|$|R

50|$|Like most {{traditional}} smokers, early pellet grills {{were limited to}} indirect cooking methods such as smoking, roasting, and baking. However, thanks to improvements in construction and advancements in digital controllers, modern pellet grills can produce higher temperatures. Whereas early units struggled to reach 450 °F, some pellet grills can now easily achieve temperatures in excess of 550 °F. Louisiana Grills, Fast Eddy's by Cookshack, and Yoder Smokers YS Series have pellet grills with an upper limit of 600 °F. Some pellet grills can reach 600-700 °F, depending on the model. The ability to achieve high temperatures has enabled some manufacturers to design pellet grills that can handle both indirect and direct cooking. Brands such as Memphis Wood Fire Grills, Fast Eddy’s by Cookshack, Louisiana Grills, Yoder Smokers, and FireCraft make pellet grills that offer the option of open fire grilling.31 This is usually accomplished through a removable or adjustable plate that allows flames through {{a portion of the}} pellet grill's <b>deflector</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
5|$|Smoke-lifting {{devices were}} not a {{priority}} with the normal single-chimney Pacifics. However, with its double chimney and subsequent fitting of a double Kylchap exhaust in 1937, Humorist continued to pose a problem in this regard and always had small wings {{on either side of}} the chimney. Finally, in the 1950s, it acquired the Peppercorn-type of <b>deflector</b> <b>plates.</b>|$|R
50|$|On the {{condensing}} locomotive, spent steam was recycled and condensed back {{to water}} for repeated use. Since the steam wasn't expelled up the chimney, the Class 25's smokebox contained a steam turbine-driven fan beneath the chimney {{to keep the}} draught going, with <b>deflector</b> <b>plates</b> {{that were supposed to}} prevent char from causing excessive wear on the fan blades.|$|R

50|$|Joe Traeger {{developed}} the Traeger pellet grill in 1985 and patented it in 1986. The first Traeger Grills began production in 1988 and {{were introduced to}} a public that {{had never seen anything}} like them. Early Traeger Grills didn’t look all that different from traditional offset smokers with the exception of a side-mounted hopper where the firebox would typically be. However, the internal workings of the grill were unlike anything else on the market. For starters, Traeger Grills were electric and controlled by a simple three-position switch. Like the pellet stove, a rotating auger fed pellets from the hopper to the fire pot, where they were lit by an igniter rod. A fan then stoked the fire and distributed heat and smoke throughout the grill. A metal plate, called the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate,</b> sat between the fire and the grill grate, keeping food and grease from coming in contact with the flames and preventing flare-ups.|$|E
50|$|This {{designation}} {{was given}} to upgraded vehicles of the first batch of Leopard 2s, brought up to the standard of {{the second and third}} batches. This modernisation gradually replaced the original PZB 200 sights in the first batch with thermal sights for the EMES 15 as they became available. Furthermore, the upgrade included the fitting of filler openings and caps to the forward hull fuel tanks to allow separate refuelling, as well as the addition of a <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> for the periscope and a large coverplate to protect the existing NBC protection system. Finally, the tank was given new five metre towing cables with a different position. The programme began in 1984 and ended in 1987; the third, fourth and fifth batches were during this period produced with the same features. The modernised first batch can be recognised by the circular plate covering the hole where the cross-wind sensor for the fire-control system was removed.|$|E

40|$|A {{prototype}} pulser, which incorporates thirty-two 1 kV Field-Effect Transistor (FET) modules, {{has been}} built and tested at TRIUMF. The pulser has been developed for application in a scheme for pulsed extraction from the TRIUMF 500 MeV cyclotron. Deflection of the beam will be provided by an electric field between a set of 1 in long <b>deflector</b> <b>plates.</b> The pulser generates a continuous, unipolar, pulse train at a fundamental frequency of approximately 1 MHz and a magnitude of 10 kV. The pulses have 38 ns rise and fall times and are stored on a low-loss coaxial cable which interconnects the pulse generator and the <b>deflector</b> <b>plates.</b> The circuit performance was evaluated {{with the aid of}} PSpice in the design stage and confirmed by measurements on the prototype. Temperature measurements have been performed on 1 kV FET modules under DC conditions and compared with temperatures under operating conditions to ensure that switching losses are acceptable. Results of various measurements are presented and compared with simulations...|$|R
2500|$|The M2's {{features}} {{included an}} unusually large number of machine guns, bullet <b>deflector</b> <b>plates,</b> and sloped armor on the hull front (glacis plate). The main armament was a [...] gun, with [...] armor; the M2A1 had a [...] gun mantlet.

50|$|In response, the Rhodesians co-operated {{with the}} South Africans {{to develop a}} range of mine {{protected}} vehicles. They began by replacing air in tyres with water which absorbed some of the blast and reduced {{the heat of the}} explosion. Initially, they protected the bodies with steel <b>deflector</b> <b>plates,</b> sandbags and mine conveyor belting. Later, purpose built vehicles with V shaped blast hulls dispersed the blast and deaths in such vehicles became unusual events.|$|R
50|$|There were no {{machine guns}} in the {{sponsons}}, only the 6-pounders each manned by a gunner and loader. The side machine guns were {{to the rear of}} the sponsons mounted in the hull doors. Major Alden had designed the sponsons to be retractable (they could be swung in at the rear by the crew, being pivoted at the front), to reduce the width of the vehicle if enemy obstacles were encountered. Five more machine guns were in the superstructure: two at the front—left and right next to the driver—and one on each of the other sides. As there was no machine gun position covering the back of the tank there was a dead angle vulnerable to infantry attack. To solve this problem a triangular steel <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> was attached. The rear superstructure machine gunner could use it to deflect his fire down into that area behind the tank. The tank carried 208 shells and 13,848 machine gun rounds, mostly in a large ammunition locker in the centre which formed a platform on which the commander stood behind the driver observing the battlefield through a cupola with four vision slits. Later the side superstructure guns were removed on US tanks.|$|E
5000|$|Few other {{railways}} adopted this firebox; but the South Eastern's close neighbour, the London, Chatham & Dover Railway (LCDR), used {{it between}} 1861 and 1869 for 68 of their engines, whilst {{it was also}} used by their other neighbour, the London, Brighton & South Coast Railway. The LCDR also found the firebox expensive: some locomotives ordered in July 1860 were costed at £150 extra (equivalent to £ in [...] ) for the Cudworth firebox with 8 ft grate; and when a revised order was prepared in February 1861, with a 6 ft grate, the firebox was costed at £20 less (equivalent to £ in [...] ) than the 1860 order. In February 1868, the LCDR's Locomotive Superintendent, William Martley, replaced the Cudworth firebox of one locomotive with a different design of coal-burning firebox (one with a brick arch and <b>deflector</b> <b>plate,</b> which had been developed by the Midland Railway), which had fewer complicated joints. In April 1869 he reported that the Cudworth type cost £23-2-3d per year (equivalent to £ in [...] ) in maintenance, whilst the type with a brick arch cost £4-18-6d (equivalent to £ in [...] ), and as a result, he gave instructions for the replacement of all Cudworth fireboxes when the locomotives next became due for heavy repairs. Between 1869 and 1876, all LCDR locomotives which had been fitted with the Cudworth firebox had these replaced by the brick-arch type, which was not only cheaper to maintain but had lower first cost.|$|E
40|$|This paper summarises the two part work {{carried out}} during project 7 of work package 3 of the EU funded {{research}} project AMEDEO. At first, {{the outcome of}} a practical application and extension of a numerical coupled FEA-CFD methodology is presented. Extensive use is made of FEA (solids) and CFD (fluid) modelling techniques to understand the thermo-mechanical behaviour of a turbine stator well cavity, due to the interaction of cooling air supply with the main annulus. In this investigation, two different geometries (baseline and a <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> design) with a specific amount of cooling air are modelled and the impact of the structural deflections on the heat transfer is investigated. The second part focuses on a CFD-based automated optimisation of a turbine stator well (TSW) geometry with an included stationary <b>deflector</b> <b>plate.</b> Experiments as well as numerical simulations have shown that due to the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> the cooling flow is fed more directly into the disc boundary layer, allowing more effective use of less cooling air, leading to improved engine efficiency. Therefore, the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> geometry is embedded in an automated optimisation loop to further reduce the amount of cooling air. The optimisation strategy concentrates on a flexible design parameterisation of the cavity geometry with <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> and its implementation in an automatic 3 D meshing system. The parameterised geometry is optimised using a metamodel-assisted approach based on regressing Kriging in order to identify the optimum position and orientation of the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> inside the cavity...|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of <b>deflector</b> <b>plates</b> {{to the back}} of propellers by French pilot Roland Garros and designer Raymond Saulnier in the Morane-Saulnier monoplane was the first example of an aircraft able to fire through its propeller, permitting Garros to score three victories in April 1915. Dutch aircraft designer Anthony Fokker developed a successful gun synchronizer in 1915, resulting in German Leutnant Kurt Wintgens scoring the first known victory for a synchronized gun-equipped fighter aircraft, on July 1, 1915.|$|R
2500|$|On March 28, 2014, the NHTSA {{announced}} that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S design was making the electric car prone to catch fire, after the automaker said it would provide more protection to its lithium-ion batteries. According to the NHTSA, the titanium underbody shield and aluminum <b>deflector</b> <b>plates,</b> along with increased ground clearance, reduce the severity, frequency, and fire risk of underbody strikes. All Model S cars manufactured after March 6 have the [...] aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield {{designed to protect the}} battery and charging circuitry from being punctured even in very high speed impacts. The new shielding features a hollow aluminum tube to deflect impacting objects, a titanium shield to protect sensitive components from puncture damage, and an aluminum extrusion to absorb impact energy. The new shields, which decrease vehicle range by 0.1%, will be installed free-of-charge in existing Model S vehicles by request or during the next scheduled maintenance. According to the NHTSA, the titanium underbody shield and aluminum <b>deflector</b> <b>plates,</b> along with increased ground clearance, [...] "should reduce both the frequency of underbody strikes and the resultant fire risk." ...|$|R

40|$|Savonius rotor is a {{vertical}} axis rotor with simple {{in design and}} easy to fabricate at lower cost. The rotation of the rotor {{is due to the}} drag difference between the advancing blade and returning blade. Net driving force can be increased by reducing the reverse force on the returning blade or increasing the positive force on the advancing blade. Former can be realized by providing a flow obstacle to the returning blade and latter can be realized by concentrating the flow towards the advancing blade. The objective of the present work is to identify the optimal position of the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> (on advancing blade side) placed upstream to the flow which would result in increase in power generated by the rotor. Tests are conducted to identify the optimum position of the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> on the advancing blade side {{in the presence of a}} <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> on the returning blade side at its optimum position. Results suggest that two deflector plates placed at their optimal positions upstream to the flow increase the coefficient of power to 0. 35. This is significantly higher than the coefficient of power of 0. 14 observed for the rotor without deflector plates...|$|E
40|$|At present, it is {{a common}} {{practice}} to expose engine components to main annulus air temperatures exceeding the thermal material limit in order to increase the overall engine performance and to minimize the engine specific fuel consumption. To prevent overheating of the materials and thus the reduction of component life, an internal flow system is required to cool and protect the critical engine parts. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} insertion of a <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> in turbine cavities leads to a more effective use of reduced cooling air, since the coolant is fed more effectively into the disk boundary layer. This paper describes a flexible design parameterization of an engine representative turbine stator well geometry with stationary <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> and its implementation within an automated design optimization process using automatic meshing and steady-state computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Special attention and effort is turned to the flexibility of the parameterization method in order to reduce the number of design variables to a minimum on the one hand, but increasing the design space flexibility and generality on the other. Finally, the optimized design is evaluated using a previously validated conjugate heat transfer method (by coupling a finite element analysis (FEA) to CFD) and compared against both the nonoptimized deflector design and a reference baseline design without a <b>deflector</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|E
40|$|It is {{possible}} to produce concentrated free surface water jets by rapidly accelerating a geometrically shaped curved <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> below the free water surface. This principle has been established using a self focusing electromagnetic acoustic source (FEMAS) and this report verifies it using a shock tube based mechanical analogue of that system. The shape, form and speed o f the water jets produced vary between the two systems. Discrete pressure measurements using a needle hydrophone positioned at different points below the free water surface are presented. The variation in pressure amplitudes recorded highlight the scatter and uncertainty inherent in a complex coupled system, while the form o f the pressure trace is dependant on the mechanical design o f the system in use and the position o f the needle hydrophone in the pressure field. To better understand the experimental system, a computer simulation using commercially availa ble non-linear dynamic analysis software has been developed. This shows that the water surface jets result from the overall hydrodynamic, flow initiated by rapid movement o f the <b>deflector</b> <b>plate</b> below the water surface...|$|E
