5|$|A {{scheme was}} devised during the Second World War to protect major cities from enemy bombing by {{lighting}} <b>decoy</b> fires on nearby open land. Manchester {{was protected by}} four of these Starfish sites as they were known, two of them on Chat Moss.

Each consisted of an air raid shelter for the crew along with various devices to simulate street lighting and the explosions of incendiary bombs. The effectiveness of the <b>decoy</b> sites is uncertain, and they were closed in 1943.|$|E

5|$|HMS <b>Decoy</b> was a D-class {{destroyer}} of the Royal Navy. Ordered in 1931, {{the ship}} was constructed by John I. Thornycroft & Company, and entered naval service in 1933. <b>Decoy</b> was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before she {{was transferred to the}} China Station in early 1935. She was temporarily deployed in the Red Sea during late 1935 during the Abyssinia Crisis, before returning to her duty station where she remained until mid-1939. <b>Decoy</b> was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet just before the Second World War began in September 1939. She briefly was assigned to West Africa for convoy escort duties in 1940 before returning to the Mediterranean. The ship participated in the Battles of Calabria without significant damage and escorted ships of the Mediterranean Fleet for {{most of the rest of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|The four {{ships that}} {{remained}} with the Mediterranean Fleet sank three Italian submarines in 1940 while escorting Malta convoys and larger warships of the fleet. Several {{participated in the}} Battles of Calabria and Cape Spartivento that year. Duncan joined Force H at Gibraltar in October and escorted that group. Dainty was sunk by German bombers in February 1941 and Diamond in April while evacuating Allied personnel from Greece. Defender had to be scuttled in July when she was crippled by a German bomber when returning from escorting a convoy to Tobruk. Duncan and <b>Decoy</b> remained on escort duties {{for the rest of}} the year before being transferred to the Eastern Fleet in early 1942. They returned to the UK late in the year to begin conversions to escort destroyers. <b>Decoy</b> was transferred to the RCN in early 1943, but both became convoy escorts in the Atlantic. They sank two German submarines before being assigned to the UK to protect Allied shipping during Operation Overlord. They sank three more submarines before the end of the war and were paid off in 1945. Duncan was scrapped 1945–49 and <b>Decoy</b> during 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{merchant}} ship SS Mamari III was converted to resemble Hermes as a <b>decoy</b> ship {{to confuse the}} Axis where Hermes was actually operating. The superstructure was mainly a wooden mock-up. She {{was a part of}} the phantom fleet of mock-up British warships designated as Fleet Tender C. On 4 June 1941, when she was sailing down the east coast of England to Chatham Dockyard in Kent to be converted back to a {{merchant ship}}, the <b>decoy</b> Hermes hit a submerged wreck and ran aground off Norfolk during a German aerial attack. Before being refloated she was totally disabled by German E-boats commanded by Niels Bätge. The Germans initially thought they had sunk an aircraft carrier.|$|E

50|$|Accurate AOA is also {{important}} in deciding the dispensing direction of the counter measure <b>decoys</b> (flares). It is vital to avoid the situation where the platform and the dispensed <b>decoys</b> both remain within the {{instantaneous field of view}} (IFoV) of incoming missiles. In situations like that missiles could very well, once they pass the <b>decoys,</b> still hit the platform. This is of particular importance where separation between the <b>decoys</b> and the platform takes too long {{as is the case with}} slow flying aircraft.|$|R
5|$|The {{navigation}} then {{passes to}} the east of Southampton Airport, while further east is the river channel and the Itchen Valley Country Park. Between the two waterways is <b>Decoy</b> Covert, a small wood which contained a duck <b>decoy.</b> The lock nearby is called <b>Decoy</b> Pond Lock, below which is Sandy Lock. There is little water in this section, since its main supply has been cut off, and although there are springs along this section, the channel is periodically blocked where occupation bridges have been replaced by earth embankments. Sandy Lock has much barbed wire in it, possibly dumped when the wartime defences of the airport were dismantled. The final lock on this section is Mans Bridge Lock, shortly after the modern crossing by the M27 motorway. The cut then rejoins the main river, and passes under the A27 road. The current bridge was constructed in 1975, and replaced a bailey bridge erected during the Second World War. Just below it is a single arched stone bridge dating from the early nineteenth century, which was the original course of the road. It has been restored and is used as a footbridge.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of war, <b>Decoy</b> {{was assigned to the}} Mediterranean Fleet and assigned to contraband control duties. In December the ship began an extensive refit to repair corrosion problems, fix her boiler feedwater pumps, and replace her funnels. After completing her repairs in January 1940, she was transferred to Freetown, joining the 20th Destroyer Flotilla, to escort convoys off the West African coast. <b>Decoy</b> returned to the Mediterranean Fleet in May and was assigned to the 10th Destroyer Flotilla. Together with her sister , she escorted Convoy US-2 carrying Australian and New Zealand troops to the Middle East through the Red Sea from 12 to 17 May.|$|E
5|$|After rescuing the Queen, Flik deploys the bird; it {{initially}} fools the grasshoppers, but P.T. Flea, also mistaking {{it for a}} real bird, burns it, exposing it as a <b>decoy.</b> Hopper beats Flik {{in retaliation}} and says that the ants are humble and lowly life forms who live to serve the grasshoppers. However, Flik responds that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of, inspiring the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers. The ants attempt to force Hopper out of Ant Island, but it suddenly begins to rain. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper kidnaps Flik and flees. After the Circus Bugs fail to catch them, Atta rescues Flik. As Hopper pursues them, Flik lures him to the nest of the bird he, Dot, and the Circus Bugs encountered earlier. Thinking that the bird is another <b>decoy,</b> Hopper taunts it before discovering it is real, and is captured and fed to its chicks.|$|E
50|$|The most renowned {{discovery}} at Lovelock Cave was a {{cache of}} eleven duck <b>decoys.</b> M.R. Harrington and L.L.

The cache included eight painted and feathered <b>decoys</b> and three unfinished <b>decoys.</b> Items found in the same pit consisted of feathers and two bundles of animal traps. The remarkable <b>decoys</b> were made from bundled tule, a long grass-like herb, covered in feathers and painted.|$|R
40|$|Near-native {{selections}} from docking <b>decoys</b> have proved challenging especially when unbound proteins {{are used in}} the molecular docking. One reason is that significant atomic clashes in docking <b>decoys</b> lead to poor predictions of binding affinities of near native <b>decoys.</b> Atomic clashes can be removed by structural refinement through energy minimization. Such an energy minimization, however, will lead to an unrealistic bias toward docked structures with large interfaces. Here, we extend an empirical energy function developed for protein design to protein–protein docking selection by introducing a simple reference state that removes the unrealistic dependence of binding affinity of docking <b>decoys</b> on the buried solvent accessible surface area of interface. The energy function called EMPIRE (EMpirical Protein-InteRaction Energy), when coupled with a refinement strategy, is found to provide a significantly improved success rate in near native selections when applied to RosettaDock and refined ZDOCK docking <b>decoys.</b> Our work underlines the importance of removing nonspecific interactions from specific ones in near native {{selections from}} docking <b>decoys...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audiencePermanent female mimicry, {{in which}} adult males express a female phenotype, is known only from two bird species. A likely benefit of female mimicry is reduced intrasexual competition, {{allowing}} female-like males to access breeding resources while avoiding costly fights with typical territorial males. We tested this hypothesis {{in a population}} of marsh harriers Circus aeruginosus in which approximately 40 per cent of sexually mature males exhibit a permanent, i. e. lifelong, female plumage phenotype. Using simulated territorial intrusions, we measured aggressive responses of breeding males towards conspecific <b>decoys</b> of females, female-like males and typical males. We show that aggressive responses varied with both the type of <b>decoys</b> {{and the type of}} defending male. Typical males were aggressive towards typical male <b>decoys</b> more than they were towards female-like male decoys; female-like male <b>decoys</b> were attacked at a rate similar to that of female <b>decoys.</b> By contrast, female-like males tolerated male <b>decoys</b> (both typical and female-like) and directed their aggression towards female <b>decoys.</b> Thus, agonistic responses were intrasexual in typical males but intersexual in female-like males, indicating that the latter not only look like females but also behave like them when defending breeding resources. When intrasexual aggression is high, permanent female mimicry is arguably adaptive and could be seen as a permanent 'non-aggression pact' with other males...|$|R

5|$|Some of {{the species}} in the {{freshwater}} mussel family, Unionidae, commonly known as pocketbook mussels, have evolved an unusual reproductive strategy. The female's mantle protrudes from the shell and develops into an imitation small fish, complete with fish-like markings and false eyes. This <b>decoy</b> moves in the current and attracts the attention of real fish. Some fish see the <b>decoy</b> as prey, while others see a conspecific. They approach {{for a closer look}} and the mussel releases huge numbers of larvae from its gills, dousing the inquisitive fish with its tiny, parasitic young. These glochidia larvae are drawn into the fish's gills, where they attach and trigger a tissue response that forms a small cyst around each larva. The larvae then feed by breaking down and digesting the tissue of the fish within the cysts. After a few weeks they release themselves from the cysts and fall to the stream bed as juvenile molluscs. The fish are relatively unharmed.|$|E

5|$|The year of 1967 started {{badly for}} the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF). During {{the early years}} of the war, the rules of {{engagement}} prevented U.S. fighter-bombers from hitting North Vietnamese air bases, and that allowed North Vietnamese fighter pilots to attack American bomber formations as they were approaching their targets, thereby forcing U.S. pilots to jettison their bomb loads before they even reached their target. Then, instead of dueling with U.S. strike aircraft, North Vietnamese pilots would normally retreat to the safety of their bases. To preempt further attacks on U.S. bomber formations by the North Vietnamese Air Force, the United States Air Force became interested in luring North Vietnamese MiG fighters up against a <b>decoy</b> target, and shoot them down in the air using missile-armed fighter aircraft. By 1967, the North Vietnamese Air Force had become more aggressive towards U.S. strike formations, and it indicated to U.S. commanders that it was the right time to launch a <b>decoy</b> operation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} the target searching problems with {{a new type of}} the object: <b>decoys</b> which can be sensed exactly as targets but cannot be collected by the robots. In real-life applications, <b>decoys</b> are very common especially for swarm robots whose hardware should be designed as simple and cheap as possible. This inevitably brings errors and mistakes in the sensing results and the swarm may mistakenly sense certain kinds of environment objects as the target they are looking for. We proposed a simple cooperative strategy to solve this problem, comparing with a non-cooperative strategy as the baseline. The strategies work with other searching algorithms and provide schemes for avoiding <b>decoys.</b> Simulation results demonstrate that the cooperative strategy shares almost the same computation overload yet has better performance in iterations and especially visited times of <b>decoys.</b> The strategy shows great adaptiveness to large scale problems and performs better when more <b>decoys</b> or robots exist in the simulation.
