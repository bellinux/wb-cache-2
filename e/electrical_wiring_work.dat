50|$|Totley Grange was a {{manor house}} near Totley's Cross Sythes pub. It {{was built in}} 1875 by Ebenezer Hall. He had bought the land from Mr. Parker who had bought it from George B. Greaves. Thomas Earnshaw, a fish and game dealer {{lived in the house}} around the 1890s which gave the house the {{nickname}} of Fish Villa.During the 1939 to 1945 war, some kind of <b>electrical</b> <b>wiring</b> <b>work</b> was carried out in The Grange by local women.In 1965, work begun on the construction of Totley Grange Estate. Workmen found well lining stones which from the findings could have held water sufficient to feed flora from large greenhouses and gardens.|$|E

Apprentices see deadlines within the workplace as real and as affecting {{the viability of the}} firm and its jobs, unlike the artificial deadlines set by teachers. Apprentices learn from mentors to take pride in their work; Rose (2004) points to electrical apprentices who emulate their instructors’ pride in laying proper <b>electrical</b> <b>wiring</b> though the <b>work</b> will never be seen. Apprentices aspire to mastery in an occupation and becoming part of a community of practice.|$|R
2500|$|Copper is the {{electrical}} conductor in many categories of <b>electrical</b> <b>wiring.</b> Copper wire {{is used in}} power generation, power transmission, power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment. Copper and its alloys are also used to make electrical contacts. [...] <b>Electrical</b> <b>wiring</b> in buildings {{is the most important}} market for the copper industry.

50|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>wiring</b> {{practices}} {{developed in}} parallel {{in many countries}} in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a result, national and regional variations developed and remain in effect. (see National <b>Electrical</b> Code, <b>electrical</b> <b>wiring,</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>wiring</b> in the United Kingdom). Some of these are retained for technical reasons, since the safety of wiring systems depends {{not only on the}} wiring code but also on the technical standards for wiring devices, materials, and equipment.|$|R

40|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>wiring</b> and cables, in {{many cases}} buried deep, in many systems and environments suffer damage. In some cases the damage only affects wire {{insulation}} and is not usually detected under normal operating conditions. This study discusses computer modelling of <b>electrical</b> <b>wires,</b> based on time-domain reflectometry using trains of successive pulses which were used {{in order to develop}} techniques and test procedures that would lead to identification of these types of faults. This study shows detailed simulations of defects in insulation of <b>electrical</b> <b>wires</b> and in cable shields, using dedicated electromagnetic modelling computation software. The results of simulations were compared with those obtained in experimental measurement for wires and cables of several metres in length. Comparison of the analysed measurement results for this novel technique shows clear indication of its relevance to flaw detection in <b>electrical</b> <b>wires,</b> guided through simulation...|$|R

40|$|An <b>electrical</b> <b>wire</b> is {{reported}} along whose length loops are formed at intervals and retained {{in a plastic}} capsule that allows unfolding of the loop when tension is exerted on the {{opposite ends of the}} wire. The capsule is formed by encompassing each loop with a sleeve of heat shrinkable synthetic plastic material which overlaps the loop and heat shrinking the overlapping portions. Thus, a length of <b>electrical</b> <b>wire</b> is formed which stores extra lengths of wire in the quantity needed to match the expected stretching of materials or elements such as ropes, cords and the like of high elongation to which the <b>electrical</b> <b>wire</b> may be attached...|$|R

40|$|A few {{previous}} {{reports have}} described cases wherein <b>electrical</b> <b>wire</b> cables were {{inserted into the}} male urethra and bladder. <b>Electrical</b> <b>wire</b> cables are available at home and are easy to insert. However, after they coil in the patient’s bladder, they are difficult to remove. In February 2013, a 30 -year-old man presented {{to the emergency room}} of SMG-SNU Boramae Medical Center with a urethral foreign body. He had inserted an <b>electrical</b> <b>wire</b> cable into his urethra for the purpose of masturbation, despite having a regular sex partner and no underlying disease. A kidney-ureter-bladder radiography showed a tangled wire in his bladder and urethra. On the next day, we tried to remove the wire cystoscopically, but this proved to be impossible because of complex coiling and the slippery surface of the wire. A Pfannenstiel incision was made to remove the foreign body. No postoperative complications were noted. Key Words: Foreign bodies; Masturbation; Urinary bladder There have been some case reports of <b>electrical</b> <b>wire</b> ca-bles inserted into the male urethra and bladder [1 - 10]. <b>Electrical</b> <b>wire</b> cables are available at home and are easy to insert. Their clinical significance is that after coiling in one’s bladder, they are difficult to remove. This case re-port describes a Korean man who underwent open surger...|$|R
