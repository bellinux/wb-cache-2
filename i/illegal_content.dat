5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{access to}} <b>illegal</b> <b>content</b> (such as child pornography) was {{strictly}} self-regulated by individual internet service providers. This began when BT Group introduced Cleanfeed, a server-side filtering system which uses {{data obtained from}} the Internet Watch Foundation. The IWF is a Quango organisation that operates a website where users can report web pages containing illegal or dubious content {{to be added to}} their blacklists. This was implemented in order to prevent users from accessing this material, since it is illegal to possess an indecent image of a child under the age of 18 per the Protection of Children Act. British ISPs were later obligated by the government to implement filters for <b>illegal</b> <b>content</b> by the beginning of 2007.|$|E
25|$|It is, however, {{legal to}} possess RC films and games - for people over 18 (except in Western Australia and {{certain parts of}} the Northern Territory), unless they contain <b>illegal</b> <b>content</b> (e.g. child pornography). The content is very high in impact.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{development}} of modern peer-to-peer sharing systems and home broadband service, sharing warez sometimes involved warez groups scanning the Internet for weakly secured computer systems with high-speed connections. These weakly secured systems would be compromised by exploiting the poor FTP security, creating a special directory on the server with an unassuming name to contain the <b>illegal</b> <b>content.</b>|$|E

25|$|Previously, the IWF {{passed on}} {{notifications}} of suspected child pornography hosted on non-UK servers to the UK National Criminal Intelligence Service {{which in turn}} forwards it to Interpol or the relevant foreign police authority. It now works with the Serious Organised Crime Agency instead. The IWF does not, however, pass on notifications {{of other types of}} potentially <b>illegal</b> <b>content</b> hosted outside the UK.|$|E
25|$|Some of the BBSes that {{provided}} access to <b>illegal</b> <b>content</b> faced opposition. On July 12, 1985, {{in conjunction with}} a credit card fraud investigation, the Middlesex County, NJ Sheriff's department raided and seized The Private Sector BBS, which was the official BBS for grey hat hacker quarterly 2600 Magazine at the time. The notorious Rusty n Edie's BBS, in Boardman, Ohio, was raided by the FBI in January 1993 for trading unlicensed software, and later sued by Playboy for copyright infringement in November 1997. In Flint, Michigan, a 21-year-old man was charged with distributing child pornography through his BBS in March 1996.|$|E

However, an agreement between Blackberry's developer Research in Motion and UAE's telecom regulator has been reached, and the announced BlackBerry services suspension has been canceled.|$|E
50|$|In Italy in 2009, the {{discovery}} of pro-mafia groups, one of them claiming Bernardo Provenzano's sainthood, caused an alert {{in the country and}} brought the government to rapidly issue a law that would force Internet service providers to deny access to entire websites in case of refused removal of <b>illegal</b> <b>contents.</b> The amendment was passed by the Italian Senate and now needs to be passed unchanged by the Chamber of Deputies to become effective.|$|R

25|$|In 2006, Home Office {{minister}} Alan Campbell {{pledged that}} all ISPs would block access to child abuse websites {{by the end}} of 2007. By the middle of 2006 the government reported that 90% of domestic broadband connections were either currently blocking or had plans to {{by the end of}} the year. The target for 100% coverage was set for the end of 2007, however in the middle of 2008 it stood at 95%. In February 2009, the Government said that it is looking at ways to cover the final 5%. In an interview in March 2009, a Home Office spokesperson mistakenly thought that the IWF deleted <b>illegal</b> <b>content,</b> and didn't look at the content they rate.|$|E
25|$|Establishing the {{identity}} of the person posting <b>illegal</b> <b>content</b> is equally difficult due to the trust-based design of the network. Like SMTP email, servers generally assume the header and origin information in a post is true and accurate. However, as in SMTP email, Usenet post headers are easily falsified so as to obscure the true identity and location of the message source. In this manner, Usenet is significantly different from modern P2P services; most P2P users distributing content are typically immediately identifiable to all other users by their network address, but the origin information for a Usenet posting can be completely obscured and unobtainable once it has propagated past the original server.|$|E
25|$|The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA) are {{bills that}} were {{introduced}} into the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate {{in the last quarter}} of 2011. Both are responses to the problem of enforcement of U.S. laws against websites outside U.S. jurisdiction. While the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and other existing laws have generally been considered effective against <b>illegal</b> <b>content</b> or activities on U.S.-based sites, action is more difficult against overseas websites. SOPA and PIPA proposed to rectify this by cutting off infringing sites from their U.S. based funding (particularly advertising), payment processors, appearances on search engines, and visibility on web browsers, instead. Major providers of all these services are predominantly U.S. based. Notably, the provisions also involved modifying the DNS system, a crucial service that underpins the entire Internet and allows computers to locate each other reliably around the world.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Despite the {{increasing}} number of e-music downloads and the large use of mobile devices, the mobile music market is slowly taking off. Prices seem to be the main burden: compared to the wired environment, a song is twice or three times more expensive. Furthermore, mobile network transfer data rate causes the download time to be very long. In this paper we propose Bluemusic, a multi channel architecture that couples the usage of the mobile phone network with the free-of-charge communication technologies provided in cellphones (e. g., bluetooth or Wi-Fi) to distribute music in the mobile environment. To protect digital contents, Bluemusic is provided with a security mechanism that prevents <b>illegal</b> <b>contents</b> distribution. An evaluation of our approach shows that Bluemusic can be helpful to the expansion of the mobile music market. ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{essential}} {{factors have}} {{lead to the}} success of Peer-to-Peer-systems (P 2 P). Some of this factors are the scalability and the fault tolerance of such systems. With their decentralized architecture P 2 P-filesharingsystems offer many additional advantages which should not be left out of consideration. A few advantages are, that they neither have a Single-Point-of-Failure nor do they create bottlenecks. P 2 P-systems gained high popularity especially through millions of media downloads provided by online music exchange services like Napster. However the P 2 P-based online exchange services are often used to distribute <b>illegal</b> <b>contents.</b> The violation of copyrights create additional challenges for the legal owner of the files but also for the consumers. The CONFU©CO system considers several aspects for distinguishing itself from existing filesharing systems. One important aim is to take the interests of the file owners and the consumers into account. The users can in this way explore the full functionality, without any restrictions, of P 2 P-systems in order to exchange and view multimedia-contents {{and at the same time}} guarantee the legal ownership not being violated. The platform-independent CONFUO©O-System is based on a hybrid P 2 P-architecture. For the realization of communication and file-exchange services an existing P 2 P-framework has been used and modified. Through the use of special checksums (fingerprinting) only authorized contents can be shared in the system. Users are personally responsible for the use and exchange of <b>illegal</b> <b>contents.</b> The distribution of multimedia-content can be controlled any time by the owner of the file. In order to make sure that the legal ownership of a file is not violated and misused, a trusted and independent controlling instance (TTP, Trusted Third Party) needs to be implemented. Load-balancing and failover of the TTP are provided by a distributed approach. The implemented TTP guarantees a high degree of flexibility, reuseability and scalability.
