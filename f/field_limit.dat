2500|$|Tests {{of general}} {{relativity}} serve to establish observational evidence for the theory {{of general relativity}}. The first three tests, proposed by Einstein in 1915, concerned the [...] "anomalous" [...] precession of the perihelion of Mercury, the bending of light in gravitational fields, and the gravitational redshift. The precession of Mercury was already known; experiments showing light bending {{in line with the}} predictions of general relativity was found in 1919, with increasing precision measurements done in subsequent tests, and astrophysical measurement of the gravitational redshift was claimed to be measured in 1925, although measurements sensitive enough to actually confirm the theory were not done until 1954. A program of more accurate tests starting in 1959 tested the various predictions of general relativity with a further degree of accuracy in the weak gravitational <b>field</b> <b>limit,</b> severely limiting possible deviations from the theory.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{feature of}} Nordström's {{theory is that}} it can be written as the theory of a certain scalar field in Minkowski spacetime, and in this form enjoys the {{expected}} conservation law for nongravitational mass-energy together with gravitational field energy, but suffers from a not very memorable force law. [...] In the curved spacetime formulation the motion of test particles is described (the world line of a free test particle is a timelike geodesic, and by an obvious limit, the world line of a laser pulse is a null geodesic), but we lose the conservation law. [...] So which interpretation is correct? [...] In other words, which metric is the one which according to Nordström can be measured locally by physical experiments? [...] The answer is: the curved spacetime is the physically observable one in this theory (as in all metric theories of gravitation); the flat background is a mere mathematical fiction which is however of inestimable value for such purposes as writing down the general vacuum solution, or studying the weak <b>field</b> <b>limit.</b>|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} to realize that the Einstein field equations alone are not enough to determine the evolution of a gravitational system in many cases. They depend on the stress-energy tensor, which depends on the dynamics of matter and energy (such as trajectories of moving particles), which in turn depends on the gravitational field. If one is only interested in the weak <b>field</b> <b>limit</b> of the theory, the dynamics of matter can be computed using special relativity methods and/or Newtonian laws of gravity and then the resulting stress-energy tensor can be plugged into the Einstein field equations. But if the exact solution is required or a solution describing strong fields, the evolution of the metric and the stress-energy tensor must be solved for together.|$|E
