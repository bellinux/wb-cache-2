5000|$|A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>{{manifold}}</b> is a manifold {{that regulates}} fluid flow between pumps and actuators and other components in a hydraulic system. It {{is like a}} switchboard in an electrical circuit because it lets the operator control how much fluid flows between which components of a hydraulic machinery. For example, in a backhoe loader a manifold turns on or shuts off or diverts flow to the telescopic arms of the front bucket and the back bucket. The manifold {{is connected to the}} levers in the operator's cabin which the operator uses to achieve the desired manifold behaviour.|$|E
40|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>manifolds</b> {{are used}} to realize compact circuit layout, but may {{introduce}} a high pressure drop in the system. Their design is in fact oriented more toward achieving minimum size and weight than to reducing pressure losses. This work studies the pressure losses in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>manifolds</b> using different methods: Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis; semi-empirical formulation derived from the scientific literature, when available; and experimental characterization. The purpose is to obtain the pressure losses when the channels' connections within the manifold are not ascribable to the few classic cases studied in the literature, in particular for 90 ° bends (elbows) with expansion/contraction and offset intersection of channels. Moreover, since CFD analysis is used to predict pressure losses, general considerations of the manifold design may be outlined and this will help the design process in the optimization of flow passages. The main results obtained show how CFD analysis overestimates the experimental results; nevertheless, the numerical analysis represents the correct trends of the pressure losses...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>manifolds</b> {{are used}} to realize compact circuit layouts, but may {{introduce}} high pressure losses in the system because their design is usually oriented to achieving minimum size and weight more than reducing the pressure losses. The purpose of this work is to obtain the pressure losses when the internal connections within the manifold are creating complex paths for the fluid and the total loss cannot be calculated simply as {{the sum of the}} single losses. To perform the analysis both Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analysis and experimental tests have been executed. After the comparison between numerical and experimental results, it was possible to assess that the numerical analysis developed in this work is able to depict the correct trends of the pressure losses also when complex fluid path are realized in the manifold. Successively, the numerical analysis was used to calculate the pressure loss for inclined connections of channels (or V-bends), a solution that is sometimes adopted in manifolds to meet the design requirements aimed towards the minimum room-minimum weight objective...|$|R

5000|$|A [...] Block and bleed {{manifold}} is a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>manifold</b> {{that combines}} {{one or more}} block/isolate valves, usually ball valves, and one or more bleed/vent valves, usually ball or needle valves, into one component for interface with other components (pressure measurement transmitters, gauges, switches, etc.) of a hydraulic (fluid) system. The purpose of the block and bleed manifold is to isolate or block the flow of fluid in the system so the fluid from upstream of the manifold does not reach other components {{of the system that}} are downstream. Then they bleed off or vent the remaining fluid from the system on the downstream side of the manifold. For example, a block and bleed manifold would be used to stop the flow of fluids to some component, then vent the fluid from that component’s side of the manifold, in order to effect some kind of work (maintenance/repair/replacement) on that component.|$|E

50|$|There {{were two}} self-contained, {{independent}} Hydraulic Power Units (HPUs) on each SRB. Each HPU consisted of an {{auxiliary power unit}} (APU), fuel supply module, hydraulic pump, hydraulic reservoir and <b>hydraulic</b> fluid <b>manifold</b> assembly. The APUs were fueled by hydrazine and generated mechanical shaft power to drive a hydraulic pump that produced hydraulic pressure for the SRB hydraulic system. The two separate HPUs and two hydraulic systems were located on the aft end of each SRB between the SRB nozzle and aft skirt. The HPU components were mounted on the aft skirt between the rock and tilt actuators. The two systems operated from T minus 28 seconds until SRB separation from the orbiter and external tank. The two independent hydraulic systems were connected to the rock and tilt servoactuators.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{a series}} of large scale {{repeated}} model load tests are performed on geocell reinforced and unreinforced base layers overlying weak sand subgrades. The weak sand subgrades are prepared at 30 % relative density (RD) through pluviation (sand raining) technique in a test tank of dimensions 1 m × 1 m × 1 m (length × width × height). Two different base courses consisting of 75 % RD sand and a granular base material have been tested. The 75 % RD sand base course is also prepared by pluviation technique, while the granular base course is prepared in 5 layers, each of 50 mm thick, by static compaction. A repetitive load of 0. 97 kN and 9. 7 kN was applied on the prepared base layer through a 150 mm diameter plate to replicate the traffic load equivalent to a contact pressure of 550 kPa. Loading was applied through a graphical user interfaced multi-purpose test software along {{with the help of}} a hydraulic power unit, <b>hydraulic</b> service <b>manifold</b> and sophisticated double acting linear dynamic 100 kN capacity actuator which is connected to a 3. 5 m high, 200 kN capacity reaction frame. Four different tests are conducted on both the base courses (75 % RD sand and granular base) with and without reinforcement overlying the weak sand subgrade separately. There is a considerable amount of improvement observed for different number of cycles and plate settlements on quantification of traffic benefit ratios (TBR), cumulative plastic deformations (CPD) and rut depth reduction (RDR) for geocell reinforced base courses. However, geocell reinforced granular base course have shown a better improvement comparatively...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{modelling}} {{method of}} dynamic flow path feature (DFPF) is {{proposed for the}} design process of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>manifold</b> block (HMB). In this method, temporary body model and B-Rep model are adopted to represent geometric model of DFPF; the former is used for showing flow path, checking connectivity and safe wall thickness, and the latter is used for saving the final results. A novel feature topological representation method based on solid adjacency graph (SAG) is provided, and then validity of feature semantics can be checked through SAG. Finally dynamic topological changeability of flow path feature is realized by constraint solution and knowledge driving. Object-oriented model of DFPF is given, and the design process of HMB based on DFPF is illustrated...|$|E
40|$|A seven-junction {{cooling water}} intake {{manifold}} was studied {{in a physical}} model and by <b>hydraulic</b> analysis. The <b>manifold,</b> {{also referred to as}} a "header", is one of four to be embedded in the bottom of Lake Michigan approximately 3500 ft offshore from the James H. Campbell Plant. Each header supports and collects water from seven dual screen intake risers (subject of a separate study). The primary objective {{of the study was to}} determine flow contribution from each of seven risers and piezometric pressures along the header. It was found that the flow rates ranged from 92 percent to 112 percent of the average flow per riser. To achieve a higher degree of uniformity, an analysis was made to determine how much additional headloss had to, be generated in each intake riser in order to produce identical withdrawal rates in all seven risers. A similar study was. Made for a partially balanced system where withdrawal rates would not fall outside the 95 to 105 percent limits. In that case, headloss generators were required in the two most downstream risers. Sharp edged nozzles were designed for Risers 6 and 7, and experimentally tested. The total piezometric pressure change through the partially balanced riser-manifold system at a total withdrawal rate of 206 cfs was determined to be 13. 8 inches of water relative to the lake. The total energy headloss between the lake and the downstream end of the manifold was determined to be 10. 7 inches of water.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a novel variable transmission {{system that is}} based on the concept of digital hydraulics. In the proposed system, sets of rolling-diaphragm cylinders are mounted via different effective lever arms to an input and output joint. A variable subset of these cylinders is connected via three-way two-position on/off valves to a common <b>hydraulic</b> <b>manifold.</b> This introduces a controllable constraint on the hydraulic flow and creates a programmable hydraulic transmission. With three single-acting cylinders, we could realize 37 different transmission ratios. We investigated the nonholonomic flow constraint analytically, in simulation, and with an experimental prototype. Using water as fluid, we show that a very stiff transmission (124. 2 Nm/rad) can be achieved within the range of ± 6 ◦. Theoretical transmission ratios are tracked with R-squared values of more than 0. 996 and backlash is smaller than 1. 4 %. Furthermore, we show the applicability of the proposed transmission in the simulation of a body-powered knee-ankle exoskeleton. I...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the design, {{fabrication}} and characterization of stackable microfluidic emulsion generators, with coefficients of variation as low as ~ 6 % and with production rates as high as ~ 1 L h- 1. This work reports the highest throughput {{reported in the literature}} for a microfluidic device with simultaneous operation of liquid-liquid droplet generators. The device was achieved by stacking several layers of 128 flow-focusing droplet generators, organized in a circular array. These layers are interconnected via through-holes and fed with designated fractal distribution networks. The proposed layers were milled on poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) sheets and the stack was thermo-compression bonded to create a three-dimensional device with a high density of generators and an integrated <b>hydraulic</b> <b>manifold.</b> The effect of stacking multiple layers was studied and the results show that fabrication accuracy has a greater impact on the dispersity of the emulsion than the addition of more layers to the stack. Particle crystallization of drugs was also demonstrated as a possible application of this technology in industry. © 2014 the Partner Organisations...|$|E
