These conditions were known for their characteristically <b>high</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> emissions predominantly from over-mixed and under-mixed mixture zones, respectively. The investigation was carried out to supplement current findings in the literature with valuable information on the formation of <b>high</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> emissions with increasing swirl levels generated by intake-port throttling. This was achieved through the use of cycle-resolved <b>high</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> measurements in addition to cycle averaged emissions and in-cylinder pressure-derived metrics. While there was negligible overall effect at the moderately dilute low-load conditions, increasing swirl {{has been shown to be}} beneficial to premixing efficacy under highly dilute conditions with extended ignition delay. This potential advantage was found to be nullified by the swirl-induced confinement of fuel and combustion products to the central region of the cylinder leading to poor late cycle burn rates and increased smoke emissions. <b>High</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> emissions from the squish and head quench regions were reduced by an increase in swirl ratio...|$|R
40|$|The {{hikes in}} {{hydrocarbon}} prices {{during the last}} years have lead to concern about investment choices in the energy system and uncertainty about the costs for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. On the one hand, high prices of {{oil and natural gas}} increase the use of coal; on the other hand, the cost difference between fossil-based energy and non-carbon energy options decreases. We use the global energy model TIMER to explore the energy system impacts of exogenously forced low, medium and <b>high</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> price scenarios, with and without climate policy. We find that without climate policy <b>high</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> prices drive electricity production from natural gas to coal. In the transport sector, <b>high</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> prices lead to the introduction of alternative fuels, especially biofuels and coal-based hydrogen. This leads to increased emissions of CO 2.

The compositional variability is of little consequence to the catalyst for most of the gases in the survey, including nearly all of the gases delivered in the U. S.
