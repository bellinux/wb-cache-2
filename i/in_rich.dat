5|$|A.viridimontanum is {{difficult}} to distinguish from its parent species in the field. It can generally be separated from A.pedatum by {{the shape of the}} ultimate segments (the smallest divisions of the leaf), and by its habitat on thin, exposed serpentine soils rather than <b>in</b> <b>rich</b> woodlands. It more closely resembles A.aleuticum; however, the stalks of the ultimate segments and the false indusia are longer and the spores larger.|$|E
5|$|Trillium grandiflorum is {{most common}} <b>in</b> <b>rich,</b> mixed upland forests. It is easily {{recognised}} by its attractive three-petaled white flowers, opening from late spring to early summer, that rise above a whorl of three, leaf-like bracts. It {{is an example}} of a spring ephemeral, a plant whose life-cycle is synchronised with that of the deciduous woodland which it favours.|$|E

In his uplifted right hand he holds a baton with a golden cap. He has a thick moustache and wears a high fur cap on which there is a golden chain with precious stones and a coat of arms in the center. From his ear a large pear-shaped pearl hangs from a golden pendant earring. He wears a reddish-brown mantle with a broad fur collar and, over it, a heavy gold chain from which the order of three horse tails, set <b>in</b> <b>rich</b> pendants, hangs on his right shoulder. A full light from the left falls {{on the right side of}} his face. The background is brownish-grey.|$|E

5|$|Bulbs {{offered for}} sale are {{referred}} to as either 'round' or 'double nose'. Round bulbs are circular in cross section and produce a single flower stem, while double nose bulbs have more than one bulb stem attached at the base and produce two or more flower stems, but bulbs with more than two stems are unusual. Planted narcissi bulbs produce daughter bulbs in the axil of the bulb scales, leading to the dying off of the exterior scales. To prevent planted bulbs forming more and more small bulbs, they can be dug up every 5–7 years, and the daughters separated and replanted separately, provided that a piece of the basal plate, where the rootlets are formed, is preserved. For daffodils to flower {{at the end of the}} winter or early spring, bulbs are planted in autumn (September–November). This plant does well in ordinary soil but flourishes best <b>in</b> <b>rich</b> soil. Daffodils like the sun but also accepts partial shade exposure.|$|E

30|$|When {{examining}} {{the relationships between}} materialism and well-being, it {{should be kept in}} mind that different economic and cultural circumstances can influence the meaning of materialism and values toward possessions and consumption within a society. As argued by Delhey (2010, p 81) “happiness tends to be pretty materialist in poorer places and more post-materialist <b>in</b> <b>richer</b> ones”. Comparing the data of 48 countries, the author showed that income and possessions are more important pillars for personal quality of life in poorer than <b>in</b> <b>richer</b> countries.|$|R

25|$|On a {{utilitarian}} basis, {{which has}} traditionally been used in welfare economics, an argument {{can be made for}} richer countries taking on most of the burdens of mitigation (Halsnæs et al., 2007). However, another result is possible with a different modeling of impacts. If an approach is taken where the interests of poorer people have lower weighting, the result {{is that there is a}} much weaker argument in favour of mitigation action <b>in</b> <b>rich</b> countries. Valuing climate change impacts in poorer countries less than domestic climate change impacts (both in terms of policy and the impacts of climate change) would be consistent with observed spending <b>in</b> <b>rich</b> countries on foreign aid (Hepburn, 2005; Helm, 2008:229).|$|E
