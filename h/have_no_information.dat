25|$|In 1284 George Terter I {{concluded}} a new treaty with Andronikos II Palaiologos, and retrieved his first wife, while Theodore Svetoslav at first remained a hostage. The same treaty required the breaking {{off of the}} alliance with Thessaly and Theodore Svetoslav's intended bride was also sent to Byzantium. It was only in 1285 that the Patriarch of Bulgaria Joakim III arrived in Constantinople and arranged {{for the release of}} Theodore Svetoslav, who was now supposed to marry a daughter of the high court official John Synadenos. We <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>information</b> whether this marriage materialized.|$|E

Thiệu kept a low profile, and in 1990 even the Foreign Office claimed to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>information</b> on his whereabouts. In the early 1990s, Thiệu took up residence in Foxborough, Massachusetts, where he lived reclusively. He never produced an autobiography, rarely assented to interviews and shunned visitors. Neighbors had little contact with him or knowledge of him, aside from seeing him walking his dog. He did, however, appear in the 1980 documentary television mini-series , discussing his time as president of South Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, {{garments}} more closely resembling contemporary bras had emerged, although large-scale commercial production {{did not occur}} until the 1930s. Since then bras have replaced corsets (although some women prefer camisoles) and a minority go without. The metal shortages of World War II encouraged {{the end of the}} corset. By the time the war ended, most fashion-conscious women in Europe and North America were wearing bras. From there the bra was adopted by women in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, although we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>information</b> about what arrangements, if any, immediately preceded the adoption of the bra across Asia, Africa and Latin America.|$|E

25|$|Ren {{retains a}} direct 1.42 {{percent share of}} the company. The {{remainder}} of the shares is held by “a trade union committee tied to the affiliate Shenzhen Huawei Investment Holding Co.” This body represents Huawei’s employee shareholders. About 64 percent of Huawei staff participate in this scheme (approximately 61,000 Chinese employees; the 50,000-plus foreign employees are not eligible), and hold what the company calls “virtual restricted shares.” These shares are nontradable and are allocated to reward performance. When employees leave Huawei, their shares revert to the company, which compensates them for their holding. Although employee shareholders receive dividends, it is reported that they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>information</b> on their holding.|$|E

25|$|While the Aitareya deals almost {{exclusively}} with the Soma sacrifice, the Kaushitaka, {{in its first}} six chapters, treats of the several kinds of haviryajna, or offerings of rice, milk, ghee, etc., whereupon follows the Soma sacrifice in this way, that chapters 7–10 contain the practical ceremonial and 11–30 the recitations (shastra) of the hotar. Sayana, {{in the introduction to}} his commentary on the work, ascribes the Aitareya to the sage Mahidasa Aitareya (i.e. son of Itara), also mentioned elsewhere as a philosopher; and it seems likely enough that this person arranged the Brahmana and founded the school of the Aitareyins. Regarding the authorship of the sister work we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>information,</b> except that the opinion of the sage Kaushitaki is frequently referred to in it as authoritative, and generally in opposition to the Paingya—the Brahmana, it would seem, of a rival school, the Paingins. Probably, therefore, it is just what one of the manuscripts calls it—the Brahmana of Sankhayana (composed) in accordance with the views of Kaushitaki.|$|E

25|$|CCDC130 {{is located}} on the short arm of {{chromosome}} 19 in humans. The exact locus is 19p13.2. The entire gene spans from 13858753-13874106 on the + strand of chromosome 19. CCDC130 is bordered upstream by CACNA1A on the - strand, glatobu, smagly, and socho on the + strand, and downstream by MGC3207, C19orf53, ZSWIM4 on the + strand and joypaw, smeygly, floytobu, smawgly, and wycho on the - strand. Glatobu, smagly, socho, joypaw, smeygly, floytobu, smawgly, and wycho have only been verified by cDNA sequences in GenBank and <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>information</b> available about their function. There are also several small genes found within the CCDC130 sequence, with snugly, glytobu, stygly, and glartobu occurring on the + strand and chacho, zoycho, spogly, glotobu, glutobu, and sneygly occurring on the - strand. All of these small genes have extremely low levels of expression (under 3% of the expression of the average gene), with stygly having the highest expression at 2.8% of the average.|$|E

2500|$|Korela {{accompanied}} Novgorodians for {{yet another}} attack against the Yem in 1191. This time the fighting is clearly said {{to have taken place}} [...] "the land of the Yem", the first such entry in Russian chronicles. The assailants [...] "burned the country and killed the cattle". Very hypothetically this may have been the same attack that was mentioned in a much later Swedish chronicle, the mid-16th century Chronicon episcoporum Finlandensium by Bishop Paulus Juusten, that records the Russians burning [...] "Turku" [...] in 1198, at the time of Bishop Folquinus.

Shortly after 1290, the chapel, which measured only about 5.5 by 3.2m, became entirely inadequate to accommodate the throngs of pilgrims. The altar piece, an Annunciation, was painted by the priest Hilarius of Viterbo in 1393. The monastery was at most the residence, only for a short time, of the ministers-general of the order after St. Francis. In 1415 it first became associated with the Regular Observance, {{in the care of}} which it remains to the present day.|$|E

2500|$|Dr. Griffin's {{conspicuous}} army {{service in}} Southern California combined with his sterling personal qualities no doubt {{contributed to his}} rapid rise to leadership in civic and business affairs in Los Angeles, and to his acquisition of a large surgical practice within a few years.

2500|$|Assuming Quaresma {{is indeed}} Fernando de Noronha, then who {{discovered}} it? [...] One proposal {{is that it}} was discovered by a royal Portuguese mapping expedition that was sent out in May, 1501, commanded by an unknown captain (possibly André Gonçalves) and also accompanied by Amerigo Vespucci. [...] According to Vespucci, this expedition returned to Lisbon in September 1502, just on time to influence the final composition of the Cantino map. [...] Unfortunately, Vespucci does not report discovering this island then – indeed he is quite clear that the first time he (and his fellow sailors) saw the island was on the 1503 Coelho expedition. However, there is a letter written by an Italian saying that a ship arrived [...] "from the land of Parrots" [...] in Lisbon on July 22, 1502 (three months before Vespucci). [...] This could be a stray ship from the mapping expedition that returned prematurely, or another expedition altogether, about which we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>information.</b> [...] The timing of its reputed arrival (July 1502), makes it possible that it stumbled on the island sometime in March 1502, on the homeward voyage, well within Lent.|$|E
2500|$|Cilappatikaram {{is one of}} the {{outstanding}} works of general literature of this period. [...] The authorship and exact date of the classic Cilappatikaram are not definitely known. Ilango Adigal, who is credited with this work was reputed to be the brother of the Sangam age Chera king Senguttuvan. However we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>information</b> of such a brother in the numerous poems sung on the Chera king. The Cilappatikaram is unique in its vivid portrayal of the ancient Tamil land. This is unknown in other works of this period. Cilappatikaram and its companion epic Manimekalai are Buddhist in philosophy. Manimekalai was written by Sattanar who was a contemporary of Ilango Adigal. Manimekalai contains a long exposition of fallacies of logic which is considered {{to be based on the}} 5th century Sanskrit work Nyayapravesa by Dinnag. Kongu Velir, a Jain author wrote Perunkathai based on the Sanskrit Brihat-katha. Valayapathi and Kundalakesi are the names of two other narrative poems of this period written by a Jain and a Buddhist author respectively. These works have been lost and only a few poems of Valayapathi have been found so far.|$|E
