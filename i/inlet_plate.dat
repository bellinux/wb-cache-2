40|$|This thesis {{relates to}} the study of {{thermally}} stratified hot water storages used in district heating systems and is an extension of the doctoral theses of Jan Dahl and Roger Hermansson. The thermal performance of a stratified water storage is reduced by different phenomena such as heat transfer to the surroundings and mixing between hot and cold water during the charging of the tank. The study of the flow field in the storage tank gives a better understanding of these phenomena. The work described here is composed of two parts. The first concerns the development of a Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) technique, described in Paper I, which can be used to measure the velocity field in a model water heat storage. Paper II presents a study of phenomena affecting the accuracy of the PTV technique. The inaccuracy of the velocity measurements due to the limited resolution of the video camera increases rapidly if the time-step between pictures is too small. The number of incorrect identifications is also an important factor for the determination of the time-step. A method of selecting the appropriate time-step has been proposed in Paper III. With the help of a procedure to remove incorrect identifications, a method for evaluation of the velocity field aimed at reducing errors caused by resolution inaccuracy and incorrect particle identifications has been developed. The second part of this thesis concerns studies of flow patterns in a model water heat storage. Using the PTV technique presented previously, the natural convection boundary layer has been observed and measured in Paper IV. Flow phenomena caused by heat losses to the surrounding are found to have an important effect {{on the nature of the}} gradient zone. The gravity current resulting from the inflow of hot water in the tank filled with cold water has been studied in Paper V. A numerical simulation has been performed. The mixing has been quantified through an efficiency based on exergy. Phenomena leading to a loss of efficiency during the formation of the thermocline have been identified. The conditions of vortex formation at the edge of the <b>inlet</b> <b>plate</b> during the formation of the thermocline are investigated in Paper VI. A range of critical Richardson numbers, based on a comparison of experimental results, numerical simulation and theorietical analysis has been proposed. Godkänd; 1998; 20061123 (haneit...|$|E

This collaboration takes advantage of USCG bi-weekly Arctic Domain Awareness (ADA) flights, conducted with Hercules C- 130 aircraft from March to November each year. NOAA has installed window-replacement <b>inlet</b> <b>plates</b> on two USCG C- 130 aircraft and deploys a pallet with NOAA instrumentation on each ADA flight. Flights typically last 8 h and cover a very large area, traveling from Kodiak, AK in the south up to Barrow, AK in the north, and making altitude profiles near the coast {{as well as in}} the interior. NOAA instrumentation on each flight includes: a flask sampling system, a continuous CO 2 /CH 4 /CO/H 2 O analyzer, a continuous ozone analyzer, and an ambient temperature and humidity sensor. GPS time and location from the aircraft's navigation system are also collected. Air samples collected in flight are analyzed at NOAA/ESRL for the major greenhouse gases and a variety of halocarbons and hydrocarbons that influence climate, stratospheric ozone, and air quality. Instruments on this aircraft are designed and deployed to be able to collect air samples and data autonomously, so that NOAA personnel visit the site only for installation at the beginning of each season. We present an assessment of the cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) CO 2 /CH 4 /CO/H 2 O analyzer performance operating on an aircraft over a three-year period. We describe the overall system for making accurate greenhouse gas measurements using a CRDS analyzer on an aircraft with minimal operator interaction. Short and long-term stability of the CRDS analyzer over a seven-month deployment period is better than 0. 15 ppm, 2 ppb, and 5 ppb for CO 2 , CH 4 , CO respectively, considering differences of on-board reference tank measurements from a laboratory calibration performed prior to deployment. This stability is not affected by variation in pressure or temperature during flight. Biases and standard deviations of comparisons with flask samples suggest that atmospheric variability, flask-to-flask variability, and possible flask sampling biases may be driving biases in the comparison between flasks and in-situ CRDS measurements...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we numerically {{investigate}} {{the response of}} a perforated-plate stabilized laminar methane-air premixed flame to imposed inlet velocity perturbations. A flame model using detailed chemical kinetics mechanism is applied and heat exchange between the burner plate and the gas mixture is incorporated. Linear transfer functions, for low mean inlet velocity oscillations, are analyzed for different equivalence ratio, mean <b>inlet</b> velocity, <b>plate</b> thermal conductivity and distance between adjacent holes. The oscillations of the heat exchange rate {{at the top of}} the burner surface plays a critical role in driving the growth of the perturbations over a wide range of conditions, including resonance. The flame response to the perturbations at its base takes the form of consumption speed oscillations in this region. Flame stand-off distance increases/decreases when the flame-wall interaction strengthens/weakens, impacting the overall dynamics of the heat release. The convective lag between the perturbations and the flame base response govern the phase of heat release rate oscillations. There is an additional convective lag between the perturbations at the flame base and the flame tip which has a weaker impact on the heat release rate oscillations. At higher frequencies, the flame-wall interaction is weaker and the heat release oscillations are driven by the flame area oscillations. The response of the flame to higher amplitude oscillations are used to gain further insight into the mechanisms. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Combustion Institute.

The experimental data reported here include mean drop size and drop size distribution, spray cone half-angle, and momentum rate (directly related to spray penetration). The maximum entropy formalism, MEF, method to predict drop size distribution is applied and compared to the experimental data. Geometric variables considered include the radius of the injector <b>inlet</b> orifice <b>plate</b> through which oxidizer flows (&) and the exposed length from the fuel inlet to the injector exit plane (L 2).

40|$|Uneven {{distribution}} in heat exchangers {{is a cause}} of reduction in both thermal and fluid-dynamic performances. Many papers have dealt with single-phase flow and both flow distribution data and analytical or numerical models are available for header design. With regard to two-phase flow, phase separation in manifolds with several outlets is so complicated that, to date, there is no general way to predict the distribution of two-phase mixtures at header-channel junctions.

Results indicate that the inlets did not interact with each other sufficiently to affect inlet operability. Flow spillage resulting from a high speed inlet unstart did not propagate far enough upstream to affect the low speed inlet.

The conical inlet design presented here is more realistic than the flat plate design presented in the previous report, and {{is similar to the}} design that will be chosen as part of the Australian Space Research Program SCRAMSPACE flight test scheduled for 2012. The optical system was changed for this study to make the pitch and catch optics less sensitive to vibration, and to fit into a smaller volume than for the previous test.

40|$|With growing global warning {{concerns}} on {{the current}} breed of HFC refrigerants, a search for more environmentally-friendly fluids has already begun. Potential alternatives to replace R 134 a should have significantly lower global warming potential (GWP), operate at similar system pressures, and maintain all other advantages of R 134 a (non-flammability, dielectric properties, etc.). This study investigates four possible alternatives that have been identified by AHRI in its Low-GWP Alternative Refrigerants Evaluation Program. These refrigerants were R 1234 yf, R 1234 ze, N- 13 a (HDR- 17), and N- 13 b (HDR- 15). Each of these refrigerants was experimentally examined and compared to R 134 a in a two-phase pumped loop cooling system using a specifically designed test stand. This test stand included a liquid pump, an evaporator with a heating component, and an air-cooled condenser. For each test, refrigerant volume flow rate was varied to achieve the desired exit quality at a specified heat load while maintaining a constant amount of subcool. The heat loads were varied from 500 W to 1000 W while the exit quality ranged from 30 % to 80 %. R 1234 yf required substantial volume flow rate increases to achieve similar cooling effects as R 134 a; however, R 1234 ze, N- 13 a, and N- 13 b appear {{to be much more}} viable solutions, due to smaller increases in volume flow rate required. A number of variables were examined to determine the thermal performance of each refrigerant, including cold plate surface temperatures, cold <b>plate</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet refrigerant temperatures, and heat transfer coefficients.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{is to develop a}} high efficiency two-dimensional reactive flow solver to investigate perforated-plate stabilized laminar premixed flames. The developed code is used to examine the impact of the operating conditions and the perforated plate design on the steady flame characteristics. It is also used to numerically investigate the response of these flames to imposed inlet velocity perturbations. The two-dimensional simulations are performed using a reduced chemical kinetics mechanism for methane-air combustion, consisting of 20 species and 79 reactions. Heat exchange is allowed between the gas mixture and the solid plate. The physical model is based on a zero-Mach-number formulation of the axi-symmetric compressible conservation equations. The steady results suggest that the flame consumption speed, the flame structure, and the flame surface area depend significantly on the equivalence ratio, mean inlet velocity, the distance between the perforated plate holes and the plate thermal conductivity. In the case of an adiabatic plate, a conical flame is formed, anchored near the corner of the hole. When the heat exchange between the mixture and the plate is finite, the flame acquires a Gaussian shape stabilizing at a stand-off distance, that grows with the plate conductivity. The flame tip is negatively curved; i. e. concave with respect to the reactants. Downstream of the plate, the flame base is positively curved; i. e. convex with respect to the reactants, stabilizing above a stagnation region established between neighboring holes. As the plate's thermal conductivity increases, the heat flux to the plate decreases, lowering its top surface temperature. As the equivalence ratio increases, the flame moves closer to the plate, raising its temperature, and lowering the flame stand-off distance. As the mean inlet velocity increases, the flame stabilizes further downstream, the flame tip becomes sharper, hence raising the burning rate at that location. The curvature of the flame base depends on the distance between the neighboring holes; and the flame there is characterized by high concentration of intermediates, like carbon monoxide. To investigate flame dynamics, linear transfer functions, for low mean inlet velocity oscillations, are analyzed for different equivalence ratio, mean <b>inlet</b> velocity, <b>plate</b> thermal conductivity and distance between adjacent holes. The oscillations of the heat exchange rate {{at the top of the}} burner surface plays a critical role in driving the growth of the perturbations over a wide range of conditions, including resonance. The flame response to the perturbations at its base takes the form of consumption speed oscillations in this region. Flame stand-off distance increases/decreases when the flame-wall interaction strengthens/weakens, impacting the overall dynamics of the heat release. The convective lag between the perturbations and the flame base response govern the phase of heat release rate oscillations. There is an additional convective lag between the perturbations at the flame base and the flame tip which has a weaker impact on the heat release rate oscillations. At higher frequencies, the flame-wall interaction is weaker and the heat release oscillations are driven by the flame area oscillations. The response of the flame to higher amplitude oscillations are used to gain further insight into the mechanisms.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 9 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Malta, 16 - 18 July, 2012. This paper is concerned with two-phase liquid-liquid flows through orifice plates in horizontal pipes, and in particular with a phenomenon known as “phase inversion” that can occur in dispersed flow. Experimental investigations were carried out in which two-phase flows comprising oil and water were pumped via an inlet section into a horizontal pipe of diameter 25. 4 mm and length 7 m. In one series of experiments the light phase (oil) was introduced into the inlet section above the heavier one (water), in a “stable” inlet configuration. This {{was followed by a}} set of experiments in which the water was introduced above the oil, in an “unstable” inlet configuration. Furthermore, tests were performed with and without the insertion of a static mixer just downstream of the <b>inlet.</b> The orifice <b>plate</b> was placed in two alternate positions with respect to the inlet: one near (1. 30 m) the inlet, and one far (5. 20 m) downstream, i. e., in both developing and fully developed flows. The pressure drop across the orifice plate was measured with a differential pressure transducer in a series of independent experimental runs in which the two liquid flow-rates were varied independently in order to span a range of superficial mixture velocities and inlet phase fractions (water-cuts). From the data generated in the present experimental campaign, the pressure drop measured across the orifice plate showed a gradual increase as the mixture velocities were increased, as expected. However, for a given mixture velocity, a decrease in the pressure drop across the orifice plate was observed as the water-cut was varied. This decrease was observed at water-cut values that were close to those for which phase inversion was expected in our flows (~ 0. 2 - 0. 3). It is inferred that the phase inversion point may be associated with this decrease in pressure drop. This interesting finding is contrary to the increase in pressure drop demonstrated in previous studies involving two-phase pipe flow and has important implications for the design of pipeline systems that incorporate orifice plates for flow measurement. In addition, the inlet orientation appeared to have little effect on the phase inversion point. dc 201...|$|R
