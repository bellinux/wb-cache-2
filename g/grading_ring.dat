Grading rings are similar to corona rings, but they {{encircle}} insulators rather than conductors.

50|$|The <b>grading</b> <b>ring</b> {{surrounds}} {{the end of}} the insulator next to the high voltage conductor. It reduces the gradient at the end, resulting in a more even voltage gradient along the insulator, allowing a shorter, cheaper insulator to be used for a given voltage. Grading rings also reduce aging and deterioration of the insulator that can occur at the high voltage end due to the high electric field there.|$|E
50|$|A corona ring, {{also called}} an anti-corona ring, is a toroid of {{conductive}} material, usually metal, which {{is attached to}} a terminal of high voltage equipment. The role of the corona ring is to distribute the electric field gradient and lower its maximum values below the corona threshold, preventing corona discharge. Corona rings are used on very high voltage power transmission insulators and switchgear, and on scientific research apparatus that generates high voltages. A very similar related device, the <b>grading</b> <b>ring</b> is used around insulators.|$|E

We determine when epsilon-strongly <b>graded</b> <b>rings</b> are separable over their principal components. Thereby, we simultaneously generalize a result for strongly group <b>graded</b> <b>rings</b> by Nastasescu, Van den Bergh and Van Oystaeyen, and a result for unital partial crossed products by Bagio, Lazzarin and Paques. We also show that the family of unital partial crossed products appear {{in the class of}} epsilon-strongly <b>graded</b> <b>rings</b> in a fashion similar to how the classical crossed products present themselves in the family of strongly <b>graded</b> <b>rings.</b> Thereby, we obtain, in the special case of unital partial crossed products, a short proof of a general result by Dokuchaev, Exel and Simón concerning when <b>graded</b> <b>rings</b> can be presented as partial crossed products.

40|$|The {{finite element}} model of the 1000 kV Ultra High Voltage (UHV) AC {{transmission}} line porcelain insulator string voltage distribution and <b>grading</b> <b>ring</b> surface electric field distribution calculation has the characteristics of large size, complicated structure and various mediums. To insure the accuracy, related influencing factors should be considered to simplify the model reasonably for improving computational efficiency. A whole model and a simplified 3 D {{finite element model}} of UHV AC transmission line porcelain insulator string were built. The influencing factors including tower, phase conductors, hardware fittings, yoke plate and phase interaction were considered in the analysis. And finally, the rationality of the simplified model was validated. The results comparison show that building a simplified model of three-phase bundled conductors within a certain length, simplifying the tower reasonably, omitting the hardware fittings and yoke plate and containing only single-phase insulator string model is feasible. The simplified model could replace the whole model to analyze the voltage distribution along the porcelain insulator string and the electric field distribution on the <b>grading</b> <b>ring</b> surface, and it can reduce the calculation scale, improve optimization efficiency of insulators string and <b>grading</b> <b>ring</b> parameters. </p...|$|E

These devices can {{be protected by}} ar-resters at the line entrance. An efficient and economical solution of a standard arrester integrated into a standard disconnector is covered here, which allows the arrester to be installed without addi-tional space requirements. The new device has been applied in 245 -kV- and 420 -kV-systems so far. Only for the 420 -kV-system some modifications to the <b>grading</b> <b>ring</b> of the arrester had to be intro-duced. This paper presents information on the requirements on the disconnector/arrester, the realiza-tion and the investigations and tests performed.

40|$|The current {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} {{to the study of the}} classical K_ 1 groups of <b>graded</b> <b>rings.</b> Let A be a Γ <b>graded</b> <b>ring</b> with identity 1, where the grading Γ is an abelian group. We associate a category with suspension to the Γ <b>graded</b> <b>ring</b> A. This allows us to construct the group valued functor K_ 1 of <b>graded</b> <b>rings.</b> It will be denoted by K_ 1 ^gr. It is not only an abelian group but also a Z[Γ]-module. From the construction, it follows that there exists "locally" a matrix description of K_ 1 ^gr of <b>graded</b> <b>rings.</b> The matrix description makes it possible to compute K_ 1 ^gr of various types of <b>graded</b> <b>rings.</b> The K_ 1 ^gr satisfies the well known K-theory exact sequence K_ 1 ^gr(A,I) → K_ 1 ^gr(A) → K_ 1 ^gr(A/I) for any graded ideal I of A.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{is in progress}} on the corona loss and radio interference characteristics of standard transmission line conductors energized with high voltage direct current. Corona loss has been measured on a single "Drake" ACSR conductor (1. 108 in. dia.) and on a two-conductor Drake bundle with 18 -inch spacing between conductors. These conductor arrangements were installed, in turn, on a 370 -foot outdoor line. A special shielding circuit permits conductor corona losses to be metered separately from both insulator leakage losses and the corona losses from connecting cable and <b>grading</b> <b>ring</b> assemblies. One type of test on this installation is conducted by recording corona loss currents while varying the voltage applied to the conductor in increments during periods of constand weather. A second type of test is conducted by recording loss currents while holding constant voltage on the test line for long periods under variable weather conditions. From results obtained to date, it appears that in dry weather single-conductor losses and two-conductor losses ar eequal, but negative losses are higher than positive losses {{by a factor of}} 2 to 3. In wet weather, losses from the two-conductor bundle, and negative losses from the single conductor, are all equal. (Corona loss data in wet weather for the single conductor at positive voltage is not yet available.) At present, test station facilities are being extended by the erection of a second line to enable simultaneous comparative measurements on conductors to be made; more comprehensive corona loss measurements are under way, and an investigation of radio interference is in progress.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} mainly {{concerned}} with the intersection between ideals and (maximal commutative) subrings of <b>graded</b> <b>rings.</b> The motivation for this investigation originates {{in the theory of}} C*-crossed product algebras associated to topological dynamical systems, where connections between intersection properties of ideals and maximal commutativity of certain subalgebras are well-known. In the last few years, algebraic analogues of these C*-algebra theorems have been proven by C. Svensson, S. Silvestrov and M. de Jeu for different kinds of skew group algebras arising from actions of the group Z. This raised the question whether or not this could be further generalized to other types of (strongly) <b>graded</b> <b>rings.</b> In this thesis we show that it can indeed be done for many other types of <b>graded</b> <b>rings</b> and actions! Given any (category) <b>graded</b> <b>ring,</b> there is a canonical subring which {{is referred to as the}} neutral component or the coefficient subring. Through this thesis we successively show that for algebraic crossed products, crystalline <b>graded</b> <b>rings,</b> general strongly <b>graded</b> <b>rings</b> and (under some conditions) groupoid crossed products, each nonzero ideal of the ring has a nonzero intersection with the commutant of the center of the neutral component subring. In particular, if the neutral component subring is maximal commutative in the ring this yields that each nonzero ideal of the ring has a nonzero intersection with the neutral component subring. Not only are ideal intersection properties interesting in their own right, they also play a key role when investigating simplicity of the ring itself. For strongly group <b>graded</b> <b>rings,</b> there is a canonical action such that the grading group acts as automorphisms of certain subrings of the <b>graded</b> <b>ring.</b> By using the previously mentioned ideal intersection properties we are able to relate G-simplicity of these subrings to simplicity of the ring itself. It turns out that maximal commutativity of the subrings plays a key role here! Necessary and sufficient conditions for simplicity of a general skew group ring are not known. In this thesis we resolve this problem for skew group rings with commutative coefficient rings...|$|R
