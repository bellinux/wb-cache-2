In September 1972, a boycott began at the school involving white {{community members}} and parents choosing not to send their <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> <b>school</b> due to overcrowding. By the 12th day of the boycott, the Board of Education requested for the parents to end the boycott and register the students; which would result in knowing the exact figure of overcrowding at the school. The school board had proposed a plan to send white students to another area high school and black students to Hyde Park High School, which parents declined. Black parents charged whites with racism over the situation, blaming the school's PTA president Irene Schrader. In addition to whites boycotting the school, Black students, parents and members from Operation PUSH also boycotted the school in October 1972; charging that the boundary proposal was racially motivated.|$|E

5000|$|The {{problem is}} bureaucracy. I'm {{one of these}} people who {{believes}} the best thing we could ever do is go to the full voucher system.I have a 17-year-old daughter who went to a private school for a few years before high school. This private school is the best school I've seen in my life. It was judged one of the 100 best schools in America. It was phenomenal. The tuition was $5,500 a year, which {{is a lot of money}} for most parents. But the teachers were paid less than public school teachers - so it's not about money at the teacher level. I asked the state treasurer that year what California pays on average to send <b>kids</b> <b>to</b> <b>school,</b> and I believe it was $4,400. While there are not many parents who could come up with $5,500 a year, there are many who could come up with $1,000 a year.If we gave vouchers to parents for $4,400 a year, schools would be starting right and left.
