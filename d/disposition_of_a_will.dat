50|$|Ademption by {{satisfaction}}, {{also known}} as satisfaction <b>of</b> legacies, is <b>a</b> common law doctrine that determines the <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> property under <b>a</b> <b>will</b> when the testator has made lifetime gifts to beneficiaries named in the will. Under the doctrine, a gift that the maker of the will (the testator) gives during his lifetime to <b>a</b> named beneficiary <b>of</b> the will is treated as <b>an</b> advance payment <b>of</b> that beneficiary's inheritance. If the probate court determines that the testator intended the lifetime gift to satisfy a bequest under the will, {{the amount of the}} lifetime gift is deducted from the amount that the beneficiary would have received under the will.|$|R

50|$|The Portuguese laws can loose their {{effectiveness}} either by expiry or by revocation. The expiry {{can result from}} a clause in the own law (saying {{that the law is}} only effective during a given time or while a given situation occurs) or can result from the disappearance of the cause that originated the creation of the law. Regarding revocation, this results from the demonstration <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new <b>will</b> from the legislator against the previous will. The revocation can be partial (with only some <b>dispositions</b> <b>of</b> the old law being revoked by the new one) or total (with the revocation of the whole old law). The revocation can also be classified either as express (when a new law expressly declares the revocation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old one) or as tacit (when it results from the incompatibility <b>of</b> the <b>dispositions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new law with the <b>dispositions</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old one).|$|R

The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate systematically: the types of information that deputies believed play the most significant role in the decision-making process in general, the types of information that deputies used when determining which disposition to apply toward a juvenile charged with a particular offense, the personal and occupational characteristics of the individual deputy that might have had a bearing on the dispositions he applied toward a juvenile, if there was agreement between the types of information deputies generally believed were important to <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> cases and the types of information deputies actually utilized when making a decision in particular cases, if there was agreement among officers with respect to the <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> juvenile in particular cases, and the relationship among types of information deputies believed were important in particular cases, the dispositions they applied toward juveniles in that case and the nature of the case presented...|$|R
50|$|A {{marketing}} year is <b>a</b> period <b>of</b> one year (or sometimes less), designated for reporting and (or) analysis of production, marketing and <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> commodity. (<b>Disposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> agricultural crop might include such uses as food, animal feed, industry, seed, and export, {{as well as}} changes in stocks.) Because of year-to-year fluctuations in production, much marketing and <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> some commodities may reflect production that occurred during a previous calendar year. For this reason, analysis is often facilitated if the {{marketing year}} for a crop commences at {{about the time of}} harvest. However, world markets or other factors may also influence choice of beginning date for the marketing year for some commodities in some countries. Especially in the case of certain perishable fresh fruits and vegetables, the marketing year may be less than a full year in length, because economic activity of interest for reporting and analysis may be concluded within just a few months.|$|R
