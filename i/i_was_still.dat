5|$|I have then {{considered}} {{myself as}} a particle broken off from the grand mass of mankind; — I was alone, till some involuntary sympathetic emotion, like the attraction of adhesion, made me feel that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> {{a part of a}} mighty whole, from which I could not sever myself—not, perhaps, for the reflection has been carried very far, by snapping the thread of an existence which loses its charms in proportion as the cruel experience of life stops or poisons the current of the heart.|$|E
5|$|The {{first year}} of his reign was {{peaceful}} because the Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed <b>I,</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> occupied with the internal consolidation of the Ottoman Empire. Michael supported Sigismund of Luxembourg, King of Hungary, who launched a campaign against the Ottoman Empire {{in the autumn of}} 1419. They captured the city of Turnu Severin that Michael's father had lost to the Ottomans, but it was put under Sigismund's control. In retaliation, the sultan broke into Wallachia, forcing Michael to cede Giurgiu and other fortresses on the Danube to the Ottomans and to pay the tribute he had failed to send during the previous three years. Michael was also forced to send his two sons, Michael and Radu, as hostages to the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} impact of World War <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> not over, so {{as in the previous}} years there were not sponsored teams, but the cycling companies had bundled their forces under the nick La Sportive. The cyclists were divided in two categories, this time named 1ère class (first class), the professionals, and 2ème classe (second class), the amateurs. This year, some of the second class cyclists would finish higher than some of the first class cyclists.|$|E
25|$|When my father, who {{had been}} {{appointed}} by his country as public notary in the customs at Bugia acting for the Pisan merchants going there, was in charge, he summoned me to him while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a child, and having an eye to usefulness and future convenience, desired me to stay there and receive instruction {{in the school of}} accounting. There, when I had been introduced to the art of the Indians' nine symbols through remarkable teaching, knowledge of the art very soon pleased me above all else and I came to understand it.|$|E
25|$|Into the '60s, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> {{not of a}} {{frame of}} mind {{that we were not}} only making music, we were making history. But I did {{recognize}} the impact because acts were going all over the world at that time. I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E

25|$|After {{painting}} {{a series of}} pictures, {{some of which are}} still in existence today, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> dissatisfied and yet better prepared for experiments that would go deeper. It was in 1910 that, for the first time, I showed in the Salon des Indépendants and completely abandoned the salon of the Nationale, where there was nothing more for me to do. I sent to the Cours-la-Reine a full figure, a full sized portrait of the poet René Arcos, as well as two landscapes of the area round Paris, simple collections of masses in restrained colours. From that moment onwards, I can see it clearly now, my researches passed from the surface to the interior of the plastic problem. So 1910 brought another white stone to my life, as it would mark a stage which, if it was not conclusive, would at least be very positive. Above all {{in the second half of}} that year, when I painted the canvasses which would appear in the Salon des Indépendants of 1911.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, Chabon {{reflected}} {{on the success of}} his first novel by saying that while [...] "the upside was that I was published and I got a readership, ... downside ... was that, emotionally, this stuff started happening and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> like, 'Wait a minute, is my thesis done yet?' It took me a few years to catch up." [...] In 1991, Chabon published A Model World, a collection of short stories, many of which had been published previously in The New Yorker.|$|E

500|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the Champions League tournament, Justin Langer retired from professional cricket. Trescothick replaced him as Somerset captain for the 2010 season. Somerset also lost Andrew Caddick, who at the age of 40 said that he opted to retire [...] "while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> physically and mentally strong". Wicket-keeper Carl Gazzard also announced his retirement {{at the end of the}} season aged 27, having lost his place in the Somerset side to Craig Kieswetter. Additionally, Somerset released Wes Durston and Omari Banks, both of whom they felt were surplus to requirements. Somerset addressed the weakness of their spin bowling by signing Murali Kartik as their overseas player for 2010.|$|E

And do you know why? Because Christians are retarded! They believe in a talking dead guy!" [...] "The Ring" [...] ends with a tongue-in-cheek cautionary message against engaging in oral sex, depicting Kenny's death from a sexually transmitted disease in the final moments of the episode. When asked whether Stone really believed purity rings were [...] "lame", as they were portrayed in [...] "The Ring", he said, [...] "Well, I don't know. I didn't have one in high school, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> lame." ...|$|E

His powers were thus {{initially}} assumed by a three-member Regency Council, which was chaired by Prince Muhammad Ali (son of the late Khedive Tawfiq Pasha and thus first cousin of King Farouk I) and also included Aziz Ezzat Pasha (a former Foreign Minister married to Behiye Yakan Hanem, another cousin of Farouk I) and Sherif Sabri Pasha (Farouk I's maternal uncle). The Council was formally sworn in on 8 May 1936 {{in front of a}} joint session of Parliament.

500|$|A Different Kind of Truth was {{described}} by Roth as [...] "a sort of collaboration with [...] past." [...] Seven of the album's tracks are based on material which Roth suggested dated back to between 1975 and 1977, whilst Eddie indicated that others had been composed [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> {{in high school and}} even junior high." [...] "Blood and Fire" [...] dates back to 1984. An instrumental version of the song, titled [...] "Ripley", appeared in Eddie's score for the film The Wild Life. The original title had been inspired by the Ripley guitar used by Eddie on the demo, and he sent that guitar back to Steve Ripley for repair so that it could be used on the album version.|$|E
500|$|Jones became {{interested}} in programming in high school, and learned Applesoft BASIC and 6502 Assembly on an Apple II series computer. When Apple released its Macintosh line, Jones's family purchased a Macintosh 128K, but Jones never programmed much for it. After high school Jones got a job programming for a computer-aided design company on PCs, before going to college the next year. In his off time Jones said that all he ever did on the Apple II was write games, [...] "and it seemed logical to continue that on the Mac," [...] he said. [...] "The first thing I did on the Mac was to port a modem game I'd written called Minotaur from 6502 Assembly on the Apple II into MPW C on the Mac. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> finishing that when I came to college. By that time, I knew I wanted to write games." ...|$|E
