5|$|In 1946 until mid-1947, the Piccards were {{consultants}} to General Mills (the cereal company and dominant industry in Minneapolis) working under Otto Winzen, who Jean had met through the university. Winzen and Jean proposed a stratosphere flight with 100 cluster balloons and secured a government {{contract with the}} Navy. Featured in Navy press releases, Jean was named a project scientist responsible for gondola design and for testing the balloon film materials. But he balked, both at making weekly status reports that made <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a lower-level employee, and {{at the prospect of}} General Mills owning the patents to his ideas. Working as a consultant, Jeannette threatened to break off ties with the Navy and General Mills unless she was allowed to fly with Jean. Unfortunately this began a rift between General Mills and the Piccards. They were both were fired in 1947, for they were too critical of Winzen and General Mills staff.|$|E

500|$|In a {{cover story}} for Entertainment Weekly, Mars stated that the song [...] "Nothin' on You" [...] was {{rejected}} by a [...] "music industry decision-maker" [...] (a person he won't name) because of his race.

[...] "Even with that song in my back pocket to seal the deal, things like that are coming out of people's mouths. It made me feel like I wasn't even in the room." [...] In April 2013, in {{a cover story}} for GQ magazine, Mars confessed that he changed his surname because people in the music industry took him as another Latino artist, and even tried to convince him to sing in Spanish saying: [...] "Your last name's Hernandez, maybe you should do the Latin music, this Spanish music... Enrique [...] is so hot right now”. Nevertheless, Mars used his childhood nickname Bruno and changed his surname to Mars, in an effort to [...] "avoid being stereotyped".|$|E
500|$|Originally, Che was {{intended}} to be a much more traditional film based on Jon Lee Anderson's 1997 biography Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life. Actor Benicio del Toro and producer Laura Bickford optioned the film rights to Anderson's book. However, after two years they had not found a suitable writer and the rights expired. During this time, Del Toro and Bickford researched the events depicted in Guerrilla with the idea of exploring Guevara's attempts to start a revolution in Bolivia. Del Toro has said that he previously only thought of Guevara as a [...] "bad guy". For his role, Del Toro spent seven years [...] "obsessively researching" [...] Guevara's life, which made <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> he [...] "earned his stripes" [...] to interpret the character. Preparation included looking at Guevara's photographs and reading his personal writings. Del Toro read Don Quixote, one of Guevara's favorites, and the first book published and given out free after the Cuban Revolution. Del Toro then personally met with people from different stages of Guevara's life, including Guevara's younger brother and childhood friends, traveling to Cuba where Del Toro met Guevara's widow, family, and [...] "tons of people that loved this man". The visit included a five-minute encounter at a book fair with Fidel Castro, who expressed that he was happy for the [...] "serious" [...] research being undertaken. Such research included collaborating with the three surviving guerrillas from Guevara's ill-fated Bolivian campaign, and with several guerrillas who fought alongside him in Cuba. While researching for both films, Soderbergh made a documentary of his interviews with {{many of the people who}} had fought alongside Guevara. In his encounters with people ranging from fellow guerrillas to Guevara's driver, Del Toro described the reaction as [...] "always the same", stating that he was [...] "blown away" [...] by the [...] "bucketful of love" [...] they still harbored for Guevara. In an interview, Del Toro described Guevara as [...] "a weird combination of an intellectual and an action figure, Gregory Peck and Steve McQueen, wrapped in one". After the film's production concluded, Del Toro professed that [...] "when you tell the story of Che, you're telling a story of the history of a country, so you have to be very careful".|$|E

2500|$|In his {{autobiography}} I Had a Hammer, which was co-written with Lonnie Wheeler {{and published in}} 1992, outfielder Hank Aaron wrote that he accepted an amphetamine pill from an unnamed teammate and taken it before a game during the 1968 season, after becoming frustrated about his lack of offensive performance. Aaron described it as [...] "a stupid thing to do", observing that the pill made <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> he [...] "was having a heart attack".|$|E
2500|$|Kuhlmann's [...] early poetry {{included}} {{a book of}} epicedia, or funeral poems (1668), an epithalamium (wedding poem, 1668), and a eulogy that praised a literary society called Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft ("Fruit-bringing society", 1670). [...] As Gerhart Hoffmeister writes, [...] "the acclaim he received made <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a 'second Opitz' – perhaps an early sign that he was becoming overly self-confident or even delusional before a grave illness (typhoid fever?) struck him in 1669.|$|E
2500|$|Rimmer's {{status as}} a {{hologram}} in most episodes of Red Dwarf is shown by the [...] "H" [...] on the centre of his forehead, leading to nicknames from the Cat, such as [...] "alphabet head" [...] and [...] "goalpost head". Rimmer keeps his unmanageable hair relatively short, deciding that it makes <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> more of a man. When Lister and the Cat respond to a drill too slowly, Rimmer argues for increased discipline and sensible haircuts, believing that [...] "every major battle in history has been won by the side with the shortest haircuts" [...] (resulting in the Cat insulting his hair-do by saying that he has hair like his, just not on his head).|$|E

2500|$|Ben confides to Sally {{that his}} life is empty. She yearns for him to hold her, but young Sally slips {{between them and the}} three move {{together}} ("Too Many Mornings"). Ben, caught in the passion of memories, kisses Sally as Buddy watches from the shadows. Sally thinks this is a sign that the two will finally get married, and Ben is about to protest until Sally interrupts him with a kiss and runs off to gather her things, thinking that the two will leave together. Buddy leaves the shadows furious, and fantasizes about the girl he should have married, Margie, who loves him and makes <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> [...] "a somebody", but bitterly concludes he does not love her back ("The Right Girl"). He tells Sally that he's done, but she is lost in a fantasy world, and tells him that Ben has asked her to marry him. Buddy tells her she must be either crazy or drunk, but he's already supported Sally through rehab clinics and mental hospitals and cannot take any more. Ben drunkenly propositions Carlotta, with whom he once had a fling, but she has a young lover and coolly turns him down. Heidi Schiller, joined by her younger counterpart, performs [...] "One More Kiss", her aged voice a stark contrast to the sparkling coloratura of her younger self. Phyllis kisses a waiter and confesses to him that she had always wanted a son. She then tells Ben that their marriage can't continue the way it has been. Ben replies by saying that he wants a divorce, and Phyllis assumes the request is due to his love for Sally. Ben denies this, but still wants Phyllis out. Angry and hurt, Phyllis considers whether to grant his request ("Could I Leave You?").|$|E
2500|$|Juri's {{personality}} {{was proposed}} by Ono to {{be a strong}} character, and while laughing compared it to that of a protester. She was originally designed to be a nice person who happens to be consorting with bad characters, but Ono went against this, stating [...] "she can't be a good girl. Surprise everyone and make her a really evil chick." [...] Her quotes were designed {{to have a lot of}} double entendres, with writer Kawasaki, citing one quote that while it appears as a compliment of their physique, her opponent may take offense to it. Initially, she was designed to be always smiling, similar to other female characters according to developer Kamei. However, it did not fit, resulting in the team working on other faces, some he describes as [...] "scary." [...] The team eventually settled on a [...] "cool-headed" [...] look. Kamei commented that one of his favourite expressions of Juri's is the one she makes when she appears to be having fun; he adds that this look made <b>him</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> the animators had finally began to understand the character. In designing her eyes, Kamei wanted her eyes to have more expression to them than other characters, commenting that the team [...] "wanted her to tell a story with her eyes." [...] Because of the anger from Korean fans over the lack of a Korean character in Street Fighter, the team decided to make her a strong character. Juri is said to have a warlike and provocative character and enjoys playing around with her opponent while beating them. She has also been described in a similar fashion, including [...] "sex-crazed" [...] and [...] "sultry." [...] Developer Tamamura describes her as a [...] "pleasure-seeker" [...] and a [...] "character who would enjoy fighting." ...|$|E

During an {{interview}} with songwriter and record producer Emanuel Kiriakou she said: [...] "Nightingale is definitely a personal song.

2500|$|For Mortal Kombat X, he was {{designed}} by NetherRealm Studios character artist Solomon Gaitan, who initially referenced actor Yul Brynner when digitally sculpting Quan Chi's facial features.
