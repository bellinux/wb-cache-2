40|$|Efficient sensing of {{trace amount}} nitroaromatic (NAC) {{explosives}} {{has become a}} major research focus in recent time due to concerns over national security as well as their role as environment pollutants. NO 2 -containing electron-deficient aromatic compounds, such as picric acid (PA), trinitrotoluene (TNT), and dinitrotoluene (DNT), are the common constituents of many commercially available chemical <b>explosives.</b> In this <b>article,</b> we have summarized our recent developments on the rational design of electron-rich self-assembled discrete molecular sensors and their efficacy in sensing nitroaromatics both in solution as well as in vapor phase. Several p-electron-rich fluorescent metallacycles (squares, rectangles, and tweezers/pincers) and metallacages (trigonal and tetragonal prisms) have been synthesized by means of metal-ligand coordination-bonding interactions, with enough internal space to accommodate electron-deficient nitroaromatics at the molecular level by multiple supramolecular interactions. Such interactions subsequently result in the detectable fluorescence quenching of sensors even in the presence of trace quantities of nitroaromatics. The fascinating sensing characteristics of molecular architectures discussed in this article may enable future development of improved sensors for nitroaromatic explosives...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} independent effects of two change interventions on employee attitudes. The first study evaluates {{the impact of}} a total qualitymanagement (TQM) inter-vention, while the second explores the effect of profit sharing on a core outcome of TQM: continuous improvement orientation at the individual level. The research design involved an employee survey with two measurement occasions: 9 and 32 months after the com-mencement of a TQM intervention (n = 118) and 10 months before and 20 months after the introduction of a profit sharing program (n = 141). The findings of Study 1 indicate that participation in a TQM intervention can enhance the development of employees’ori-entation to continuous improvement, explaining 5 % additional variance in the dependent variable. The results of Study 2 suggest that perceived fairness of profit sharing and per-ceived ability to contribute to the profitability of a site are significantly associated with continuous improvement orientation, explaining 6 % additional variance. The implica-tions of these findings for organizational change are discussed.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A model has been developed to assess the hazard presented by a condensed phase explosion in a built-up area. The principal application of this model is {{as an aid to}} quantitative risk assessment (QRA) of operations involving the transport of high <b>explosive</b> substances' and <b>articles</b> by road or by rail. The methodology employed is to utilise a consequence model in conjunction with a scenario model. The consequence model is used to establish as a function of distance the intensities of the various explosion phenomena and then to estimate, again as a function of distance, the injuries that are likely to result. This yields probabilities that persons will become casualties of the accident, given that people are exposed to the hazard. This effectively determines the level of individual risk as a function of distance. The scenario model is employed to define the location of the population in terms of its vulnerability (exposure) {{at the time of the}} explosion. This enables the total number of casualties to be estimated and is effectively a measure of societal risk. Elements of the consequence model include submodels for housing damage and. indoor injury; window breakage and injury from flying glass; air blast and injury by lung damage, eardrum rupture and impact as a result of bodily displacement; fireball and bum injury; generation, flight and wounding power of primary fragments; other explosion ejecta; and falling building debris (glass and masonry). The overall model has been implemented as a computer program, 'EXMOD'. The primary fragmentation submodel has been used as the basis of another, 'EXFRAG'. Many of the results presented in this thesis have been obtained with the aid of these computer programs...|$|R
