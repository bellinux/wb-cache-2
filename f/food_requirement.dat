50|$|The {{grey seal}} feeds {{on a wide}} variety of fish, mostly benthic or {{demersal}} species, taken at depths down to 70 m (230 ft) or more. Sand eels (Ammodytes spp) are important in its diet in many localities. Cod and other gadids, flatfish, herring, wrasse and skates are also important locally. However, it is clear that the grey seal will eat whatever is available, including octopus and lobsters. The average daily <b>food</b> <b>requirement</b> is estimated to be 5 kg (11 lb), though the seal does not feed every day and it fasts during the breeding season.|$|E

50|$|The white-tailed eagle's diet is varied, {{opportunistic}} and seasonal. Prey specimens {{can often}} include fish, birds and mammals. Many birds live largely as scavengers, regularly pirating food from otters and other birds including cormorants, gulls, ospreys {{and various other}} raptors. Carrion is often the primary food source during lean winter months, with fish and ungulates preferred but everything from cetaceans to livestock to even humans being eaten after death. Among the scavengers in their range, eagles are often dominant over all but perhaps the largest carnivorous mammals (i.e. gray wolves, etc.) However, this eagle {{can be a powerful}} hunter as well. In Scotland, the diet of this species differs significantly from that of sympatric golden eagles, as is also the case in Norway. The daily <b>food</b> <b>requirement</b> for a white-tailed eagle is in range of 500 - 600 g. Although generally a less active hunter than the golden eagle, competition over food can go either way depending on the individual eagle. They can exist at higher population densities and typically outnumber golden eagles because of their longer gut and more efficient digestive system, being able to live better with less food.|$|E
