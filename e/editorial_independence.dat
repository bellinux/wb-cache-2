5|$|When Philadelphia Media Holdings L.L.C. (PMH) {{bought the}} paper in 2006, Brian P. Tierney and the {{business}} people behind PMH signed a pledge promising {{that they would not}} influence the content of the paper. Tierney, a Republican activist who had represented many local groups in the Philadelphia area, had criticized The Inquirer in the past on behalf of his clients. One of Tierney's clients had been the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia, which he had represented during the Cipriano affair. PMH membership also included Bruce E. Toll, vice chairman of Toll Brothers Inc. Tierney said that the group was aware that the fastest way to ruin its investment in The Inquirer was to threaten the paper's <b>editorial</b> <b>independence.</b> The 2012 sale of Philadelphia Media Network to six local business leaders also led to concern of conflict of interest. The new owners, which included New Jersey Democratic fundraiser George Norcross III, media entrepreneur H. F. Lenfest, former New Jersey Nets owner Lewis Katz, and CEO of Liberty Property Trust and chairman of the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce William Hankowsky, pledged not to influence the content of the paper.|$|E

25|$|There was {{excitement}} that The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News {{would be under}} local ownership {{for the first time}} since Walter Annenberg sold the paper to Knight Newspapers in 1969. The buyout was met with skepticism, however, among the employees at The Inquirer, who feared the new owners might threaten the <b>editorial</b> <b>independence</b> of the newspaper. Concerns were especially directed to Brian Tierney, who in the past had criticized Inquirer reporters for doing negative stories about his clients during his time at Tierney Communications. Tierney allayed fears by having the members of Philadelphia Media Holdings sign a pledge not to interfere with the paper's <b>editorial</b> <b>independence.</b> Tierney said he would combat The Inquirers decreasing revenue and circulation by spending millions on advertisements and promotions and not by laying off staff.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} cases where RTHK's <b>editorial</b> <b>independence</b> has been fully exemplified.

25|$|In September 2012 The Guardian {{reported}} that Al Jazeera's <b>editorial</b> <b>independence</b> came into question when the channel's director of news, Salah Negm, stepped {{in at the}} last minute to order that a two-minute video covering a UN debate over the Syrian civil war include a speech by the leader of Qatar, Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.

25|$|While Die Fackel {{at first}} resembled {{journals}} like Die Weltbühne, it increasingly became {{a magazine that}} was privileged in its <b>editorial</b> <b>independence,</b> thanks to Kraus's financial independence. Die Fackel printed what Kraus wanted to be printed. In its first decade, contributors included such well-known writers and artists as Peter Altenberg, Richard Dehmel, Egon Friedell, Oskar Kokoschka, Else Lasker-Schüler, Adolf Loos, Heinrich Mann, Arnold Schönberg, August Strindberg, Georg Trakl, Frank Wedekind, Franz Werfel, Houston Stewart Chamberlain and Oscar Wilde. After 1911, however, Kraus was usually the sole author. Kraus's work was published nearly exclusively in Die Fackel, of which 922 irregularly issued numbers appeared in total. Authors who were supported by Kraus include Peter Altenberg, Else Lasker-Schüler, and Georg Trakl.|$|E
25|$|In late September 2001, VOA aired {{a report}} that {{contained}} brief excerpts of an interview with then Taliban leader Mullah Omar Mohammad, along with segments from President Bush's post-9/11 speech to Congress, an expert in Islam from Georgetown University, and comments by {{the foreign minister of}} Afghanistan's anti-Taliban Northern Alliance. State Department officials including Richard Armitage and others argued that the report amounted to giving terrorists a platform to express their views. In response, reporters and editors argued for the VOA's <b>editorial</b> <b>independence</b> from its governors. VOA received praise from press organizations for its protests, and the following year in 2002, it won the University of Oregon's Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism.|$|E

25|$|The Guardian {{is part of}} the Guardian Media Group (GMG) of newspapers, radio {{stations}} and print media including; The Observer Sunday newspaper, The Guardian Weekly international newspaper, and new media—Guardian Abroad website, and guardian.co.uk. All the aforementioned were owned by The Scott Trust, a charitable foundation existing between 1936 and 2008, which aimed to ensure the paper's <b>editorial</b> <b>independence</b> in perpetuity, maintaining its financial health to ensure it did not become vulnerable to take overs by for-profit media groups. At the beginning of October 2008, the Scott Trust's assets were transferred to a new limited company, The Scott Trust Limited, with the intention being that the original trust would be wound up. Dame Liz Forgan, chair of the Scott Trust, reassured staff that the purposes of the new company remained the same as under the previous arrangements.|$|E
25|$|The College Tribune {{was founded}} in 1989, with the {{assistance}} of noted political commentator Vincent Browne. Then an evening student at the university, Browne noted the lack of an independent media outlet for students and staff and set about rectifying this with the establishment of a student newspaper. The paper was initially established with links to The Sunday Tribune, though over time these links faded and ultimately, the Tribune would long outlast its national counterpart. The paper has since its inception supported itself financially through commercial advertising in its print edition. Operating under such a model allows the paper and its staff to maintain genuine <b>editorial</b> <b>independence</b> from both university authorities and the Students' Union. The Tribune has been recognised {{on a number of occasions}} at the national student media awards, particularly in sports writing, of which the paper maintains a strong tradition. In addition to winning Student Newspaper of the Year at the 1996 USI & Irish Independent Media Awards, then editor Conor Lally was also awarded Student Journalist of the Year. 2003 saw Tribune stalwart Peter Lahiff win Diversity Writer of the Year at the Guardian Student Media Awards, to-date the only Irish based recipient of a Guardian award.|$|E

500|$|Early {{editorial}} cartooning {{lacked a}} local flavour, tending to be a pale imitation of American examples. It {{tended to be}} cheery, non-confrontational, and supported good causes. Following the War it broke from typical American clichés and took on more of a savage bite, especially compared to the more allegorical tendencies of American editorial cartoons. At Le Devoir, Robert Lapalme {{was the first to}} cartoon in this particularly Canadian idiom, and in 1963 organized an International Salon of Caricature and Cartoon in Montreal. Lapalme was later followed by Duncan Macpherson at the Toronto Star, Leonard Norris at the Vancouver Sun and Ed McNally at the Montreal Star. These cartoonists frequently took political positions contrary to those of the papers in which they were published. Macpherson drew a cartoon of John Diefenbaker as Marie Antoinette saying [...] "Let them eat cake" [...] in response to the Prime Minister's cancelling the Avro Arrow project, which historian Pierre Burton has called the beginning of Canadians' disillusionment with Diefenbaker's government. Macpherson in particular fought fiercely for <b>editorial</b> <b>independence,</b> challenging his editors and threatening to quit the Star if not given his way, which paved a new path for other cartoonists to follow.|$|E
500|$|In 2005 Tierney {{attempted}} to buy magazines Inc. and Fast Company from Gruner + Jahr, but failed. [...] Tierney tried again {{to enter the}} media industry in March 2006 when he assembled a group of mostly former clients or people that are {{with him on the}} board of the Episcopal Academy to buy Philadelphia Newspapers Inc. He and other local businessman formed Philadelphia Media Holdings LLC and bought The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia Daily News and philly.com for US$515 million from The McClatchy Company which was selling off newspapers in unionized and low-growth markets after buying Philadelphia Newspapers Inc.'s parent company Knight Ridder. The buyout was met with skepticism by many at The Inquirer, especially by reporters who had been contacted in the past by Tierney on behalf of his clients. Tierney allayed fears with the members of Philadelphia Media Holdings signing a pledge not to interfere with the paper's <b>editorial</b> <b>independence.</b> Tierney said he would combat The Inquirers decreasing revenue by spending millions on advertisements and promotions and not by laying off staff.

40|$|The {{accountability}} of the ABC and SBS {{should be}} a two-way street. ACCOUNTABILITY {{is the price of}} statutory independence, and the price is considerable, especially for the kind of <b>editorial</b> and creative <b>independence</b> exercised by the ABC and SBS. As the Australian National Audit Office once observed dryly of the ABC, a national public broadcaster is subject to “more diverse” expectations of accountability than a private sector operator driven principally by the need to achieve a commercial profit. Having offered this self-evident truth about the national broadcasters, the Audit Office was silent on the reciprocal accountability of government. To survive, the public broadcaster must win and retain the endorsement of the community at large, including those who don’t frequently use its services yet support them through taxation. The public broadcaster must compete for a critical mass of listeners and viewers while also serving specialist audiences; it must retain credibility within a ratings-driven industry while adhering to public sector principles and values; it must serve parliament, not the government; and it must demonstrate leadership through innovation. Inevitably, public broadcasting operates in a politically contested zone where – as demonstrated again in recent months – the discourse is often combative and careless… Read the full articl...|$|R
5000|$|Like {{its parent}} the United Daily News, the World Journal is {{widely seen as}} taking an {{editorial}} line that favors the Pan-Blue coalition and the Kuomintang. It also opposes the Taiwanese independence ideology of the Pan-Green coalition. Consequently, this editorial position has made it much less hostile toward the People's Republic since the 1990s. Immediately after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the newspaper no longer referred indiscriminately to all mainland Chinese as [...] "Communist Chinese," [...] and additionally praised pro-democracy efforts on the mainland. During the mid-1990s, it began to give credit to the positive progress made in mainland China, and by the late-1990s, it began to criticize wrongdoings within the Chinese democracy movement and in the West {{in the same manner}} with which it criticizes corruption within the Chinese communist regime. After 2000, there has also been a marked increase in the representation of mainland Chinese immigrants on the newspaper's reporting staff. The anti-Taiwan <b>independence</b> <b>editorial</b> positions that the paper has taken have also made it popular among mainland Chinese immigrants to the United States.The newspaper has diversified in content and covers world business and politics, including proceedings at the United Nations Headquarters, as well as entertainment and human interest stories.|$|R

2500|$|The {{ultimate}} {{concern is}} whether RTHK has enough <b>editorial</b> <b>independence</b> {{for a public}} broadcaster.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} examines {{power and}} knowledge in strategic changes. It {{is a study}} of changes in three Swedish newspaper companies which developed from single-business to multi-business corporations. It is suggested that this transformation was based upon the establishment and reproduction of a new knowledge formation. This knowledge was the knowledge of strategy, particularly the classical perspective as it had emerged during {{the end of the}} 60 s {{and the beginning of the}} 70 s. A central theme in that knowledge was diversification which became more common in newspaper companies during the 70 s. In the study it is suggested that the changes can be interpreted as forms of isomorfism based on both professional and imitative aspects. However, the diversification efforts also disclosed historical editorial norms that were provoked and challenged. Newspaper companies had historically avoided diversification in order to sustain the <b>editorial</b> integrity of <b>independence.</b> When diversification efforts were pursued in the 70 s and 80 s, a resistance was thus mobilized. The study describes the opposition between those favouring diversification and those resisting it. It was in those struggles that the disciplinary forms of power emerged. In that emergence some people became locked into specific norms and knowledges, subsequently governing their behavior. The development created conflicts which obstructed and to some extent inhibited communication between central actors in the companies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{critically}} analyses whether ICASA effectively {{regulates the}} SABC {{so that it}} plays {{its role as a}} public service broadcaster in the public interest and promotes democracy. The study applies a combination of critical political economy of the media, theories of regulation and public service broadcasting as an analytical framework, and employs document analysis and qualitative interviews as methods. The study finds that in relation to monitoring the SABC’s license conditions, ICASA is to a large degree effective in the regulatory practices it employs. However ICASA tends to take a problematic stance by limiting its regulatory mandate to only monitor the license conditions. The study argues that ICASA’s mandate is and should be broader. Further, the study identifies an antagonistic relationship between ICASA and the SABC, which undermines the regulator’s ability to effectively regulate the SABC. The study also finds that ICASA’s regulation in general is characterized by a lack of proactive regulation in several areas. In this regard, the study demonstrates that ICASA has a regulatory practice that can be characterized as silent. The areas in which ICASA is silent when it should act include the SABC’s problematic commercial funding model which undermines its public service role. Editorial biases towards those in authority and controversial practices like withdrawing programmes and “blacklisting” commentators who are considered too critical of those in power, in ways that undermines its <b>editorial</b> and programming <b>independence.</b> The suspensions of the SABC’s two Executive members and calls for the SABC board to step down, which undermine the institutional independence that a public service broadcaster should possess. The study identifies a number of ICASA’s institutional weaknesses, which include its lack of independence in reality, its “politicised” appointment process, a lack of skilled personnel and “poaching”, “politicised” and inefficient accountability mechanisms, a lack of clarity of mandate and power regarding the SABC, as well as a lack of adequate and independent funding which result in ineffective regulatory practices. Finally the study makes recommendations for the strengthening of ICASA so that it becomes in an effective regulator functioning in the public interest...|$|R
