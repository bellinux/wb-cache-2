2500|$|Thy-1 {{is one of}} {{the most}} heavily glycosylated {{membrane}} proteins with a carbohydrate content up to 30% of its molecular mass. Thy1 in most species has 3 N-glycosylation sites (Asn 23, 74 and 98) but no O-glycosylation. The composition of Thy-1 carbohydrate moieties varies considerably between different tissues or even among cells of the same lineage at different stages of differentiation: e.g., galactosamine only in brain Thy-1, sialic acid in thymic Thy-1 in far excess than brain Thy-1, that too increasing in parallel with T cell maturation. In this regard it has yet another historic association: Thy1 happens to be the first glycoprotein in which cell type specificity of variant glycosylation on an invariant protein was demonstrated.

40|$|The {{technical}} efficiency indexes for the rural producer {{from the central}} region of Santa Catarina’s western side have been identified, thus enabling to determine their managerial profile through the evaluation of processes of decision-making in the properties, administration of agricultural business firms, strategical behaviour, time management, and information transferences. Moreover, the inter-relation among efficient enterprises and managerial ability, and vice-versa, was also verified. The methodology used in the qualitative analysis was the Data Envelopment Analysis-DEA, and the data used for such analysis were gathered {{by means of a}} semi-structured questionnaire. Twelve out of the fifty-eight analyzed properties did reach the efficiency frontier, thus being presented as benchmark to the other 46. After grouping the 58 units, through multivaried analysis, five distinct groups were defined for the studied sample, five inefficient properties having been chosen, one from each group, in order to enable {{for the development of the}} qualitative research. Plus, 4 of the properties which had been presented as benchmark were defined, enabling for the analysis on the firms which were considered as efficient. The study allowed one to state that a positive correlation between managerial abilities and {{technical efficiency}} does exist. However, one could also observe that the properties which showed to be technically efficient did not present specific features related to the managerial ability. The observed <b>differencials</b> were those resulting from a longer managerial experience as well as from the feeling which leads to correct decision-making. One single factor, considered preponderant for such matter, was the inexistence of integration in one single activity in all the efficient properties, a fact which was not observed in the inefficient ones. Another fact observed was a considerable lack of administrative maturity, generated mainly by insufficient instruction, and the lack of a sistemic visualization of the business. technical efficiency, managerial ability, DEA.,...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we avaluate the {{contribution}} of two different forms of discrimination (by gender and color) and three different types of segmentation (spacial, sectorial and between the formal and informal segments) in the labor market, regarding {{the reduction of the}} inequality degree in the labor remuneration and in per capita income. With the exeption of the segmentation between the formal and informal segments, all the other forms of discrimination and segmentation declined during the the decade and, in particular, during the last quarth. This reduction in the labor market?s imperfections, with it?s growing integration, had a fundamental part to explain the inequality drop of labor remuneration and per capita income. The drops in the geographic segmentation level (in particular, the segmentation between capitals and small cities) and sectorial were the most contributive factors for this recent inequality reduction. In fact, the reduction in the geographic segmentation degree contributed to explain 11 % to 22 % of the recent drop in the per capita income and labor remuneration?s inequality degree, respectively. The reduction in the segmentation level between sectors contributed to explain 10 % to 18 % of this recent drop in the per capita income and labor remuneration?s inequality degree, respectively. Together, the reductions in the discrimination and segmentation levels were responsible for 35 % of the inequality drop regarding the labor remuneration, being the discrimination reduction responsible for about 10 % and the segmentation reduction for about 25 %. Regarding the drop in the per capita income?s inequality, the reductions in the discrimination and segmentation?s degree were responsible, together, for 18 %, being the discrimination responsible for 4 % and the segmentation for the other 14 %. At last, we see that, regarding the reduction in the discrimination and segmentation levels, a lot of them still remains extremely high, such as the gender <b>differencials</b> and the formal-informal segmentation degree. In both cases, the difference between workers with identical characteristics in similar jobs is above 40 %. ...|$|R

First generation Explorers were equipped with the then new [...] 4.0 L Cologne V-6, manufactured in Cologne, Germany. Vehicles came with either Ford's own 4-speed A4LD automatic transmission, built in France, or Mazda's 5-speed M5OD manual transmission. Like the Bronco II it replaced, it was an SUV derivative of the Ranger pickup, thus Explorers came equipped {{with many of the}} Ranger's optional features. Like its direct competitor, the Chevrolet S-10 Blazer, Explorers were available in both 2-door and 4-door body styles and being equipped with either rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. The four-wheel drive versions were equipped with a Borg Warner 13-54 part-time four-wheel drive transfer case.

50|$|After {{returning}} from England and France with the New Zealand test side, during the 2010 pre-season {{and following the}} retirement of Canterbury great Hazem El Masri, Goodwin was chosen to be the Bulldogs' new goal-kicker. Goodwin didn't play in the Bulldogs {{first game of the}} 2010 season due to injury. In Goodwin's first appearance for Canterbury in the new decade, he kicked his first goal for the club against the St.George Illawarra Dragons in round 2 at WIN Stadium in Wollongong. The next week, he scored six goals in Canterbury's 60-14 victory over the Sydney Roosters at ANZ Stadium. He scored his first try of the 2010 season and scored two goals in round 4 in Canterbury's 38-16 loss to the South Sydney Rabbitohs at ANZ Stadium. In round 7, Goodwin scored two tries and kicked six goals in Canterbury's 36-18 victory at ANZ Stadium against the Brisbane Broncos. Goodwin scored a try and booted six goals in Canterbury's 32-12 victory over the South Sydney Rabbitohs at ANZ Stadium. In the 2010 season he ended up with a total of 6 tries and kicked 73 goals for 170 points and Canterbury finished in thirteenth place. In the opening game of the 2011 season, Goodwin scored four goals in Canterbury's 24-14 win over the Wests Tigers at ANZ Stadium. The next week against the South Sydney Rabbitohs at ANZ Stadium, Goodwin scored a try off a kick and scored four goals in the Bulldogs 28-19 victory. In Canterbury's 36-24 win over the South Sydney Rabbitohs in round 7 at ANZ Stadium, Goodwin got injured and was ruled out for several weeks. Goodwin returned in round 11 in Canterbury's 20-12 loss to the Canberra Raiders at Canberra Stadium. In round 16 Goodwin was dropped {{for the first time since}} he joined the club. The last time Goodwin played in Reserve Grade was in 2008 while he was at the Cronulla Sutherland Sharks. Goodwin made his first ever appearance in Reserve Grade for the Bulldogs in round 16 in their 32-15 win against the North Sydney Bears at North Sydney Oval. In that game Goodwin scored his first ever Reserve Grade try for the club and kicked 4 goals. Goodwin played the rest of the 2011 season in Reserve Grade which included playing for Canterbury in their 30-28 NSW Cup Grand Final win over the Auckland Vulcans, where he kicked 3 goals which helped the Canterbury Reserve Grade side win their 3rd successive Reserve Grade premiership in a row. His 2011 first grade season total ended up scoring 1 try and kicked 24 goals for 52 points and Canterbury finished in ninth place, missing out on the finals on points <b>differencial.</b> Goodwin began the 2012 season in first grade under new Canterbury coach Des Hasler and scored his first try in the opening game in Canterbury's 22-14 victory over the Penrith Panthers at Penrith. His next try came the next week in Canterbury's 30-4 win over the St. George Illawarra Dragons at ANZ Stadium. His third try came in the Bulldogs 46-12 win over rivals the Parramatta Eels at ANZ Stadium. His next and last first grade try for the club came in Canterbury's 12-10 loss to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles at ANZ Stadium. In round 11 in Canterbury's easy 26-6 victory over the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, Goodwin injured his spleen in a collision with Sharks fullack Matthew Wright. The injury was career threatening. That match proved to be Goodwin's last ever first grade game for the club. Goodwin was out of action for a number of months and finally returned, to play the rest of the 2012 season in Reserve Grade. Goodwin's last ever game for the club was in the NSW Cup Preliminary Final in Canterbury's 34-6 loss to the Newtown Jets at Leichhardt Oval, where he kicked his last ever goal for the club. His 1st grade 2012 season total ended up with him scoring 4 tries and kicked 14 goals for 44 points.|$|E
