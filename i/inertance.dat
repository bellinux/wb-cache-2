40|$|Car weight {{reduction}} {{is becoming more}} and more important for every kind of vehicle: minor mass implies, in fact, minor consumption, makes easier to fulfill homologation rules and assures a better handling behavior. Despite that, several vehicle missions have always been solved by adding more mass, e. g. NVH. In this paper, a methodology to optimize the stiffness distribution is proposed in order to obtain better vibrational performances without increasing the mass. At first, the problem has been solved for a simple beam using finite element and optimization algorithms. At a second stage, the optimal moment of inertia distribution found has been applied to a chassis thanks to a topometry optimization.

A study {{was done to}} design a supporting modular structure with comparable <b>inertances</b> {{with respect to a}} vehicle's actual suspension and body connection points. For the indoor test, the rear axle is positioned on a rotating drum. The suspension system is excited as the wheel passes over cleats fixed on the drum and transient wheel motions are recorded. The indoor test rig outputs (i. e., wheel and chassis accelerations) were compared with experimental data measured on an actual vehicle running at different speeds on the same set of cleats along a flat road. The comparison results validate the indoor testing method. The forces and moments acting at each suspension and chassis connection point were measured with a set of patented six-axis load cells. The forces, moments, wheel and subframe accelerations were measured up to 120 Hz. This study yielded a set of performance indexes by analyzing the forces and acceleration measured on the suspension system (the force measure is possible only on the indoor test rig).

40|$|According to the World Health Organization, 15 {{million people}} suffer stroke {{worldwide}} each year, of these, 5 million die and 5 million are permanently disabled. Stroke {{is therefore a}} major cause of mortality world-wide. The majority of strokes are caused by a blood clot that occludes an artery in the brain, and although thrombolytic agents such as Alteplase are used to dissolve clots that arise in the arteries of the brain, there are limitations on the use of these thrombolytic agents. However over the past decade, other methods of treatment have been developed which include Thrombectomy Devices e. g. the 'GP' Thrombus Aspiration Device ('GP' TAD). Such devices may be used as an alternative to thrombolytics or in conjunction with them to extract blood clots in arteries such as the middle cerebral artery of the midbrain brain, and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) of the posterior aspect of the brain. In this paper, we mathematically model the removal of blood clots using the 'GP' TAD from selected arteries of the brain where blood clots may arise taking into account factors such as the resistances, compliances and <b>inertances</b> effects.

40|$|Purpose: In this work, {{we present}} the analysis, design and {{optimization}} of one experimental device recently {{developed in the}} UK, called the 'GP' Thrombus Aspiration Device (GPTAD). This device {{has been designed to}} remove blood clots without the need to make contact with the clot itself thereby potentially reducing the risk of problems such as downstream embolisation. Method: To obtain the minimum pressure necessary to extract the clot and to optimize the device, we have simulated the performance of the GPTAD analysing the resistances, compliances and <b>inertances</b> effects. We model a range of diameters for the GPTAD considering different forces of adhesion of the blood clot to the artery wall, and different lengths of blood clot. In each case we determine the optimum pressure required to extract the blood clot from the artery using the GPTAD, which is attached at its proximal end to a suction pump. Result: We then compare the results of our mathematical modelling to measurements made in laboratory using plastic tube models of arteries of comparable diameter. We use abattoir porcine blood clots that are extracted using the GPTAD. The suction pressures required for such clot extraction in the plastic tube models compare favourably with those predicted by the mathematical modelling. Discussion & Conclusion: We conclude therefore that the mathematical modelling is a useful technique in predicting the performance of the GPTAD and may potentially be used in optimising the design of the device...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Stage one {{reconstruction}} (Norwood operation) for hypoplastic left heart syndrome can {{be performed}} with either a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt or a right ventricle-pulmonary artery shunt. Both methods have certain inherent characteristics. It is postulated that mathematic modeling could help elucidate these differences. METHODS: Three-dimensional computer models of the Blalock-Taussig shunt and right ventricle-pulmonary artery shunt modifications of the Norwood operation were developed by using the finite volume method. Conduits of 3, 3. 5, and 4 mm {{were used in the}} Blalock-Taussig shunt model, whereas conduits of 4, 5, and 6 mm were used in the right ventricle-pulmonary artery shunt model. The hydraulic nets (lumped resistances, compliances, <b>inertances,</b> and elastances) were identical in the 2 models. A multiscale approach was adopted to couple the 3 -dimensional models with the circulation net. Computer simulations were compared with postoperative catheterization data. RESULTS: Good correlation was found between predicted and observed data. For the right ventricle-pulmonary artery shunt modification, there was higher aortic diastolic pressure, decreased pulmonary artery pressure, lower Qp/Qs ratio, and higher coronary perfusion pressure. Mathematic modeling predicted minimal regurgitant flow in the right ventricle-pulmonary artery shunt model, which correlated with postoperative Doppler measurements. The right ventricle-pulmonary artery shunt demonstrated lower stroke work and a higher mechanical efficiency (stroke work/total mechanical energy). CONCLUSIONS: The close correlation between predicted and observed data supports the use of mathematic modeling in the design and assessment of surgical procedures.

40|$|Past {{studies in}} humans {{and other species}} have {{revealed}} the presence of resonances and antiresonances, i. e., minima and maxima in respiratory system impedance (Zrs), at frequencies much higher than those commonly employed in clinical applications of the forced oscillation technique (FOT). To help understand the mechanisms behind the first occurrence of antiresonance in the Zrs spectrum, the frequency response of the rat was studied by using FOT at both low and high frequencies. We measured Zrs in both Wistar and PVG/c rats using the wave tube technique, with a FOT signal ranging from 2 to 900 Hz. We then compared the high-frequency parameters, i. e., the first antiresonant frequency (far, 1) and the resistive part of Zrs at that frequency [Rrs(far, 1) ], with parameters obtained by fitting a modified constant-phase model to low-frequency Zrs spectra. The far, 1 was 570 +/- 43 (SD) Hz and 456 +/- 16 Hz in Wistar and PVG/c rats, respectively, {{and it did not}} shift with respiratory gases of different densities (air, heliox, and a, mixture of SF 6). The far, 1 and Rrs-(far, 1) were relatively independent of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction but changed significantly with increasing transrespiratory pressures up to 20 cmH(2) O, {{in the same way as}} airway resistance but independently of changes to tissue parameters. These results suggest that, unlike the human situation, the first antiresonance in the rat is not primarily dependent on the acoustic dimensions of the respiratory system and can be explained by interactions between compliances and <b>inertances</b> localized to the airways, but this most likely does not include airway wall compliance...|$|R

The phase shift provided by an <b>inertance</b> tube is strongly influenced by {{the temperature of the}} <b>inertance</b> tube and the acoustic power at the cold end of the regenerator. For a 4 K Stirling type pulse tube cryocooler, the acoustic power at the cold end of the regenerator decreases significantly with the temperature thereby it's difficult to achieve ideal phase relationship with ambient <b>inertance</b> tube. While cold <b>inertance</b> tube provide a larger phase shift in that the viscosity of the working fluid decreases and the density increases as the temperature decreases.

40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professor Gregory Nellis; 153 pp. Three models describing and predicting the <b>inertance</b> effect in <b>inertance</b> tubes for pulse tube refrigerators are presented in this thesis. All models take the <b>inertance,</b> the compliance, and the resistance associated with oscillating gas flow in the <b>inertance</b> tube into account. The first model is based on electrical transmission line theory, the second is based on lumped components in which the resistance, compliance, and <b>inertance</b> are each represented by a single, lumped component in a network. The third model, introduced {{for the first time}} here, divides the <b>inertance</b> tube into a number of smaller tubes with each smaller tube represented by a resistance, compliance, and <b>inertance</b> element. The distributed lumped components can be combined in a network and used to predict mass flow, pressure, and their phase in the <b>inertance</b> tube. To verify these models, the mass flow rate and pressure characteristics are measured for a number of different <b>inertance</b> tube geometries at different experimental conditions. The instantaneous pressure at various locations and the mass flow rate at the terminating end of the <b>inertance</b> tube can be measured relatively easily. The mass flow rate at the pulse tube end of the <b>inertance</b> tube presented a challenge and several techniques were used to measure this quantity. A commercially available, hot film anemometer was modified in order to measure the rather high mass flow into the <b>inertance</b> tube and withstand the high operating pressure. Unfortunately this modified anemometer failed to measure the true mass flow under oscillating flow conditions. Two methods of indirectly measuring the mass flow exiting the compressor were introduced. Although these two methods were shown to be capable of measuring the mass flow correctly under certain limiting conditions, they failed to accurately measure the mass flow rate consistently over a range of operating conditions. Therefore, the models are ultimately verified primarily through careful comparison with those quantities that can be easily and reliably measured; specifically the pressure variation {{along the length of the}} <b>inertance</b> tube and the mass flow rate into the reservoir. These experimental quantities are shown to be in good agreement with the model's predictions over a range of operating conditions. Design charts are generated with the experimentally verified, distributed component model and are presented for various operating conditions in order to ease the design of <b>inertance</b> tubes for pulse tube refrigerators with kW-level refrigeration power. These design charts enable the designer to select <b>inertance</b> tube geometry that achieves a desired phase shift for a given level of acoustic power...|$|E
40|$|Multiscale {{computing}} is {{a challenging}} area even in biomechanics. Application {{of such a}} methodology to quantitatively compare postoperative hemodynamics in congenital heart diseases is very promising. In the treatment of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which is a congenital heart disease where the left ventricle is missing or very small, the necessity to feed the pulmonary and systemic circulations is obtained with an interposition shunt. Two main options are available and differ from the sites of anastomoses: (i) the systemic-to-pulmonary conduit (Blalock–Taussig shunt known as the Norwood Operation (NO)) connecting the innominate artery (NO-BT) or the aorta (NO-CS) to the right pulmonary artery and (ii) the right ventricle to pulmonary artery shunt (known as Sano operation (SO)). The proposition that the SO is superior to the NO remains controversial. 3 -D computer models of the NO (NO-BT and NO-CS) and SO were developed and investigated using the finite volume method. Conduits of 3, 3. 5 and 4 mm {{were used in the}} NO models, whereas conduits of 4, 5 and 6 mm were used in the SO model.

40|$|The {{complete}} {{equation of}} motion for a single compartment model (SCM) includes an <b>inertance</b> term to describe pressure changes in phase with acceleration, as well as terms for resistance and elastance. <b>Inertance</b> has traditionally been excluded from the model when measuring respiratory mechanics at conventional ventilatory frequencies in mature respiratory systems. However, this omission has been questioned recently for measurements of respiratory mechanics in intubated infants where higher ventilation frequencies and smaller tracheal tubes are the norm. We investigated 1) the significance of <b>inertance</b> in an immature respiratory system during mechanical ventilation, and 2) the effect of omitting it from the model on estimates of respiratory mechanics. Six anesthetised, paralysed and mechanically ventilated puppies (2. 6 - 3. 9 kg) were studied. A SCM, including an <b>inertance</b> term was fitted to measurements of flow and airway opening (P(AO)) or transpulmonary (P(TP)) pressure using multiple linear regression to estimate respiratory system and lung resistance (R(RS), R(L)), elastance (E(RS), E(L)) and <b>inertance</b> (I(RS), I(L)) respectively, at various ventilation frequencies (0. 2 - 2 Hz). Data obtained at each ventilation frequency were also fitted with a similar model without the <b>inertance</b> term. <b>Inertance</b> {{contributed significantly to the}} model at frequencies greater than approximately 0. 3 - 0. 5 Hz (20 - 30 breaths per minute), with I(RS) dominated by the lung.

40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. The {{efficiency}} and cooling power of pulse tube refrigerators are {{highly dependent on}} the phase angle between the mass flow and pressure waves used to produce cooling. <b>Inertance</b> tubes are commonly used to set the phase angle for optimal efficiency.

40|$|In {{hydraulic}} systems with multiple actuators, difficulty can arise with matching the load requirements with the supply {{power from the}} system's pump. To get the desired performance at the individual loads, restrictive type valves are used to control pressure or flow by throttling the flow over a spool orifice, creating considerable power loss. This causes {{hydraulic systems}} powered off the same pump to be inefficient. Switched <b>inertance</b> hydraulic systems are a new technology {{in the field of}} fluid power that convert pressure and flow more efficiently than using restrictive type hydraulic valves. The step-down, or "buck", converter considered exclusively in this thesis has the ability to reduce pressure and increase flow rate to a load. The system is constructed using a digital hydraulic valve and check valve connected to the pressure supply and system reservoir respectfully. Following the valves, the system has an <b>inertance</b> tube, a long piece of uniform hydraulic line where fluid inertia is built up. The <b>inertance</b> tube also causes pressure wave propagation effects to occur since the length of the line is typically long. The performance of switched <b>inertance</b> converters are largely governed by the performance of the switching valve. An ideal switched <b>inertance</b> converter is 100 % efficient at converting pressure and flow, however this would require the valve to actuate at extremely high frequency and switch instantaneously fast. This is not realizable as real valves operate up to a maximum of a couple hundred Hertz, and take a finite time to open and close, on the order of milliseconds. One of the main losses of a buck converter is the power loss across the switching valve as it transitions from open to closed and vice versa. This loss arises from the throttling of flow over the valve opening during actuation. The research presented in this thesis looks at mitigating this loss, as well as the viscous friction loss within the <b>inertance</b> tube. These losses can be reduced by using an <b>inertance</b> tube of variable shape, a new idea introduced very recently. A shaped <b>inertance</b> tube is a fluid pipeline with varying cross sectional area over its length, as compared to uniform <b>inertance</b> tubes which have constant cross sectional area. The current gap in the research is that the tube design is not fully optimized leaving room for potential improvements in identifying better dimensions, or perhaps finding a more optimal shape. Models for computing fluid transients in uniform lines are well developed, however modelling fluid dynamics in shaped <b>inertance</b> tubes is an area that has not been studied as extensively. The research presented proposes a computer model for simulating fluid transients in tapered transmission line segments using the transmission line method (TLM). The current research gap in modelling tapered transmission lines is that previous models are difficult to simulate in the time domain, have poor accuracy, and have a limited range of applicability. The proposed TLM model looks to mitigate these shortcomings. When connected in succession, the tapered TLM can model shaped <b>inertance</b> tubes for application to hydraulic buck converters. The proposed model shows improved agreement to a numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations than the previous models on the topic. Validation of the model is also gained though analysis of the dynamic response in the frequency domain. With the model now available to simulate shaped <b>inertance</b> tubes, a buck converter system is defined with equations presented for dynamic simulation. Initial simulations of the buck converter using parameters and design from previous research showed unoptimized performance operating at an efficiency of 47. 8 % for a system using a uniform <b>inertance</b> tube. The main objective was to optimize the shape of the <b>inertance</b> tube to realize increased performance using simulation studies. Genetic and pattern search algorithms were used to optimize the dimensions of the <b>inertance</b> tube with the goal of maximizing system efficiency while maintaining the same load. As a baseline, the uniform intertance tube design was optimized, and realized an efficiency of 64. 1 %, performing significantly better than the unoptimized uniform <b>inertance</b> tube. Further optimizations added an increasing number of tapered sections to describe the arbitrary shape of an <b>inertance</b> tube, up to 4 tapered segments. Significant efficiency increases were realized when using shaped <b>inertance</b> tubes. The best tube design increased system efficiency over 6 % compared to the uniform design at a value of 70. 2 %. Other optimizations showed improvements in efficiency over the traditional design by reducing both valve and frictional losses in the system. The research presents a novel <b>inertance</b> tube design, containing a uniform section of high <b>inertance</b> followed by a diverging tapered section followed by another uniform section at larger diameter and low resistance. This design also proposes the idea of potential noise reduction due to the suppression of pressure fluctuations at the load...|$|E

40|$|Presented at the 16 th International Cryocooler Conference, held May 17 - 20, 2008 in Atlanta, Georgia. Phase {{characteristics}} of an <b>inertance</b> pulse tube cryocooler (IPTC) mainly include the mass flows, the pressure amplitudes, and the phase shifts between them. These are decisive factors for cooler performance, and are strongly affected by {{variations in the}} <b>inertance</b> tube design. In this work we describe theoretical analyses and experimental studies carried out on the phase {{characteristics of}} a large capacity high frequency single-stage IPTC developed in our laboratory and operated {{with a variety of}} <b>inertance</b> tube geometries at 80 K. The theoretical analyses focused on investigating the amplitudes and phase angles at various locations of the whole system and established the phasor relationship of the cooler by combining a phasor-type analysis and a REGEN 3. 2 analysis. The COP was calculated, and the influence on compressor efficiency was analyzed based on a force balance and Ohm’s law. The experimental study stressed evaluating the phase characteristics of the cooler by making a few easy measurements of the key parameters. The measurements included the compressor piston position using LVDT (linear variable differential transformer) rods, the pressure amplitudes—in the reservoir, at outlet of compressor, and the warm end of the pulse tube — using pressure transducers, and the phase angles between them. The measured results are compared with the theoretical predictions. Both the theoretical and experimental investigations imply that the change of the <b>inertance</b> characteristics have a great influence on the pressure difference, cooling power, the efficiency of the cold finger, and the efficiency of the compressor. It is concluded that optimization of the <b>inertance</b> tube should consider both the cold finger efficiency and the compressor efficiency at the same time, in order to achieve an optimum efficiency of the overall IPTC...|$|E
40|$|Fluid inertia within passageways of {{hydraulic}} components {{is known}} to {{have a significant impact on}} their dynamic response and fluid-borne noise characteristics. This <b>inertance</b> is often hard to quantify either theoretically or experimentally due to the complex nature of component geometries, and bacause it is related to dynamic, not steady-state behaviour. Previous studies have used the secondary source method to determine the impedance, of which the <b>inertance</b> is an important parameter, of components such as positive displacement pumps and valves. A simple acoustic test for predicting the <b>inertance</b> of a component is proposed. The component must have a direct connection between inlet and outlet, and as such is directly applicable to valves and accumulators. Results were compared to theory for known components, including uniform pipes, and woth predictions made using the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package ANSYS CFX, using the anology of steady state flow through porous passageways of identical geometry. In general, good agreement between acoustic measurements and CFD predictions was obtained for a number of ball valves, gate valves and an accumulator poppet valve...|$|E
40|$|The changes {{occurring}} in breathing mechanics of exercising ponies when heliox is substituted for air are reported. Respiratory airflow, tidal volume (VT) and transpulmonary pressure (Ptp) were simultaneously measured in 5 healthy ponies (255 ± 15 kg) at rest (breathing air) {{and while they}} exercised for 6 min on a treadmill. During exercise they first breathed air (2 min), than heliox (2 min) and then air again (2 min). Tidal volume (VT), respiratory rate (fR), minute volume (VE), maximum Ptp changes, total pulmonary resistance (RJ, mechanical work of Breathing per liter (Wrm l'), mechanical work per min (Wrm), dynamic compliance and pulmonary <b>inertance</b> were calculated. Heliox breathing significantly increased f,, and VE while VT remained unchanged. RL was reduced by 50 % of lis "air value", Wrm I-' decreased, while Wrm remained unchanged. Pulmonary <b>inertance</b> dropped to 30 % of its "air value". These observations suggest that in ponies, turbulent resistance and pulmonary <b>inertance</b> could be mainly responsible for the increases of RL and Wrm 1 ' during exercisePeer reviewe...|$|E
