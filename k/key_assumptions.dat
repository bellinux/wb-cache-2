500|$|Fresh {{work in the}} 1970s and 1980s {{challenged}} both Postan's and Marxist {{approaches to}} the medieval economy. Local studies of medieval economics, often in considerable detail and fusing new archaeological techniques and rescue archaeology with historical sources, often ran counter to their broader interpretations of change and development. The degree to which feudalism really existed and operated in England after the initial years of the invasion was thrown into considerable doubt, with historians such as David Crouch arguing that it existed primarily as a legal and fiscal model, rather than an actual economic system. Sociological and anthropological studies of contemporary economies, including the work of Ester Boserup showed many flaws with Postan's <b>key</b> <b>assumptions</b> about demography and land use. The current academic preference is to see the English medieval economy as an [...] "overlapping network of diverse communities", in which active local choices and decisions {{are the result of}} independent agency, rather than a result of historically deterministic processes.|$|E
500|$|Jones's {{recommendations}} {{were based on}} a number of <b>key</b> <b>assumptions</b> about the threats faced in particular sectors of the fortifications. First, the North Front was so strongly defended that it was very unlikely to be vulnerable. Second, the sea defences below the South Bastion could be breached but an invader would still face the barrier of the South Front. Third, the Europa defences might also be breached, but a defender holding the narrow Europa Pass or the heights of Windmill Hill could easily enfilade an invader; as Jones put it, [...] "two hundred men on Windmill Hill and Europa Pass ought to hold as many thousands at bay". Fourth, the main threat was – as Green had recognised 80 years earlier – to the town itself. An enemy breaching the sea wall in the town would bypass the two land fronts and be able to attack them from their highly vulnerable rear.|$|E

2500|$|Peter Drucker {{wrote in}} 1994 about the [...] "Theory of the Business," [...] which {{represents}} the <b>key</b> <b>assumptions</b> underlying a firm's strategy. [...] These assumptions are in three categories: a) the external environment, including society, market, customer, and technology; b) {{the mission of the}} organization; and c) the core competencies needed to accomplish the mission. He continued that a valid theory of the business has four specifications: 1) assumptions about the environment, mission, and core competencies must fit reality; 2) the assumptions in all three areas have to fit one another; 3) the theory of the business must be known and understood throughout the organization; and 4) the theory of the business has to be tested constantly.|$|E
2500|$|Fogel makes several <b>key</b> <b>assumptions</b> and {{decisions}} in his analysis. First, his calculations comprise transportation between the primary markets of the Midwest and the secondary markets of the East and South (interregional) and transportation between cities {{and rural areas}} (intraregional). Second, he chooses {{to focus on the}} shipment of four agricultural commodities: wheat, corn, beef, and pork. Third, Fogel’s social saving calculation accounts for costs not included in water rates (which include the cargo losses in transit, transshipment costs, extra wagon haulage, time lost because of slower speed and because canals froze in the winter, and capital costs). One criticism [...] of Fogel’s analysis {{is that it does not}} account for the externalities or [...] "spill-over" [...] effects of the railroads, which (if included) may have increased his estimate for social savings [...] Railroads provided much of the demand for the technological advances in a number of areas, including heat dynamics, combustion engineering, thermodynamics, metallurgy, civil engineering, machining, and metal fabrication. Furthermore, Fogel does not discuss the role railroads played in the development of the financial system or in attracting foreign capital, which otherwise might not have been available.|$|E

2500|$|The EPR paper {{generated}} significant {{interest among}} physicists and inspired much {{discussion about the}} foundations of quantum mechanics (perhaps most famously Bohm's interpretation of quantum mechanics), but produced relatively little other published work. So, despite the interest, the weak point in EPR's argument was not discovered until 1964, when John Stewart Bell proved {{that one of their}} <b>key</b> <b>assumptions,</b> the principle of locality, which underlies the kind of hidden variables interpretation hoped for by EPR, was mathematically inconsistent with the predictions of quantum theory. Specifically, he demonstrated an upper limit, seen in Bell's inequality, regarding the strength of correlations that can be produced in any theory obeying local realism, and he showed that quantum theory predicts violations of this limit for certain entangled systems. His inequality is experimentally testable, and there have been numerous relevant experiments, starting with the pioneering work of Stuart Freedman and John Clauser in 1972 and Alain Aspect's experiments in 1982, all of which have shown agreement with quantum mechanics rather than the principle of local realism. [...] Until recently each had left open at least one loophole by which it was possible to question the validity of the results. [...] However, in 2015 the first loophole-free experiment was performed, which ruled out a large class of local realism theories with certainty.|$|E

We consider restrictions on these direct effects that allow for point identification of the effect of interest. The setup leads to new insights concerning the properties of conventional estimators, novel identification strategies, and new estimators to exploit those strategies. A <b>key</b> <b>assumption</b> underlying the main identification strategy is that the product of the direct effects of the instruments on the outcome and the effects of the instruments on the endogenous regressor has expectation zero.
