500|$|Daniel Boone died {{of natural}} causes, other sources, from acute {{indigestion}} on September 26, 1820, at Nathan Boone's home on Femme Osage Creek, 2-1/2 months short of his 86th birthday. His last words were, [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>now.</b> My time has come." [...] He was buried next to Rebecca, who had died on March 18, 1813. The graves, which were unmarked until the mid-1830s, were near Jemima (Boone) Callaway's home on Tuque Creek, about two miles (3km) from the present-day Marthasville, Missouri. In 1845, the Boones' remains were supposedly disinterred and reburied in a new cemetery Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky. Resentment in Missouri about the disinterment grew over the years, and a legend arose that Boone's remains never left Missouri. According to this story, Boone's tombstone in Missouri had been inadvertently placed over the wrong grave, {{but no one had}} ever corrected the error. Boone's relatives in Missouri, displeased with the Kentuckians who came to exhume Boone, kept quiet about the mistake, and they allowed the Kentuckians to dig up the wrong remains. No contemporary evidence indicates this actually happened, but in 1983, a forensic anthropologist examined a crude plaster cast of Boone's skull made before the Kentucky reburial and announced it might be the skull of an African American. Black slaves had also been buried at Tuque Creek, so it is possible the wrong remains were mistakenly removed from the crowded graveyard. Both the Frankfort Cemetery in Kentucky and the Old Bryan Farm graveyard in Missouri claim to have Boone's remains.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1925 season, veteran Detroit {{sports writer}} Sam Greene was {{ebullient}} in his praise for Tavener's defensive performance:"The midget from Fort Worth proceeded to show Detroit fans the flashiest work at shortstop they had seen since Donie Bush was in his prime. [...] He cut off base hit after base hit, <b>going</b> <b>now</b> far to his right side and now to his left. [...] When occasion demanded, he roamed into left field for fly balls that previously had gone for base hits. [...] While Tavener was a light hitter, his defensive skill more than off-set his weakness on attack. Detroit [...] [...] [...] needed someone to discourage the offense of the opposition. [...] Tavener did that as few young infielders have ever done it." ...|$|E
