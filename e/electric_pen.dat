When Jehl worked for Lowrey he was {{responsible}} for making multiple copies {{of a wide range of}} documents pertaining to Edison's <b>electric</b> <b>pen.</b> One of the other duties that came with Jehl's employment with Lowrey was overseeing the care of Bunsen cells which happened to occupy the current of the <b>electric</b> <b>pen.</b> This was particularly important.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{producers}} {{have used a}} wide variety of measures to combat predation. Pre-modern shepherds used their own presence, livestock guardian dogs, and protective structures such as barns and fencing. Fencing (both regular and <b>electric),</b> <b>penning</b> sheep at night and lambing indoors all continue to be widely used. More modern shepherds used guns, traps, and poisons to kill predators, causing significant decreases in predator populations. In the wake of the environmental and conservation movements, the use of these methods now usually falls under the purview of specially designated government agencies in most developed countries.|$|R

Pre-modern shepherds had only the most basic of tools: their own presence, livestock guardian dogs, and [...] protective structures such as barns and fencing. Fencing (both regular and <b>electric),</b> <b>penning</b> sheep at night and lambing indoors all continue to be widelyused methods of protection today. Whereas sheepdogs herd sheep, guardian dogs are trained to integrate into flocks and protect them from predators. The ability of these dogs to do so is a transference of the canine pack social structure on to a flock. Following their invention, the focus in dealing with predators shifted to the nearly exclusive use of guns, traps, and poisons to kill predators both defensively and preemptively. The population of predator species plummeted worldwide, pushing some to extinction (such as the thylacine) or significantly reducing their original ranges. With the appearance of the environmental and conservation movements, and subsequent state, provincial, national and international legislation, simply exterminating predator species failed to be a legally viable option for protecting flocks. However, many countries maintain government agenciessuch as the Wildlife Services program, a wing of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to shoot, poison and trap predators that threaten sheep. Wildlife conservation organizations charge that this killing is both indiscriminate and ineffective at protecting sheep.|$|R

The Chicago manufacturer went on to create the mimeograph, an <b>electric</b> <b>pen</b> spin-off marketed specifically as [...] "Edison’s Mimeograph" [...] under his permission. Unlike the <b>electric</b> <b>pen,</b> the mimeograph sold with relative success, and the A.B. Dick Company remained in business until ending in 2004.|$|E

50|$|In 1891 {{the first}} {{electric}} tattoo needle {{was invented in}} New York City by modifying Thomas Edison's <b>electric</b> engraving <b>pen.</b> This made the process cheaper and faster; it was {{taken up by the}} poor and abandoned by the rich. O'Reilly's machine was based on the rotary technology of the electric engraving device invented by Thomas Edison. Modern tattoo machines use electromagnetic coils. The first coil machine was patented by Thomas Riley in London in 1891, using a single coil. The first twin-coil machine, the predecessor of the modern configuration, was invented by another Englishman, Alfred Charles South of London, in 1899.|$|R
5000|$|Hiratsuka has a mixed economy, {{with tax}} revenue coming from wagers made at Shonan Bank Cycling Velodrome, and several {{industries}} located in industrial {{parks in the}} outskirts of town. Major plants are operated by Nissan Shatai, Yokohama Rubber Company, Canon, Furukawa <b>Electric,</b> Pilot (<b>pen</b> company) (the famous Namiki pens are produced at Kiratsuka), Kansai Paint, and Mitsubishi Plastics. Nissan Shatai produced the largest employment on the City, but announced the plan to let a factory move to Kanda. Western firms such as Moog and MacDermid Performance Solutions also have a strong presence in this city. Hiratsuka is also a bedroom community for Yokohama and Tokyo, with residents attracted by the [...] "Shōnan lifestyle".|$|R
50|$|Thomas Edison's <b>electric</b> <b>pen,</b> {{part of a}} {{complete}} outfit for duplicating handwritten documents and drawings, was the first relatively safe electric motor driven office appliance produced and sold in the United States.|$|E
50|$|The <b>electric</b> <b>pen</b> {{was the key}} {{component}} of a complete duplicating system, which included the pen, a cast-iron holder with a wooden insert, a wet cell battery on a cast-iron stand, and a cast-iron flatbed duplicating press with ink roller. All the cast-iron parts were black japanned, with gold striping or decoration. The hand-held <b>electric</b> <b>pen</b> was powered by a wet cell battery, which was wired to an electric motor mounted {{on top of a}} pen-like shaft. The motor drove a reciprocating needle which, according to the manual, could make 50 punctures per second, or 3,000 per minute. The user was instructed to place the stencil on firm blotting paper on a flat surface, then use the pen to write or draw naturally to form words and designs as a series of minute perforations in the stencil.|$|E
50|$|The {{need for}} {{batteries}} in the <b>electric</b> <b>pen</b> ultimately caused its steady decline, as mechanical pens {{that did not}} require batteries to operate took over the market by 1880. These pens, along with other cheaper and simpler stencil-making technologies quickly became more popular and widely used, until all were eventually overtaken by the typewriter by the late 1880s.|$|E
50|$|The {{day before}} Christmas Eve, Pietari's father Rauno, a local {{reindeer}} slaughterer, digs a trap pit {{in the yard}} to protect the remaining reindeer in case of wolves. He wakes Pietari up by shooting at his window and tells him to prepare for rounding up reindeer herds with the other herders at the <b>electric</b> reindeer <b>pen.</b> This year, {{there were only two}} skinny reindeer runts, so Rauno and the herders go to a glacier by Korvantunturi. When they reach there they find the remains of hundreds of reindeer that were gnawed to the bone. It looks like the explosions that have been going on at the fell for months have driven the wolves in the area mad. Rauno, examines the carcasses worriedly. Farther away Pietari too examines the traces and is convinced that it's not the work of wolves, while Juuso warns him not to tell his father that they plied open the fence to Korvantunturi.|$|R
50|$|The tools {{traditionally}} {{used for}} the part preparation process are very elementary: writing utensils (pencils of various graphite hardness, colored pencils, ink pens, felt tipped <b>pens,</b> <b>electric</b> and manual erasers, correction fluid and tape), office supplies (pencil sharpeners, staplers, staple removers, scissors, rulers, drafting templates, straight-edges, non-yellowing permanent and removable adhesive tapes, paper clips, packing tape, shipping materials, and property stamps). Typical office equipment found in an ensemble library includes a high quality photocopier capable of copying and printing paper of various sizes in duplex; papers of different sizes, colors and weights; binding machines (tape, coil, wire or comb); paper cutters; and computer(s) with word processing, spreadsheet, database and music notation software.|$|R
50|$|Aside from companies, the <b>electric</b> <b>pen</b> {{was also}} marketed {{to the general}} public, with other uses for the {{invention}} being personal letters, pamphlets, music, contracts, circulars, and architectural and mechanical drawings among other types of documents. In late 1875, the pen was at first sold only in the East Coast of the United States at the starting price of $30. It was further spread to the Midwest, British Columbia, and England after its rise in popularity, when more than 150 pens were being sold monthly. The market continued to expand to Cuba and South America, with Europe and Asia being added by 1877. However, by 1880, the business for the <b>electric</b> <b>pen</b> started to decline when other inventions that were more efficient soon overtook Edison’s product in the market, causing it to eventually fall into obscurity. It is said that roughly 60,000 pens were sold throughout its commercial lifespan in total, however this number {{is likely to be}} made up by Edison in order to give the product more publicity.|$|E
50|$|The {{predecessor}} to {{the tattoo}} machine was the <b>electric</b> <b>pen</b> invented by Thomas Alva Edison and patented {{under the title}} Stencil-Pens in Newark, New Jersey, United States in 1876. It was originally intended {{to be used as}} a duplicating device, but in 1891, Samuel O'Reilly discovered that Edison's machine could be modified and used to introduce ink into the skin, and later patented a tube and needle system to provide an ink reservoir.|$|E
50|$|The {{exposition}} {{also featured}} many well-known items of today such as; Alexander Graham Bell's first telephone which {{was set up}} on opposite ends of Machinery Hall to demonstrate the transfer of human voice through wires, the Automatic telegraph system and <b>electric</b> <b>pen</b> by Thomas Edison, screw-cutting machines that drastically improved the production of screws and bolts from 8,000 to 100,000 a day, and a universal grinding machine by Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Co.|$|E
50|$|The major {{drawback}} to Edison’s <b>electric</b> <b>pen</b> was its wet cell battery, {{which had to}} be taken care of and maintained by experienced telegraphists. Due to its messy nature, it was important for Edison to incorporate batteries that were more acceptable to clerks who had to take care of the pen and its underlying machinery. Otherwise, the bankers and insurance people may never take interest in it, as said by Mullarkey, an ex-telegraph operator and New York agent for Edison.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas Edison {{received}} US patent 180,857 for Autographic Printing on August 8, 1876. [...] The patent {{covered the}} <b>electric</b> <b>pen,</b> used {{for making the}} stencil, and the flatbed duplicating press. In 1880 Edison obtained a further patent, US 224,665: [...] "Method of Preparing Autographic Stencils for Printing," [...] which covered the making of stencils using a file plate, a grooved metal plate on which the stencil was placed which perforated the stencil when written on with a blunt metal stylus.|$|E
5000|$|The {{quincunx}} as {{a tattoo}} {{is known as}} the five dots tattoo. It has been variously interpreted as a fertility symbol, a reminder of sayings on how to treat women or police, a recognition symbol among the Romani people, a group of close friends, standing alone in the world, or time spent in prison (with the outer four dots representing the prison walls and the inner dot representing the prisoner). Thomas Edison, whose many inventions included an <b>Electric</b> <b>pen</b> which later became the basis of a tattooing machine created by Samuel O'Reilly, had this pattern tattooed on his forearm.|$|E
50|$|Harold Brown {{graduated}} Chicago High School in 1876 {{and prepared}} to enroll in mining engineering courses at Harvard {{but was unable to}} since the great Chicago fire of 1871 had left his family in reduced circumstances. After high school he was employed at the The Western Electric Manufacturing Company of Chicago working on development and manufacturing of electrical devices, including Edison’s <b>electric</b> <b>pen</b> duplicating machine, from 1876 to 1879. From 1879 to 1884 he worked for Brush Electric Company in charge of designing and installing their arc lighting systems. From 1884 to 1887 he operated his own electrical consulting business, Brown Electric Company, where he worked in inventing improved arc lighting equipment.|$|E
50|$|Ziegler cites several {{physicians}} {{who contributed to}} the development of corneal tattooing. Some created new instruments to enhance the tattoo process. Taylor introduced one such method. He created a bundle of needles to tattoo the eye, instead of using a single needle; De Wecker found this method to be more practical. In 1901, Nieden introduced a method that used a tattooing needle based on the idea of a fountain pen, or something similar to the Edison <b>electric</b> <b>pen.</b> He found that this electrical needle operated more rapidly and reliably than traditional methods of tattooing. Another physician, Armaignac, used a small funnel that he fixed to the cornea by three small points. He would then put China ink into the instrument and tattoo with a needle. Armaignac claimed that his method produced a perfectly round pupil in one sitting. Other physicians, such as Victor Morax, did not tattoo the cornea, but changed its appearance using other methods. Morax split the corneal tissue into two vertical layers, introducing the coloring substance under the pedicle flap and placing a compressive dressing over the eye. Various methods have been introduced throughout history, collectively evolving into several mainstream methods that have proven to be the most effective to date.|$|E
40|$|In the 1870 s America was redefined. During {{these years}} {{following}} the Civil War, improved modes of communication and transportation drew the nation together and the United States forged a new national identity. American business experienced a similar transformation. Faster methods of producing and exchanging commodities and phenomenal growth {{in the size of}} manufacturing institutions enabled American businesses to change their focus from their traditional local markets to national and eventually international markets. This shift in markets held serious implications for the way Americans would invent and market their inventions. Inventors suddenly found it necessary to understand and address the needs of faceless customers from distant markets. As a result, in the 1870 s the business agent assumed an important new role in the process of invention. Inventors relied upon growing corps of business agents to gather and interpret customer feedback to ensure the success of their inventions on the new national market. The development of Thomas A. Edison's <b>electric</b> <b>pen</b> and duplicatin...|$|E
40|$|With the {{explosive}} growth {{of the internet and}} the change in consumer demand, post-PC is emerging as a substitute for the existing desktop PC and laptop PC. post-PC is a new computer which is portable with wireless networking, cheaper than the existing PC and specializing in the specific functions that consumers want. Rudimentary post-PCs such as PDA, web-pad and smart-phone are already in use. In the future, owing to technological progress, the heterogeneity of related companies and the low entry barrier, various post-PCs will be developed. This paper attempts to analyse consumers' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for post-PC with such attributes as portability, CPU speed, data input method (using key board or <b>electric</b> <b>pen),</b> monitor size, and price. To this end, a contingent ranking method is applied, which makes the respondents rank hypothetical post-PC alternatives featuring various combinations of attributes, via a survey data collected in Korea. Using the estimated WTP, the shape and the capacity of future post-PC are predicted and policy implications drawn for national- and company-level R&D strategies. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} develop safe and {{effective}} topical and transdermal formulations to treat either local skin disorders or for systemic drug delivery, it is first imperative to assess skin permeation using a reliable and comprehensive analysis method. The assessment of drug permeation into/across the skin is traditionally accomplished using Franz diffusion cells with subsequent analysis by conventional chromatographic methods such as HPLC and more recently using advanced imaging techniques. In this context, time of flight-secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) offers distinctive advantages in mapping drugs within skin with high sensitivity and chemical specificity {{without the need for}} fluorescent tags or radiolabels. The work in this thesis uses the combination of conventional and advanced methods to evaluate drug permeation into the skin. This approach provides complementary and detailed information regarding the permeated mass, the permeation depth and the spatial distribution and localisation of drugs within skin. As ToF-SIMS does not produce quantitative results, due to the matrix effects, a novel high throughput method was successfully developed to quantify ToF-SIMS data. This method involved the homogenisation of skin tissue followed by microarray printing of this skin homogenate with known concentrations of active pharmaceutical ingredients, specifically imiquimod and chlorhexidine. The subsequent analysis by ToF-SIMS of the resulting array allowed the generation of a calibration curve {{that can be used in}} the quantification of the unknown drug concentration in the tape strips. This work has demonstrated the potential of a method to quantify ToF-SIMS data of drugs within skin. Imiquimod is an immune modulator drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma (BCC) but not the nodular lesions. An assessment of imiquimod permeation from commercially available Aldara™ cream into ex vivo porcine skin was carried out using the complementary approach of HPLC and ToF-SIMS analysis. This work represents the most detailed assessment to date of the true extent of permeation of imiquimod from Aldara™ cream as previous studies analysed the permeation of Aldara™ cream showed a limitation in the analytical methodology employed (i. e. analysis by HPLC only). The results showed that imiquimod does permeate into the stratum corneum but is very limited in the deeper skin cell layers. In addition, the ToF-SIMS ion images of Aldara™ cream tape strips illustrated a non-uniform distribution of imiquimod within skin which may result in a decreased efficacy of the cream to uniformly treat whole BCC lesions giving rise to the likelihood of tumour recurrence. This offers previously unobserved insights about the spatial distribution of imiquimod delivered from Aldara™ cream. As other studies have reported that Aldara™ cream has some limitations in the treatment of nodular BCC lesions due to the cream’s inability to deliver imiquimod into the deeper more invasive nodular lesions, an enhancement of imiquimod permeation is thought to be useful to overcome these limitations. Therefore, an attempt to improve delivery of imiquimod into the deeper skin layers using microemulsions and microneedles was investigated. Imiquimod microemulsions were formulated, characterised and then tested for skin permeation enhancement. However, the assessment of imiquimod permeation from the formulated microemulsions alone and with microneedle pre-treatment using HPLC and ToF-SIMS demonstrated a limited ability of the microemulsions to improve delivery of imiquimod over Aldara™ cream. In contrast, Aldara™ cream with microneedle pre-treatment using a derma stamp <b>electric</b> <b>pen</b> showed improved delivery of imiquimod into the skin. This work is believed to be the first attempt to enhance imiquimod delivery using microemulsions and microneedles. Utilising the high sensitivity offered by the ToF-SIMS instrument in the analysis of individual tape strips, an in vivo and ex vivo comparison of chlorhexidine permeation into the stratum corneum was performed using commercial products currently used in hospitals within the UK for skin antisepsis. A comparison was carried out using the tape stripping technique with subsequent analysis of an individual tape strip by ToF-SIMS. The results showed that HiBiSCRUB® 4...|$|E
