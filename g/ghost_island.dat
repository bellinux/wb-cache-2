In present time, the Ghost Gang decides to pick the Golden Fruit off of the tree without knowing Spooky is under it. Spooky escapes and commands the gang to follow him in a plan to eliminate all of the Pac People. The Ghosts agree and steal the Golden Fruit. The next morning, Professor Pac tells Pac Man to retrieve the stolen Golden Fruit and imprison Spooky again or else Pac Land will be doomed. Pac Man travels through all four regions of Pac Land and across the ocean to <b>Ghost</b> <b>Island.</b> He defeats the four Ghost Gang members, in which they individually use four machines and a submarine to try and kill Pac Man and gets all five Golden Fruit along the way. When he arrives at the Ghost Bayou on <b>Ghost</b> <b>Island,</b> he meets the Wormwood; the evil brother of the Golden Fruit Tree, and he goes through a maze that Wormwood had created to stop him from defeating Spooky. Pac Man makes it through the maze, and as a result, Wormwood's fire inside of his hollow mouth of his trunk burns out and he dies. Upon returning to Pac Village, Pac Man learns the true power of the Golden Fruit and uses it to defeat Spooky. With Spooky defeated and re-sealed under the Golden Fruit Tree, Pac Man is congratulated by the residents of Pac Village, during which Chomp Chomp overhears the Ghost Gang planning to free Spooky again and gives chase.|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the success of}} the new <b>Ghost</b> <b>Island</b> diverge layout, which is an alternative design incorporating a wide 'tiger-tailed' <b>ghost</b> <b>island</b> painted area. It enables drivers to leave the motorway either at the first exit point entering slip lane 1 or at the second exit point entering slip lane 2. It has performed successfully as an anti-swooping measure at three UK sites monitored by the Transport Research Laboratory (M 20 /M 26 in Kent, M 6 J 4 a near Binningham and M 27 /M 3 near Southampton). Swooping is defined as vehicles cutting directly from lanes 2 or 3 or the maintine into the slip road in order to leave the mainline, typically within 500 m of the diverge point. In order to comb and confirm the objective data collected from the TRL video trial at the M 27 /M 3, a subsequent questionnaire survey was carried out between November 2000 and March 2001 on 54 drivers familiar with the Before and After layouts. Results showed a favourable response to the new layout in terms of drivers experiencing smoother flow, a reduction in last minute lane changes and easier access to the M 3. Recommendations were made with regards to incorporating these designs as standard diverge layouts as well as consulting drivers more extensively before any major new motorway junction schemes are implemented...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} research {{looking at}} the design and operation of motorway diverges using the microscopic computer program SISTM. A diverge is {{the area of the}} motorway or other major road where drivers can leave the main carriageway. Low cost measures including the installation of alternative designs (such as the <b>Ghost</b> <b>Island</b> diverge) are assessed which could improve the operation, capacity and driving behaviour at the diverge. Following on from a recent study reviewing the diverging flow-region diagram (used in the UK as a tool to help traffic engineers select the most suitable diverge layout for a particular site with given downstream mainline and diverging flows), it was thought that microscopic models could offer potential benefits in confirming such a choice (particularly in border line situations) as driving behaviour aspects which affect capacity are not catered for in the diagram. SISTM has been used to evaluate existing and alternative diverge layouts in terms of their throughput as well as several other parameters. Modelled and observed data for the speed-flow relationship and the lane distribution of the mainline was compared and differences noted in order that the results could be interpreted correctly. A theoretical comparison of four layouts was carried out; Taper, Parallel, Taper lane drop and <b>Ghost</b> <b>Island</b> diverge. The link between throughput and lane distribution on the mainline before the diverge was also assessed as well as the importance of lane and exit choice. This research presents a summary of some of the key results from the modelling along with a discussion of their accuracy and application. Conclusions and recommendations are made with regard to design implications for diverges along with a list of modelling requirements (essential and desirable) for motorway diverges...|$|E
