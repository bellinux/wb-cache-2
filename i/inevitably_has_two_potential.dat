30|$|This result <b>has</b> <b>two</b> <b>potential</b> implications.

Second, this movement also represents a self-tracking mechanism that keeps disadvantaged students in public schools and moves advantaged students to private schools. Although Brazil does not have a formal tracking system, sorting of this kind may explain why early disadvantages have persistent effects.|$|R
