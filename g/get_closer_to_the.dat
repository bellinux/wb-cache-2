5|$|Like {{many of his}} contemporaries, he {{does not}} seem to have felt that his admiration for the pre-Islamic Iranian civilization {{conflicted}} with his Muslim Shiite faith. According to some accounts, he repaired the Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala, and built a mausoleum of Ali in Najaf, which is today known as the Imam Ali Mosque. He is said to have been generous to a prominent Shiite theologian, but did not follow a Shiite religious policy and was tolerant to the Sunnis. He even tried to <b>get</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sunnis by giving his daughter in marriage to the caliph, which was a failure because the caliph refused to consummate the marriage.|$|E

5|$|Geen was {{selected}} to play for Oxford against Cambridge in four consecutive years from 1910 to 1913. In the first of these, on 13 December 1910, a 9,000-strong crowd turned up at Queen's, mostly to watch Ronnie Poulton, playing for Oxford. Cambridge started strong but a try by Bryn Lewis was disallowed in the opening minutes after a touch judge signalled that Geen had put his foot into touch in the preceding Oxford move. Moments later, Poulton ran through the Cambridge defence, drew the fullback and passed to Geen to dive in at the corner for a try. With Turner's conversion, Oxford led 5–0. A similar passage of play again saw Poulton put Geen through for a try, but he dropped the ball after crossing the line while trying to <b>get</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> posts.|$|E

The show featured new orchestral arrangements of The Decemberists' songs by Sean O'Loughlin, who also conducted in lieu of Kalmar. While the concert was free, the front seating sections were reserved for season membership holders; fans of the band got the remaining seats or sat on the lawn. This led Decemberists' frontman Colin Meloy to encourage the crowd to breach the barriers between the seats and Great Lawn to <b>get</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stage for the band's encore performance, which was without the orchestra. Estimated attendance was 11,000 to 15,000, the largest for any free concert at the pavilion to date.|$|E
5|$|Mount Adams is the second-most isolated, {{in terms}} of access, {{stratovolcano}} in Washington; Glacier Peak is the most isolated. Only two major highways pass close to it. Highway 12 passes about 25 {{miles to the north}} of Adams through the Cascades. Highway 141 comes within 13 miles of Adams as it follows the White Salmon River valley up from the Columbia River to the small town of Trout Lake. From either highway, travelers have to use Forest Service roads to <b>get</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mountain. The main access roads, FR 23, FR 82, FR 80, and FR 21, are paved for part of their length. Most all other roads are gravel or dirt, with varying degrees of maintenance. Access to the Mount Adams Recreation Area is by way of FR 82, which becomes BIA 285 at the Yakama reservation boundary. BIA 285 is known to be extremely rough and often suitable only for trucks or high-clearance vehicles. Two small towns, Glenwood and Trout Lake, are located in valleys less than 15 miles from the summit, Glenwood on the southeast quarter and Trout Lake on the southwest quarter.|$|E

500|$|A {{scholar of}} linguistics, Lowell {{was one of}} the founders of the American Dialect Society. He used this {{interest}} in his writing, particularly in The Biglow Papers, presenting a heavily ungrammatical phonetic spelling of the Yankee dialect, a method called eye dialect. In using this vernacular, Lowell intended to <b>get</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> common man's experience and was rebelling against more formal and, as he thought, unnatural representations of Americans in literature. As he wrote in his introduction to The Biglow Papers, [...] "few American writers or speakers wield their native language with the directness, precision, and force that are common as the day in the mother country". Though intentionally humorous, this accurate presentation of the dialect was pioneering work in American literature. [...] For example, Lowell's character Hosea Biglow says in verse: ...|$|E

500|$|The next day, September 5, {{the crew}} caught a brief glimpse of Wrangel's Land—or perhaps, as De Long surmised, a mirage. Ice {{conditions}} now {{made it impossible}} to move closer to this tantalizing shore, and De Long made Herald Island his new objective. Shortly afterwards, Jeannette was sealed within the pack, [...] "as tightly as a fly in amber" [...] according to historian Leonard Guttridge. Herald Island was still about [...] away; a sled party under Chipp set off across the ice, to [...] investigate the possibility of a winter harbor [...] should the ship regain maneuverability. Chipp's party was unable to <b>get</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island than , [...] before the volatile ice conditions forced their return to the ship. De Long still hoped for a change in the weather that would release them from the ice, writing in his journal: [...] "I am told that in the later part of September and early part of October there is experienced in these latitudes quite an Indian Summer". The following weeks brought no increase in temperature, and De Long reluctantly accepted that Jeannette was trapped for the winter.|$|E
500|$|Unlike Sesame Street, which {{tested a}} third of its episodes, the Blue's Clues {{research}} team field tested every episode three times with children aged between two to six in preschool environments such as Head Start programs, public schools, and private day care centers. There were three phases of testing: content evaluation, video evaluations, and content analysis. In their tests of the pilot, conducted throughout the New York City area with over 100 children aged from three to seven, the show was [...] "immediately successful." [...] They found that as the pilot progressed, children's attention was not only captured and sustained, but they became excited and actively participated with what they saw, {{to the point that they}} stood up to <b>get</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> television and spoke back to the host.

500|$|Batwoman {{appears in}} the [...] episode [...] "The Criss Cross Conspiracy!", voiced by Vanessa Marshall. Though {{visually}} based on the Kathy Kane's Batwoman, the character is never actually called Batwoman and is also an original character: Katrina Moldoff, the heiress to the Moldoff Circus fortune. On his Formspring page, Brave and the Bold director Ben Jones confirmed {{that the decision to}} rename the character was brought about after DC Comics voiced concerns about the episode's depiction of the character having a negative impact on the new Batwoman comic book series, the first issue of which launched {{less than a month after}} the episode's initial air date. She is portrayed as a thrill seeker and a trained circus acrobat whom Batman dislikes due to her crime fighting occasionally endangering innocent bystanders. When she is unmasked in public by the Riddler, she is forced to give up her crime-fighting life. She attempts to get revenge by encouraging Felix Faust to use a spell to switch her and Batman's bodies, allowing her to <b>get</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Riddler without the police coming after her. When she fails, Batman rescues her and gets Faust to switch them back. She goes along quietly with the police while they are arresting Riddler and his henchmen.|$|E

500|$|The new {{technology}} also allowed the developers to create both {{indoor and outdoor}} environments; {{one of the biggest}} complaints of Descent II was {{the fact that it was}} considered too [...] "tunnely". To this end, the developers created a {{new technology}} which featured an indoor portal rendering engine [...] "hooked to a flight-sim-like terrain" [...] engine, collectively called the Fusion Engine. The portal engine permitted designers to create small rooms with complex geometry. These rooms would later be linked together via shared dividing polygons called portals to create a portalized world for the player to fly through. In contrast, the terrain engine, which was initially planned for another game and whose function is to create more polygonal detail as players <b>get</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground and decrease polygons when they are farther away, gave designers the ability to create expansive outdoor terrains. Transitions between both engines were achieved using an external room (with its normal vectors inverted) that could be placed anywhere on the terrain map. With this technique, developers could create hybrid levels where the player could transit from indoor to outdoor areas in real-time and without loading screens. Leighton commented that whenever one of these transitions occurs, [...] "the game code [...] collision detection, rendering, and so on, to use the terrain engine".|$|E

He saw [...] "a period of intense combat in June 1945," [...] and was [...] "made an honorary member of VMTB-143 in August 1945."

While the medium bombers proved inaccurate, the Hawker Typhoon fighter-bombers proved more effective at attacking coastal defences. As the bombing runs continued to hit Juno, the destroyers and landing craft moved towards the beach and began close-range saturation bombardment. [...] In addition to the destroyers of Force J—two Canadian, eight British, one French—bombardment was also provided by converted LCTs fitted with [...] guns.
