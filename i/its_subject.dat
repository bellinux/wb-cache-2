Both Tyler and Ocean would often perform the song together during their various tours and was notably performed at the April 2011 Coachella Musical Festival.|$|E
5|$|Although The Wrestlers was {{probably}} exhibited {{as part of}} a major retrospective of Etty's work in 1849, it then went into a private collection and was not publicly exhibited again for almost a century. In 1947 it was put on sale; with little interest from commercial galleries owing to <b>its</b> <b>subject,</b> it was bought for the bargain price of 30guineas by the York Art Gallery, where it remains. The painting formed a part of major exhibitions in 2002 and 2011–12.|$|E

The album has since been cited as one of the original releases and catalysts of vaporwave, an Internet-based electronic music microgenre that covers much of the same sonic and conceptual territory.|$|E
5|$|Haley's {{contribution}} to the work is notable, and several scholars discuss {{how it should be}} characterized. In a view shared by Eakin, Stone and Dyson, psychobiographical writer Eugene Victor Wolfenstein writes that Haley performed the duties of a quasi-psychoanalytic Freudian psychiatrist and spiritual confessor. Gillespie suggests, and Wolfenstein agrees, that the act of self-narration was itself a transformative process that spurred significant introspection and personal change in the life of <b>its</b> <b>subject.</b>|$|E
5|$|Levin {{published}} {{his first book}} in 1970.

Among his topics were prominent people including Harold Macmillan and Harold Wilson – dubbed the Walrus and the Carpenter by Levin – and {{institutions such as the}} monarchy, the churches and the British Empire in its last days. Among the individual events examined in the book were the 1968 student riots and the prosecution for obscenity of the publishers of Lady Chatterley's Lover.|$|E

5|$|Religious {{views of}} {{conscience}} usually {{see it as}} linked to a morality inherent in all humans, to a beneficent universe and/or to divinity. The diverse ritualistic, mythical, doctrinal, legal, institutional and material features of religion may not necessarily cohere with experiential, emotive, spiritual or contemplative considerations about the origin and operation of conscience. Common secular or scientific views regard the capacity for conscience as probably genetically determined, with <b>its</b> <b>subject</b> probably learned or imprinted (like language) {{as part of a}} culture.|$|E
5|$|The Greek city-states of Athens and Eretria had {{supported}} the unsuccessful Ionian Revolt against the Persian Empire of Darius I in 499–494BC. The Persian Empire was still relatively young {{and prone to}} revolts by <b>its</b> <b>subject</b> peoples. Moreover, Darius was an usurper and had to spend considerable time putting down revolts against his rule. The Ionian Revolt threatened the integrity of his empire, and he thus vowed to punish those involved (especially those not already part of the empire). Darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece.|$|E
5|$|Tohari's second novel, Kubah {{was written}} in two months {{and based on the}} events {{surrounding}} the Communist Party and the 30September Movement coup in 1965. Published in 1980 by Pustaka Jaya, Kubah came at a time when literary works with similar themes– the victimisation of Communist Party members– were scarce. The novel has also been characterised as dawah (Islamic preaching). Reception of Kubah was mostly mixed; critics praised the novel for <b>its</b> <b>subject</b> matter and criticised it for its predictability. It received a literary award in 1981, and in 1986 it was translated into Japanese.|$|E

5|$|When it {{was shown}} at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition of 1825, it {{attracted}} near-universal praise from critics for its technical excellence, its fusion of the styles of different schools of painting, and <b>its</b> <b>subject</b> matter. Nevertheless, it failed to find a buyer at the Summer Exhibition, and was instead bought by fellow artist John Martin. The painting proved too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold {{it on to the}} Royal Scottish Academy. It was transferred in 1910 to the National Gallery of Scotland, where it remains.|$|E
5|$|Writer/artist Alison Bechdel's book Fun Home, {{a memoir}} in comics format, was {{published}} in 2006 to critical acclaim. <b>Its</b> <b>subject</b> is Alison Bechdel's coming of age, with particular emphasis on her relationship to her father, Bruce Bechdel. Alison's coming out as a lesbian {{is complicated by the}} revelation that Bruce was a closeted homosexual whose extra-marital affairs included underage men. Four months after Alison comes out to her parents, Bruce is killed by an oncoming truck; although the evidence is equivocal, Alison concludes that he committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Given <b>its</b> <b>subject</b> matter, {{the episode}} {{features}} many references to witchcraft and occultism. The nurse from the episode, Rebecca Waite, was originally {{named after a}} friend of the writers called Rebecca White. However, this was changed because there was a real nurse from Chicago whose last name was White. Some viewers ended up believing that Waite's name as a reference to either Rebecca Nurse, an innocent woman prosecuted during the Salem witch trials, or the Rider-Waite tarot deck, the most popular tarot deck utilized in the world. The episode itself directly references Gerald Gardner, a wiccan known for publishing several books on witchcraft and founder of the Gardnerian Tradition. While the Mayhew sisters tried to depict occultism without offending anybody by not connecting Franklin or Waite to any known cult, many Wiccans sent angry letters and e-mails to Fox regarding the portrayal of their beliefs.|$|E

5|$|One {{innovation}} of the Rokeby Venus, {{when compared}} to other large single nude paintings, {{lies in the fact that}} Velázquez depicts a back view of <b>its</b> <b>subject</b> who is turned away from the viewer. There were precedents for this in prints by Giulio Campagnola, Agostino Veneziano, Hans Sebald Beham and Theodor de Bry, as well as classical sculptures known to Velázquez, of which casts were made for Madrid. These were the Sleeping Ariadne now in the Pitti Palace, but then in Rome, of which Velázquez ordered a cast for the Royal collection in 1650–51, and the Borghese Hermaphroditus, a sleeping hermaphrodite (picture to the right above), now in the Louvre, of which a cast was sent to Madrid, and which also emphasises the curve from hip to waist. However, the combination of elements in Velázquez's composition was original.|$|E
5|$|The Decimal Classification {{introduced}} {{the concepts of}} relative location and relative index which allow new books {{to be added to}} a library in their appropriate location based on subject. Libraries previously had given books permanent shelf locations that were related to the order of acquisition rather than topic. The classification's notation makes use of three-digit Arabic numerals for main classes, with fractional decimals allowing expansion for further detail. Using Arabic numerals for symbols, it is flexible to the degree that numbers can be expanded in linear fashion to cover special aspects of general subjects. A library assigns a classification number that unambiguously locates a particular volume in a position relative to other books in the library, on the basis of <b>its</b> <b>subject.</b> The number makes it possible to find any book and to return it to its proper place on the library shelves. The classification system is used in 200,000 libraries in at least 135 countries.|$|E
5|$|The Greek city-states of Athens and Eretria had {{supported}} the unsuccessful Ionian Revolt against the Persian Empire of Darius I in 499-494 BC, {{led by the}} satrap of Miletus, Aristagoras. The Persian Empire was still relatively young, and prone to revolts amongst <b>its</b> <b>subject</b> peoples. Moreover, Darius was a usurper, and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.

Darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece. A preliminary expedition under Mardonius, in 492 BC, to secure the land approaches to Greece ended with the re-conquest of Thrace and forced Macedon to become a client kingdom of Persia.|$|E
