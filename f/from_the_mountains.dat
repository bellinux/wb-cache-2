5|$|In 1831, {{the first}} gold dollar was minted, at the private mint of Christopher Bechtler in North Carolina. Much {{of the gold}} then being {{produced}} in the United States came <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> of North Carolina and Georgia, and the dollars and other small gold coins issued by Bechtler circulated through that region, and were now and then seen further away. Additional one-dollar pieces were struck by August Bechtler, Christopher's son.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Manila, MacArthur {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Yamashita, who had retreated into the mountains of central and northern Luzon. Yamashita chose to fight a defensive campaign, being pushed back slowly by Krueger, and was still holding out at the time the war ended, much to MacArthur's intense annoyance as he had wished to liberate the entire Philippines before the war ended. On 2 September 1945, Yamashita (who had a hard time believing that the Emperor had ordered Japan to sign an armistice) came down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> to surrender with some 100,000 of his men.|$|E

5|$|In the {{ten years}} after the fall of Zaculeu various Spanish expeditions crossed into the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes and engaged in the gradual and complex conquest of the Chuj and Q'anjob'al. The Spanish were {{attracted}} to the region in the hope of extracting gold, silver and other riches <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> but their remoteness, the difficult terrain and relatively low population made their conquest and exploitation extremely difficult. The population of the Cuchumatanes is estimated to have been 260,000 before European contact. By the time the Spanish physically arrived in the region this had collapsed to 150,000 because {{of the effects of the}} Old World diseases that had run ahead of them.|$|E

As the song moves towards the bridge again, the scene changes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> to a cityscape. Madonna and her dancers are shown dancing and singing the song on a skyscraper. The video ends with Madonna standing on {{the building and the}} camera autofocusing out of the panel.|$|E
5|$|All known Daspletosaurus fossils {{have been}} found in {{formations}} dating to the middle to late Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, between 77 and 74 million years ago. Since the middle of the Cretaceous, North America had been divided in half by the Western Interior Seaway, with much of Montana and Alberta below the surface. However, the uplift of the Rocky Mountains in the Laramide Orogeny to the west, which began during the time of Daspletosaurus, forced the seaway to retreat eastwards and southwards. Rivers flowed down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> and drained into the seaway, carrying sediment along with them that formed the Two Medicine Formation, the Judith River Group, and other sedimentary formations in the region. About 73 million years ago, the seaway began to advance westwards and northwards again, and the entire region was covered by the Bearpaw Sea, represented throughout the western United States and Canada by the massive Bearpaw Shale.|$|E

5|$|As the Giro left Austria, {{the race}} began {{to enter the}} Dolomites during stage fourteen. The {{eventual}} stage winner Marco Pantani was in a chasing group on the final climb of the stage, the Passo di Monte Giovo. He attacked, bridged the gap to the leading group, and left them behind to claim his first professional victory of his career. The next stage saw Pantani win again after he rode away from the attack group on the last climb of the Valico di Santa Cristina and he then soloed to the finish in Stradella. Pantani's efforts on the day moved him up to second overall in the race. The race's sixteenth stage took a break <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> with the stage being primarily fled, which ultimately led to the sprint finish that was won by Italian Maximilian Sciandri. Ján Svorada won the next day's stage after attacking from the breakaway group in the closing seconds.|$|E
5|$|Davide Cassani won {{the fifteenth}} stage that {{featured}} a summit finish to Lumezzane, while the general classification remained largely unaltered. The next day of racing saw a break <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains,</b> with a primarily flat course that stretched from Varazze to Pontechianale. The stage ultimately {{finished with a}} bunch sprint that was won by Italian Fabio Baldato. The Giro's seventeenth stage concluded with a summit finish to Chianale. Marco Saligari won the stage by over a minute on the second-place finisher Gianluca Bortolami, while the general classification contenders finished together leaving the classification largely unchanged. Stage eighteen was a primarily flat stage that closed with a field sprint. Adriano Baffi won the field sprint and the stage, which was his third stage victory at the Giro that year.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 22 January, seven hundred RPF fighters moved down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> and waited in hidden {{locations}} around the city; they were assisted by RPF sympathisers residing in the area. On {{the morning of the}} 23rd they attacked. The Rwandan forces in the area were taken by surprise and were mostly unable to defend against the invasion, although the Rwandan police and army did succeed for a while in repelling the invasion in some areas, killing a number of rebel fighters in the process. It is likely the FAR forces were assisted by French troops, as the French government later rewarded around fifteen French paratroopers for having taken part in the rearguard. By noon, however, the defending forces were defeated, and the RPF held the whole of the city.|$|E

5|$|Earlier in {{the morning}} Dupont had {{proceeded}} with his column south and east along the river, from Marbach, according to instructions. Even {{before the arrival of}} Mortier's courier, he heard the sound of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause. They came back to report that a Russian column (Dokhturov's) was descending <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> to take the road to Dürenstein. Realizing this would separate him from the forward division, Dupont hustled his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the Russians in the flank. The French assault, heralded by cannon fire, caused Dokhturov's troops to turn their attention from Gazan's beleaguered force to face these new assailants. Although superior in numbers, Dokhturov's column had no supporting artillery, and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size. It was Dokhturov's turn to face attackers at his front and rear, until the arrival of Schmitt's column, which wended its way through the mountains in the west.|$|E
5|$|From its {{headwaters}} on Two Ocean Plateau in Yellowstone National Park, the Snake River flows {{north to}} south through the park, entering Jackson Lake near the boundary of Grand Teton National Park and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. The Snake River then flows through the spillways of the Jackson Lake Dam and from there southward through Jackson Hole, exiting the park {{just west of the}} Jackson Hole Airport. The largest lakes in the park all drain either directly or by tributary streams into the Snake River. Major tributaries which flow into the Snake River include Pacific Creek and Buffalo Fork near Moran and the Gros Ventre River at the southern border of the park. Through the comparatively level Jackson Hole valley, the Snake River descends an average of , while other streams descending <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> to the east and west have higher gradients due to increased slope. The Snake River creates braids and channels in sections where the gradients are lower and in steeper sections, erodes and undercuts the cobblestone terraces once deposited by glaciers.|$|E
5|$|Homer portrays Paul Bunyan, a great {{burden on}} the local townspeople, as he crushes their houses and greedily eats all their food. Eventually, the townspeople drug him and drag him out of their town. Out of loneliness, Bunyan carves a block of stone <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> into a blue ox that he calls Babe, who is {{rendered}} alive by an electric shock. In his travels with Babe, Homer creates several landmarks. Bunyan later meets a young woman, (played by Marge) and though she is initially frightened of him, the two fall in love. When a meteor is soon to hit the town, the townspeople call Paul back to help them. Paul obliges and throws the meteor towards Chicago, starting the Great Fire there, but not before it hits him in the backside.|$|E

5|$|Hotze was sorely missed. Despite mis-communication {{between and}} among the British, the Austrians and the Russians, the British miscalculation {{of the size of}} troops (consistently 10–25percent higher than they {{actually}} were), the lack of Swiss volunteers, and failed promises of transport mules, Suvorov organized his impressive march across the Alps from northern Italy, counting on Korsakov and his Austrian allies to hold Zürich. His soldiers took the pass at St. Gotthard in a bayonet charge, and endured incredible hardships navigating the narrow trails of the Alps. By the time the Russian army reached Schwyz, preparing to descend <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> into the Zürich plain, Masséna's army already had crushed the incompetent Korsakov's force at Zürich, and, in Hotze's absence, Jean-de-Dieu Soult's French division overwhelmed the Austrian flank at Schänis and crossed the Linth unhindered. When Suvorov cleared the mountains, he had nowhere to go; he was forced to withdraw in another arduous march into the Vorarlberg, where his starving and ragged army arrived in late October. Between Korsakov's inability to hold the French at Zürich, and Hotze's death at Schänis, the Swiss campaign degenerated to an utter shambles.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} keep up {{pressure}} on the whole front, the 19th Indian Brigade was ordered to attack Villa Grande and exploit any gains {{as far as the}} Arielli river which ran <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> through Tollo to the Adriatic. The attack went in at 05:30 on 22 December but failed in desperate fighting. The 1/5th Battalion, Essex Regiment renewed their attack the following morning with more success. After a counterattack by German paratroops had been repulsed at midday, the Essex advanced to mop up the remainder of the village. However, deadly small scale house-to-house battles continued throughout the rest of 23 December and for the next two days as the determined parachute soldiers clung on. To the south of Villa Grande, the 3rd/15th Punjabis had taken Vezzano on 23 December and a continuous brigade line had been established.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} what {{happened}} to the island's Christians after the Muslim conquest; the traditional view is that most were either converted or expelled. There is evidence from Muslim sources, however, for the continued survival of Christians on Crete, as a subject class, as in other Muslim conquests, although according to the same sources the Muslims, whether descendants of the Andalusians, more recent migrants, or converts (or any combination of these) formed the majority. There is also evidence of rival classes on the island as when Theodosius the Deacon reports that the rural Cretans, not rulers of the land but inhabitants of crags and caves, descended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> under their leader Karamountes during the siege of Chandax by Nikephoros Phokas to assist the besieged. It seems that the Byzantine Christian population of the countryside was left relatively alone, while the Muslim element (including native converts) predominated in the cities.|$|E
