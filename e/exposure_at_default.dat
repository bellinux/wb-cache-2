40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} dynamic model to {{estimate}} the credit loss distribution of the aggregate portfolio of loans granted in a banking system. We consider a sectoral approach distinguishing between corporates and households. The evolution of their default frequencies {{and the size of}} the loans portfolio are expressed as functions of macroeconomic conditions as well as unobservable credit risk factors, which capture contagion effects between sectors. In addition, we model the distributions of the <b>Exposures</b> <b>at</b> <b>Default</b> and the Losses Given Default. We apply our framework to the Spanish banking system, where we find that sectoral default frequencies are not only affected by economic cycles but also by a persistent latent factor. Finally, we identify the riskier sectors, perform stress tests and compare the relative risk of small and large institutions.

40|$|This Special Comment {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between bond prices <b>at</b> <b>default</b> and prices immediately prior to bankruptcy resolution for a sample of 303 non-financial US firms with an average time in bankruptcy of about twenty months. The key findings are: • The median nominal return on bonds from default to resolution is zero, but the mean return is substantial due to the skewness of return distribution. The median ratio of the emergence price to the default price is 1. 00, and the mean ratio is 1. 17. This means while the typical defaulted bond had the same price at emergences as <b>at</b> <b>default,</b> on average, bond prices at emergence were 17 % higher than <b>at</b> <b>default.</b> • The mean return on defaulted bonds earned by investors {{is similar to the}} average return earned by the Lehman single-B bond index, but the median return is substantially less. When the emergence price is discounted back to the <b>default</b> date <b>at</b> the contemporaneous rate of return earned by the index, the mean ratio of the discounted reso-lution price to the default price is 0. 97, and the median ratio is 0. 87, implying that, on average, defaulted bonds earn roughly the same return as the Single-B Index. • The mean ratio of the discounted emergence price to the default price does not appear to vary systematically across various subsets of the sample, including types of initial default events, levels of seniority, price ranges <b>at</b> <b>default,</b> lengths of time spent in bankruptcy, and different years of default...|$|R
40|$|Blistering of {{tungsten}} (W) surfaces due to deuterium (D) implantation was investigated by {{a sequence of}} <b>exposures</b> <b>at</b> two different temperatures‒ 230 and 450 K‒and by the reversed sequence. A single <b>exposure</b> <b>at</b> 230 K leads to a high areal density of small dome-shaped blisters (up to 3 m in diameter) together with much smaller flat-topped structures, while a single 450 -K exposure produces large dome-shaped blisters up to 40 m in diameter without the flat-topped structures. Most of the small dome-shaped blisters from 230 K exposure disappeared after annealing at 450 K for 17 h, but survived and even grew in size if the surface was exposed to D plasma during annealing. Sequential <b>exposure</b> <b>at</b> the two temperatures reveals a non-commutative behaviour: after a first <b>exposure</b> <b>at</b> 450 K the second <b>exposure</b> <b>at</b> 230 K leads to superposition of the observed blister structures without changing the large blisters from the first exposure. By contrast, a first <b>exposure</b> <b>at</b> 230 K almost completely suppresses the formation of large blisters during a second <b>exposure</b> <b>at</b> 450 K.

50|$|<b>Exposure</b> <b>at</b> <b>default</b> or (EAD) is a {{parameter}} used in {{the calculation}} of economic capital or regulatory capital under Basel II for a banking institution. It {{can be defined as}} the gross exposure under a facility upon default of an obligor.|$|E

50|$|Theoretically, LGD is {{calculated}} in different ways, {{but the most}} popular is 'Gross' LGD, where total losses are divided by <b>exposure</b> <b>at</b> <b>default</b> (EAD).

If collateral value is zero in the last case then Blanco LGD is equivalent to Gross LGD. Different types of statistical methods {{can be used to}} do this.|$|E

50|$|Banks can {{determine}} their own estimation for some components of risk measure: {{the probability of}} default (PD), <b>exposure</b> <b>at</b> <b>default</b> (EAD) and effective maturity (M). The goal is to define risk weights by determining the cut-off points between and within areas of the expected loss (EL) and the unexpected loss (UL), where the regulatory capital should be held, in the probability of default.

50|$|Under F-IRB, EAD is {{calculated}} taking {{account of the}} underlying asset, forward valuation, facility type and commitment details.

On-balance sheet netting of loans and deposits of a bank to a corporate counterparty is permitted to reduce the estimate of EAD under certain conditions. For off-balance sheet items, there are two broad types which the IRB approach needs to address: transactions with uncertain future drawdown, such as commitments and revolving credits, and OTC foreign exchange, interest rate and equity derivative contracts.|$|E
50|$|Banks can {{determine}} their own estimation for some components of risk measure: {{the probability of}} default (PD), loss given default (LGD), <b>exposure</b> <b>at</b> <b>default</b> (EAD) and effective maturity (M). For public companies, default probabilities are commonly estimated using either the structural model of credit risk proposed by Robert Merton (1974) or reduced form models like the Jarrow-Turnbull model.

The goal is to define risk weights by determining the cut-off points between and within areas of the expected loss (EL) and the unexpected loss (UL), where the regulatory capital should be held, in the probability of default.

We find that RFV in a parsimonious structural credit risk model has {{a profound impact on}} hedging interest rate risk as it strongly affects model sensitivities to interest rates. In particular, RFV explains and quantifies two important stylized facts: i) the low empirical duration of high-yield bonds and ii) the decreasing sensitivity of credit spreads to interest rates as credit quality declines.

40|$|With the {{worldwide}} financial market confUsion {{caused by the}} subprime mortgage problem {{and the increase in}} credit line contracts with relaxed covenants, there are cases where financial institutions are facing demands to provide additional credit to securitized vehicles with heightened liquidity and credit risks. These are typical examples demonstrating the importance of risk management considering variations in exposure. There are also calls for incorporation of future variations in exposure into the model for the Basel II advanced internal ratings-based approach. This paper adopts commitment lines as a credit provision with variable exposure and constructs a credit risk model whereby stochastic new borrowing demand is linked to changes in a firm's asset value. Through simulations, the paper then considers the interdependence among <b>exposure</b> <b>at</b> <b>default,</b> probability of default, loss given default, expected loss, and unexpected loss. The paper also prepares a simple model for the covenants, and verifies the influence of the rigidness of covenants on expected loss and other risk factors. : Commitment lines, Probability of default, Loss given default, <b>Exposure</b> <b>at</b> <b>default,</b> Expected loss, Unexpected loss...|$|E
