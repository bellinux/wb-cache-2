5|$|In some cases, it is {{difficult}} to tell whether a trait has been lost and then re-evolved convergently, or whether a gene <b>has</b> <b>simply</b> been switched off and then re-enabled later. Such a re-emerged trait is called an atavism. From a mathematical standpoint, an unused gene (selectively neutral) has a steadily decreasing probability of retaining potential functionality over time. The time scale of this process varies greatly in different phylogenies; in mammals and birds, there is a reasonable probability of remaining in the genome in a potentially functional state for around 6 million years.|$|E

25|$|The mind series {{reflect the}} teachings of early Dzogchen, which {{rejected}} all forms of practice, and asserted that striving for liberation would simply create more delusion. One <b>has</b> <b>simply</b> to recognize the nature of one's own mind, which is naturally empty (stong pa), luminous (od gsal ba), and pure. According to Germano, its characteristic language, which is marked by naturalism and negation, is already pronounced in some Indian tantras. Nevertheless, these texts are still inextricably bound up with tantric Mahayoga, with its visualisations of deities and mandals, and complex initiations.|$|E
25|$|Ehrlich {{has argued}} that {{humanity}} <b>has</b> <b>simply</b> deferred the disaster {{by the use of}} more intensive agricultural techniques, such as those introduced during the so-called Green Revolution. Ehrlich claims that increasing populations and affluence are increasingly stressing the global environment, due to such factors as loss of biodiversity, overfishing, global warming, urbanization, chemical pollution and competition for raw materials. He maintains that due to growing global incomes, reducing consumption and human population is critical to protecting the environment and maintaining living standards, and that current rates of growth are still too great for a sustainable future.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{believe that}} the Iranian Interest-Free banking law <b>has</b> <b>simply</b> created the context for legitimizing usury or riba. In reality all banks are {{charging}} their borrowers a fixed pre-set amount {{at a rate of}} interest that is approved by the Central Bank at least once a year. No goods or services are exchanged as part of these contracts and banks rarely assume any Commercial Risk. High value collateral items such as real estate, commercial paper, bank guarantees and machinery eliminate any risk of loss. In case of defaults or bankruptcies, the principal amount, the expected interest and the late fees are collected through possession and or sale of secured collaterals.|$|E

25|$|There is {{evidence}} that the FCC continues to be influenced by the corporate media lobby. The strong, direct relationships that have developed over the years between regulators and corporate media lobbyists, is essential to greater influence. It goes much deeper than the idea that the lobby <b>has</b> <b>simply</b> been around for a while. Members of the FCC have traditionally had strong connections to industry. As the job of an FCC commissioner or staffer is often highly technical, and specific knowledge of the dynamics of the telecommunications and media industries must be known, commissioners are often plucked out of high-paying jobs in the industry. History has shown, {{due to the fact that}} FCC Commissioners are appointed only to five-year terms, that there is a revolving door between the Commission and industry.|$|E

Sreedhar Pillai wrote for Sify: [...] " [...] nails the character to perfection"...He is one good reason to see the film."

Rediff wrote that [...] "Karthi <b>has</b> <b>simply</b> had a ball..." [...] and [...] "It's {{been a long time since}} you saw an actor who can be as convincing in sadness and rage, as in happiness." [...] Naan Mahaan Alla was dubbed into Telugu and released as Naa Peru Shiva in 2011; it was very successful and earned Karthi some Telugu film offers.|$|E

After Pearl wins a sparring match with Holo-Pearl, {{she begins to}} show Steven the basics of sword-fighting. However, Pearl's lessons bore Steven, making him clamor for Pearl to teach him the signature move from the Lonely Blade movie, much to Pearl's chagrin. While Pearl is distracted talking to Steven, Holo-Pearl impales Pearl's chest with her sword, which causes Pearl to lose her physical form, leaving nothing but her gemstone. Although Steven is distraught at first, Garnet and Amethyst assure him that Pearl <b>has</b> <b>simply</b> retreated into her gem and will return, projecting a new body, once she has healed.|$|E
500|$|... "Burn" [...] was lauded by {{contemporary}} music critics. Jem Aswad of Entertainment Weekly complimented Dupri and Cox for producing {{what he called}} the [...] "best song" [...] from the album, along with [...] "Confessions Part II", which they also produced. Aswad said the songs feature [...] "mellifluous melodies". Laura Sinagra of Rolling Stone found Usher's singing a [...] "sweet falsetto on the weepy breakup song [...] ", adding, it [...] "convincingly marries resolve and regret, {{but when it comes to}} rough stuff, there's still no 'u' in p-i-m-p." [...] Cibula called the song brilliant and considers its step one and step two technique a hit. Jon Caramanica of Blender complimented the song for being the only [...] "serviceable" [...] track among all ballad-influenced songs in the album which [...] "often drown in their own inanity." [...] Ande Kellman of Allmusic considered [...] "Burn" [...] as one of the Usher's best moments in the album, together with [...] "Caught Up", the final single from Confessions.

500|$|Hugh Sterbakov of GameSpot {{was more}} {{critical}}. He called it [...] "a clone of the original", and criticised {{the lack of}} split-screen multiplayer. Another critical reviewer was from Edge; he described the game as [...] "virtually indistinguishable" [...] from the first Ridge Racer, and commented that Ridge Racer Revolution does not fulfil the expectations evoked by the original. It was also stated that {{it is simply a}} [...] "jazzed-up" [...] Ridge Racer 2, and [...] the visuals were criticised as [...] "antiquated". Despite these criticisms, the handling was praised, and the gameplay was described as [...] "varied". A reviewer for Next Generation contended that the original Ridge Racer was rushed {{in order to make it}} out for the PlayStation launch, and that whereas rival Sega had done an exceptional job of fixing their own launch day rush job with Virtua Fighter Remix, [...] "Namco <b>has</b> <b>simply</b> released a disc with a new track, using the same flawed game engine". He particularly felt that the price was much too high for what was essentially an expansion pack, and concluded that anyone who bought the game would be [...] "a half-step away from being conned". Will Groves of the Official UK PlayStation Magazine described the game as [...] "a poor sequel", but liked the range of options provided. He described the game itself as [...] "great", but further criticised it for not being fun, as he thought the feel is aggressive.|$|E

500|$|Jon Pareles from The New York Times {{felt that}} Madonna {{tried to be}} honest with the concept of American Dream in the album, but ended up {{producing}} songs akin to the [...] "folkie psychobabble" [...] of songwriters like Jewel. James Hannaham from Spin compared the album's introspective themes to her previous albums Ray of Light and Music and also noted Madonna spends much of American Life bemoaning the emptiness of celebrity culture. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian responded well to parts of the record saying [...] "American Lifes best tracks make a mockery of virtually all other current pop music" [...] however his conclusive point in the review was that there was not enough of good songs. The Village Voices Jessica Winter called Madonna's voice [...] "redundant" [...] and commented that [...] "she ironizes 'the American dream' only to pitch woo at her English husband and articulate a vague yet fiery frustration with her outrageously privileged station in the world". Ed Howard from Stylus Magazine gave the album a negative review calling the album [...] "about Madonna" [...] instead of American culture explaining, [...] "it's Madonna who, surprisingly, <b>has</b> <b>simply</b> run out of things to say". BBC's Ian Young also gave a negative review, saying that [...] "the tunes are bland and weak, the lyrics are uninspired and self-absorbed and the semi-Ibiza backing music is bare and recycled—and we are convinced that she has lost it." ...|$|E
500|$|Constantine began co-hosting What Not to Wear with Trinny Woodall in 2001, which {{required}} using her fashion advice and expertise {{in order to}} reform participants' appearances and fashion style. Constantine and Woodall hosted What Not to Wear until 2005 and became renowned for their tactile behaviour with the participants, direct advice, and frequently referring to breasts as tits which {{has become something of}} a trademark. Never one to hold back, a notorious moment arose when Constantine spontaneously pulled a female candidate's underwear down during filming as her knicker line was visible. Critics of What Not to Wear argued that the duo were too patronising to their subjects, a claim which they strongly disagree with. Constantine insists that their subjects [...] "see we have a genuine love of women. We love women and they can see that. Women just know." [...] She also stated [...] "Ultimately, what we're doing is giving people confidence. We're probably the only people who have an opinion, who care how ordinary people dress. No one at Vogue magazine gives a shit. They work with the designers, it's more creative and artistic – they are creating something beautiful. But they don't care about how their readers end up looking – whereas we do!" [...] The show made Constantine and Woodall household names and they are now known together as Trinny and Susannah. One reporter <b>has</b> <b>simply</b> referred to Constantine as [...] "the one with 'big tits'." [...] Constantine and Woodall have even considered taking insurance out on their partnership should something unforeseen happen, although Constantine was against the move.|$|E
500|$|A direct sequel for {{the game}} was briefly planned by Core Design. Few details were made available, but it would {{continue}} Brad's fight against the witches but his sister Jenny was considered to play a much larger role. However, it was never released (in part because of Robert Toone's departure from the company), as the new game [...] "has grown up so much during the development that it <b>has</b> <b>simply</b> became a follow up." [...] Its working title has still remained [...] "Curse of Enchantia 2", but only [...] "for practical reasons". This spiritual successor game ultimately became known as Universe. Released in 1994, the game uses an upgraded game engine of Curse of Enchantia and a similar user interface. Responding {{to some of the}} criticism of directed at Curse of Enchantia, Core Design described Universe as being [...] "a lot" [...] more logical and less linear than their first adventure game. They also described the text-based system as an improvement over the use of only icons, its benefits including allowing conversations between characters. They also acknowledged that Curse of Enchantia has [...] "suffered considerably" [...] due to inclusion of action sequences, something that [...] "adventure gamers don't want in their games." [...] The game's plot premise has remained similar to that of Curse of Enchantia, featuring a young man (the protagonist's name was changed from Brad to Boris, but he also has a sister named Jenny) who is transported to another world which has to save from an evil overlord. But Universe is more serious in its tone, as the game's humor only serves as comic relief and [...] "it was never intended to be as silly as Enchantia." ...|$|E
