40|$|The idea of {{a common}} <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> {{heritage}} is frequently {{referred to in the}} political discourses and practices of the EU. The {{idea of a}} <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage elevates the ideas of ownership and inheritance beyond the local, regional, or national frameworks and transforms the heritage sites and objects into a ‘common good’ belonging to all Europeans and into a source of a common <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> identity. Scholars have debated the possibility of a common <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage, and in case such could exist, what it could be grounded upon. Critical scholars have asked what might be the trans-border European dimension of heritage that goes beyond the mere sum of national, regional, or local icons, or questioned the possibility of common European heritage practices {{due to the lack of}} a singular European people. Some scholars have, however, found a possible common ground for a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage for example in urbanity, European cities and their historical environment, and the styles and movements of art and architecture. Functions and uses of the idea of <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage and the contexts in which it becomes important and meaningful have changed over the course of time and are constantly transforming. The recent societal, political, and cultural changes in Europe have influenced the notions on heritage and made the concept of a common <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage more problematic. What is a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage and how has it been approached in recent scholarly discussions? How can a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage be made sense of in relation to the ideas of universalism, cosmopolitanism, particularism, transnationalism, translocalism, transculturalism, and pan-Europeanism? The paper aims to clarify the meanings of a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage and critically discuss the problematic related to its foundations...|$|R

40|$|The vague {{concept of}} a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> {{heritage}} is frequently referred to – but rarely explicitly defined – in scholarly discussion. The use of the concept in academia constructs a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage as a category in research and explicitly and implicitly produces its focuses and outlines. Thus, {{the use of the}} concept can be considered as scholarly engineering of a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage. To {{be able to have a}} scholarly discussion about a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage, the meanings and uses of the concept need to be clarified. This article examines the meanings and uses of the concept in recent scholarly articles published in various disciplines. In the study, the concept analysis by Walker and Avant is applied and expanded with a discourse theoretical aspect: different recurring characteristics brought to the fore in the use of the concept are perceived as varying discourses on a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage...|$|R

40|$|The EU has {{recently}} launched several initiatives that aim {{to foster the}} idea of a common <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage. The notion of a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage in EU policy discourse is extremely abstract, referring to various ideas and values detached from physical locations or places. Nevertheless the EU initiatives put the abstract policy discourse into practice and concretize its notions about a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage. A common strategy in this practice is ‘placing heritage’ – affixing {{the idea of a}} <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage to certain places in order to turn them into specific European heritage sites. The materialisation of a <b>European</b> <b>cultural</b> heritage and the production of physical European heritage sites are crucial elements in the policy through which the EU seeks to govern both the actors and the meanings of heritage. On the basis of a qualitative content analysis of diverse policy documents and informational and promotional material, this article presents five strategies of ‘placing heritage’ used in the EU initiatives. In addition, the article presents a theoretical model of circulation of the tangible and intangible dimensions of heritage in the EU heritage policy discourse and discusses the EU’s political intents included in the practices of ‘placing heritage’...|$|R
