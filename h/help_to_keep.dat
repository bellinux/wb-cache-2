5|$|Ecologically, {{woodpeckers}} <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> trees healthy {{by keeping}} them from suffering mass infestations. The family is {{noted for its}} ability to acquire wood-boring grubs from the trunks and branches, whether the timber is alive or dead. Having hammered a hole into the wood, the prey is extracted by use of a long, barbed tongue. Woodpeckers consume beetles that burrow into trees, removing as many as 85 percent of emerald ash borer larvae from individual ash trees.|$|E
5|$|If {{a seizure}} lasts longer than 5minutes {{or if there}} are more than two {{seizures}} in an hour without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This may require medical <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the airway open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this. At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred. If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol.|$|E
5|$|Most {{molluscs}} {{have only}} one pair of gills, or even only one gill. Generally, the gills are rather like feathers in shape, although some species have gills with filaments on only one side. They divide the mantle cavity so water enters near the bottom and exits near the top. Their filaments have three kinds of cilia, one of which drives the water current through the mantle cavity, while the other two <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the gills clean. If the osphradia detect noxious chemicals or possibly sediment entering the mantle cavity, the gills' cilia may stop beating until the unwelcome intrusions have ceased. Each gill has an incoming blood vessel connected to the hemocoel and an outgoing one to the heart.|$|E

5|$|Suggested {{conservation}} {{work for}} the future includes habitat restoration and predator population control. A healthy balance of mature and young forests still exists on {{the southern end of}} Amami, so that area should be protected. Restricting logging would also <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> more forest available for the rabbits to live in by leaving more forest standing, as well as disturbing the surrounding environment more. An end to the building of forest roads used for logging and travel would further protect the amami rabbit, as they cause population and habitat fragmentation, destroys their prime habitat and allows predators easier access to the middle of forests where a majority of the rabbit population exists. Controlling the populations of mongooses, feral dogs, and feral cats is another approach that could help bolster the rabbit population. Eradication of the mongooses and feral cats and dogs is needed, as well as better control of pets by local island residents.|$|E
5|$|The Well-Manicured Man prefers subtlety to brute force, {{and will}} attempt to {{manipulate}} those in his way before using physical violence. Although the Syndicate's goals are opposed to those of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the Well-Manicured Man will, at times, aid them with clues or information, believing that letting out {{a certain amount of}} information would <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the two close, and consequently allow for them to be controlled. The Well-Manicured Man openly despises The Smoking Man, seeing him as impulsive and unprofessional. The two maintain a bitter relationship within the Syndicate throughout the series. The Well-Manicured Man is instrumental in the Syndicate's secondary agenda, to develop a vaccination against the black oil used by the aliens as a means of mind control. To this end, he works with Russian double agent Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) to develop a vaccine, eventually testing it—successfully—on a Syndicate mole, Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden).|$|E

25|$|The {{coastal regions}} in the {{southern}} part of the island are influenced more by open ocean water and by frequent passage of cyclones, both of which <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the temperature there from being as low as in the north. As a result of these influences, the average temperature in these areas in January is considerably higher, between about −20°C and −4°C (−4°F and +25°F).|$|E
25|$|The nares of some {{birds are}} covered by an {{operculum}} (plural opercula), a membraneous, horny or cartilaginous flap. In diving birds, the operculum keeps {{water out of the}} nasal cavity; when the birds dive, the impact force of the water closes the operculum. Some species which feed on flowers have opercula to <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> pollen from clogging their nasal passages, while the opercula of the two species of Attagis seedsnipe <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> dust out. The nares of nestling tawny frogmouths are covered with large dome-shaped opercula, which help to reduce the rapid evaporation of water vapor, and may also help to increase condensation within the nostrils themselves—both critical functions, since the nestlings get fluids only from the food their parents bring them. These opercula shrink as the birds age, disappearing completely by the time they reach adulthood. In pigeons, the operculum has evolved into a soft swollen mass that sits {{at the base of the}} bill, above the nares; though it is sometimes referred to as the cere, this is a different structure. Tapaculos are the only birds able to move their opercula.|$|E
25|$|Although they {{frequently}} live in dryland forests, tapirs {{with access to}} rivers spend {{a good deal of}} time in and underwater, feeding on soft vegetation, taking refuge from predators, and cooling off during hot periods. Tapirs near a water source will swim, sink to the bottom, and walk along the riverbed to feed, and have been known to submerge themselves under water to allow small fish to pick parasites off their bulky bodies. Along with freshwater lounging, tapirs often wallow in mud pits, which also <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> them cool and free of insects.|$|E

25|$|Ceramics {{are very}} {{delicate}} {{in nature and}} damages can occur {{even when they are}} stored away. The most common way in which ceramics become damaged is when they are stacked one inside the other. Unless {{this is part of the}} original design, this will typically cause nicks, cracks, or breaks. Some ceramics, depending on their provenance, survive better in different temperature and humidity conditions. Pottery that has been buried, such as from an archaeological site, adheres better to storage at a constant low humidity. Low humidity will <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> any salts from efflorescing which can mar the surface as well as remove the surface glaze.|$|E
25|$|Conflict often {{develops}} between queens {{and workers}} of haplodiploid species because workers are more {{related to their}} sisters than their brothers or daughters. This results in them trying to push the sex ratio {{so that there are}} more females produced by the queen than males. At the same time, however, it is best for the queen to keep a 1:1 ratio of male and female offspring because she is equally related to both. D. media workers and queens have been observed policing worker laid eggs which helps to push the ratio more towards the females. This may <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> worker-queen conflict from getting worse since workers do not produce many offspring in the nest.|$|E
25|$|Some {{dry suits}} are {{provided}} with internally attached suspenders which when hooked over the shoulders, will hold the trouser section up when the top part of the suit {{has not yet been}} fully dressed into by the diver, this is also convenient if the suit is partly removed between dives for comfort. The suspenders also <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the trousers fully lifted if the torso of a membrane suit is a little long to provide enough space for the diver to bend the torso comfortably when in use. If the crotch hangs too low it encumbers the legs when finning, and increases the risk of the feet pulling out of the boots in an inversion.|$|E

Original interior features were restored, although changes were made to the destination boxes. While the tram was repainted into the Beamish crimson and cream livery as used on No. 10, the intention of the restoration was to retain its original Portuguese styling as much as possible. It entered museum service in May 1992. In 2012 it received an overhaul and was repainted into a South Shields Corporation Tramways blue and yellow livery. At the end of 2016 it received a tyre and motor overhaul to prepare it for the busy Christmas season.|$|E
25|$|In summer, {{the coastal}} regions of Greenland {{experience}} temperatures {{similar to the}} islands in the Canadian Archipelago, averaging just a few degrees above freezing in July, with slightly higher temperatures {{in the south and}} west than in the north and east. The interior ice sheet remains snow-covered throughout the summer, though significant portions do experience some snow melt (Serreze and Barry, 2005). This snow cover, combined with the ice sheet's elevation, <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> temperatures here lower, with July averages between −12°C and 0°C (10°F and 32°F). Along the coast, temperatures are kept from varying too much by the moderating influence of the nearby water or melting sea ice. In the interior, temperatures are kept from rising much above freezing because of the snow-covered surface but can drop to −30°C (−22°F) even in July. Temperatures above 20°C are rare but do sometimes occur in the far south and south-west coastal areas.|$|E
25|$|Societies {{have varied}} in their attitudes and {{cultural}} standards regarding public intoxication, historically {{based on the}} relationship between religion and drugs in general, and religion and alcohol in particular. In some instances, consumption of a mind-altering substance has formed the basis of religious or other socially approved ceremonies and festivals. In others, intoxication has been stigmatized as a sign of human weakness, of immorality, or as a sin. Secular approaches may also vary, having less inherent opposition to drugs but acknowledging that these may affect the inhibitions that <b>help</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> socialized individuals from breaking prevailing social taboos {{which may or may not}} have been expressly criminalized. The attitude of a legal system to intoxicating substances can affect the applicability of intoxication as a defense under its laws: a system strongly opposed to a substance may even view intoxication as an aggravating factor rather than a mitigating one.|$|E
