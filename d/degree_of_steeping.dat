40|$|Smoking is {{the leading}} cause of {{preventable}} death in the US. Higher <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> impulsivity are one personality factor that is frequently associated with smoking and delay discounting is one measure of impulsive behavior. The generality <b>of</b> higher <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> impulsivity, or <b>steeper</b> discounting, is less well known. This paper will address the generality <b>of</b> <b>steeper</b> discounting in smokers when compared to non-smokers. Two experiments will be discussed. The first experiment compares the rate of discounting across several commodities (money, alcohol, entertainment, and food) between smokers and non-smokers. Differences between groups will be discussed as well as correlations within groups. The second experiment compares delayed health outcomes in smokers and non-smokers to address methodological issues in prior studies and to try and determine what differences exist between the two groups. Implications and future directions will also be discussed...|$|R

The <b>steep</b> slope at the foot of Laxmi Ridge and its adjoining area, along with the slope gradient of the channel together control channel flow and the meandering in the vicinity of the ridge. The morphology of the channel banks is characterized by steep to gentle slopes, while the inner banks are frequently marked by the presence of one or several small terraces (Fig.  7 and “Appendix”).|$|R

50|$|In mathematics, {{the method}} <b>of</b> <b>steepest</b> descent or {{stationary}} phase method or saddle-point method {{is an extension}} of Laplace's method for approximating an integral, where one deforms a contour integral in the complex plane to pass near a stationary point (saddle point), in roughly the direction <b>of</b> <b>steepest</b> descent or stationary phase. The saddle-point approximation is used with integrals in the complex plane, whereas Laplace’s method is used with real integrals.|$|R
50|$|Steepest descent. Although a {{reduction}} in the sum of squares is guaranteed when the shift vector points in the direction <b>of</b> <b>steepest</b> descent, this method often performs poorly. When the parameter values are far from optimal the direction <b>of</b> the <b>steepest</b> descent vector, which is normal (perpendicular) to the contours of the objective function, {{is very different from the}} direction of the Gauss-Newton vector. This makes divergence much more likely, especially as the minimum along the direction <b>of</b> <b>steepest</b> descent may correspond to a small fraction of the length <b>of</b> the <b>steepest</b> descent vector. When the contours of the objective function are very eccentric, due to there being high correlation between parameters, the steepest descent iterations, with shift-cutting, follow a slow, zig-zag trajectory towards the minimum.|$|R

40|$|Detailed {{geologic}} mapping in the Buckskin, Rawhide, and Artillery Mountains {{in western}} Arizona identified numerous folds in Oligocene-Miocene strata above the Buckskin-Rawhide extensional detachment fault. The folds are above or {{adjacent to the}} Harcuvar metamorphic core complex, which was uplifted and exposed by top-northeast normal faulting and penetrative shearing at similar to 27 - 9 Ma. Strata deposited during extension were folded, and the folds are truncated by the detachment fault, demonstrating that folding occurred {{during the period of}} extensional faulting. Fold axes are approximately perpendicular to regional extension direction. In two of the four areas of folding described here, alluvial-fan deposits derived partially from lower plate mylonitic rocks are the stratigraphically highest folded strata. Folding could have occurred above low-angle normal faults with curved or ramp-flat geometries, but fold abundance, large size, high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> closure, and <b>steep</b> northeastward dips <b>of</b> the northeast limbs of anticlines lead us to consider the possibility that at least some folds reflect local shortening {{in the same direction as}} regional extension. Application of critical-taper theory to an extensional wedge with very low basal friction indicates that wedge shortening would be expected if the wedge developed a sufficient surface slope that was downhill away from the wedge tip. Such a slope could have developed late during extension either because core-complex uplift tilted the wedge away from the core complex or because alluvial fans shed off the core complex produced such a slope. In either case, wedge shortening would promote core-complex denudation...|$|R
