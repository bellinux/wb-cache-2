5|$|The {{aircraft}} made a stop-over at Namsos, where sixteen of {{the passengers}} disembarked. This {{reduced the number of}} passengers on board to thirty-three, but the passenger occupying the jump seat continued to sit there on the next leg. The captain was the flying pilot for the segment. The aircraft departed Namsos at 20:07 and contacted Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center (ATCC) at 20:13 to receive permission to ascend to <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> 90 (FL 90), which was received. During the flight, the passenger in the jump seat held a conversation with the captain and asked several questions regarding the operations. The first officer did not participate in this discussions, and it was he who conducted radio contact with air traffic control and the airline's operations' center.|$|E
5|$|By August18, the NHC {{noted that}} the {{hurricane}} was asymmetrical, having uneven distribution of the wind radii. Later that day, deep convection continued to form and an eye later appeared on satellite imagery. Early the next day, the eye became increasingly defined {{as the center of}} Bob passed roughly 35mi (55km) from the North Carolina coastline. By 0600UTC, Hurricane Hunters recorded <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> winds of 140mph (225km/h), corresponding to surface winds of 115mph (185km/h). At this time, the barometric pressure of the storm also decreased to 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg), the lowest pressure recorded during the storm. After attaining this intensity, the hurricane tracked quickly northeast at 25mph (35km/h), steered by the trough over the southeast United States, an upper-level cutoff low over the Great Lakes Region and the subtropical ridge over the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|By the {{afternoon}} of August1, a strong central dense overcast, an area of high, thick clouds, developed over the center of circulation, prompting the NHC to upgrade it to a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Throughout the next day, the system gradually developed an eye within the central dense overcast, leading to further strengthening. Operationally, Guillermo was thought to have briefly leveled out in intensity on August2; however, in post-storm analysis, the NHC discovered that a steady period of rapid intensification took place. Unlike most hurricanes in the eastern Pacific, Guillermo was investigated by Hurricane Hunters reconnaissance aircraft during its rapid intensification stage. The aircraft released several dropsondes into the storm to gather meteorological data. This mission {{marked the first time}} the Hurricane Hunters recorded high-resolution wind data from <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> to within several meters of the ocean surface inside the eyewall of a major hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Early on September1, Hurricane Luis {{strengthened}} into a Category3 hurricane with {{winds of}} 115mph (185km/h); upper-level outflow continued to improve throughout the day, allowing further intensification. Maintaining its structure, Luis further intensified to a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 135mph (215km/h). Subsequent to doing so, its intensity remained steady for 42hours while it tracked nearly due west. Early on September3, satellite intensity estimates {{indicated that the}} storm strengthened slightly, attaining its peak winds of 140mph (220km/h) at around 0600UTC. Continuing on a westward track, the forward motion of the hurricane decreased to 13mph (20km/h) later on September3. When Luis was about 690mi (1,110km) east of the Lesser Antilles, a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance flight into the storm confirmed satellite intensity estimates. <b>Flight</b> <b>level</b> winds around the eye of Luis were recorded at 165mph (270km/h), which corresponds to surface winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 944mbar (27.87inHg).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Bob {{originated}} from {{the remnants of}} a frontal trough to the southeast of Bermuda on August12. The system tracked towards the southwest and later west towards the Bahamas. By August15th, satellite analysis of the system found a weak low pressure area a couple hundred miles east of the Bahamas. Operationally, the system was not declared a tropical depression until 0600UTC on August16 after a reconnaissance mission into the storm found a closed circulation and <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> winds of 37mph (60km/h). After post-storm analysis, it was determined that the low had developed into a depression around 0000UTC. Several hours after being designated, the system began to develop convective banding features. Roughly 18hours after being declared a depression, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded it to a tropical storm, giving it the name Bob. At this time, Bob was situated roughly 140mi (225km) northeast of Nassau, Bahamas. The storm tracked slowly towards the northwest in response to the deep layer mean flow it was embedded within.|$|E

5|$|In situ measurements, in real-time, can {{be taken}} by sending {{specially}} equipped reconnaissance flights into the cyclone. In the Atlantic basin, these flights are regularly flown by United States government hurricane hunters. The aircraft used are WC-130 Hercules and WP-3D Orions, both four-engine turboprop cargo aircraft. These aircraft fly directly into the cyclone and take direct and remote-sensing measurements. The aircraft also launch GPS dropsondes inside the cyclone. These sondes measure temperature, humidity, pressure, and especially winds between <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> and the ocean's surface. A new era in hurricane observation began when a remotely piloted Aerosonde, a small drone aircraft, was flown through Tropical Storm Ophelia as it passed Virginia's Eastern Shore during the 2005 hurricane season. A similar mission was also completed successfully in the western Pacific Ocean. This demonstrated {{a new way to}} probe the storms at low altitudes that human pilots seldom dare.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{left the}} western coast of Africa on September 24 {{and crossed the}} Atlantic without any development. The wave began to develop on October 2 north of the Lesser Antilles when it encountered an upper level trough. It strengthened as it passed through the Bahamas and early on October 5 a vigorous tropical disturbance formed. As the system already had tropical-storm force winds, it was immediately named Tropical Storm Tammy. Upon being classified, the system was poorly organized, with deep convection only persisting to the northeast {{of the center of}} circulation. Tropical storm-force winds were presumed to be located underneath the convection as ship reports nearby the system only reported winds up to 35mph (55km/h). Tammy quickly tracked towards the northwest in a southerly flow between a mid to upper-level low over the Gulf of Mexico and a ridge located over the western Atlantic Ocean. Later that day, a reconnaissance flight into the storm recorded <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> winds of 61mph (98km/h), which corresponds to surface winds of 50mph (85km/h). However, small areas of 60mph (95km/h) to 65mph (100km/h) were reported by the crew members of the aircraft. At 6:30pm EST (2300UTC), the storm made landfall with winds of 50mph (85km/h) near Atlantic Beach, Florida. The tropical storm then moved inland over Georgia and into southeastern Alabama near Ozark, where it lost its circulation on October 6.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} tracked to {{the northwest}} through the Yucatán Channel into an area of increased wind shear, which left the center exposed and elongated. Despite its poor structure, the system maintained strong winds in its eastern semicircle. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alberto early on June 11 about 260miles (420km) southwest of the Dry Tortugas, based on Hurricane Hunters' reports of <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> winds of 50mph (80km/h) in a few convective bands. Upon becoming a tropical storm, the low-level circulation had become better defined, though forecasts predicted the wind shear would increase, preventing significant strengthening of the storm. One forecaster at the National Hurricane Center remarked the system resembled a subtropical cyclone. However, deep convection developed and built westward against the wind shear as the overall organization improved. At the same time Alberto turned northeastward {{under the influence of}} an approaching trough. On June 12, the circulation abruptly reformed under the area of deepest convection, which coincided with the storm's passage over the loop current; consequentially, Alberto quickly strengthened to reach peak winds of 70mph (115km/h) about 220miles (350km) west-northwest of Tampa, Florida.|$|E

5|$|Upon first forming, the {{tropical}} depression {{was located in}} an area of light to moderate westerly wind shear. With a ridge to the north and west of the depression, the system moved to the northwest under weak steering currents. The depression slowly strengthened and intensified into Tropical Storm Edouard on September 2 while located about 120miles (190km) east of Jacksonville, Florida. The storm remained disorganized with wind shear displacing most of the deep convection from the low-level circulation. Upon becoming a tropical storm, forecasters initially predicted Edouard to gradually turn to the northeast, and within three days be located a short distance off the coast of South Carolina with winds of 60mph (95km/h). However, forecasters admitted little confidence in the prediction, and later forecasts predicted the storm to execute a loop and track westward into northern Florida or southern Georgia. Shortly after {{the tropical}} cyclogenesis of Edouard, steering currents became weak, resulting in the storm to turn sharply eastward. Late on September 2 deep convection developed over the center, though the center quickly became exposed again. The environment appeared to become more hostile on September 2 and 3 with increasing shear and dry air overspreading the center. Despite the conditions, the storm maintained vigorous convection over the eastern portion of the circulation, and it quickly intensified on September 3 to reach peak winds of 55mph (90km/h). A Reconnaissance Aircraft flight into the system estimated surface winds of up to 60mph (95km/h) and reported <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> winds of 82mph (132km/h).|$|E

40|$|The aim of Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) is {{to enhance}} the {{capacity}} of the airspace while satisfying Air Traffic Control constraints and airlines requests to optimize their operating costs. This paper presents a design of a new route network that tries to optimize these criteria. The basic idea is to consider direct routes only and to vertically separate intersecting flows of aircrafts by allocating distinct <b>flight</b> <b>levels.</b> This problem is a graph coloring problem that we tackle using Constraint Programming and a greedy algorithm to find cliques of the constraint graph which are used to post global constraints. Through the search for optimal solutions minimizing the number of distinct <b>flight</b> <b>levels</b> allocated, symmetries among equivalent <b>flight</b> <b>levels</b> are dynamically broken, and the variable ordering is guided by the cliques found in the first static step. With an implementation using FaCiLe, our Functional Constraint Library, optimality is achieved for all flow sizes except the smallest one, while the corresponding number of <b>flight</b> <b>levels</b> could fit in the current airspace structure. However, many other constraints should be added to this very simplified model to obtain an operational route network, such that the conclusion is rather the validation of the concept of vertical separation of large flows. This graph coloring technique has also been tested on various benchmarks, featuring good results on real-life instances, which systematically appear to contain large cliques...|$|R

25|$|Under Roeder, Newcastle won the 2006 Intertoto Cup {{by virtue}} of being the furthest placed team to advance from the Intertoto Cup into the UEFA Cup. This made Roeder the first manager to win a trophy for Newcastle since 1969.

However, notably much of the fans' {{criticism}} was directed at the chairman, Freddy Shepherd, and not specifically at the manager himself.

25|$|At 10:12:03, JP550 {{called the}} Zagreb middle-sector {{controller}} to inform {{them that the}} aircraft was out of <b>flight</b> <b>level</b> 310. The last instructions given by Erjavec to JP550 were to call the upper-sector controller on 134.45MHz and to stop squawking the assigned squawk code.

The data tag for the DC-9 would now disappear from his screen and the aircraft would become merely a point among many others.
