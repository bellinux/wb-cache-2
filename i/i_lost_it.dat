After {{learning}} that Tracy has quit the show, Liz mocks Jack, in a deep voice, saying [...] "Be a manager. Control your people. Buy better clothes." [...] Jack explains his plans to her on how he will get Tracy to return, with Liz once again mocking Jack, this time in a deep raspy voice, [...] "Just get it done. Nope. <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>it.</b> That was Batman", a reference to actor Christian Bale's voice as the superhero in the Batman films.|$|E
500|$|Not 20 {{hours had}} passed since the Texas game before the Tigers faced the Texas A Aggies. The Tigers won 10–0. Guard Wild Bill Claiborne was blind in one eye, and used his {{discolored}} eye for purposes of intimidation saying: [...] "See this? <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>it</b> yesterday in Austin. This afternoon I'm getting a new one!" [...] Ormond Simkins first ran in a touchdown from the 1-yard-line {{near the end of}} the first half. Quarterback Warbler Wilson got the second touchdown with five seconds left in the game. Texas A's campus paper, the Battalion, reported :..."(the Sewanee Tigers) are unmistakably the champions of the South this year..." ...|$|E

[...] The goodbye scene between Don and Peggy was a difficult one to shoot. Moss said, [...] "That scene was a really, really tough scene to do. They didn't tell me {{they were going to do}} this, but they told Jon to hold my hand and not let it go. Then he did, and <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>it.</b> Every single one of those tears were absolutely real. She wants to stay with all of her heart. She does not want to leave, but she knows she has to." [...] Hamm said there was [...] "respect, understanding, and admiration between those two characters. This is the exact right time for her to leave." ...|$|E

2500|$|In September Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte {{returned}} to Paris and {{took part in}} the legislative elections. Though he stayed in London, was a Swiss citizen he did not campaign, he was overwhelmingly elected in five departments. On September he {{returned to}} Paris and took a residence on Place Vendôme. The first appearance of Louis-Napoleon at the Assembly, his Germanic accent and awkward speaking style, persuaded Thiers and other Deputies that he was minus habens; an imbecile. This was also the view of Ledru-Rollin and the socialist deputies. The new Assembly voted to hold elections for a new President of the Republic, the first in which all Frenchmen with residences could vote. Elections were set for 10 December 1848. Thiers considered running, but told Falloux, another Deputy: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>lost</b> <b>it</b> would be a grave setback for the ideas of order; [...] if I won, I would be obliged to embrace the ideas of the Republic, and, in truth, I [...] am too honest a lad to marry such a bad woman.". [...] Instead, he made the major mistake of his political career; he decided to support to Louis-Napoleon, certain that he could control him. He believed that Louis-Napoleon's term would be failure, which would open the way for Thiers to run in 1852. On the eve of the vote, Thiers hosted Louis-Napoleon at his home for dinner. In the December 1848 elections, the moderate republican Lamartine received just 18,000 votes; the socialist Ledru-Rollin received 371,000, and the conservative General Cavaignac received 1,448,000 votes. Louis-Napoleon received 5,345,000 votes, or three-quarters of the votes cast.|$|E
