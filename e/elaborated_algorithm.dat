40|$|Mixture - {{modeling}} of mass spectra is an approach with many potential applications including peak detection and quantification, smoothing, de-noising, feature extraction and spectral signal compression. However, existing algorithms {{do not allow}} for automated analyses of whole spectra. Therefore, despite highlighting potential advantages of mixture {{modeling of}} mass spectra of peptide/protein mixtures and some preliminary results presented in several papers, the mixture modeling approach was so far not developed to the stage enabling systematic comparisons with existing software packages for proteomic mass spectra analyses. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for Gaussian mixture modeling of proteomic mass spectra of different types (e. g., MALDI-ToF profiling, MALDI-IMS). The main idea is automated partitioning of protein mass spectral signal into fragments. The obtained fragments are separately decomposed into Gaussian mixture models. The parameters of the mixture models of fragments are then aggregated to form the mixture model of the whole spectrum. We compare the <b>elaborated</b> <b>algorithm</b> to existing algorithms for peak detection and we demonstrate improvements of peak detection efficiency obtained by using Gaussian mixture modeling.

The aim of this paper was to verify the <b>elaborated</b> <b>algorithm</b> for dose calculation during total skin {{electron irradiation}} with rotary-dual fields technique (TSEI-RD). Material and method: Authors modified the 2 -D algorithm published by Podgorsak taking account of dose distribution along the body midline and doses in the body on a larger depth than in the skin. Depth-dose function, beam profile were measured in TSEI-RD conditions (spoiler, source-skin distance SSD= 350 cm, field size: 36 × 36 cm at 100 cm). Cylindrical vax phantom was used to calculate and then to measure the doses in a depth of 0. 4 cm during exposure to the electron beam of 6 MeV (at the output of Clinac- 2300 CD accelerator). Phantom was rotating with the pre-calculated speed during constant exposure to two fields executed one by one in each fraction. Thermoluminescent detectors (TLD) were used for in-phantom dose measurements and Marcus ionization chamber was used for calibration of TLD. Dose homogeneity on the phantom surface was checked for three phantoms with different diameters of 20, 30 and 40 cm. Phantoms were irradiated at different rotating speeds. Initial results: Doses measured by TLD were on average by 4 % lower than doses pre-calculated using the modified algorithm. Mean doses normalized to those pre-calculated and their standard deviations (both in per cents) were respectively: 96. 1 % and 0. 4 % for phantom with diameter of 20; 96. 5 % and 0. 7 % for diameter of 30 cm and 96. 0 % and 0. 8 % for diameter of 40 cm.

40|$|Colour {{constancy}} is {{a central}} problem for any visual system performing a task which requires stable perception of the colour world. To solve the colour constancy problem we estimate the colour of the prevailing light and then, at the second stage, remove it. Two {{of the most commonly}} used simple techniques for estimating the colour of the light are the Grey-World and Max-RGB algorithms. In this paper we begin by observing that this two colour constancy computations will respectively return the right answer if the average scene colour is grey or the maximum is white (and conversely, the degree of failure is proportional to the extent that these assumptions hold). We go on to ask the following question: “ Would we perform better colour constancy by assuming the scene average is some shade of grey?”. We give a mathematical answer to this question. Firstly, we show that Max-RGB and Grey-World are two instantia-tions of Minkowski norm. Secondly, that for a large cali-brated dataset L 6 norm colour constancy works best over-all (we have improved the performance achieved by a sim-ple normalization based approach).

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{system for}} {{automatic}} distant {{measurement of the}} conditions on sea surface is proposed. The measured parameters are height and length of waves and their direction of motion. The system is placed on an air- or spacecraft board and consists of the optic image recording apparatus and of the programmed hardware, automatically performing the image processing in real-time scale.

40|$|Given {{a quantum}} Hamiltonian and its {{evolution}} time, the corresponding unitary evolution operator {{can be constructed}} in many different ways, corresponding to different trajectories between the desired end-points and different series expansions. A choice among these possibilities can then be made to obtain the best computational complexity and control over errors. It is shown how a construction based on Grover's algorithm scales linearly in time and logarithmically in the error bound, and is exponentially superior in error complexity to the scheme based on the straightforward application of the Lie-Trotter formula. The strategy is then extended first to simulation of any Hamiltonian that is a linear combination of two projection operators, and then to any local efficiently computable Hamiltonian. The key feature is to construct an evolution {{in terms of the}} largest possible steps instead of taking small time steps. Reflection operations and Chebyshev expansions are used to efficiently control the total error on the overall evolution, without worrying about discretisation errors for individual steps.
