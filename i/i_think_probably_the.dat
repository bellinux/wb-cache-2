6000|$|Neither Hogg nor Scott, I think, was crafty {{enough to}} imitate the prosaic drawl of the printed {{broadside}} ballad, or the feeble interpolations with which the [...] "gangrel scrape-gut," [...] or bankelsanger, supplied gaps in his memory. The modern complete ballad-faker WOULD introduce such abject verses, but Scott and Hogg desired to decorate, not to debase, ballads with which they intermeddled, and we track them by their modern romantic touch when they interpolate. I take it, for this reason, that Hogg did not write stanzas xv., xviii. It was hardly in nature for Hogg, if he knew Ville de Grace in Normandy (a thing not very probable), to invent [...] "Billop-Grace" [...] as a popular corruption of the name--and a popular corruption it is, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>Probably</b> <b>the</b> original maker of this stanza wrote, in line 4, [...] "alace," [...] an old spelling--not [...] "alas"--to rhyme with [...] "grace." ...|$|E

5000|$|In his Western media {{appearances}} Pozner was {{a charismatic}} and articulate apologist {{of some of}} the Soviet Union's most controversial foreign and domestic policy decisions. He would frequently draw parallels and point out similarities between Soviet and Western policies as well as candidly admitting the existence of certain problems in the USSR. However, while stopping short of unequivocal endorsement and support, he nevertheless rationalized, among others, the arrest and exiling of Andrei Sakharov, the invasion of Afghanistan and shooting down of KAL 007, in his 1990 autobiography Parting with Illusions. Later, he wrote that some of the positions he had taken were wrong and immoral. In a 2005 interview with NPR's On the Media, Pozner spoke openly about his role as a Soviet spokesman, stating bluntly, [...] "What I was doing was propaganda." [...] Comparing his former role to that of Karen Hughes, the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, he commented that, [...] "You know, as someone who's gone through this and someone who regrets having done what he's done, and who spent many, many years of his life, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> best years of my life, doing something that was wrong, I say it just isn't worth it".|$|E
5000|$|Murry: [...] Hello, My name is Harold Murry, I am {{a family}} law {{attorney}} in Alexandria, I am {{also on the}} Supreme Courts domestic violence along with Anne Styre, who {{is a friend of}} mine, who I believe is speaking in favor of the bill.My problem with this bill, is I think it started out as a really good idea, if you go look at the web site, you see that it started out as the Uniform International Child Abduction prevention act.Because that is a huge problem, I have had cases where the father of the kid for instance is an exchange student from Jordan or he is a merchant from Pakistan and the people split and {{he is not going to}} get custody, he takes the kids to that country, and all we can do is write a couple of letters to the consulate, the mom never sees them again, there is no way to get them back.and that is why there is so much in this about the Hague treaty on child abduction, whether or not somebody is from one of these countries where you can take kids and never get them back. At some point, I think in August 2004, somebody appended some additional language to this, to make this solve all problems, and they took the International, the word international out and they added this thing that if you are from another state or have strong cultural ties to another state, that you are suspect, just like somebody who is from another country and really has the ability to do this sort of thing.I tell my clients, there are always these threats that well, I am going to take the kid, no I am going to take the kid and you'll be darned if you see him again. I say, let him take the kid to Mississippi, we will have the kid back in two weeks and the judge will put him in jail. I'd love it. Don't worry about it.We have all the laws we need. We have the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Enforcement Act; We have the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act - which is the federal statute to prevent children from being snatched from State to State.They talk about strong cultural ties to another State should make you suspect. Well, I can't imagine them saying that somebody in Nebraska has cultural ties to Kansas that are suspect, they don't even have culture. I mean, its all the same, they are from the mid-west. (audience laughter) I mean, I think it is going to be used against Cajuns or something, I don't know. If you live in Houston and you have LSU season tickets you are suspect.This should be, we need to send a message back to the committee to fix this thing back the way it was, to strike out the provisions that are just pasted in there where it says things like from another country or state, that that should be taken out and it should be an International act.We need this protection, but this is going to be abused, I mean, lawyers love ex-parte custody orders. When I started practicing in '85 that was part of your stock in trade, if you could get your party ex-parte custody before the hearing came up a month later, your phone did not ring, the other attorney's phone would ring.We went to a lot of trouble, you guys passed Code of Civil Procedure Article 3945 a few years ago making it extremely difficult to come in and get temporary custody, you had to show immediate irreparable harm.And this has these factors like um, has previously abducted or attempted to abduct that could be taking the kid on a day when it wasn't your day. There is all sorts of things, Ms. Bowler is absolutely right, there is no number, what if you just meet two of them, I mean you don't have to meet them all, they terminate a lease, all of the things that happen when you are going through a divorce are present here.I think it had the potential to be a very great act, but it is now extremely flawed by adding the business about the state, being from another state will trigger these incredible sanctions against you. I don't know if it is appropriate to amend a Uniform Act it's been done before because I remember the UCCJA when it was first passed, there were a couple of states with asterisk's by their name because they had taken some provisions out of it. {Rep Walker sits down} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> best is to just not pass it, but if you do pass it you can.|$|E

For me, that really hit home <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>Probably</b> <b>the</b> semester before last (Spring 2013), I did a semester abroad in Australia. I took some classes that require huge papers – viral impact assessment, assessment, term paper, sustainable communities - 16 page papers. There’s no way I can do this without planning. Sometimes I would get an Ipod and just start writing, and it would come out but with things this big, you can’t do that... I was kind of forced {{to do it and}} I saw the benefit in that, so since then even if it was a 3 page paper it’s so easy – you get that outline out...|$|E

In response to a reporter's question about whether he and his team should be afraid to fly their charter plane to Clemson soon thereafter, Groh stated [...] "I'm not saying this to make light of it by any means, but I'm not planning on having Arabs in the traveling party, so therefore <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>probably</b> that <b>the</b> threat of our plane being hijacked is pretty remote".
