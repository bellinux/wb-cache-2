5000|$|Generally speaking, Raider <b>fighters</b> are {{inferior}} {{in weapons}} and capabilities to <b>fighters</b> from the Earth Alliance, Centauri Republic, Minbari Federation, and other alien races. Partly {{this is because}} they are an older design; they tend to be slower and less-maneuverable than <b>fighters</b> from more advanced races. In several episodes of Babylon 5, Earth Alliance Starfury <b>fighters</b> were able to destroy or disable large numbers of Raider <b>fighters</b> while losing few or no ships themselves. As a result of this weakness, Raider <b>Fighters</b> are primarily used by pirates, raiders, and other [...] "outlaw" [...] groups to attack and capture or destroy unarmed civilian merchant starships; they are rarely used in combat against other <b>fighters.</b> Raider <b>fighters</b> are also capable of atmospheric flight.|$|R

In The King of <b>Fighters</b> 2003, Yuri continues in the Art of Fighting Team, but only with Ryo and Robert as the tournament once again requires only 3 <b>fighters</b> per team. King replaces Robert in The King of <b>Fighters</b> XI as Robert was once again having problems with his company and Takuma was too weak to participate. However, Yuri, Takuma and Robert use this as a chance to intensify the relation between King and Ryo.

He was then assigned to Jagdgruppe Ost (<b>Fighter</b> Group East) on 6 January 1943 and then to Jagdgeschwader 54 (JG54—54th <b>Fighter</b> Wing) on the Eastern Front on 11 February 1943. Serving with 1./JG54 (1st Squadron of the 54th <b>Fighter</b> Wing), Leutnant (Second Lieutenant) Lang was 34 and considered exceptionally old for a novice <b>fighter</b> pilot. His first three aerial victories were claimed in March 1943, and within a month he was transferred to 5./JG54 (5th Squadron of the 54th <b>Fighter</b> Wing) of which he became Staffelkapitän (Squadron Leader) on 20 August 1943.|$|E
5|$|In December 1942, Loring was {{assigned}} to the 22nd <b>Fighter</b> Squadron, 36th <b>Fighter</b> Group, Ninth Air Force at Losey Army Airfield in Juana Díaz, Puerto Rico. The unit flew anti-submarine patrols as part of a force defending the Panama Canal and Caribbean Sea areas. During this time, Loring primarily flew P-39 Airacobra and P-40 Warhawk <b>fighter</b> and ground attack aircraft. After a stint of this duty, the 36th <b>Fighter</b> Group returned to the United States to Charleston Army Airfield in Charleston, South Carolina. There, Loring and the other pilots of the unit trained with the P-47 Thunderbolt aircraft. It briefly moved to Scribner, Nebraska as part of this flight training.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015 the Finnish MoD sent {{a letter}} to Great Britain, France, Sweden and the US informing them that the <b>fighter</b> project had been {{launched}} in the Defence Forces.

The JAS-39 is mentioned in the letter as a potential <b>fighter</b> for the program. The request for information concerning the HX <b>Fighter</b> Program was sent in April 2016. The five responses were received in November 2016. The official Request for Quotation will be sent to all five aircraft manufacturers that provided responses to the RFI, through their four governments, in the spring of 2018.

The acronym DIS comes from Dalnij Istrebitel Soprovozhdenya or long-range escort <b>fighter.</b> Similarly, the MiG-9 designation was intended for the production version of the MiG-3 with the ASh-82 radial engine.

5|$|In early April 1945, Lützow joined Galland's Jagdverband 44 (JV44—44th <b>Fighter</b> Detachment) at Munich-Riem.

50|$|By World War II, most <b>fighters</b> were {{all-metal}} monoplanes {{armed with}} batteries of machine guns or cannons {{and some were}} capable of speeds approaching 400 mph.
