2500|$|Kmart started {{remodeling}} {{stores to}} the [...] "Orange" [...] prototype in 2006. In 2006 The typical {{white and blue}} interior of the stores was changed to orange and brown, and shelf heights were lowered to create better sightlines. The remodeled stores contain an appliance department with Kenmore Appliances and most have <b>hardware</b> <b>departments</b> that sell Craftsman tools, which prior to the merger had been exclusive to Sears stores. Some auto centers left vacant by Penske after Kmart filed for bankruptcy have been converted to Sears Auto Centers. 280 stores as of 2009 have been remodeled to this new prototype.|$|R

50|$|While Schwabacher's Wharf {{survived the}} Great Seattle Fire, their retail store did not. Within 16 days, they had erected {{temporary}} one-story brick building at Front Street (now First Avenue) and Madison Street. In 1893, another fire burned out their <b>hardware</b> <b>department,</b> prompting new construction with the <b>hardware</b> <b>department</b> as the separate Schwabacher Hardware Company, headed by Sigmund Schwabacher, {{who for the}} rest of his life traveled frequently between San Francisco and Seattle. Upon Sigmund's death in 1900, he was succeeded at Schwabacher Hardware by his son Leopold (Leo) S. Schwabacher (December 26, 1871 - April 6, 1930). Three years later, Leo married Edna Blum of San Francisco; they settled in Seattle. Another fire hit the Schwabacher Hardware Company on February 11, 1905, leading to the construction of a new and even larger store at First Avenue South and South Jackson Street.|$|E

5000|$|Boulder's {{traditional}} Downtown area, {{including the}} Pearl Street Mall, {{is in the}} western part of present-day Boulder. During the 1950s and 1960s, the city grew to the east, since the west side is bounded by the foothills. Downtown is host to a variety of restaurants, bars, and boutique stores. However, it has few grocery, <b>hardware,</b> or <b>department</b> stores and is therefore more of a [...] "shopping destination" [...] than a neighborhood with stores supporting the local population.|$|R
50|$|In 1902 Boland's {{business}} had grown sufficiently to warrant major improvements to his existing premises {{and construction of}} a spacious single-storied concrete shop fronting Spence Street, the first large concrete building erected in Cairns. The construction of this store necessitated the partial demolition of the original wooden shop. The new building carried an ornate facade with pediment and parapet, and a bullnose verandah. The verandah had paired columns with decorative brackets, and a frieze of rectangular fretwork. When completed the upgrade permitted Boland {{to begin the process}} of transforming his business from a simple general store into a large emporium with separate grocery, haberdashery and <b>hardware</b> <b>departments.</b> Department stores represented a new approach to retailing and were becoming prominent in all of Queensland's main centres and represented a new approach to retailing. The traditional retail business that had dominated Queensland's 19th century retail landscape was centred on a relatively narrow range of products and activities, and in its design and layout gave little consideration to consumer psychology. The department store, however, offered an extensive range of goods and services and created for the consumer an encompassing retail environment that was enjoyable and encouraged shopping.|$|R

50|$|Gamages {{had many}} {{department}}s, {{much more than}} modern department stores. There was a substantial <b>hardware</b> <b>department</b> {{on the ground floor}} which included specialist motor parts and car seat cover sections.

The toy department was extensive and there were substantial fashion, furniture and carpeting departments and in latter years a small food supermarket.|$|E

5000|$|With Kingston being a major [...] "hub" [...] for two railroads {{business}} flourished {{throughout the}} area.

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple and {{cost-effective}} technique for modulation format identification (MFI) in next-generation heterogeneous fiber-optic networks using an artificial neural network (ANN) trained with the features extracted from the asynchronous amplitude histograms (AAHs).

The proposed technique employs extremely simple hardware and digital signal processing (DSP) to enable MFI and can also be applied for the identification of other modulation formats at different data rates without necessitating <b>hardware</b> changes. <b>Department</b> of Electronic and Information EngineeringAuthor name used in this publication: Faisal Nadeem Kha...|$|R

50|$|The company {{continues}} {{to develop and}} release new software. The <b>hardware</b> <b>department</b> now focusses more on Audio Acquisition and Format Converters (such as their iBox range). As of 2010, the Soundscape 32 system and iBox range was still available. One problem is that IDE disk drives have largely been replaced by SATA and the Soundscape 32 units cannot support them. The current focus is to utilise hard disks connected to the PC together with a Mixpander card, providing {{a way that the}} software can operate without relying on the external units. The latest range has focussed on MADI connections, but this is a relatively niche area.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} has {{functioned as a}} hardware store since the early 1940s. When Barnes & Co. liquidated , their hardware business was purchased {{by members of the}} Connolly family of Warwick in partnership with Charles McKenzie, formerly the manager of Barnes' <b>hardware</b> <b>department,</b> and they formed The Warwick Hardware Company. This firm shifted to the Hyslop's stone building , and purchased the property in 1949. The store remained The Warwick Hardware Company premises until 1970, when Dave Washbourne and Alexander McKenzie started trading there as M & W Hardware (a Mitre 10 franchise), purchasing the property in 1976. In the 1980s the property changed hands a number of times, but the hardware business has been sustained.|$|E

5000|$|Cultural and {{technical}} changes, and competing interests (television, the space race, slot cars, etc.), soon relegated indoor larger-than-HO trains to an out-of-date perception. Additionally, the increased prevalence of discount stores ravaged the toy train companies' traditional distribution network (i.e. mom-and-pop hobby shops, and <b>hardware</b> and <b>department</b> stores). The discount stores demanded train sets at wholesale prices {{so low that}} the profit margins of the traditional manufacturers became unsustainable. Additionally, they did not offer the personal attention and repair services of traditional hobby shops. By trying to accommodate {{the demands of the}} retail discounters, Gilbert and other toy train manufacturers cheapened their lines. Their [...] "Pikemaster" [...] line exemplified the corruption of the products. This accelerated their downward economic spiral. Longtime train collectors and hobbyists were offended at this newer production, dismissing the new products as [...] "cheap junk", an accurate description.|$|R
