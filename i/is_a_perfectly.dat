500|$|The mirror <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfectly</b> defined {{unbroken}} pale rectangle {{within a}} broad black rectangle. A clear geometric shape, like a lit face, draws {{the attention of}} the viewer more than a broken geometric shape such as the door, or a shadowed or oblique face such as that of the dwarf in the foreground or that of the man in the background. The viewer cannot distinguish the features of the king and queen, but in the opalescent sheen of the mirror's surface, the glowing ovals are plainly turned directly to the viewer. Jonathan Miller points out that apart from [...] "adding suggestive gleams at the bevelled edges, the most important way the mirror betrays its identity is by disclosing imagery whose brightness is so inconsistent with the dimness of the surrounding wall that it can only have been borrowed, by reflection, from the strongly illuminated figures of the King and Queen".|$|E
500|$|Although pure silica <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfectly</b> viable {{glass and}} glass fiber, {{it must be}} worked with at very high temperatures, which is a {{drawback}} unless its specific chemical properties are needed. It is usual to introduce impurities into the glass {{in the form of}} other materials to lower its working temperature. These materials also impart various other properties to the glass that may be beneficial in different applications. The first type of glass used for fiber was soda lime glass or A-glass ("A" [...] for the alkali it contains). It is not very resistant to alkali. A newer, alkali-free (<2%) type, E-glass, is an alumino-borosilicate glass. C-glass was developed to resist attack from chemicals, mostly acids that destroy E-glass. T-glass is a North American variant of C-glass. AR-glass is alkali-resistant glass. Most glass fibers have limited solubility in water but are very dependent on pH. Chloride ions will also attack and dissolve E-glass surfaces.|$|E

500|$|In late 2009, McAdams {{starred in}} the mystery/action-adventure film Sherlock Holmes with Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law. She played Irene Adler, an {{antagonist}} and love interest of Downey's title character Sherlock Holmes, and welcomed {{the opportunity to play}} a character who is [...] "her own boss and a real free spirit". Todd McCarthy of Variety felt her character was [...] "not very well integrated into the rest of the story, a shortcoming the normally resourceful McAdams is unable to do much about". A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated, [...] "Ms.McAdams <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfectly</b> charming actress and performs gamely as the third wheel of this action-bromance tricycle. But Irene feels in this movie more like a somewhat cynical commercial contrivance. She offers a little something for the ladies and also something for the lads, who, much as they may dig fights and explosions and guns and chases, also like girls." [...] The film was a major commercial success, earning over $524 million at the worldwide box office.|$|E
500|$|Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone {{wrote that}} the album [...] "offers up another batch of great, club-ready songs that are a touch too weird for American hit radio. Robyn sings and raps about {{standard}} diva themes (dance-floor ecstasy, self-reliance), but the music is deliciously wacked-out." [...] Pitchfork's Joe Colly felt the album needed a [...] "classic single on par with 'Dancing on My Own' or ' Heartbeat'", but concluded, [...] "Minor quibbles and missteps aside, Body Talk Pt. 2 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfectly</b> solid—and occasionally awesome—record." [...] Heather Phares of Allmusic wrote that through the album, Robyn proves [...] "that stylish, cutting-edge pop doesn't have to be competitive or egotistical." [...] Adam Johns of Drowned in Sound was mixed in his review, writing that [...] "While it's a fairly remarkable piece of craft, her icy disco diversion here leaves me somewhat flat [...] It should satisfy the listeners who primarily show up for Creative Robyn." [...] Luke Winkie of musicOMH wrote a mixed review as well, saying that [...] "Pt 2 doesn't have the same feel it's as if Robyn may have exhausted her supply of great songs too soon. It has its moments, but in general just doesn't compare to Pt 1." ...|$|E
500|$|Up All Night {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, which indicates [...] "generally favourable reviews". AllMusic's Matthew Chisling commended the album for its {{appeal to the}} teenage audience, [...] "limitless potential for the time being, this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfectly</b> sized, and targeted, collection." [...] PopMatters Zachary Houle called the album a [...] "laudable addition to the boy band pantheon" [...] and a [...] "well-crafted slice of pop you can pop bubbles to". Digital Spy's Robert Copsey commended the album for [...] "a collection of pg pop rock with killer choruses" [...] and summarised it as [...] "an adorable as expected debut with a surprising amount of bite". Cosmopolitans Sophie Goddard lauded the album for a collection of [...] "toe-tappers that are just impossible to dislike". The Independent editor Simon Price gave the album two out of five stars, and in an assessment wrote: [...] "the album consists of fifteen instalments of inoffensive daytime radio pop, of which half the songs sound like [...] "I Want It That Way" [...] by the Backstreet Boys, the other half like [...] "Free Fallin'" [...] by Tom Petty, it will sell by the zillion." [...] Daily Stars John Earls complimented the group for creating an album [...] "that doesn't take the easy route", quipping that the album has [...] "big personalities" [...] and [...] "belting fun pop anthems", whilst Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone criticised the album for lacking personality. Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly perceived that the album [...] "won't help the group earn much respect in music circles. But if a tween-pop empire is what these boys are after, they're definitely {{headed in the right}} direction".|$|E
