5|$|Marion Little {{examines}} theoretical frameworks {{related to}} NVC. The influential interest-based model <b>for</b> <b>conflict</b> resolution, negotiation, and mediation developed by Fisher, Ury, and Patton at the Harvard Negotiation Project in the 1980s {{appears to have}} some conceptual overlap with NVC, although neither model references the other. Little suggests The Gordon Model for Effective Relationships (1970) as a likely precursor to both NVC and interest-based negotiation, based on conceptual similarities, if not any direct evidence of a connection. Like Rosenberg, Gordon had worked with Carl Rogers, so the models' similarities may reflect common influences.|$|E
5|$|Murdoch's {{previous}} {{foray into}} the sport was advising Amstrad chairman Alan Sugar to support Terry Venables's takeover bid for Tottenham Hotspur. The club, {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy, courted newspaper owner Robert Maxwell, someone whom Murdoch regarded as a threat. Murdoch chose not to make a bid for Tottenham himself, <b>for</b> <b>conflict</b> of interest reasons, and used his newspapers to create momentum in favour of Sugar.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} <b>for</b> <b>conflict</b> {{between the}} Ottomans and Venice was still present, as evidenced in 1638, when a Venetian fleet attacked and destroyed {{a fleet of}} Barbary pirates that had sought protection in the Ottoman port of Valona, bombarding {{the city in the}} process. Sultan Murad IV was enraged: he threatened to execute all Venetians in the Empire, and put an embargo on Venetian trade. Eventually, and given that the Ottomans were still engaged in a war with the Persians, the situation was defused with the Republic paying the Ottomans an indemnity of 250,000 sequins.|$|E

5|$|With {{their victory}} in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, the Japanese became {{concerned}} about the potential <b>for</b> <b>conflict</b> with the US. The theorist Satō Tetsutarō developed the doctrine that Japan should have a battlefleet at least 70% the size of that of the US. This would enable the Japanese navy to win two decisive battles, the first early in a war against the US Pacific Fleet, and the second against the US Atlantic Fleet which would inevitably be dispatched as reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Ottoman {{advances}} {{into the}} Balkans were aided by further Byzantine civil conflict — this time between John V Palaeologus and {{his eldest son}} Andronicus IV. With Ottoman aid from Murad I, John V was able to blind Andronikus IV and his son John VII Palaeologus in September 1373. Andronicus escaped with his son and secured Murad's aid by promising a higher tribute than John V's. The civil strife continued as late as September 1390 though potential <b>for</b> <b>conflict</b> continued until 1408. John V eventually forgave Andronicus IV and his son in 1381, angering his second son and heir apparent, Manuel II Palaeologus. He seized Thessalonika, alarming the Ottoman Sultan in liberating parts of Greece from Ottoman rule.|$|E
5|$|Since the Spanish Armament of 1790, the Royal Navy {{had been}} at sea {{in a state of}} {{readiness}} for over three years. The Navy's dockyards under First Lord of the Admiralty Charles Middleton were all fully fitted and prepared <b>for</b> <b>conflict.</b> This was quite unlike the disasters of the American Revolutionary War ten years earlier, when an ill-prepared Royal Navy had taken too long to reach full effectiveness and was consequently unable to support the North American campaign—which ended in defeat at the Battle of Yorktown due to lack of supplies. With British dockyards now readily turning out cannon, shot, sails, provisions and other essential equipment, the only remaining problem was that of manning the several hundred ships on the Navy list.|$|E

5|$|The Siege of Pondicherry was {{a colonial}} {{military}} {{operation in the}} early stages of the French Revolutionary Wars. Britain and France both controlled colonies on the Indian Subcontinent and when the French National Convention declared war on Britain on 1 February 1793, both sides were prepared <b>for</b> <b>conflict</b> in India. British India was centred on the principal ports of Bombay, Madras and Calcutta, administered by the East India Company. French India was governed from Pondicherry (modern Puducherry) on the Coromandel Coast. British forces in India were considerably stronger than the French, with the British Indian Army supported by British Army detachments and a Royal Navy squadron under Rear-Admiral William Cornwallis. Pondicherry's defenses were strong, but the garrison was too small to effectively man the walls, and although a French frigate squadron was stationed at the distant Île de France, it was unable to effectively protect the French Indian coast.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss Confederation in Huldrych Zwingli's time {{consisted}} of thirteen states (cantons) {{as well as}} affiliated areas and common lordships. Unlike the modern state of Switzerland, which operates under a federal government, each of the thirteen cantons was nearly independent, conducting its own domestic and foreign affairs. Each canton formed its own alliances within and without the Confederation. This relative independence served as the basis <b>for</b> <b>conflict</b> {{during the time of}} the Reformation when the various cantons divided between different confessional camps. Military ambitions gained an additional impetus with the competition to acquire new territory and resources, as seen for example in the Old Zurich War of 1440–1446.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{establish}} an administration was initiated by Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld in 1871. After contacting the invested governments, {{he concluded that}} only Russia and Norway would object to an annexation of the island. Fridtjof Nansen's endeavors raised the Norwegian public's consciousness of the Arctic, which again brought forth public support for annexation of Svalbard. Industrialization and permanent settlements on Svalbard began in the 1900s {{with the introduction of}} coal mining. This resulted in the need for jurisdiction. Firstly, there was no means to make a mining claim legal. Secondly, there was a need <b>for</b> <b>conflict</b> resolution, particularly regarding labor conflicts, which often saw the mining company and the workers have different nationalities.|$|E

5|$|As Brundage {{approached}} {{the end of}} his track career, he began to involve himself in sports administration, at first through the CAA, then through the Central Association of the Amateur Athletic Union (of which the CAA was a member) and then, beginning in 1919, in the AAU. That group was involved in an ongoing battle for dominance over US amateur sports with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Athletes were often used as pawns in the battle, with one organization threatening to suspend those who participated in events sponsored by the other. Another venue <b>for</b> <b>conflict</b> was in the United States' National Olympic Committee (NOC), which was then called the American Olympic Committee (AOC), and which was AAU-dominated. In 1920, there was public outcry when the AOC chartered a disused troopship to carry home America's representatives in the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp; much of the team instead booked passage by ocean liner. In response, the AAU founded an American Olympic Association as a separate group, although it was still initially dominated by AAU representatives—it then selected the AOC. In 1928, on the resignation of then-AOA president General Douglas MacArthur, Brundage was elected president of the AOA; he was also elected president of the AOC, a post he held for over 20 years.|$|E
5|$|The overall British {{operation}} was mostly completed by September 2000. The RUF began to disarm after political pressure, and later economic sanctions, were exerted on Liberia—which had supported the RUF in exchange <b>for</b> <b>conflict</b> diamonds smuggled out of Sierra Leone. The Sierra Leonean government eventually signed a ceasefire with the RUF that obliged {{the latter to}} enter the Disarmament, Demobilisation, and Reintegration (DDR) process. By September 2001, when the British training teams were replaced by an international force, the DDR process was almost complete. British forces continued {{to be involved in}} Sierra Leone by providing the largest contribution of personnel to the international training team and advising on a restructuring of Sierra Leone's armed forces. A small force was deployed to the area in 2003 to ensure stability while several indictments and arrests were made by the Special Court for Sierra Leone. The success of British operations in Sierra Leone vindicated several concepts, including the retention of high-readiness forces. The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, was keen to see Western interventions in other conflicts, and—along with France—supported the creation of several European Union Battlegroups for the purpose. As it happened, political opposition and later British commitments in Afghanistan and Iraq prevented further British operations in Africa.|$|E
