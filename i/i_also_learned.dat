One more passage of his I must refer you to, as illustrative of the point before us; the description of the temple of the Syrian Hieropolis, where he explains the absence of the images of the sun and moon. [...] "In the temple itself," [...] he says, [...] "on the left hand as one goes in, there is set first the throne of the sun; but no form of him is thereon, for of these two powers alone, the sun and the moon, they show no carved images. And <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>learned</b> why this is their law, for they say that it is permissible, indeed, to make of the other gods, graven images, since the forms of them are not visible to all men. But Helios and Selenaia are everywhere clear-bright, and all men behold them; what need is there therefore for sculptured work of these, who appear in the air?" ...|$|E

All of us here belong to three ships, except those taken with you; but from the talk of the sailors, I heard that they had already sent off two batches of captives, by another ship which was {{cruising}} in company of them. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>learned</b> that the quarrel, which took place just after you were captured, arose {{from the fact that the}} captain wished a party to land, to carry off two women from somewhere in the island of Corfu; but the crew insisted on first returning with the booty, urging, that if surprised by a Venetian galley, they might lose all the result of their toil. This was the opinion of the majority, although a few sided with the captain, being induced to do so by the fact that he offered to give up all his share of the booty, if they would do so.|$|E

One of them sank before she was out of sight, and I soon heard that your ship had sunk another, and that two had got away.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} a question how the icreasing of the excise tax in the Czech Republic in the year 2010 influenced the state budget.
