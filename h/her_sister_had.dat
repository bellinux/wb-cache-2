5|$|On 9 January 1914, Seeadler {{departed}} East Africa for {{the last}} time, bound for Germany. She had spent nearly thirteen {{and a half years}} abroad, the longest uninterrupted period of overseas service of any major German warship. Her replacement, <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> , <b>had</b> not yet arrived but was en route. Seeadler stopped in Aden on 22 January, and arrived in Kiel on 18 March. She was then moved to Danzig and decommissioned. On 6 May 1914, she was reclassified as a gunboat. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she was reduced to a hulk for storing naval mines since she was no longer fit for active service. She was towed to Wilhelmshaven and anchored in the outer roadstead. On 19 April 1917, her cargo exploded while she was moored in the Jade outside Wilhelmshaven. The explosion destroyed the ship, but there were no casualties; her wreck was never raised.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, Margaret and {{her sister}} Mary were sent to Britain, there moving in with their uncle John, a vicar, and his wife Harriet at their home in Lambourn, Berkshire. Although John {{provided}} them with a strongly Christian education and {{a belief in the}} inferiority of women, both of which she would reject, he awakened Murray's interest in archaeology through taking her to see local monuments. In 1873, the girls' mother arrived in Europe and took them with her to Bonn in Germany, where they both became fluent in German. In 1875 they returned to Calcutta, staying there till 1877. They then moved with their parents back to England, where they settled in Sydenham, South London. There, they spent much time visiting The Crystal Palace, while their father worked at his firm's London office. In 1880, they returned to Calcutta, where Margaret remained for the next seven years. She became a nurse at the Calcutta General Hospital, which was run by the Sisters of the Anglican Sisterhood of Clower, and there was involved with the hospital's attempts to deal with a cholera outbreak. In 1887, she returned to England, moving to Rugby, Warwickshire, where her uncle John had moved, now widowed. Here she took up employment as a social worker dealing with local underprivileged people. When her father retired and moved to England, she moved into his house in Bushey Heath, Hertfordshire, living with him until his death in 1891. In 1893 she then travelled to Madras, Tamil Nadu, where <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> moved to with her new husband.|$|E

25|$|Iroquois {{was ordered}} on 5 April 1940 {{as part of}} the 1940 {{shipbuilding}} programme. The destroyer was laid down on 19 September 1940 by Vickers-Armstrong at Newcastle on Tyne in the United Kingdom and launched 23 September the following year. Iroquois was originally laid down as Athabaskan. However, due to bomb damage, she and <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> their names switched in order to ensure Iroquois commissioned first. She was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy at Newcastle on Tyne on 30 November 1942. The destroyer was not completed until 30 January 1943.|$|E
25|$|In September 1937, the ship, {{bound to}} Barcelona from Odessa, was {{diverted}} by her captain {{and part of}} the crew towards Cagliari, Sardinia, where the Nationalist had an improvised naval base with the support of Fascist Italy. After seeing some activity as a supply ship, the merchant was converted into a naval unit at the same shipyard where she and <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> been built, the SECN facilities on the Nervion river, near Bilbao. She was equipped with four 152mm Vickers main guns, four 88 mm, four 47 mm Armstrong, three 20 mm Scotti and three depth-charge launchers.|$|E

40|$|Many {{previous}} studies have used sibling correlations to measure the effect of family background on earnings, income? and occupational status. This paper uses data on a sample of sisters to explore {{the importance of family}} background as a determinant of welfare program participation. The results show a strikingly high degree of sibling resemblance in welfare receipt. For example, a woman's estimated probability of having participated in welfare programs is. 20 if <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>has</b> not participated, but is -. 66 if <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>has</b> participated. ...|$|R
25|$|One of {{her more}} unusual {{commissions}} came in 1896, when Emily Dickinson's sister Lavinia arranged for Hills to retouch {{one of the}} few existing photographs of the deceased poet, an austere formal portrait that had been taken when Dickinson was around 16 and which neither Dickinson nor <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> thought was a good likeness. Hills used the photograph as a base to create a memorial portrait; the result, featuring a softened, curlier hairline and a frilly-necked dress, pleased Lavinia. Between 1913 and 1937, this portrait appeared in half a dozen volumes of work by and about the poet that were produced by Dickinson's niece Martha Dickenson Bianchi.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} whether Rasputin's two daughters were present at Rasputin's burial in Vyrubova's garden, next to the Alexander Palace and the {{surrounding}} park, although Maria claimed she was. The two sisters were invited in the Alexandra palace to play with the four grand duchesses, quite often referred to as OTMA; meanwhile, Maria and <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> moved into a smaller apartment, owned by her French teacher. They each received an allowance of 50.000 Rubles. In April 1917, their mother returned to Prokovskoe. On the next day the two sisters were locked up in the Tauride Palace and questioned. Boris Soloviev succeeded in gaining their release.|$|E
25|$|Responding to {{the success}} of Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and their rival Deutschland, a sister to the former was ordered. Named in honour of Crown Prince Wilhelm, she would have a varied career. Her transatlantic maiden voyage on 17 September 1901 was from Bremerhaven, via Southampton and Cherbourg, to New York City. In 1902, she transported Prince Henry of Prussia to America and was also visited by her namesake. In September the same year, she won the Blue Riband, as <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> done in 1898. This, however, was quickly taken by Deutschland. From 1914 she was an {{auxiliary}} cruiser for the Imperial German Navy, sailing as a commerce raider for a year. Highly successful in this role, when the United States entered the war, she was seized in April 1917 and served as a Navy troop transport until 1919. Renamed USS Von Steuben (ID-3017) at capture, she was decommissioned and turned over to the United States Shipping Board, where she remained in service until she was scrapped in 1923.|$|E

500|$|The first {{performances}} of She Has a Name in the United States were produced by FreeFall Stage {{in a rented}} space at Victory Life Church in Folsom, California in 2014 {{under the direction of}} Emma Eldridge, who was a 23-year-old college student at the time. She and <b>her</b> <b>sister</b> <b>had</b> become passionate about the issue of human trafficking {{as a result of their}} involvement with the organization Run for Courage, and the two sisters considered writing a play about human trafficking in the United States. Because they were both college students, they did not find the time to write a play, so in 2013, their mother, Deedee Eldridge, began looking for a human-trafficking-related play that had already been written and she discovered She Has a Name. It was the only play she was able to find on the subject of human trafficking. Emma Eldridge later said of She Has a Name, [...] "I've never read something and been so compelled to do it." [...] The family decided to stage the play, and Deedee Eldridge served as producer and executive director. To have the rights to produce the play, FreeFall Stage made a special arrangement with the Playwrights Guild of Canada.|$|E
