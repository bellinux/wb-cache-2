50|$|<b>Heatshrink</b> tubing is {{sometimes}} sold in pre-cut lengths, with a solder blob {{at the center}} of the length, as this configuration is specified by Daimler-Benz for automotive electrical repairs.|$|E
50|$|One {{application}} that has used <b>heatshrink</b> {{in large quantities}} since the early 1970s is the covering of fibreglass helical antennas, used extensively for 27 MHz CB Radio. Many millions of these antennas have been coated this way.|$|E
50|$|Heat-shrink tubing (or, commonly, {{heat shrink}} or <b>heatshrink)</b> is a {{shrinkable}} plastic tube used to insulate wires, providing abrasion resistance {{and environmental protection}} for stranded and solid wire conductors, connections, joints and terminals in electrical work. It {{can also be used}} to repair the insulation on wires or to bundle them together, to protect wires or small parts from minor abrasion, and to create cable entry seals, offering environmental sealing protection. Heat-shrink tubing is ordinarily made of nylon or polyolefin, which shrinks radially (but not longitudinally) when heated, to between one-half and one-sixth of its diameter.|$|E
50|$|The unshrunk tubing is fitted on {{the wire}} before making the connection, then slid down to cover the joint after it is made. If the fit is tight, {{silicone}} lubricant can be applied without compromising the heat-shrink material. The tubing is then shrunk to wrap tightly around the joint by heating in an oven or with a hot air gun or other source of hot gas flow. Convenient but less consistent methods for shrinking the tube include a soldering iron held close to but not touching the tube, or the heat from a lighter. Uncontrolled heat can cause uneven shrinkage, physical damage and insulation failure, and these methods are not recommended by <b>heatshrink</b> suppliers. If overheated, heat-shrink tubing can melt, scorch or catch fire like any other plastic. Heating causes the tubing to contract to between half and one sixth of its original diameter, depending on the material used, providing a snug fit over irregularly shaped joints. There is also longitudinal shrinking, usually unwanted {{and to a lesser}} extent than narrowing, of typically around 6%. The tubing provides good electrical insulation, protection from dust, solvents and other foreign materials, and mechanical strain relief, and is mechanically held in place (unless incorrectly oversized or not properly shrunk) by its tight fit.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{quality of}} {{machined}} surfaces is significantly influenced by machine vibrations {{caused by the}} cutting process. Whereas most publications ignore {{the influence of the}} tool holder, this paper considers the dynamic behaviour of the whole cutting system consisting of spindle, tool holder, tool and workpiece. Therefore modal and operational vibration analyses were performed to describe the damping and operational characteristics of two competing tool holder technologies, namely <b>heatshrink</b> (HS) and hydraulic expansion (HE). It is shown that HE has higher damping rates than HS. Therefore, HE showed mainly better surface qualities, a 10 % higher productivity and an up to 300 % higher achievable life time of tools...|$|E
