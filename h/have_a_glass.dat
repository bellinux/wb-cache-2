5|$|Thermoplastics, by contrast, form long {{molecular}} chains, {{which are}} often coiled or intertwined, forming an amorphous structure without any long-range, crystalline order. Some thermoplastics may be fully amorphous, while others have a partially crystalline/partially amorphous structure. Both amorphous and semicrystalline thermoplastics <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> transition, above which welding can occur, but semicrystallines also have a specific melting point which is above the glass transition. Above this melting point, the viscous liquid will become a free-flowing liquid (see rheological weldability for thermoplastics). Examples of thermoplastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride (PVC), and fluoroplastics like Teflon and Spectralon.|$|E

2500|$|At The Wigwam, Chief Flying Hawk {{could have}} rest and relaxation. Show touring {{schedules}} were grueling, each spring through fall, with performances twice daily. Traveling, pony riding, war dances and inclement weather weighed on Chief Flying Hawk’s health. [...] Here he could rise with {{the morning sun}} {{for a walk in}} the forest, enjoy a breakfast of bacon and eggs, with fruit and coffee, smoke his redstone pipe and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> of sherry before retiring. Chief Flying Hawk preferred to sleep on the enclosed sun porch at The Wigwam with his robes and blankets and could not be induced to sleep on a white man’s mattress and springs. He refused to be sent to a bedroom, and asked to have the buffalo robes and blankets. With them he made his couch on the open veranda floor, where he retired in the moonlight. McCreight was impressed with Chief Flying Hawk’s grace and dignity: [...] "The Chief was engaged in taking down his long hair-plaits in which were woven strips of otter fur. From his kit sack he took his comb and bottle of bear’s oil and carefully combed and oiled his hair, made up new plaits, then applied a little paint to his cheeks, looked into a small hand-mirror, and was ready to answer questions. His hair, now still reaching to his waist, was streaked with grey. In reply to how Indians were able to retain their hair in such perfect condition, he said they did always retain it, sometimes they got scalped, but they prided themselves in caring for their bodies. He said that long ago Indians often had hair that reached the ground." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Wigwam was Chief Flying Hawk’s {{second home}} for nearly thirty years. Traveling with Wild West shows, pony riding, war dances and inclement weather weighed on Chief Flying Hawk’s health.

Chief Flying Hawk, “refused to be sent to a bedroom, and asked to have the buffalo robes and blankets.

He said that long ago Indians often had hair that reached the ground.” [...] However, even in the relaxed atmosphere of The Wigwam, there was a formality to the visits. Of importance, Flying Hawk was an Oglala Lakota Chief and it was his duty to display his beautiful eagle feather “Chief’s Wand” during visits to The Wigwam. [...] “At sun-up the Chief was missing. [...] Breakfast was delayed. Presently, Chief Flying Hawk was seen coming from the forest which nearly surrounds The Wigwam. In his hand he carried a green switch six feet in length. [...] From his traveling bag he took a bundle which he carefully unfolded and laid out, a beautiful eagle feather streamer which he attached to the pole at either end. [...] After testing it in the breeze he handed it to McCreight with gentle admonishment to keep it in a place where it could always been seen. [...] It was the Chief’s “wand,” and he said it must always be kept where it could be seen, else people would not know who was Chief. [...] Having disposed of this, to him, important duty, the Chief was ready for breakfast.” ...|$|E
