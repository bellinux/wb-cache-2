40|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was {{expected}} to cause an overall decline <b>in</b> business fixed <b>investment</b> and {{a shift in the}} composition of investment away from machinery and equipment, which previously had received an investment tax credit. Yet neither investment relative to GNP nor equipment investment relative to total investment declined during the period 1987 - 89.

We find that the trend toward <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>equipment</b> predated the Act, and that recent <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>equipment</b> has fallen short of what would have been expected on the basis on nontax factors alone.

Once the decision to commit resources has been taken, larger firms, firms that are foreign-owned, and firms that report low shares of water and refuse charges in turnover have higher absolute levels of environmental expenditure. With respect to <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>equipment</b> for pollution control, we find that energy intensive and exporting firms are more likely to invest at all.

40|$|AbstractIn India, micro, {{small and}} {{medium-sized}} enterprises (micro SMEs) {{play an important role in}} the country's economic development. According to RBI, the definition of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) is as follows:Enterprises engaged in providing or rendering of services and whose <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>equipment</b> (original cost excluding land and building and furniture, fittings and other items not directly related to the service rendered or as may be notified under the MSMED Act, 2006 are specified below. a) A micro enterprise is an enterprise where the <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>equipment</b> does not exceed Rs. 10 lakh;b) A small enterprise is an enterprise where the <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>equipment</b> is more than Rs. 10 lakh but does not exceed Rs. 2 crore; andc) A medium enterprise is an enterprise where the <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>equipment</b> is more than Rs. 2 crore but does not exceed Rs. 5 crore. The research paper focuses on the point (a) of the above definition: The micro enterprises. Finance forms the most critical input for a business enterprise whether large or small. All firms require financing to grow and survive. Sources of finance may be external, such as loans, equity infusions, subsidies and government grants, or internal such as generated cash flows or owned funds. Many firms are self- financed in the beginning. Once the firms reach certain degree of maturity in the development of their product line and customer base, external finance becomes available. The flow of institutional finance is linked with the credit worthiness of the enterprise. Micro enterprises, due to their small size and low capital base, generally find it difficult to satisfy the conditions laid down by the banks, particularly, in establishing the viability of the project, meeting collateral requirements and making timely repayment of loans. Hence, they do not find a place among the preferred clients of the banks. In today's world, micro businesses and particularly new ones are seen more than ever as a vehicle for entrepreneurship, contributing not just to employment, social and political stability, but also to innovative and competitive power. The focus has shifted from small businesses as a social good that should be maintained at an economic cost, to small businesses as a vehicle for entrepreneurship. With this shift came the renewed perception of the important role of entrepreneurship. Indeed, recent econometric evidence suggests that entrepreneurship is a vital determinant of economic growth...|$|R
40|$|Changes <b>in</b> firms' <b>investment</b> {{expenditures}} are {{considered one of}} the primary channels through which energy price shocks are transmitted to the economy. It is widely believed that the response of business fixed investment to energy price increases differs from its response to energy price decreases. We show that the apparent symmetry in the estimated responses of business fixed <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>equipment</b> and structures cannot be reconciled with standard theoretical explanations of asymmetric responses. Rather this evidence is an artifact (1) of the aggregation of mining-related expenditures by the oil, natural gas, and coal mining industry and all other expenditures, and (2) of ignoring an exogenous shift <b>in</b> <b>investment</b> caused by the 1986 Tax Reform Act. After controlling for these factors, formal statistical tests are unable to reject the hypothesis of symmetric responses to energy price shocks for all components of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> structures. For nonresidential equipment there is weak statistical evidence of classical asymmetries in some components, but not in the aggregate. Once symmetry is imposed and mining-related {{expenditures are}} excluded, the estimated response of business fixed <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>equipment</b> and structures tends to be small and statistically insignificant. Historical decompositions show that energy price shocks have played a minor role in driving fluctuations <b>in</b> nonresidential fixed <b>investment</b> other than <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> mining. ...|$|R
