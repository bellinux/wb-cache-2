25|$|By {{the end of}} September 1957, {{the nine}} were {{admitted}} to Little Rock Central High {{under the protection of}} the 101st Airborne Division (and later the Arkansas National Guard), but they were still subjected to a year of physical and verbal abuse (being spat on and called names) by many of the white students. Melba Pattillo had acid thrown <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and also recalled in her book, Warriors Don't Cry, an incident in which a group of white girls trapped her in a stall in the girls' washroom and attempted to burn her by dropping pieces of flaming paper on her from above. Another one of the students, Minnijean Brown, was verbally confronted and abused. She said I was one of the kids 'approved' by the school officials. We were told we would have to take a lot and were warned not to fight back if anything happened. One girl ran up to me and said, 'I'm so glad you're here. Won't you go to lunch with me today?' I never saw her again.|$|E

500|$|As the Fringe {{division}} {{sets out}} to Roland's home, Roland injects Amanda's body {{with more of the}} serum, and she is brought back to life. By the time Fringe arrives, Roland gives himself up willingly, and they find Amanda dead again. Roland explains that though she was alive, when he looked <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> he realized she wasn't the same person and thus terminated the process. As Roland and Amanda's body are taken away, Olivia breaks down in front of Peter; she questions that if Roland could tell that Amanda wasn't the same person by looking at her eyes, why couldn't Peter do the same with Fauxlivia? Peter is unable to answer her, and a distressed Olivia leaves on her own. As Walter takes Peter to get a milkshake, the two are identified by an Observer, who reports on his phone that [...] "he is still alive".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} emulates the title {{sequences}} of Bond films from the 1960s to present-day, high-tech 3D designs. In the opening sequence, {{one of the}} graphics turns into a wire frame of a beating electronic heart, which [...] "pulls out" [...] with each beat. As the camera zooms, the heart grows in size and [...] "weaves" [...] to become Duff. According to MTV News, while she doesn't [...] "take on" [...] Pussy Galore, Plenty O'Toole, Holly Goodhead, or any other Bond girl, she becomes a [...] "Bond girl in spirit", switching from era to era with different looks, with her hair blowing and flying around in graphic silhouettes. Instead of cutting from image to image, the shots evolve in a Bond-like style [...] "as shapes take on different forms to reveal something else". Duff performs in silhouette, with a microphone, [...] "where a gun would otherwise be". In another shot, her band is a silhouette. The edition of the video is matched {{to the beat of}} the song, [...] "zapping the view in and out, until a lull in the song, when the view travels back <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> through her skin and back to her beating heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Weiss {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} the introduction of Lyanna Mormont in the series, with Weiss saying, [...] "We were excited {{about the prospect of}} the character because she's mentioned in passing in the previous season," [...] referring to her letter to Stannis denying him men, and swearing fealty to House Stark. Weiss added, [...] "The more we thought about it, Jon is going to come up against so many old guys with beards in the North that like 'What if she was a tougher audience?' It seemed like an inherently fun scene to watch, it also is terrifying because it's putting a lot of dramatic weight on the shoulders of somebody who needs to be very young." [...] David Benioff concluded the featurette speaking about the Ironborn story, noting [...] "Yara's not a therapist, in our kind of sense of the word, she's not there to tell him to 'buck up' and 'everything's going to be okay,' it's a pretty brutal kind of therapy, but that's who they are, I mean they're essentially a Viking people. There's not {{a lot of room for}} sort of soft, and gentle psychology. I think it's the kind of tough love Theon needed at this point, and when he finally raises his eyes, and looks <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> we see a glimpse of the old Theon that had been lost for so long." ...|$|E

500|$|... 30 years-old at {{the time}} of her audition, O'Hara {{consequently}} imbued Belle's voice with a mature, [...] "womanly quality" [...] despite the character's young age. Woolverton appreciated the fact that O'Hara sounded more mature than traditional Disney heroines. Additionally, O'Hara identified with her character because they were both ostracized by their peers throughout their childhood because of their unconventional interests, explaining, [...] "I was odd growing up myself. I mean, I was into musical theater and Gershwin and Rodgers and Hammerstein while people were going to Led Zeppelin concerts. So I understood that ... I wasn't the norm either. I was very focused on my career, on my performing all through my childhood and my teens ... I had a one-track mind, and I think that Belle was like that a lot." [...] O'Hara also shares Belle's interest in reading. Wise was pleased with the quality of O'Hara's voice, which reminded him of Garland. O'Hara initially found it challenging to control her speaking volume due to having been trained to project as a stage actress. O'Hara told The Guardian that to solve this she [...] "softened and used the microphone." [...] As per the filmmakers' encouragement, the actress would occasionally ad-lib her own dialogue, none was included in the final film because it sounded [...] "too modern". The animators would videotape O'Hara daily while she recorded to incorporate her [...] "quirky" [...] mannerisms, expressions and gestures into the character, among them her hair constantly falling <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> O'Hara and American actor Robby Benson, who provides the voice of the Beast, asked Disney to allow the co-stars to record together as opposed to the traditional method of being isolated in a recording booth, to which the studio agreed despite its costliness. O'Hara credited the filmmaker's decision with developing both the film and Belle and the Beast's relationship. O'Hara and Benson became the first Disney voice actors to record together. In total, the recording process took over two years to complete. O'Hara had already been friends with co-star Richard White, who voices Gaston, for 15 years. Despite her successful stage career, O'Hara was virtually unknown to Hollywood audiences when she was cast in Beauty and the Beast; she was one of the last obscure actresses to be cast in a feature-length Disney animated film before the studio began casting better known talent in subsequent animated projects.|$|E
2500|$|... 28th May, 1719. I {{went to see}} {{her last}} Sunday, the 23rd May, and found her in a sad state, {{suffering}} from pains in her toes and the soles of her feet until the tears came <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> I went away because I saw that she refrained from crying out on my account. I thought {{she was in a}} bad way. A consultation was held by her three physicians, the result of which was that they determined to bleed her in the feet. They had some difficulty in persuading her to submit to it, because the pain in her feet was so great that she uttered the most piercing screams if the bedclothes only rubbed against them. The bleeding, however, succeeded, and she was in some degree relieved. It was the gout in both feet ...|$|E
2500|$|In Mortal Kombat II (1993), Jade was {{a mysterious}} hidden {{character}} who plays {{no part in}} the game's storyline other than appearing {{at the start of}} random fights to drop cryptic clues on how to access her; players have to then meet particular requirements during gameplay in order to fight Jade in a secret battle in the [...] "Goro's Lair" [...] stage from the first game. She is wearing a green outfit similar to that of Kitana and Mileena and fights with increased speed and Kitana's fans. Though she identifies herself in one of the clues, her energy bar was left blank in the arcade game but was included in the home versions. In , the 2005 beat 'em up action-adventure spinoff that retold the events of MKII, she engages Liu Kang and Kung Lao in a fight alongside Mileena and a brainwashed Kitana. After Jade is defeated, she is then killed when the player character stabs Mileena's sai <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Brangäne {{returns to}} Isolde to relate these events, and Isolde, {{in what is}} termed the [...] "narrative and curse", sadly tells her of how, {{following}} the death of Morold, she happened upon a stranger who called himself Tantris. Tantris was found mortally wounded in a barge ("von einem Kahn, der klein und arm"' and Isolde used her healing powers to restore him to health. She discovered during Tantris' recovery, however, that he was actually Tristan, the murderer of her fiancé. Isolde attempted to kill the man with his own sword as he lay helpless before her. However, Tristan looked not at the sword that would kill him or the hand that wielded the sword, but <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> ("Er sah' mir in die Augen"). His action pierced her heart and she was unable to slay him. Tristan was allowed to leave with the promise never to come back, but he later returned with the intention of marrying Isolde to his uncle, King Marke. Isolde, furious at Tristan's betrayal, insists that he drink atonement to her, and from her medicine chest produces a vial to make the drink. Brangäne is shocked to see that it is a lethal poison.|$|E

25|$|This {{series was}} far more {{successful}} with viewing figures than the first, securing ratings of 2.89 to 3.92 million, with the final episode receiving higher viewing figures than the episode of Extras which aired beforehand. Celebrities such as Peter Kay and Jill Halfpenny made guest appearances in series two. The series also had new theme music composed by Howard Goodall. For the opening, various characters are in an open field. The camera closes in on Lauren Cooper, zooms <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> then zooms out of Sheila Carter's eye. The camera pans to the right, where Bernie enters. The camera zooms <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye,</b> then zooms out of Nan's eye, where she is seen laughing. The end of the sequence shows the main title The Catherine Tate Show. The zooming {{is the same for}} both series two and three although Shelia Carter does not appear in series three (in the 2007 Christmas Special, Sheila is replaced by Geordie Georgie).|$|R
