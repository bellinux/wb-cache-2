Although the production of customer cars continued briefly under Ecclestone's ownership, he believed the company needed to focus on Formula One to succeed. The last production customer Brabhams were the Formula Two BT40 and the Formula Three BT41 of 1973, although Ecclestone sold <b>ex-works</b> Formula One BT44Bs to RAM Racing as late as 1976.|$|E
500|$|Operational livery was <b>ex-works</b> {{photographic}} grey {{with red}} and white lining. [...] The British Railways [...] "Cycling Lion" [...] crest was also used though, after the works photograph, this was painted over without explanation. Numbering was the British Railways standard system, in the 36001 series. If the class had gone into full production, the locomotives would have been painted in British Railways mixed traffic/freight black livery with red, grey and cream lining. 36001 was initially painted in this livery but this preceded the official works photograph and was subsequently repainted in photographic grey livery.|$|E
2500|$|As well {{as being}} a racing team Cooper {{was very much a}} business, as shown by the 1958 International Trophy where 19 Coopers of various types made up more than half the grid. Right from the outset the T51 was {{designed}} to be produced in large numbers and offered for sale to privateer teams, with Rob Walker getting full-works cars and the rest receiving slightly more workmanlike models. No fewer than ten other entrants ran T51s in Formula 1 during 1959, and with the works team switching to the T53, and Walker using Lotus 18s, many of the <b>ex-works</b> cars were sold and continued to be entered in 1960. Indeed, the T51 continued to appear on minor, non-championship F1 race entry lists as late as the 1967 Rhodesian Grand Prix! ...|$|E
30|$|The data {{limitations}} notwithstanding, a {{trend to}} {{the prevalence of}} VPT asymmetries toward price increase seems to prevail both from <b>ex-work</b> to retail price and the other way around. On the one hand, this means that when <b>ex-work</b> price increased, retail price followed. However, {{it also means that}} the reduction of <b>ex-work</b> price was not fully transmitted to retail, causing the distance in absolute terms between <b>ex-work</b> and retail prices of sugar in the EU to tendentially increase over time.|$|R
30|$|The {{empirical}} assessment investigated about {{intensity and}} speed of VPT and {{on the existence of}} asymmetries. The visual inspection revealed that the three-step reduction of sugar intervention price between 2006 / 07 and 2009 / 10 (and conclusion of intervention purchases from the 2010 / 11 campaign onwards), which was implemented by the 2006 reform, did not fully translate in a decrease of <b>ex-work</b> sugar prices in the EU. Indeed, <b>ex-work</b> prices stayed well above the intervention price {{until the end of the}} 2009 / 10 marketing year, and kept a wide margin over the reference price from October 2009 onwards. Evidence also suggests that the reduction of sugar beet minimum prices introduced by the 2006 reform did not fully translate into an equivalent decrease of sugar beet prices.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{humanoid}} robot {{is a combination}} of biped, intelligent and mimetic robot to serve human beings in non-production sectors. Since it is a very complicate automatic walking and working machinery, and it works interactively with people in daily life, its correctness and reliability in terms of its functions and performances need to be checked intensively after final assemble and before it is shipped. A novel developed computer integrated testing system (CITS) to inspect every <b>ex-work</b> robot before shipping with the appearance, motion, walking, sensing and recognition, intelligence as well as possessed service expert knowledge is developed in this paper. The use of this fully automated CITS will simplify the human intervenient inspection and testing of the {{humanoid robot}}, shorten the testing time and cost, and avoid human errors while in manufacturing, software loading and <b>ex-work</b> inspection...|$|R
2500|$|The BRABUS Tailor-Made {{program is}} not well advertised in Canada, but at least 16 Tailor-Made cars have been {{produced}} to Canadian specification. [...] These vehicles are sent to the BRABUS factory in Bottrop, Germany, where the standard <b>ex-works</b> cars are stripped to the shell and repainted/retrimmed to suit individual customers' tastes. [...] The first four are the BRABUS Canada 1; three in bright red (including the tridion, two cabriolets and one coupé) and one in all white (a cabriolet). [...] Aside from the special paint, all had every BRABUS part fitted to the body and interior, and the seats, door panels and dashboards were trimmed in black Nappa leather and Alcantara. [...] Three of these cars are in British Columbia and #1-of-1, the Concept vehicle used at Canadian International Auto Shows (a red cabrio with silver alloys), is now in London, Ontario. [...] The next BRABUS Tailor-Made Canadian car was a one-off all orange 451 made for a customer in Vancouver. [...] The other ten were all ordered by Mercedes-Benz Canada as the special [...] "edit10n" [...] of the Canadian BRABUS 451 (with only 70 HP), painted in metallic dark grey with an orange Nappe leather interior. [...] There is also at least one BoConcept 451 built to Canadian standards.|$|E

30|$|Actually, the {{functioning}} of vertical price transmission in the sugar sector is remarkably affected {{by the state of}} competition in the downstream levels of the supply chain (food industry, distribution), over which the EU sugar regime bears no direct influence. The assessment highlighted the evident asymmetry toward price increases with retail prices reacting to increases more often than to decreases in <b>ex-work</b> prices. This implies that operators in the downstream sectors are prone to adopting such pricing behaviour: it is unlikely that they will change it in absence of any pressure in this direction.|$|R

50|$|Like many {{of their}} Flying Nun stable-mates, the band hailed from the {{southern}} city of Dunedin. They formed from the ashes of The DoubleHappys, a band comprising Shayne Carter, Wayne Elsey and John Collie. The tragic accidental death of Elsey saw Carter and Collie join forces with David Wood (<b>ex-Working</b> With Walt) in 1986 to form Straitjacket Fits. Andrew Brough (from The Orange) signed on the following year, adding a foil {{in the form of a}} pop sensibility to Carter's more raucous songwriting. From their inception, the sound of the band was marked by the seemingly incongruous but effective pairing of Carter's rough abrasive voice and strident guitar and Andrew Brough's saccharine-sweet vocals and pop hooks.|$|R
3000|$|Speed, {{intensity}} {{and the existence}} of asymmetry were also investigated. The sugar industry was the pivotal reference to test price transmission. VPT was tested upstream toward agricultural sector for sugar beet price, and downstream toward the retailing sector for retail price. Tests were performed in the relevant sugar-producing countries and different EU Member State aggregations (EU- 15, NMS- 12, EU- 25 and EU- 27), depending on the specific issue. The potential effects of the reform were analysed taking into account the absolute level of price, its variation and the relation between prices occurring within two different markets over a certain time span. In particular, VPT was tested by taking into account the relation between <b>ex-work</b> and retail prices and vice versa in the pre- and post-reform periods. 3 [...]...|$|R
30|$|If {{it is true}} {{that the}} ALI {{constitutes}} a synthetic index of the degree of competition which takes into account also the effect of increased sugar imports, and hence of the possible entry of new operators on the EU market, it should be conceded that it cannot adequately represent the many qualitative aspects which may determine actual competition within the EU sugar sector. In this respect, it is also extremely important to underline that the average EU <b>ex-work</b> sugar price remarkably increased over the first months of 2012 in comparison with late 2011 levels. Such price dynamics might have affected the recent evolution of the ALI, especially if sugar production cost has not experienced an analogous evolution over the same period. Hence, these price dynamics also suggest that EU sugar producers might again be exerting remarkable market power, keeping in mind that price dynamics on the EU market mainly derive from the evolution of market fundamentals, which can be influenced by policy decisions taken by the European Commission.|$|R

30|$|Due to {{confidentiality}} issues concerning sugar production cost data, {{an ad hoc}} procedure was adopted to treat the Lerner Index—defined as [(sugar price − sugar production cost)/(sugar price)]—in the assessment, thus shaping {{a modified version of}} the Lerner index. Time series of the Lerner Index were calculated by DG Agriculture on the basis of sugar <b>ex-work</b> prices and of LMC International sugar production cost data. The values of the Lerner Index were then multiplied by an unknown constant, different for each Member State. The resulting time series are referred to in this study as “Adjusted Lerner Index” (ALI). The abovementioned procedure allowed comparisons of time series of the ALI between Member States only in terms of dynamics, not of absolute level of the ALI itself. We assessed the effects of the reform on competition by observing the evolution of the index against the succession of policy-related and industry-related significant events (see Table  2 above), which we considered in the study of the evolution of other variables concerning competition as well (number of producers, number of beet sugar factories in operation, average production capacity of such factories).|$|R

This pair also finished second in the next race, the 500 km Vallelunga. He would not finish in the points again in that season, but still took seventh overall. Having switched to the German Castrol Team Zakspeed outfit for 1975 to race their Escort RS 1600, he immediately returned to the podium, finishing second in the 4 Ore di Monza, with his new partner, Hans Heyer, and again in the Grand Prix Brno. Although he was placed seventh overall, he scored points for being third in class in the Zandvoort Trophy. His last podium finish occurred in the 4 Horas de Jarama, when paired with Umberto Grano and Walter Dona in the Jolly Club entered Escort. He would end the season in third place in the overall standings. The 1976 season was spoiled by numerous DNFs.|$|R
50|$|The Höfner {{company was}} founded by luthier Karl Höfner {{in the city of}} Schönbach in 1887, {{at a time when the}} city, later to become part of the Czech Republic, was {{populated}} by Germans. He soon became the largest manufacturer of string instruments in the country. His sons Josef and Walter joined the company around 1920, and began spreading the brand's reputation worldwide. The company became involved in production for the German army in World War II producing wooden crates and soles for boots. After the war Germans were expelled from the Sudetenland and Hofner was forced to move to West Germany. The company initially moved to an <b>ex-work</b> camp at Möhrendorf in 1948 but soon became involved in the development of a new township and factories in Bubenreuth. The new Höfner factory was opened in 1950. This was expanded three times between 1953 and 1960. Karl Höfner, the founder, lived to see the company revival and died in Bubenreuth in 1955. In 1964 a further factory was built at Hagenau about 5 km from Bubenreuth. This was used for the machining of wooden parts that were then assembled at Bubenreuth. The factory at Hagenau was expanded twice in the 1970s.|$|R
