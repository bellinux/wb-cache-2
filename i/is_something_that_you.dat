500|$|Katie Hasty of HitFix was not {{impressed}} by the lyrical potential of the song, stating that with lines like [...] "sunburned baby / hurts like crazy," [...] "we're just some silly heartbreakers tonight" [...] and rhyming [...] "yum yum" [...] with [...] "some some" [...] won't get this song [...] "very good scores on the SAT". She concluded by stating that: [...] "In fact, it seems that Lopez goes {{out of her way}} to sing with a little-girl inflection to her 41-year-old pipes. But it comes off youthful, upbeat, and a little lighter than the single [...] and her island-inflected collaboration with Lil Wayne, 'I'm Into You'." [...] Amos Barshad of Vulture questioned Lopez' music, stating that [...] "with the other facets of her multimedia empire clicking [...] why does she insist on continuing to make music? Why not sit back, relax, and enjoy the fact that there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do that people like? [...] Well, one can only assume, Jennifer Lopez keeps making music because Jennifer Lopez actually loves making music. And that's admirable".|$|E

2500|$|Norman Sanders {{calls the}} play [...] "almost a {{complete}} anthology of {{the practices of}} the doctrine of romantic love which inspired the poetic and prose Romances of the period." [...] At the very centre of this is the contest between love and friendship; [...] "an essential part of the comicality of The Two Gentlemen of Verona is created by the necessary conflict between highly stylised concepts of love and friendship." [...] This is manifested in {{the question of whether the}} relationship between two male friends is more important than that between lovers, encapsulated by Proteus' rhetorical question at 5.4.54; [...] "In love/Who respects friend?" [...] This question [...] "exposes the raw nerve at the heart of the central relationships, the dark reality lurking beneath the wit and lyricism with which the play has in general presented lovers' behaviour." [...] In the program notes for John Barton's 1981 RSC production at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Anne Barton, his wife, wrote that the central theme of the play was [...] "how to bring love and friendship into a constructive and mutually enhancing relationship." [...] As William C. Carroll points out, this is a common theme in Renaissance literature, which often celebrates friendship as the more important relationship (because it is pure and unconcerned with sexual attraction), and contends that love and friendship cannot co-exist. As actor Alex Avery argues, [...] "The love between two men is a greater love for some reason. There seems to be a sense that the function of a male/female relationship is purely for the family and to procreate, to have a family. But a love between two men <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> choose. You have arranged marriages, [...] a friendship between two men is created by the desires and wills of those two men, whereas a relationship between a man and a girl is actually constructed completely peripheral to whatever the feelings of the said boy and girl are." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Mrs. Makely assented, [...] "I {{suppose it}} is. All foreigners find it so. In fact, it <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{have to live}} into the notion of; it can't be explained." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Very well; that's {{a hopeful}} sign.

6000|$|She {{spoke at}} last {{because she could}} put it off no longer, rather than because the right time had come. She began as they sat at breakfast.

6000|$|Later.--When the Professor came in, {{we talked}} {{over the state}} of things. I {{could see that he}} had {{something}} on his mind, which he wanted to say, but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject. After beating about the bush a little, he said, [...] "Friend John, there <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> and I must talk of alone, just at the first at any rate. Later, we may have to take the others into our confidence." ...|$|E
6000|$|This time I {{could not}} resent his insinuation, for {{since he had}} begun to speak I had become guiltily aware of having felt a sort of ease in regard to Kendricks's modesty of {{competence}} from a belief, given me, I suspect, by the talk of Deering, that Mr. Gage had plenty of money, and could come to the rescue in any amount needed. I could only say, [...] "Mr. Gage, all this is so far beyond my control that I ought not to allow you to say it to me. It <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must say to Mr. Kendricks." ...|$|E
5000|$|Armstrong {{expanded}} on {{the song}} to NewReleaseTuesday: [...] "It's basically the keystone {{of the whole}} record, the embodiment of what the whole record will be about finding identity. I think that this song is more about realization; you wake {{up one day and}} <b>you</b> find yourself <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> never wanted to be. <b>You</b> find <b>that</b> the world has kind of gotten itself in your head and turned <b>you</b> into <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> never really meant to be. This song is kind of about a person screaming out with that realization, I'm hollow and faceless. I {{need to do something about}} this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not to me? I {{should not}} like you the less for telling me. Do tell me." [...] And she pressed her hand again upon his arm. [...] "I have known there <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> made <b>you</b> unhappy." ...|$|R

60|$|Here <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{can have}} a pull at, when I have {{finished}} to-day. It is a little apparatus of two hollow brass hemispheres, closely fitted together, and having connected with it a pipe and a cock, through which we can exhaust the air from the inside; and although the two halves are so easily taken apart, while the air is left within, yet you will see, when we exhaust it by-and-by, no power of any two of {{you will be able}} to pull them apart. Every square inch of surface that is contained in the area of that vessel sustains fifteen pounds by weight, or nearly so, when the air is taken out; and you may try your strength presently in seeing whether you can overcome that pressure of the atmosphere.|$|E
60|$|There it lingers, I should say, till dawn, bathing the golden-brown facade in an effulgence that lifelong absence cannot eclipse when {{once it has}} blessed your sight. It is {{beauty that}} rather makes the heart ache, and the charm of the Steps from above <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can bear better if you are very, very worthy, or have the conceit of feeling {{yourself}} so. It is a charm that imparts itself more in detail and is less exclusively the effect of perpetual sunset. From the parapet against which you lean you have a perfecter conception of the architectural form than you get from below, and you are never tired of seeing the successive falls of the Steps dividing themselves and then coming together on the broad landings and again parting and coming together.|$|E

5000|$|In April 2009, she {{questioned}} former Vice President Al Gore {{during an}} energy-related congressional hearing: [...] "The legislation {{that we are}} discussing here today, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> going to personally benefit from?". The Independent, a London-based periodical, has credited her for [...] "famously putGore on the spot about his business interests in the energy industry" [...] during this confrontation. [...] Gore vociferously refuted the implied accusation, claiming every penny he makes from renewable technology investment goes to non-profits.|$|R
2500|$|Their {{music has}} been likened to singers such as Sinéad O'Connor and Siouxsie and the Banshees. O'Riordan stated her singing style {{incorporating}} yodeling was inspired by her father who used to sing [...] "The Lonesome Cattle Call": [...] "I just kept with my father all the time, just copying him and eventually I learned how to do it. Then over the years there were artists like Sinéad O’Connor and Siouxsie from Siouxsie and the Banshees and even Peter Harvey was doing it. It <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could work into The Cranberries’ format {{because a lot of}} that was used in religious Irish music." ...|$|R

50|$|A {{reflexive}} action <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do to yourself. A reciprocal {{action is}} something people do to each other.
