60|$|With {{reluctance}} I {{turned my}} back to the gorgeously changing spectacle of the canyon and crawled in to the rim wall. At the narrow neck of stone <b>I</b> <b>peered</b> over to look down into misty blue nothingness.|$|E

60|$|A {{change in}} my rhythmic motion awakened me. <b>I</b> <b>peered</b> through the refracting glass, and saw that I had come aground upon a huge shallow of sand. Far away I seemed to see houses and trees, and seaward a curve, vague {{distortion}} of a ship hung between sea and sky.|$|E
60|$|Ireland in sight! A {{foreign country}} {{actually}} visible! <b>I</b> <b>peered</b> hard, but {{could see nothing}} but a bluish, cloud-like spot to the northeast. Was that Ireland?

60|$|Thus was {{it with me}} then. I grasped my cudgel {{more firmly}} and unslung my javelin, {{carrying}} it in my left hand. <b>I</b> <b>peered</b> to left and right, but I saw nothing.
