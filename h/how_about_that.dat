500|$|On July 7, he was {{selected}} to his seventh consecutive All-Star Game, played at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati. [...] In the Reds' clubhouse for the All-Star Game, Molina shared a locker with Reds' second baseman Brandon Phillips. [...] Since the brawl between the Cardinals and Reds in 2010, [...] the two mended their schism, and Molina has a photograph of their families together. [...] When informed whose locker he was using, Molina replied, [...] "This is Phillips' locker? [...] <b>How</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> [...] I'll have to write something to him." [...] While the pregame roster introductions were made, Reds fans booed all six Cardinals players who were selected, and even former Cardinal Albert Pujols. [...] When Molina was introduced, he smiled and turned and pointed his thumbs {{toward the back of}} his jersey. [...] Pujols provided levity when he then joined in the booing. [...] After the game, Molina remarked to reporters, [...] "when you spend 12 years coming to Cincinnati and you beat them so many times, they’re going to boo you." [...] In his career to that point, he hit [...]319 with a [...]352 on-base percentage and [...]500 slugging percentage in 270 career at-bats at Great American Ball Park.|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, writing [...] "Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka {{may be a}} stone freak, but he is {{also one}} of Burton's classic crackpot conjurers, like Beetlejuice or Ed Wood." [...] Roger Ebert gave an overall {{positive}} review and enjoyed the film. He was primarily impressed by Tim Burton's direction of the younger cast members, but was disappointed with Depp's performance: [...] "What was Depp thinking of? In [...] he was famously channeling Keith Richards, which may have primed us to look for possible inspirations for this performance." [...] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle found Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Burton's [...] "best work in years. If all the laughs come from Depp, who gives Willy the mannerisms of a classic Hollywood diva, the film's heart comes from Highmore, a gifted young performer whose performance is sincere, deep and unforced in a way that's rare in a child actor." [...] Peter Travers wrote in Rolling Stone magazine that [...] "Depp's deliciously demented take on Willy Wonka demands to be seen. Depp goes deeper to find the bruises on Wonka's secret heart than what Gene Wilder did. Depp and Burton may fly too high on the vapors of pure imagination, but it's hard to not get hooked on something this tasty. And <b>how</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> army of Oompa-Loompas, all played by Deep Roy, in musical numbers that appear to have been choreographed by Busby Berkeley on crack." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some celebrities have {{promoted}} or {{touched upon}} the ineligibility claims, as well. In August 2009, actor Chuck Norris, while not embracing the eligibility claims, wrote {{an open letter}} to Obama urging that he officially release his [...] "original birth certificate", saying, [...] "Refusing to post your original birth certificate is an unwise political and leadership decision that is enabling the 'birther' controversy." [...] In December 2010, Baltimore Orioles baseball player Luke Scott asserted in a Yahoo! interview that Obama [...] "was not born here" [...] and that his birth certificate was never released. The Huffington Post reported that, in April 2011 during his stage show, Charlie Sheen said, [...] "For starters, I was fucking born here, <b>how</b> <b>about</b> <b>that?</b> And I got proof!
