25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the normal}} range of volumes of flatus in normal individuals varies hugely (476–1,491ml/24h). All intestinal gas is either swallowed environmental air, present intrinsically in foods and beverages or the result of gut fermentation. Swallowing small amounts of air occurs while eating and drinking. This is emitted from the mouth by eructation (burping) and is normal. Excessive swallowing of environmental air is called aerophagia, and {{has been shown in}} a few case reports to be responsible for increased flatus volume. This is however considered a rare cause of increased flatus volume. Gases contained in food and beverages is likewise emitted largely through eructation, e.g., carbonated beverages. Endogenously produced <b>intestinal</b> <b>gases</b> make up 74 percent of flatus in normal subjects. The volume of gas produced is partially dependent upon the composition of the intestinal microbiota, which is normally very resistant to change, but is also very different in different individuals. Some patients are predisposed to increased endogenous gas production by virtue of their gut microbiota composition. The greatest concentration of gut bacteria is in the colon, while the small intestine is normally near sterile. Fermentation occurs when unabsorbed food residues may arrive in the colon. Therefore, even more than the composition of the microbiota, diet is the primary factor that dictates the volume of flatus produced. Diets that aim {{to reduce the amount of}} undigested fermentable food residues arriving in the colon have been shown to significantly reduce the volume of flatus produced. Again, it is emphasised that increased volume of intestinal gas will not cause bloating and pain in normal subjects. Abnormal intestinal gas dynamics will create pain, distension, and bloating, regardless of whether there is high or low total flatus volume.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background—Patients with {{irritable}} bowel syndrome (IBS) frequently {{complain of}} excessive gas but their fasting volume of <b>intestinal</b> <b>gas</b> is apparently normal. We hypothesised that the pathophysiological mechanism involved may be impairment of <b>intestinal</b> <b>gas</b> transit. Aim—To investigate <b>intestinal</b> <b>gas</b> transit and tolerance in IBS patients compared with healthy subjects. Methods—A gas mixture (N 2, O 2, and CO 2 in venous proportions) was infused into the jejunum of 20  patients with IBS and 20  healthy controls at 12  ml/min for four hours. Gas evacuation, initially flatus from the anus (two hours) and then intrarectally (two hours), was continuously recorded. Symptom perception (0 - 6 scale) and abdominal distension were measured at 10  minute intervals. Results—After two hours of external gas (flatus) collection, 18  of 20  IBS patients had developed gas retention (> 400 ml), increased gastrointestinal symptoms (score > 3), or abdominal distension (> 3 mm girth increment) compared with only four of 20  control subjects. During intrarectal gas collection, 13  of 17  patients still exhibited abnormal responses.

40|$|Fermentation {{of organic}} {{materials}} by microorganisms {{is an essential}} component {{in a variety of}} medical, industrial and agricultural applications. Many of these fermentations take place in quasi-closed pressure regulated anaerobic fermentation systems and involve the production of different gases. These gases are highly indicative as they are identifiable with biological processes and different bacteria species. Profiling gas components in such systems can assist with their microbial activities analysis, diagnosis and monitoring. However, methods for gas profiling in such fermentation systems lack real-time, accurate, simple, portable and cost-effective gas profiling technologies for continuously measuring gases in both anaerobic headspaces and in liquid media. The aim of this PhD research is to enhance the understanding, diagnosis and monitoring of these systems and their associated applications using gas components. This was specifically achieved by resolving the limitations and inadequacies of gas profiling in quasi-closed pressure regulated anaerobic fermentation systems. Firstly, the author of this thesis thoroughly reviewed the methods utilized for accurate profiling of gas components. Specifically, he focused on profiling <b>intestinal</b> <b>gases</b> produced in-vitro during fecal incubation. Secondly, the author investigated the calculation methods for profiling the production of these gases and their kinetics. Finally, the author explored gas profiling in both liquid and gas phases for in-situ monitoring of anaerobic digestion fermentation systems. The first stage involved addressing limitations of profiling <b>intestinal</b> <b>gases</b> produced by incubation of fecal matters in-vitro. The past available technologies for sensing colonic gases in-vitro were either bulky, expensive, offline or included only limited number of gas types. In addition, the gut environment in-vitro is generally simulated with N 2 as an inert gas where the supplementation of important fermentation gases, such as CO 2 and H 2, was not understood. As such, the author developed a low-cost, portable and real-time gas sensing technology for monitoring CO 2, CH 4, H 2, H 2 S and NOx simultaneously in the anaerobic headspace of fecal fermentation systems in-vitro. The author demonstrated the performance of the new technology on healthy human fecal samples and validated the new technology for both accuracy and reproducibility. The author also explored the impact of the initial headspace environment composition on the fermentation gas profiles. It was found that supplying the reactor with CO 2 enhanced CH 4 and H 2 production and inhibited H 2 S production. Furthermore, it was shown that fecal incubation together with high fermentable fibre could suppress H 2 S production. Finally, the author found that healthy human fecal samples did not produce NOx spontaneously. In the second stage, the author investigated the calculation methods for profiling the production of gases and their kinetics in quasi-closed pressure regulated anaerobic fermentation systems. Surprisingly, the author discovered that there was no existing standardized or comprehensive method for such calculations. Therefore, the author developed a rigorous gas fermentation model and a novel mass-flow equation for accurately profiling the produced gases and introduced these into the literature. This new model was designed to match the commonly used commercial fermentation systems, making the new technology readily available for many applications and studies. The author demonstrated the performance of the new model for human fecal sample incubation using the in-vitro technology developed in the first stage and validated its accuracy. Moreover, the author found that the contribution of newly introduced components in the mass-flow equation exceeded 9. 1 % of the overall gas profile. In the final stage, the author researched the monitoring capability of anaerobic digestion processes using in-situ measurements of gas components in both liquid and gas phases. As {{an integral part of the}} microbial activity of anaerobic digestion processes, gas components have the potential of providing the necessary information for monitoring such processes effectively. However, current technologies for gas sensing in liquid-phase have been inadequate. Previously, Real-time profiling of gas components in both phases simultaneously has not been thoroughly studied due to lack of the required technology. This has possibly hindered important insights about the system&rsquo;s health. In order to conduct this research, the author developed a novel, relatively simple, low-cost technique for measuring gas components in both phases simultaneously. Using this technique, dissolved gases were measured in-situ using membrane protected gas sensors which, in comparison to other approaches, eliminated many complications, delays or sample contamination. The author demonstrated the performances of the new technology on a series of anaerobic digestion batch experiments and confirmed its accuracy, longevity and reproducibly. Utilizing the new technique, the author identified patterns and signatures that were associated with process imbalances but not clearly observed in commonly used indicators such as volatile acids and pH. The author also explored the impact of inoculum age on the process and showed that, relative to freshly collected inoculum, processes using aged inoculum had a higher potential to enter imbalanced states and failure. It is the position of this author that the insights and technological advances achieved in this PhD research have contributed significantly to the advancement of the field of anaerobic fermentation. In particular, this was achieved by creating new, simple, accurate and reliable technologies, while adding significantly to the knowledge of quasi-closed, pressure regulated anaerobic fermentation systems and their applications...|$|E

40|$|Interactions between {{intestinal}} bacteria {{and the host}} {{play an important role}} in physiological regulation of gut function and in development of various diseases. Nitric oxide (NO) exhibits a variety of biological actions in the gut including regulation of regional blood flow, gut motility, water and electrolyte transport and immunity. In patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) the mucosal production of NO from NO synthases is greatly increased but its role in the pathophysiology of IBD is still unclear. Denitrifying bacteria in soil generate NO from nitrate (NO 3 -) and nitrite (NO 2 -) as a part of the nitrogen cycle. In this project we wanted to investigate whether the micro-organisms residing in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract could contribute to NO generation and under which conditions this would occur in vivo. We developed several new methods to directly measure gaseous NO in vivo in the colon of newborn infants and in the entire GI tract of conventional and germ-free animals. In addition, in in vitro experiments we investigated NO generation and consumption of NO by different gut bacteria. We started this project by monitoringthe initial bacterial colonization in newborn infants with repeated measurements of intracolonic hydrogen gas (H 2), fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and NO. These markers were virtually undetectable at birth but increased in a particular pattern - bacterial products (H 2 and SCFA) appeared first followed by NO some days later. Interestingly, in some apparently healthy infants colonic NO levels increased to levels similar to those seen in adults with inflammatory bowel disease, indicating a vivid activation of the immune system in response to the emerging bacterial flora. Next we investigated if bacteria could be an alternative source of gastrointestinal NO in addition to the mucosa. We found that in conventional rats, NO levels were distinctly compartmentalized with very high levels in the stomach, intermediate levels in the cecum and lower levels in the small intestine and colon. In contrast, in germ-free rats, NO was low throughout the gastrointestinal tract. When we fed rats nitrate, gastric NO increased greatly in conventional but not in germ-free animals, thereby confirming nitrate to be a substrate for bacterial NO generation. We went on to demonstrate that lactic acid producing bacteria (Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria) can generate considerable amounts of NO from nitrite in vitro. A combined mixed faecal flora was capable of NO generation not only from nitrite but also from nitrate. In the final study we demonstrate that intestinal NO generation can be stimulated in vivo by dietary supplementation with substrate (nitrate) and lactobacilli. Furthermore, in vitro studies show that the generation of NO by some probiotic bacteria can be counteracted by rapid NO consumption by other strains (E. coli and S. aureus). We conclude that commensal bacteria can be a significant source of NO in the gut in addition to the NO produced in the mucosa. NO generation by gut bacteria differ profoundly from classical mammalian synthesis via NO synthases as bacteria use nitrate and nitrite as substrates instead of L-arginine. Future studies will clarify the biological role of the bacteria-derived intestinal NO in health and disease and if an imbalance in generation vs consumption has any significance in the patho-physiology of intestinal disorders. Direct minimally-invasive measurements of <b>intestinal</b> <b>gases</b> including NO and H 2 may also be useful to study the dynamics of the microbial colonization process and host-microbial interactions early in life. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Authors: Yara Bernaldo de Quirós, Óscar González-Díaz, Manuel Arbelo, Marisa Andrada & Antonio Fernández ### Abstract Gas {{sampling}} in stranded {{marine mammals}} {{can now be}} performed in situ using the appropriate vacuum tubes, insulin syringes and an aspirometer. Glass vacuum tubes are used for extraction of gas from cavities such as the intestine, pterigoyd air sacs, pneumothorax or subcapsular emphysema {{as well as for}} storage of the gas sample at room temperature and pressure. Insulin syringes are used for extraction of bubbles found in veins, then immediately injecting its content into the vacuum tubes for storage. Finally an aspirometer is used to extract and separate the gas mixed with blood inside the heart. We have found that these are reliable tools for in situ gas sampling, storage and transportation without appreciable loss of gas and without compromising the accuracy of the analysis. Gas analysis is conducted by gas chromatography in the laboratory. ### Introduction Gas-bubble lesions have been described in cetaceans stranded in spatio-temporal concordance with military maneuvers (1, 2). These authors suggested decompression like sickness as an explanation for the observed lesions. Decompression sickness is the disease caused by bubble formation due to gas phase separation in the body. Gas phase may arise from supersaturated gas tissues after decompression when the sum of the dissolved gas tensions (oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, helium) and water vapor exceeds the local absolute pressure (3, 4). According to Bert (1878), the main gas “which would threaten life on being liberated would be exclusively the one the proportion of which was considerably increased in the blood”: nitrogen (5). Gas chromatography has been demonstrated as a valid method to discriminate putrefaction gases from air embolism (6, 7), and {{has been used as a}} forensic tool in humans for this purpose (8). Indeed putrefaction gas is one of the problems that we might face when dealing with stranded marine mammals. We describe the step by step protocol that has been experimentally tested and verified for the reliable and consistent collection, storage and analysis of gas from different body compartments in stranded cetaceans. Furthermore, we have demonstrated by using this protocol that gases in acute and chronic gas embolism-affected cetaceans that were minimally decomposed had high or very high nitrogen contents in bubbles (9). ### Equipment 1. 5 -mL additive-free vacutainer (BD Vacutainer® Z. ref: 367624), vacutainer holders and double-pointed needle with a rubber barrier on the tube puncture side (ref: 360214) - Disposable insulin syringes (BD Plastipak U- 100 insulin) - Aspirometer (U 201100896), tygon 2375 tubes, and an aspirator bottle with tubulation, 18 gauge needles. - Gas chromatograph equipped with a Varian CP 7430 column and two detectors disposed after each other: a thermal-conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame-ionization detector (FID). **Equipment set up** **Aspirometer set up**: A tygon tube of approximately 1 meter long must connect the aspirometer and the aspirator bottle. Another tygon tube of 50 cm should connect the aspirometer with the needle. At the top of the burette another needle must be placed. All joints have to be silicon and parafilm sealed. The whole system is filled with distilled water (Figure 1). **Gas chromatograph set up**: TCD temperature at 80 °C, filament temperature at 160 °C. The temperature for the FID is fixed at 230 °C. Samples are run for 25 minutes with an isothermal temperature of 45 °C and an electronically controlled flux with a fixed pressure of 13. 1 psi on the head column. Helium is used as the carrier gas. ### Procedure **Dissection** 1. Carefully remove the skin and blubber minimizing damage to the major subcutaneous veins. - Examine the visible and larger subcutaneous veins for bubbles. - Take photos of veins with bubbles. - Sample bubbles* 1. - **CRITICAL STEP**: If pneumothorax is suspected, gas sampling could be done by using the vacutainer®, inserting the double pointed needle in between the ribs* 2. Do not open thoracic cavity! - Open first the abdominal cavity carefully (try not to cut medium to large size vessels). - Examine the mesenteric and renal veins as well as the lumbo-caudal venous plexus for bubbles. - Take photos of bubbles within vessels. - Sample bubble’s content “_in situ_” using the insulin syringes* 1. - Look for subcapsular emphysema. - Sample the subcapsular (gas) emphysema in situ using the vacutainer®* 2. - Sample <b>intestinal</b> <b>gases</b> using the vacutainer* 2. Preferably take at least three samples from different locations. - Open thoracic cavity. If desired, ribs could be disarticulated except the first 3 or 4 cranial ones. These ribs should be cut at 1 / 3 from the vertebral articulation. - **CRITICAL STEP**: Avoid cutting large vessels - Cut the pericardial sac dorsolaterally (making a “window”) to have access to the pericardial veins, keeping the sac for filling up with water after first examination. - **CRITICAL STEP**: Avoid making the pericardial sac window too large. - Examine the coronary vessels through the window. - Take photos of vessels and bubbles. - Sample bubbles* 1. - Fill the pericardial sac with distilled water. - **CRITICAL STEP**: distilled water is used to prevent atmospheric air contamination. - Sample the gas from the heart (right and left ventricles) using the aspirometer* 3. - Sample the gas from the Aorta and the pulmonary trunk* 3. - Follow up with routine necropsy protocol. - **CRITICAL STEP**: do not cut any systemic vein or sample organs until this step is reached. - Separate the head from the body. - You might disarticulate the mandible to have a better access to the pteryoid sacs. - Sample pterygoid sacs using the vacutainer®* 2. - **CRITICAL STEP**: do not open the sinuses before gas sampling. **^ 1 Gas sampling from bubbles in veins** **CRITICAL STEP**: place the vein under water whenever possible to avoid atmospheric air contamination. 1. Sample each bubble with a new dispensable insulin syringe (BD Plastipak U- 100 insulin) - Inject the content immediately into a new vacutainer® each time. - Label the vacutainer® with volume recovered and location of the bubble. - **CRITICAL STEP**: Use one new syringe and one new vacutainer for each bubble. **^ 2 Gas sampling from cavities (intestine, pterigoyd air sacs) and gas associated lesions (pneumothorax and subcapsular emphysema) ** 1. Couple the vatuainer® plastic holder to the double pointed needle - Insert the needle into the cavity - Push the vacutainer® against the other end of the needle - Leave for a few seconds - Remove the vacutainer® - Remove the needle - **CRITICAL STEP**: If any of theses steps is not done following this sequence, atmospheric air contamination will occur. **^ 3 Gas sampling from the heart cavities using the aspirometer** 1. Fill up all the aspirometer system with distilled water, including the needle on the top of the burette. - Remove any bubbles found in the system. - **CRITICAL STEP**: If the system is not completely filled with distilled water or if there are bubbles, this air will contaminate your sample - Move up the aspirator bottle to a higher height than the aspirometer level and let water run out from the sampling needle (Figure 2). - Insert the sampling needle into the heart cavity. - Move down the aspirator bottle to a lower height than the aspirometer level. - Wait for blood alone or blood mixed with gas to be suctioned (Figure 3). - Once no more gas is suctioned, clamp the sampling tube. - Move the aspirator bottle to the same level as the aspirometer. (Gas will separate from the liquid and accumulate in the top of the burette) - To collect the gas, insert a vacutainer® in the needle at the top of the burette. - Open the stopcock. - Recover your sample. - Close the stopcock. - Remove the vacutainer®. - Repeat steps 10 - 13 as many times as necessary to collect all the gas. - Measure water temperature in the aspirator bottle. - **CRITICAL STEP**: If steps from 3 - 13 are not done carefully following this sequence, air contamination will occur. **Storage and transport** 1. Store the samples at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. - Store blank tubes with the samples; one blank per sample or a minimum of 3 blanks per animal. - If samples need to be transported in a plane, they should travel within the passenger cabin to prevent dramatic changes in atmospheric pressure that might alter the vacuum tubes. **Gas analyses and calculations** 1. Analyze a minimum of three blanks per animal. - Calculate the detection limit for your gases based on the blanks as follows: ![Equation]([URL] "Equation"), where S*min* is the minimum detectable signal, S*blank*, is the average signal for a given gas in the blanks, and S^ 2 *blank* is the associated standard deviation. - Correct for deviations if the aspirometer is used. ### Timing Time to collect samples varies depending on the presence or absence of bubbles, amount of bubbles and studied species. For a dolphin, maximum estimated sampling time is 30 minutes if the aspirometer is used. If it is not used, sampling should take less time. ### Troubleshooting The evacuated tubes contain some atmospheric air, which we correct from our samples using the detection limit. We strongly recommend the use of BD 5 ml additive-free vacutainer, because they contain low levels of atmospheric air and are made of break-resistant glass. If you don’t have this tube available, use the smallest glass evacuated tube you can find, and take many blanks with your samples to correct for the standard deviation. Evacuated tubes do not resist too changes in pressure very well. If tubes need to be transported in a plane they should go into the passenger cabin. If you need to ship them, you should use a pressure resistant housing. Very small bubbles, won’t give you signals higher than the detection limit. Sample the largest bubbles you find. Usually, bubbles larger than 0. 5 mL give goods results. ### Anticipated Results Gas embolism found in fresh animals might be composed of high or very high nitrogen, while gases produced by putrefaction might be composed of a mixture of nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon dioxide^ 9. ### References 1.

40|$|We {{have shown}} that a galactooligosaccharide {{prebiotic}} administration (HOST-G 904) initially increased <b>intestinal</b> <b>gas</b> production and this increase declined back to baseline after 2  week administration. Our aim {{was to determine the}} mechanism of microbiota adaptation; i. e., to determine whether the net reduction is due to decreased overall production or increased gas consumption. In 10 healthy subjects, <b>intestinal</b> <b>gas</b> production and intraluminal disposal was measured before, at the beginning and after 2  week of HOST-G 904 prebiotic administration. Anal gas was collected for 4 hour after a probe meal. Paired studies were performed without and with high-rate infusion of exogenous gas (24  mL/min) into the jejunum to wash-out the endogenous gas produced by bacterial fermentation. The exogenous gas infused was labeled (5 % SF 6) to calculate the proportion of endogenous gas evacuated. The volume of <b>intestinal</b> <b>gas</b> produced i. e., endogenous gas washed-out, increased by 37 % at the beginning of HOST-G 904 administration (P=. 049 vs preadministration) and decreased down to preadministration level after 2  week administration (P=. 030 vs early administration). The proportion of gas eliminated from the lumen before reaching the anus tended to increase after 2 -week administration (87 ± 3 % vs 78 ± 5 % preadministration; P=. 098). Adaptation to regular consumption of HOST-G 904 prebiotic involves a shift in microbiota metabolism toward low-gas producing pathways, with a non-significant increase in gas-consuming activity. Hence, regular consumption of HOST-G 904 regulates <b>intestinal</b> <b>gas</b> metabolism: less gas is produced and a somewhat larger proportion of it is consumed...|$|R
25|$|Normal flatus {{volume range}} is around 476 to 1,491nbsp&ml per 24 hours. This {{variability}} between individuals is greatly dependent upon diet. Similarly {{the number of}} flatus episodes per day is variable, the normal range is given as 8–20 per day. The volume of flatus associated with each flatulence event again varies (5–375nbsp&ml). The volume of the first flatulence upon waking in the morning is significantly larger than those during the day. This {{may be due to}} buildup of <b>intestinal</b> <b>gas</b> in the colon during sleep, the peak in peristaltic activity in the first few hours after waking or the strong prokinetic effect of rectal distension on the rate of transit of <b>intestinal</b> <b>gas.</b> It is now known that gas is moved along the gut independently of solids and liquids, and this transit is more efficient in the erect position compared to when supine. It is thought that large volumes of <b>intestinal</b> <b>gas</b> present low resistance, and can be propelled by subtle changes in gut tone, capacitance and proximal contraction and distal relaxation.

25|$|Flatus (<b>intestinal</b> <b>gas)</b> {{is mostly}} {{produced}} as {{a byproduct of}} bacterial fermentation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, especially the colon. There are reports of aerophagia (excessive air swallowing) causing excessive <b>intestinal</b> <b>gas,</b> but this is considered rare. Over 99% {{of the volume of}} flatus is composed of non-smelly gases. These include oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane. Nitrogen is not produced in the gut, but a component of environmental air. Patients who have excessive <b>intestinal</b> <b>gas</b> that is mostly composed of nitrogen have aerophagia. Hydrogen, carbon dioxide and methane are all produced in the gut and contribute 74% of the volume of flatus in normal subjects. Methane and hydrogen are flammable, and so flatus containing adequate amounts of these can be ignited. Not all humans produce flatus that contains methane. For example, in one study of the faeces of nine adults, only five of the samples contained archaea capable of producing methane. The prevalence of methane over hydrogen in human farts may correlate with obesity, constipation and irritable bowel syndrome, as archaea that oxidise hydrogen into methane promote the metabolism's ability to absorb fatty acids from food.|$|R
40|$|Vasopressin, {{a hormone}} {{secreted}} from the posterior lobe of the hypophysis, has endocrinological and antidiuretic effects; it contracts vessels and smooth muscles, especially intestinal smooth muscle. In the present study, we investigated {{the role of}} vasopressin (Pitressin: arginine-vasopressin) in elimination of <b>intestinal</b> <b>gas</b> on excretory urography reading. Sixty outpatients were randomly divided into six groups. In Group I, the routine procedure was employed, i. e. laxatives the previous night and NPO {{the morning of the}} examination. In Groups II to VI, different dose regimens were employed: 6 or 10 units of Pitressin was administered by subcutaneous injection 30 minutes prior to injection of a contrast medium, with or without NPO. <b>Intestinal</b> <b>gas</b> elimination was evaluated by X-ray films taken before and after injection of Pitressin. The efficacy was rated by four grades. There {{were no significant differences in}} the gas elimination or occurrence of side effects between any two groups. Younger patients seemed to respond quickly to Pitressin and good effects were obtained. These results indicate that the pretreatment for excretory urography with 6 units of Pitressin without NPO may be a safe and effective alternative method for elimination of <b>intestinal</b> <b>gas,</b> in particular for young patients...|$|R

40|$|Background: The precise {{relation}} of <b>intestinal</b> <b>gas</b> to symptoms, particularly abdominal bloating and distension remains incompletely elucidated. Our {{aim was to}} define the normal values of <b>intestinal</b> <b>gas</b> volume and distribution and to identify abnormalities in relation to functional-type symptoms. Methods:Abdominal computed tomography scans were evaluated in healthy subjects (n = 37) and in patients in three conditions: basal (when they were feeling well; n = 88), during an episode of abdominal distension (n = 82) and after a challenge diet (n = 24). <b>Intestinal</b> <b>gas</b> content and distribution were measured by an original analysis program. Identification of patients outside the normal range was performed by machine learning techniques (one-class classifier). Results are expressed as median (IQR) or mean ± SE, as appropriate. Key Results: In healthy subjects the gut contained 95 (71, 141) mL gas distributed along the entire lumen. No differences were detected between patients studied under asymptomatic basal conditions and healthy subjects. However, either during a spontaneous bloating episode or once challenged with a flatulogenic diet, luminal gas {{was found to be}} increased and/or abnormally distributed in about one-fourth of the patients. These patients detected outside the normal range by the classifier exhibited a significantly greater number of abnormal features than those within the normal range (3. 7 ± 0. 4 vs 0. 4 ± 0. 1; p < 0. 001). Conclusions & Inferences: The analysis of a large cohort of subjects using original techniques provides unique and heretofore unavailable information on the volume and distribution of <b>intestinal</b> <b>gas</b> in normal conditions and in relation to functional gastrointestinal symptoms.
