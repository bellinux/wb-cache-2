5|$|The ionic radii of the {{alkali metals}} are {{much smaller than}} their atomic radii. This is because the {{outermost}} electron of the alkali metals is in a different <b>electron</b> <b>shell</b> than the inner electrons, and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer <b>electron</b> <b>shell</b> and is smaller. Additionally, the effective nuclear charge has increased, and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases.|$|E

5|$|Large {{jumps in}} the {{successive}} molar ionization energies occur when removing an electron from a noble gas (complete <b>electron</b> <b>shell)</b> configuration. For magnesium again, {{the first two}} molar ionization energies of magnesium given above correspond to removing the two 3s electrons, and the third ionization energy is a much larger 7730kJ/mol, {{for the removal of}} a 2p electron from the very stable neon-like configuration of Mg2+. Similar jumps occur in the ionization energies of other third-row atoms.|$|E
5|$|Atomic radii vary in a {{predictable}} and explainable manner across the periodic table. For instance, the radii generally decrease along each {{period of the}} table, from the alkali metals to the noble gases; and increase down each group. The radius increases sharply between the noble gas {{at the end of}} each period and the alkali metal at the beginning of the next period. These trends of the atomic radii (and of various other chemical and physical properties of the elements) can be explained by the <b>electron</b> <b>shell</b> theory of the atom; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of quantum theory.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{predictions}} of the chemical properties of rutherfordium were based on calculations which indicated that the relativistic effects on the <b>electron</b> <b>shell</b> might be strong enough that the 7p orbitals would have a lower energy level than the 6d orbitals, giving it a valence electron configuration of 6d1 7s2 7p1 or even 7s2 7p2, therefore making the element behave more like lead than hafnium. With better calculation methods and experimental studies of the chemical properties of rutherfordium compounds it could be shown that this does not happen and that rutherfordium instead behaves {{like the rest of}} the group 4 elements.|$|E
5|$|At ambient conditions, {{berkelium}} assumes {{its most}} stable α form {{which has a}} hexagonal symmetry, space group P63/mmc, lattice parameters of 341pm and 1107pm. The crystal has a double-hexagonal close packing structure with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic (having a similar structure) with α-lanthanum and α-forms of actinides beyond curium. This crystal structure changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 7GPa, α-berkelium transforms to the beta modification, which has a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry and space group Fmm. This transition occurs without change in volume, but the enthalpy increases by 3.66 kJ/mol. Upon further compression to 25GPa, berkelium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-berkelium structure {{similar to that of}} α-uranium. This transition is accompanied by a 12% volume decrease and delocalization of the electrons at the 5f <b>electron</b> <b>shell.</b> No further phase transitions are observed up to 57 GPa.|$|E
5|$|In the {{standard}} periodic table, the elements {{are listed in}} order of increasing atomic number Z (the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom). A new row (period) is started when a new <b>electron</b> <b>shell</b> has its first electron. Columns (groups) {{are determined by the}} electron configuration of the atom; elements with the same number of electrons in a particular subshell fall into the same columns (e.g. oxygen and selenium are in the same column because they both have four electrons in the outermost p-subshell). Elements with similar chemical properties generally fall into the same group in the periodic table, although in the f-block, and to some respect in the d-block, the elements in the same period tend to have similar properties, as well. Thus, it is relatively easy to predict the chemical properties of an element if one knows the properties of the elements around it.|$|E

Atoms with full valence <b>electron</b> <b>shells</b> are extremely stable and therefore do not tend to form chemical bonds and have little tendency to gain or lose electrons.

5|$|The atomic radii of the {{alkali metals}} {{increase}} {{going down the}} group. Because of the shielding effect, when an atom {{has more than one}} <b>electron</b> <b>shell,</b> each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus. In the alkali metals, the outermost electron only feels a net charge of +1, as some of the nuclear charge (which is equal to the atomic number) is cancelled by the inner electrons; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge. Therefore, the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, the atomic radius must also increase down the group.|$|E
5|$|The {{actinide}} series derives {{its name from}} the first element in the series, actinium. The informal chemical symbol An is used in general discussions of actinide chemistry to refer to any actinide. All but one of the actinides are f-block elements, with the exception being either actinium or lawrencium. The series mostly corresponds to the filling of the 5f <b>electron</b> <b>shell,</b> although actinium and thorium lack any f-electrons, and curium and lawrencium have the same number as the preceding element. In comparison with the lanthanides, also mostly f-block elements, the actinides show much more variable valence. They all have very large atomic and ionic radii and exhibit an unusually large range of physical properties. While actinium and the late actinides (from americium onwards) behave similarly to the lanthanides, the elements thorium, protactinium, and uranium are much more similar to transition metals in their chemistry, with neptunium and plutonium occupying an intermediate position.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen's {{chemical}} properties {{are not very}} close {{to those of the}} alkali metals, which occupy group 1, and on that basis hydrogen is sometimes placed elsewhere: {{one of the most common}} alternatives is in group 17; one of the factors behind it is the strictly univalent predominantly non-metallic chemistry of hydrogen, and that of fluorine (the element placed on the top of group 17) is strictly univalent and non-metallic. Sometimes, to show how hydrogen has properties both corresponding to those of the alkali metals and the halogens, it may be shown in two columns simultaneously. Another suggestion is above carbon in group 14: placed that way, it fits well into the trends of increasing ionization potential values and electron affinity values, and is not too far from the electronegativity trend, even though hydrogen cannot show the tetravalence characteristic of the heavier group 14 elements. Finally, hydrogen is sometimes placed separately from any group; this is based on how general properties of hydrogen differ from that of any group. The other period 1 element, helium, is sometimes placed separately from any group as well. The property that distinguishes helium from the rest of the noble gases (even though the extraordinary inertness of helium is extremely close to that of neon and argon) is that in its closed <b>electron</b> <b>shell,</b> helium has only two electrons in the outermost electron orbital, while the rest of the noble gases have eight.|$|E

This process produces an emission spectrum of X-rays at a few discrete frequencies, sometimes referred to as the spectral lines. The spectral lines generated depend on the target (anode) element used and thus are called characteristic lines. Usually these are transitions from upper shells into K shell (called K lines), into L shell (called L lines) and so on.|$|E
25|$|Lewis {{proposed}} that an atom forms enough covalent bonds {{to form a}} full (or closed) outer <b>electron</b> <b>shell.</b> In the diagram of methane shown here, the carbon atom has a valence of four and is, therefore, surrounded by eight electrons (the octet rule), four from the carbon itself and four from the hydrogens bonded to it. Each hydrogen has a valence of one and is surrounded by two electrons (a duet rule) – its own one electron plus one from the carbon. The numbers of electrons correspond to full shells in the quantum theory of the atom; the outer shell of a carbon atom is the n=2 shell, which can hold eight electrons, whereas the outer (and only) shell of a hydrogen atom is the n=1 shell, which can hold only two.|$|E

500|$|Potassium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol K (from Neo-Latin [...] ) and atomic number19. It was first isolated from potash, {{the ashes of}} plants, from which its name derives.

All of the alkali metals have a single valence electron in the outer <b>electron</b> <b>shell,</b> which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge – a cation, which combines with anions to form salts. Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac-colored flame. [...] It is found dissolved in sea water (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and is part of many minerals.|$|E
500|$|The {{physical}} {{basis of}} the chemical periodicity governing the periodic table is the <b>electron</b> <b>shell</b> closures at each noble gas (atomic numbers 2, 10, 18, 36, 54, 86, and 118): as any further electrons must enter a new shell with higher energy, closed-shell electron configurations are markedly more stable, leading to the relative inertness of the noble gases. Since protons and neutrons are also known to arrange themselves in closed nuclear shells, the same effect happens at nucleon shell closures, which happen at specific nucleon numbers often dubbed [...] "magic numbers". The known magic numbers are 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, and 82 for protons and neutrons, and also 126 for neutrons. Nucleons with magic proton and neutron numbers, such as helium-4, oxygen-16, calcium-48, and lead-208, are termed [...] "doubly magic" [...] and are very stable against decay. This property of increased nuclear stability {{is very important for}} superheavy elements: without any stabilization, their half-lives would be expected by exponential extrapolation to be in the range of nanoseconds (10−9s) when element 110 (darmstadtium) is reached, because of the ever-increasing repulsive electromagnetic forces between the positively charged protons that overcome the limited-range strong nuclear force that holds the nucleus together. The next closed nucleon shells and hence magic numbers are thought to be at the centre of the long-sought island of stability, where the half-lives to alpha decay and spontaneous fission lengthen again.|$|E
