25|$|The {{right of}} entry into the EEA and Switzerland (includes all EU and EEA {{countries}} and Switzerland) without additional visa was extended to the third-country family members of EEA nationals exercising their treaty right of free movement who hold a valid residence card of their EEA host country and wish to visit any other EEA member state for a short stay up to 90 days. This is implied in Directive 2004/38/EC, Article 5(2) provided that they travel together with the <b>EEA</b> <b>national</b> or join their spouse/partner {{at a later date}} (Article 6(2)). If the non-EEA family member has neither an EEA residence card nor a visa, but can show their family tie with the EU national by other means, then a visa must be issued at the border free of charge and entry permitted.|$|E

It is based on Directive 2004/38/EC. It allows EEA citizens and their family members {{to live and work}} in the UK without explicit permission. Although Swiss citizens are covered by a separate bilateral agreement they are treated basically the same as <b>EEA</b> <b>nationals.</b> Family members may need a special entry clearance (the EEA family permit) to enter the UK.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, the Swiss {{voted to}} extend the free {{movement}} of people to Bulgaria and Romania by 59.6% in favour to 40.4% against. While the EU Directive 2004/38/EC {{on the right to}} move and reside freely does not directly apply to Switzerland, the Swiss-EU bilateral agreement on the free movement of people contains the same rights both for Swiss and <b>EEA</b> <b>nationals,</b> and their family members.|$|R
5000|$|A family permit will {{be issued}} if the {{applicant}} is the spouse, civil partner or dependent child of an <b>EEA</b> <b>national</b> {{and they will be}} travelling to the UK with that person. There are also requirements connected to the need for the EEA person, if staying for more than three months, to be economically active or to be a self-sufficient person (called [...] "exercising a treaty right") and for the family unit not to fall dependent upon public funds while in the United Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|EEA family {{permits are}} {{available}} from any entry clearance issuing post (most embassies and consulates) outside the UK, and are issued for six months at a time. A family member who wishes {{to stay in the}} UK for more than six months can apply for a residence card to formalise their right of abode (or for a family member residence stamp in the first 12 months where the <b>EEA</b> <b>national</b> family member is a national of a newly joined member state for which transitional restrictions on the freedom of movement of persons still apply).|$|E
5000|$|The {{definition}} of Core family member (of an <b>EEA</b> <b>national)</b> only includes {{a spouse or}} civil partner, children under 21, or dependant children of any age and dependent parents. A person outside of this definition (especially unmarried partners) may {{fall under the category}} extended family member. These include dependents of the EU citizens, members of the household, and a partner in a [...] "durable relationship". While the Directive 2004/38 requires member states to [...] "facilitate entry" [...] for extended family members, the details are not defined. The Directive does not seem to grant any rights to extended family members.|$|E
30|$|The {{previous}} discussion {{suggests that}} there was a relatively small {{reduction in the number of}} high-skilled RMW since 2011. This would suggest that while the UK Government policies may have had some effect on high-skilled migration, the impact was not substantial. But it is important to remember that these policy changes were directed at non-EEA migration. <b>EEA</b> <b>nationals</b> enjoy free movement to the UK and the UK Government cannot impose limitations on their migration.|$|R
30|$|The UK’s {{immigration}} control and preference for <b>EEA</b> <b>nationals</b> apply well to international students. Even though {{the country has}} made its first-rate higher education resources more accessible to international students from non-EEA countries, it decidedly insists on {{immigration control}} considering post-graduate status change. Combining a relatively high level openness and control in managing international student mobility, the UK’s strategy to recruit international students, in particular from non-EEA countries, is the least integrated into its skilled immigration plan compared to Canada and the US.|$|R
30|$|The {{possibilities}} {{mentioned above}} {{are not mutually}} exclusive. For instance, some employers may recruit more UK graduates and <b>EEA</b> <b>nationals.</b> As such, {{even if there is}} {{an increase in the number}} of EEA workers in response to a reduction in the number of non-EEA workers, it is not clear that the size of the balloon (i.e., size of the recent migrant workforce) will remain the same. The increase in EEA workers is likely to only partially compensate for the reductions in non-EEA workers.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{issue with}} the UK {{implementation}} of the Directive is that the UK has kept national immigration law (the [...] "Immigration Rules") separate from {{the implementation of the}} European law (the [...] "EEA Regulations"). While it is possible to switch from the UK law to the European law, this does reset the clock for acquiring permanent residence. The legal situation of extended family members during this switch is uncertain, because they have to conform to both laws. Switching from European law to UK law is possible only after the EEA citizen became settled in the UK. [...] The <b>EEA</b> <b>national</b> is considered settled when having attained permanent residence.|$|E
50|$|The {{right of}} entry into the EEA and Switzerland (includes all EU and EEA {{countries}} and Switzerland) without additional visa was extended to the third-country family members of EEA nationals exercising their treaty right of free movement who hold a valid residence card of their EEA host country and wish to visit any other EEA member state for a short stay up to 90 days. This is implied in Directive 2004/38/EC, Article 5(2) provided that they travel together with the <b>EEA</b> <b>national</b> or join their spouse/partner {{at a later date}} (Article 6(2)). If the non-EEA family member has neither an EEA residence card nor a visa, but can show their family tie with the EU national by other means, then a visa must be issued at the border free of charge and entry permitted.|$|E
50|$|There {{are further}} issues, {{but they have}} a {{comparatively}} small effect. The application forms (EEA1, EEA2, EEA3, EEA4, and VAF5) are overly complicated, ask for a good amount of unnecessary information, and ask for many more documents to be included than legally necessary under the directive. For example, the application for a residence card as the family member of an <b>EEA</b> <b>national</b> requires that the EEA national's employer stamps the application form and provides a letter confirming the EEA national's employment. Until March 2009 applications launched by family members from outside of the EEA are judged against the national immigration rules despite the ECJ's ruling in Metock case that the imposition of a requirement for prior lawful residence is unlawful under EU law. There are also issues for spouses that are separate but not yet divorced.|$|E

50|$|Workers {{from recent}} member states {{have the right}} to move to the UK, but their access to the labour market is limited. The details are defined in the Worker Registration Scheme (WRS).

The transitional WRS scheme became obsolete in 2011 when A8 national workers will have the same rights as all other <b>EEA</b> <b>nationals.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Family {{members of}} EEA {{nationals}} exercising Treaty rights in Ireland {{in accordance with}} EU Directive 2004/38/EC, who are not themselves EEA nationals, are required {{to apply for a}} [...] "Residence Card of a family member of a Union citizen", as described in Article 10 of the Directive. In Ireland, applications for the Residence Card, are made on form EU1 and sent to the EU Treaty Rights Section of the Department of Justice. Article 10(1) of the Directive requires that such applications are processed within six months of submission. Once processed, a letter is sent to the applicant, instructing him or her to visit their local Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), in order to receive their Residence Card. The Residence Card {{comes in the form of}} a [...] "Certificate of Registration" [...] like any other issued by the GNIB, however a crucial distinction is made in that [...] "Stamp 4 EUFam" [...] is printed as the stamp number. This serves to confirm that the holder is a family member of an <b>EEA</b> <b>national</b> who is resident in Ireland in accordance with Directive 2004/38/EC. The Residence Card is valid for five years.|$|E
50|$|The {{right is}} only exercisable by a {{qualifying}} individual or a qualifying body. A qualifying individual is either an <b>EEA</b> <b>national</b> or a national {{of a country}} which is defined in Schedule 2 to the order creating the right. A qualifying body is a charity within the United Kingdom or a charity which is based with the EEA or a country defined in Schedule 2 to the order. The right only covers original works or those works where {{a limited number of}} copies have been made {{under the direction of the}} author. A sale is only regarded as a resale if the price of the work being sold is greater than 1,000 and either the seller or buyer is acting in the capacity of a professional art dealer. There is a saving provision which allows for works purchased directly from the author for under 10,000 within the last three years to not fall under the resale right. The seller is jointly liable to pay the royalty with a relevant person. The relevant person is defined as one or more of the agent of the seller, the agent of the buyer or the buyer where no agents exist. The relevant person must be a professional art dealer in order to be liable to pay the royalty. The holder of resale right on an artistic work has the right to obtain information to enable the payment of the royalty from any professional art dealers involved in the transaction when that request is made within three years of the transaction taking place. Where a sale takes place before 2010 only living authors are eligible for the royalty.|$|E

30|$|Restricting {{the access}} of non-EEA {{nationals}} to UK labor markets {{could be seen}} as a way of encouraging the recruitment of British workers on the part of employers. While it is likely that some of this recruitment occurs in practice, high-skilled work often involves a lengthy training period and the supply of high-skilled British workers is unlikely to increase much in the short-run (i.e., inelastic supply of high skilled labor in the short-run). The unmet demand for high-skilled workers may lead to more recruitment from the bigger pool of <b>EEA</b> high-skilled <b>nationals,</b> many of whom are ready to take on the new positions on a short notice. A third possibility would be for employers to adjust to the shortage of high-skilled workers. For instance, employers could up-skill current workers or change the production process to make less use of high skilled labor (Ruhs and Anderson 2010). This response would not increase the demand for high skilled <b>EEA</b> <b>nationals.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{immigration}} and nationality purposes it is UK law, and not Guernsey law, which applies (technically the Immigration Act 1971, extended to Guernsey by Order-in-Council). Guernsey may not apply different immigration controls to the UK. <b>EEA</b> <b>nationals</b> have free movement rights to enter, and remain in, {{the territory of}} the whole of the British Islands (which includes the jurisdiction of Guernsey), although there are de facto restrictions on occupation of housing by those who do not 'belong' to Guernsey (and that restriction includes people from Sark, until they have lived there for a number of years).|$|R
30|$|Everyone {{entering}} {{or leaving}} the UK for twelve {{months or more}} counts towards that target, including British and other European Economic Area (<b>EEA)</b> <b>nationals</b> whose entry and exit the UK Government cannot restrict. Given the limitations for restricting EEA migration, the UK Government’s efforts to reduce net migration are built around the restriction of inflows of non-EEA nationals and efforts to boost outflows of non-EEA nationals. These policies are likely to affect the size and composition of the UK migrant workforce and, in particular, the high-skilled migrant workforce. There is no route for low skilled labor migration to the UK from outside of the EEA. As such, the UK Government has restricted and closed routes intended for skilled non-EEA workers {{in order to reduce}} net migration.|$|R

30|$|Not surprisingly, the UK {{intends to}} take more {{effective}} measures through the new PBS to facilitate the entry of genuine students who have a clear intention to leave upon graduation while guarding against the risk of bogus {{students who do not}} fit the goal. The policy provisions put in place by the British government to ease the entry of overseas students from non-EEA countries are indeed preconditioned by temporary residency and a non-settlement regime with a clear goal of protecting UK and European labour markets. Thus, the open doors to non-EEA students, stricter control on their post-graduate status change, and the priority given to <b>EEA</b> <b>nationals</b> as a pool of skilled labour coexist as three interrelated facets of the UK’s strategy to manage international student mobility.|$|R

50|$|The SIA {{now works}} with the UK Border Agency (UKBA) to check the right to work of all SIA licence {{applicants}} who are non-EEA <b>nationals</b> (<b>EEA</b> <b>nationals</b> automatically {{have a right to}} work in the UK). It also checks the right to work of SIA licence holders from outside the EEA (i.e. individuals who have met its licensing criteria and have been granted a licence). Where the recorded right to work of a licence holder expires before their SIA licence, a further check is undertaken with the UKBA and, if the results of that check suggest that the individual's right to work has expired, the SIA will revoke their licence. These checks do not in any way replace the legal responsibility of an employer to check the right to work of its employees.|$|R
30|$|This finding has {{important}} implications for migration policymaking within an area of free movement of labor, such as the EEA. In this case migration involves elements over which the government has varying levels of influence. When it comes to migration of non-EEA nationals, the government has a considerable degree of control. But the government cannot control the immigration and emigration of <b>EEA</b> <b>nationals.</b> As such, efforts directed at reducing the migration from those groups that the government can control may lead to increases in those groups that the government cannot control (i.e., ‘balloon effect’). This paper does not prove beyond any doubt that the effect is the consequence of the recent UK Government policies, but it shows that this is a possibility that is consistent with the data and worthy of further investigation and consideration by policymakers.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} long-term international migration to the UK; we explore {{the extent to which}} migration is driven by macroeconomic variables (GDP per capita, unemployment rate) as well as law and policy (the existence of "free movement" rights for <b>EEA</b> <b>nationals).</b> We find a very large impact from free movement within the EEA. We also find that macroeconomic variables 2 ̆ 013 UK GDP growth and GDP at origin 2 ̆ 013 are significant drivers of migration flows; evidence for the impact of the unemployment rate in countries of origin, or of the exchange rate, however, is weak. We conclude that, while future migration flows will be driven by a number of factors, macroeconomic and otherwise, Brexit and the end of free movement will result in a large fall in immigration from EEA countries to the UK...|$|R
