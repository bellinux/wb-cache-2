Conversely, {{because of the}} <b>grandfathering</b> of licenses, several municipalities have a substantially higher ratio of licenses. For instance, the resort town of Wildwood has a permanent population of 5,300, but 61 active liquor licenses.|$|E
25|$|In Coase's {{model of}} social costs, either choice (<b>grandfathering</b> or auctioning) leads to efficiency. In reality, <b>grandfathering</b> subsidizes polluters, meaning that polluting {{industries}} may {{be kept in}} business longer than would otherwise occur. <b>Grandfathering</b> may also reduce the rate of technological improvement towards less polluting technologies (Fisher et al.., 1996, p.417).|$|E

Magnetic Signal was sold to the Griswold Signal Company of Minneapolis shortly after WWII. Production of new signals continued until 1949, and replacement parts until 1960.|$|E

500|$|Tradable {{emissions}} permits can {{be issued}} to firms within an ETS by two main ways: by free allocation of permits to existing emitters or by auction. Allocating permits based on past emissions is called [...] "grandfathering" [...] (Goldemberg et al.., 1996, p.38). <b>Grandfathering</b> permits, just like the other option of selling (auctioning) permits, sets a price on emissions. This gives permit-liable polluters an incentive to reduce their emissions. However, <b>grandfathering</b> permits can lead to perverse incentives, e.g., a firm that aimed to cut emissions drastically would then be given fewer permits in the future. Allocation may also slow down technological development towards less polluting technologies. The Garnaut Climate Change Review noted that 'grandfathered' permits are not 'free'. As the permits are scarce they have value and the benefit of that value is acquired in full by the emitter. The cost is imposed elsewhere in the economy, typically on consumers who cannot pass on the costs. However, profit-maximising firms receiving free permits will raise prices to customers because of the new, non-zero cost of emissions.|$|E

2500|$|A {{question}} has been raised over the <b>grandfathering</b> of allowances. Countries within the EU ETS have granted their incumbent businesses {{most or all of}} their allowances for free. This can sometimes be perceived as a protectionist obstacle to new entrants into their markets. There have also been accusations of power generators getting a 'windfall' profit by passing on these emissions 'charges' to their customers. As the EU ETS moves into its second phase and joins up with Kyoto, it seems likely that these problems will be reduced as more allowances will be auctioned.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the history}} of every profession, there is {{a period in which}} a diverse group of {{practitioners}} work in various ways to [...] "consolidate authority". [...] For medicine, this period is best known for the Flexner Report (1910) that rated medical schools and gave a major boost to the AMA leadership and elite physicians who were trying to upgrade and standardize medical education. [...] Educational standards for admission into the profession went along with earlier reorganization of the professional association—the AMA—to incorporate all practicing physicians (<b>grandfathering</b> in those who did not meet current standards), and a previous growth in state licensing that provided the legal authority for professional practice. [...] For some professions consolidation never happens: [...] nursing has spent a century debating educational standards, divided in identity, torn between being a labor force and a profession. [...] In 1984, former Congressman (FL) Paul Rogers noted in his introductory essay to a volume on Advocacy in Health Care, [...] "Advocacy in health care is a calling many of us have pursued—one way or another—for many years.
