30|$|The {{labor market}} {{response}} to reduced public sector hiring {{in both countries}} – informalization {{in the case of}} Egypt and the growth of formal but precarious temporary jobs in the private sector in Jordan – describes quite well how male <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> have responded in the two countries. The main response among women in both instances has been high unemployment rates at first and then withdrawal from the labor force altogether and falling participation rates, an issue we discuss in more detail below. Informal employment simply poses too high a reputational risk and too much conflict with their eventual roles as wives and mothers for most <b>female</b> <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> in conservative Middle Eastern societies to constitute an acceptable alternative to public sector employment (See Assaad, Hendy and Yassine 2014).|$|R

30|$|I {{argue in}} this paper that the longstanding {{practice}} of providing public sector employment at higher than market-clearing compensation {{as a tool of}} political appeasement has not only led to the misallocation of human capital in Arab economies, but also to the wrong kinds of human capital investments, and inefficient queuing by educated workers for government jobs. The consequences of these disastrous policies persist well after the policies themselves have been suspended and continue to shape labor markets in the long term. They include the large overhang of excess employment in the public sector, the existence of large stocks of inappropriate human capital, one of the longest lived assets in the economy, continued institutional distortions in education systems, which continue to be oriented toward credentialism rather than skill formation, and distorted expectations among young <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> that lead to queuing for public sector jobs and high youth unemployment. <b>Female</b> <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> are more affected by this kind of labor market dualism because of the more limited opportunities they face in the private sector, the bigger wedge they face between their market clearing wage and their potential compensation in the public sector, and their reluctance to take up informal employment that could threaten their sexual and reputational safety. As such they face higher unemployment rates and, more recently, increasing discouragement from participating in the workforce altogether.|$|R
40|$|Compared {{to older}} women, young <b>female</b> <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> {{are more than}} three times as likely to report that their ability to find a good new job is {{compromised}} by the simple fact that they are female. Why is this? In this paper we show, first, that young women’s more frequent reports of gender-induced harm cannot be statistically attributed to any observed personal or job characteristics, or to any “objective ” measure of discrimination computable in our data. Second, using new questions asked in a Canadian survey, we note that women’s reports of gender-induced advantage, as well as men’s reports of gender-induced harm, are also more prevalent among the young. Using a formal model of the reporting decision, we conclude that the most likely cause of all these phenomena is a particular kind of age difference in reporting behavior: young people of both sexes are more likely than older people to interpret departures in either direction from gender-neutral treatment as causally affected by their gender. This may have important implications for future public support of antidiscrimination policies, and for the design of those policies.

40|$|Background: Although {{the health}} {{sciences}} have been observing {{the negative impact}} of mass unemployment on health for some time now, health reporting remains fragmentary. Methods: The 2005 microcensus was conducted as an official random sample survey. A total of 380, 000 households, comprising 820, 000 individuals, took part. Providing health information was optional, with a response ratio of about 85 %. The Scientific Use File contains a 70 % subsample of the data set. Results: As of the survey date, average annual illness rates for 2005 were 6. 5 % among unemployed and 26. 6 % among inactive persons seeking to work (not available). If unemployed and inactive persons seeking to work were pooled into the single group of "job seekers", their average annual illness rate was 8. 8 %. This was significantly higher than for employed individuals, whose rate was 4. 4 %. However, the age-standardised odds ratios decreased from 2. 2 to 1. 8 for <b>female</b> <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> and from 2. 2 to 1. 6 for male <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics, family type, household structure, education, vocational training, socioeconomic variables, disabilities, smoking status, and other factors. The children of <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> who are the principal income earners were more than proportionally ill at the survey date, too. In multivariate model calculations, among persons who had been unemployed a year before, an illness lasting more than 12 months had the strongest impact on chances for present employment. Chances for reintegration were likewise substantially lower for persons with a disability. Conclusion: The microcensus analyses confirm the multifarious interactions between health and occupational status. Unemployment constitutes a present challenge for public health...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Sociology, Washington State UniversityA {{growing body}} of {{literature}} identifies social network contacts as playing an integral part in linking <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> with <b>jobs.</b> Most {{research in this area}} focuses on people after they have found work with the help of their contacts. Scholars are increasingly recognizing this approach is problematic because it cannot reveal anything about <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> who are unable to find work with the help of their contacts or the reasons they are unsuccessful. To address these problems, I study social network contact use, but from the perspective of contacts rather than <b>job</b> <b>seekers.</b> I use survey data I collected from a random sample of 577 Washington state adults, most of whom were recently asked to provide help with someone's job search. In the first analysis, I examine the factors that affect whether contacts help <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> with their search and whether <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> receive employment offers as a result of social networking. I find that contacts' resources, the strength of the relationship between contacts and <b>job</b> <b>seekers,</b> and <b>job</b> seekers' characteristics affect both outcomes. In the second analysis, I concentrate on homophily between contacts and <b>job</b> <b>seekers.</b> I find {{that the vast majority of}} <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> turn to same sex or race contacts for help with their job search, but not similarly aged or educated contacts. Analyses show that the effect of homophily on contacts' provision of help and job seekers' receipt of an offer are complex and inconsistent. The third part of my dissertation examines how contacts' residence in either an urban or rural community affects their likelihood of providing help with a job search. I find that geographic context matters; <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> who ask rural contacts for help with their job search are less successful than <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> who rely on urban contacts. By differentiating between <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> who successfully and unsuccessfully use social network contacts for their job searches, my dissertation offers new empirical evidence that can help scholars identify the mechanisms whereby social network use in the job attainment process works and labor market inequality is perpetuated.

They also examine the effect of a <b>job</b> <b>seeker’s</b> network on important job search out-comes, including occupational status and salary following reemployment. Results reveal the subsequent emergence of distinct networking strategies and outcomes dependent on industry growth. <b>Job</b> <b>seekers</b> displaced from growing industries tend to focus their search on the inclusion of weak ties. Their counterparts, displaced from declining industries, indicate the tendency to connect with strong ties. However, <b>job</b> <b>seekers</b> in declining industries who made the more diffi-cult connections with weakly tied contacts reaped important benefits in terms of salary following reemployment.
