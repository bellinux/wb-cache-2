40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to {{estimate}} {{the market value of}} a single <b>family</b> <b>house</b> in the municipality of Postojna on the basis of various types of data, namely on the basis of advertised prices of single <b>family</b> <b>houses,</b> selling prices of single <b>family</b> <b>houses</b> and single <b>family</b> <b>houses</b> with the ascribed generalized market value used with the method of comparison, on the basis of selling prices of building land which does not have a connection to public utilities, expenses for the building land development fee and expenses {{for the construction of a}} new single <b>family</b> <b>house</b> used with the method of expenses. The estimated market value of a single <b>family</b> <b>house</b> refers to a hypothetical single <b>family</b> <b>house</b> with the characteristics of the average or the median of the discussed single <b>family</b> <b>houses</b> in the municipality of Postojna. It has been established that by using the method of comparison the estimated market values of a hypothetical single <b>family</b> <b>house</b> are by 35 % higher for the sample of advertised single <b>family</b> <b>houses</b> and for the sample of sold single <b>family</b> <b>houses</b> by 21 % higher than the estimated market value by using the method of expenses. This means that it is worth investing in the construction of a single <b>family</b> <b>house</b> in the municipality of Postojna which does not hold good for the town of Postojna itself. Different estimated market values of a single <b>family</b> <b>house</b> being estimated are conditioned by different input data that is why appropriate adjustment factors should be applied in the use of certain data and methods in times of recession...|$|R
