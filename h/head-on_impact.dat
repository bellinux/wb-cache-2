40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} {{numerical}} simulations aimed at reproducing the Baptistina family {{based on its}} properties estimated by observations. A previous study by Bottke et al. (2007) indicated that this family is probably at {{the origin of the}} K/T impactor, is linked to the CM meteorites and was produced by the disruption of a parent body 170 km in size due to the <b>head-on</b> <b>impact</b> of a projectile 60 km in size at 3 km s- 1. This estimate was based on simulations of fragmentation of non-porous materials, while the family was assumed to be of C taxonomic type, which is generally interpreted as being formed from a porous body. Using both a model of fragmentation of non-porous materials, and a model that we developed recently for porous ones, we performed numerical simulations of disruptions aimed at reproducing this family and at analyzing the differences in the outcome between those two models. Our results show that a reasonable match to the estimated size distribution of the real family is produced from the disruption of a porous parent body by the <b>head-on</b> <b>impact</b> of a projectile 54 km in size at 3 km s- 1. Thus, our simulations with a model consistent with the assumed dark type of the family requires a smaller projectile than previously estimated, but the difference remains small enough to not affect the proposed scenario of this family history. We then find that the break-up of a porous body leads to different outcomes than the disruption of a non-porous one. The real properties of the Baptistina family still contain large uncertainties, and it remains possible that its formation did not involve the proposed impact conditions. However, the simulations presented here already show some range of outcomes and once the real properties are better constrained, it will be easy to check whether one of them provides a good match...|$|E
30|$|The {{estimated}} velocities of Ophir Labes (Fig.  5) {{are even}} higher, {{partly because the}} mounds, where the velocities are computed, are closer to the scarp. The tremendous impact with the nearest mound (position F in Fig.  5) at a speed of more than 118  m/s has truncated the landslide in two parts; the central portion has continued traveling to the next mound at a speed of 110 – 120  m/s, finally coming to rest on its top (position H). The OL-C mass did not rise much up the western mound in G. The {{reason may be that}} the landslide, after having been curved by the impact, flowed nearly parallel to the 300 -m-high barrier. As a consequence, the maximum run-up height was diminished by two orders of magnitude compared to <b>head-on</b> <b>impact</b> assuming an angle of about 10 °.

40|$|AbstractThe Safe System vision (known as Vision Zero, or Sustainable Safety in Europe) {{aspires to}} {{minimise}} death and serious injury as {{an outcome of}} road travel for all road users. The road engineering contribution to this vision focusses on impact elimination, or where this is not possible, on limiting kinetic energy passed to a road user {{in case of an}} impact. Impact kinetic energy is typically limited through vehicle speed management (e. g. speed limits, enforcement or geometric road design), as vehicle mass is difficult to effectively control by public road agencies. This paper reviews available international research on relationships between impact velocity change (delta-v), impact speeds and the probability of fatal and serious injury (MAIS 3 +) across a range of common crash scenarios. Based on the best identified relationships, and with assumption of equal mass and vehicle speeds, right [...] angle and <b>head-on</b> <b>impact</b> speeds of approximately 30 km/h are likely to produce MASI 3 + injury probability of approximately 10 %, considered a critical threshold in Safe System discussions. For pedestrians, the threshold is likely to be even lower, approximately 20 km/h. In rear-end crashes, the critical impact speed was found to be approximately 55 km/h. Some practical applications of these findings are discussed.

A model was developed to examine the effect of different football helmet designs on energy dissipation and injury mitigation during <b>head-on</b> <b>impacts</b> which approach, but do not exceed, critical cervical spinal cord injury threshold levels. Based upon the simulations, increasing in neck damping provides for significant reductions in peak cervical spinal loads. Helmet damping has a negligible effect on air cell helmet performance, but has a significant, deleterious impact on padded cell helmet performance. Moreover, cervical spinal loads are highly sensitive to player weight distribution and player initial velocity since these variables determine the amount of initial kinetic energy which must be absorbed by the helmet, head and neck system. Finally, a novel football helmet energy absorption curve has been developed which limits cervical spinal loads to approximately 800 lbf. through barometrically-controlled pressure relief valves up to player initial velocities of 30 ft/sec. Conclusions based primarily upon the results of the velocity and helmet damping analyses show that different football helmet energy absorption mechanisms can make a substantial, quantifiable difference in cervical spinal loads during low to moderate player velocity impacts at threshold energy levels...|$|R

A total of 43 ice impact events were recorded during the trials, most of which involved secondyear and multi-year floes. Impact speeds ranged from 2 to 16 kt. Since the objective of the October 2000 Trials was to examine propeller-ice interaction, data from the MOTAN sensor, which was installed near the ship 8 ̆ 217 s centre of gravity, were used to compute the whole-ship motions at the ship 8 ̆ 217 s centre propeller, in the stern. During the 43 events, maximum accelerations in heave, sway and surge were 1. 1 m/s 2, 1. 9 m/s 2 and 1. 0 m/s 2 respectively, at the centre propeller.

40|$|All {{planetary}} {{bodies with}} old surfaces exhibit planetary-scale impact craters: vast scars {{caused by the}} large impacts {{at the end of}} Solar System accretion or the late heavy bombardment. Here we investigate the geophysical consequences of planetary-scale impacts into a Mars-like planet, by simulating the events using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model. Our simulations probe impact energies over two orders of magnitude (2 × 10 ^(27) – 6 × 10 ^(29) J), impact velocities from the planet’s escape velocity to twice Mars’ orbital velocity (6 – 50 km/s), and <b>impact</b> angles from <b>head-on</b> to highly oblique (0 – 75 °). The simulation results confirm that for planetary-scale impacts, surface curvature, radial gravity, the large relative size of the impactor to the planet, and the greater penetration of the impactor, contribute to significant differences in the geophysical expression compared to small craters, which can effectively be treated as acting in a half-space. The results show that the excavated crustal cavity size and the total melt production scale similarly for both small and planetary-scale impacts as a function of impact energy. However, in planetary-scale impacts a significant fraction of the melt is sequestered at depth and thus does not contribute to resetting the planetary surface; complete surface resetting is likely only in the most energetic (6 × 10 ^(29) J), slow, and <b>head-on</b> <b>impacts</b> simulated. A crater rim is not present for planetary-scale impacts with energies > 10 ^(29) J and angles ≤ 45 °, but rather the ejecta is more uniformly distributed over the planetary surface. Antipodal crustal removal and melting is present for energetic (> 10 ^(29) J), fast (> 6 km/s), and low angle (≤ 45 °) impacts. The most massive impactors (with both high impact energy and low velocity) contribute sufficient angular momentum to increase the rotation period of the Mars-sized target to about a day. Impact velocities of > 20 km/s result in net mass erosion from the target, for all simulated energies and angles.

These models use analytical techniques to predict the crushing force versus axial crush distance characteristics of both a rigid-plastic, hemispherical shell and an elastic, cylindrical shell loaded axially by a rigid flat plate. Additional methods are proposed {{to determine the effects}} of cutout sections and internal stiffening members on the crushing force capacity of the shells. These proposed methods are applied to determine the energy absorption capability of the composite/metal nose structure of a mini submarine subjected to a <b>head-on</b> <b>impact</b> with a flat rigid wall.

Laminated plate theory, a progressive composite failure method, and the models developed are then used to determine the structure's energy absorption capacity.

40|$|The {{splashing}} of a {{water drop}} is a fascinating phenomenon that results {{from a variety of}} complex interactions between the drop and the material it impacts. In general, the distribution of droplets of a splash depends on the drop size and velocity; the surface roughness, rigidity, and wetness; and the angle of impact. Given the number of factors involved, it is difficult to develop an analytical model for the splash distribution. Instead, we take an empirical approach. We have measured the splashing behaviors of 22 different materials that are commonly found in the real world. These materials can be broadly classified as rough (e. g., wood and brick), smooth (e. g., marble and glass), flexible (e. g., silk and paper), and miscellaneous (e. g., water and moss). We have developed a stochastic model for splash distribution that builds upon empirical models previously developed in fluid dynamics and meteorology. Our model is simple and only requires 7 coefficients for generating splashes for <b>head-on</b> <b>impact</b> for a material. A more general model for generating splashes for arbitrary impact angles (due to surface inclination or wind) requires 54 coefficients. The models of different materials may be combined to generate physically plausible splashes for novel materials that have not been measured.

40|$|In {{the current}} paper, the authors present an {{analysis}} of the structural characteristics of an intermediate rail vehicle and their effects on crash performance of the vehicle. Theirs is a simulation based analysis involving four stages. First, the crashworthiness of the vehicle is assessed by simulating an impact of the vehicle with a rigid wall. Second, the structural characteristics of the vehicle are analysed based on the structural behaviour during this impact and then the structure is modified. Third, the modified vehicle is tested again in the same impact scenario with a rigid wall. Finally, the modified vehicle is subjected to a modelled <b>head-on</b> <b>impact</b> which mirrors the real-life impact interface between two intermediate vehicles in a train impact. The emphasis of the current study is on the structural characteristics of the intermediate vehicle and the differences compared to an impact of a leading vehicle. The study shows that, similar to a leading vehicle, bending, or jackknifing is a main form of failure in this conventionally designed intermediate vehicle. It has also been found that the location of the door openings creates a major difference in the behaviour of an intermediate vehicle. It causes instability of the vehicle in the door area and leads to high stresses at the joint of the end beam with the solebar and shear stresses at the joint of the inner pillar with the cantrail. Apart from this, the shapes of the vehicle ends and impact interfaces are also different and {{have an effect on the}} crash performance of the vehicles. The simulation results allow the identification of the structural characteristics and show the effectiveness of relevant modifications.

40|$|Accidents {{involving}} {{passenger trains}} happen regularly in India. The reasons for such accidents could be many; such as weather and flooding, faulty tracks, bridge collapse, collisions caused by signaling errors, mechanical failures, driver error, sabotage etc. The annual accident-related deaths {{as a percentage}} of the total number of passengers carried by Indian Railway may seem to be negligible, but the aim should be to achieve zero fatality as every single person killed is an irreplaceable loss to his/her family. It needs to be mentioned that in addition to fatalities for which exact numbers are not available, serious injuries and permanent disabilities caused by train accidents in India at present stand completely unaccounted for. In the absence of a large scale renovation and crash avoidance measures coupled with the propensity to increase the number of trains every year, enhancing passive safety is crucial i. e. crashworthiness and occupant safety of passenger coaches of Indian trains. In the current work, crashworthiness and occupant safety of the existing typical three-tier cabin passenger coach of Indian Railway in an event of collision accident are assessed with the aid of a finite element analysis. In the light of the published work on research in railroad equipment crashworthiness, the current work is intended to envisage the methodology to assess the Indian Railway passenger coach from the point of view of the crashworthiness and occupant safety using CAE (Computer aided engineering) based approach. It is involved with an extensive study of the structural crush behavior of an individual passenger coach car and its effect on the interaction between occupants and the coach interior. Here the structural crush behavior of a typical three-tier cabin passenger coach is evaluated for the <b>head-on</b> <b>impact</b> against a fixed and rigid barrier. The occupant response for the same scenario is also studied which can be viewed as a component of the actual occupant response due to the structural crush behavior of the passenger coach. This can give useful estimates of injury severity and fatalities that may occur in actual accidents. An FE model of the passenger coach structure was built and validated using International Railway Union (UIC) specified code OR 567 -design requirements in terms of static loads constituting structural proof cases. These proof cases specify the static load values the coach body structure should withstand without any permanent deformation or failure when applied at the specified locations on the structural ends across the longitudinal axis. In addition, a favorable correlation between the simulation and actual experiment for drop impact behavior of the open section specimens, namely C-section and I-section, was obtained to validate the simulation methodology. LS-DYNA a nonlinear dynamic explicit FE solver was used to carry out all the dynamic impact simulations involved in the current work. The material modeling takes into account the strain rate effect which is essential for the material impact behavior study. The contact modeling was done using penalty contact method. The degrading effect of the buffer on the structural crush patterns which induced the undesirable global bending and jackknifing of the whole coach structure was demonstrated with the help of dynamic impact simulations of the coach structure. The quantification of occupant injury was done by occupant safety simulations using the Hybrid III 50 th percentile male dummy FE model. The dummy having been designed for simulating automobile accident scenarios, its contacts had to be adapted to suit the excessive mobility conditions in the coach interior. The dummy was revalidated successfully for the head drop test, pendulum chest impact test, neck flexion and extension test and knee impact test. Impact simulations for three different speeds were performed by positioning the dummy close to the impact point. Injury criteria such as Head Injury Criterion, Chest Deceleration, Knee force level and Neck extension-flexion moments were used to estimate the injury severity level and fatality rate...|$|E

Hawthorn won the 1955 les 24 Heures du Mans following what {{has been described as}} an inspired drive in which he set a lap record of 122.388 mph during a three-hour duel with Fangio in the early stages. The race was marred by the worst disaster in motor racing history - a crash which killed 84 spectators and driver Pierre Levegh, after Hawthorn had suddenly braked in front of Lance Macklin's Healey after overtaking him to enter the pits, causing Macklin to swerve into the path of Levegh's Mercedes. After colliding with the Healey, the Mercedes skipped the earthen embankment separating the spectator area from the track, bounced through spectator enclosures, then hit a concrete stairwell structure <b>head-on.</b> The <b>impact</b> shattered {{the front end of the}} car, which then somersaulted high, pitching debris into the spectator area, before landing atop the earthen embankment. The debris, including bonnet, engine, and front axle, which separated from the frame, flew through the crowd. Eight hours later, while leading the race 1.5 laps ahead of the Jaguar team, the Mercedes team withdrew from the race, ostensibly as a mark of respect for those who had perished in the accident; the Jaguar team was invited to join them but declined. The French press carried photographs of Hawthorn and Ivor Bueb celebrating their win with the customary champagne but treated them with scorn. The official inquiry into the accident ruled that Hawthorn was not responsible for the crash, and that it was merely a racing incident. The death of the spectators was blamed on inadequate safety standards for track design. The Grandstand and pit areas were demolished and rebuilt soon after. The death toll led to a ban on motorsports in France, Spain, Switzerland, Germany and other nations, until the tracks could be brought to a higher safety standard.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the studies {{carried out by}} the author on two aspects of the crashworthiness of rail vehicles : (1) The behaviour of rakes of vehicles during collisions; (2) Interior crashworthiness for occupants (passengers) during secondary collisions. The investigation of the behaviour of vehicles in rakes aims to study how the initial kinetic energy is partitioned amongst the vehicles after <b>impact.</b> <b>Head-on</b> collisions between two rakes of up to seven coaches were simulated using two non-linear Finite Element codes. The model, which correlates well with British Rail's full scale test results, assumes that a rake of coaches may be represented by a series of masses connected by non-linear springs. Important parameters that governed the rake behaviour have been identified. The effects of inter-vehicular distances, velocity-sensitive couplers, number of coaches, initial impact velocities and spring characteristics (e. g. constant collapse force, softening, hardening etc.) on energy distribution along colliding rakes have been studied and discussed. In order to study the behaviour of passengers in the vehicle interior during the collision, acceleration pulses generated by the above rake models were used as input to Finite Element models of the vehicle interior which included dummies, placed in various seating arrangements. The investigation of interior crashworthiness of occupants began by `tuning' some selected input parameters of the non-linear Finite Element dummy model so that its behaviour matched that found in an actual sled test. The effects of various pulses on the occupant have also be investigated. These pulses contain the parametric effects caused by couplers, damping forces, spring characteristics, initial impact velocities and inter-vehicular distances. Assessments of the injury potential of occupants are based on comparing the selected output forces/moments from the dummy models to well-established human injury criteria. Another major aspect of this crashworthiness study included an investigation into the collapse behaviour of simple components (e. g. tubes and beams) in order to gain an insight as to how energy is absorbed during structural collapse. It is also important to study how recycled energy absorbers function and how much energy absorbing capacity has been lost after the recycling process. Studies of this nature are included in the Appendices of this thesis for tubes made from High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) ...|$|R
