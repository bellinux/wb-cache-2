40|$|Background and Aim: Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) {{is usually}} associated with chronic liver diseases and liver cirrhosis, while conversely, cholangiocarcinoma (CC) usually occurs in a non-cirrhotic liver. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to evaluate CC in liver cirrhosis. Methods: Between January 1998 and December 1999, 26 patients with CC were retrospectively reviewed. The occurrence of CC in chronic hepatitis B infection-related liver cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and survival were analyzed. Results: Twenty-six patients with CC (19 with a non-cirrhotic liver and seven with chronic hepatitis B infection-related liver cirrhosis) were included in the present study. All cases of CC in the cirrhotic group were incidentally discovered during routine screening for HCC. The mean age (±SD) was 58. 8 ± 14 years in the cirrhotic group and 73. 2 ± 15. 9 years (P= 0. 001) in the non-cirrhotic group. When compared to the cirrhotic group, the non-cirrhotic group had a higher median level of albumin (42 compared to 30 g/L, P= 0. 005), bilirubin (117. 5 compared to 18 μmol/L, P= 0. 01), alkaline phosphatase (291. 5 compared to 100 U/L, P= 0. 001) and <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidases</b> (215. 5 compared to 31 U/L, P= 0. 001). In contrast, the cirrhotic group had a higher median prothrombin time (PT) compared to the non-cirrhotic group (18. 2 compared to 12 s, P= 0. 05). In the non-cirrhotic group, only one patient (5. 3 %) showed evidence of PVT on a computerized tomography and Doppler ultrasound, while in the cirrhotic group six patients (85. 7 %) had PVT (P< 0. 001). The median survival period in the cirrhotic group was six months (range 2 - 24 months) compared to 16 months (range 6 - 41 months) in the non-cirrhotic group (P= 0. 036). Conclusion: CC in cirrhotic liver presented at a younger age and patients who developed CC were prone to PVT. The survival period was also shorter in comparison to that of non-cirrhotic liver patients. © 2003 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{hepatic injury}} induced by carbon {{tetrachloride}} (CCl 4) {{as well as}} gamma-irradiation has taken most attention. Prevention {{is one of the}} essential ways of controlling this toxicity and the use of natural plant compounds as grape seed extract can be considered {{as one of the most}} significant elements in this prevention. The present study is also designed to evaluate the hepatoprotective effects of grape seed extract (100 mg/kg B. wt daily) against the toxic effect of CCl 4 (0. 3 ml/kg B. wt twice weekly for 8 weeks) and/ or fractionated doses of 2 Gy -radiation day after day up to 10 Gy in male rats. Results obtained could be summarized as follows: Combined treatments of CCl 4 and -radiation induced a significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) level, and decreased level of reduced glutathione (GSH). It also increased serum enzymes aspartate transferase (AST), alanine transferase (ALT), a lkaline phosphatase (ALP) and <b>gamma</b> - <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> (-GT) activities and decreased Hb%, RBCs, WBCs and platelets count. Proanthocyanidin administration improved the significant increase in MDA level and ameliorated serum enzymes as well as improved the decreased level of GSH content of irradiated rats or those treated with CCl 4. It also could normalize the blood constituents Hb%, RBCs, WBCs and platelets count.

40|$|High {{levels of}} <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> and {{alkaline}} phosphatase {{were found in}} T-tube bile from patients undergoing cholecystectomy and exploration of the common bile duct for gallbladder and/or ductal stones for up to 9 days after operation. The activities of these enzymes and leucine aminopeptidase were higher in bile than in serum obtained {{during the period of}} bile drainage. The patterns of bile activity were different for all 3 enzymes. <b>Gamma</b> <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> activity reached a maximum 3 days after operation and then gradually declined, while alkaline phosphatase activity increased progressively for 8 days although values appeared to plateau between Days 7 and 9. There was, however, no significant linear correlation between the mean values of these enzymes. Smaller and more variable changes were observed in the activity of leucine aminopeptidase but on average the levels of this enzyme continued to increase throughout the collection period, and correlated significantly with the values for the other 2 enzymes. Although the high activities of alkaline phosphatase may be due to induction of this enzyme in the liver, the presence of <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> and leucine aminopeptidase in the bile is probably a result of continuing hepatic injury. It appears that bile is used as a major route for the elimination of at least these 3 enzymes from damaged tissue in the liver.

30|$|Serum lactate {{dehydrogenase}} (LDH) activity {{was determined by}} the method of King (1965) [20]. The method is based on the ability of LDH to convert lactate to pyruvate with the help of coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). The pyruvate formed is made to react with 2, 4 –dinitrophenyl hydrazine in hydrochloric acid. The hydrazone formed in alkaline medium was read at 540 [*]nm. The γ–glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT) activity in serum was also estimated following the method of Orlowski and Meister (1965) [21]. This enzyme catalyzes transfer of <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyl</b> groups from <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyl</b> peptides to suitable acceptor.

40|$|Abstract: A {{reduction}} in serum enzymes has been already observed by administering ursodeoxycholic acid {{to patients with}} chronic active hepatitis. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess whether the Liver histological activity of inflammation was modified by a 12 -month treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid. Thirty-six patients with chronic active hepatitis, fulfilling the inclusion criteria, were admitted to the trial. Patients were randomly allocated to receive double blind either 600 mg/day of ursodeoxycholic acid (Group A: 18 patients) or placebo (Group B: 18 patients). Clinical and biochemical follow-up was performed at 3 -month intervals. A percutaneous liver biopsy was performed before and after 1 year of treatment. Histological hepatitis activity was assessed using Knodell's numerical scoring system, while biliary damage was evaluated by an appropriate scoring system. Sixteen and 12 patients in Groups A and B, respectively, completed the clinical and biochemical follow-up. Although a {{reduction in}} serum enzymes was found in both groups, multifactorial covariance analysis showed that the reductions in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> were significantly higher in Group A than in Group B. Biochemical remission was not observed in either group. Histological analysis showed a dichotomy between the results from the hepatitis and the biliary components of the disease process. No differences were found in the two groups before or after treatment in histological activity index, which measures the ''hepatitic'' component. Nor were there any significant differences in baseline values. Furthermore, no relationship was found between changes in biochemical parameters and the histological activity indices. In contrast, the ''biliary'' component showed significant improvement after ursodeoxycholic acid treatment for certain cholestatic parameters: ductular metaplasia, bile duct damage and phenotypic cytokeratin changes. These changes were significantly associated with changes in <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> serum levels. This study has confirmed that ursodeoxycholic acid administration in patients with chronic active hepatitis reduces transaminases and <b>gamma</b> <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase.</b> The morphological substrate of this biochemical improvement can be traced to the biliary component of the process.

BackgroundA variety of mechanisms {{have been considered}} in the pathogenesis of the cell damage occurring in the kidney that is undergoing transient ischemia. However, little information is available {{about the role of}} oxidative stress in building up the tissue injury in the hypoxic organ during short-term ischemia. MethodsAfter a standard brief period (25 min) of unilateral kidney ischemia in rats, pretreated or not with acivicin (60 μmol/L/kg i. v.), tissue samples from both ischemic and not ischemic kidneys were obtained to measure malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) content, γ <b>glutamyl</b> <b>transpeptidase</b> (GGT) activity by spectrophotometry, localization and intensity of enzyme activity, and tissue damage by histochemistry. ResultsGGT activity was found to be increased in both cortical and medullar zones of the ischemic kidneys, where the GSH level was only slightly decreased and the MDA level, in contrast, was markedly increased; in parallel, the cytosolic volume of the proximal tubular (PT) cells showed a significant increment. The animal pretreatment with acivicin, a specific inhibitor of GGT, besides preventing the up-regulation of the enzyme during ischemia, afforded good protection against the observed changes of MDA and GSH tissue levels, as well as of tubular cell volume. ConclusionsEx vivo data supporting a net pro-oxidant effect of up-regulated GGT during short-term ischemia of rat kidney have been obtained. The enzyme stimulation appears to contribute to the renal morphological damage exerted by a brief hypoxic condition at the level of PT cells.
