25|$|Another {{remedy that}} Singapore courts might apply if an {{appropriate}} case arises – {{though it has}} yet to do so – is the granting of temporary validity to unconstitutional laws. When a piece of legislation is ruled as unconstitutional, a lacuna or <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> may ensue as the legislation is void retrospectively and prospectively. The situation is exacerbated if the legislation is one with far-reaching effects. Hence, to overcome the negative impact of such a lacuna, the Supreme Court of Canada has adopted the remedy of granting temporary validity to unconstitutional legislation for the minimum time necessary for the legislature to enact alternative laws.|$|E

40|$|The basic {{question}} is whether and in what sense {{it is possible to}} speak about <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> If we disagree with Kelsen 2 ̆ 7 s thesis that <b>the</b> nature of <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is that of an ideological formula, then we have to define them legally and to find the criteria regarding how they can be filled. It is also important that incompletenesses as regards contents - Hart treats them as "open texture" - are organic (natural, inevitable) parts of <b>laws.</b> <b>The</b> Slovene Courts Act is in accord with this thesis and for that very reason provides - the provision was written by the author of this paper - that "the judge has to decide {{in such a way as}} if he had in front of him an indefinite number of equal cases" (Art. 3 / 3) ...|$|R

50|$|The Crimes Against Humanity Initiative {{had three}} primary objectives: (1) {{to study the}} law and sociological reality as regards the {{commission}} of crimes against humanity; (2) to combat the indifference and the negative legal consequences emergent from the idea that crimes against humanity are less serious than genocide; and (3) to address the <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> by elaborating the first-ever comprehensive specialized convention on crimes against humanity.|$|E
50|$|The {{scope of}} general {{principles}} of law, to which Article 38(1) of the Statute of the ICJ refers, is unclear and controversial but may include such legal principles {{that are common}} to {{a large number of}} systems of municipal law.

40|$|Normative order’s notion {{does not}} pretend {{to develop some}} kind of a {{rigorous}} science of perfectunderstanding of human and social processes, nor does it claim to provide the final truth of normativeprocesses at all levels.

50|$|Although the 1995 Constitution {{provides}} for equality {{between men and}} women, there are still <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> which affect women’s rights to land. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> protects <b>the</b> rights to land of wives in marriage; however, it {{does not address the}} needs of widows or divorcees. Consequentially, these women are left landless and without the protection land offers. Also, women have a difficult time taking cases to court due to corruption and expensive trials. The trials concerning land take so long to process that many women do not even attempt to seek legal assistance.|$|R

50|$|In many cases, such 641 {{prosecution}} is impossible because title has {{passed to the}} recipient before the property is stolen, or the funds are so commingled that the Federal character of the funds cannot be shown. This situation {{gives rise to a}} serious <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> since even though title to the monies may have passed, the Federal Government clearly retains a strong interest in assuring the integrity of such program funds. Indeed, a recurring problem in this area (as well as in the related area of bribery of the administrators of such funds) has been that state and local prosecutors are often unwilling to commit their limited resources to pursue such thefts, deeming the United States the principal party aggrieved.|$|E
5000|$|In law, a non liquet is a {{situation}} where there is no applicable law. Non liquet translates into English from Latin as [...] "it is not clear." [...] According to Cicero, the term was applied during the Roman Republic to a verdict of [...] "not proven" [...] where the guilt or innocence of the accused was [...] "not clear." [...] Lacuna is a related word which means [...] "gap, void, defect, want, or loss" [...] and is used to indicate a <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> Lacunae are distinct from loopholes, in which a law exists but which can be circumvented legally due to an unforeseen or unintended inadequacy in the said law. A lacuna, on the other hand, is {{a situation}} in which a law or provision is lacking in the first place.|$|E

40|$|While {{the media}} is rightly {{concerned}} about protecting freedom of expression, this paper argues that this must not be {{to the exclusion of}} privacy rights.

50|$|There is {{currently}} no freestanding {{right to privacy}} at common law. This point was reaffirmed when the House of Lords ruled in Home Office v Wainwright (a case involving a strip search undertaken on the plaintiff Alan Wainwright while visiting Armley prison).

In the absence of a common law right to privacy in English law torts such as the equitable doctrine breach of confidence, torts linked to the intentional infliction of harm to the person and public law torts relating to the use of police powers have been used to fill a <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> The judiciary has developed the law in an incremental fashion and have resisted the opportunity to create a new tort.|$|E

40|$|The book {{purports to}} provide a primer about {{statutory}} and constitutional interpretation, addressed to law students and methodology-freak legal practitioners. Chapter 1, dealing with the logical structure of judicial decisions, outlines a theory of legal syllogysm totally deprived of whatever tinge of naïf logicism. Chapter 2 deals with the basic concepts and tools of textual interpretation of statutes and constitutions, around the “interpretive codes” perspective. Chapter 3 is entirely devoted to developing a realistic, legal-practice oriented, theory of <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> Chapter 4 does the same with normative conflicts (antonomies).

40|$|There is no {{international}} {{agreement on the}} vertical limit of State sovereignty, the boundary between territorial airspace and outer space. The need for defining this boundary has been debated for over 50 years. Today, the need to settle this <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> is growing in importance. This thesis concludes that setting a low vertical limit on State sovereignty is the best approach because it will allow all States free access to space and enable uniform international rules to be set at a relatively low altitude. Chapter I discusses territorial sovereignty and examines the evolution of vertical sovereignty. It then compares this {{to the evolution of}} the law governing territorial seas and concludes by examining the airspace laws of several States.
