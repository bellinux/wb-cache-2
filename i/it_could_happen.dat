25|$|A {{particular}} robustness {{issue is}} the requirement for a control system to perform properly {{in the presence of}} input and state constraints. In the physical world every signal is limited. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> that a controller will send control signals that cannot be followed by the physical system, for example, trying to rotate a valve at excessive speed. This can produce undesired behavior of the closed-loop system, or even damage or break actuators or other subsystems. Specific control techniques are available to solve the problem: model predictive control (see later), and anti-wind up systems. The latter consists of an additional control block that ensures that the control signal never exceeds a given threshold.|$|E

25|$|At the {{earliest}} stage, this basic principle {{applied only to}} the relation between longa and breve. Beginning with Franco of Cologne, the same pattern was also applied between breves and semibreves, and finally, with Philippe de Vitry's theory of the Ars nova, it was taken yet another level down, to the newly introduced minims. From that time onwards, imperfection and alteration could happen {{on the level of}} breves and semibreves whenever the piece was in tempus perfectum, and <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> between semibreves and minims if the piece was in prolatio maior.

Skarstedt felt surrounded by [...] "arrogance {{on one side and}} obsequiousness on the other, a manifest scorn for menial labor, a desire to appear to be more than one was". This traveller too was incessantly hearing American civilization and culture denigrated from the depths of upper-class Swedish prejudice: [...] "If I, in all modesty, told something about America, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> that in reply I was informed that this could not possibly be so or that the matter was better understood in Sweden." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to its {{commercial}} and critical success, Square Enix released a direct sequel to Final Fantasy X in 2003, titled Final Fantasy X-2. The sequel is set {{two years after}} the conclusion of Final Fantasy X, establishing new conflicts and dilemmas and resolving loose ends left by the original game. Although the sequel did not sell as well as the original, 3.96 million units versus 6.6 million units, it can still be considered a commercial success. As a result of the title's popularity, Yoshinori Kitase and Kazushige Nojima decided to establish a plot-related connection between Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy VII, another well-received Final Fantasy game. In 2013, after the release of the HD Remaster, Nojima stated {{that he would like to}} see a second sequel to X, and if there were demand for it, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen.</b> The minigame of blitzball has made it into other games, such as Final Fantasy X-2, and was mentioned as a possibility for [...]|$|E

Christina Ricci also considered it a possibility; she stated [...] "When we [...] were all leaving, we were like 'write the sequel!' 'We want to come back'. And they [...] were like, 'I know. I know.

500|$|In 1766 {{supercargo}} Johann Krause {{was probably}} the most experienced merchant trading in Madagascar, although he had been [...] "guilty of an earlier indiscretion in 1760", on the VOC ship Neptunus. To avoid the loss of profit caused by captive Malagasy dying while at sea, Krause convinced Captain Muller, who was in his first command and was unwell at the time, to unshackle some of them and let them work on deck. Disease was spreading among the Malagasy in the unsanitary conditions below deck, and the ship's surgeon had reported that, while there were no suitable medicines on board, disease was spreading to the crew. Consequently, two days after the ship had left Madagascar, the crew released a [...] "large party of [...] " [...] from confinement, the men assisting the crew and the women providing entertainment by dancing and singing. The Malagasy Massavana and some others were set to controlling and taking care of the sails, which has been described as [...] "unheard of, and certainly against all [...] regulations". Allowing slaves into secure areas on deck was common practice on most European vessels, and VOC regulations did permit slaves to be released onto the deck from time to time, under careful supervision. But the chief concern was that slaves might jump overboard to escape, rather than that they might mutiny, despite a slave mutiny on the VOC ship Drie Heuvelen in 1753. That mutiny was quickly suppressed, but clearly <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> again, making Captain Muller's agreement to the kind of release that occurred on Meermin [...] "appear all the more foolish." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Love Story" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy, who previously directed the videos for the singles from Taylor Swift. Swift decided to collaborate with Fanjoy once again {{because she had been}} able to balance both of their ideas for music videos, something Swift appreciated deeply. The video is a period piece that draws influence from Medieval, Renaissance, and Regency eras. Swift had previously desired to film a period piece music video because of its distinctiveness from modern videos and videos she had filmed. When writing the song, she envisioned it in a prior time period, and encoded it with details accordingly. She believed [...] "Love Story"'s plot was a timeless scenario: [...] "I think <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> in the 1700s, the 1800s, or 2008." [...] Thus, she searched for a timeless quality in demeanor of her love interest. With six months in advance, Swift searched by watching films for actors to interpret the role. An acquaintance of hers, who followed the sixth season of Nashville Star, recommended contestant Justin Gaston. Swift then looked through his pictures, and concluded he was suitable for the music video. Gaston fulfilled the requirements Swift had set out, describing him as a [...] "Prince Charming that could've been alive in the 1800s." [...] However, because Gaston was competing on Nashville Star, he was unable to participate in the music video. Gaston was eventually eliminated and Swift contacted him immediately to film the video. Swift was very impressed by Gaston's acting skills: [...] "I was so impressed by the way his [...] were in the video. Without even saying anything, he would just do a certain glance and it really came across well." ...|$|E
