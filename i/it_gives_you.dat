So you have about five different cameras shooting a performance, and after they edit like crazy. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> a lot of freedom, but I feel very frustrated because I like to see somebody dancing. I hate when there's too much editing. I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy {{the movement of the}} body. You see the skill.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, as I tell {{my white}} friends, we as black people, we're {{never going to}} be {{successful}}, not because of you white people, but because of other black people. When you're black, {{you have to deal with}} so much crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E
25|$|Downtown Makati {{is the one}} of {{the most}} easily {{accessed}} business districts in the Philippines. Public transportation within the city is facilitated mostly using inexpensive jeepneys and buses for commuters working in the district. Most of the buses and jeepneys come from EDSA, the main thoroughfare in Metro Manila. Buses plying the avenue from Parañaque to Caloocan pass through the central business/financial district daily. EDSA Carpark Building in Ayala Center is the main public transport terminal inside the district. It is accessible for shoppers going to SM Makati and Glorietta. This can also accommodate the vehicles of passengers riding the MRT. There are also available intercity bus in downtown that plies routes from Ayala Center to Fort Bonifacio via McKinley Road operated only by Bonifacio Transport Corporation. The city will open the new transport hub of Makati called the McKinley Exchange, which is also along EDSA outside downtown. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> an efficient and convenient transport experience for both commuters and tourists. People enter and leave the city through this new central transport hub.|$|E

Beyoncé's rendition was included on the 2007 deluxe edition of her second studio album, B'Day. Beyoncé contributed to the writing and production processes, {{and it was one}} of the last tracks to be added to the album.

At the Amateur Athletics Association (AAA) trials in Birmingham his run of 10.01s was the fastest ever wind-legal time {{recorded}} in Britain by a British sprinter. Chambers ran with consistency {{in the summer of}} 2001: he won at the Seville Grand Prix in 10.01s and finished third in ten seconds flat at the Athletissima meet. In the run up to the 2001 IAAF Edmonton World Championships Chambers compared his own performances to the British record holder: [...] "I am very consistent in the 10.00s this year, and that bodes well for the Worlds.

Travolta responded a week later to the awards: [...] "I didn't even know there were such awards. I have people around me {{whose job it is}} to not tell me about such things. They're obviously doing their job. Not every film can be a critical and box office success. It would have been awful only if Battlefield Earth was neither. That's not the case. It is edging toward the $100m mark which means it has found an audience even if it didn't impress critics.

500|$|Rivera had an {{impeccable}} {{ability to}} accurately locate pitches and consistently throw strikes, {{particularly on the}} inside and outside edges of the strike zone. This strength offset his reliance on one pitch and hitters' anticipation of it. His former catcher Joe Girardi said, [...] "He was so easy to catch because he always put the ball right there. I don't think there's ever been a pitcher that great who was so easy to catch." [...] Rivera's 4.10 career strikeout-to-walk ratio in the regular season ranks ninth-best in major league history. His control was a byproduct of his smooth, easily repeated pitching motion, which some opposing hitters found to be deceptive. One such player, Darrin Fletcher, said in 1999 that Rivera [...] "almost kind of lulls you to sleep with his delivery. <b>It</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> a false sense of security, and then the ball is on you and it's exploding." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{ultimate}} {{revelation of}} Danielle's identity {{was set at}} Archie's wedding to Peggy (Barbara Windsor), matriarch of the Mitchell family. Crace deemed the wedding [...] "the perfect opportunity" [...] for the storyline to conclude, and Santer explained: [...] "Weddings are great because they bring the community together. A wedding gives you a stage, <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> an event, the context to play things out, so it felt right that these big Mitchell stories would collide at Peggy's wedding." [...] Writer James Payne concurred that setting the reveal at the wedding helped to make the moment [...] "as dramatic and sensational" [...] as it could possibly be. The episode saw Danielle announce that she was Ronnie's daughter {{in front of the}} entire wedding reception party, in what Crace has named her favourite scene on the show. She opined that the disbelief Danielle was faced with was [...] "heartbreaking" [...] and served to highlight the fact that [...] "she came as the outsider and she still is the outsider because no one steps in to help her".|$|E

500|$|Liverpool's victory {{meant they}} won the trophy for the eighth time, {{extending}} their record number of victories in the competition. Midfielder Stewart Downing was awarded the Alan Hardaker Trophy as {{the man of the}} match. Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was delighted to have won the League Cup and was adamant that the club would continue to win trophies: [...] "Although we have won something today, that is not us finished, we don't want to stop here.

I know how much the players have enjoyed it and <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> a wee flavour to come back and do it again." [...] The victory meant that Dalglish became the seventh manager to win all three major domestic trophies in English football. Goalscorer Dirk Kuyt was equally delighted to have won the competition: [...] "We wanted this so desperately, this is why I came to Anfield. To get my first medal is great." [...] Meanwhile, captain Steven Gerrard had mixed emotions, due to his cousin Anthony Gerrard missing the deciding penalty: [...] "One of Anthony or I was going to be sad, one was going to be celebrating. It happens. I've got mixed emotions at the moment because I feel for Anthony and Cardiff." ...|$|E
500|$|Shaw's {{views on}} {{religion}} and Christianity were less consistent. Having in his youth proclaimed himself an atheist, in middle age he explained this as a reaction against the Old Testament image of a vengeful Jehovah. By the early twentieth century, he termed himself a [...] "mystic", although Gary Sloan, in an essay on Shaw's beliefs, disputes his credentials as such. In 1913 Shaw declared {{that he was not}} religious [...] "in the sectarian sense", aligning himself with Jesus as [...] "a person of no religion". In the preface (1915) to Androcles and the Lion, Shaw asks [...] "Why not give Christianity a chance?" [...] contending that Britain's social order resulted from the continuing choice of Barabbas over Christ. In a broadcast just before the Second World War, Shaw invoked the Sermon on the Mount, [...] "a very moving exhortation, and <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> one first-rate tip, which is to do good to those who despitefully use you and persecute you". In his will, Shaw stated that his [...] "religious convictions and scientific views cannot at present be more specifically defined than as those of a believer in creative revolution". He requested that no one should imply that he accepted the beliefs of any specific religious organisation, and that no memorial to him should [...] "take the form of a cross or any other instrument of torture or symbol of blood sacrifice".|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} saw {{the season}} as [...] "two shows"; Wyman noted, [...] "It's on us to make the mythology over there just as compelling as the mythology here, so we will enjoy both of them. We have our characters going back and forth, there or here, but there's {{a whole set of}} nice characters that you'll become very interested in very quickly. It's interesting because <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> that gearshift." [...] Wyman later added that parallel universe plot device [...] "really allowed us to explore the characters deeper via their doppelgängers, to illuminate characters we already know. It’s been a real gas for all of us involved in making the show." [...] Historical idiosyncrasies were inserted into the parallel universe, such as a still-living John F. Kennedy, the non-existence of the FBI, and the Back to the Future franchise starring Eric Stoltz rather than Michael J. Fox. The writers loved creating an entire new world, and asked themselves what life would have been like in its most mundane forms, such as within daily routines. Pinkner thought it allowed them to create and explore many [...] "what-if" [...] moments, such as if the September 11 attacks had occurred against the White House instead of the Twin Towers, or if the Statue of Liberty still possessed its shiny copper sheen. [...] "Entrada", the eighth episode, {{was the first of the}} season to divide its time between both universes.|$|E
