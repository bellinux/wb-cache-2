50|$|A vacuum arc {{can arise}} when the {{surfaces}} of metal electrodes in contact with a good vacuum begin to emit electrons either through heating (thermionic emission) or via an electric field that is sufficient to cause field electron emission. Once initiated, a vacuum arc can persist since the freed particles gain kinetic energy from the electric field, heating the metal surfaces through high speed particle collisions. This process can create an <b>incandescent</b> <b>cathode</b> spot which frees more particles, thereby sustaining the arc. At sufficiently high currents an incandescent anode spot may also be formed.|$|E
40|$|Calculated {{trajectories of}} ions with {{different}} masses, indicating {{the possibility of}} a mixture separation, are obtained. Comparative experiments for plasma of monatomic and polyatomic gases (Ar, N 2, CO 2), upon combination of pulsed discharge with a stationary one with <b>incandescent</b> <b>cathode,</b> are carried out. The oscillograms of discharge current and voltage at low emission currents and a constant energy input show that energy is spent on other processes different from ionization. With an increase of emission current, the nonlinear character of the discharge current and voltage, which may be indicative of the role of dissociation and vibrational levels in energy consumption, is observed. In addition, there is connection between the number of atoms in molecule and the values of maximum discharge current and the pressure of injected gas...|$|E
5000|$|Since a [...] "perfect vacuum" [...] {{contains}} no charged particles, it normally behaves {{as a perfect}} insulator. However, metal electrode surfaces can cause a region of the vacuum to become conductive by injecting free electrons or ions through either field electron emission or thermionic emission. Thermionic emission occurs when the thermal energy exceeds the metal's work function, while field electron emission occurs when the electric field at {{the surface of the}} metal is high enough to cause tunneling, which results in the ejection of free electrons from the metal into the vacuum. Externally heated electrodes are often used to generate an electron cloud as in the filament or indirectly heated cathode of vacuum tubes. Cold electrodes can also spontaneously produce electron clouds via thermionic emission when small <b>incandescent</b> regions (called <b>cathode</b> spots or anode spots) are formed. These are incandescent regions of the electrode surface that are created by a localized high current. These regions may be initiated by field electron emission, but are then sustained by localized thermionic emission once a vacuum arc forms. These small electron-emitting regions can form quite rapidly, even explosively, on a metal surface subjected to a high electrical field. Vacuum tubes and sprytrons are some of the electronic switching and amplifying devices based on vacuum conductivity.|$|R
50|$|This {{very high}} power {{dissipation}} in the tube heats the glass walls to {{a temperature of}} several hundred degrees Celsius, and any dirt and impurities within are drawn off in the gasified form by the vacuum pump. The greatest impurities that are driven off this way are the gases that coat the inside wall of the tubing by adsorption, mainly oxygen, carbon dioxide, and especially water vapor. The current also heats the electrode metal to over 600oC, producing a bright orange <b>incandescent</b> color. The <b>cathodes</b> are prefabricated hollow metal shells with a small opening (sometimes a ceramic donut aperture) which contains in the interior surface of the shell a light dusting of a cold cathode low work function powder (usually a powder ceramic molar eutectic point mixture including BaCO2), combined with other alkaline earth oxides, which reduces to BaO2 when heated to about 500 degrees F, and reduces the work function of the electrode for cathodic emission. Barium Oxide has a work function of roughly 2 eV whereas tungsten at room temperature has a work function 100 times more, or 4.0 eV. This represents the cathode drop or electron energy required to remove electrons {{from the surface of}} the cathode. This avoids the necessity of using a hot wire thermoelectric cathode such as is used in conventional fluorescent lamps. And for that reason, neon tubes are extremely long lived when properly processed, in contrast to fluorescent tubing, because there is no wire filament as there is in a fluorsecent tube to burn out like a common light bulb. The principal purpose of doing this is to purify the interior of the tube before the tube is sealed off so that when it is operated, these gases and impurities are not driven off and released by the plasma and the heat generated into the sealed tube, which would quickly burn the metal cathodes and mercury droplets (if pumped with argon/mercury) and oxidize the interior gases and cause immediate tube failure. The more thorough the purification of the tube is, the longer lasting and stable the tube will be in actual operation. Once these gases and impurities are liberated under pre-filling bombardment into the tube interior they are quickly evacuated by the pump.|$|R
