40|$|Growing {{advancement}} in electronic {{human resource management}} (e-HRM) in general, and human resource (<b>HR)</b> <b>self-service</b> technology in particular, has afforded transformational opportunities in changing the design and delivery of HR services. Despite their importance, {{our understanding of how}} acceptance of these technologies can be improved remains limited. To address this shortfall, this study utilises the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to consider how HR can drive and influence the adoption of <b>HR</b> <b>self-service</b> technology in an organisation. Utilising an action research approach, this study documents and reflects on the experience of a UK building society in introducing a new version of <b>HR</b> <b>self-service</b> technology, and analyses how interventions can be used to reshape users' perceptions. Our findings show how HR can play a more proactive role in shaping and reshaping users' perceptions towards accepting such a technology by better understanding how systematic interventions can be developed, used and evaluated. Our contributions are not only limited to the theorisation of <b>HR</b> <b>self-service</b> technology based on TAM, but also lie in demonstrating how action research, although currently underused, can be a valid and valuable approach for HR research and practice...|$|E
