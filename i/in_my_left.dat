500|$|One of {{the most}} {{acclaimed}} actors of his generation, Day-Lewis has earned numerous awards, including three Academy Awards for Best Actor for his performances <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Left</b> Foot (1989), There Will Be Blood (2007) and Lincoln (2012), making him the only male actor in history to have three wins in the lead actor category and {{one of only three}} male actors to win three Oscars. He was also nominated in this category for In the Name of the Father (1993) and Gangs of New York (2002). He has also won four BAFTA Awards for Best Actor, three Screen Actors Guild Awards and two Golden Globe Awards. In November 2012, Time named Day-Lewis the [...] "World's Greatest Actor". In June 2014, he received a knighthood at Buckingham Palace for services to drama.|$|E
500|$|From 2006 to 2007, Sheen starred as the {{television}} broadcaster David Frost in Frost/Nixon {{at both the}} Donmar Warehouse and Gielgud Theatre in London and at the Jacobs Theatre on Broadway. The play, written by Peter Morgan, directed by Michael Grandage and co-starring Frank Langella, was a critical and commercial success but Sheen initially accepted the role as a favour to his friends and [...] "never {{thought it was going}} anywhere". The Guardian said the actor [...] "exactly captures Frost's verbal tics and mannerisms while suggesting a nervousness behind the self-assurance". [...] "He's got the voice, the mannerisms, the blaze," [...] said the Financial Times, [...] "but, more than that, Sheen—as viscerally exciting an actor as any in Britain today—shows us the hunger of Frost's ambition [...]. and fox-like instinct for the hunt and the kill." [...] Sheen was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor and a Drama League Award for Distinguished Performance. Sheen next appeared in the 2007 film Music Within as a political activist with cerebral palsy. He spoke of having a [...] "responsibility" [...] to accurately portray the condition. Variety said his performance was [...] "remarkable.. utterly convincing", USA Today found him [...] "outstanding" [...] while the Los Angeles Times felt he was [...] "reminiscent of Daniel Day-Lewis <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Left</b> Foot, bringing a vibrancy and wit to the role". Also that year, Sheen starred in the short film Airlock, or How To Say Goodbye in Space with Derek Jacobi and was invited to join the actors' branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.|$|E

She must have heard what I had done to Lauren because when I got to her she said, 'you're going to kill me, aren't you.' I said 'shut up' and walked around to her left side and I cut her throat two or three times. This was across her throat. The knife was <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> hand.

I said in my interview that it was the right side of the neck with my right hand but I am been thinking since. It wasn't my right thumb which was cut but my left.

2500|$|At {{one o'clock}} {{on the morning}} of April 2, 1865, my {{regiment}} broke camp near Petersburg, Va., and moved up to the enemy's front. Brigade pioneers and sharpshooters were ordered to rush in advance of the brigade. The pioneers were to remove all obstacles in front of the enemy's works, while the sharpshooters covered the parapet. I was at that time detailed as sergeant of the Third Brigade pioneers, and was second in command in the assault. The part of the line we were expected to carry was made of enclosed works, connected by breastworks of great strength with outer obstructions in the form of two lines of chevaux de frise and two lines of abatis. It was impossible to take the works while the enemy defended them, unless the several lines of obstruction were first removed. As Lieutenant Shiver was wounded early in the attack the command fell on me, and in directing the removal of the first two lines of the obstructions I received a shot over my ear and one <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>left</b> side and while removing the third line, a bullet shattered my right knee-joint, costing me, subsequently, the loss of my leg. Supporting myself on the abatis, I gave my orders to my men, and at last had the satisfaction of seeing them carry away the obstruction, thus enabling General Edwards to rout the enemy and cut the railroad and telegraph. The flag of the Thirty-seventh Massachusetts was the first to wave over the enemy's works.|$|E
