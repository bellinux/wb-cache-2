40|$|The Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor {{is widely}} {{accepted}} as the preferred switching device {{in a variety}} of power converters and motor drive applications. The device combines the advantages of high current density bipolar operation that results in low conduction losses with the advantages of the fast switching and low drive power of MOSFET gated devices. The basic idea behind IGBT is to increase the conductivity of a thick lightly <b>doped</b> <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layer,</b> thus reducing the on-resistance and losses associated with power MOSFET. This reduction in resistivity resulting from high level of carrier injection is referred to as conductivity modulation. When the IGBT is turned off, however, injected carriers must be extracted first before the device can sustain the reverse blocking voltage. Several models have been proposed in the literature to describe both DC and transient behaviors of IGBTs. These models can be broadly classified into two main categories: physics based models and behavioral or compact models. The dissertation compares the various approaches made in the literature to model the transient behavior of IGBTs. A new physics-based model for a Non Punch Through (NPT) IGBT during transient turn off period is presented. The steady state part of the model is derived from the solution of the ambipolar diffusion equation in the drift region of the IGBT. The transient component of the model is based on the availability of a newly developed expression for the excess carrier distribution in the base. The transient voltage is obtained numerically from this model. Alternatively, an analytical solution for the transient voltage is presented. The theoretical predictions of both approaches are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. The model is used to calculate the instantaneous power dissipation and the switching losses in IGBT for different device carrier lifetimes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{concentration}} of nitrogen and phosphorous in SiC bulk material and <b>epitaxial</b> <b>layers</b> was investigated using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS).

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the growth of}} in-situ n-type <b>doped</b> <b>epitaxial</b> Si <b>layers</b> with arsenic and phosphorus by means of low-temperature chemical vapor deposition using trisilane as Si-precursor. Indeed, {{in order to prevent}} the alteration of the characteristics of the devices which are already present on the wafer, an epitaxy process at low temperature is highly desired for applications such as BiCMOS. In this work, the varying parameters are the deposition temperature, the Si-precursor mass flow and the dopant gas flow. As a result, a process for the deposition of heavily doped epilayers was demonstrated at 600 °C with high deposition rate, which is important for maintaining high throughput and low process cost. We showed that using trisilane as a Si-precursor resulted in a much more linear n-type doping behavior than using dichlorosilane. Therefore it allowed an easier process control and a wider dynamic doping range. Our process is an interesting route for the epitaxy of a low-resistance emitter layer for bipolar transistor application. Peer reviewe...|$|R
