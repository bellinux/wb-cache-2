5000|$|The New World ROM {{introduced}} a much-improved {{version of the}} Open <b>Firmware</b> <b>interpreter,</b> version 3.0, which added many missing features, fixed most of the bugs from earlier versions, and had the capability to run CHRP boot scripts. The Toolbox ROM was embedded inside a CHRP script in the System Folder called [...] "Mac OS ROM", along with a short loader stub {{and a copy of}} the Happy Mac icon suitable for display from Open Firmware. Once the ROM was loaded from disk, the Mac boot sequence continued as usual. As before, Open Firmware could also run a binary boot loader, and version 3.0 added support for ELF objects as well as the XCOFF files versions 1.0.5 and 2.0 supported. Also, version 3.0 (as {{well as some of the}} last releases of version 2.x, starting with the PowerBook 3400) officially supported direct access to the Open Firmware command prompt from the console (by setting the auto-boot? variable to false from Mac OS, or by holding down Command-Option-O-F at boot).|$|E
50|$|<b>Interpreter</b> <b>firmware</b> is also {{available}} for some microcontrollers. For example, BASIC on the early microcontrollers Intel 8052; BASIC and FORTH on the Zilog Z8 {{as well as some}} modern devices. Typically these interpreters support interactive programming.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to standard processor architecture-specific device drivers, EFI {{provides for a}} processor-independent device driver stored in memory as EFI byte code or EBC. System <b>firmware</b> has an <b>interpreter</b> for EBC images. In that sense, EBC is analogous to Open Firmware, the hardware-independent firmware used in PowerPC-based Apple Macintosh and Sun Microsystems SPARC computers, among others.|$|R
