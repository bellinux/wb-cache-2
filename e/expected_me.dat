500|$|In his autobiography, Ganesan {{recalled}} {{that during the}} Afro-Asian film festival, [...] "I was called on stage and I went up a diminutive, five foot nothing, looking boyish with my build, whereas they had <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to be a colossus, on seeing [...] Kattabomman, at least seven or eight feet tall! Irrespective of this {{they gave me a}} standing ovation for five minutes." ...|$|E
500|$|Of his law {{practice}} in Manchester, Combs later noted: [...] "I {{had too many}} kinfolks and friends in Manchester, and they all <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to handle things as a favor... Then they'd get their feelings hurt if I charged them. I was taking {{in a lot of}} cases, but not sending out many bills." [...] In 1938, Combs accepted an offer from a law school classmate named LeRoy Combs (no relation) to join his father and uncle's law firm in Prestonsburg. Prestonsburg was closer to his wife's home in Knott County. Combs' son Tommy suffered from a form of mental retardation, the result of an injury sustained at birth. After moving to Prestonsburg, Combs started a class for people with mental retardation, in part so Tommy could attend the class.|$|E
500|$|Vulović {{underwent}} {{treatment in}} a Prague hospital until 12 March 1972, after {{which she was}} flown to Belgrade. She was offered a hypnotic injection to help her sleep during the flight back to Yugoslavia, but declined, explaining {{that she was not}} afraid of flying because she had no memory of the crash. In Belgrade, Vulović's hospital room was placed under 24-hour police protection because the authorities feared that the perpetrators of the bombing would want to kill her. The guards changed shifts every six hours, and no one was allowed in to see her except for her parents and doctors. Her hospitalization in Belgrade lasted until June 1972, after which she travelled to Montenegro to recuperate at a seaside resort, where her doctors visited her every two or three days. Vulović underwent several operations to restore her movement. At first, she could only move her left leg, and one month thereafter, she was once again able to move her right. Within ten months of her fall, Vulović had regained the ability to walk, but continued to limp {{for the rest of her}} life, her spine permanently twisted by the fall. [...] "Nobody ever <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to live this long," [...] she recounted. Vulović attributed her recovery to her [...] "Serbian stubbornness" [...] and [...] "a childhood diet that included chocolate, spinach, and fish oil." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Paris at her World Championships debut, Dibaba won the 5000 metres in {{a sprint}} finish against Marta Dominguez of Spain and Edith Masai of Kenya. This {{made her the}} {{youngest}} athlete to win an individual {{gold medal at the}} World Championships. Recalling the race, Dibaba said, [...] "I competed in Paris only because I had the 'A' standard. No one <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to win. There was no pressure from anywhere. All of them [...] were looking at each other [...] and no one was focusing on the finish line. I just went for it and was surprised that I had won." ...|$|E
2500|$|Frontman Kurt Cobain {{was found}} dead in his Seattle home on April 8, 1994, and Nirvana {{subsequently}} disbanded. Grohl received offers to work with various artists; press rumors indicated he might be joining Pearl Jam and he almost accepted a permanent position as drummer in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Ultimately Grohl declined and instead entered Robert Lang Studios in October 1994 to record fifteen of the forty songs he had written. With the exception of a guitar part on [...] "X-Static", played by Greg Dulli of the Afghan Whigs, Dave Grohl played every instrument and sang every vocal on the tracks. [...] "I was supposed to just join another band and be a drummer the rest of my life," [...] Grohl later said. [...] "I thought that I would rather do what no one <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to do. I enjoy writing music and I enjoy trying to sing, and there's nothing anyone can really do to discourage me." [...] Grohl completed an album's worth of material in five days and handed out cassette copies of the sessions to his friends for feedback.|$|E

2500|$|He assumed co-editorship of the School for Living's Brookville, Ohio-based Balanced Living {{magazine}} in 1962 and briefly returned to New York as {{associate editor of}} Ralph Ginzburg's quarterly fact: before leaving for Playboy, where he served as an associate editor from 1965 to 1971. According to Wilson, Playboy [...] "paid me a higher salary than any other magazine at which I had worked and never <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to become a conformist or sell my soul in return. I enjoyed my years in the Bunny Empire. I only resigned when I reached 40 and felt I could not live with myself if I didn't {{make an effort to}} write full-time at last." [...] Along with frequent collaborator Robert Shea, Wilson edited the magazine's Playboy Forum (not to be confused with The Playboy Advisor). During this period, he covered Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert's Millbrook, New York-based Castalia Foundation at the instigation of Alan Watts in The Realist, cultivated important friendships with William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, and lectured at the Free University of New York on 'Anarchist and Synergetic Politics' in 1965.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1979, Nathan {{returned}} to the Foreign Ministry and became its First Permanent Secretary until February 1982, when he left to become the Executive Chairman of the newspaper company the Straits Times Press. The appointment was viewed dimly by journalists who felt that the Government was trying to limit freedom of the press; they wore black armbands in protest. According to Nathan in a 2010 interview, [...] " [...] When they saw I was not doing what they <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to do, they began to have confidence." [...] At various times between 1982 and 1988, Nathan also held directorships of several other companies, including the Singapore Mint, The Straits Times Press (London), Singapore Press Holdings and Marshall Cavendish. He held a directorship in the Singapore International Media between September 1996 and August 1999. He was Chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Singapore, a ship-repairing and engineering joint venture with the Mitsubishi Group of Japan, from 1973 to 1986. From 1983 to April 1988, Nathan was Chairman of the Hindu Endowments Board. He was {{a founding member of}} the Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA), and its term trustee until August 1999.|$|E
2500|$|The {{burning of}} Brody had devoured {{almost half of}} the town – several hundred {{exclusively}} Jewish houses...With its old market place, the unsigned area looked impoverished and dejected. Many stores, especially the bigger one and richer ones, were locked or boarded up…The instant…I entered the market, we were surrounded by whole army of poor, ragged, famished kids, who were begging for a kopek. Most of them were Christian, but three or four were jewish. I gave each child a few kopeks, no matter what is his religion. But the instant I handed a coin to a Jew, all Christian children began shouting at me: [...] "Don’t give him anything! Don’t give him anything! He is a Jew! The children were joined by a Jewish beggar, a strange woman of about sixty. She wore a red dress, her grey hair was powdered, and her movements were nervous. She stood before me, grinning, her nasty, hungry eyes glaring at me, and she sort of danced a little. Then in a hoarse voice, mangling the language, she began warbling a sentimental Russian song, [...] "Ptichka Kanareyka", dearest little canary, about a young man who sends out a canary with a greeting for his beloved. The old beggar woman's screechy voice and outlandish appearance made a terrible impression on me. I gave her some coins and tried to hurry off. But she blocked my way, taring into my eyes and squawking her horrible song. She plainly <b>expected</b> <b>me</b> to be surprised that she could sing in Russian. I was haunted {{for the rest of the}} day by the nightmare of the beggar's appearance and performance.|$|E
