Officers are certified at five levels, of which the top four can use firearms. Level three consists of a call-out unit for each {{police district}}, consisting of a combined 646 people. This requires 103 hours of special training per year. Higher levels are required for body-guard service (55 officers) and the Emergency Response Union (73 officers). All certification curriculum is developed by and organized by the university college.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study in}} July 2017 by Miriam Hirt et al., {{published}} in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution found that the top speed of Tyrannosaurus was around 17mph (27km/h). Other dinosaurs including Triceratops, Velociraptor and Brachiosaurus were also analyzed in the study, as were many living animals like elephants, cheetahs and rabbits. The speed of Tyrannosaurus was calculated by factoring its weight in conjunction with the medium upon which it travelled (in the case of the theropod, land) and by the assumptions that: one; animals reach their maximum speeds during comparatively short sprints, and two; Newton's laws of motion <b>dictate</b> <b>that</b> mass has to overcome inertia. It found that large animals like Tyrannosaurus exhaust their energy reserves long before they reach their theoretical top speed, resulting in a parabola-like relationship between size and speed. The equation can calculate the top speed of an animal with almost 90% accuracy and can be applied to both living and extinct animals.|$|E

50|$|From the {{cognitive}} perspective, the brain perceives auditory stimuli as music according to gestalt principles, or “principles of grouping.” Gestalt principles include proximity, similarity, closure, and continuation. Each of the gestalt principles illustrates a different element of auditory stimuli that {{cause them to}} be perceived as a group, or as one unit of music. Proximity <b>dictates</b> <b>that</b> auditory stimuli that are near to each other are seen as a group. Similarity <b>dictates</b> <b>that</b> when multiple auditory stimuli are present, the similar stimuli are perceived as a group. Closure is the tendency to perceive an incomplete auditory pattern as a whole—the brain “fills in” the gap. And continuation <b>dictates</b> <b>that</b> auditory stimuli are more likely {{to be perceived as}} a group when they follow a continuous, detectable pattern.|$|R

25|$|The {{surface of}} road races is highly {{important}} and the IAAF <b>dictate</b> <b>that</b> the courses must be along man-made roads, bicycle paths or footpaths.

While soft ground, such as grass, is generally avoided, races may start and finish on soft ground or within a track and field stadium. Road racing courses come in two primary types: looped and point-to-point. Courses may be measured and designed to cover a standardised distance, such as , or they may simply follow a set route between two landmarks.|$|E

25|$|Additional damage {{occurred}} about 50 miles (80km) southeast in Anaheim as {{the scoreboard}} at Anaheim Stadium collapsed onto several hundred seats. The stadium was vacant at the time.

Also, because of known seismic activity in California, area building codes <b>dictate</b> <b>that</b> buildings incorporate structural design intended to withstand earthquakes. However, the damage caused revealed that some structural specifications did not perform as intended. Because of these revelations, building codes were revised.
