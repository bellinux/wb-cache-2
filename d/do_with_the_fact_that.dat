Much of this has to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Divan poetry is written in Ottoman Turkish, which was written using {{a variant of the}} Arabic script and made extensive use of Arabic and Persian words, making the language vastly different from modern Turkish. In its own time, knowledge of this form of literary Turkish was largely limited to the educated classes.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Awole there was a {{scramble}} for the throne by numerous contenders; some {{were reported to have}} spent less than six months on the throne; there was also a period of interregnum of almost twenty years where the various factions could not agree on a candidate for the throne. This period of vacuum led to the rise of powerful military and regional commanders like Adegun, the Onikoyi and others like the Otun to the Are-Ona Kakanfo, called Solagberu, and also Shehu Alimi, who was the leader of a growing Muslim population in Oyo. These new powers had lost regard for the office of the Alaafin due to the various political wranglings and the lack of a central authority at the time; this situation eventually led up to Afonja seceding Ilorin from Oyo in 1817 with the help of Oyo Muslims. In 1823, after Afonja had been killed by his allies, Shehu Alimi and Solagberu (Solagberu was also later killed by Alimi's son), Ilorin became part of the Sokoto Caliphate. By the time Captain Hugh Clapperton visited Oyo-Ile in 1825 during the reign of Alaafin Majotu, the empire was already in a state of decline. Clapperton's party recorded passing numerous Oyo villages burned by the Fulani (Ilorin) while Majotu had also sought the help of the English king and the Oba of Benin in putting down the Ilorin rebellion. Clapperton also noticed a shortage of horses, even though the Oyo were renowned as a great cavalry force; this might have something to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> most of the empire's soldiers and hence cavalry were stationed at Ilorin under the command of Afonja and later on Alimi's successors.|$|E

Now, as it turns out, Emma and Carl haven’t consummated their marriage at all, and this has something to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the show has combined Emma’s germ-phobia and virginity into some sort of terrifying psychosexual pathology that doesn’t make much sense and doesn’t resemble the somewhat levelheaded person she used to be. (The plotting in Will Schuester’s love life is the one place where the show attempts to have even a modicum of continuity, for whatever reason.) Anyway, Carl is necessarily upset about this, and he’s also upset when Holly Holliday gets Emma to admit that she still has confusing feelings for Will, so he resolves to let her stay in the condo while he stays in the Radisson where all of the good big-name Glee guest stars go to hope their pilots for the fall are picked up." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} title, Los Amantes de Tetuán, was shortened {{to simply}} Amantes to avoid confusion <b>with</b> <b>the</b> North African {{city of the}} same name.

The real life crime story was treated in the same way Billy Wilder <b>did</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that inspired James M. Cain's novel Double Indemnity.

When a fall guy is chosen for {{a highly publicized}} serial killer case, a homicide detective (played by Hwang Jung-min), a prosecutor (played by Ryoo), and a shady real-estate tycoon (played by Yoo Hae-jin) all become involved in a complex web of power struggle. The crime thriller was a hard-hitting indictment of corruption {{at every level of}} Korea's justice infrastructure. This was his fifth collaboration with Ryoo Seung-wan, who said, [...] "My decision to cast him isn't just because he's my younger brother.

500|$|Skeptics such as James Randi {{suggest that}} his {{reputation}} as a prophet is largely manufactured by modern-day supporters who fit his words to events that have either already occurred or are so imminent as to be inevitable, a process sometimes known as [...] "retroactive clairvoyance" [...] (postdiction). Thus, no Nostradamus quatrain is known to have been interpreted as predicting a specific event before it occurred, other than in vague, general terms that could equally apply to any number of other events. [...] This even applies to quatrains that contain specific dates, such as III.77, which predicts [...] "in 1727, in October, the king of Persia [...] captured by those of Egypt"—a prophecy that has, as ever, been interpreted retrospectively in the light of later events, in this case as though it presaged the known peace treaty between the Ottoman Empire and Persia of that year. Similarly, Nostradamus's notorious '1999' prophecy at X.72 (see Nostradamus in popular culture) describes no event that commentators have succeeded in identifying either before or since, other than by dint of twisting the words to fit whichever of the many contradictory happenings they are keen to claim as 'hits'. Moreover, no quatrain suggests, as is often claimed by books and films on the alleged Mayan Prophecy, that the world would end in December 2012. [...] In his preface to the Prophecies, Nostradamus himself stated that his prophecies extend 'from now to the year 3797'—an extraordinary date which, given that the preface was written in 1555, may have more than a little to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> 2242 (3797−1555) had recently been proposed by his major astrological source Richard Roussat as a possible date {{for the end of the}} world.|$|E

40|$|The {{photorealistic}} {{modeling of}} large-scale objects, such as urban scenes, requires {{the combination of}} range sensing technology and digital photography. In this paper, we attack the key problem of camera pose estimation, in an automatic and efficient way. First, the camera orientation is recovered by matching vanishing points (extracted from 2 D images) with 3 D directions (derived from a 3 D range model). Then, a hypothesis-and-test algorithm computes <b>the</b> camera positions <b>with</b> respect to <b>the</b> 3 D range model by matching corresponding 2 D and 3 D linear features. The camera positions are further optimized by minimizing a line-to-line distance. The advantage of our method over earlier work has to <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> we <b>do</b> not need to rely on extracted planar facades, or other higher-order features; we are utilizing lowlevel linear features. That makes this method more general, robust, and efficient. Our method can also be enhanced by the incorporation of traditional structure-from-motion algorithms. We have also developed a user-interface for allowing users to accurately texture-map 2 D images onto 3 D range models at interactive rates. We have tested our system in a large variety of urban scenes. 1...|$|R
