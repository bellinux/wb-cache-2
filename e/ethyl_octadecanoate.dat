40|$|This study {{looks at}} the wastes derived from Indonesian fruit as {{prospect}} for biofuels. This report investigates the chemical composition of Srikaya (Annona squamosal sp.) seed, which is disposed as waste products from traditional markets. The seeds were extracted with various extraction methods and the oil obtained was analysed by means of gas chromatography (GC/FID), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), infra-red spectrometry and ultra-violet-visible spectrometry. It was found 2 h extraction using soxhlet apparatus with diethyl ether as solvent gave the optimum time extraction. Moreover, five major components were isolated from i. e. : ethyl hexadecanoate, ethyl hexadec- 9 -enoate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>octadecanoate,</b> 2 -hydroxy- 1, 3 -propanediyl hexadecanoate, octadec- 9 -enaldehyde, and unknown compound, respectively. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{differentiate}} and characterize Madeira wines according to main grape varieties, the volatile composition (higher alcohols, fatty acids, ethyl esters and carbonyl compounds) was determined for 36 monovarietal Madeira wine samples elaborated from Boal, Malvazia, Sercial and Verdelho white grape varieties. The study {{was carried out}} by headspace solid-phase microextraction technique (HS-SPME), in dynamic mode, coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Corrected peak area data for 42 analytes from the above mentioned chemical groups was used for statistical purposes. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied {{in order to determine the}} main sources of variability present in the data sets and to establish the relation between samples (objects) and volatile compounds (variables). The data obtained by GC–MS shows that the most important contributions to the differentiation of Boal wines are benzyl alcohol and (E) -hex- 3 -en- 1 -ol. <b>Ethyl</b> <b>octadecanoate,</b> (Z) -hex- 3 -en- 1 -ol and benzoic acid are the major contributions in Malvazia wines and 2 -methylpropan- 1 -ol is associated to Sercial wines. Verdelho wines are most correlated with 5 -(ethoxymethyl) -furfural, nonanone and cis- 9 -ethyldecenoate. A 96. 4 % of prediction ability was obtained by the application of stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) using the 19 variables that maximise the variance of the initial data set...|$|E
