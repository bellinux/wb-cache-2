The 10 MW solar thermal power station would deliver about 30million kilowatt hours of electricity a year, enough to power the whole town. <b>Ergon</b> Energy will develop the project which should be running by early 2010.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} [...] "allergy" [...] was {{originally}} introduced in 1906 by the Viennese pediatrician Clemens von Pirquet, after {{he noted that}} some of his patients were hypersensitive to normally innocuous entities such as dust, pollen, or certain foods. Pirquet called this phenomenon [...] "allergy" [...] from the Ancient Greek words [...] allos meaning [...] "other" [...] and [...] <b>ergon</b> meaning [...] "work".|$|E
2500|$|Surgery (< cheirourgia, {{from the}} Greek cheir, [...] "hand" [...] + <b>ergon,</b> [...] "work") is {{the branch of}} {{medicine}} that deals with the physical manipulation of a bodily structure to diagnose, prevent, or cure an ailment. Ambroise Paré, a 16th-century French surgeon, stated that to perform surgery is, [...] "To eliminate that which is superfluous, restore that which has been dislocated, separate that which has been united, join that which has been divided and repair the defects of nature." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brăileanu {{was again}} freed {{in the spring}} of 1944 and {{repeatedly}} offered a chance to emigrate, which he declined. The year 1941 marked the end of Brăileanu's teaching career; he was forced to retire following his acquittal. Meanwhile, he continued his studies from 1941 to 1945, especially working on translations. In 1944, the official publishing company, Casa Școalelor, issued his Romanian version of the Nicomachean Ethics—according to literary critic Adrian Marino, it was a [...] "failed attempt", and [...] "downright impossible". Philosopher Cristian Ducu also notes Brăileanu's inconsistent translation of the term <b>ergon,</b> which results in [...] "grave errors at the conceptual level." ...|$|E
2500|$|The liturgy ( [...] , , from λαός / Laos, [...] "the people" [...] and {{the root}} [...] / <b>ergon,</b> [...] "work" [...] ) was in ancient Greece {{a public service}} {{established}} by the city-state whereby its richest members (whether citizens or resident aliens), more or less voluntarily, financed the State with their personal wealth. It took its legitimacy from the idea that [...] "personal wealth is possessed only through delegation from the city". The liturgical system {{dates back to the}} early days of Athenian democracy, but gradually fell into disuse {{by the end of the}} 4th century BC, eclipsed by the development of Euergetism in the Hellenistic period.|$|E
2500|$|Aristotle {{taught that}} virtue {{has to do}} with the proper {{function}} (<b>ergon)</b> of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the psuchē (normally translated as soul) in accordance with reason (logos). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, eudaimonia, generally translated as [...] "happiness" [...] or sometimes [...] "well being". To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (ēthikē aretē), often translated as moral (or ethical) virtue (or excellence).|$|E
2500|$|His [...] "One" [...] concept {{encompassed}} thinker and object. Even the self-contemplating intelligence (the noesis of the nous) {{must contain}} duality. [...] "Once you have uttered 'The Good,' add no further thought: by any addition, and {{in proportion to}} that addition, you introduce a deficiency." [...] Plotinus denies sentience, self-awareness or any other action (<b>ergon)</b> to the One [...] Rather, if we insist on describing it further, we must call the One a sheer potentiality (dynamis) or [...] without which nothing could exist. [...] As Plotinus explains in both places and elsewhere , {{it is impossible for}} the One to be Being or a self-aware Creator God. At , Plotinus compared the One to [...] "light", the Divine Nous (first will towards Good) to the [...] "Sun", and lastly the Soul to the [...] "Moon" [...] whose light is merely a [...] "derivative conglomeration of light from the 'Sun'". The first light could exist without any celestial body.|$|E
60|$|This was {{his first}} song, {{but it was not}} allowed to be his last. German ballads, Italian Opera airs, were all just as warmly, and perhaps far more {{sincerely}} appreciated, as they would have been by any London evening-party; and the singing went on, hour after hour, as we slipped slowly on upon the tide, till it grew late, and the sweet voices died away one by one; and then the Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity which had reigned so pleasantly throughout the day took a new form, as the women huddled together to sleep in each other's arms; and the men and we clustered forwards, while from every mouth fragrant incense steamed upwards into the air. 'Man a cooking animal?' my dear Doctor Johnson--pooh! man is a smoking animal. There is his <b>ergon,</b> his 'differential energy,' as the Aristotelians say--his true distinction from the ourang-outang. Ponder it well.|$|E
6000|$|... 92. [...] "[Greek: Aphaistou technaisi]." [...] Note {{that word}} of Pindar in the Seventh Olympic. This axe-blow of Vulcan's {{was to the}} Greek mind truly what Clytemnestra falsely asserts hers to have been [...] "[Greek: tês de dexias cheros <b>ergon</b> dikaias tektonos]"; physically, it meant {{the opening of the}} blue through the rent clouds of heaven, by the action of local {{terrestrial}} heat of Hephæstus as opposed to Apollo, who shines {{on the surface of the}} upper clouds, but cannot pierce them; and, spiritually, it meant the first birth of prudent thought out of rude labour, the clearing-axe in the hand of the woodman being the practical elementary sign of his difference from the wild animals of the wood. Then he goes on, [...] "From the high head of her Father, Athenaia rushing forth, cried with her great and exceeding cry; and the Heaven trembled at her, and the Earth Mother." [...] The cry of Athena, I have before pointed out, physically distinguishes her, as the spirit of the air, from silent elemental powers; but in this grand passage of Pindar it is again the mythic cry of which he thinks; that is to say, the giving articulate words, by intelligence, to the silence of Fate. [...] "Wisdom crieth aloud, she uttereth her voice in the streets," [...] and Heaven and Earth tremble at her reproof.|$|E
