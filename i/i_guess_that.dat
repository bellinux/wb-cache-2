25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E

She also discovered that young men, including her brothers, shared the feeling of shame over losing to girls. She recalls, 'Whenever my brother Paul, the youngest of my four brothers, beat me at pool on the table downstairs at home, he would run through the house shouting 'I won, I beat her'. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> was one reason I worked all the harder at my game.'" ...|$|E
500|$|After World War II, Jabara {{considered}} {{leaving the}} military to attend college, but later decided to attend the Tactical Air School at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida. From 1947 to 1949 he was stationed on Okinawa with the 53d Fighter Group. At Okinawa in 1948, Jabara flew his first jet aircraft, the [...] Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star. Reflecting on the transition to jet aircraft, he said [...] "It was entirely different. I was at 10,000 feet before I remembered to raise my landing gear. ...It was so quiet and fast. ...<b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> was probably the happiest moment of my life." [...] Jabara returned to the United States and was assigned as a flight commander, now at the rank of captain, with the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing, flying the newly operational North American F-86 Sabre jet fighter at the New Castle County Airport in Delaware.|$|E

500|$|During Howard's solo concerts from 1983to 1999, [...] "Shivers" [...] was {{the song}} most {{requested}} by audience members. However, {{by the time}} of his final tour in 2009—the year he died—he had stopped receiving requests for it. In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce myself from the song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt. And <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> is a strange way to feel about a song you wrote, so yeah, I am happy to not have to do it these days".|$|E
500|$|On August 28, 1974, Louis Peraino of Bryanston {{agreed to}} {{distribute}} the film worldwide, from which Bozman and Skaaren would receive $225,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted) and 35% of the profits. Years later Bozman stated, [...] "We {{made a deal with}} the devil, , and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that,</b> in a way, we got what we deserved." [...] They signed the contract with Bryanston and, after the investors recouped their money (with interest),—and after Skaaren, the lawyers, and the accountants were paid—only $8,100 (about $ inflation-adjustedn) was left to be divided among the 20 cast and crew members. Eventually the producers sued Bryanston for failing to pay them their full percentage of the box office profits. A court judgment instructed Bryanston to pay the filmmakers $500,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted), but by then the company had declared bankruptcy. In 1983 New Line Cinema acquired the distribution rights from Bryanston and gave the producers a larger share of the profits.|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, Rap-Up {{originally}} {{reported the}} song as [...] "Turn Off", while Hilson was playing it at Interscope-Geffen-A Records' second annual [...] "Creme of the Crop" [...] post-BET Awards dinner on June 25, 2008. Then an unmastered version of [...] "Turn Off" [...] was leaked online in September 2008. After selecting the predominantly pop-sounding [...] "Energy" [...] and [...] "Return the Favor", Hilson selected [...] "Turnin Me On" [...] as In a Perfect World...s third single. When asked {{in an interview}} with That Grape Juice if choosing the song was a conscious effort, since the song had a different sound than the previous singles, Hilson responded, [...] "Absolutely! I mean, there’s another side of me. I’m from Decatur, Georgia and that is a predominantly black neighbourhood with a lot of lower-class and some middle-class neighbourhoods. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> is the song that probably properly describes the type of girl I am, in relation to where I’m from. So yeah, it was definitely a conscious effort to make sure that I stay close to home on some records." ...|$|E

500|$|Salvatore created Drizzt on {{the spur}} of the moment. He was under {{pressure}} to create a sidekick for Wulfgar in the Icewind Dale series. Salvatore had sent an early version of The Crystal Shard (what would become his first published novel) to TSR, and one day Kirchoff called him. She was on her way to a marketing meeting concerning the book, and informed him that they could not use one of the characters. He asked for time to think, but she was already late for the meeting. Off the top of his head, Salvatore said he had a Dark Elf. Kirchoff was skeptical, but Salvatore convinced her it would be fine because he was just a sidekick. She asked his name, and he replied Drizzt Do'Urden. She asked if he could spell it, and he said [...] "not a chance". Recalling Drizzt's creation in an interview, Salvatore said, [...] "I don't know where it came from. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> Gary Gygax just did such an amazing job in creating the drow elves that something about them got stuck in the back of my head. Thank God!" [...] Although many readers have assumed that Drizzt is based on one of the many Dungeons & Dragons role-playing campaigns that the author has played, this is not the case. Salvatore's main influences were classical literature and works of J. R. R. Tolkien. [...] "I like to think of Drizzt as a cross between Daryth from Darkwalker on Moonshae and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings." [...] Salvatore calls Drizzt [...] "the classic romantic hero—misunderstood, holding to a code of ideals even when the going gets tough, and getting no appreciation for it most of the time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Early {{reviews of}} the HP TouchPad were mixed. David Pogue of The New York Times wrote, [...] "It works beautifully, and conveys far more {{information}} than the iPad 2.

It's around the same weight as the iPad, but you'd {{think it would be}} lighter because the back was made of plastic. That said, it's not overly heavy, just heavier than you'd think by looking." [...] Matt Buchanan, also writing for Gizmodo, praised the OS interface concept as 'good conceptually' but described the performance as [...] "slow motion... give this thing six months. It could be amazing. If it's not by then, well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> says everything that needs to be said."

But judging by the single cover, her place doesn't look too hopeless, does it? Maybe there's a building on fire outside the frame, and that fire hydrant doesn't work. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> would be hopeless."

2500|$|In {{their earlier}} appeals, {{the defense was}} limited to the trial record. The Governor's Committee, however, was not a {{judicial}} proceeding, so Judge Thayer's comments outside the courtroom could be used to demonstrate his bias. Once Thayer told reporters that [...] "No long-haired anarchist from California can run this court!" [...] According to the affidavits of eyewitnesses, Thayer also lectured members of his clubs, calling Sacco and Vanzetti [...] "Bolsheviki!" [...] and saying he would [...] "get them good and proper". During the Dedham trial's first week, Thayer said to reporters: [...] "Did you ever see a case in which so many leaflets and circulars have been spread...saying people couldn't get a fair trial in Massachusetts? You wait till I give my charge to the jury, I'll show them!" [...] In 1924, Thayer confronted a Massachusetts lawyer at Dartmouth, his alma mater, and said: [...] "Did you see what I did with those anarchistic bastards the other day. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>that</b> will hold them for a while.... Let them go to the Supreme Court now and see what they can get out of them." [...] The Committee knew that, following the verdict, Boston Globe reporter Frank Sibley, who had covered the trial, wrote a protest to the Massachusetts attorney general condemning Thayer's blatant bias. Thayer's behavior both inside the courtroom and outside of it had become a public issue, with the New York World attacking Thayer as [...] "an agitated little man looking for publicity and utterly impervious to the ethical standards one has the right to expect of a man presiding in a capital case." ...|$|E
