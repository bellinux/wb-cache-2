The Vietnam People's Army responded by moving its troops to areas attacked by Kampuchea and, on 7 June 1977, Vietnam proposed high-level talks to discuss outstanding issues. On 18 June 1977, the Kampuchean Government replied by demanding that Vietnam remove all of its military units from the disputed areas, and create a <b>demilitarised</b> <b>zone</b> between the opposing forces.|$|E
5|$|Sydney left Fremantle on 27 October 1953 for {{a second}} {{deployment}} to Korea, to support United Nations enforcement of the July 1953 armistice. This deployment, which concluded in January 1954, was mostly uneventful compared to the first, with flight operations limited to patrols along the <b>demilitarised</b> <b>zone</b> established by the armistice. During operations in Korea, one pilot died when his Sea Fury crashed into the ocean, while another pilot was killed and an aircraft handler seriously injured in separate deck accidents. Sydney returned to Fremantle on 2 June 1954. A planned upgrade of Sydney to a similar standard as modified sister ship Melbourne was cancelled in 1954, and she was prepared for service as a training ship. The carrier's embarked aircraft were flown off {{for the last time}} on 22 April 1955, and Sydney underwent a brief reorganisation during 26–29 April before she departed for New Zealand waters on her first training cruise on 2 May.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{armistice}} both sides withdrew and a <b>demilitarised</b> <b>zone</b> was created. The period that followed proved uneventful, yet the UN forces {{were required to}} maintain combat readiness {{and the ability to}} react quickly in case the North Koreans violated the ceasefire. In April 1954, 2 RAR returned to Australia and was replaced by 1 RAR which remained in South Korea until March 1956. 3 RAR finally returned to Australia in September 1954 after four years of continuous service in Korea and five years before that in Japan. Total Army casualties in Korea included 293 killed, 1,210 wounded and 23 captured, the majority being infantrymen of the Royal Australian Regiment. The fighting in Korea provided the regiment with valuable combat experience, establishing a foundation for its further development and marking the emergence of the Australian Regular Army. The Korean War remains the only large-scale, conventional war that the regiment has fought. During this time the Army developed the capability to maintain two battalions on major operations at the same time.|$|E

25|$|Fighting {{a mobile}} guerrilla war {{much of the}} time, the VC/NVA could not deploy large {{quantities}} of heavy artillery or tanks. Exceptions were the set piece siege battles such as the battle of Khe Sanh or heavy artillery duels against US batteries across the <b>Demilitarised</b> <b>Zone.</b> It was only after the shift to conventional warfare in the 1972 Easter Offensive, and the final conventional campaign in 1975 (when US airpower had vacated the field) that tanks and heavy batteries were openly used in significant numbers. When using heavy artillery, the VC/NVA relied on high quality Soviet-supplied heavy 122mm and 130mm guns that outranged American and ARVN opposition.|$|E
25|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the USSR, tensions between Moldova and the breakaway Transnistrian territory escalated into a military conflict that started in March 1992 and was concluded by a ceasefire in July of the same year. As part of that agreement, a three-party (Russia, Moldova, Transnistria) Joint Control Commission supervises the security arrangements in the <b>demilitarised</b> <b>zone,</b> comprising twenty localities {{on both sides of the}} river. Although the ceasefire has held, the territory's political status remains unresolved: Transnistria is an unrecognised but de facto independent semi-presidential republic with its own government, parliament, military, police, postal system, currency and vehicle registration. Its authorities have adopted a constitution, flag, national anthem, and coat of arms. It is the only country still using the hammer and sickle on its flag.|$|E
25|$|On 29 November 1952, U.S. President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower {{fulfilled}} {{a campaign}} promise {{by going to}} Korea {{to find out what}} could be done to end the conflict. With the UN's acceptance of India's proposal for a Korean armistice, a cease-fire was established on 27 July 1953, by which time the front line was back around the 38th parallel, and so a <b>demilitarised</b> <b>zone</b> (DMZ) was established around it, defended by North Korean troops on one side and by South Korean, American and UN troops on the other. The DMZ runs north of the parallel towards the east, and to the south as it travels west. The site of the peace talks, Kaesong, the old capital of Korea, was part of the South before hostilities broke out but is currently a special city of the North. North Korea and the United States signed the , which Syngman Rhee refused to sign.|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} few decades a number of {{initiatives}} have been undertaken {{both inside and outside the}} UN to establish Zones of Peace (ZOP) in various parts of the globe. Currently, there are seven declarations and proposals for ZOP relative to the Indian Ocean, the South Atlantic, the South Pacific, the Mediterranean, Southeast Asia, Nepal and Tibet. On the basis of the areas they cover and the legal issues they raise, the first four zones are termed in this thesis 'maritime zones of peace 1 and the remaining three 'land zones of peace'. The State practice relative to such zones demonstrates a significant move towards the acceptance of a variety of methods of creating different regimes with differing legal content. Yet there has been very little academic discussion on this subject from a legal point of view. Therefore, this thesis is designed to examine the legal aspects of the concept of ZOP. This study begins by examining the State practice on maritime ZOP and looks at whether the concept of maritime ZOP is consistent with the existing principles of international law, especially the freedom of the seas, and whether the State practice on ZOP has crystallised into a rule of customary international law. In doing so, it will assess the legal status of the UN General Assembly declarations on maritime ZOP. This is followed by an examination of the proposals for land ZOP. The study then assesses the extent to which the principles underlying the traditional concepts such as neutrality or <b>demilitarised</b> <b>zones,</b> as well as similar emerging principles, could be applied to the concept of ZOP. Another line of enquiry pursued in this thesis is into the concept of objective regimes in international law. After establishing that there exists in international law a rule on objective regimes, this thesis argues that the regimes of ZOP can be regarded as candidates for objective regimes. It is asserted that the methods applied to the creation of various ZOP are among the internationally accepted methods of creating regimes of a dispositive character and the regime of ZOP is similar to other regimes which have generally been regarded as objective regimes in international law. This thesis finds that although the ZOP is a distinct notion developed in response to the peculiar problems of a single State or a territorial entity or a geographical region, it draws upon similar traditional doctrines as well as other emerging rules of international law. On the whole, the declarations on ZOP can be viewed as innovative methods designed to consolidate the already extant and the emerging rules of international law, accord concrete meaning to certain general principles and apply them in the ZOP concerned. </p...|$|R
25|$|After the 1948–49 Arab-Israeli War, the Golan Heights were partly demilitarised by the Israel-Syria Armistice Agreement. During the {{following}} years, the area {{along the border}} witnessed thousands of violent incidents; the armistice agreement was being violated by both sides. The underlying causes of the conflict were a disagreement over {{the legal status of}} the <b>demilitarised</b> <b>zone</b> (DMZ), cultivation of land within it and competition over water resources. Syria claimed that neither party had sovereignty over the DMZ. Israel contended that the Armistice Agreement dealt solely with military concerns and that she had political and legal rights over the DMZ. Israel wanted to assert control up till the 1923 boundary in order to reclaim the Hula swamp, gain exclusive rights to Lake Galilee and divert water from the Jordan for its National Water Carrier. During the 1950s, Syria registered two principal territorial accomplishments: it took over Al-Hammah enclosure south of Lake Tiberias and established a de facto presence on and control of eastern shore of the lake.|$|E
500|$|Germany reoccupied the <b>demilitarised</b> <b>zone</b> in the Rhineland in March 1936, in {{violation}} of the Versailles Treaty. Hitler also sent troops to Spain to support General Franco during the Spanish Civil War after receiving an appeal for help in July 1936. At the same time, Hitler continued his efforts to create an Anglo-German alliance. In August 1936, in response to a growing economic crisis caused by his rearmament efforts, Hitler ordered Göring to implement a Four Year Plan to prepare Germany for war within the next four years. The plan envisaged an all-out struggle between [...] "Judeo-Bolshevism" [...] and German national socialism, which in Hitler's view required a committed effort of rearmament regardless of the economic costs.|$|E

As the territory was part of Germany, the British and French governments did not feel that attempting to enforce the treaty was worth the risk of war. In the one-party election held on 29 March, the NSDAP received 98.9 percent support. In 1936, Hitler signed an Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan and a non-aggression agreement with the Fascist Italy of Benito Mussolini, who was soon referring to a [...] "Rome-Berlin Axis".|$|E
500|$|During {{the action}} the Chinese had {{attempted}} to make a breakthrough to the Imjin River along the divisional boundary between the US 1st Marine Division and the 1st Commonwealth Division in order to turn the Marine division's flank. [...] Yet with well-coordinated indirect fires from the divisional artillery, including 16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery, and support from British Centurion tanks of the 1st Royal Tank Regiment, 2 RAR successfully thwarted both assaults, holding a key position known as The Hook. It was estimated that Chinese casualties numbered between 2,000 and 3,000 killed, {{with the majority of}} them inflicted by the New Zealand gunners. Meanwhile, on the left flank, US Marines had endured the brunt of the attack, repelling the Chinese onslaught with infantry and artillery.

A similar process occurred across the entire front. Meanwhile, {{under the terms of}} the agreement all prisoners who wished to be repatriated were to be returned, and 12,773 UN and 75,000 Chinese and North Korean prisoners were subsequently exchanged during this period, including 21 Australians and one New Zealander.

2500|$|While {{negotiating}} the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Israel {{called for the}} removal of all Syrian forces from the former Palestine territory. Syria refused, insisting on an armistice line based not on the 1923 international border but on the military status quo. The result was a compromise. Under the terms of an armistice signed on 20 July 1949, Syrian forces were to withdraw east of the old Palestine-Syria boundary. Israeli forces were to refrain from entering the evacuated areas, which would become a <b>demilitarised</b> <b>zone,</b> [...] "from which the armed forces of both Parties shall be totally excluded, and in which no activities by military or paramilitary forces shall be permitted." [...] Accordingly, major parts of the armistice lines departed from the 1923 boundary and protruded into Israel.

2500|$|During the Yom Kippur War in 1973, Syrian forces overran {{much of the}} {{southern}} Golan, before being pushed back by an Israeli counterattack.

East of the 1974 ceasefire line lies the Syrian controlled part of the Heights, an area that was not captured by Israel (500 square kilometres or 190 sq mi) or withdrawn from (100 square kilometres or 39 sq mi). This area forms 30% of the Golan Heights. Today it contains more than 40 Syrian towns and villages. In 1975, following the 1974 ceasefire agreement, Israel returned a narrow <b>demilitarised</b> <b>zone</b> to Syrian control.

2500|$|The {{attempted}} French re-colonization of Vietnam following World War II {{culminated in}} a decisive French defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu.

A Conference Final Declaration, issued by the British chairman of the conference, provided that a general election be held by July 1956 to create a unified Vietnamese state. Although presented as a consensus view, this document was not accepted by the delegates of either the State of Vietnam or the United States. In addition, China, the Soviet Union and other communist nations recognized the North while the United States and other non-communist states recognized the South as the legitimate government. By the time Westmoreland became army commander in South Vietnam, the option of a Korea-type settlement with a large <b>demilitarised</b> <b>zone</b> separating north and south, favored by military and diplomatic figures, had been rejected by the US government, whose objectives were to achieve a decisive victory, and not to use vastly greater resources.
