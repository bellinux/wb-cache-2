This, {{the first of its kind}} in the UK, comprises dust data from British Standard 1747 four-way directional gauges, a window ledge sampler and an experimental frisbee <b>deposit</b> <b>gauge.</b> X-Ray diffraction was used to characterize the dust on the basis of mineralogy.

For 18 months, a total of 15 directional nd three frisbee gauges were used to collect dust on and around the Ffos Las opencast coal site in South Wales, UK. Additionally, two more directional gauges have been installed in the Brecon Beacons and at Exeter in south-west England to provide data from outside the coal mining area.

At each site, a single dry Frisbee (with foam insert) dust <b>deposit</b> <b>gauge</b> was used to monitor dustfall on a monthly basis. Of the annual mean dustfall rates for the fives sites closest to Drax Power Station, three (Cliffe, Hemingbrough and particularly Camblesforth) significantly exceeded that for the background site (at Smeaton).

Because fugitive dust emissions are often episodic, it can be more useful to look at monthly dustfall results. The ‘likelihood of complaint ’ concept was used to rate nuisance potential of the dust by comparing monthly results with background data collected at Smeaton over the last eight years. During 2003, the monthly average ‘complaints likely ’ criterion of 89 mg m- 2 day- 1 was exceeded at one site on two occasions (Camblesforth, in April and August) and the ‘complaints possible ’ criterion of 81 mg m- 2 day- 1 was exceeded on a further six occasions (Barlow in August...|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: pages 151 - 159. The spatial {{distribution}} of trace elements in Pretoria is investigated by reference to the concentrations of lead, iron, manganese, zinc and copper in Jacaranda leaf samples. Different methods of sample preparation and analysis are examined. The variation in the trace element concentrations on a leaf and within a tree; temporal variations (daily and monthly); spatial variations (along a road, in different land-use zones); {{and the effect of}} meteorological variables (rain and wind) are investigated. Differences between the results from two annual surveys, the distributions and anomalies for each of the examined elements are discussed. The relationship between results from leaf and adjacent air-filter and/or <b>deposit</b> <b>gauges</b> is examined. The linear regression equations for lead, iron, manganese and zinc are used to simulate the atmospheric concentrations of these elements. The application of leaf sampling to augment and clarify the results from the existing Pretoria atmospheric monitoring network is discussed. It is concluded that the technique can be successfully applied to determine the distributions of trace elements in Pretoria. There is little variation in the concentrations of zinc and copper. The high leaf lead concentrations are found in the City centre and at points of traffic convergence. Anomalies of manganese occur in the southern suburbs, probably derived from the soil, and for iron {{to the west of the}} City centre, the possible source of which is industrial activity. The influence of Iscor, the iron and steel works, to the west of Pretoria is clearly shown by the distribution of iron in Pretoria. The comparison with the results from the <b>deposit</b> <b>gauges</b> is poor. The correlation between the air-filter and leaf results is particularly good for lead and iron. The simulated distributions of lead and zinc are very similar, suggesting that traffic is the source of both. Of the existing atmospheric monitoring stations in Pretoria the site at Munitoria is located in a position well within the overall central area exhibiting the highest lead, iron and zinc concentrations. It is concluded that additional atmospheric monitoring sites are required to determine the sources of the anomalies for iron and manganese, the existence of which were unknown prior to this study...|$|R

In 2008 there were 97. 9 million tons of wasted generated, among which 93 million tons industrial waste were produced. 64. 1 % of industrial wastes were deposited in the landfill sites. Dust generation {{is one of the}} most important problems associated with industrial waste and landfills. The particulate dust emissions come from the industrial waste may contain heavy metal and produce environmental problems and potential health risks. Active and passive samplers, deposition pans are common equipment to collect dust samples. Real-time monitors use laser diffraction to recording continuous dust concentration. Dust emission from Malmberget mine in Sweden was analyzed as a case study. Dust was collected by NILU <b>deposit</b> <b>gauge</b> from 26 stations. Generally speaking the amount of dust fallout was decreasing with time because of implemented dust control methods. During the period August 2009 to August 2010, among all the measuring stations through the year, the maximum and the minimum value were 1284 g/ 100 m 2 / 30 d and 9 g/ 100 m 2 / 30 d. Two sources of dust generation were identified. The first was located close to the open pit, and the second near the current mining industrial center.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This work {{reports the}} {{deposition}} onto high voltage insulators and correlation to atmospheric corrosivity measurement. This work includes corrosion studies at 15 sites in New Zealand (1, 816 tests) for {{in excess of}} 12 months, and co-operative research in South Africa. In addition, to confirm the relevance and transportability of this proposed model, {{a review of the}} published international data on deposition rates on insulators was conducted. It was noted that the deposition rate of airborne pollutants onto a surface is dependent upon the true surface area facing the wind and the aerodynamic properties of the surface. Such is the effect that surfaces with minimal exposure to the wind such as horizontal plates, {{have been shown to be}} poor collectors of deposits while vertical plates are more efficient, followed by high voltage glass insulators, the ISO 9223 salt candle, and the largest collector is the Direct Dust <b>Deposit</b> <b>Gauge.</b> This study found that the ISO 9223 wet salt candle and the average annual deposition rate on the High Voltage Glass insulator bottom surface (unenergized) provided relatively similar deposition results. The deposition onto insulator surfaces may be a more relevant method as it replicates deposition on large surfaces. This Equivalent Salt Dry Deposition (ESDD) method for HV insulators is an all inclusive measure of the airborne pollutants deposition rate and converts the total deposited material into a single value equivalent to that of salt, even though the deposit may consist of sulphur, marine salts, nitrates, and other conductive pollutants. The measured deposition rate on the sheltered insulator bottoms at 85 sites around the world predicted 87 % of the ISO corrosivity categories (based on zinc corrosion) for these sites. Results from equatorial Asia appear to be non-compliant and warrant further investigation. The ESDD values are now being quoted from around the world, by electrical engineers who use the recently revised CIGRE methodology, to determine the probability of arc-over (shorting to earth) of high voltage cables due to pollution build-up on insulators. The implications from this research are significant, with the cost of atmospheric corrosivity studies becoming prohibitively expensive, this method converts technically valid surface deposition results from the electrical engineers from around the world (provided at no cost), to valid empirical corrosivity rates from often remote locations...|$|E
40|$|Pressure {{measurement}} using {{a strain}} gauge bonded with epoxy adhesive to a metallic mechanical support has been, and still is, extensively employed, however, for some applications {{the use of}} an epoxy is inadequate, especially when temperatures exceed 120 C. There is therefore particular interest in the use of thin film techniques to vacuum <b>deposit</b> strain <b>gauges</b> directly on metallic substrates. Such devices are highly cost effective when produced in large quantities due to the manufacturing techniques involved. This makes them ideally suited for use in large-volume products such as electronic weighing scales and pressure transducers. In this thesis, new techniques for fabricating thin film vapour <b>deposited</b> strain <b>gauge</b> transducers on metal substrates for application as novel pressure sensors in the fastener industry are developed. Clearly, for a vapour <b>deposited</b> strain <b>gauge</b> to function correctly, it is essential that it be deposited on a defect free, high quality electrically insulating film. This was a significant challenge in the present study since all available physical vapour deposition (PVD) equipment was direct current (DC) and insulators of around 4 um thick were needed to electrically isolate the strain gauges from metal. As a result, several methods of depositing insulators using DC were developed. The first involved the use of DC magnetron sputtering from an aluminium target to reactively deposit up to 4 um thick AlN. DC magnetron discharges suffer arc instability as the AlN forms on the target and this limits the maximum thickness that can be deposited. Consequently, the arc instability was suppressed manually by increasing argon gas flow at the onset of arcing. Although the deposited AlN showed a high insulating resistance, {{it was found that the}} breakdown voltage could significantly increase by (a) utilising a metallic interlayer between the thin film insulator and the metallic substrate and (b) annealing in air at 300 C. A second deposition method involved the use of DC magnetron sputtering to deposit modulated thin film insulators in which an aluminium target was used to reactively deposit alternating layers of aluminium nitride and aluminium oxide. These films showed significant increases in average breakdown voltage when the number of layers within the composite film was increased. The third method involved the deposition of AlN thin film insulators using partially filtered cathodic arc evaporation with shielding. Initially, AlN was deposited under partially filtered conditions to obtain a relatively thick (~ 4 um) coating then, while still depositing under partially filtered conditions, a smooth top coating was deposited by using a shielding technique. The deposition of metal macroparticles is an inherent problem with cathodic arc deposition and shielding is one form of macroparticle filtering. Such particles are highly undesirable in this study as they are electrically conductive. A fourth coating technique for depositing insulators on steel was based on thermal spray technology. Insulating films of Al 2 O 3 were plasma sprayed and then polished to thereby fabricate viable electrical insulators for vapour <b>deposited</b> strain <b>gauges.</b> With respect to <b>depositing</b> strain <b>gauges</b> two methods were employed. The first involved the sputter deposition of chromium through a shadow mask to form a strain gauge with gauge factor sensitivity of around 2. The second used cathodic arc evaporation to fabricate a multi-layered strain gauge composed of alternating CrN and TiAlN layers that yielded a gauge factor of around 3. 5. The technique achieves better compatibility between gauge and insulator by allowing a wider selection of materials to form the gauge composition. Finally, a novel pressure sensor in the form of a load cell was developed that consisted of a chromium strain gauge on a steel washer electrically insulated with AlN thin film. The load cell showed good performance when tested under compressive load...|$|R

40|$|A cross {{sectional}} study {{was carried out}} to determine whether schoolchildren in a specific locality exposed to pollution from steam coal dust have an excess of respiratory symptoms compared with children in control areas. A total of 1872 primary schoolchildren (aged 5 - 11 years) from five primary schools in the Bootle dock area of Liverpool (exposed area), five primary schools in South Sefton (control area), and five primary schools in Wallasey (control area) were studied. A questionnaire was distributed through the schools and was completed by {{the parents of the}} children. The questionnaire inquired about respiratory symptoms (cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath), allergy, atopy, smoking, and socioeconomic factors. Height, weight, and peak expiratory flow were measured. Compliance was good (92 %) and similar in the three study areas. The children in the three areas were of similar mean age (7. 5 years), height (1. 24 m), sex ratio, and had a similar prevalence of paternal (6. 2 %) and maternal (7 %) asthma. The exposed zone contained more unemployed parents (41, 29, and 29 % respectively), more rented housing (64, 45, 34 %), and more smoking parents (71, 60, 59 %) than the control areas. Respiratory symptoms were significantly more common in the exposed area, including wheeze (25. 0, 20. 6, and 17. 5 %), excess cough (40. 0, 23. 4, and 25. 1 %), and school absences for respiratory symptoms (47. 5, 35. 9, and 34. 9 %). These differences remained significant even if the groups were subdivided according to whether or not parents smoked or were employed. Multiple logistic regression analysis confirmed the exposed zone as a significant risk factor for absenteeism from school due to respiratory symptoms (odds ratio 1. 55, 95 % confidence interval 1. 17 to 2. 06) after adjusting for confounding factors. Standard dust <b>deposit</b> <b>gauges</b> on three schools confirmed a significantly higher dust burden in the exposed zone.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented here}} was the response to an improvement condition issued by the Environment Agency. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine the potential effects of the particulate emissions from an integrated iron and steel works, to an adjacent sand dune ecosystem, identified as a Site of Special Scientific Importance (SSSI) for its flora, fauna and bird life. A monitoring and assessment of the deposition and flux of particulates was undertaken from April 2006 to September 2007 at monitoring sites located on the iron and steel works and in the surrounding area. A passive particulate deposition and flux monitoring study was undertaken at six sites on and surrounding the integrated iron and steel works using Frisbee <b>deposit</b> <b>gauges</b> and sticky pads. The deposition and flux of particulates was significantly higher at the monitoring sites located on or close to the works, and decreased up to 3 km from the works. The particles found on and near the works were predominately iron-rich, and most likely to be a result of emissions from the works. The chemical characteristics of the particles identified further away from the works were more diverse, and a combination of marine, soil, combustion or industrially derived particles. A desk-top review and development of the model scenario was undertaken, to assess the relevance of the modelled scenarios of PM(_ 10) emissions, to the total dust deposited to the passive deposition gauges. The model scenario was found to be an important qualitative tool, but could not be used to predict quantitative measurements of particulate deposition due to the limitations and uncertainty of modelling. The deposition of particulates to the SSSI was significantly higher at sites located closer to the works, and increased significantly with exposure time. The iron concentration of the soil was found to be significantly higher on the SSSI than at a sand dune ecosystem 3. 5 km away. Cleaned leaves of Leymus arenarius and Plantago lanceolata had a significantly higher rate of photosynthesis compared to untreated leaves growing on the SSSI. Therefore at sites where the rate of particulate deposition was relatively higher, and increased soil iron concentration was enhanced in comparison to similar sites, the rate of photosynthesis was significantly reduced in leaves of Leymus and Plantago on the SSSI...|$|R

40|$|Acoustic flow-meters are gauging devices {{commonly}} used in urban hydrology. Many of them {{are based on the}} Doppler principle and their use is based on the hypothesis that the velocity of suspended particles is equal to the flow velocity. Thus, at least a small amount of backscattering particles (or bubbles) is required for the use of acoustic Doppler velocimeters. In the same time, due to thermal conductivity and viscosity effects, the intensity of an ultrasonic wave propagating in an homogeneous medium decreases. In suspension an additional attenuation due to scattering and absorption by particles contribute to the intensity decay. This term depends on the particles nature and concentration. There is a complete lack of data for runoff and wastewaters. Moreover the density of the particles ranges between 1. 03 and 1. 3 and their granulometry is roughly known. In order to quantify the attenuation by wastewaters solids, an experimental set-up has been developed. The attenuation measurement for various types of particles is presented. It appears that the attenuation of the ultrasonic beams by the particles in suspension within the wastewaters, at the common wastewaters concentration, is negligible and that most of the observed attenuation is due to <b>deposit</b> on the <b>gauges</b> within the water column...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{innovative}} approach to measuring intraluminal {{pressure in the}} upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, especially monitoring GI motility and peristaltic movements. The proposed approach relies on thin-film aluminum strain <b>gauges</b> <b>deposited</b> {{on top of a}} Kapton membrane, which in turn lies on top of an SU- 8 diaphragm-like structure. This structure enables the Kapton membrane to bend when pressure is applied, thereby affecting the strain gauges and effectively changing their electrical resistance. The sensor, with an area of 3. 4 mm 2, is fabricated using photolithography and standard microfabrication techniques (wet etching). It features a linear response (R 2 = 0. 9987) and an overall sensitivity of 2. 6 mV mmHg− 1. Additionally, its topology allows a high integration capability. The strain gauges’ responses to pressure were studied and the fabrication process optimized to achieve high sensitivity, linearity, and reproducibility. The sequential acquisition of the different signals is carried out by a microcontroller, with a 10 -bit ADC and a sample rate of 250 Hz. The pressure signals are then presented in a user-friendly interface, developed using the Integrated Development Environment software, QtCreator IDE, for better visualization by physicians.

40|$|The {{market for}} organic foods is growing, however, the {{proportion}} of consumers buying organic foods is still considered low. Research shows that a significant barrier to consumers purchasing more organic foods is lack of information. This leads the relevant body of research to call for better communication around organic foods. The same body of research, however, neither questions what good communication surrounding organic foods is, nor what would make it better. Applying the communication theoretical formats of transmission, interaction, and coaction, respectively, onto instances of organic communication activities, I will discuss to what extent each format encourages consumer participation and learning. Transmission, typically {{in the form of}} monologuous mass communication, is cost effective. It is also a format that bars a sender, e. g., producer or farmer, from <b>gauging</b> <b>deposits</b> in the consumer, e. g., understanding the message, trusting the sender, etc. Interaction, typically in the form of dialoguous encounters, integrates feedback into communication allowing the sender to appreciate the level of understanding, trust, etc., which the communicative effort has given rise to, albeit at a higher price in terms of money, time, and manpower. In the format of coaction, typically in the form of co-operative endeavors, the deposit is a matter of what is coconstructed by the participants, e. g., understanding, trust, etc. Coaction thus satisfies the organic communicators craving for involving the consumer, and because food is a low-involvement commodity, this is critical. But emancipating the consumer comes at a price. First of all, coactional communication is dependent on highly motivated participants, and second, coactional communication is difficult if not impossible to control. Informed by these insights, I present an in-depth, critical discussion of the promises and pitfalls of how multicriteria assessments may be communicated and coconstructed on a coactional, web-based platform...|$|R
40|$|The {{excellent}} {{electrical and}} mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) provide interesting opportunities to realize {{new types of}} strain gauges. However, there are still challenges for the further development of CNT film strain gauges, for instance the lack of design rules, the homogeneity, stability and reproducibility of CNT films. This thesis aims {{to address these issues}} from two sides: simulation and experiment. Monte Carlo simulations show that both the sheet resistance and gauge factor of CNT films are determined essentially by the two-dimensional exclude area of CNTs. It was shown, for the first time, that the variation of the CNT film gauge factor follows the percolation scaling law. The sheet resistance and gauge factor both have a power-law divergence when approaching the percolation threshold. The standard deviation of film resistances, however, also increases correspondingly. These findings of simulations provide a general guide to the tailoring of material property of CNT films in strain sensing applications: a compromise should be made between the reproducibility, conductivity and sensitivity of CNT films depending on application purposes. From the experimental side, the processing parameters for the preparation of CNT dispersions were first investigated and optimized. The reproducibility of the film resistance is significantly improved by selecting a suitable sonication time. In strain measurements it was found that for most CNT films the film resistance responses nonlinearly to the applied strain. The dependence of the film resistance on the strain can be roughly divided into two regions with nearly linear behavior respectively. The gauge factor varies with the quality of CNTs and the <b>depositing</b> method. A <b>gauge</b> factor up to 8 was achieved in the high strain region. The nonlinear response behavior was found in simulations when the CNT waviness is properly taken into account. To achieve a high gauge factor and simultaneously retain the high conductivity and reproducibility, good-quality MWCNTs were integrated in polyethylene oxide (PEO). A high gauge factor up to 10 was achieved for the composite film with CNT weight fraction of 2. 5 %. The resistance and gauge factor can be tuned by changing the MWCNT weight fraction with respect to PEO. A careful comparison of simulation and experiment results show that a good qualitative agreement can be achieved between them in many respects...|$|R
40|$|Fugitive {{dust from}} {{industrial}} activities is a long-standing and intractable problem. Quarrying and mining, construction and demolition, landfill, waste transfer and reprocessing, bulk materials handling (especially at ports, docks and harbours), and arable farming are obvious examples where dust is inevitably produced. The impacts of dust emissions from such activities are broadly recognised but, especially within crowded {{urban and suburban}} areas where industry and residential areas are often juxtaposed, there may be many potential dust sources within and beyond any given locality. Consideration of potential fugitive dust impacts from planned industrial sites is a frequent part of environmental and social impact assessment, and subsequent monitoring of dust emissions a necessary test enforced by legislation and/or best practice guidance. Rarely, but in such cases significantly, disputes may arise about the causes and consequences of dust impacts. These can become good examples for environmental forensics, requiring the constraint of source - pathway - receptor with sufficient robust evidence for responsibilities to be established and decisions to be made. Recent developments in passive (unpowered) dust monitoring utilising ‘sticky pad’ samplers (Datson et al., 2011; 2012) have facilitated the monitoring of dust in flux on the pathway between source and receptor, and in deposition at the receptor. When combined with established procedures for elemental analysis (Fowler et al., 2010), source attribution studies become possible. This contribution describes two examples of such work which have been undertaken {{on behalf of the}} UK Environment Agency (EA), one related to hazardous waste disposal at a rural landfill site, the other to varied industrial activity in an urban setting. Both studies follow the same overall rationale and use DustScan® monitoring equipment and methods. Briefly, after careful consideration of site circumstances and potential dust sources, directional and/or <b>deposited</b> dust <b>gauges</b> are located between the site and potential receptor(s), and at ‘proxy’ receptor locations. Where possible, an upwind location is included, to help establish the local background dust abundance and character. Guided by the directional dust monitoring data (dust abundance by direction as AAC (absolute area coverage) and/or EAC (effective area coverage)), sub-samples are excised from “arcs of interest” on the sticky pads – each representing the direction that connects source and receptor, to a 15 ˚ resolution. Sub-samples are also taken from sticky pads used to capture dust in deposition, according to an appropriate and similar logic. These are then subjected to a range of laboratory analyses depending on purpose (and finance), ranging from light and scanning electron microscopy, gravimetry and granulometry, to elemental analysis by ICPAES or ICP-MS. Elemental data form the basis of source attribution, either by judgemental establishment of dust differences based on knowledge of potential source(s), or - if the data set is appropriate - by multivariate statistics and/or chemical mass balance procedures. The first case study (hazardous waste landfill) was commissioned as part of the planning application process for renewal of the site licence. It demonstrates that with sufficient prior knowledge and comparatively simple site circumstances, it is possible to make confident apportionment conclusions based on relatively few samples. The second study reflects work in progress at a more complex site involving several industrial processes, including waste transfer, metals recycling, roadstone coating and waste incineration. It shows that, again with a modest number of samples, sensible constraints can be placed on the potential origin of fugitive dusts and their dispersal into the local environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{market for}} organic foods is growing, the {{proportion}} of consumers buying organic foods is, nevertheless, still considered to be low. Relevant research continuously shows {{that one of the}} most significant barriers prohibiting consumers from purchasing (more) organic foods is lack of information. Both with regards to organic foods as such as well as to the additional qualities of organic foods compared to conventionally produced foods. This has led the relevant body of research to rally behind a generic call for better organic communication. The same body of research, however, seems to take for granted what makes communication good and that we all agree on what communication is. Within the context of this paper, these underlying assumptions will be challenged from both a theoretical and a practical perspective. With a point of departure in communication theory’s credo-like statement that any model of communication is also a model for communication, I will demonstrate that and how the communicative approach one favors, when communicating about organic foods, critically influences the consumer impact of any instance of organic communication. Applying the communication theoretical formats of transmission, interaction and co-action respectively unto instances of organic communication activities, I will discuss and evaluate to what extent each format encourages participation and learning on the side of the consumer. From these discussions stem several insights: Whereas transmission (typically in the form of monologuous mass communication) is the cost-effective format of choice in much organic communication, it is also a format which bars a sender (e. g., producer or farmer) from <b>gauging</b> <b>deposits</b> in the consumer (be it in the form of understanding the message or trusting the sender for that matter). The format of interaction (typically in the form of dialoguous encounters of different kinds) integrates feedback into communication, thereby allowing the sender to appreciate the level of understanding, trust etc. which the communicative effort has given rise to – albeit at a higher price in terms of money, time and manpower. Last but not least, in the format of co-action (typically in the form of co-operative endeavors) the deposit is a matter of what is co-constructed by the participants – be it understanding or trust or the like. Needless to say, this format satisfies the organic communicators craving for involving the consumer to a much larger degree than the other two formats could ever do; and due to the fact that food is generally seen as a low-involvement commodity, this is critical. But emancipating the consumer, so to speak, comes at a price. First of all, co-actional communication is crucially dependent on highly motivated participants and, secondly, co-actional communication is difficult if not impossible to control...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of flow {{separation}} is very essential for proper understanding of both {{external and internal}} aerothermodynamics of bodies. Because of unique flow features such as thick boundary layers, merged shock layers, strong entropy layers, {{flow separation}} in the flow field of bodies at hypersonic speeds, is both complex as well as interesting. The problem of flow separation is further complicated at very high stagnation enthalpies because of the real gas effects. Notwithstanding the plethora of information available in open literature even for simple geometric configurations the experimentally determined locations of flow separation and re-attachment points do not match well with {{the results from the}} computational studies even at hypersonic laminar flow conditions. In this backdrop the main aim of the present study is to generate a reliable experimental database of classical separated flow features around generic configurations at hypersonic laminar flow conditions. In the present study, flow visualization using high speed camera, surface convective heat transfer rate measurements using platinum thin film sensors, and direct skin friction measurements using PZT crystals have been carried out for characterizing the separated flow field around backward facing step, double cone and double wedge models. The numerical simulations by solving the Navier-Stokes equations have also been carried out to complement the experimental studies. The generic models selected in the present study are simple configurations, where most of the classical hypersonic separated flow features of two-dimensional, axi-symmetric and three dimensional flow fields can be observed. All the experiments are carried out in IISc hypersonic shock tunnel (HST 2) at Mach 5. 75 and 7. 6. For present study, helium and air have been used as the driver and test gases respectively. The high speed schlieren flow visualization is carried out on backward facing step (2 and 3 mm step height), double cone (semi-apex angles of 150 / 350 and 250 / 680) and double wedge (semi-apex angles of 150 / 350) models by using high speed camera (Phantom 7. 1). From the visualized shockwave structure in the flow field the flow reattachment point after separation has been clearly identified for backward facing step, double cone and double wedge models at hypersonic Mach numbers while the separation point could not be clearly identified because of the low free stream density in shock tunnels. However the flow visualization studies helped clearly identifying the region of flow separation on the model. Based on the results from the flow visualization studies both the physical location and distribution of platinum thin film gauges was finalized for the heat transfer rate measurements. Surface heat transfer rates along the length of two backward facing step (2 and 3 mm step height) models have been measured using platinum thin film <b>gauges</b> <b>deposited</b> on Macor substrate. The Eckert reference temperature method is used along the flat plate for predicting the heat flux distribution. Theoretical analysis of heat flux distribution down stream of the backward facing step model has been carried out using Gai’s dimensional analysis. The study reveals {{for the first time that}} at moderate stagnation enthalpy levels (~ 2 MJ/kg) the hypersonic separated flow around a backward facing step reattaches rather smoothly without any sudden spikes in the measured values of surface heat transfer rates. Based on the measured surface heating rates on the backward facing step, the reattachment distance was estimated to be approximately 10 and 8 step heights downstream of 2 and 3 mm step respectively at nominal Mach number of 7. 6. Convective surface heat transfer experiments have also been carried out on axi-symmetric double cone models (semi-apex angles of 15 / 35  and 25 / 68 ), which is analogous to the Edney’s shock interactions of Type VI and Type IV respectively. The flow is unsteady on the double cone model of 25 / 68  and measured heat flux is not constant. The heat transfer experiments were also carried out on the three-dimensional double wedge model (semi-apex angles of 15 / 35 ). The separation and reattachment points have been clearly identified from the experimental heat transfer measurements. It has been observed that the measured heat transfer rates on the double wedge model is less than the double cone model (semi-apex angles of 150 / 350) for the identical experimental conditions at the same gauge locations. This difference could be due to the three-dimensional entropy relieving effects of double wedge model. PZT- 5 H piezoelectric based skin friction gauge is developed and used for direct skin friction measurements in hypersonic shock tunnel (HST 2). The bare piezoelectric PZT- 5 H elements (5 mm × 5 mm with thickness of 0. 75 mm) polarized in the shear mode have been used as a skin friction gauge by operating the sensor in the parallel shear mode direction. The natural frequency of the skin friction sensor is ~ 80 kHz, which is suitable for impulse facilities. The direct skin friction measurements are carried out on flat plate, backward facing step (2 mm step height) and double wedge models. The measured value of skin friction coefficient (integrated over an area of 25 sq. mm; sensor surface area) at a distance of 23 mm from the leading edge of the sharp leading edge backward facing step model is found to be ~ 0. 0043 while it decreases to ~ 0. 003 at a distance of 43 mm from the leading edge at a stagnation enthalpy of ~ 2 MJ/kg. The measured skin friction matches with the Eckert reference temperature within ± 10 %. The skin friction coefficient is also measured on the double wedge at a distance of 73 mm from the tip of the first wedge along the surface and is found to be 4. 56 × 10 - 3. Viscous flow numerical simulations are carried out on two-dimensional backward facing step, axi-symmetric double cone and three-dimensional double wedge models using ANSYS-CFX 5. 7 package. Navier-Stokes Simulations are carried out at Mach 5. 75 and 7. 6 using second order accurate (both in time and space) high resolution scheme. The flow is assumed to be laminar and steady throughout the model length except on the double cone (semi-apex angles of 250 / 680) model configuration, which represents the unsteady flow geometry. Analogous Edney Type VI and Type IV shock interactions are observed on double cone, double wedge (semi-apex angles of 150 / 350) and double cone (semi-apex angles of 250 / 680) models respectively from the CFD results. Experimentally measured convective heat transfer rates on the above models are compared with the numerical simulation results. The numerical simulation results matches well with the experimental heat transfer data in the attached flow regions. Considerable differences are observed between the measured surface heat transfer rates and numerical simulations both in the separated flow region and on the second cone/wedge surfaces. The separation and reattachment points can be clearly identified from both experimental measurements and numerical simulations. The results from the numerical simulations are also compared with results from the high speed flow visualization experiments. The experimental database of surface convective heating rates, direct skin friction coefficient and shockwave structure in laminar hypersonic flow conditions will be very useful for validating CFD code...|$|R
