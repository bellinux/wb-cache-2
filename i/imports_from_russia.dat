25|$|Chinese <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia</b> {{are mainly}} those of energy sources, such as crude oil, which is mostly transported by rail, and {{electricity}} exports from neighboring Siberian and Far Eastern regions. In the near future, exports {{of both of}} these commodities are set to increase, as Russia is building the Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean oil pipeline with a branch going to the Chinese border, and Russian power grid monopoly UES is building some of its hydropower stations {{with a view of}} future exports to China.|$|E
25|$|Poland {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on coal for electrical generation. Unlike in most of Western Europe, Polish coal mines are still active. Methane in the mine workings poses safety problems. Most methane is currently treated as waste, but studies show that coalbed methane can be profitably used as a gas resource. As of 2010, Poland imports two-thirds of its natural gas from Russia. Tapping shale gas resources would greatly boost Poland's proven reserves, and lessen the importance of gas <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Armenia {{does not}} have any fossil-fuel reserves, so it relies on gas <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia</b> and Iran, and nuclear fuel <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia,</b> which, together, result in {{approximately}} 66% of electricity production. Armenia is a net-producer of electricity and has exported in excess of 1.3 billion kWh per year since 2014 to Iran, Georgia, and Nagorno-Karabakh.|$|E
50|$|Coal is <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia</b> and Poland. 5.6 {{million tonnes}} {{were used in}} 2007.|$|R

50|$|The China Railways FD {{class of}} {{locomotives}} were 2-10-2 steam locomotives of the Russian FD locomotive type <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia</b> and regauged {{for use in}} China.|$|R
50|$|Some of Robinson Armament's {{better known}} {{products}} include the Stoner 63 derived M96 Carbine, and the Kalashnikov based Vepr series of weapons which are <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia.</b>|$|R
50|$|The FD class {{locomotives}} were <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia</b> <b>from</b> 1958 {{to provide}} main line freight motive {{power for the}} Chinese railways. Over 1000 units were acquired and remained in service until 1985.|$|R
5000|$|The largest {{importers}} of Russian {{gas in the}} European Union are Germany and Italy, accounting {{together for}} {{almost half of the}} EU gas <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia.</b> Other larger Russian gas importers (over 5 billion cubic meter per year) in the European Union are France, Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland, Austria and Slovakia. [...] The largest non-EU importers of Russian natural gas are Ukraine, Turkey and Belarus.|$|E
5000|$|Slovenia and Russia are {{traditionally}} strong economic partners. This applies {{not only to}} the inter-state relations but also to the ties between regions. The level of economic exchange between Slovenia and various Russian regions is constantly growing. Such growth is supported by agreements on cooperation, joint ventures and business delegations. Russia is steadily in top ten trade partners of Slovenia and exports from this Alpine Republic substantially overweigh <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia.</b>|$|E
50|$|At {{the annual}} level {{exchange}} of goods between two states is about $1.8 billion. Russia is the fifth largest economic partner of Croatia. In 2012, Croatian exports to Russia totaled $312 million. Croatia exports mainly drugs, shaving products, flasks for metal foundry, electrical transformers and generating sets, while Russia exports oil, oil and petroleum gases, accounting 90 percent of <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia</b> to Croatia, mineral and chemical fertilizers, aluminum wrought and boilers for steam production.|$|E
50|$|The reactor is a Light Water tank type WWR 2 MW {{research}} reactor {{with an initial}} fuel load of 3.2 kg 10% enriched uranium U235 (EK-10) <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia,</b> since then the reactor had never been refueled.|$|R
5000|$|The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives {{classified}} the 7N6 cartridge as [...] "armor piercing handgun ammunition" [...] on 7 April 2014, and, as such, it {{is illegal}} to <b>import</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia</b> to the United States.|$|R
50|$|Most {{species are}} declining or {{endangered}} through habitat loss and hunting, even {{where they are}} nominally protected. The last bustard in Britain died in approximately 1832, but the bird is being reintroduced through batches of chicks <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After {{weeks of}} {{disputes}} {{the head of}} Gazprom Alexei Miller {{and the head of}} Naftohaz Ukrainy Oleh Dubyna signed the 10-year agreement on natural gas supplies to Ukraine for the period of 2009-2019 on 19 January 2009. [...] It was agreed that RosUkrEnergo will no longer supply all of Ukraine's natural gas <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia</b> and other Central Asian countries. A claim of a $600 million debt of Naftohaz to RosUkrEnergo was also dropped.|$|E
50|$|Georgian Natural gas {{consumption}} stood at 1.8 billion cubic meters in 2007. Natural gas {{used to be}} supplied to Georgia by Russia. In recent years, however, Georgia {{has been able to}} eliminate its dependency on <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia,</b> thanks to increased hydroelectricity production, and the availability of natural gas sources from Azerbaijan. In addition, all Russian gas exports to Armenia pass through the Georgian pipeline system. Georgia takes 10% of that gas as a transit fee.|$|E

25|$|Instead of coal, {{electricity}} {{is generated by}} burning oil shale, with largest stations in Narva. Oil shale supplies around 70% of the country's primary energy. Other energy sources are natural gas <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia,</b> wood, motor fuels, and fuel oils.|$|R
50|$|Russian Blue breeders from The International Cat Association (TICA), however, {{objected to}} this, and the breed {{standard}} was thus revised {{to describe a}} unique breed, resembling blue-grey cats that had been <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia</b> in the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries.|$|R
50|$|Coal {{consumption}} in 2012 grew to 61.207 million tonnes, up 6.2% compared with 2011. Most {{is used for}} public utilities and for power generation. However local coal only provides 50% of the country’s electricity needs, therefore requiring Ukraine to <b>import</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia</b> and Poland.|$|R

50|$|The {{energy sector}} is {{dominated}} by state-owned companies such as Termoelectrica, Hidroelectrica and Nuclearelectrica. Fossil fuels are the country's primary source of energy, followed by hydroelectric power. Due to dependency on oil and gas <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia,</b> the country has placed an increasingly heavy emphasis on nuclear energy since the 1980s. The Cernavodă Nuclear Power Plant is currently {{the only one of}} its kind in Romania, although there are plans to build a second one in Transylvania, possibly after 2020.|$|E
50|$|Germany's {{network of}} natural gas {{pipeline}}s, on the other hand, is dense and well-connected. Imported pipeline gas comes mostly from Russia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Although gas <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia</b> have been historically reliable, even during the cold war, recent price disputes between Gazprom and the former Soviet states, such as Ukraine, have also affected Germany. As a result, high political importance {{is placed on the}} construction of the Nord Stream pipeline, running from Vyborg in Russia along the Baltic sea to Greifswald in Germany. This direct connection avoids third-party transit countries.|$|E
50|$|The railway of {{the company}} was nationalized on October 1, 1906 under the Railway Nationalization Act. At this time the company was renamed Hokkaido Colliery & Steamship Co., Ltd. (Hokkaidō Tankō Kisen), which {{continued}} mining until 1995 and is in business of coal <b>importing</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia</b> as of 2014.|$|R
50|$|As of 2015, the {{excise tax}} rates on tobacco {{products}} {{were due to}} meet the minimum rates required by the European Union by 2018. The relatively low rates in Lithuania are mostly driven {{by the presence of}} a significant black market for cigarettes, which are illegally <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia</b> and Belarus.|$|R
50|$|Armenian mines produce copper, zinc, gold, and lead. The vast {{majority}} of energy is produced with fuel <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia,</b> including gas and nuclear fuel (for its one nuclear power plant); the main domestic energy source is hydroelectric. Small deposits of coal, gas, and petroleum exist but {{have not yet been}} developed.|$|R
50|$|Until recently, Russia was Ukraine's largest {{trading partner}} with 25.7% of exports and 32.4% of imports in 2012. In 2012, 24.9% of exports and 30.9% of imports were {{to and from}} the EU. In 2013, 35.9% of Ukrainian exports went to CIS countries, {{including}} eight countries other than Ukraine. Simultaneously, exports to EU countries, of which there are twenty-eight, was 26.6%. By 2015 the EU became Ukraine's largest trading partner, accounting for {{more than a third of}} its trade. In 2015 the Ukrainian export to Russia figure had fallen to 12.7%. In 2014 Ukraine imported 23.3% of all its <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{bilateral}} relations, however, {{were seriously}} affected in 2009 by external factors, namely {{the global financial}} and economic crisis led to the downturn of economic activities and lower consumption which, as a consequence, resulted in a significant down-slide in the trade between the two countries. The structure of the trade exchange during the crisis though remained largely the same - 60-70 % of Slovenian exports are pharmaceuticals, wired communications systems, electrical equipment, mechanical installations and paints. <b>Imports</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia</b> are mostly comprised by oil and gas products and their derivatives, aluminium products, together comprising 70-75 % of the total Russian import.|$|E
5000|$|Koreans {{have been}} enjoying Alaska pollock since the Joseon era. One of the {{earliest}} mentions are from Seungjeongwon ilgi (Journal of the Royal Secretariat), where a 1652 entry stated: [...] "The management administration should be strictly interrogated for bringing in pollock roe instead of cod roe." [...] Alaska pollock were the most commonly caught fish in Korea in 1940, when more than 270,000 tonnes were caught from the East Sea. The current annual consumption of Alaska pollock in South Korea {{is estimated to be}} about 260,000 tonnes in 2016. Nowadays, however, Alaska pollock consumption in South Korea relies heavily on <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia,</b> due to the rise in sea water temperatures.|$|E
50|$|The Orbital Sciences Antares light-to-medium-lift {{launcher}} has two modified NK-33 in {{its first}} stage, a solid second stage and a hypergolic orbit stage. The NK-33s are first <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia</b> to the United States and then modified into Aerojet AJ26s, which involves removing some harnessing, adding U.S. electronics, qualifying it for U.S. propellants, and modifying the steering system.|$|R
50|$|The Russian Federation {{supplies}} {{a significant}} volume {{of fossil fuels}} and is the largest exporter of {{oil and natural gas}} to the European Union. In 2007, the European Union <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> <b>Russia</b> 185 million tonnes of crude oil, which accounted for 32.6% of total oil import, and 100.7 million tonnes of oil equivalent of natural gas, which accounted 38.7% of total gas import.|$|R
