If the right of conquest belongs by right to the conquering country, {{it would be fair}} for Spain to quit resisting the French and submit to them, by the same principles for which it is expected that the Americans submit themselves to the peoples of Pontevedra. The reason and the rule must be equal for <b>everybody.</b> <b>Here</b> there are no conquerors or conquered; here there are only Spaniards. The Spaniards of Spain have lost their land. The Spaniards of America are trying to save theirs. Let the ones from Spain deal with themselves as they can; do not worry, we American Spaniards know what we want and where we go. So I suggest we vote: that we replace the Viceroy with a new authority that will be subject to the parent state if it is saved from the French, and independent if Spain is finally subjugated.|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{was long}} {{regarded}} as one of the great teammates in baseball. He was known as a leader in the clubhouse and a tutor to younger players. He mentored his successor in San Diego, Heath Bell, and the pitcher who supplanted him in Milwaukee, John Axford. [...] "Just watching him go about his business was a big thing to me", Bell said. In his first game pitching setup to Axford after losing his closer role, Hoffman stayed in the dugout to watch Axford finish. Many relievers retire back to the clubhouse after being removed from a game. Hoffman's teammates noticed that he stayed supporting Axford through a bases-loaded jam. Axford [...] spent the season absorbing Hoffman's advice, and the two bonded. [...] "He took young players under his wing, especially relief pitchers", said former Padres teammate Brad Ausmus. Hoffman regularly organized team dinners on the road or had team family gatherings at his home, whether it was with the Padres or the Brewers. [...] "It's very unusual for a pitcher, especially a relief pitcher, to be the team leader", Padres first baseman Phil Nevin said in 2002, [...] "but <b>everybody</b> <b>here</b> looks to Trevor. This is his team." ...|$|E

He then played Richard III, which Fincher said was [...] "great training". Spacey supported the decision to release all of the episodes at once, believing that this type of release pattern will be increasingly common with television shows. He said, [...] "When I ask my friends what they did with their weekend, they say, 'Oh, I stayed in and watched three seasons of Breaking Bad or it's two seasons of Game of Thrones". He was officially cast on March 18, 2011. Robin Wright was approached by Fincher to star in the series when they worked together in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. She was cast as Claire Underwood in June 2011. Kate Mara was cast as Zoe Barnes in early February 2012. Mara's sister, Rooney Mara, worked with Fincher in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and when Kate Mara read the part of Zoe, she [...] "fell in love with the character" [...] and asked her sister to [...] "put in a word for me with Fincher". The next month, she got a call for an audition.|$|E

2500|$|Roy Beck, whose 1.5-million-member {{organization}} NumbersUSA {{played a}} major role in defeating the Senate immigration bill, calls Huckabee [...] "an absolute disaster as governor of Arkansas... Every time there was any enforcement in his state, he took the side of the illegal aliens." [...] Huckabee responded by saying if voters are looking for the toughest guy on immigration, he's not their man. [...] Nevertheless, like many in the Republican party, Huckabee's position has evolved, particularly after the bruising immigration reform fight in the summer of 2007. [...] On December 6, 2007, he released a nine-point immigration enforcement and border security plan. [...] These were modeled on a ten-point plan proposed in 2005 by Mark Krikorian. [...] On January 16, 2008, Huckabee became the first presidential candidate to sign Americans for Better Immigration's No-Amnesty pledge. [...] In response, Roy Beck's organization raised his rating on illegal immigration to EXCELLENT. [...] Huckabee continues to speak for the dignity of legal immigrants. [...] In the January 10 Republican debate he said that all immigrants [...] "ought to live with their heads up.. We ought to have the assumption that <b>everybody</b> <b>here</b> is legal, that nobody here is illegal." ...|$|E
