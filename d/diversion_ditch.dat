40|$|Areal/Intensity Data: The {{project study}} area {{encompasses}} ca. 160 acres. The entire area was surveyed for cultural resources at 30 meter transect intervals. South {{of the principal}} east-west drainage, survey was accomplished in 38 linear north-south transects; on steep slopes north of the drainage (ca. 12 acres), 5 contour transects were surveyed. Project Description: Galactic Services, Inc., proposes to develop ore processing facilities (crusher, leach pads, topsoil stockpile) for its USX Mine. Additional support facilities, including leachate collection ditches, a surface <b>diversion</b> <b>ditch,</b> and a network of 30 ft. wide access roads, are planned. As presently designed, direct surface disturbance would be confined (with a one-acre exception) to {{that portion of the}} project area lying south of the east-west drainage. Statement of Purpose: Archaeological survey of the U. S. Steel West project area was conducted and reported by Budy (1988); since the present facilities are ancillary to that project, the present report constitutes an addendum to Budy's documentation, reporting the results of additional survey. Pains were taken to ensure that field survey methods, manner of recording, and site evaluation procedures were strictly comparable between the two studies in order to facilitate planning coordinated programs of archaeological testing and data recovery in both project areas.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the investigation was to confirm the presence and determine {{the location of a}} cache of 30 to 60 buried 55 -gallon drums that were allegedly dumped along the course of the pre-existing, northsouth <b>diversion</b> <b>ditch</b> (NSDD) adjacent to permitted landfills at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, Kentucky. The ditch had been rerouted and was being filled and re-graded {{at the time of the}} alleged dumping. Historic information and interviews with individuals associated with alleged dumping activities indicated that the drums were dumped prior to the addition of other fill materials. In addition, materials alleged to have been dumped in the ditch, such as buried roofing materials, roof flashing, metal pins, tar substances, fly ash, and concrete rubble complicated data interpretation. Some clean fill materials have been placed over the site and graded. This is an environment that is extremely complicated in terms of past waste dumping activities, construction practices and miscellaneous landfill operations. The combination of site knowledge gained from interviews and research of existing site maps, variable frequency EM data, classical total magnetic field data and optimized GPR lead to success where a simpler less focused approach by other investigators using EM- 31 and EM- 61 electromagnetic methods and unfocused ground penetrating radar (GPR) did not produce results and defined no real anomalies. A variable frequency electromagnetic conductivity unit was used to collect the EM data at 3, 030 Hz, 5, 070 Hz, 8, 430 Hz, and 14, 010 Hz. Both in-phase and quadrature components were recorded at each station point. These results provided depth estimates for targets and some information on the subsurface conditions. A standard magnetometer was used to conduct the magnetic survey that showed the locations and extent of buried metal, the approximate volume of ferrous metal present within a particular area, and allowed estimation of approximate target depths. The GPR survey used a 200 megahertz (MHz) antenna to provide the maximum depth penetration and subsurface detail yielding usable signals to a depth of about 6 to 10 feet in this environment and allowed discrimination of objects that were deeper, particularly useful in the southern area of the site where shallow depth metallic debris (primarily roof flashing) complicated interpretation of the EM and magnetic data. Several geophysical anomalies were defined on the contour plots that indicated the presence of buried metal. During the first phase of the project, nine anomalies or anomalous areas were detected. The sizes, shapes, and magnitudes of the anomalies varied considerably, but given the anticipated size of the primary target of the investigation, only the most prominent anomalies were considered as potential caches of 30 to 60 buried drums. After completion of a second phase investigation, only two of the anomalies were of sufficient magnitude, not identifiable with existing known metallic objects such as monitoring wells, and in positions that corresponded to the location of alleged dumping activities and were recommended for further, intrusive investigation. Other important findings, based on the variable frequency EM method and its combination with total field magnetic and GPR data, included the confirmation of the position of the old NSDD, the ability to differentiate between ferrous and non-ferrous anomalies, and the detection of what may be plumes emanating from the landfill cell...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} combat {{adverse effects of}} {{farmland}} degradation {{it is necessary for}} farmers to adopt sustainable land management and conservation strategies like intercropping and conservation tillage. However, efforts to adopt these strategies are very minimal in Ethiopia. In an attempt to address the objectives of examining factors affecting use of intercropping and conservation tillage practices, this study utilized plot- and household-level data collected from 211 farm households and employed a bivariate probit model for its analysis. The study revealed that intercropping and conservation tillage decisions are interdependent, and that they are also significantly affected by various factors. In addition, conservation tillage and intercropping practices as short- term interventions are found to augment the long-term interventions like terraces, <b>diversion</b> <b>ditches,</b> and tree plantations. The paper highlights important policy implications that are required to encourage intercropping and conservation tillage measures...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of these options demonstrates that {{the effectiveness of the}} phased construction is highly dependent on the size and location of each phase in relation to the site's subwatersheds and on the ability to keep the construction on schedule. For both options the phases are aligned approximately with watershed boundaries, therefore all sedimentation basins need to be built as in the standard case. In the case of the NS option basin Bd will be replaced by two smaller basins. Total sediment delivery will be reduced if each phase is disturbed for a shorter time than for the standard case. In our computations we assume that the entire construction will take 1 year for both the standard and phased construction, but for the phased construction, each phase will be disturbed only for half a year (Table 5). Under such conditions, the total sediment delivery can be reduced to 50 % of the sediment delivery for the standard scenario which is close to the estimates given in the report by CWP (1997). The additional cost for this approach includes a more complex network of <b>diversion</b> <b>ditches</b> needed to direct flow into the basins, idle time or re-mobilization cost of the heavy equipment and longer maintenance of the finished phase. There are also numerous site-specific issues related to this approach, such as balance in cut and fill for each phase, however, for our site, cu...|$|R
40|$|Lately, several {{researchers}} {{have pointed out}} that climate change is expected to increase temperatures and lower rainfall in Mediterranean regions, simultaneously increasing the intensity of extreme rainfall events. These changes could have consequences regarding rainfall regime, erosion, sediment transport and water quality, soil management, and new designs in <b>diversion</b> <b>ditches.</b> Climate change is expected to result in increasingly unpredictable and variable rainfall, in amount and timing, changing seasonal patterns and increasing the frequency of extreme weather events. Consequently, the evolution of frequency and intensity of drought periods is of most important as in agro-ecosystems many processes will be affected by them. Realising the complex and important consequences of an increasing frequency of extreme droughts at the Ebro River basin, our aim is to study the evolution of drought events at this site statistically, with emphasis on the occurrence and intensity of them. For this purpose, fourteen meteorological stations were selected based on the length of the rainfall series and the climatic classification to obtain a representative untreated dataset from the river basin. Daily rainfall series from 1957 to 2002 were obtained from each meteorological station and no-rain period frequency as the consecutive numbers of days were extracted. Based on this data, we study changes in the probability distribution in several sub-periods. Moreover we used the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for identification of drought events in a year scale and then we use this index to fit log-linear models to the contingency tables between the SPI index and the sub-periods, this adjusted is carried out with the help of ANOVA inference...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} local soil {{knowledge and}} {{management in the}} Manupali watershed in the Philippines. The study focuses on soil erosion and its control. Research methods {{used in the study}} include ethnosemantic elicitations on soils and focus group discussions. In addition, in-depth work was conducted with 48 farmers holding 154 parcels at different elevations/locations in the watershed. The on-parcel research consisted of farmer classifications of the soil, topography, and erosion status of their parcels. Soil samples were also taken and examined. Farming households were also examined with regard to erosion control activities conducted by age and sex. Erosion management was examined in relation to tenure of the parcel, which emerged as a salient aspect among focus group members and was evidenced by the actual control measures taken on farmed parcels. The results show that the major constraint in soil erosion management is not local knowledge {{as much as it is}} the tenure arrangements which allow "temporary owners" (those working rented or mortgaged parcels) to manage the parcels as they see fit. Most of these temporary owners are not willing to invest in erosion control measures other than water <b>diversion</b> <b>ditches.</b> Parcel owners, in contrast, do invest in longer term erosion control measures on the parcels they actually work. The findings of this paper illustrate that linking local knowledge and practices is often not sufficient in and of itself for addressing questions of sound environmental management. While local knowledge serves farmers generally well, there are some limitations. Importantly, the pressures in the contemporary world of markets and cash can undermine what they know as the right thing to do for the environment. </p...|$|R
40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the degree of Master of Water Resources, University of New Mexico July 15, 2002. The development of water resources {{is the most important}} issue facing water resource managers today, particularly in the U. S. southwest, where demand is far greater than water ground-water replenishment. Conjunctive-use strategies for water resource development, or the integration of surface and ground-water uses towards developing one or both of these reserves, were simulated in a static water balance model identifies strategies would increase annual changes in water storage hydrologic system by increasing the amount of water available for aquifer recharge in the South Valley Area (SVA) of Bernalillo County. The evaluation was accomplished by simulating increases and decreases in water inputs and outputs from existing infrastructure and land uses in the SV A, a subsection of the Middle Rio Grande Basin (MRGB). Average annual quantities were used to simulate current conditions in the MRGB. Projections for water demand for the next forty years were based on population growth estimates and previous demand projection studies. Strategies that increased the amount of ground-water recharge in the SVA and MRGB, include the City of Albuquerque's (COA) switch to surface water for its primary supply, the enhancement of seepage along Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District (MRGCD) conveyance canals, and the transfer of 25 percent (not including the consumptive-use of vegetation) of ground-water withdrawals for irrigation to surface <b>diversion</b> <b>ditches.</b> Management components of the conjunctive-use strategies were examined, providing examples of possible mechanisms that would promote the reallocation of surface water, requiring the transfer of water rights, to ensure that the water is allocated to the appropriate facilities and at the appropriate level to recharge the regional aquifer...|$|R
