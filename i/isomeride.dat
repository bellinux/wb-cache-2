40|$|As one of {{the most}} {{commonly}} employed UV-filters, 4 -methylbenzylidene camphor (4 -MBC) has been shown to accumulate in the environment and have endocrine disrupting activity. 4 -MBC cannot be degraded completely by common methods in wastewater treatment plants. To prevent the environmental problems caused by 4 -MBC from being more serious, finding effective method to degrade 4 -MBC is essential. In this research, Fenton reaction and photo-Fenton was employed to degrade the 4 -MBC. Orthogonal experimental design was employed to evaluate the influence of factors (Fe 2 +, H 2 O 2, pH and reaction time) on the degradation of 4 -MBC. The degradation rate reached to 66. 01 % in Fenton process and 96. 71 % in photo-Fenton process. UV light irradiation was also employed to degrade 4 -MBC. After being irradiated by mercury lamp (300 W) 90 min, the concentration of the 4 -MBC reduced 85. 4 %, but most of them translated to the <b>isomeride.</b> Compared with the Fenton, photo-Fenton and UV light irradiation processes, we deduces that photo-Fenton can get the better degradation efficiency of 4 -MBC, and, Fenton reagents and light irradiation are synergistic...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{view of the}} {{characteristics}} of oils from different production areas in the South Slope of Dongying Sag, detailed geochemical analysis of aromatic hydrocarbon in Es 4 extracts were conducted. The results show that some typical high plants -sourced compounds are widely spread, such as pyrene, benzopyrene, fluoranthene, chryaene, benzofluoranthrene, perylene and cadalene. The ratios of 1, 2, 5 -/ 1, 3, 6 -TMN are 0. 39 ∼ 1. 04, 9 -MP <b>isomeride</b> is in high content of 7. 02 - 12. 53 %, and about 0. 05 %∼ 14. 50 % of retene is detected, suggesting the Es 4 extracts are typical terrestrial origin. In F-DBF-DBT series, dibenzothiophene(DBT) is dominated with content of 33. 07 - 73. 17 %, while dibenzofurane(DBF) is 9. 56 - 33. 20 %, showing a reduction condition of brackish-saline lake. Furthermore three types of depositional environment can be distinguished according to the reduction intensities. The RICs are characterized by double peak with tricyclic aromatic compounds in predominance, ratios of 2, 3, 6 -/(2, 3, 6 + 1, 2, 5) -TMN are 0. 37 - 0. 64, MPI 1 and MPI 2 are 0. 21 - 0. 61 and 0. 24 - 0. 72 respectively, corresponding to the maturity of 0. 53 - 0. 77 %Rc, indicating a mature stage...|$|E
40|$|Of the {{explanations}} put {{forward of the}} change in rotatory power which glucose undergoes in solution— a phenomenon discovered by Dubrunfaut in 1846 — the most probable is that suggested by Lowry (Trans., 1899, 75, 213), which connects the change of rotatory power of glucose with a reversible isomeric change. When this explanation was first given, {{it was not possible to}} decide definitely what formulae were to be assigned to the dynamic <b>isomerides.</b> In view, however, of observations made during the investigation of various glucoside derivatives (Fischer and Armstrong, Ber., 1901, 34, 2885; 1902, 35, 833, 3144 and 3153), in the course of which the existence of two un­ doubtedly stereoisomerie series of glucose derivatives was discovered and their relationship to the α- and β-methylglucosides established, it now seems probable that a lactonic structure may be assigned to the isomeric glucoses: these <b>isomerides</b> are, in fact, the two possible stereoisomeric lactones.

40|$|Bilirubinoide in the feces {{of various}} {{patients}} was separated by column chromatography. And {{the results were}} as follows. 1. Bilirubin and urobilin could {{be separated from the}} feces of various patients, but other bilirubinoide was only identified by the absorption curves because of the scanty dosis. 2. Bilirubin, mesobilirubin, dihydromesobilirubin and urobilin were separated from the feces of 6 cases in the 8 cases with the administration of antibiotics for a long period, and bilirubin, dihydrobilirubin, mesobilirubin and urobilinogen in other one case and bilirubin, dihydromesobilirubin in another case. 3. In the above 2 cases with the administration of antibiotics, mesobilirhodin and mesobiliviolin were identified in the mixture of urobilin, but each fraction of them could be scarcely separated. Since dihydromesobilirubin was separated at that time, it was thought that mesobilirhodin and mesobiliviolin were produced by the oxydation of dihydromesoblilirubin during the separation process. Therefore, it was thought that dihydromesobilirubin produced in the intestine was composed of two <b>isomerides.</b> 4. The formation of urobilinogen in the intestine was supposed to take the same reduction process of bilirubin by colloidal palladium in vitro...|$|R
40|$|The indigo group includes, in {{addition}} to indigotin and its derivatives, a variety or structurally related compounds, several of which, like the prototype are commercially important vat dyes. They are reducible {{by virtue of the}} carbonyl groups to dihydroxy compounds; these form water-soluble salts from solutions of which textile fibers can be impregnated with the reduced or “leuco” compound (generally colorless or much less highly colored than the parent), which is readily oxidized to reproduce the dye deposited in the textile material. The methods that are or have been applied technically to the manufacture of indigo depend for the main part on the production of indoxyl or indoxylic acid (indolin- 3 -one- 2 -carboxylic acid) with subsequent oxidation to indigotin by air or an oxidizing agent such as ferric chloride. The various derivatives of indigotin include N-derivatives, derivatives of the carbonyl function, homologs such as 5, 5 '-dimethylindigo, halogenoindigos, dehydroindigo, leuco-indigo (indigo-white) and polycyclic indigos. The position <b>isomeride,</b> indirubin, is present in small quantities in synthetic indigotin, and in larger and varying amounts in the natural dye; it is unlikely that it contributes significantly to the tinctorial properties of the coloring matter.

30|$|As {{illustrated}} in Figure  1, {{there are four}} endothermic peaks on the DSC curve of cupric tartrate. This indicates that the decomposition of cupric tartrate may be a complex process and proceed in several steps, which is in good agreement {{with the results of}} Schmid and Felsche [27] who used the same heating rate as our experiments. Schmid and Felsche found that decomposition of cupric tartrate produced numerous of species, including CH 2, H 2 O, CO, C 2 H 2, CH 2 O, O 2, C 2 H 2 O, CO 2, C 2 H 2 O 2, C 2 H 4 O 2, C 2 H 2 O 3, C 4 H 4 O 4, and C 4 H 4 O 6. As for this experiment, the exothermic peaks at 245.6 °C and 294.6 °C are most likely due to the conversion of C 4 H 4 O 62 − into an <b>isomeride</b> with a hexatomic ring and the oxidation of Cu species, respectively [27]. The decomposition of tartrate diradical to C 2 H 2 O 3 could be the origin of the endothermic peak at 261.0 °C. Further decomposition of C 2 H 2 O 3 to formaldehyde and CO 2 may be responsible for the endothermic peak at 271 °C. The endothermic peak at 282.1 °C {{may be due to the}} decomposition of C 4 H 4 O 62 − to C 4 H 4 O 4 and O 2. The endothermic peak at 306.3 °C may be resulted from the decomposition of C 4 H 4 O 4 to CH 2, H 2 O, CO, C 2 H 2, and CH 2 O.|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of {{independent}} investigations in these Laboratories, studies have {{been made of the}} products resulting from the carbonation of the Grignard reagent derived from crotyl and methylvinylcarbinyl bromides. At the University of California, Los Angeles, this work was carried out as part of an extensive program of research {{on the nature of the}} allylic Grignard reagent and its reactions with a variety of substances. The approach, therefore, was one which gave detailed attention to all of the products formed in the reaction. On the other hand, certain studies now in progress at Princeton University on the reactions of the isomeric olefinic acids R-CH=CH [...] CH_ 2 CO_ 2 H (I), R-CH-(CO_ 2 H) -CH=CH_ 2 (II), led to an investigation of the carbonation of allylic Grignard reagents with particular attention being focused on the acidic components of the reaction mixture, since it appeared that a convenient method of the synthesis for at least one and perhaps both of the <b>isomerides</b> I and II would be available if the reaction proved successful...|$|R
40|$|Investigations of (+) alphagamma-dimethylallyl alcohol led to {{the belief}} that an {{optically}} active product would be obtained when (-) alpha-phenyl-gamma-methylallyl alcohol (and its derivatives) was converted into alpha-phenyl-gamma-methylallyl alcohol (and its derivatives). This expectation has been fully realized; the hydrogen phthalic ester of alpha-phenyl-gamma-methylallyl alcohol changes into the isomeric ester containing 87 % of one optical enantiomorph. The transformation CHPhX. CH: CHMe → CHPh:CH. CHXMe also proves to be an exceptionally convenient anionotropic system for investigation since the more reactive esters of alpha-phenyl-gamma-methylallyl alcohol change into their <b>isomerides</b> at ordinary temperatures either in solution or (in the case of the hydrogen phtalio ester) in the crystalline state. By using optically active compounds this change can readily be followed polarimetrically, and thus a convenient and accurate method of studying the reaction is available. Like the hydrogen phthalio ester of alphagamma-dimethylallyl alcohol, esters of alpha-phenyl-gamma-methylallyl alcohol undergo conversion in methylalcoholic and acetic solution and yield respectively the methyl ether and the acetic ester of alpha-phenyl-gamma-methylallyl alcohol. Esters of alpha-phenyl-gamma-methylallyl alcohol undergo similar replacement reactions but much more slowly. On addition of bromine, (+) gamma-phenyl-alpha-methylallyl alcohol yields two methyl-alphabeta-dibromo-beta-phenylethyl oarbinols which may be separated by fractional crystallization. One of these, on oxidation, yields (+) methyl-alphabeta-dibromo [...] phenyl ethyl ketone, while the other gives the (-) -enantiomorph possessing numerically the same rotatory power. When bromine is Added to (+) gamma-phenyl-alpha-methylallyl and the mixture oxidised without any form of previous separation the resulting ketone is optically active. As the original centre of asymmetry in the compound has been destroyed by oxidation this reaction represents a new type of asymmetric synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Chemistry owes {{much to the}} {{catalytic}} {{forces which}} effect otherwise difficulty accomplished reactions. To catalysis Organic Chemistry owes the Grignard reagents, which have been employed not only for a multitude of simpler syntheses {{but also for the}} more complex syntheses of carbohydrates (Paal. Ber, 1905, 38 1656; 1906, 39, 1301, 2823, 2827) Frankland and Twiss J. C. S. 1905, 87, 864), of terpenss (Perkin J. C. S. 1907, 91, 480, Hesse Ber. 1909, 42, 1127, Mills and Bain J. C. S. 1910, 97, 1866) and of organo-silicon compounds (Kipping J. C. S. 1901 to 1909). Pope and Peachy effected resolutions of tin compounds with its aid. Chlorination is effected catalytically by suitable carriers. The Friedel and Crafte reaction is effected also by suitable halides. Numerous condensations such as the Benzoin condensation, the Aldol condensation, the Claisen condensation, and also esterification are catalytically effected. Equilibria between dynamic <b>isomerides,</b> in racemisation, and in mutarotation, are promoted by catalysis. Technical chemistry has, through catalysis, reversed the economic standing of nations. Cases in point are the synthesis of indigo, a stage in which is the catalytic oxidation of Napthalene by Sulphuric acid and Mercury, and the manufacture of sulphuric acids, of Ammonia and of Nitrates. The manufacture of synthetic petrols, power alcohols, and the new utilisations of coal depend entirely upon catalysts for their successful functioning. Analytical chemistry employs catalysts in processes of gas absorption such as addition of Uranyl Sulphate to Sulphuric Acid in the absorption of Ethylene (Lebeau and Damiens Compt. Rand. 1913, 156, 557) or of Corrosive Sublimate to alhaline Pyrogallol to accelerate the absorption of Oxygen. (Stassana, Compt. Rend. Soc. Biol. 1905, 58, 96). Also in Oxidation, such as the permanganate titration of iron in the presence of Hydrochloric and of Manganese Salts (Kessler. Pogg. Am. 1863, 118, 48; 119, 225), or the ability of Ferrous Sulphate to promote interaction between Potassium Persilphate and Potassium Iodide (Price Z Phys. Chem. 1898, 27, 474); and Reduction as in the employment of a Zinc-Copper Couple for the reduction of Chlorates to Chlorates (Thorpe and Eccles J. C. S. 1873, 26, 541; Bothamley and Thompson Ibid 1888, 53, 164). Catalysts are also employed in Organic analysis, as for example the use of colloidal platinum metals to convert Halogen compounds into Hydrogenated products and Halogen acid in the presence of Hydrogen (Borshe and Heimburger, Ber. 1915, 48, 452, 850). In Inorganic Chemistry a large number of reactions are catalytically accelerated. One of the best known is the decomposition of Potassium Chlorate in the Presence of Manganese Dioxide. Numerous catalyses are cited in the work of Dhar. (Ann. Chim. 11, 130 - 223, 1919). Hydrogen peroxide, another example of classical importance in chemical kinetics is decomposed by numerous agents, such as glass wool, salts of heavy metals, colloidal platinum. In Electrochemistry one may cite such examples as the addition of Fluorides in the preparation of Persulphates or percarbonates, (Muller and Friedberger, Z. Elektrochem., 1902, 8, 230), or the use of Lead Peroxide anodes in the oxidation of Chromates to Dichromates (Z. Elektrochem, 1905, 11, 863). Para-nitrotoluene with platinum anodes yields p-nitro-benzoic acid almost quantitatively. An enormous number of reactions is accelerated by radiant energy, according to photo chemical laws. A typical example is the union of Hydrogen and Chlorine, whose mechanism has occupied the attention of numerous workers. The photocatalytic combination of carbon-monoxide and Chlorine, of Sulphur Dioxide and Chlorine, of saturated, unsaturated, and aromatic hydro-carbons, and of acids (much as Acetic acid) and Chlorine furnish still further examples. Such reactions are further sensitive to the presence of ordinary material catalysts or anti-catalysts (See Griffiths and McKeowan, (“Photochemistry” p. 626. ...|$|R
