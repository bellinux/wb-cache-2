40|$|International audienceIn honeybees, {{the rate}} at which a nectar forager unloads its crop to a {{receiver}} is positively correlated with the reward conditions the forager has recently experienced outside the hive. Food-receiver bees often share the nectar they have received with <b>hive</b> <b>mates.</b> A quantitative analysis of two consecutive trophallactic events was done in experimental arenas to determine if the food-transfer behavior of a food-receiver as she distributes nectar to her <b>hive</b> <b>mates</b> is affected by her prior trophallactic experience with a donor forager. We found that {{the rate at}} which a receiver unloads nectar to another receiver is positively correlated with {{the rate at which}} she received it from a food donor, suggesting {{that it is possible to}} propagate, through individual-to-individual interactions, information about quantitative aspects of the liquid food circulating among worker honeybees...|$|R
40|$|Floral scents are {{important}} information cues used to organize foraging-related tasks in honeybees. The waggle dance, apart from encoding spatial information about food sources, might facilitate {{the transfer of}} olfactory information by increasing the dissipation of volatiles brought back by successful foragers. By assuming that food scents are more intensive on specific body parts of returning foragers, i. e., the posterior legs of pollen foragers and mouthparts of nectar foragers, we quantified the interactions between <b>hive</b> <b>mates</b> and foragers during dances advertising different types of food sources. For natural sources, {{a higher proportion of}} <b>hive</b> <b>mates</b> contacted the hind legs of pollen dancers (where the pollen loads were located) with their heads compared to non-pollen dancers. On the other hand, the proportion of head-to-head contacts was higher for non-pollen foragers during the waggle runs. When the food scent was manipulated, dancers collecting scented sugar solution had a higher proportion of head-to-head contacts and a lower proportion around their hind legs compared to dancers collecting unscented solution. The presence of food odors did not affect in-hive behaviors of dancers, but it increased the number of trophallaxes in-between waggle runs (i. e., during circle phases). These results suggest that the honeybee dance facilitates the olfactory information transfer between incoming foragers and <b>hive</b> <b>mates,</b> and we propose that excitatory displays in other social insect species serve the same purpose. While recent empirical and theoretical findings suggested that the colony level foraging benefits of the spatial information encoded in the waggle dance vary seasonally and with habitats, the role of the dance as a compound signal not only indicating the presence of a profitable resource but also amplifying the information transfer regarding floral odors may be important under any ecological circumstances...|$|R
40|$|In honeybees, {{employed}} foragers recruit unemployed <b>hive</b> <b>mates</b> to {{food sources}} by dances {{from which a}} human observer can read the distance {{and direction of the}} food source(1). When foragers collect food in a short, narrow tunnel, they dance as if the food source were much farther away. Dancers gauge distance by retinal image flow on the way to their destination. Their visually driven odometer misreads distance because the close tunnel walls increase optic flow(2). We examined how <b>hive</b> <b>mates</b> interpret these dances. Here we show that recruited bees search outside {{in the direction of the}} tunnel at exaggerated distances and not inside the tunnel where the foragers come from. Thus, dances must convey information about the direction of the food source and the total amount of image motion en route to the food source, but they do not convey information about absolute distances. We also found that perceived distances on various outdoor routes from the same hive could be considerably different. Navigational errors are avoided as recruits and dancers tend to fly in the same direction. Reported racial differences in honeybee dances(1) could have arisen merely from differences in the environments in which these bees flew...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Transfer of {{information}} about food source characteristics within insect societies is essential to colo-ny-foraging success. The food odor communicated within honeybee hives {{has been shown to}} be important for food source exploitation. When successful foragers return to the nest and transfer the collected nectar to <b>hive</b> <b>mates</b> through mouth-to-mouth contacts (trophallaxis), potential recruits receiving these samples learn the food odor by associative learning. The food then becomes rapidly distributed among colony members, which is mainly a consequence of the numerous trophallaxes between hive-mates of all ages during food processing. We tested whether the distribution of food among <b>hive</b> <b>mates</b> causes a propagation of olfactory information within the hive. Using the proboscis extension response paradigm, we show that large proportions of bees of the age groups representing the main worker castes, 4 to 9 -day-old bees (nurse-aged bees), 12 to 16 -day-old bees (food processor-aged bees), and actual foragers (about 17 + day old bees) associatively learn the food odor in the course of processing food that has been collected by only a few foragers. Results further suggest that the information is shared more or less equally between bees of the three age groups. This shows that olfactory information about the flower species exploited by foragers is distributed within the entire colony and is acquired by bees of all age groups, which may influence many behaviors inside and outside the hive.

40|$|Abstract—In a bee colony, bees perform waggle {{dance in}} order to {{communicate}} the information of food source to their <b>hive</b> <b>mates.</b> This foraging behaviour has been adapted in a Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) algorithm together with 2 -opt local search to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) [1]. To reduce the high overhead incurred by 2 -opt in the BCO algorithm proposed previously, two mechanisms named frequency-based pruning strategy (FBPS) and fixed-radius near neighbour (FRNN) 2 -opt are presented. FBPS suggests that only a subset of promising solutions are allowed to perform 2 -opt based on the accumulated frequency of its building blocks recorded in a matrix. FRNN 2 -opt is an efficient implementation of 2 -opt which exploits the geometric structure in a permutation of TSP sequence. Both mechanisms are tested {{on a set of}} TSP benchmark problems and the results show that they are able to achieve a 58. 42 % improvement while maintaining the solution quality at 0. 02 % from known optimal.

40|$|The {{honeybee}} (Apis mellifera) waggle dance, {{which is}} performed inside the hive by forager bees, informs <b>hive</b> <b>mates</b> about a potent food source, and recruits them to its location. It {{consists of a}} repeated figure- 8 pattern: two oppositely directed turns interspersed by a short straight segment, the "waggle run". The waggle run consists of a single stride emphasized by lateral waggling motions of the abdomen. Directional information pointing to a food source relative to the sun's azimuth is encoded in the angle between the waggle run line and a reference line, which is generally thought to be established by gravity. Yet, there is tantalizing evidence that the local (ambient) geomagnetic field (LGMF) could play a role. We tested {{the effect of the}} LGMF on the recruitment success of forager bees by placing observation hives inside large Helmholtz coils, and then either reducing the LGMF to 2 % or shifting its apparent declination. Neither of these treatments reduced the number of nest mates that waggle dancing forager bees recruited to a feeding station located 200 m north of the hive. These results indicate that the LGMF does not act as the reference for the alignment of waggle-dancing bees...|$|R
50|$|After {{the nest}} is cleaned and built, the virgin queen leaves {{to find a}} mate.

The virgin queen leaves on her nuptial flight around 7 to 15 days old. In a few cases, queens go out on a second nuptial flight, mating with another male.|$|R
40|$|Left-right {{specialization}} {{of brain}} and behaviour {{is not unique}} property of vertebrates but has been recently observed in invertebrate species as well. Interestingly, a link between lateralization and sociality has been suggested, together with capabilities of mastering high cognitive tasks, at least among vertebrates. The study of invertebrates is important from an evolutionary and comparative perspective. In particular, honey bees are useful models to investigate the evolution of brain asymmetries and social traits. To date, though a lateralization has been revealed at the electrophysiological level in single individuals during olfactory processing, nothing is known about asymmetric bias and social behaviours. Here we report {{for the first time}} a strong lateral preference in honey bees to use their right antenna in social interactions with conspecifics. We analyzed different social behaviours (latency to contact, numbers of proboscis extension (PER), number of C-responses, number of mandibulations) in pairs of bees coming either from the same colony or from different colonies. We found a directional bias in the use of antennae for three measures of social interactions such as latency, PER, and C-responses. In particular in bees with only right antennae social behaviour is more context-appropriate compared to left antennae bees, the later possibly due to an impairment in distinguishing between <b>hive</b> <b>mates</b> and bees from another hive. This highlights a direct association of lateral biases during social interactions in honey bees and raises the question whether it might have evolved as a putative adaptation to eusocialit...|$|R
50|$|Species {{that attack}} bees {{typically}} {{lay their eggs}} on flowers. There the eggs hatch almost immediately into small planidial larvae and lie in wait for a visiting host. The planidium mounts the bee and rides {{it back to the}} hive. There it dismounts and seeks a cell occupied by a host larva. The planidium then enters the body of the host. It changes its skin and shape, then remains more or less dormant until the host larva pupates. It then emerges from the bee pupa and begins to feed. It eats the entire pupa, then pupates in its turn and completes its metamorphosis before emerging from the <b>hive</b> to <b>mate</b> and lay eggs.|$|R
40|$|Three {{methods of}} {{introducing}} virgin queens into <b>mating</b> <b>hives</b> {{were compared with}} the standard method of using a "ripe" queen cell. Virgins were introduced into queenless <b>mating</b> nucleus <b>hives</b> (5 -frame medium Langstroth) using a wooden mailing cage with candy and attendant bees and were released three days later. When the caged virgins were 0 - 1 days old when introduced, the proportion giving rise to an egg-laying queen (65 %) was almost as high as with cells (70 %) (P = 0. 63, test). Success dropped to 55 % (P = 0. 04) for 3 - 4 day old virgins. If the virgin was introduced into a queenright <b>mating</b> <b>hive</b> for three additional days before the colony queen was removed the success rate was only 29 % (P = 0. 001). Across all methods, most queen loss occurred in the introduction/emergence period, with only one third in the mating period.

50|$|Eggs {{are laid}} in the abdomen of the bee, when the larvae hatch they feed on flight muscles in the thorax and hemolymph. Development of larvae takes an average of a week, mature fly larvae {{typically}} emerge from the host between the head and thorax (but rarely result in decapitation), and pupate outside the host body. About 28 days are needed for the entire life cycle to take place. Infected bees can be found walking in circles, as well as losing the ability to stand, disorientation is likely caused by mechanical interference or by pressure of the growing larvae on the internal organs and nervous system. Inactivity during the daytime, along with activity during cold or inclement weather has been observed in infected bees. Hive abandonment, particularly at night has been implicated as a behavior modification of A.borealis. Reasons for abandoning the hive remain unclear. Researchers have hypothesized that infected bees may be ejected by their <b>hive</b> <b>mates,</b> {{with the possibility of}} chemosensory particles playing a role in detection of infected bees. It is also possible that infected bees altruistically remove themselves from the hive in efforts {{to stop the spread of}} disease to the bee colony.A bee leaving the hive and going towards a light source at night has yet to be observed. However, many dead bees have been observed near light sources, and when collected many of these bees show evidence of being parasitized, thus leading to the conclusion that parasitized bees might be drawn to light sources at night. The mechanisms of this phenomenon have yet to be analyzed but possible culprits are mechanical interference of the larva growing within the bee, or a response to chemical signals the larva are emitting in the bee.|$|R
5000|$|The queen {{emerges from}} her cell after 15 days of {{development}} and she remains in the hive for 3-7 days before venturing out on a mating flight. Mating flight is otherwise known as [...] "nuptial flight". Her first orientation flight may only last a few seconds, just enough to mark {{the position of the}} <b>hive.</b> Subsequent <b>mating</b> flights may last from 5 minutes to 30 minutes, and she may mate with a number of male drones on each flight. Over several matings, possibly a dozen or more, the queen receives and stores enough sperm from a succession of drones to fertilize hundreds of thousands of eggs. If she does not manage to leave the hive to mate—possibly due to bad weather or being trapped in part of the hive—she remains infertile and becomes a drone layer, incapable of producing female worker bees. Worker bees sometimes kill a non-performing queen and produce another. Without a properly performing queen, the hive is doomed.|$|R
40|$|I {{studied a}} {{potential}} function and underlying mechanism(s) {{of the magnetic}} sense in honey bees, Apis mellifera. A waggle-dancing bee informs <b>hive</b> <b>mates</b> about a food source. Directional information pointing to the food source relative to the sun 2 ̆ 7 s azimuth is encoded in the angle between the straight segment of her waggle dance and a reference line such as gravity or the local geomagnetic field (LGMF). Neither cancelling the LGMF nor shifting its declination affected the recruitment success of waggle-dancing bees, implicating gravity as the reference line for the dance alignment. To study the underlying mechanism(s) of the bees’ magnetic sense, I analyzed lyophilized and pelletized bee tagmata by a Superconducting Quantum Interference Device. A distinct hysteresis loop for the abdomen {{but not for the}} thorax or the head of bees indicated the presence of magnetite in the abdomen. Magnetic remanence of abdomen pellets produced from bees that I did, or did not, expose to an NdFeB magnet while alive differed, indicating that magnet-exposure altered the magnetization of this magnetite in live bees. Following exposure of live bees to the same magnet, magnetized bees, unlike sham-treated control bees, failed to sense the presence of a magnetic anomaly, demonstrating a functional connection between magnetite in the abdomen and the magnetoreceptor, and temporary or permanent disablement of the receptor through magnet-exposure. To test whether bees sense the polarity of a magnetic field, I trained bees to associate a magnetic anomaly with a sugar water reward. I then presented trained bees with a sugar water reward in two separate watch glasses, placing one reward {{in the center of the}} anomaly that I either kept the same as during bee training (control experiment) or that I altered by reversing its polarity (treatment experiment). That bees continued to recognize the magnetic anomaly when its polarity was kept unaltered, but failed to recognize it when its polarity was reversed, indicates that bees have a polarity-sensitive magnetoreceptor. To increase the detectability of magnetite in bee tissues, I lyophilized samples to reduce water content, maximized the signal amplitude by pelletizing samples, and accounted for sample dimensions in data analyses...|$|R
40|$|Honeybee colony {{survival}} strongly {{relies on}} the queen to overcome worker losses exposed to combined stressors like pesticides and parasites. Queen’s capacity to withstand these stressors is however very little known. The effects of the common neonicotinoid pesticide imidacloprid in a chronic and sublethal exposure together with the wide distributed parasite Nosema ceranae have therefore been investigated on queen’s physiology and survivorship in laboratory and field conditions. Early physiological changes were observed on queens, particularly the increase of enzyme activities (catalase [CAT] and glutathione-S-transferase [GST] in the heads) related to protective responses to xenobiotics and oxidative stress against pesticide and parasite alone or combined. Stressors also alter the activity of two other enzymes (carboxylesterase alpha [CaE α] and carboxylesterase para [CaE p] in the midguts) involved in metabolic and detoxification functions. Furthermore, single and combined effects of pesticide and parasite decrease survivorship of queens introduced into <b>mating</b> <b>hives</b> for three months. Because colony demographic regulation relies on queen’s fertility, the compromise of its physiology and life can seriously menace colony survival under pressure of combined stressors...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} {{the acceptance of}} 4 -day old virgin queens introduced into <b>mating</b> nucleus <b>hives</b> using natural and artificial queen cells versus a wooden 3 -hole mailing cage, a standard introduction method.

40|$|In beekeeping, queen {{honey bees}} are often {{temporarily}} kept alive in cages. We determined {{the survival of}} newly-emerged virgin honey bee queens every day for seven days in an experiment that simultaneously investigated three factors: queen cage type (wooden three-hole or plastic), attendant workers (present or absent) and food type (sugar candy, honey, or both). Ten queens were tested {{in each of the}} 12 combinations. Queens were reared using standard beekeeping methods (Doolittle/grafting) and emerged from their cells into vials held in an incubator at 34 C. All 12 combinations gave high survival (90 or 100 %) for three days but only one method (wooden cage, with attendants, honey) gave 100 % survival to day seven. Factors affecting queen survival were analysed. Across all combinations, attendant bees significantly increased survival (18 % vs. 53 %, p< 0. 001). In addition, there was an interaction between food type and cage type (p< 0. 001) with the honey and plastic cage combination giving reduced survival. An additional group of queens was reared and held for seven days using the best method, and then directly introduced using smoke into queenless nucleus colonies that had been dequeened five days previously. Acceptance was high (80 %, 8 / 10) showing that this combination is also suitable for preparing queens for introduction into colonies. Having a simple method for keeping newly-emerged virgin queens alive in cages for one week and acceptable for introduction into queenless colonies will be useful in honey bee breeding. In particular, it facilitates the screening of many queens for genetic or phenotypic characteristics when only a small proportion meets the desired criteria. These can then be introduced into queenless <b>hives</b> for natural <b>mating</b> or insemination, both of which take place when queens are one week old...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the better hygienic behaviour determination method that is used in controlling against bee diseases and pests. Total forty honeybee colonies (Apis mellifera anatoliaca) were used and they were randomly divided into two groups (each group consists of twenty colonies) in first year. Liquid nitrogen method was used in the first group' colonies and pin-killing (needling process) method was used in the second group’ colonies to determine the effectiveness of methods for hygienic behaviour. Average clearance rate was found as 66. 25 % and 78. 10 % in the first (Liquid nitrogen application) and the second (pin-killing) groups respectively. In the second year, forty colonies were divided into five equal groups and each group consisted eight colonies. The first group consisted of 9 frames bees in standard langstroot hive (10 frame capacity), the second group consisted of 5 frames bees in standard langstroot hive (10 frame capacity), the third group consisted of 5 frames bees in ruşet hive (5 frame capacity), the forth group’s consisted of 3 frames bees in ruşet hive (5 frame capacity) and the fifty group consisted of queen <b>mating</b> <b>hive.</b> The pin-killing (needling process) method, tested in first year, was used for all groups to determine the effectiveness of colony population and the size of hive.

A queenless colony continues to kill virgin queens for almost 100 hours after being dequeened. Queens return from the mating flight with the male genitalia. A queen, marked on her return from her only mating flight, lived {{for three years and}} one month. Males average 1, 156, 850 spermatozoa. A recently mated queen had, in oviducts and spermatheca, 1, 018, 333 sperm. Since she returned with the male genitalia we concluded she mated with only one drone. Another queen which had laid only 30 eggs had 950, 000 in the spermatheca indicating that about 97 % of the sperm from the drone had reached the spermatheca: an efficiency of the ejaculation much greater than in A. mellifera. A spermatheca examined immediately after the queen returned from her mating flight showed spermatozoa moving at a speed of 11. 4 to 16. 0 mm per minute. 2 -Trigona (Tetragonisca) jaty. Males gather in resting groups close to the entrance of the hive during swarming. These 3, 000 males dispersed {{a few days after the}} queen was mated. More than one virgin flies from the mother colony to the new one during swarming. After a virgin is successfully mated remaining virgin queens are imprisoned in isolated waxy cells and die there. Spermatheca were found to contain 108, 260 sperm. 3 -Trigona (Plebeia) droryana. Males of this species, attracted by the smell of the orchid, Trigonidium obtusum, tried to mate with this flower. An anaesthetized queen placed on the flower (whose scent is believed to resemble that of the virgin queen) attracted males which tried to copulate with her in the normal position of solitary bees, male above female. 4 -Trigona (Scaptotrigona) postica. During swarming as many as three virgin queens flew to the new home. A day later only one queen was found. A virgin queen born in a normal <b>hive,</b> but not <b>mated,</b> is tolerated for about 15 days, then she is persecuted by the bees and killed. Up to 8 virgin queens were found in a queen-right hive. Males leave the hive after a few days and then congregate in groups within 20 - 250 cm of the hive entrance. Greatest flight activity is between 1 : 00 and 3 : 00 P. M. Males feed directly from flowers within a flight range of about 600 meters, which is comparable to the flight range of workers. Males gathered in groups before a hive, may belong to several different colonies. 5 -Apis mellifera. Sperm counts of male ejaculations varied from 1, 600, 000 to 9, 610, 000 with an average of about 6, 000, 000. No correlation was found between body weight of drones and sperm count. Drones from one hive lacked spermatozoa. A queen which had been laying for 40 days had 5, 600, 000 sperm in her spermatheca. Two queens dissected on their return from the mating flight showed 43, 440, 000 and 69, 590, 000 sperm in their oviducts and spermatheca suggesting matings with 7 - 12 drones on a single flight. Sperm in the spermatheca were actively motile for approximately 60 minutes before becoming non-motile. Their motility was slower than sperm of M. quadrifasciata quadrifasciata.

Todos os algoritmos obtiveram bons resultados, com sutil vantagem para o MINPGAThrough {{the last}} three decades the evolutionary algorithms have been successful on application to many areas. Easily applied, efficiency and confidence are the main advantages of the evolutionary algorithms. In the groundwater remediation, generally, the objectives are the cost minimization, minimization of contaminant presence, maximization of pumping efficiency, among others. These objectives are naturally in conflicting and the search for optimal solutions, or almost optimal solutions are needed. In view of that, the evolutionary optimization methods have been applied and refined in order to search these solutions. A brief description of these methods is presented, referring to their advantages and limitations. Five mathematical functions are used to measure the algorithms performance and allow a comparison between them. In order to optimize a âpump-and-treatâ system in the remediation of a hypothetical site, multi-population evolutionary algorithms are used, considering the problem multi-objective dimension. The multi-population approach has been applied as mitigate for the main evolutionary optimization drawback: the excessive computational time. The groundwater flow modeler MODFLOW (modular finite-difference flow model) is used with the contaminant transport simulator MT 3 DMS (modular three-dimensional multispecies transport model). Two multi-population algorithms are presented: MINPGA (Multi-Island Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm), that is a NPGA (Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm) multi-population version with the injection island approach; MHBMO (Multi-Hive Honey Bee Mating Optimization), that is a HBMO (Honey Bee Mating Optimization) multi-population version.
