5|$|At {{the time}} of his sudden death in 1940, Scott {{believed}} himself a failure, and Zelda's death in 1948 was little noted. However, interest in the Fitzgeralds surged in the years following their deaths. In 1950, screenwriter Budd Schulberg, who knew the couple from his Hollywood years, wrote The Disenchanted, with characters based recognizably on the Fitzgeralds who end up as forgotten former celebrities, he awash with alcohol and she befuddled by mental illness. It was followed in 1951 by Cornell University professor Arthur Mizener's The Far Side of Paradise, a biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald that rekindled interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> among scholars. Mizener's biography was serialized in The Atlantic Monthly, and a story about the book appeared in Life magazine, then one of America's most widely read and discussed periodicals. Scott was viewed as a fascinating failure; Zelda's mental health was largely blamed for his lost potential.|$|E

Bunin and Muromtseva married officially only in 1922, after he managed at last to divorce Tsakni legally. Decades later Vera Muromtseva-Bunina became famous in her own right with her book Life of Bunin.|$|E
25|$|A {{paradigm}} {{used for}} primetime couples is the love-hate relationship plotline. In the television series Dynasty, characters Krystle and Blake (Linda Evans and John Forsythe) are seen fighting for years, through ex-lovers {{and a host}} of other interferences. Krystle winds up in a coma and Blake spends years in jail, but their love eventually wins out over their problems. This resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> subsequently becoming one of television's classic supercouples. Other early primetime power couplings include Ricky and Lucy (Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball) from I Love Lucy, Pam and Bobby (Victoria Principal and Patrick Duffy) from Dallas, and Cliff and Clair Huxtable (Bill Cosby and Phylicia Rashād) from The Cosby Show, among others.|$|E
25|$|Their {{story does}} not appear to have been widely known in the later Middle Ages, either. There is no mention of the couple in Dante; Chaucer makes a very brief {{reference}} in the Wife of Bath's Prologue (lines 677–8), but no more. One of the first people to show a deeper interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> appears to have been Petrarch, who owned an early 14th-century manuscript of the couple's letters. This silence on what is today seen as a particularly touching story is perhaps surprising, given the Renaissance ideal of courtly love – but it is possible that the story of Abelard and Héloïse could not be appropriately fitted into the ideals of the lover's devotion to the chaste and unattainable lady.|$|E

25|$|Even before Ukraine became {{independent}} in August 1991, {{political parties in}} Ukraine started to form around intellectuals and former Soviet dissidents. They posed the main opposition to the ruling Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine (CP(b)U). At the first convocation of the Verkhovna Rada those parties formed the parliamentary opposition People's Council. The most noticeable parties of the parliamentary opposition included the People's Movement of Ukraine (The Movement) and the Ukrainian Republican Party. Due to the August Putsch in Moscow (19–21 August 1991), a process to prohibit communist parties in Ukraine took place. Led by Oleksandr Moroz, the parliamentary faction of the CP(b)U, Group of 239, started a process to re-form the CP(b)U into the Socialist Party of Ukraine. The restriction {{on the existence of}} communist parties in Ukraine was successfully adopted soon after the Ukrainian independence, however <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> of years the resolution was later challenged and eventually the restriction was lifted. In 1993 in Donetsk the first congress of the reinstated Communist Party of Ukraine took place, with the Party led by Petro Symonenko.|$|E
500|$|Crowley {{was born}} as Edward Alexander Crowley at 30 Clarendon Square in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, on 12 October 1875. His father, Edward Crowley (1834–87), was trained as an engineer, but his share in a lucrative family brewing business, Crowley's Alton Ales, had {{allowed him to}} retire before his son was born. His mother, Emily Bertha Bishop (1848–1917), came from a Devonshire-Somerset family and had a {{strained}} relationship with her son; she described him as [...] "the Beast", a name that he revelled <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> <b>couple</b> had been married at London's Kensington Registry Office in November 1874, and were evangelical Christians. Crowley's father had been born a Quaker, but had converted to the Exclusive Brethren, a faction of a Christian fundamentalist group known as the Plymouth Brethren, with Emily joining him upon marriage. Crowley's father was particularly devout, spending his time as a travelling preacher for the sect and reading a chapter from the Bible {{to his wife and}} son after breakfast every day. Following the death of their baby daughter in 1880, in 1881 the Crowleys moved to Redhill, Surrey. At the age of 8, Crowley was sent to H.T. Habershon's evangelical Christian boarding school in Hastings, and then to Ebor preparatory school in Cambridge, run by the Reverend Henry d'Arcy Champney, whom Crowley considered a sadist.|$|E
500|$|Lowell was an abolitionist, but his {{opinions}} wavered concerning African-Americans. He advocated suffrage for blacks, yet {{he noted that}} their ability to vote could be troublesome. Even so, he wrote, [...] "We believe the white race, by their intellectual and traditional superiority, will retain sufficient ascendancy to prevent any serious mischief from the new order of things." [...] Freed slaves, he wrote, were [...] "dirty, lazy & lying". Even before his marriage to abolitionist Maria White, Lowell wrote: [...] "The abolitionists {{are the only ones}} with whom I sympathize of the present extant parties." [...] After his marriage, Lowell at first did not share his wife's enthusiasm for the cause, but he was eventually pulled <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> <b>couple</b> often gave money to fugitive slaves, even when their own financial situation was not strong, especially if they were asked to free a spouse or child. Even so, he did not always fully agree with the followers of the movement. The majority of these people, he said, [...] "treat ideas as ignorant persons do cherries. They think them unwholesome unless they are swallowed, stones and all." [...] Lowell depicted Southerners very unfavorably in his second collection of The Biglow Papers but, by 1865, admitted that Southerners were [...] "guilty only of weakness" [...] and, by 1868, said that he sympathized with Southerners and their viewpoint on slavery. Enemies and friends of Lowell alike questioned his vacillating interest in the question of slavery. Abolitionist Samuel Joseph May accused him of trying to quit the movement because of his association with Harvard and the Boston Brahmin culture: [...] "Having got into the smooth, dignified, self-complacent, and change-hating society of the college and its Boston circles, Lowell has gone over to the world, and to 'respectability'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{example of}} gorillas' {{significant}} intelligence is {{their ability to}} comprehend simple sign language. In the mid-1970s, researchers {{turned their attention to}} communicating with gorillas via sign language. One gorilla, Koko, was born in San Francisco Zoo on July 4, 1971. A woman named Francine Patterson officially started working with Koko on July 12, 1972, with the goal of teaching her sign language. In the beginning, Dr. Petterson focused on teaching Koko only three basic signs: [...] "food," [...] "drink," [...] and [...] "more." [...] Koko would learn signs through observation, Dr. Patterson, or one of her colleagues by molding Koko's hands into the correct sign. On August 7, Patterson began a more formal routine of teaching Koko the signs, [...] "food," [...] "drink," [...] and [...] "more." [...] <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>couple</b> weeks before that, Koko had been using gestures that seemed like attempts at the signs taught, but were deemed as coincidental and random and not intended for the actual purpose. Only two days after they started the more formal routine, Koko started responding consistently with the sign [...] "food" [...] when prompted to. Within the first three months, Koko made 16 different combinations of signs and was also starting to form simple questions by using eye contact and different positioning of signs by the body. Koko mastered more than 1,000 signs and was said to be able to connect up to 8 words together to form a statement expressing wants, needs, thoughts, or simple responses. Today, Koko resides at The Gorilla Foundation in Woodside, California.|$|E
