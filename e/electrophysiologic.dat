25|$|Electrodiagnostic testing (also called <b>electrophysiologic)</b> {{includes}} nerve conduction {{studies which}} involves stimulating a peripheral motor or sensory nerve and recording the response, and needle electromyography, where a thin needle or pin-like electrode is {{inserted into the}} muscle tissue to look for abnormal electrical activity.|$|E
25|$|An evoked {{potential}} or evoked response is an electrical potential recorded from {{the nervous system}} of a human or other animal following presentation of a stimulus, as distinct from spontaneous potentials as detected by electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), or other <b>electrophysiologic</b> recording method. Such potentials are useful for electrodiagnosis and monitoring.|$|E
25|$|Electrocardiography (ECG or EKG) is {{the process}} of {{recording}} the electrical activity of the heart {{over a period of time}} using electrodes placed on the skin. These electrodes detect the tiny electrical changes on the skin that arise from the heart muscle's <b>electrophysiologic</b> pattern of depolarizing and repolarizing during each heartbeat. It is a very commonly performed cardiology test.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the work}} in the late nineties and 2000s has been looking to {{refining}} testing, developing more sophisticated treatment options, and looking for genetic risk factors for APD. Scientists have worked on improving behavioral tests of auditory function, neuroimaging, electroacoustic, and <b>electrophysiologic</b> testing. Working with new technology has led to a number of software programs for auditory training. With global awareness of mental disorders and increasing understanding of neuroscience, auditory processing is more in the public and academic consciousness than ever before.|$|E
25|$|Ménière's {{disease is}} a {{vestibular}} disorder of unknown origin, but {{is thought to be}} caused by an increase in the amount of endolymphatic fluid present in the inner ear (endolymphatic hydrops). However, this idea has not been directly confirmed with histopathologic studies but <b>electrophysiologic</b> studies have been suggestive of this mechanism. Ménière's disease frequently presents with recurrent, spontaneous attacks of severe vertigo in combination with ringing in the ears (tinnitus), a feeling of pressure or fullness in the ear (aural fullness), severe nausea or vomiting, imbalance, and hearing loss. As the disease worsens, hearing loss will progress.|$|E
25|$|Multimodal imaging {{frequently}} {{consists of}} the coupling of an <b>electrophysiologic</b> measurement technique, such as EEG or MEG, with a hemodynamic one such as fMRI or PET. While the intention {{is to use the}} strengths and limitations of each to complement the other, current approaches suffer from experimental limitations. Some previous work has focused on attempting to use the high spatial resolution of fMRI to determine the (spatial) origin of EEG/MEG signals, so that in future work this spatial information could be extracted from a unimodal EEG/MEG signal. While some studies have seen success in correlating signal origins between modalities to within a few millimeters, the results have not been uniformly positive. Another current limitation is the actual experimental setup: taking measurements using both modalities at once yields inferior signals, but the alternative of measuring each modality separately is confounded by trial-to-trial variability.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th century, Andreas Vesalius and Francesco Piccolomini {{were the}} first to {{distinguish}} between white matter, the cortex, and the subcortical nuclei in the brain. About a century later, Thomas Willis noticed that the corpus striatum was typically discolored, shrinkened, and abnormally softened in the cadavers of people who had died from paralysis. The view that the corpus striatum played such a large role in motor functions was the most prominent one until the 19th century when <b>electrophysiologic</b> stimulation studies began to be performed. For example, Gustav Fritsch and Eduard Hitzig performed them on dog cerebral cortices in 1870, while David Ferrier performed them, along with ablation studies, on cerebral cortices of dogs, rabbits, cats, and primates in 1876. During the same year, John Hughlings Jackson posited that the motor cortex was more relevant to motor function than the corpus striatum after carrying out clinical-pathologic experiments in humans. Soon it would be discovered that the theory about the corpus striatum would not be completely incorrect.|$|E
25|$|Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) is a Bayesian {{method for}} deducing the {{structure}} of a neural system based on the observed hemodynamic (fMRI) or <b>electrophysiologic</b> (EEG/MEG) signal. The first step is to make a prediction as to the relationships between the brain regions of interest, and formulate a system of ordinary differential equations describing the causal relationship between them, although many parameters (and relationships) will be initially unknown. Using previous results on how neural activity is known to translate into fMRI or EEG signals, one can take the measured signal and determine the likelihood that model parameters have particular values. The elucidated model can then be used to predict relationships between the considered brain regions under different conditions. A key factor to consider during the design of neuroimaging experiments involving DCM is the relationship between the timing of tasks or stimuli presented to the subject and the ability of DCM to determine the underlying relationships between brain regions, which is partially determined by the temporal resolution of the imaging modality in use.|$|E

In AVNRT, the fast and slow pathways are located within the right atrium close to or within the AV node and exhibit <b>electrophysiologic</b> properties similar to AV nodal tissue.
