5|$|Analysis is the {{activity}} of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts {{in order to understand}} it. Reductionism can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be <b>described</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of human physiology, which in turn might be <b>described</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of chemistry and physics. Daniel Dennett distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls greedy reductionism, which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Alfred J. Lotka {{proposed}} that natural selection might {{be understood as}} a physical principle that could be <b>described</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of the use of energy by a system, a concept later developed by Howard T. Odum as the maximum power principle in thermodynamics, whereby evolutionary systems with selective advantage maximise the rate of useful energy transformation.|$|E
5|$|In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one {{considers}} string theory or M-theory on an anti-de Sitter background. This {{means that the}} geometry of spacetime is <b>described</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of a certain vacuum solution of Einstein's equation called anti-de Sitter space.|$|E

5|$|Schizophrenia {{is often}} <b>described</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of {{positive}} and negative (or deficit) symptoms. Positive symptoms are those that most individuals do not normally experience, but are present in people with schizophrenia. They can include delusions, disordered thoughts and speech, and tactile, auditory, visual, olfactory and gustatory hallucinations, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis. Hallucinations are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme. Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication.|$|E
5|$|Atoms lack a {{well-defined}} outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually <b>described</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of an atomic radius. This {{is a measure}} of the distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus. However, this assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space. Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a chemical bond. The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms (coordination number) and a quantum mechanical property known as spin. On the periodic table of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right). Consequently, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32pm, while one of the largest is caesium at 225pm.|$|E
5|$|Examples {{of common}} human {{diseases}} caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, chickenpox, and cold sores. Many serious {{diseases such as}} Ebola virus disease, AIDS, avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is <b>described</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of virulence. Other diseases are under investigation to discover {{if they have a}} virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome. There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause neurological diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans.|$|E
50|$|Segmental {{analysis}} {{is a method}} of anatomical analysis for describing the connective morphology of the human body.

5|$|In the AdS/CFT correspondence, the {{geometry}} of spacetime is <b>described</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of a certain vacuum solution of Einstein's equation called anti-de Sitter space. In very elementary terms, anti-de Sitter space is a mathematical model of spacetime in which the notion of distance between points (the metric) {{is different from the}} notion of distance in ordinary Euclidean geometry. It is closely related to hyperbolic space, which {{can be viewed as a}} disk as illustrated on the left. This image shows a tessellation of a disk by triangles and squares. One can define the distance between points of this disk in such a way that all the triangles and squares are the same size and the circular outer boundary is infinitely far from any point in the interior.|$|E
5|$|The {{behavior}} of certain other systems, such as one-dimensional cyclic cellular automata, {{can also be}} <b>described</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of ballistic annihilation. There is a technical restriction on the particle positions for the ballistic annihilation view of Rule 184 that does not arise in these other systems, stemming from the alternating pattern of the background: in the particle system corresponding to a Rule 184 state, if two consecutive particles are both of the same type they must be an odd number of cells apart, while if they are of opposite types they must be an even number of cells apart. However this parity restriction does not {{play a role in}} the statistical {{behavior of}} this system.|$|E
5|$|The {{significance}} {{of the concept of}} a Hilbert space was underlined with the realization that it offers one of the best mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics. In short, the states of a quantum mechanical system are vectors in a certain Hilbert space, the observables are hermitian operators on that space, the symmetries of the system are unitary operators, and measurements are orthogonal projections. The relation between quantum mechanical symmetries and unitary operators provided an impetus {{for the development of the}} unitary representation theory of groups, initiated in the 1928 work of Hermann Weyl. On the other hand, in the early 1930s it became clear that classical mechanics can be <b>described</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of Hilbert space (Koopman–von Neumann classical mechanics) and that certain properties of classical dynamical systems can be analyzed using Hilbert space techniques in the framework of ergodic theory.|$|E

5|$|Covenant {{theology}} is an interpretive framework used by Reformed theologians which was significantly {{developed during the}} seventeenth century. Under this scheme, as articulated by the Assembly, God's dealings with men are <b>described</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of two covenants: the covenant of works and covenant of grace. The Westminster Confession {{was the first major}} Reformed symbol to explicitly mention the covenant of works (sometimes called the covenant of life), in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience. In the fall of man, Adam broke the covenant of works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. To remedy this, God offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the covenant of grace. This covenant allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God's law perfectly. The idea of the covenant of grace was a much more common feature of orthodox Reformed theology. The Westminster divines set these two covenants against each other as the two major ways in which God deals with people.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 732, Marwan led 40,000 men north into Khazar lands. The {{accounts}} of this campaign are confused: Ibn A'tham records that he reached Balanjar and returned to Derbent with much captured livestock, but the campaign is <b>described</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> strongly reminiscent of Maslama's expeditions in 728 and 731, and its veracity is open to doubt. Ibn Khayyat {{on the other hand}} reports that Marwan led a far more limited campaign on the country immediately to the north of Derbent and then retired there to spend the winter. Marwan was more active in the south, where he raised Ashot III Bagratuni to the position of presiding prince of Armenia, effectively granting the country broad autonomy in exchange for the service of its soldiers alongside the Caliphate's armies. This unique concession points, according to Blankinship, to the worsening manpower crisis faced by the Caliphate. At about the same time, the Khazars and Byzantines strengthened their ties and formalized their alliance against their common enemy with the marriage of Constantine V to the Khazar princess Tzitzak.|$|E
5|$|So far {{some success}} has been {{achieved}} in using string theory methods to describe the transition of a superfluid to an insulator. A superfluid is a system of electrically neutral atoms that flows without any friction. Such systems are often produced in the laboratory using liquid helium, but recently experimentalists have developed new ways of producing artificial superfluids by pouring trillions of cold atoms into a lattice of criss-crossing lasers. These atoms initially behave as a superfluid, but as experimentalists increase {{the intensity of the}} lasers, they become less mobile and then suddenly transition to an insulating state. During the transition, the atoms behave in an unusual way. For example, the atoms slow to a halt at a rate that depends on the temperature and on Planck's constant, the fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics, which does not enter into the description of the other phases. This behavior has recently been understood by considering a dual description where properties of the fluid are <b>described</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of a higher dimensional black hole.|$|E
