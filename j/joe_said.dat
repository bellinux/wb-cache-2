500|$|After {{the release}} of the album, the {{youngest}} of the brothers, Joe Loeffler, was dismissed from Chevelle. Due to different stories from the band members, it is unclear whether he was fired or left the band of his own accord. Pete and Sam stated the following on the band's official website: [...] "After three years of non-stop touring and recording, Joe is taking a break to be home with family. We'll miss having him on the road with us, but as his brothers and bandmates we respect his decision and are looking forward to getting out there and playing for the fans. See you on tour." [...] However, according to Ultimate Guitar Archive, <b>Joe</b> <b>said</b> he was fired.|$|E

500|$|Harry and the Potters {{with its}} strong persona or theme {{is as much}} a {{performance}} art project as it is a rock band. Musically, they sound much like other indie rock music with the exception that the band adheres to a novel conceit: the Harry Potter books will inspire the lyrics. As <b>Joe</b> <b>said</b> in a 2005 interview, [...] "We try to take the themes from the books and amplify them." [...] Their musical sound is described as [...] "simple, catchy rock – think The White Stripes crossed with Raffi – where everyone sings along which is easy because in songs like 'Voldemort Can't Stop the Rock' the title is pretty much the only line." [...] Another reviewer’s ear hears [...] "a touch of the Ramones in their ultra simple lyrics." ...|$|E
500|$|In two {{separate}} 2016 AMAs on Reddit, both Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas {{reflected on the}} episode. [...] "When it first came out I didn't think it was funny to be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time, so it just made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on," [...] Nick said. [...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came out I was so pumped". <b>Joe</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I {{thought it was the}} funniest thing at the time and it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened. Now I watch it back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{recruiting}} drummer Ernie Kim, {{the band}} recorded their eponymous debut album over {{a weekend in}} the DeGeorge family living room. Released in June 2003 under the Eskimo Laboratories record label, the album contains six of the seven songs composed on June 22, 2002 and another twelve written spontaneously and immediately thereafter recorded. [...] In [...] "the summer of" [...] 2003, Harry and the Potters set out on an American tour, performing at libraries. The fifth Harry Potter book [...] Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix [...] came out that summer and on June 21, 2003, the highly anticipated day of release, the band played five sets in a span of 24 hours. The library gigs drew crowds of mostly children and their parents. The brothers played a show at the library in Dorchester, Massachusetts that August where they noticed {{the children in the}} audience singing along. <b>Joe</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Paul forgot the words to one of the songs. [...] were like, 'You sang it wrong!'" [...] Paul said, [...] "They'd be like, 'Hey, why'd you skip that song?' because they knew the exact sequence of the album." [...] The DeGeorge brothers quickly developed an on-stage persona of dressing in the fashion of wizard-school Hogwarts: white shirts under gray crew-neck sweaters, red-and-yellow striped ties, wire-rim glasses. In a show of quirky egalitarianism, both brothers play the role of Harry Potter and dress almost identically; Paul is older and to conform to the character’s persona, he is Harry of Year 7; while Joe is the Harry of Year 4.|$|E
