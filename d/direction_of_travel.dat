5|$|Agrium Vanscoy Potash Operations is Canada's {{third largest}} {{producer}} of potash fertilizer. In the 1930s early homesteaders would maintain Highway 7 {{as a means}} to supplement their income. Provincial Highway 7 followed the Canadian Northern railway grade for <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> with the actual road way being on the square on the Dominion survey township lines. Highway 7 was widened in 1944 and rebuilt between 1960 and 1961.|$|E
5|$|Originally, a toll {{was paid}} for each <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> with sets of toll booths on both carriageways. In 1997, the {{northbound}} toll was doubled (from 40p to 80p) and the southbound toll abolished on the presumption that almost all traffic makes a return journey across the bridge, and that {{the removal of the}} southbound toll would result in a reduction of congestion without reducing revenue.|$|E
5|$|The {{captain of}} a sailing ship seeks a course along which the winds can be {{expected}} to blow in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel.</b> During the Age of Sail, the pattern of prevailing winds made various points of the globe easy or difficult to access, and therefore had a direct effect on European empire-building and thus on modern political geography. For example, Manila galleons could not sail into the wind at all.|$|E

5|$|A highsider, highside, or {{high side}} {{is a type of}} bike motion which is caused by a rear wheel gaining {{traction}} when it is not facing in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel,</b> usually after slipping sideways in a curve. This can occur under heavy braking, acceleration, a varying road surface, or suspension activation, especially due to interaction with the drive train. It can {{take the form of a}} single slip-then-flip or a series of violent oscillations.|$|E
5|$|Caroline Island is {{believed}} to have originated from a volcanic hotspot which eroded and then became home to a coral reef which grew above the ocean surface. Although these geological processes are poorly understood, the orientation of the Line Islands (roughly north-south) suggests that they were formed more than 40 million years ago, before the Pacific Plate changed its <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel.</b> The same hotspot more recently gave rise to the Tuamotu Archipelago.|$|E
5|$|ECTunes is {{developing}} a system that utilizes directional sound equipment to emit noise when {{and where it is}} needed. According to the company, its technology sends audible signals only in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel,</b> thus allowing the vehicle to be heard by those who may be in the car's path, without disturbing others with unwelcome noise. Insero Horsens, a Danish venture company, has provided a significant investment to help ECTunes fully develop its technology.|$|E

40|$|A belt for {{transmitting}} power from a cogged driving member to a cogged driven member {{such as a}} pair of wheel sprockets is described. The belt has inflexible teeth spaced along the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> its <b>travel.</b> Each <b>of</b> the teeth has a longitudinal axis transverse to the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> belt <b>travel.</b> The belt also includes substantially inextensible fasts spaced transversely to the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> belt <b>travel.</b> The fasts extend in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> belt <b>travel</b> adjacent to the teeth and are looped around preselected numbers of the teeth...|$|R

5|$|Turning {{forces are}} {{generated}} during maneuvers for balancing {{in addition to}} just changing <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel.</b> These may be interpreted as centrifugal forces in the accelerating reference frame of the bike and rider; or simply as inertia in a stationary, inertial reference frame and not forces at all. Gyroscopic forces acting on rotating parts such as wheels, engine, transmission, etc., are also due to the inertia of those rotating parts. They are discussed further in the section on gyroscopic effects below.|$|E
5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} leading edge of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as {{the leading edge of the}} isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to twice as fast as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel,</b> {{at the leading edge}} of the cooler air mass.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{scientists}} {{described the}} first known extensive dromaeosaurid trackway, in Shandong, China. In addition to confirming {{the hypothesis that the}} sickle-claw was held retracted off the ground, the trackway (made by a large, Achillobator-sized species) showed evidence of six individuals of about equal size moving together along a shoreline. The individuals were spaced about one meter apart, and retained the same <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel,</b> walking at a fairly slow pace. The authors of the paper describing these footprints interpreted the trackways as evidence that some species of dromaeosaurids lived in groups. While the trackways clearly do not represent hunting behavior, the idea that groups of dromaeosaurids may have hunted together, according to the authors, could not be ruled out.|$|E

50|$|Most Soviet trams (of {{which some}} {{are still in}} use in ex-USSR) had no means to swing the bows over. These trams were not {{designed}} to travel two ways. Another example is KTV-55-2 tramcar which had two bow collectors for the two <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>travelling.</b>|$|R
5|$|On 26 February, {{an interim}} report {{published}} by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch outlined the current progress of the investigation. The report contained a single conclusion, that the immediate cause of the accident was {{the condition of the}} stretcher bar arrangement at points 2B at Lambrigg crossover, which resulted in the loss of gauge separation of the point switch blades. The stretcher bars (components that hold the moving blades of the points the correct distance apart) had been found to be disconnected or missing. Of the three bars, one was not in position, another had nuts and bolts missing, and two were fractured. The points in question were facing the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> of the train.|$|E
5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. In a warm occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel.</b> Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E
5|$|Most {{octopuses}} swim by expelling a jet {{of water}} from the mantle through the siphon into the sea. The physical principle behind this is that the force required to accelerate the water through the orifice produces a reaction that propels the octopus in the opposite direction. The <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> depends on the orientation of the siphon. When swimming, the head is at the front and the siphon is pointed backwards, but when jetting, the visceral hump leads, the siphon points towards the head and the arms trail behind, with the animal presenting a fusiform appearance. In an alternative method of swimming, some species flatten themselves dorso-ventrally, and swim with the arms held out sideways, and this may provide lift and be faster than normal swimming. Jetting is used to escape from danger, but is physiologically inefficient, requiring a mantle pressure so high as to stop the heart from beating, resulting in a progressive oxygen deficit.|$|E
50|$|Businesses such as {{restaurants}} and retail establishments often have locator maps online to help potential customers find their location. These are sometimes accompanied by driving and parking directions {{from one or}} more <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel,</b> especially if many of their customers are not from the local area.|$|R
50|$|White is {{also used}} on divided expressways with a solid raised center divider. Two-lane expressways where poles are the only {{physical}} barrier between opposing <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> always have yellow {{either side of the}} row of poles, and white is between the yellow striping and the poles.|$|R
50|$|The freeways' acute {{intersecting}} angles {{make the}} interchange not permit motorists entering the interchange to exit in all possible <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel.</b> For example, motorists approaching the interchange on northbound US 101 may continue westbound ("northbound") on US 101 or northbound on SR 170 {{but not to}} eastbound SR 134.|$|R
5|$|The game spans six levels, each lasting {{about five}} minutes, {{with a variety}} of boss battles. Over the course of the game, the plot is {{revealed}} through cutscenes using the game's own graphic engine. Gameplay consists of a player controlling a flying dragon and his rider through an aiming reticle that can be moved over the whole screen with the D-pad; the player must shoot a variety of enemies (ranging from machines to monsters) in a 3D post-apocalyptic fantasy environment of barren landscapes and mysterious ruins of a fallen civilization. Progression through the levels is made at a predetermined pace, as the player is constantly set along a rail of gameplay. The only time the game pauses is during boss battles. The field of vision can be directed with the aiming reticle on the x and y-axis, but the overall <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> is predetermined. The dragon follows the reticle movements, allowing the player to avoid enemy projectiles and obstacles.|$|E

25|$|When {{a street}} is {{wide enough to}} {{accommodate}} several vehicles traveling side-by-side, it is usual for traffic to organize itself into lanes, that is, parallel corridors of traffic. Some roads have one lane for each <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> and others have multiple lanes for each direction. Most countries apply pavement markings to clearly indicate the limits of each lane and the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> {{that it must be}} used for. In other countries lanes have no markings at all and drivers follow them mostly by intuition rather than visual stimulus.|$|E
