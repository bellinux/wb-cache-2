The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) sought to build the stadium <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could be converted to a new baseball stadium, and ACOG paid for the conversion.

25|$|Some plays were {{documented}} either orally {{or through}} scripture yet these organizations depicted each topic <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could educate its audience. The earliest documentation of production {{within the community}} started with the play called Isuda Ti Muna/They Who Were First in 1973. It mainly encircles the lives of Filipino agricultural workers in central California. The following year Mindanao (1974) came out in which talks about the land rights if Filipino Muslims and farmers in Mindanao. In 1976 a play called Tagatupad {{came out with a}} focus on the struggles of antieviction laws within the working class Filipino community. One of the most controversial plays within this time called The Frame Up of Narciso and Perez (1979) basically focuses on the murder of Narciso and Perez’ patients at a Veterans Administration Hospital. Within the same year, Visions of a War bride (1979) focused on a Filipina that {{came to the united states}} as a war bride. Years later Ti Mangyuna (1981) led by a collaboration between the KDP and ILWU Local 142 of Hawaii headlined throughout the community. With its goal to educate the audience about labor-union drive’s. In 1990 Dogeaters by Jessica Hagedorn was published which works well as a playwright. Dogeaters talks about political and cultural issues within that time.|$|E
25|$|As noted, a {{few months}} after his {{appointment}} as ABA President Ehnat was fired by the ABA under bad circumstances and was replaced by the new ABA management by Clayton John, a former motorcycle racer and BMX track operator and who is still the current (2006) ABA President. Ehnat became Vice President of the USBA and became active in the campaign to shore up the image of the USBA which was beginning to take damaging hits in the BMX industry, including its dealings with disgraced BMX promoter Renny Roker. Bob Hadley*, team manager of the Huffy BMX team noticed at one time that Erhart was pretty prescient in questions he had with him even before he mentioned them. At the time only Clayton John was privy to the specific concerns in a letter Mr. Hadley had that he had shared only with Mr. John at the time. The timing of Ehnat responses {{and the fact that the}} USBA seemed to always be one step ahead of the ABA in court actions was so uncanny Mr. Hadley joked that someone must have bugged Mr. John's office. Clayton John took the whimsical joke seriously and had ABA headquarters swept for bugs by experts in counter surveillance and corporate espionage. After the sweep, two experts, one a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent and the other a former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent found evidence of tampering in one of the telephone trunk lines leading to Mr. John's office. The lines were stripped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was evidence that a telephone tap was in place at some time. No conclusive proof only circumstantial evidence has suggested that the USBA was responsible. Another suspect, the IRS could have done it given the pressure they put the ABA under, including showing up during ABA nationals but aside from it being illegal without a court order, the IRS had perfectly legal ways available to them to get once sensitive information about the ABA, including financial assets. Most of it was public record particularly court proceedings. The IRS had no real motive to go through the unnecessary risk of wire-tapping the ABA offices.|$|E

500|$|Sandra Lindow {{stated that}} the kemmerhouse was an [...] "effective {{cultural}} {{solution to the problem}} of sexuality", because socially acceptable promiscuous sex (both homo- and hetero-sexual) occurred in the absence of a power differential, thus making it healthy. In addition, Gethenians were shown as having an inbuilt mechanism which forces them to seek consent for any sexual activity. The story further challenges conventional sex mores because the narrator Sov is seduced by her male parent Karrid, so that she may kemmer for the first time as a woman, according to the tradition within their family. However, Karrid does not take advantage of his position, and permits no further sexual activity to take place. Lindow states that this experimentation was possible in a story written in 1995 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not when Left Hand was written; [...] "In 1968 and 1969, Le Guin's imagination did not yet include Gethenian homosexuality, gynocentrism, or the multiplicity of connection possible inside a kemmerhouse; however, by 1995 [...] much had changed in the cultural acceptance of sexuality." ...|$|E

[...] Alex Neuse, creator of the Bit.Trip series, reminisced his memories of playing Blaster Master as a child.

Paste magazine ranked Blaster Master as the 2nd greatest NES game of all time, behind The Legend of Zelda; they cited the tank's additional abilities as a main reason behind its ranking.|$|E

500|$|Mani Ratnam {{developed}} a script—originally written in English—into a film and named it Pallavi Anu Pallavi. His uncle Krishnamurthy agreed {{to produce the}} film but imposed a condition {{that it should be}} made under a limited budget in Kannada, to which he agreed. As a debutant, Mani Rahman {{wanted to make sure that}} the technical aspects of the film are good. He persuaded Balu Mahendra to do the cinematography as he found the latter's work to be very impressive. He managed to get other crew members B. Lenin (for editing), Thotta Tharani (for art direction) and Ilaiyaraaja (for music composer music), all leading craftsmen in their respective fields then. For the male lead, he cast Anil Kapoor after watching his performance in the Telugu film Vamsa Vruksham (1980). Lakshmi who was a leading actress then, was signed up as the female lead. The film explored the relationship between a young man and an older woman. Although an average grosser at the box-office, the film fetched Mani Ratnam the Best Screenplay Award from the Karnataka State Government for the year 1983. After watching Pallavi Anu Pallavi, N. G. John, a Malayalam film producer, offered him a chance to direct a film in Malayalam. Scripted by T. Damodaran, Unaru was about the corruption in labour unions of Kerala. The film was completed with in two months and got released in April 1984. Mani Ratnam attributed the failure of the film to the conflict of interests that he and the producer had. Following this, he entered Tamil cinema when G. Thyagarajan of Sathya Jyothi Films offered him a chance to direct Pagal Nilavu (1985). The film had Murali and Revathi playing lead roles. It was different from his previous two films <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> included dance sequences and a [...] "comedy track". However, the film turned out to be another failure for him. The same year, he directed another Tamil film Idaya Kovil, a romantic drama. He remodeled a ready made script on the lines of Charlie Chaplin's Limelight (1952). Described by himself as an unsatisfied work, the film was a major box-office success. The phase between 1983 and 1986 was the toughest of his career with only Pallavi Anupallavi being a satisfiable film; the rest three were done with a lot of [...] "compromises".|$|E
