5|$|The euro {{was founded}} on 1 January 1999, when it became the {{currency}} of over 300 million people in Europe. For {{the first three years}} of its existence it was an invisible currency, only used in accountancy. Euro cash was not introduced until 1 January 2002, when it replaced the national banknotes and coins of the countries in eurozone 12, such as the <b>Finnish</b> <b>markka.</b>|$|E

25|$|The lowest bid for {{building}} {{the two new}} vessels came from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. In order to save job opportunities in Finland, the Finnish state subsidised {{the construction of the}} new ships with 17 million <b>Finnish</b> <b>markka.</b> Thus, the order for the ships eventually went to Wärtsilä and both ships were to be built at their shipyard in Turku, Finland.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 1940s, Kesko's sales {{amounted}} to about 15 billion old <b>Finnish</b> <b>markkas</b> (equivalent to EUR 580 million in 2010), which was about 12% of the overall sales of the central companies operating in the Finnish trading sector.|$|R

25|$|The {{history of}} the Finnpusku {{integrated}} tug barge system dates back to 1964 when Rautaruukki started steel production in the new steel mill in Raahe, Finland, and began supplying the factory with ore concentrate, coal, coke and other raw materials. Around {{the same time the}} Finnish shipping company Finnlines researched transporting cargo by barges and developed the first version of the Finnpusku system, but due to problems in funding and the devaluation of the <b>Finnish</b> <b>markka</b> in 1967 the idea was not pursued further. However, an upgraded concept was developed in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Such was his {{impact on}} the Finnish {{political}} scene that Kekkonen's face appeared on the 500 Markka banknote during his term as President. The series of <b>Finnish</b> <b>Markka</b> banknotes used at this time was the second-to-last design series in {{the entire history of}} the currency. Very few Finns have ever got their face on a Markka note during their lifetime, and Kekkonen was the last to do so. This banknote was declared Finland's most beautiful note according to voting organised by the commemorative coins and medal marketer Suomen Moneta on 1 April 2011.|$|E
25|$|In January 1987 Johnson Line {{purchased}} the Silvia Regina from Suomen Yritysrahoitus {{with the cost}} of 189,862,839 <b>Finnish</b> <b>markka,</b> and moved her under Swedish flag. However the following year Johnson Line sold the ship to Stena Line who chartered her back to Johnson Line until Silja Line's new Helsinki–Stockholm ships (then still in planning stages) were completed. In the end the new ships were severely delayed, and {{it was not until the}} end of May 1991 that the ship stopped sailing for Silja Line. For the last months of her service with Silja she received Silja Line's new funnel colours, with the blue seal that had up until that point been painted to the side of the ship next to the name moved to the funnel.|$|E

25|$|When the Cabinet of Finland allotted {{two million}} <b>Finnish</b> <b>markkas</b> for the {{restoration}} of the old icebreaker, Tarmo was towed to Kotka in November 1990. After her interiors had been extensively documented and photographed, all fittings and furnishing were removed and stored ashore. When Tarmo was drydocked for inspection, her bottom plating was found out to be in surprisingly good condition. The deteriorated weather decks and aftship cabins were completely rebuilt.|$|R
25|$|In 1925 Ryti {{was also}} {{nominated}} {{as a presidential}} candidate at the age of 36. In the second round of voting, he received the most support. However, in the third round the Swedish People's Party, which held the balance, moved their votes to Lauri Kristian Relander, and Ryti lost to Relander by 109 votes to 172. Ryti's support increased over the years but was never enough in elections. During the 1930s he withdrew from daily politics, but influenced economic policies. Ryti was an orthodox supporter of classical liberal economics. He made his goal to tie the value of <b>Finnish</b> <b>markka</b> to the gold standard. Unlike many other European countries, Finland did not choose deflationary solutions under his leadership; and in 1926 the country shifted to the gold markka. However, after the Great Depression in 1929, Finland was forced to abandon the gold standard following the example of Great Britain.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, SF Line {{asked for}} tenders from various shipyards {{around the world}} for {{construction}} of a 1,700-passenger, 540-car ferry. The cheapest bid, 80 million <b>Finnish</b> <b>markka</b> (20 million United States dollar by exchange rates of the time), was made by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan who outbid the Finnish Wärtsilä shipyard by 36 million markka. On 13 September 1977, SF Line signed a contract with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for construction of a ferry. However, the funding of the project was subject to approval by the Bank of Finland and as at the time the employment level in Finland's shipyards was low, the Bank of Finland decided not to grant its approval to the project's funding with hopes of forcing the company to order a ship from a Finnish shipyard. After prolonged negotiations between both SF Line and the Bank of Finland as well as SF Line and Wärtsilä, SF Line placed an order with Wärtsilä on 17 March 1978. In the end the cost of the ship from Wärtsilä was approximately 15% more expensive {{than it would have been}} if built by Mitsubishi, despite a subvention of 17 million markka from the Bank of Finland.|$|E

Its members include Vainio's friends Keijo Laitinen, Pertti Metsärinne and Reijo Tani. The club has published two books entitled Junnun laululipas 1 and Junnun laululipas 2.|$|R
5|$|The Finns bought 15 new Panzer IV Ausf J in 1944, for 5,000,000 <b>Finnish</b> <b>markkas</b> each (about {{twice the}} {{production}} price). The remainder of {{an order for}} 40 tanks and some StuG were not delivered and neither were German instructors provided. The tanks arrived too late to see action against the Soviets, but were instead used against the Germans during their withdrawal through Lapland. After the war, they served as training tanks, and one portrayed a Soviet KV-1 tank in the movie The Unknown Soldier in 1955.|$|R
25|$|By 1 November 1906 tenders for the {{construction}} of a new icebreaker, similar to but slightly larger than Sampo, had been received from four European shipyards. The most expensive tender, 1,608,900 <b>Finnish</b> <b>markkas</b> (FIM), was given by Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft from Germany. It was followed by Sir W G Armstrong Whitworth & Co Ltd from England (FIM 1,575,000), Gourlay Brothers Ship Builders of Dundee from Scotland (FIM 1,432,500), and Burmeister & Wain from Denmark (FIM 1,422,500). When a fifth tender for FIM 1,485,000 was received from the English shipbuilder R. & W. Hawthorn Leslie and Company nine days after the deadline, Armstrong Whitworth lowered their bid by 100,000 markkas to FIM 1,475,000. Wärtsilä Hietalahti shipyard was also asked to participate in the call for tenders, but the domestic shipbuilding was not yet ready to accept such demanding projects and there were difficulties in acquiring and importing steel suitable for icebreakers. The tenders were evaluated by an expert committee appointed by the Senate and, after careful consideration, the icebreaker offered by Armstrong Whitworth turned out to be the most suitable. A number of changes were proposed to the original design including moving the bow propeller slightly abaft and upwards to protect it from grounding and improve the icebreaking characteristics of the ship by reducing the stem angle to 20 degrees. The shipbuilding contract was signed on 15 February 1907, and with the proposed changes the price of the vessel was 1,631,548.81 <b>Finnish</b> <b>markkas.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Finnish</b> <b>markka</b> ( [...] , , {{currency}} code:FIM) was {{the currency}} of Finland from 1860 until 28 February 2002, when it ceased to be legal tender. [...] The markka {{was replaced by the}} euro (€), which had been introduced, in cash form, on 1 January 2002, after a transitional period of three years when the euro was the official currency but only existed as 'book money'. The dual circulation period – when both the <b>Finnish</b> <b>markka</b> and the euro had legal tender status – ended on 28 February 2002.|$|E
2500|$|Originally named Birka Princess, {{the ship}} was built by the Finnish {{state-owned}} company Valmet at their Vuosaari shipyard in Helsinki [...] {{at a cost of}} 350 million <b>Finnish</b> <b>markka</b> (€58,9 million). She was delivered in 1986 and operated for Birka Line in the Baltic Sea cruiseferry market, sailing on 24-hour cruises between Stockholm in Sweden and the Åland Islands in Finland. Between 1990 and 2003 she also made longer cruises around the Baltic Sea during the summer season.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the latter}} half of its {{independent}} history, Finland has maintained a mixed economy. Since its post-World War II economic boom in the 1970s, Finland's GDP per capita has been among the world's highest. [...] The expanded welfare state of Finland from 1970 and 1990 increased the public sector employees and spending and the tax burden imposed on the citizens. In 1992, Finland simultaneously faced economic overheating and depressed Western, Russian, and local markets. Finland joined the European Union in 1995, and replaced the <b>Finnish</b> <b>markka</b> with the euro in 2002. According to a 2016 poll, 61% of Finns preferred not to join NATO.|$|E
25|$|In April 1930, the Parliament of Finland allotted 4,000,000 <b>Finnish</b> <b>markkas</b> for {{procuring}} a second-hand full-rigged {{ship and}} refitting it {{as a school}} ship for the Finnish Navy. During the summer of 1930, the Finnish officials inspected a number of Finnish and foreign ships that were offered for sale. These included Gustav Erikson's four-masted barques Pommern and Herzogin Cecilie, and several other ships, but all were deemed either too large or too dilapidated. In the end, the most suitable candidate came from Germany where Oldenburg, a 28-year-old former school ship of the German merchant navy, was offered for sale. After inspecting the ship in Bremen, the Finnish officials purchased her in August 1930 and the German crew sailed the ship to Helsinki.|$|R
25|$|When {{the winter}} {{navigation}} committee {{appointed by the}} Senate of Finland in 1895 decided that the state-owned icebreakers would assist merchant ships only to the port of Hanko during the winter, the shipowners from Turku did not lose their faith in year-round traffic to their hometown. In 1898 they founded a joint shipping company, Isbrytare Aktiebolaget Avance (Icebreaker Company Avance), to order and maintain an icebreaker {{that would be used}} to maintain year-round traffic to the port of Turku. The new company was partially funded by the city and also received a long-term interest-free loan from the state. With total assets of 650,000 <b>Finnish</b> <b>markkas</b> (FIM) the company ordered a new icebreaker, designed by Swedish engineer C. Bagge, from the Howaldtswerke shipyard in Kiel, Germany. The total cost of the new vessel, christened Avance, was FIM 616,000 and in many respects she resembled the first state-owned icebreaker, Murtaja. She was completed and delivered to owners in February 1899.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was when}} KGB agent Reino Häyhänen ( [...] Eugene Nicolai Mäki) wanted to defect in May 1957 from Paris, that the FBI {{was able to}} link the nickel to KGB agents, {{including}} Mikhail Nikolaevich Svirin (a former United Nations employee) and Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher. Häyhänen was being recalled to Moscow for good, and defected {{on the way back}} in Paris. The deciphered message in the nickel turned out to be only a personal message to Häyhänen from the KGB in Moscow welcoming him to the U.S. and instructing him on getting set up. He gave the FBI the information that it needed to crack the cipher, uncover the identity of his two main contacts in New York (Svirin and Fisher), and a nearly identically made <b>Finnish</b> 50 <b>Markka</b> coin.|$|R
2500|$|As a {{temporary}} measure {{to cover for}} the rising passenger numbers Thomesto Oy, {{another member of the}} Finnlines consortium, purchased the 1966-built [...] and placed it in Finnlines traffic in 1973. On 5 December 1973 Enso-Gutzeit placed an order for project Finnjet with the Wärtsilä Hietalahti shipyard in Helsinki, Finland. The cost of the ship has been estimated at being between 200–300 million <b>Finnish</b> <b>markka,</b> making her the largest investment made to Finnish tourism by that time. At the time Finnjet was in fact planned as the first in a pair of identical sisters.

50|$|In 1863 Snellman {{was called}} to a cabinet post in the Senate of Finland, in effect as Chancellor of the Exchequer, where he became an {{energetic}} and valued senator, accomplishing a language decree from the Emperor, that gradually would give Finnish a position {{equal to that of}} Swedish within the Finnish government, and thereby practically in Finland at large, the re-establishment of the Parliament, that had remained inhibited since the Russian conquest, and finally the introduction of a separate <b>Finnish</b> currency, the <b>Markka,</b> in 1865, that came to be of the utmost value for Finland. Snellman's tenure as Finance Minister would however also be tainted by the worst famine in Finnish history, aggravated by the government's strict fiscal policy.|$|R
40|$|The First World War was {{an immense}} {{economic}} shock {{also for the}} Finnish economy. As the war began, Finland, as the Grand Duchy of Russia, was cut off from its main export market in Western Europe. During the first war years, however, Russian war-related demand boosted Finnish exports and industry (metal and textiles). This boom ended in bust after the Russian revolution. Furthermore, the Finnish Civil War in 1918 aggravated the crisis. The peg of the <b>Finnish</b> currency <b>markka</b> to the ruble (until 1917) and a deficit in state finances fueled inflation: the price level increased about elevenfold before the markka was stabilized in the early 1920 s. Because the labor movement lost the civil war, its political position was rather weak after 1918. This paper analyzes these turbulent years {{from the viewpoint of}} the labor market in examining the development of nominal and real wages of manufacturing workers, focusing on the four main industries: sawmill, paper and pulp, metal and textile industries. We show that the asymmetrical shocks they faced caused great variation in their wage and employment development. A comparison with Sweden, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States shows that the relative position of manufacturing workers (real earnings/real GDP per capita) developed more favorably in the deflation economies (Sweden, the UK, and the USA) than in the inflation economies (Finland and France). </div...|$|R
