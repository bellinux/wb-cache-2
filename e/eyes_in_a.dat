5|$|Montagu {{was created}} Earl of Salisbury on 16 March 1337. This {{was one of}} six comital {{promotions}} Edward III made that day, in preparation for {{what was to become}} the Hundred Years' War. To allow Montagu to support his new status, the king granted him land and rent of a value of 1000 marks a year. The money was provided from the royal stannaries of Cornwall. A contemporary poem tells of a vow made by the earl {{on the eve of the}} warshe would not open one of his eyes while fighting in France. The story is probably a satire; the truth was that Montagu had already lost the use of one of his <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tournament.|$|E
5|$|Many {{performances}} {{deal with}} behaviors {{that occur in}} daily life. However, {{in accordance with the}} overriding principle of beauty, such behaviors are stylized to be presented on stage. Peking opera does not aim to accurately represent reality. Experts of the art form contrast the principles of Peking opera with the principle of Mo, mimes or imitation, that is found in western dramas. Peking opera should be suggestive, not imitative. The literal aspects of scenes are removed or stylized to better represent intangible emotions and characters. The most common stylization method in Peking opera is roundness. Every motion and pose is carefully manipulated to avoid sharp angles and straight lines. A character looking upon an object above them will sweep their <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> circular motion from low to high before landing on the object. Similarly, a character will sweep their hand in an arc from left to right in order to indicate an object on the right. This avoidance of sharp angles extends to three-dimensional movement as well; reversals of orientation often {{take the form of a}} smooth, S-shaped curve. All of these general principles of aesthetics are present within other performance elements as well.|$|E
25|$|Extinction {{frequency}} {{may also}} be affected by reporting method, due to how visual processing interacts {{with the rest of}} the brain. Reported extinctions drop when the patient is told to relay the extinction news by a method other than speaking – particularly, the use of the <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> feedback loop (looking to the side if there is a single stimuli, and up if there are two). This may work by eliminating the need for hemispheric transfer of information – routing the response to the motor cortex instead of the visual cortex – and so shortening the path and response time, a conclusion supported by increased detection of isolated contralesional stimuli under such circumstances.|$|E

25|$|Combining {{the brain}} bias towards facial {{processing}} and surface discovery, a follow-up study by Dr. Vuilleumier exposed subjects to paired visual stimuli in three phases. In the initial phase, stimuli were simply bilateral pairs, and extinction frequency was measured. In the next stage, the stimuli were surrounded with an oval, {{so that they}} appeared to represent <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> face. The extinction rate for this appearance was greatly reduced. Finally, the patients were shown the stimuli minus the contextual oval – however, the reduced extinction rate persisted, as though the patients had learned to group these stimuli. The effect did not occur when the stimuli were surrounded by a nonoval shape, pointing towards facial processing as being {{the key to this}} phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Rotti phones Shilo {{and invites}} {{her to the}} Opera, {{delivering}} her mother's burial dress for her to wear. Nathan finds the GeneCops searching his basement. They try to arrest Nathan, but he quickly dispatches them and heads to the opera looking for Shilo. At the opera, Amber takes the stage for her premiere, but her performance is ruined when her transplanted face falls off. Mag takes to the stage and sings her final song. She deviates from the song's grand finale, denouncing the Largo family and gouging out her <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> final act of defiance. Rotti cuts the cords suspending Mag, dropping and impaling her on a fence. Rotti assures everyone that Mag's death {{is part of the}} performance and convinces the audience to stay seated.|$|E
25|$|Eyes are {{internal}} {{liberties of}} a group of stones that, like external liberties, prevent the group's capture, but unlike external liberties are much harder for an opponent to fill due to the only way to kill a group with an eye is to fill all of its liberties before calling atari. The presence or absence of <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> group determine life or death of that group. A group with no eyes, or only one eye, will die unless its owner can develop them. Conversely, a group with two or more eyes will live. An opponent cannot capture such a group because it is impossible to remove all liberties of the group by playing one stone, without violating the suicide rule.|$|E

25|$|Correct potato {{husbandry}} can be {{an arduous}} task in some circumstances. Good ground preparation, harrowing, plowing, and rolling are always needed, along with a little grace from the weather and {{a good source of}} water. Three successive plowings, with associated harrowing and rolling, are desirable before planting. Eliminating all root-weeds is desirable in potato cultivation. In general, the potatoes themselves are grown from the eyes of another potato and not from seed. Home gardeners often plant a piece of potato with two or three <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hill of mounded soil. Commercial growers plant potatoes as a row crop using seed tubers, young plants or microtubers and may mound the entire row. Seed potato crops are 'rogued' in some countries to eliminate diseased plants or those of a different variety from the seed crop.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{most often}} first appear in early {{childhood}} (the toddler stage) when children begin to walk. Though they usually start walking at a normal age, they wobble or sway when walking, standing still or sitting, and may appear {{almost as if they}} are drunk. In late pre-school and early school age, they develop difficulty moving their <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> natural manner from one place to the next (oculomotor apraxia). They develop slurred or distorted speech, and swallowing problems. Some have an increased number of respiratory tract infections (ear infections, sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia). Because not all children develop in the same manner or at the same rate, it may be some years before A-T is properly diagnosed. Most children with A-T have stable neurologic symptoms for the first 4–5 years of life, but begin to show increasing problems in early school years.|$|E
25|$|After {{destroying}} part of Tokyo {{with shock}} waves generated by her beating wings, Megaguirus {{heads to the}} waterfront and faces Godzilla. Being territorial, Megaguirus considers the city to be her hunting ground. As they engage in a lengthy battle, she uses her speed to avoid Godzilla's attacks, but Godzilla eventually uses his speed against her. As she flies toward Godzilla, it lunges forward with its dorsal fins in her path. She flies into the fins, {{and one of her}} arms is severed. Megaguirus, having been mutated by Godzilla's energy, generates a blast similar to Godzilla's atomic breath and knocks Godzilla down. Megaguirus speeds forward with the stinger on her long tail lowered, trying to stab Godzilla between the <b>eyes.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> climactic moment, Godzilla catches the stinger in its mouth and crushes it in its jaws. Godzilla finally blasts Megaguirus with atomic breath, causing her to burst into flames and die.|$|E

25|$|In 1328, the {{population}} of the city was about 200,000, which made it the most populous city in Europe. With the growth in population came growing social tensions; the first riots took place in December 1306 against the Provost of the Merchants, who was accused of raising rents. The houses of many merchants were burned, and twenty-eight rioters were hanged. In January 1357, Étienne Marcel, the Provost of Paris, led a merchants' revolt using violence (such as the killing of the councillors of the dauphin before his very <b>eyes)</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bid to curb the power of the monarchy and obtain privileges for the city and the Estates General, which had {{met for the first time}} in Paris in 1347. After initial concessions by the Crown, the city was retaken by royalist forces in 1358. Marcel was killed and his followers dispersed (a number of which were later put to death).|$|E
500|$|Olivier's {{dermatomyositis}} {{meant he}} spent {{the last three months}} of 1974 in hospital, and he spent early 1975 slowly recovering and regaining his strength. When strong enough, he was contacted by the director John Schlesinger, who offered him the role of a Nazi torturer in the 1976 film Marathon Man. Olivier shaved his pate and wore oversized glasses to enlarge the look of his <b>eyes,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> role that the critic David Robinson, writing for The Times, thought was [...] "strongly played", adding that Olivier was [...] "always at his best in roles that call for him to be seedy or nasty or both". Olivier was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, and won the Golden Globe of the same category.|$|E
500|$|Moreover, {{according}} to Robinson, the series' final scene, in which Korra and Asami gaze into each other's <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shot mirroring {{the composition of}} Avatars final moments in which Aang and Katara kiss, [...] "changed the face of TV" [...] by going further than any other work of children's television in depicting same-sex relationships– an assessment shared by reviewers for TV.com, The A.V. Club, USA Today, IGN and Moviepilot. Mike Hoffman, on the other hand, felt that Korra and Asami's relationship was not intended as particularly subversive, but as something the writers trusted younger viewers, now often familiar with same-sex relationships, to be mature enough to understand. Megan Farokhmanesh of Polygon wrote that by portraying Korra and Asami as bisexual, the series even avoided the error of assuming sexual orientation, as many other TV series did, to be a strict divide between [...] "gay" [...] and [...] "straight".|$|E

500|$|The [...] are a {{small group}} of immortal beings, often called (by both {{themselves}} and others) [...] Referred to as gods by some, but unknown to the major religions in Ivalice, the Occuria race played a vital role in the history of Ivalice such as the creation of the Espers and granting power to King Raithwall to conquer the countries of Ivalice with the Dawn, Dusk, and Midlight shards of nethicite. The Occuria were first designed to be a race of Mindflayers, a type of enemy monster in the game. Earlier concept artwork portrayed these [...] "Mindflayers" [...] as wearing luxurious robes and turbans and lounging in a bar and smoking pipes. The design was changed during development and the Mindflayer was placed as a special monster, retaining the initial design; the Occuria were then given a different design of glowing <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mist-like form.|$|E
500|$|Hard Candy was {{released}} on April 25, 2008, in the European countries of Germany, Ireland, Austria and Netherlands. On April 28, the album {{was released}} in the United Kingdom, Brazil and {{throughout the rest of}} Europe, and on April 29, in the United States, Mexico and Canada. Billboard reported that the title of the album was Licorice, as announced on the Sirius Satellite Radio programme OutQ. In an interview with MTV Australia, Madonna explained that a prominent theme of the Hard Candy album was about incorporating the image of a boxer, an idea which has been repeated within the song [...] "Give It 2 Me". According to her, [...] " [...] is basically [...] I'm not , 'give me all you got' , so it's quite a sort of tough stance." [...] Hence, initially Madonna decided that the title of the song was to be used for the then-unnamed album. This was changed following the release of a similarly named song by Timbaland. After that, Madonna decided to call the album Black Madonna, and even shot a photograph for the cover art, wearing blackface make-up with white <b>eyes.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> 2009 interview with Rolling Stone Madonna commented: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{shell of}} the Antarctic scallop grows to about [...] long and 7 {{centimetres}} wide and has a nearly circular outline. The two purplish-red valves are paper thin [...] and only slightly convex and are attached by a long, slightly sinuous, hinge. Near the hinge there is an umbo or beak on each valve, a raised hump from which the ribs radiate. The umbones are not very prominent and {{on either side of}} them are irregular winged processes, the auricles. In smaller specimens there are around 12 shallow ribs diverging from the umbones and further low ridges appear between these as the shell grows larger. There is a fine sculpturing of concentric lines {{on the outside of the}} valves. The auricles are also finely sculpted with the annual growth lines visible. The interior of the valves is pink. A fringe of numerous small tentacles project from the mantle between the two valves and there are a number of simple <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> row around the rim. The valves are held closed by powerful adductor muscles which work in opposition to an elastic ligament that lies just behind the umbones and which tends to open the valves. The flanges of the auricles provide a wide attachment for this ligament. The Antarctic scallop could be confused with other scallops, other bivalves or lamp shells.|$|E

500|$|Others {{have argued}} that the film is itself a metaphor for filmmaking, and that the filmgoing {{experience}} itself, images flashing before one's <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> darkened room, is akin to a dream. Writing in Wired, Jonah Lehrer supported this interpretation and presented neurological evidence that brain activity is strikingly similar during film-watching and sleeping. In both, the visual cortex is highly active and the prefrontal cortex, which deals with logic, deliberate analysis, and self-awareness, is quiet. Paul argued that the experience of going to a picturehouse is itself an exercise in shared dreaming, particularly when viewing Inception: the film's sharp cutting between scenes forces the viewer to create larger narrative arcs to stitch the pieces together. This demand of production parallel to consumption of the images, {{on the part of the}} audience is analogous to dreaming itself. As in the film's story, in a cinema one enters into the space of another's dream, in this case Nolan's, as with any work of art, one's reading of it is ultimately influenced by one's own subjective desires and subconscious. At Bir-Hakeim bridge in Paris, Ariadne creates an illusion of infinity by adding facing mirrors underneath its struts, Stephanie Dreyfus in la Croix asked [...] "Is this not a strong, beautiful metaphor for the cinema and its power of illusion?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In addition, other {{patterns}} have {{a similar}} look: in particular, some forms of sabino and splash may be confused with each other, or the two patterns may exist in the same horse.

[...] The genetic mechanisms behind certain traits, such as blue <b>eyes</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few Arabian horses with otherwise minimal markings, {{have yet to be}} identified, though there is speculation that splash genes could be involved.|$|E
