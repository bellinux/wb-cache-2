2500|$|In {{response}} to the strategic plan, an Academic Strategic Plan was drafted by Provost Martha Potvin and the deans of the university's colleges in late 2012. The academic plan put maintaining MSU's research funding and activity as its top goal. Other top goals included expanding enrollment by 15 percent by 2019 (to 16,000 students), enhancing research even further, and improving community service by faculty and staff. To achieve the research goal, the plan called for {{increasing the number of}} graduate students by 20 percent, increasing the number of doctoral students by 43 percent, and renovating lab space. Other goals in the plan included improving faculty salaries, improving <b>financial</b> <b>aid</b> <b>to</b> <b>students,</b> enhancing career guidance and counseling to graduating students, hiring more minority faculty (including Native Americans), renovating classrooms, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent, and reducing landfill waste by 25 percent. But comments on the draft academic plan said MSU had no plan to pay for the additional faculty, classrooms, and laboratories that a greatly expanded student body would require. Potvin said the university would pay for them by [...] "prioritizing". A member of the Board of Regents said the plan did not take into account initiatives by the regents or legislature, such as improving the time to graduation (as of 2012 between five and six years).|$|E
