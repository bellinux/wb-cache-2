5|$|Just as the Black Codes, enacted {{after the}} Civil War to {{restrict}} {{the free exercise of}} those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes. And when racial discrimination herds men into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin, then it too is a relic of slavery.|$|E
5|$|Like most felines, the bobcat {{is largely}} solitary, but ranges often overlap. Unusual for cats, males are more {{tolerant}} of overlap, while females rarely wander into others' ranges.

When multiple territories overlap, a dominance hierarchy is often established, resulting in the <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> some transients from favored areas.|$|E

50|$|Although this {{provision}} prevented routine <b>exclusions</b> <b>of</b> liability for gross negligence, misconduct or fraud by operators, {{it did not}} disturb the protection afforded by section 1 of the Carriers Act 1830 (limitation of liability {{for the loss of}} certain goods above £10), or abridge the right to contact out of strict liability.|$|R
5|$|There {{have been}} critiques {{of the theory}} from several perspectives. Arguments include that it {{emphasizes}} justice to the <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> other moral values, such as caring; {{that there is such}} an overlap between stages that they should more properly be regarded as separate domains; or that evaluations of the reasons for moral choices are mostly post hoc rationalizations (by both decision makers and psychologists studying them) of essentially intuitive decisions.|$|E

5|$|A {{professional}} football career was unlikely for Willis when {{he graduated from}} Ohio State in 1945. While the <b>exclusion</b> <b>of</b> black players was not a written rule, no African-American had played in the National Football League since 1933. The gentlemen's agreement had been in effect ever since segregationist George Preston Marshall entered the league as owner of the Boston Redskins. In his physical prime but with no real prospect of playing professionally, Willis {{took a job as}} the head football coach at Kentucky State College in the fall of 1945. Kentucky State, an historically black school, played against other small black schools near its campus in Frankfort.|$|E

The early actions have been credited with preparing the gay community for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power.|$|E
