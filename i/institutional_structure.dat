5|$|Biko and SASO were openly {{critical}} of NUSAS' protests against government policies. Biko argued that NUSAS merely sought {{to influence the}} white electorate; in his opinion, this electorate was not legitimate, and protests targeting a particular policy would be ineffective for the ultimate aim of dismantling the apartheid state. SASO regarded student marches, pickets, and strikes to be ineffective and stated it would withdraw from public forms of protest. It deliberately avoided open confrontation with the state until such a point when it had a sufficiently large <b>institutional</b> <b>structure.</b> Instead, SASO's focus was on establishing community projects and spreading Black Consciousness ideas among other black organisations and the wider black community. Despite this policy, in May 1972 it issued the Alice Declaration, in which it called for students to boycott lectures {{in response to the}} expulsion of SASO member Abram Onkgopotse Tiro from the University of the North after he made a speech criticising its administration. The Tiro incident convinced the government that SASO was a threat.|$|E

This framework focuses on how <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> within societies change and the impact of this change on the strategy and structure of firms and their ability to compete in global markets. In contrast to other forms of institutionalist analysis described herein, the comparative capitalisms framework focuses on the complexity of internal <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> and their degrees of complementarity and change brought about by powerful actors. It also examines how international pressures for homogeneity in <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> are mediated by politics and power. It illustrates these themes through examining the comparative capitalisms approach to the study of emerging economies in Eastern Europe and Asia and to the impact of multinationals and transnational systems of regulation on local <b>institutional</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

40|$|For decades {{there has}} been a concern that {{citizens}} in Britain and other western democracies are disengaging from political processes. Furthermore, Robert Putnam (2000) argues that the decline in engagement is connected to a decline in social capital. Recent citizenship philosophies from authors such as Etzioni (2000) and Blond (2009) attempt to address this concern by arguing for the development of mutual and associative communities. Although Etzioni (2000) and Putnam (2000) argue that the state can help develop social capital and thus mutual and associative communities through government policy, other such as Field (2003) discussion some potential problems for this and argue that government policy focused on increasing social capital can be counterproductive. This project explores this problem using qualitative research methods conducting semi-structured interviews lasting between 30 - 70 minutes each. 16 people were interviewed from three different engagement groups categorised as formal, semi-formal and informal which allowed for comparing the affects of government policy, or <b>institutional</b> <b>structures,</b> on the respective engagement groups. This project concludes that whilst <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> do not necessarily impede social capital and thus engagement; <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> that dictate homogeneous engagement or <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> that only support bureaucratic normative structures were found to have negative consequences for social capital and political engagement. However, it is also argued that within the specific groups studied, <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> can also have positive effects on social capital and engagement when they do not crowd out individual exploration within communal and/or associative structures in the community. Finally, this project argues that the conclusions cannot be fully generalised throughout British society {{because of the nature of}} the qualitative methods used, and because social capital is a context specific social phenomenon. As a result, it is argued that the conclusions can and should be used as hypotheses for future studies into the effects of <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> on political engagement...|$|R
40|$|Purpose -The {{intention}} {{of this paper}} is to explore the ways in which discrimination is exercised institutionally. The paper takes as its focus the U. K. <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> of accountancy. Design/methodology/approach- The paper uses a conceptual framework which explores the connections between <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> of U. K. accountancy and the rich experiences of individuals. Findings - The narrative themes clearly illustrate the intersection of gender, ethnicity and identity across the <b>institutional</b> <b>structures.</b> Varying degrees of inclusion and exclusion are visible in the accountancy workplace. Research Limitations - The oral history approach has its inherent limitations and many of the respondents were ‘snowball’ contacts rather than drawn from a large randomly chosen selection. Practical implications- This paper prioritises individual experience of unfair discrimination. Although research in this area of accountancy is emergent, it argues that the voice of the individual needs to be listened to by the institutions which form U. K. accountancy in order to facilitate equality and diversity. Originality/value- The value of this study rests with the illumination of accountancy experiences which otherwise may have been silenced by the <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> of accountancy...|$|R

25|$|William Seward {{contemplated}} {{this potential}} in the 1840s, when the Democrats were the nation's majority party, usually controlling Congress, the presidency, and many state offices. The country's <b>institutional</b> <b>structure</b> and party system allowed slaveholders to prevail in more of the nation's territories and to garner {{a great deal of}} influence over national policy. With growing popular discontent with the unwillingness of many Democratic leaders to take a stand against slavery, and growing consciousness of the party's increasingly pro-Southern stance, Seward became convinced that the only way for the Whig Party to counteract the Democrats' strong monopoly of the rhetoric of democracy and equality was for the Whigs to embrace anti-slavery as a party platform. Once again, to increasing numbers of Northerners, the Southern labor system was increasingly seen as contrary to the ideals of American democracy.|$|E
25|$|The {{conquest of}} the Byzantine capital of Constantinople—which the Turks called Istanbul—in 1453 enabled the Ottomans to {{consolidate}} their empire in Anatolia and Thrace. The Ottomans later revived the title of caliph {{during the reign of}} Sultan Selim. Despite the absence of a formal <b>institutional</b> <b>structure,</b> Sunni religious functionaries played an important political role. Justice was dispensed by religious courts; in theory, the codified system of şeriat regulated all aspects of life, at least for the Muslim subjects of the empire. The head of the judiciary ranked directly below the sultan and was second in power only to the grand vizier. Early in the Ottoman period, the office of grand mufti of Istanbul evolved into that of Şeyhülislam (shaykh, or leader of Islam), which had ultimate jurisdiction over all the courts in the empire and consequently exercised authority over the interpretation and application of şeriat. Legal opinions pronounced by the Şeyhülislam were considered definitive interpretations.|$|E
25|$|The Round Table {{agreement}} of 18 September encompassed six draft laws that covered {{an overhaul of}} the Constitution, establishment of a Constitutional Court, the functioning and management of political parties, multiparty elections for National Assembly deputies, the penal code and the law on penal procedures (the last two changes represented an additional separation of the Party from the state apparatus). The electoral system was a compromise: about half of the deputies would be elected proportionally and half by the majoritarian system. A weak presidency was also agreed upon, but no consensus was attained on who should elect the president (parliament or the people) and when this election should occur (before or after parliamentary elections). On 7 October 1989, the Communist Party at its last congress re-established itself as the Hungarian Socialist Party. In a historic session from 16 to 20 October, the parliament adopted legislation providing for multi-party parliamentary elections and a direct presidential election, which took place on March 24, 1990. The legislation transformed Hungary from a People's Republic into the Republic of Hungary, guaranteed human and civil rights, and created an <b>institutional</b> <b>structure</b> that ensured separation of powers among the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of government. The Soviet military occupation of Hungary, which had persisted since World War II, ended on 19 June 1991.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the important question}} of how <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> matter to the delivery of climate change policy for urban transport. It examines the strategic goals, policy tools in operation and initial progress towards carbon emission reduction in seven cities across the UK and Germany where different <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> exist. The UK has {{the presence of a}} strong national carbon target and strong hierarchical national-local government relationships whilst Germany has a more integrated system of local transport provision in a context where local and regional government is stronger. Our findings show that the carbon agenda has made very little difference to what is happening {{on the ground in the}} cities. Across all sites, progress is being made but largely through technological improvements which are being almost completely offset by population growth. Even in the more integrated city environments there has not be an additional stimulus to manage the demand for travel. Contrary to previous research therefore, we cannot conclude that <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> are paramount in delivering effective carbon reduction policies. The <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> in the UK and in Germany are not perfectly aligned to carbon management but, given the cross policy impacts of most transport interventions, this is perhaps inevitable. We can clearly conclude however that “better” structures are not sufficient to achieve the implementation of more effective carbon policies. Whilst <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> must matter, it is the broader governance environment and the resources and politics involved in transport policy that seem to dominate the importance of the carbon agenda and implementation paths that emerge...|$|R

25|$|From {{the early}} Christians, early medieval Christians {{inherited}} a church united by major creeds, a stable Biblical canon, and a well-developed philosophical tradition. The history of medieval Christianity traces Christianity during the Middle Ages—the period {{after the fall}} of the Roman Empire until the Protestant Reformation. The <b>institutional</b> <b>structure</b> of Christianity in the west during this period is different from what it would become later in the Middle Ages. As opposed to the later church, the church of the early Middle Ages consisted primarily of the monasteries. The practice of simony has caused the ecclesiastical offices to become the property of local princes, and as such the monasteries constituted the only church institution independent of the local princes. In addition, the papacy was relatively weak, and its power was mostly confined to central Italy. Individualized religious practice was uncommon, as it typically required membership in a religious order, such as the Order of Saint Benedict. Religious orders wouldn't proliferate until the high Middle Ages. For the typical Christian at this time, religious participation was largely confined to occasionally receiving mass from wandering monks. Few would be lucky enough to receive this as often as once a month. By the end of this period, individual practice of religion was becoming more common, as monasteries started to transform into something approximating modern churches, where some monks might even give occasional sermons.|$|E
500|$|Yet {{another option}} is to create the UNPA as a nongovernmental {{organization}} of democratically elected legislators. This would have the advantage of not requiring the cooperation of (sometimes dictatorial) national governments or world parliamentary organizations with dictatorial members, so only democratic legislators, parliaments and countries would be represented. The World Constitution and Parliament Association and other NGOs have attempted to set up workable parliaments. Dieter Heinrich critiqued this approach by saying, [...] "If it did succeed on any scale, it would divert resources from pressuring governments on thousands of specific issues, which citizens are good at, into the operation of a pan-global <b>institutional</b> <b>structure,</b> which citizens' groups are ill equipped to do...And the resulting assembly would always be of doubtful legitimacy (who does it really represent?) and of unlikely value as an evolutionary starting point for a real world parliament." ...|$|E

The ECSC secretariat moved from Luxembourg to the merged body Council secretariat in the Ravenstein building of Brussels. In 1971 the Council and its secretariat moved into the Charlemagne building, next to the Commission's Berlaymont. These premises rapidly proved insufficient and the administrative branch of the secretariat moved to a building at 76 Rue Joseph II/Jozef II-straat. During the 1980s the language divisions moved out into the Nerviens, Frère Orban and Guimard buildings.|$|E
