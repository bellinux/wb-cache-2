40|$|Bifunctional {{redox flow}} {{batteries}} (BRFB) possess functions of both electricity storage and electrochemical preparation, having {{the potential for}} increasing the electrical energy utilization. A V(III) /V(II) -glyoxal(O- 2) system has been developed. Separators of the BRFB {{play a key role}} in BRFB performance. A Nation solution was sprayed on a gas diffusion layer (GDL) at the Nafion loading of 2 mg cm(- 2), and the GDL was then hot-pressed onto a Nafion 115 cation exchange membrane, obtaining a modified separator. This separator not only prevents the crossover of vanadium but also has favorable conductivity, obtaining optimal charge and organic <b>electro-synthesis</b> performance of the BRFB. The effects of the concentrations of glyoxal and HCl on the performance of BRFB were also investigated. It is shown that the optimal concentration of glyoxal and HCl should be 1. 2 and 3 M, respectively. As a result, the current efficiency of organic <b>electro-synthesis</b> is further increased. An acceptable discharge performance is achieved for a period exceeding 20 h at the current density of 20 mA cm(- 2). The average discharge voltage of 0. 73 V and the coulombic efficiency of 66 % are obtained. It is demonstrated that the principle of the BRFB is feasible. However, further experiments are needed to improve the performance. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Conducting diamond {{thin film}} is a new {{electrode}} material that has received great attention recently because it possesses several technologically important characteristics such as an inert surface with low adsorption properties, remarkable corrosion stability, even in strong acidic media, and an extremely wide potential window in aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes.

30|$|Electrochemical {{polymerization}} is {{a convenient}} method to prepare PEDOT, and generally a film yields {{on the surface}} of the anode. The <b>electro-synthesis</b> can be done both in organic and aqueous solutions. Due to the low solubility of EDOT in water at room temperature, previous research on the electro-polymerization of PEDOT was usually done in an organic solution, such as acetonitrile and propylene carbonate [10, 11]. Recently, there are growing interests in the study of electro-polymerization of PEDOT films in an aqueous solution [12 – 19]. It is known that the properties of conducting polymers are strongly dependent on their morphologies and their physical and chemical structures. Polypyrrole micro-containers have been synthesized electrochemically by direct oxidation of pyrrole monomer in an aqueous solution [20, 21]. Surfactants were often used to control the morphology of the PEDOT film with electrochemical methods recently [12 – 17]. Sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS) has also been used in the <b>electro-synthesis</b> of PEDOT with different morphologies (globular and fibrous) [12]. PEDOT/PSS (poly(4 -styrene sulfonate)) film with microstructures of micro-rings/arrows and bubbles has been prepared with the cyclic voltammetry method and the influences of applied potentials and surfactant (PSS) on the morphology of the resulted film were also investigated [13]. PEDOT micro-cups with diameters in the range of 1 to 4 mm were generated by direct oxidation of EDOT in the aqueous solution of LiClO 4 and tri (ethylene glycol (EG)) on the ITO electrode with a PSS/PDDA multilayer coating [19].|$|E

The study considers the analysis of mild and sustainable conditions to obtain cyclic carbonates from CO 2 recycling.

After this, the electro-catalytic effect of the modified electrode on ascorbic acid was examined using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and a very strong response was observed. A negative shift of about 0. 33 V was found in the peak anodic potentials for ascorbic acid.

40|$|Electroactive polymer {{actuators}} such as polypyrrole (PPy) are exciting {{candidates to}} drive autonomous devices that require low weight and low power. A simple PPy tri-layer bending type cantilever which operates {{in the air}} has been demonstrated previously, but the environmental effect on this actuator is still unknown. The major obstacle {{in the development of}} the PPy tri-layer actuator is to create proper packaging that reduces oxidation of the electrolyte and maintains constant displacement. Here, we report the variation in the displacement as well as the charge transfer at the different environmental condition. PPy trilayer actuators were fabricated by depositing polypyrrole on gold-coated porous poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) using the <b>electro-synthesis</b> method. It has been demonstrated that the charge transfer of tri-layer actuators is more in an inert environment than in open air. In addition, tri-layer actuators show constant deflection and enhancement of life due to the negligible oxidation rate of the electrolyte in an inert environment...|$|E
40|$|Electrochemical supercapacitors (ES) {{have become}} an {{attractive}} technology in electrical energy storage devices and found many applications {{in a number of}} areas. The development of ES requires fabrication of advanced electrodes with novel materials and new techniques. Conducting polymer polypyrrole (PPy) {{has been found to be}} a promising electrode for ES due to its high pseudo capacitance and good elctrical conductivity. The polypyrrole based composite electrode with multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) has been proved to enhance the electrochemical performance ofES. Anodic electrochemical deposition of polypyrrole film and composite with MWCNTs has been successfully achieved on a stainless steel substrates in aqueous solutions. Novel additives, such as tiron (4, 5 -dihydroxy- 1, 3 -benzenedisulfonic acid disodium salt) and sodium salicylate have been employed for the <b>electro-synthesis</b> ofPPy.

40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} the impact of {{different}} <b>electro-synthesis</b> processes, used to produce poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) –poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT–PSS) systems in aqueous medium, on the polymer backbone and its electro-catalytic activity. FE-SEM and micro-Raman spectroscopy were used to analyze the samples obtained by varying the conditions of the electro-polymerization processes. The I 2 /I redox behaviour of various PEDOT–PSS layers has been comparatively examined in relation to the surface morphology and structural characteristics of the polymer. A response similar to that of a conventional Pt electrode has been revealed for the films produced by chronoamperometric technique. The study has demonstrated that the polymer structure {{plays an important role in}} the electro-activity, providing a possibility to improve the redox performance of PEDOT–PSS films by a proper choice of the synthesis methods.

The product showed light brown powder which upon activation becomes dark brown. Optimum condition achieved during use voltage of 15 Volts {{and at a}} temperature of 40 °C with 33 % yield. The obtained material was characterized by XRD and compared to CCDC 640536 simulated patterns to confirm the phase purity of the product. As comparison hydrothermal and reflux method have been carried out. Characterization by FTIR has also undertaken to ensure the coordination between the metal cation (Fe 3 +) and the BTC ligand (BTC = 1, 3, 5 -Benzene Tri Carboxylate). Meanwhile pore analysis using SAA confirmed that MIL- 100 (Fe) obtained by electrolysis method has a BET surface area reached till 569. 191 m²/g with a total pore volume of 0. 4540 cc/g and an average pore diameter reached 16 Å. Based on SEM analysis, morphology material show particle size between 0. 4 - 8. 6 μm and has a thermal stability up to 350 °C according thermo-gravimetric analysis.

40|$|International audienceThe direct CO 2 {{electrochemical}} reduction on model platinum single crystal electrodes Pt(hkl) is studied in [C 2 mim(+) ][NTf 2 (-) ], a suitable room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) medium {{due to its}} moderate viscosity, high CO 2 solubility and conductivity. Single crystal electrodes represent the most convenient type of surface structured electrodes for studying the impact of RTIL ion adsorption on relevant electrocatalytic reactions, such as surface sensitive electrochemical CO 2 reduction. We propose here based on cyclic voltammetry and in situ electrolysis measurements, for the first time, {{the formation of a}} stable adduct [C 2 mimH-CO 2 (-) ] by a radical-radical coupling after the simultaneous reduction of CO 2 and [C 2 mim(+) ]. It means between the CO 2 radical anion and the radical formed from the reduction of the cation [C 2 mim(+) ] before forming the corresponding electrogenerated carbene. This is confirmed by the voltammetric study of a model imidazolium- 2 -carboxylate compound formed following the carbene pathway. The formation of that stable adduct [C 2 mimH-CO 2 (-) ] blocks CO 2 reduction after a single electron transfer and inhibits CO 2 and imidazolium dimerization reactions. However, the {{electrochemical reduction}} of CO 2 under those conditions provokes the electrochemical cathodic degradation of the imidazolium based RTIL. This important limitation in CO 2 recycling by direct electrochemical reduction is overcome by adding a strong acid, [H(+) ][NTf 2 (-) ], into solution. Then, protons become preferentially adsorbed on the electrode surface by displacing the imidazolium cations and inhibiting their electrochemical reduction.

40|$|International audienceTwo {{treatment}} methodologies such as electro-coagulation coupled electro-flotation (EC–EF) and adsorption {{have been}} adopted to remove doxycycline hyclate (DCH) from the aqueous solution. An electro-coagulation (EC) coupled electro-flotation (EF) system has been designed in a closed reactor with a capacity of 1. 5 L on a laboratory scale. <b>Electro-synthesis</b> of alumina (electro-generated alumina, EGA) using aluminium electrodes with magnesium chloride as an electrolyte was achieved and used for the adsorption experiments. In both the treatment techniques, removal of DCH efficiency {{as a function of}} pH, initial DCH concentration and interfering electrolyte was studied. About 99 % of DCH was removed at the end of 80 minutes in the range of pH 6 – 8 by EC–EF process whereas the adsorption technique achieved about 73 % (73 mg g− 1) of DCH removal in the pH range of 3 – 9 at the equilibrium time of 150 minutes. Current density of 5. 39 mS cm− 2 and EGA dose of 4 g L− 1 was optimized respectively for the EC–EF and adsorption processes. The presence of accompanying electrolyte (NaCl) with DCH solution in the EC–EF process increased the electrical conductivity of 1. 78 mS cm− 1 and could achieve about 90 % of DCH removal in the first 30 minutes. On the other hand, in the adsorption process, the participation of chloride (NaCl) as an interfering ion decreased the DCH removal to about 76 %. Kinetic and isotherm models fitting the DCH removal dynamics in both the techniques have been checked for their validation. Characterization studies which include FTIR, SEM and XRD have also been done to explore the functional groups, surface morphology and crystalline nature of the solid material...|$|E
