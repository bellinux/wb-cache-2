5|$|Towns such as Castle Cary and Frome grew {{around the}} medieval weaving industry. Street {{developed}} as a centre {{for the production of}} woollen slippers and, later, boots and shoes, with C. & J. Clark establishing its headquarters in the town. C Clark's shoes are no longer manufactured there as the work was transferred to lower-wage areas, such as China and Asia. Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village, the first purpose-built <b>factory</b> <b>outlet</b> in the UK. C Clark also had shoe factories, at one time at Bridgwater, Minehead, Westfield and Weston super Mare to provide employment outside the main summer tourist season, but those satellite sites were closed in the late 1980s, before the main site at Street. Dr. Martens shoes were also made in Somerset, by the Northampton-based R. Griggs Group, using redundant skilled shoemakers from C Clark; that work has also been transferred to Asia.|$|E

5|$|From Springville {{north to}} Salt Lake City, US-89 parallels—and for a {{distance}} overlaps—Interstate 15, following the old Arrowhead Trail, once {{the main highway}} from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles, {{through a number of}} downtowns. Numerous state highways connect US-89 to I-15, including SR-77 in Springville, SR-114 in Provo, SR-52 in Orem, SR-180 and SR-145 in American Fork, and SR-73 in Lehi. In Provo, US-89 meets US-189, its only branch, which heads northeast through Provo Canyon to Heber City, connecting to I-80 and bypassing Salt Lake City. North of Lehi, US-89 merges with I-15 (at exit 282), which has been built on or near the old road through a gap in the Traverse Mountains (elevation 4800 feet/1500 m) into the Salt Lake Valley. The routes split in Draper, formerly with a direct interchange north of SR-71, but US-89 traffic must now exit at SR-71 (exit 291), turn east to <b>Factory</b> <b>Outlet</b> Drive, and follow this frontage road to the location of the former split. From here all the way to downtown Salt Lake City, US-89 is marked along State Street, a major northsouth street that ends at the Utah State Capitol. After passing through Sandy, Midvale, Murray, Millcreek Township, and South Salt Lake, State Street enters Salt Lake City at the intersection with SR-201 (2100 South).|$|E

500|$|SR202 was {{extended}} [...] southwest of downtown North Bend {{to a new}} interchange with I-90 in 1978, after it was moved to a freeway bypass of North Bend. The area around the new interchange was annexed {{by the city of}} North Bend prior to the opening of the I-90 bypass, and a <b>factory</b> <b>outlet</b> mall opened at the interchange in 1990. Since the early 2000s, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has built several roundabouts on SR202 in Woodinville, Snoqualmie, Fall City, and North Bend, in an effort to improve the road's safety as traffic increases along the corridor. Another section of SR202 between Redmond and Sammamish was widened in 2008 to accommodate additional traffic and included {{the construction of a new}} flyover ramp at the SR520 interchange. In 2007, WSDOT also studied possible improvements to SR202 in the Sammamish area, recommending the construction of new lanes, traffic signals, guardrails, and other projects. The study's recommended projects would cost an estimated $52.9 million to complete, and were not funded by the state government.|$|E
