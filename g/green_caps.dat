25|$|Baggy <b>green</b> <b>caps</b> can in {{some cases}} be prized as {{valuable}} sporting memorabilia. The cap worn by Sir Donald Bradman during his final season in 1948 sold in 2003 for A$425,000, and the 1953 cap of Keith Miller sold at auction for A$35,000. Even the caps of lesser-known players have fetched figures above A$10,000.|$|E
25|$|For {{the team}} {{classification}}, {{the times of}} the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was {{the team with the}} lowest total time. The riders in the team that lead this classification wore yellow caps. There was also a team points classification. After each stage, the stage rankings of the best three cyclists per team were added, and the team with the least total lead this classification, and were identified by <b>green</b> <b>caps.</b>|$|E
25|$|The baggy green cap was {{originally}} supplied to the player {{as part of}} a kit of equipment, and a new one was routinely issued for each tour, with the year number on it. In fact, a few former Australian players have been known to use the cap for 'non-cricketing' purposes. Bill Lawry used the cap while cleaning his pigeon's nest, while Bill Ponsford was known to wear the cap to protect his hair while painting the fence in front of his house. Ian Chappell never kept any of his baggy <b>green</b> <b>caps.</b> In the early 1990s an unofficial practice emerged amongst test players never to replace a baggy green cap, most notably by Steve Waugh. Although there is no official rule against a player obtaining a replacement cap from Cricket Australia, this almost never occurs, and the increasingly dilapidated state of an aging baggy green cap is a de facto symbol of seniority amongst the players in the team.|$|E

2500|$|To {{honor the}} U.S. military, during Sunday home games, the San Diego Padres {{originally}} sported special camouflage-colored jerseys (with <b>green</b> <b>caps</b> to match); in 2011 the camouflage jerseys were {{changed to a}} brown/tan [...] "desert camo" [...] with a tan cap.

Also, they released a modernized version of the franchise's classic brown jerseys with brown-and-yellow caps (which was originally worn from 1969–1984) to be worn for Friday home games.|$|E
2500|$|The team {{classification}} is {{assessed by}} adding the time of each team's best three riders each day. The competition does not have its own jersey but since 2006 the leading team has worn numbers printed black-on-yellow. Until 1990, the leading team would wear yellow caps. As of 2012, the riders of the leading team wear yellow helmets. [...] During the era of national teams, France and Belgium won 10 times each. From 1973 up to 1988, {{there was also a}} team classification based on points (stage classification); members of the leading team would wear <b>green</b> <b>caps.</b>|$|E

60|$|Some of {{them were}} sipping wine, others were playing cards, others chess, other groups were chatting together, and many were smoking {{cigarettes}} while {{they waited for the}} coming duels. Nearly all of them wore colored caps; there were white caps, <b>green</b> <b>caps,</b> blue caps, red caps, and bright-yellow ones; so, all the five corps were present in strong force. In the windows at the vacant end of the room stood six or eight, narrow-bladed swords with large protecting guards for the hand, and outside was a man at work sharpening others on a grindstone.|$|E
60|$|There were foreign sailors, of all nations, in the streets; {{with red}} shirts, blue shirts, buff shirts, tawny shirts, and shirts of orange colour; with red caps, blue caps, <b>green</b> <b>caps,</b> great beards, and no beards; in Turkish turbans, glazed English hats, and Neapolitan head-dresses. There were the townspeople sitting in {{clusters}} on the pavement, or airing {{themselves on the}} tops of their houses, or walking up and down the closest and least airy of Boulevards; and there were crowds of fierce-looking people of the lower sort, blocking up the way, constantly. In the very heart of all this stir and uproar, was the common madhouse; a low, contracted, miserable building, looking straight upon the street, without the smallest screen or court-yard; where chattering mad-men and mad-women were peeping out, through rusty bars, at the staring faces below, while the sun, darting fiercely aslant into their little cells, seemed to dry up their brains, and worry them, as if they were baited by a pack of dogs.|$|E

60|$|One {{company of}} revellers, {{who had been}} {{particularly}} noticed and applauded, seemed unwilling to conclude their frolic. The entry, as it was called, consisted of thirteen persons, habited in the same manner, having doublets of chamois leather sitting close to their bodies, curiously slashed and laced. They wore <b>green</b> <b>caps</b> with silver tassels, red ribands, and white shoes, had bells hung at their knees and around their ankles, and naked swords in their hands. This gallant party, having exhibited a sword dance before the King, with much clashing of weapons and fantastic interchange of postures, went on gallantly to repeat their exhibition before the door of Simon Glover, where, having made a fresh exhibition of their agility, they caused wine to be served round to their own company and the bystanders, and with a loud shout drank {{to the health of}} the Fair Maid of Perth. This summoned old Simon to the door of his habitation, to acknowledge the courtesy of his countrymen, and in his turn to send the wine around in honour of the Merry Morrice Dancers of Perth.|$|E
6000|$|A rule which forbids social {{intercourse}} {{between members}} of different corps is strict. In the dueling-house, in the parks, on the street, and anywhere and everywhere that the students go, caps of a color group themselves together. If all the tables in a public garden were crowded but one, and that one had two red-cap students at it and ten vacant places, the yellow-caps, the blue-caps, the white caps, and the <b>green</b> <b>caps,</b> seeking seats, would go by that table and not seem to see it, nor seem {{to be aware that}} there was such a table in the grounds. The student by whose courtesy we had been enabled to visit the dueling-place, wore the white cap--Prussian Corps. He introduced us to many white caps, but to none of another color. The corps etiquette extended even to us, who were strangers, and required us to group with the white corps only, and speak only with the white corps, while we were their guests, and keep aloof from the caps of the other colors. Once I wished to examine some of the swords, but an American student said, [...] "It would not be quite polite; these now in the windows all have red hilts or blue; they will bring in some with white hilts presently, and those you can handle freely." [...] When a sword was broken in the first duel, I wanted a piece of it; but its hilt was the wrong color, so it was considered best and politest to await a properer season.|$|E
