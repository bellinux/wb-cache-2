Our technique is to automatically generate a character level grammar from grammars written at token level in the conventional way; the grammars is constructed from modules each of which may have its own whitespace convention.

40|$|The BSI Modula- 2 Working Group has {{suggested}} that Professor Wirth's proposal to discard the <b>export</b> <b>list</b> of a definition module be rejected (Cornelius, 1986). In their report to the Modula- 2 Users Association the Working Group state ‘[WG 084] M 2 WG has agreed to retain the original syntax and semantics, ie objects which are to be exported from a definition module have to be listed in an <b>export</b> <b>list.</b> ’ This paper argues that this suggestion should not be adopted and that the 1984 revision to automatically export all identifiers declared in a definition module should be retained. ANALYSIS Several correspondents to the MODUS Quarterly (November 86) {{have pointed out that}} few if any definition modules export identifiers selectively. This provides a strong prima facie case for assuming that the export clause in a definition module is redundant. There is also a strong case on theoretical and consistency grounds for rejecting selective export. However a more careful analysis of the situation is required to ensure that some unusual but important facility is not being overlooked by deleting it. Accordingly this paper will systematically examine the arguments for and against selective export. In the ensuing discussion the word visible (and its derivatives) will be meant to refer to an item being readable in the text of the definition module, and the term accessible to refer to an ability to refer to the item by imported identifier in a using module. Firstly, we should ask when an identifier must appear in a definition module. Assume that the valid reasons for an identifie...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{the last}} few decades, crude oil (petroleum) has claimed the topmost {{position}} in Nigerian <b>export</b> <b>list,</b> constituting a very {{fundamental change in the}} structure of Nigerian international trade. This paper is intended to model and forecast Nigerian monthly crude oil exportation (in barrels) by applying seasonal autoregressive moving average (SARIMA) into the same data collected between January, 2002 and December, 2011. Result reveals an upward trend of the series which became stationary at 1 st difference, a sharp drop between 2007 and 2009 and autocorrelation function with significant spikes at lag 1, 7 and 12 suggesting the presence of seasonality in the series. Based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Schwartz Bayesian Information Criterion (SBIC) and Hannan-Quinn Information Criterion (HQC), the best model was SARIMA (1, 1, 1) x (0, 1, 1) 12. The diagnosis on such model was confirmed, the error was white noise, presence of no serial correlation and a forecast for current and future values within 24 months period was made which indicates that the crude oil exportation is fairly unstable...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographySummary The {{relationship}} between trade {{and economic growth}} is nuclear to the literature of economic development. Due {{to the importance of}} the external sector to developing countries, most development models have trade regimes and the related system of incentives as central determinants of economic performance. Also, there exists an extensive empirical literature on exports and growth with mixed results. Many studies find evidence of association between exports or exports growth and economic growth although the direction of the causality has not yet been clearly established. Moreover, other studies qualified those results since linkages between exports and economic growth depended on threshold variables. In other words, economic growth tended to be affected by export performance after countries have achieved some minimum level of development. (1); On the other hand, recent empirical studies that have attempted to relate trade orientation and economic performance have been criticized for the misspecification of some variables and the ambiguity of the results, in spite of the sophistication of the empirical models employed (Rodríguez, 1999); In this paper, following the ECLAC tradition, we consider the composition of exports as a crucial determinant of the {{relationship between}} exports and growth although our purpose is basically descriptive(2);. We examine the trade performance of 16 Latin American countries over the past 20 years using a modified Pavit-Guerrieri classification to group trade data according to the technological content of the production functions of individual goods. Simple indicators of revealed comparative advantage of net contribution to trade balance of those groups of products are used to describe changes in trade patterns that followed trade reforms in the most advanced economies in the region. We discuss some of the difficulties in classifying goods according to their production functions when production sharing prevails in international trade. Hence, the presence of a given product in the <b>export</b> <b>list</b> of a country {{does not mean that the}} country master the whole production process of that particular good. Only the labour-intensive segments may be domestically produced in the country. The following section is a brief review of the literature on trade composition and growth. Section II discusses the classification employed in the empirical part and its limitations. Section III describes the indicators used to describe trade patterns in Latin American countries and Section IV presents the results for 16 Latin American countries, with special emphasis on major countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico. Trade reforms seem to have affected trade patterns of those advanced developing countries by strengthening comparative advantages based on natural resources endowments, and also by replacing imported inputs for domestically produced inputs. Section V presents some concluding remarks and areas for further research. **** (1); For a review of the literature, see Greenaway, Morgan and Wright (1999, pp. 41 - 51);.

The problem identified in this study is How to improve the Value Chain operationally to gam competitive advantage. Manufacturing excellence is the strategy in order to achieve it. Apparel industry is a labor-intensive industry and depend on people behavior to impro e productivity which is very much complex in nature. Therct() tT, we should do somethlllg deferent technologically in organizational behavior 111 order to improve alue cha 111 operationally. Currently we adopt division of labor techniques to enhance the producti ity. Fredric Winslow Taylor invented this in 1900. We should adopt behavioral and human relations techniques to further improve productivity of personnel and it is proven by scholars.; supervisor has to play a major role in achieving set goals. So that performance and JOb satisfaction of line supervisors in MAS Holdings (pvt) intimate cluster has higher contnbuuon to the value chain since line. supervisors arc the peopk whu lead tnd guide machine operators. Therefore. their work outcomes arc directly related with orgamntion·s performance. Hence. this research attempts to identify low work outcomes of supervisors and factors that affect the low work outcomes of line supervisors. Oldham and Hackman (1976) I provided a basis for job characteristic aspect of organi/ It Illih. which identified the employee performance and job satisfaction. affected by vanous aspech ofjob characteristics. Relevant literature and job characteristics theory has been discussed in this study to provide the conceptual framework. The study mainly focuses on an examination of job characteristics on performance and job satisfaction of line supervisors. Research study was done focusing only on intimate cluster uf MAS Holdings having export-oriented medium or large-scale f tctories, " hich ha c supervisor based line layout.
