5|$|It also {{provided}} for the Court of First Instance (now known as the General Court) to be based in Luxembourg with the Court of Justice, which remained there. However, this agreement dropped the provision from the 1965 decision, which gave priority to Luxembourg for any new judicial and financial bodies. In response, Luxembourg attached a unilateral declaration stating it did not renounce this article. However they did renounce any claim to {{the seat of the}} judicial Boards of Appeal of the Office for <b>Harmonisation</b> in the Internal Market via the Treaty of Nice.|$|E
5|$|SI {{has become}} the world's most widely used system of measurement, used in both {{everyday}} commerce and science. The change to SI {{had little effect on}} everyday life in countries that used the metric system – the metre, kilogram, litre and second remained unchanged as did {{the way in which they}} were used – most of the changes only affected measurements in the workplace. The CGPM has a role of recommending changes, but no formal role in the enforcement of such changes—another inter-governmental organisation, the International Organization of Legal Metrology (OIML) provides a forum for <b>harmonisation</b> of national standards and legislation in respect of metrology.|$|E

5|$|According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), in 2007, the United Kingdom had 274,000 hives, Italy had 1,091,630, and France 1,283,810. In 2008, the British Beekeepers Association {{reported}} the bee {{population in the}} United Kingdom dropped by around 30% between 2007 and 2008, and an EFSA study revealed that in Italy the mortality rate was 40–50%. However, EFSA officials point out the figures are not very reliable because before the bees started dying, no <b>harmonisation</b> {{was used in the}} way different countries collected statistics on their bee populations. At that time (2008), the reports blamed the high death rate on the varroa mite, two seasons of unusually wet European summers, and some pesticides.|$|E
5|$|Dogs {{are widely}} used in {{biomedical}} research, testing, and education—particularly beagles, because they are gentle and easy to handle, and to allow for comparisons with historical data from beagles (a Reduction technique). They are used as models for human and veterinary diseases in cardiology, endocrinology, and bone and joint studies, research that tends to be highly invasive, according to the Humane Society of the United States. The most common use of dogs is in the safety assessment of new medicines for human or veterinary use as a second species following testing in rodents, {{in accordance with the}} regulations set out in the International Conference on <b>Harmonisation</b> of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use.|$|E
5|$|Mercator {{now turned}} to the modern maps, as author but no longer engraver: the practicalities of {{production}} of maps and globes had been passed to his sons and grandsons. In 1585 he issued a collection of 51 maps covering France, the Low Countries and Germany. Other maps may have followed in good order had not the misfortunes of life intervened: his wife Barbara died in 1586 and his eldest son Arnold died the following year so that only Rumold and the sons of Arnold were left to carry forward his business. In addition, {{the time he had}} available for cartography was reduced by a burst of writing on philosophy and theology: a substantial written work on the <b>Harmonisation</b> of the Gospels as well as commentaries on the epistle of St. Paul and the book of Ezekiel.|$|E

5|$|Switzerland has an {{overwhelmingly}} private sector economy and low tax rates by Western World standards; overall taxation {{is one of}} the smallest of developed countries. Switzerland is a relatively easy place to do business, currently ranking 20th of 189 countries in the Ease of Doing Business Index. The slow growth Switzerland experienced in the 1990s and the early 2000s has brought greater support for economic reforms and <b>harmonisation</b> with the European Union. According to Credit Suisse, only about 37% of residents own their own homes, one of the lowest rates of home ownership in Europe. Housing and food price levels were 171% and 145% of the EU-25 index in 2007, compared to 113% and 104% in Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Special Council of Ministers (equivalent to {{the current}} Council of the European Union) was {{composed}} of representatives of national governments. The Presidency was held by each state {{for a period of}} three months, rotating between them in alphabetical order. One of its key aspects was the <b>harmonisation</b> of the work of the High Authority and that of national governments, which were still responsible for the state's general economic policies. The Council was also required to issue opinions on certain areas of work of the High Authority. Issues relating only to coal and steel were in the exclusive domain of the High Authority, and in these areas the Council (unlike the modern Council) could only act as a scrutiny on the Authority. However, areas outside coal and steel required the consent of the Council.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the ascent}} of the Bourbon monarchy in Spain in 1700, {{each of the}} regions of Spain {{retained}} its own system of measurement. The new Bourbon monarchy tried to centralise control {{and with it the}} system of measurement. There were debates regarding the desirability of retaining the Castilian units of measure or, in the interests of <b>harmonisation,</b> adopting the French system. Although Spain assisted Méchain in his meridian survey, the Government feared the French revolutionary movement and reinforced the Castilian units of measure to counter such movements. By 1849 however, it proved difficult to maintain the old system and in that year the metric system became the legal system of measure in Spain.The Government was urged by the Spanish Royal Academy of Science to approve the creation of a large-scale map of Spain in 1852. The following year Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero was appointed to undertake this task. All the scientific and technical material had to be created. Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero and Saavedra went to Paris to supervise the production by Brunner of a measuring instrument which they had devised and which they later compared with Borda's double-toise N°1 which was the main reference for measuring all geodetic bases in France and whose length was 3.8980732 metres.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Business {{globalisation}} requires {{fast and}} easy exchange of products, services and all related information. This can most easily {{be achieved through}} global standards. Unfortunately the area of standards is rather fragmented itself with national and interna-tional standardisation {{on one side and}} industry driven initiatives on the other side. Even within the international standardisation scene there are competing standards with large overlaps, ambiguous terminology and even contradicting contents. The paper demon-strates the needs for <b>harmonisations</b> of standards using a particular example from inter-national standardisation. Two standards developed in ISO and in IEC are compared and needs for <b>harmonisations</b> are identified. Copyright 2005 IFA...|$|R

25|$|Cantilever {{monoplane}} wings provided ample {{space to}} mount armament— and, being much more rigid {{than the old}} cable-braced wings, they afforded almost as steady a mounting as the fuselage.
