40|$|This report covers tests made on {{models of}} the Mk 25 Torpedo to {{determine}} the effect of gas discharged in the vicinity of a power-driven propeller. It also covers, briefly, tests made on a <b>double</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipe</b> and a single exhaust pipe, both with the vertical rudder set at 10 ° port but without propeller. All of the above was authorized by Dr E. H. Colpitts, Chief of Section 6. 1, NDRC, in a letter dated May 4, 1944. This report is the fourth supplement to the report, Section No. 6. 1 -sr 207 - 1275. Memorandum Reports dated June 22, 1944, July 15, 1944, and September 29, 1944 have been issued giving preliminary results on the tests reported herein. Tests were made on models having a scale ratio of 11 : 21. However, all dimensions and data refer to the prototype unless otherwise noted. Gas discharges are expressed in per cent. These figures have been calculated with reference to the amount of gas discharged from the prototype when running at 40. 5 knots. Allowances for temperature and composition of the exhaust gases have been made by calculating the exit velocity when the torpedo is running at 40. 5 knots and 15 feet submergence, computing the ratio of this velocity to that of the torpedo, and then calculating the amount of air required by the model to obtain this velocity ratio when operating at the equivalent submergence. This criterion requires that a different rate of air flow be taken as the 100...|$|E

5000|$|The {{full duplex}} tubular loop {{frame of the}} AJW Summit were {{specially}} made for AJW by engineers at the Brough Superior workshops in Haydn Road Nottingham, England. [...] AJW motorcycles were very expensive, hand built to customers requirements and well made. The 996cc AJW Summit was capable of 161 km/h. [...] With an unusual aerodynamic 'torpedo' fuel tank, the engine had <b>double</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipes</b> down each side. Enthusiast owners included Brooklands racing champions and record holders Claude Temple and Joe Wright. When AJW began production in 1927 the range included a standard 'sportster' with single-port cylinder heads and a twin-port version but production was slow due to the hand built assembly and delays in obtaining the bought in components, including the frames and engines. Even in its best year, AJW only produced 250 motorcycles. In the great depression of the 1930s the market for luxury motorcycles was very limited and demand for the road going version slumped. The performance of the AJW Summit meant that despite the cost it remained popular with motorcycle racers, so the company stopped building roadsters to concentrate on developing the racing specification. This did not generate enough income, however, and production finally ended in 1931.|$|R

50|$|Crossplane V8 engines have a {{left and}} right bank each {{containing}} 4 cylinders. When the engine is running, pistons are firing according to the engine firing order. If a bank has two consecutive piston firings it will create a high pressure area in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipe,</b> because two <b>exhaust</b> pulses are moving through it close in time. As the two pulses move in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>pipe</b> they should encounter either an X or H pipe. When they encounter the pipe, part of the pulse diverts into the X-H pipe which lowers the total pressure by a small amount. The reason for this decrease in pressure is that the fluid (liquid, air or gas) will travel along a pipe {{and when it comes}} at a crossing the fluid will take {{the path of least resistance}} and some will bleed off, thus lowering the pressure slightly. Without an X-H pipe the flow of exhaust would be jerky or inconsistent, and the engine would not run at its highest efficiency. The <b>double</b> <b>exhaust</b> pulse would cause part of the next exhaust pulse in that bank to not exit that cylinder completely and cause either a detonation (because of a lean air-fuel ratio (AFR)), or a misfire due to a rich AFR, depending on how much of the double pulse was left and what the mixture of that pulse was.|$|R
