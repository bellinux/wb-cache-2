50|$|The {{polysilicon}} <b>dihalides</b> {{are generally}} stable under vacuum {{up to about}} 150-200°C, after which they decompose to perhalosilanes, SinX2n+2 (where n = 1 to 14), and to polysilicon monohalides. However, they are air and moisture sensitive. Polysilicon difluoride is more reactive than the heavier polysilicon <b>dihalides.</b> In stark contrast to its carbon analog, polytetrafluoroethylene, (SiF2)n ignites spontaneously in air, whereas (SiCl2)n inflames in dry air only when heated to 150°C. The halogen atoms in polysilicon <b>dihalides</b> can be substituted with organic groups. For example, (SiCl2)n undergoes substitution by alcohols to give poly(dialkoxysilylene)s.The polysilicon monohalides are all stable to 400°C, but are also water and air sensitive. Polysilicon monofluoride reacts more vigorously than the heavier polysilicon monohalides. For example, (SiF)n decomposes SiF4 above 400°C explosively.|$|R

50|$|Further {{developed}} from previously introduced BINAP-Ru dicarboxylate catalyst, the BINAP-Ru <b>dihalide</b> catalyzes the asymmetric hydrogenation of various α-,β- functionalized ketones.

50|$|The {{stoichiometric}} asymmetric {{reduction of}} ketones {{has long been}} known, but a practical catalytic version was introduced by Noyori et al. While the BINAP-Ru dicarboxylate could only efficiently catalyze the hydrogenation of olefins, the BINAP-Ru <b>dihalide</b> could catalyze both the hydrogenation of olefins and the hydrogenation of functionalized C=O bond.|$|E
50|$|Other <b>dihalides</b> are {{received}} upon heating lead(II) salts {{with the}} halides of other metals; lead <b>dihalides</b> precipitate to give white orthorhombic crystals (diiodide form yellow hexagonal crystals). They {{can also be}} obtained by direct elements reaction at temperature exceeding melting points of <b>dihalides.</b> Their solubility increases with temperature; adding more halides first decreases the solubility, but then increases due to complexation, with the maximum coordination number being 6. The complexation depends on halide ion numbers, atomic number of the alkali metal, the halide of which is added, temperature and solution ionic strength. The tetrachloride is obtained upon dissolving the dioxide in hydrochloric acid; to prevent the exothermic decomposition, it is kept under concentrated sulfuric acid. The tetrabromide may not, and the tetraiodide definitely does not exist. The diastatide has also been prepared.|$|R
25|$|In related reactions, 1,2-dibromocompounds are debrominated by {{zinc dust}} to give alkenes and geminal <b>dihalides</b> can react with strong bases to give carbenes.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>dihalides,</b> the reduction also produces numerous non-stoichiometric samarium halides with a well-defined crystal structure, such as Sm3F7, Sm14F33, Sm27F64, Sm11Br24, Sm5Br11 and Sm6Br13.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the BINAP-Ru <b>dihalide</b> {{catalyst}} {{that requires}} functionalized ketone, the BINAP/diamine-Ru catalyst is effective for the asymmetric reduction of both functionalized and simple ketones, and BINAP/diamine-Ru catalyst can catalyze aromatic, heteroaromatic, and olefinic ketones enantioselectively. Better stereoselectivity is achieved when one substituent {{is larger than}} the other (see Flippin-Lodge angle).|$|E
5000|$|The {{alkylation}} of {{alkali metal}} di- and polysulfides gives disulfides. [...] "Thiokol" [...] polymers arise when sodium polysulfide is treated with an alkyl <b>dihalide.</b> In the converse reaction, carbanionic reagents react with elemental sulfur to afford mixtures of the thioether, disulfide, and higher polysulfides. These reactions are often unselective {{but can be}} optimized for specific applications.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{indication}} that the reaction of SiX4 and Si yields a higher halide SinX2n+2 [...] (n > 1) was in 1871 for the comproportionation reaction of SiCl4 vapor and Si at white heat to give Si2Cl6. This was discovered by the French chemists Louis Joseph Troost (1825 - 191) and Paul Hautefeuille (1836-1902). [...] Since that time, {{it has been shown}} that gaseous silicon <b>dihalide</b> molecules (SiX2) are formed as intermediates in the Si/SiX4 reactions. The silicon <b>dihalide</b> gas molecules can be condensed at low temperatures. [...] For example, if the gaseous SiF2 (difluorosilylene) produced from SiF4 (g) and Si (s) at 1100-1400°C is condensed at temperatures below -80°C and subsequently allowed to warm to room temperature, (SiF2)n is obtained. That reaction was first observed by Donald C. Pease, a DuPont scientist in 1958. [...] The polymerization is believed to occur via paramagnetic di-radical oligomeric intermediates like Si2F4 (•SiF2-F2Si•) and Si3F6 (•SiF2-SiF2-F2Si•), ...|$|E
5|$|Lead <b>dihalides</b> are well-characterized; this {{includes}} the diastatide, and mixed halides, such as PbFCl. The relative insolubility of the latter forms a useful basis for the gravimetric determination of fluorine. The difluoride was the first solid ionically conducting compound to be discovered (in 1834, by Michael Faraday). The other <b>dihalides</b> decompose on exposure to ultraviolet or visible light, especially the diiodide. Many lead pseudohalides are known. Lead(II) forms an extensive variety of halide coordination complexes, such as 2−, 4−, and the n5n− chain anion.|$|R
40|$|We report density-functional calculations, {{carried out}} in a quantum-chemical {{approach}} using localised-Gaussians expansions of the Kohn–Sham orbitals, for metal <b>dihalides</b> trimers (MX 2) 3, where X = Cl, Br, or I and M = Zn, Cd, or Hg. The reliability of the method and the relevance of relativistic terms are assessed by comparisons with previous results on bond lengths in the monomer and dimer of these compounds. In a viewpoint regarding the trimer as a possible structural component of expanded liquid states and of compressed gaseous states, we stress {{the character of the}} local coordination of the metal ion in the ground state as being of a distorted tetrahedral type {{in the case of the}} trimer of the Zn and Cd <b>dihalides</b> and of a twofold type in the Hg <b>dihalides.</b> We also discuss the presence of metastable and unstable structures at higher energies and the quantum-chemical topology of the trimer...|$|R
40|$|Leaving group {{effects on}} the {{electrochemical}} dehalogenation of organic vicinal <b>dihalides</b> have been examined in acetonitrile for the 1, 2 -dihalo- 1, 2 -diphenylethanes and trans- 1, 2 -dihalo-cyclohexanes. Reduction potentials and product distributions support a stepwise addition of two electrons, as previously proposed for the isomers of 1, 2 -dibromo- 1, 2 -diphenylethane. A general reduction mechanism for the vicinal <b>dihalides</b> is proposed. Literature data for the electrochemical reduction of the 5, 6 -dihalodecanes, previously thought to favour a concerted two-electron mechanism, may be {{explained in terms of}} a stepwise process...|$|R
50|$|Even {{though the}} BINAP-Ru <b>dihalide</b> {{catalyst}} could reduce functionalized ketones, the hydrogenation of simple ketones {{has remained a}} challenge. In 1995, Noyori discovered that the RuCl2 (diphosphane)2 (diamine)2 complex can catalyze the hydrogenation of simple ketones. This system also had chemoselectivity on C=O bond over the C=C bond. The diastereoselectivity and the enantioselectivity could be achieved {{at the same time}} using chiral BINAP ligand.|$|E
5000|$|The {{position}} of the equilibrium is influenced by solvent, temperature, {{and the nature of}} the various substituents. It is known that magnesium center in Grignard reagents typically coordinates two molecules of ether such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran (THF). Thus they are more precisely described as having the formula RMgXL2 where L = an ether. In the presence of monoethers, the equilibrium typically favors the alkyl- or arylmagnesium halide. Addition of dioxane to such solutions, however, leads to selective precipitation of <b>dihalide</b> MgX2(dioxane), driving the equilibrium completely to the right side of the equation. [...] The dialkylmagnesium compounds are potent alkylating agents and are popular in the synthesis of organometallic compounds.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{zirconium}} complexes can be formed; however, {{substitution of}} the phosphinimide {{must be done}} through {{the addition of the}} lithium salt, as the R3PNSiMe3 method isn’t effective. Sodium cyclopentadienide can be added to a <b>dihalide</b> phosphinimide to add another Cp or a different Cp ring to the metal and displace a halide. Unlike the titanium complex, the addition of two phosphinimide ligands requires a slightly different route. R3PNH reacted with Zr(NEt2)4, followed by substitution of the remaining NEt2 ligands with Cl through the addition of Me3SiCl yields the bis(phsphinimide) (R3PN)2ZrCl2. Comparable to the titanium complexes, the zirconium complexes can be alkylated or arylated through simple substitution. Once alkylated with Me, reaction with THF and B(C6F5)3 produces the cationic complex R3PNZr(Cp)Cl(THF)+.|$|E
5000|$|Derivatives of Cp2TiCl2 and Cp2ZrCl2 are {{the basis}} of some {{reagents}} in organic synthesis. Upon treatment with aluminoxane, these <b>dihalides</b> give catalysts for olefin polymerization. Such species are called Kaminsky-type catalysts.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dihalides</b> {{used in this}} {{condensation}} polymerization are dichloroalkanes (such as 1,2-dichloroethane, bis-(2-chloroethyl)formal (ClCH2CH2OCH2OCH2CH2Cl), and 1,3-dichloropropane). The polymers are called thiokols. In some cases, polysulfide polymers can be formed by ring-opening polymerization reactions.|$|R
