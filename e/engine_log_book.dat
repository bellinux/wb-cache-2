[...] Small modifications were made to Merlin II and III series engines, allowing an increased (emergency) boost pressure of +12 pounds per square inch (183kPa; 1.85atm). At this power setting these engines were able to produce 1,310 horsepower (977kW) at [...] while running at 3,000 revolutions per minute.

2500|$|Although the Merlin III {{engine of}} Spitfire Is had a power rating of 1,030hp (768kW), {{supplies}} of 100 octane fuel from the United States started reaching Britain in early 1940.

50|$|Subsequently, Brown and Martindale, {{along with}} several {{other members of the}} Aerodynamics Flight and {{assisted}} by a co-operative German pilot, later ferried twelve Ar 234s across the North Sea and on to Farnborough. The venture was not without risk, as before their capture, the Germans had destroyed all the <b>engine</b> <b>log</b> <b>books</b> for the aircraft, leaving Brown and his colleagues no idea of the expected engine hours remaining to the machines. Because of the scarcity of the special high-temperature alloys for use in their construction, the Junkers Jumo 004 engines had a life of only 25 hours - it was thus not known whether the engines were brand new or just about to expire.|$|R
50|$|For general aviation, Hobbs time {{is usually}} {{recorded}} in the pilot's <b>log</b> <b>book,</b> and many fixed-base operators that rent airplanes charge an hourly rate based on Hobbs Time. Tach Time is {{recorded in the}} <b>engine's</b> <b>log</b> <b>books</b> and is used, for example, to determine when the oil should be changed and the time between overhauls. Tach (tachometer) time differs from Hobbs Time {{in that it is}} linked to engine revolutions per minute (RPM). Tach Time records the time at some specific RPM. It is most accurate at cruise RPM, and least accurate while taxiing or stationary with the engine running. At these times, the clock runs slower. Depending on the type of flight, Tach Time can be 10 - 20% less than Hobbs Time. Many organizations such as flying clubs charge by Tach Time so as to differentiate themselves from fixed-base operators by the fact that 10-20% less time recorded makes it 10-20% cheaper to fly (if the hourly rate is the same). In the case where flying clubs use Tach Time, many will charge a dry rate, thus requiring the renter to pay for fuel on top of the hourly Tach Time rate.|$|R

40|$|The {{first part}} of the paper {{presents}} a survey of approaches to maintenance over the last thirty years. A structure of maintenance costs and maintenance concept adjustment and design (MA-CAD) of ship machinery (propulsion engine) is presented here, which provides the required safety level and lowest costs in a life cycle. Improvement and extension of the MA-CAD method can be achieved by analysis of the most common important parts of the propulsion engine that fail, mostly in operation, by designing maintenance intervals and planning spare parts quantity. A diesel-engine propulsion system with gearbox has been chosen for the research. The data on failure and maintenance activities at propulsion engine breakdown in a seaway within a period of thirteen years have been obtained from the <b>engine′s</b> <b>log</b> <b>book.</b> The critical parts that fail mostly in operation are defined by an analysis of breakdowns (registered failure cycles). The critical components include the exhaust valve, injection valve and fuel pump. The most vulnerable part of the propulsion engine is the exhaust valve with the highest failure rate. By application of the method mentioned we obtain a model for the maintenance concept adjustment and design. The suggested model consists of two parts (a new MA-CAD) : the ship and office. The engine machinery behaviour is monitored aboard the ship (failures and maintenance functioning) and the data are sent to the office. On the basis of the data, the office performs the analysis and adjusts (the models) maintenance concept...|$|R
40|$|Objective While many jurisdictions internationally now require learner {{drivers to}} {{complete}} a specified number of hours of supervised driving practice before being able to drive unaccompanied, very few require learner drivers {{to complete a}} <b>log</b> <b>book</b> to record this practice and then present it to the licensing authority. Learner drivers in most Australian jurisdictions must complete a <b>log</b> <b>book</b> that records their practice thereby confirming to the licensing authority that they have met the mandated hours of practice requirement. These <b>log</b> <b>books</b> facilitate the management and enforcement of minimum supervised hours of driving requirements. Method Parents of learner drivers in two Australian states, Queensland and New South Wales, completed an online survey assessing a range of factors, including {{their perceptions of the}} accuracy of their child’s learner <b>log</b> <b>book</b> and the effectiveness of the <b>log</b> <b>book</b> system. Results The study indicates that the large majority of parents believe that their child’s learner <b>log</b> <b>book</b> is accurate. However, they generally report that the <b>log</b> <b>book</b> system is only moderately effective as a system to measure the number of hours of supervised practice a learner driver has completed. Conclusions The {{results of this study suggest}} the presence of a paradox with many parents possibly believing that others are not as diligent in the use of <b>log</b> <b>books</b> as they are or that the system is too open to misuse. Given that many parents report that their child’s <b>log</b> <b>book</b> is accurate, this study has important implications for the development and ongoing monitoring of hours of practice requirements in graduated driver licensing systems...|$|R

40|$|Liquefied {{natural gas}} (LNG) tanker vessel is {{operated}} to carry natural gas at cargo temperature of around - 163 °C. The containment {{system is designed}} to allow heat to escape into the cargo area. Around 0. 15 % of boil-off gas (BOG) is typically present in the cargo volume per day. Thus, the cargoes from the loading terminal are not fully delivered to the client due to the BOG phenomenon. This thesis looks into the utilization of BOG in the boiler. Modem marine boilers installed onboard the LNG carriers are capable of burning 100 % BOG or heavy fuel oil (HFO). It can also use both BOG and HFO in a dual fuel burning operation. A Malaysia International Shipping Corporation (MISC) Berhad vessel which has operated for five voyages and has the same shared route of loading and discharge port {{was identified as a}} sample. The data main source was from the vessel's <b>engine</b> <b>log</b> <b>book.</b> The investigation is conducted by profiling the steam system onboard. On further analysis, the estimated fuel costs and operating characteristics of the facility were determined, focusing on evaluating the fuel to steam conversion efficiency of the boiler. It was found that during the laden voyage, more energy saving of BOG was obtained as compared to HFO in the range of 72. 9 % to 97. 6 % whilst in the ballast voyage, less BOG was obtained in the range of 7 % to 75. 9 %. The percentage energy saved varies whereby the percentage is high when vessel encountered shorter routes or purposely more BOG been utilized through forced boil-off method. The plant efficiency is about the same regardless of the type of fuel burnt in the boiler, whether it is burning combined BOG and HFO, 100 % BOG or 100 % HFO. The only difference is the amount of fuel burnt in the boiler. Hence, it is the owner best interest to decide which fuel to use that provides lesser fuel consumption and less cos...|$|E
