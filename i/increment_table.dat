40|$|The {{chemical}} composition of minerals, temperature and pressure influence geochemical processes between seawater or altered seawater (hydrothermal fluid) and rocks of oceanic crust. These processes suggest an important regulation mechanism of oceanic chemistry and a transportation medium of heavy metals for deposition of sulfides. For examining this five emphasises of investigation by geochemical modelling were fixed: First the reaction between basalt and seawater at temperatures between 0 and 300 °C, pressures of 1 to 86 bars and a rock-seawater-ratio of 0 - 300 were calculated. Secondly cooling of heated seawater from 300 to 0 °C at mentioned pressures was investigated. Thirdly {{the change of}} gold and silver solubility while boiling and after that addition of seawater was considered. Fourthly seawater mixing with vaporenriched hydrothermal fluids were theoretical predicted. Fifthly mixing between brine and seawater and rock alteration, that is happening between brine and rocks of oceanic crust, were modelled. Firstly: Sulfide deposits of Copper, Zink, Iron and Manganese appear with mafic vulcanic rocks, that were deposited in a marine system and are at least altered to metamorphism grade of greenschist facies. The source of hydrothermal fluids that builded these mineral deposits is seawater, that was changed and enriched with metals through reaction with basalt. Alteration products and change of seawater composition while seawater-basalt-interaction at mentioned temperatures and pressures were theoretical predicted by multicomponents equilibria calculation of reaction between seawater and ocean island basalt (OIB) from North Fiji Basin. At mentioned rock-seawater-ratio the mentioned basalt was incrementally titrated in seawater and the equilibrium of bulk system was calculated after each titration <b>increment.</b> <b>Table</b> 1 : Precipitates of seawater-basalt-interaction at a rock-seawater-ratio of 1 / 10 (s. text) Minerals Rock /seawater ratio 1 / 10 300 / 1 Celadonite Saponite-H Magnetite Dolomite Paragonite Daphnite- 14 A Muscovite Beidellite-Ca Heulandite Phlogopite Epidote Chalkopyrite Pyrolusite Talc Minnesotaite Prehnite Albite Tremolite Analcim Hematite Alabandite Saponite-K Quarz Bornite Gibbsite Pyrite Clinozoisite Andradite Tephroite Copper Chlinochlor- 14 A Sphalerite Ferrite-Zn Anhydrite While reaction a series of minerals (s. table 1) precipitated {{and a lot of}} these were subsequently dissolved in fluid. At basalt titration a mineral assemblage precipitates at a rock-seawater-ratio of 300, that hardly differs from the mentioned (s. table 1). At 300 °C the altered fluid is enriched in silica, calcium, sodium, potassium, H 2 S, iron, copper, zinc and manganese, but depleted in MgO and sulfate. This composition change of fluid and mineral assemblage corresponds with laboratory experiments and natural greenstones at seafloor. Secondly: A chemical reaction path model of cooling was calculated for one kilogram fluid at temperatures between 300 and 0 °C and vapor pressure. The resulting fluid composition data of the mentioned basalt-seawater-reaction at 300 °C were used to define the initial fluid composition at the beginning of cooling. At the end of cooling a mineral assemblage was precipitated, that is given in table 2.

40|$|A {{global model}} {{approach}} developed {{on data from}} the experimental aircraft program X- 31 EFM was recently improved during the X- 31 VECTOR program. Both programs are briefly presented, focusing on extremely precise ESTOL landings following a slow, thrust-vectored approach at high angle of attack. High-accuracy navigation and inertial sensor systems enable onboard calculation of the height above runway with sufficient accuracy which is also required to identify ground effect. System identification procedure utilizes a global model to cover the entire flight regime including high-lift configuration during power approach and landing. Analysis of specially designed flight test led to aerodynamic <b>increment</b> <b>tables</b> for supplementary update of the original database. The wind-tunnel and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) predicted ground effect was incorporated into the higly accurate identified global model, which was then used for conventional landings resimulation to support the initial extremely short takeoff and landing (ESTOL) to the ground flight clearance process. Recently an incremental ground effect model was implemented to supplement the original data set. First identification results from conventional and ESTOL landings show some improvements compared to the predictions at very low height above ground...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In burst {{communication}} systems like Body Area Networks (BAN), burst packet should be detected {{prior to the}} demodulation of the signal at the receiver. Meanwhile, different modulation and demodulation algorithms may affect the BER performance of the entire system seriously. To satisfy the conditions that BAN nodes or devices have to be small in size and very low in power consumption, algorithm design of modulation and packet detection are very important. Referring to IEEE 802. 15. 6 BAN standard, theoretical analysis of the modulation and demodulation for pi/ 2 -DBPSK and pi/ 4 -DQPSK is carried out first. The two modulations are realized by using two different two-step looking up table respectively and then united to be one by combining the two phase <b>increment</b> <b>tables.</b> By use of the special structure of pi/ 2 -DBPSK modulated preamble, packet detection algorithm with low complexity is also carefully designed. Simulation results of BER performance are presented at last. In AWGN channel, both modulations achieve good performance, and performance degradation of pi/ 4 -DQPSK happens in multipath channel which may not satisfy the requirements. Adaptive modulation is considered {{to solve this problem}} by choosing different modulation scheme according to channel quality...|$|R

40|$|Study design: {{assessment}} of the accuracy of frameless stereotactic navigation at the second cervical vertebra. Objectives: to assess {{the influence of the}} protocol of preoperative CT-scan and the registration technique on the accuracy of navigation for implanting Magerl-screws. Summary of background data: the use of navigation systems for implanting Magerl-screws could help to decrease the risk of complications and to reduce the required skin incision. Two parameters conceivably affecting the accuracy are the protocol of the preoperative CT-scan and the registration technique. Methods: four cervical spine segments of human cadavers were scanned with two different protocols (3 mm slice thickness/ 2 mm <b>table</b> <b>increment,</b> 1 mm slice thickness/ 1 mm <b>table</b> <b>increment).</b> Registration was performed either based on anatomical landmarks or using a specially designed percutaneous registration device. For the accuracy-check, the pointer tip was exactly placed on markers. The distance between the pointer and the marker displayed on the monitor was referred as an estimate of accuracy. Results: varying the CT-protocol did not significantly affect the accuracy. The mean accuracy was improved from 3 mm after anatomical pair point matching to 1. 5 mm after matching using the percutaneous registration device. Conclusions: the accuracy obtainable seems to be sufficient for implanting Magerl screws by using frameless stereotactic navigation. 3 mm slice thickness and 2 mm <b>table</b> <b>increment</b> is a proper protocol for the preoperative CT-scan.

40|$|The demographer's {{approach}} {{to the study of}} the labor force includesthe calculation of life tables for the active population. Although this tool is extensively used and many countries publish working-life tables, and although they rely on very restrictive assumptions, the technique for constructing such tables has not improved since its development about thirty years ago. This paper reviews the conventional method for the construction of working-life tables and proposes a multi-state approach which does not rely on restrictive assumptions such as the unimodality of the labor-force participation curve. Instead of focusing on changes in stocks, the actual flows of people between active and inactive life are considered. The technique is compared with a similar procedure recently developed by Hoem and Fong. The <b>increment</b> - decrement <b>table</b> of working life serves as a basis for a multistate model for labor-force projection. The proposed model is compared with conventional approaches.

In this study, the cultivar which is having the highest number of plucking points per bush (TRI 2027) records significantly the highest yield indicating the number of plucking points per bush determines the final yield rather man shoot growth.

40|$|Spectral {{responses}} of two glaciated soils, Chalmers {{silty clay loam}} and Fincastle silt loam, formed under prairie grass and forest vegetation, respectively, were measured both in the laboratory under controlled moisture equilibria, and in the field under various moisture and crop residue conditions. An Exotech Model 20 C spectroradiometer was used to obtain spectral data in the laboratory under artificial illumination. Reflectance measurements ranged from 0. 52 -to 2. 32 -µm in 0. 01 µm <b>increments.</b> Asbestos tension <b>tables</b> were used to maintain a 0. 10 -bar moisture equilibrium following saturation of crushed, sieved soil samples. The same spectroradiometer was used outdoors under solar illumination to obtain spectral response from dry and moistened field plots with and without corn residue cover, representing the two different soils. Results indicate that laboratory-measured spectra of moist soil are directly proportional to the spectral response of that same field-measured moist bare soil over the 0. 52 - to 1. 75 -µm wavelength range.

40|$|In CT scanning, {{image quality}} has many {{components}} and {{is influenced by}} many technical parameters. While image quality {{has always been a}} concern for the physics community, clinically acceptable image quality has become even more of an issue as strategies to reduce radiation dose – especially to pediatric patients – become a larger focus. The purpose of this presentation will be to first describe several of the components of CT image quality – noise, slice thickness (Z-axis resolution), low contrast resolution, and high contrast resolution – as well as radiation dose and to describe how each of these may be affected by technical parameter selection. This presentation will pay particular attention to the tradeoffs that exist between different aspects of image quality, especially when the reduction of radiation dose is one of the objectives. The presentation will then explore several mechanisms {{that can be used to}} reduce radiation dose in CT exams and the implications for the diagnostic image quality of the exam. Specifically, the implications of varying the tube current*time product (mAs), pitch or tablespeed (or for axial imaging, the <b>table</b> <b>increment),</b> slice thickness, beam energy (kVp), patient (or phantom) size and dose reduction options (such as varying tube current during exposure) will be described for both radiation dose and diagnostic image quality. These strategies will be described for both single and various multidetector scanners as, unfortunately, the tradeoffs are not uniform across scanners. In addition to these direct effects, this presentation will describe possible indirect effects that both collimation and reconstruction algorithm may have on radiation dose and image quality when compensatory actions are taken to overcome increased noise levels. Finally, this presentation will emphasize that the tradeoffs between radiation dose and image quality are clinical-task dependent; this will be illustrated with examples from selected diagnostic imaging exams...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{propose a}} {{diagnostic}} algorithm for preoperatively predicting {{the need for}} surgical intervention. METHODS: The study included 56 patients (27 men and 29 women) with a final diagnosis of cystic pancreatic lesions. The following materials were used: ultrasonic equipment with 3. 5 and 7 MHz linear, convex and biopsical transducers. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) investigations were performed using a 16 -slice scanner. Images were obtained following the oral administration of 200 mL water and 100 mL intravenous iopamidol (300 mg/mL) administered by pump injector {{at a rate of}} 3 mL/s (40 and 60 s post-injection, respectively) using 0. 5 mm detectors, reconstructed at 1 mm (pancreatic phase) or 2 mm (portal venous phase) <b>increments.</b> The <b>table</b> feed was 10 mm per rotation. Images were acquired in the pancreatic and portal venous phases of contrast enhancement. The &#x 201 C;Chiba&#x 201 D; needles 18, 20, 22, 23 G and an automatic aspiration system were used in conjunction with the following methods of guiding the interventional procedures: (1) &#x 201 C;free-hand&#x 201 D; biopsy and puncture method under ultrasound (US) or computed tomography (CT) control; (2) guiding method using biopsical transducer. RESULTS: All 56 patients in this study underwent at least two cuts imaging survey methods, such as US, CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The most common preoperative diagnostic examination was US scan - 56 patients (100 %). MDCT studies were conducted in 49 (87. 50 %) and MRI in 13 (23. 21 %). More than half of patients surveyed (37) underwent some type of interventional procedure: 25 -fine-needle aspiration and 29 -fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), as part of the examination. Thirty-four patients of all 56 patients underwent surgery because of histological evidence of malignancy after the FNAB for cystic lesions of the pancreas. Distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was the most common operative approach in 13 patients, followed by Whipple resection in 11 and distal pancreatectomy without splenectomy in 7. Three patients were treated with total pancreatectomy due to the presence of a multifocal mucinous neoplasm. Comparing the diagnostic results of US examination with those of MDCT examination and histological verification true positive results were found in 31 patients, true negative in 11 patients, false positive in 5 and false negative in 9 patients. Accordingly we estimated the power of the diagnostic imaging methods for cystic lesions of the pancreas. A specificity of 68. 75 %, sensitivity of 79. 48 %, accuracy of 75. 00 %, positive predictive value of 86. 11 % and negative predictive value of 55 % were obtained. The power increased after applying invasive procedures with immunohistochemical analysis of CEA and P- 53 (Fig. 4). In 15 patients with cytological feature of malignant tumour cells, the tumour markers were positive. In our opinion the higher the percentage of reacting cells the higher the percent of malignancy. In patients with clear symptoms and/or clear imaging features of malignant or premalignant cystic neoplasm, the need for surgery was confirmed by histological verification in 34 (60. 71 %) of cases. CONCLUSION: By using the proposed algorithm, cystic mucinous tumors of the pancreas were detected and proper operative interventions would have been rendered with fewer diagnostic examinations...|$|R
40|$|Saylam et al. (2007) {{are to be}} congratulated {{for their}} recent article on the {{relationship}} of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) with the cranial nerves, with particular reference to the microsurgery of this region. However, we would like to bring some additional observations {{to the attention of the}} authors. The study of the vessels of the brain base is one of our fields of research (De Caro et al., 1990, 1991, 1995, 1996, 1998, 2000; Porzionato et al., 2004; Macchi et al., 2005; Parenti et al., 2005). We studied the PICA on 40 autoptic brains (Macchi et al., 2004), and we were able to analyze the origin and the whole course of 80 PICAs, with reference to the five segments described by Lister et al. (1982), which were recognizable on both sides. It is a pity that Saylam et al. (2007) analyzed 40 PICAs of 25 cadavers, limiting their study to only two segments, i. e., the anteromedullary and the lateromedullary. In their results, the relationships of the PICA with the cranial nerves are listed following the number of cranial nerve [‘‘(1) course of the LM segment of the PICA and its relationship to the facial and vestibular nerves; (2) relationship between the origin of the PICA and its course relative to the rootlets of the glossopharyngeal, vagus, and accessory nerves; (3) relationship between the rootlets of the hypoglossal nerve and the PICA], rather than to the topographical course of the PICA, which would be clinically useful (origin and relationship of the PICA and hypoglossal rootlets; lateromedullary segment of the PICA; relationship between the PICA and the glossopharyngeal, vagus, and accessory nerves; tonsillomedullary and telovelotonsillary segments’ bifurcation). The former way of presentation has led the authors to a misinterpretation of the results of Macchi et al. (2004). Indeed, Saylam et al. (2007) discuss that the relationship of the PICA with the vagus nerve ‘‘is somewhat variable’’ with respect to the patterns of the course proposed by Macchi et al. (2004), who found that if the artery originates at a caudal level, it tends to pass below the vagus nerve and that if it originates from the basilar artery (BA), it passes above that nerve. In reality, the caudal level of the origin of the PICA corresponds to the lateromedullary segment of the vertebral artery (VA), and the data reported in Table 2 of the paper by Saylam et al. (2007) makes it clear that when the PICA originates from the lateromedullary segment of the VA, it is located in all the cases (10 / 10) below the vagus nerve. Thus, the findings of Saylam et al. (2007), adding 10 further new cases, confirm our hypothesis (Macchi et al., 2004). Moreover, Saylam et al. (2007) report that they found only one PICA originating from the BA and passing between the IX and X cranial nerves, as shown in Figure 2; however, Figure 7 shows one more PICA originating from the BA, and passing above the IX cranial nerves. On the other hand, they did not consider it relevant to provide figures of PICAs originating from the BA and passing below the X cranial nerves. Clinical-anatomic research is using computed tomography angiography (CTA) to map the vasculature in anatomical districts’ study (Tregaskiss et al., 2007). Huynh-Le et al. (2004) reported that threedimensional CTA demonstrates the surgical anatomy of VA-PICA aneurysms in detail, and it is very useful in selecting the optimal surgical approach. Our team is evaluating the course of the PICA in vivo by computed tomography. From our anatomoradiological database (Section of Radiology, Euganea Medica, Italy) six CTAs of the brain vessels (three males, three females; mean age, 54. 6 years) were selected. The subjects underwent radiological examination for atherosclerotic pathology of the vessels of the circle of Willis. The CT images were obtained with a 16 - slice multidetector CT scanner (Lightspeed 16; GE Medical System, Milwaukee, WI) with the parameters (group 1; rotation time, 0. 7 sec; thickness, 2. 5 mm; <b>table</b> <b>increment,</b> 27 / 50; field of view, large; kV 140; 380 mA) acquired during the injection of the contrast medium (concentration of 350 mg I/ml, Omnipaque, GE Healthcare, distributed by Amersham Health, Princeton, NJ). A timing-bolus technique was applied to determine the delay time of scanning with a preinjection of 20 ml of contrast media at a flow rateof 5 ml/sec. Subsequently, 90 – 100 ml were injected intravenously, at 5 ml/sec, followed by a 50 -ml saline chaser bolus, via a catheter placed in the cubital vein, and imaging acquisition was obtained in the angiographic phase. The acquired data were then reconstructed with 0. 6 -mm slice thickness with an overlapping of 0. 3 mm. The data were transferred to an Aquarius workstation (TeraRecon TM, San Mateo, CA), and three-dimensional reconstructions (volume rendering technique, maximum intensity projection, and multiplanar reconstructions) were obtained. We were able to visualize the PICA in 10 / 12 PICAs in CT images (Fig. 1), showing the site of origin and the course of the lateromedullary segment. Our data confirm the role of CTA as advancing imaging technologies in basic anatomical research to study the vasculature both in cadaveric research and clinical studies in preoperative planning (Tregaskiss et al., 2007; Rozen et al., 2007) ...|$|R
