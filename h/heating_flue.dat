50|$|A fuel-heated boiler {{must provide}} air to oxidize its fuel. Early boilers {{provided}} this stream of air, or draught, through the natural action of convection in a chimney {{connected to the}} exhaust of the combustion chamber. Since the <b>heated</b> <b>flue</b> gas is less dense than the ambient air surrounding the boiler, the flue gas rises in the chimney, pulling denser, fresh air into the combustion chamber.|$|R
