5|$|If {{a runner}} {{advances}} because the defense {{does nothing to}} try to stop the advance, the scorer may rule that the advance was due to defensive indifference and no stolen base is credited. However, a throw is not required for a stolen base. If a fielder begins to visibly make an attempt to prevent an advance but then elects not to throw, the advance <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>due</b> to defensive indifference.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pasteur {{demonstrated}} in 1859 {{that the growth}} of microorganisms causes the fermentation process, and that this growth <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>due</b> to spontaneous generation. (Yeasts and moulds, commonly associated with fermentation, are not bacteria, but rather fungi.) Along with his contemporary Robert Koch, Pasteur was an early advocate of the germ theory of disease.|$|E
5|$|Low-level jet streams. When a nocturnal {{low-level}} jet forms overnight {{above the}} Earth's surface {{ahead of a}} cold front, significant low level vertical wind shear can develop near the lower portion of the low level jet. This {{is also known as}} nonconvective wind shear since it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>due</b> to nearby thunderstorms.|$|E

50|$|Hahnel and Sheeran {{emphasize}} that these failures <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>due</b> to behavioral issues or irrationality (although these are quite prevalent (ultimatum game, cognitive biases)), <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>due</b> to transaction costs (although these are also quite prevalent), and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>due</b> to absorbing states and inability to pay. Rather, they {{are due to}} fundamental theoretical requirements of Coase's theorem (necessary conditions) that are typically grossly misunderstood, and that when not present systematically eliminate the ability of Coaseian approaches to obtain efficient outcomes—locking in inefficient ones. Hahnel and Sheeran conclude that {{it is highly unlikely}} that conditions required for an efficient Coaseian solution will exist in any real-world economic situations.|$|R
5|$|In {{models of}} the {{expanding}} universe, the farther galaxies are from each other, the faster they drift apart. This receding <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>due</b> to motion through space, but rather {{to the expansion of}} space itself. For example, galaxies far away from Earth appear to be moving away from the Earth with a speed proportional to their distances. Beyond a boundary called the Hubble sphere, the rate at which their distance from Earth increases becomes greater than the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|The Darkside, which derives {{its name}} {{from a lack of}} street lights when {{students}} first began to move to the area, is bounded by Stewart Street to the south, Brown Street to the west, Woodland Cemetery to the east and Wyoming Street to the north. Traditionally, the Darkside has served as housing for juniors. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>due</b> to any university policy, but rather the preference of seniors, who select houses first in the student housing lottery due to their larger number of credit hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{has been}} seen as central to the pathology of schizophrenia, both in the neural and physiological effects. It has been generally accepted that there is an abnormal synaptic connectivity underlying schizophrenia. Several lines of evidence implicate changes in the synaptic organization and connectivity, in and from the hippocampus Many studies have found dysfunction in the synaptic circuitry within the hippocampus and its activity on the prefrontal cortex. The glutamatergic pathways have been seen to be largely affected. The subfield CA1 is seen to be the least involved of the other subfields, and CA4 and the subiculum have been reported elsewhere as being the most implicated areas. The review concluded that the pathology could be due to genetics, faulty neurodevelopment or abnormal neural plasticity. It was further concluded that schizophrenia <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>due</b> to any known neurodegenerative disorder.|$|E

5|$|The {{next most}} common use is {{as an aid}} for smoking cessation. Bupropion reduces the {{severity}} of nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Bupropion is helpful for smoking cessation in smokers with no history of depression; thus, the effectiveness of bupropion <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>due</b> to its antidepressant effect. A typical bupropion treatment course lasts up to twelve weeks, with people halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course. Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully. The effectiveness of bupropion is comparable to nicotine replacement therapy, but less effective than varenicline.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} {{season for the}} Central American squirrel monkey is in September. All females come into estrus at virtually the same time. A month or two before the {{breeding season}} begins, males become larger. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>due</b> to extra muscle, but to altered water balance within the male's body. This is caused by conversion of the male hormone testosterone into estrogen; thus the more testosterone a male produces, the more he grows {{in advance of the}} breeding season. Since males within a group have not been observed fighting over access to females during breeding season, nor attempting to force females to copulate with them, it is believed that female choice determines which males get to breed with females. Females tend to prefer the males that expand the most in advance of breeding season. This may be because the most enlarged males are generally the oldest and the most effective at detecting predators, or it may be a case of runaway intersexual selection.|$|E
