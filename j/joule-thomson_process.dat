We show applications of the method to reactive distillation and plasmas, and reactions in carbon slits and carbon nanotubes.

[...] In 1895, William Hampson in England and Carl von Linde in Germany independently developed and patented the Hampson-Linde cycle to liquefy air using the <b>Joule-Thomson</b> expansion <b>process</b> and regenerative cooling.

2500|$|In {{thermodynamics}} so-called [...] "specific" [...] quantities are quantities {{per unit}} mass (kg) and are denoted by lower-case characters. So h, u, and v are the specific enthalpy, specific internal energy, and specific volume (volume per unit mass, or reciprocal density), respectively. In a <b>Joule–Thomson</b> <b>process</b> the specific enthalpy h remains constant. To prove this, {{the first step}} is to compute the net work done when a mass m of the gas moves through the plug. This amount of gas has a volume of V1 = m v1 in the region at pressure P1 (region 1) and a volume V2 = m v2 when in the region at pressure P2 (region 2).

Except for the rotational particle separator, the equipment needed for the CRS process can be purchased as proven technology. The RPS has been demonstrated in an atmospheric test rig with water and air as working fluids (Willems et al. 2010 b). The test setup approximately models a 24 m 3 /s (80 MMscf/d) equivalent installation on a natural gas well. A prototype that can operate under pressure is constructed in preparation for a field test.|$|R
40|$|A closed-cycle 10 K {{sorption}} cryocooler {{is being}} fabricated for microgravity testing during a future space shuttle mission. A {{critical component of}} this cryogenic refrigerator is the metal hydride sorbent bed assembly (SBA). The SBA uses hydrides which absorb hydrogen gas at low pressure, (i. e., about 0. 25 MPa from liquid hydrogen at 25 K and below 0. 2 kPa from solid hydrogen near 10 K) and subsequently delivers hydrogen at nearly 10 MPa to a storage reservoir to repeat the <b>Joule-Thomson</b> (J-T) expansion <b>process.</b> The SBA includes three independent hydride beds where two contain LaNi(sub 4. 8) Sn(sub 0. 2) alloy and the third ZrNi. Detailed descriptions will be given for the three beds, which have specialized design features to enhance performance at each step of operation. In particular, two beds must rapidly absorb hydrogen {{in order for the}} J-T cold stage to reach 10 K within two minutes from a 65 K holding temperature. Performance characterization results will be compared to model analyses of the SBA...|$|R
40|$|Passive cooling {{has shown}} to be a very {{dependable}} cryogenic cooling method for space missions. Several missions employ passive radiators to cool down their delicate sensor systems for many years, without consuming power, without exporting vibrations or producing electromagnetic interference. So for a number of applications, passive cooling is a good choice. At lower temperatures, the passive coolers run into limitations that prohibit accommodation on a spacecraft. The approach to this issue has been to find a technology able to supplement passive cooling for lower temperatures, which maintains as much as possible of the advantages of passive coolers. Sorption cooling employs a closed cycle <b>Joule–Thomson</b> expansion <b>process</b> to achieve the cooling effect. Sorption cells perform the compression phase in this cycle. At a low temperature and pressure, these cells adsorb the working fluid. At a higher temperature they desorb the fluid and thus produce a high-pressure flow to the expander in the cold stage. The sorption process selected for this application is of the physical type, which is completely reversible. It does not suffer from degradation {{as is the case with}} chemical sorption of, e. g., hydrogen in metal hydrides. Sorption coolers include no moving parts except for some check valves, they export neither mechanical vibrations nor electromagnetic interference, and are potentially very dependable due to their simplicity. The required cooling temperature determines the type of working fluid to be applied. Sorption coolers can be used in conjunction with passive cooling for heat rejection at different levels. This paper starts with a brief discussion on applications of passive coolers in different types of orbits and on the limitations of passive cooling for lower cooling temperatures. Next, the working principle of sorption cooling is summarized. The DARWIN mission is chosen as an example application of sorption and passive cooling and special attention is paid to the reduction of the radiator area needed by the sorption cooler. The application field of this type of sorption cooling in space missions is currently being expanded by examining the performance of alternative working fluids, suitable for different cooling temperatures...|$|R
