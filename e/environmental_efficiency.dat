The biggest bus operators are Nobina Finland, Veolia Transport Finland and Helsingin Bussiliikenne (HelB). These companies run a majority of the contract services.

In the production process, CO 2 is considered as undesirable output that always risesas long as desirable output is produced. Indonesia, as {{the one of the}} biggest emitter of CO 2 emission, has been committing in reducing emission up to 26 % for 2020. Using panel data, stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) has been used to evaluate the <b>environmental</b> technical <b>efficiency</b> of manufacturing industry in Java on 2006 - 2009.

40|$|This paper investigates how {{current and}} future generations are {{affected}} by commitment-based Nash equilibrium environmental strategies when the <b>environmental</b> absorption <b>efficiency</b> is susceptible to switch from a pollution sink to a source. We formulate a two-player differential game model of transboundary pollution that includes the <b>environmental</b> absorption <b>efficiency</b> as a state variable that can be enhanced thanks to restoration efforts. Based on a logarithmic specification for the instantaneous revenue function, we characterize the cooperative solution and the commitment-based Nash equilibrium strategy, and examine their differences in terms of steady state and transient behavior. We notably show that a commitment-based Nash equilibrium strategy {{makes it possible to}} prevent a definitive switching of the <b>environmental</b> absorption <b>efficiency</b> from a pollution sink to a source but imposes greater economic sacrifices on current generations than on future generations. In comparison, the cooperative solution imposes greater sacrifices on current generations in terms of revenues but it imposes lower environmental costs on both {{current and future}} generations than commitment-based Nash equilibrium strategy...|$|R

As industry is the main contributor to environmental deterioration, the development mode of industry has attracted attention {{from the government and}} the public. In this paper, we have assumed that the industry is permitted a fixed total amount of pollution in order to avoid excessive pollution. If one province shows increased pollution, other provinces are required to reduce pollution by the same amount to maintain the total level of pollution. However, so far, few studies have considered such competition over outputs. This paper presents a new data envelopment analysis approach, which considers both the fixed and the variant sum desirable outputs in the performance improvement of a decision making unit, to evaluate the <b>environmental</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of China's industry from 2007 to 2011. The analysis results demonstrate that some economically developed provinces have better performance than less developed provinces; in particular, all efficient provinces are the developed ones. The Chinese government should focus on the increasing differences in <b>environmental</b> <b>efficiencies</b> among regions and take measures to address them. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
