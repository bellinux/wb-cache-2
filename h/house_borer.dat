Adult Anobium punctatum measure 2.7 - 4.5 mm in length. They have brown ellipsodial bodies with a prothorax resembling a monk's cowl [...]|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} our {{experiment}} was to establish how exposure to a constant magnetic field of 98 mT affects behavior in terms of viability and larval mass of the old <b>house</b> <b>borer</b> (Hylotrupes bajulus L.). It is demonstrated that larvae exposed to this magnetic field show statistically significant higher viability, {{as well as a}} tendency of mass increase in comparison with the control group. These results {{can be attributed to the}} modulatory effect of the employed external magnetic field on metabolism and neurohumoral regulation in the insects...|$|E
50|$|The last Lord of Castle Wertenstein died in 1745. In {{the years}} that {{followed}} (1748 to 1754), his offspring sold the lordship to Tholey Abbey, which thus acquired the tithing rights. Moreover, the Abbey exercised low jurisdiction, while high jurisdiction, as had been so before, lay with the Duke of Lorraine. Appeals, therefore, had to be heard in Lorraine’s capital, Nancy. In 1766, the last Duke of Lorraine died, and France came into the Duke’s inheritance. Only a few years later, though, the Duke of Zweibrücken brokered a deal with France whereby Zweibrücken traded certain places in Alsace for the villages of Freisen, Heimbach, Weiersbach, Bleiderdingen and Leitzweiler. The Duke thereby managed to fill some of the territorial gaps in his holdings in 1783.In November 1792, three years after the French Revolution, French Revolutionary troops descended on the Leitzweiler area. The French burnt Leitzweiler down, but this might have been a case of “mistaken identity”. It seems that the French soldiers were to have burnt Eitzweiler, another village a few kilometres away, today a constituent community of Freisen in the Saarland. To offset Leitzweiler’s loss, Eitzweiler was ordered to deliver to Leitzweiler oakwood so that the mistakenly burnt village could rise from its ashes. This, however, was not what Leitzweiler got. Instead, the wood delivered to the village was ash, which was not as popular as oak, for <b>house</b> <b>borers</b> found it quite appetizing. With the Treaty of Campo Formio in October 1797, the Rhine’s left bank was ceded to France. All lordly holdings were seized by the state and French law was imposed. Leitzweiler was part of the Department of Sarre and in the canton of Birkenfeld.|$|R
40|$|There are {{two issues}} {{at the core of}} {{invasive}} species risk management: on the one hand, decision-makers struggle to balance environmental goals against other often competing societal goals such as economic benefits and social welfare; on the other hand, uncertainty often prevails in understanding the invasion process and in communicating invasion risks to the stakeholders. In this paper, we describe how an integrated Deliberative Multi-Criteria Evaluation (DMCE) and fuzzy set approach can tackle these two issues in the analysis of alternative risk management strategies, using the example of European <b>House</b> <b>Borer</b> (EHB, Hylotrupes bajulus Linnaeus). DMCE offers a platform for stakeholders to interact and to make a trade-off decision between multiple goals based on social learning and deliberation. The fuzzy set approach, applied within a DMCE framework, explicitly incorporates the inherent uncertainty in estimating potential EHB impacts and in evaluating participants' subjective preferences. This integrated method, therefore, provides a promising approach for tackling the dual challenges of competing goals and uncertainty in the evaluation of invasive species risk management options.

40|$|The European <b>House</b> <b>Borer</b> (EHB) is a timber pest which attacks dead timber. This pest {{can cause}} large scale damage to wooden {{structures}} {{and has already}} spread throughout {{many parts of the}} world. The larvae usually remains undetected for many years while it busily inflicts irrevocable and substantial harm to the timber. Since the pest was first discovered in Western Australia in 2004 the Government has endeavoured to extinguish its existence. In this research, an electronic sensor has been developed in order to detect the presence of EHB larvae in timber. Only an accurate detection can allow for selective treatment, which is required in order to eliminate the pest. In the past no reliable detection methods were available. However, with the developed acoustic sensing device, non-destructive and reliable detection of EHB is now possible. The developed handheld device is capable of analysing the acoustic emissions from a timber structure which allows for determining whether or not EHB is present in its vicinity. Depending on the level of the infestation, the detection can take as little as a few seconds. The tests, which have been carried out on infested timber beams in a secured laboratory, show a reliable detection of the larvae over a distance of several metres. The research discusses the challenges encountered throughout the development of the acoustic sensor and the limitations of the technology. Also presented are other potential applications for the device and areas which require further research in order to improve the efficiency of the sensor...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Pest {{status of}} {{household}} and structural pests is {{based primarily on}} their persistence in the urban environment. Persistence of pest populations is determined by availability of reservoir habitats that harbor large and stable populations, which supply individuals to maintain small, local infestations. Success of pest species in the urban environment is dependent on a network of infestations and reservoir populations. Decline of pest species is linked to reduction or elimination of reservoir populations. The role of reservoir habitats and populations in the persistence of German and American cockroaches, old <b>house</b> <b>borer,</b> and American and European dust mites is discussed. Blattella germanica survives as a pest only indoors in local infestations and {{a limited number of}} urban reservoir populations. The importance of these popula-tions is evident in the decline in abundance and reduced pest status of this cockroach. Periplaneta americana lives in local infestations outdoors and indoors, and is supported by reservoir populations in urban sewers. There is limited potential for reducing its reservoir habitats, and it is likely to maintain its pest status. A cerambycid Hylotrupes bajulus occurs only in local infestations of structural softwoods in urban and rural buildings, and in reservoir populations in lumber storage sites. Effective control of structural infestations and improvements in lumber storage have removed the key reservoirs needed for persistence of this pest. Dermatophagoides spp. dust mites depend on small, local populations to persist in the living space. Long-term pest status of these mites is expected because of the relative ineffectiveness of cleaning to remove enough of a pest population to achieve reduction, and the ease in which mites are carried to new sites or existing infestations.

40|$|European <b>House</b> <b>Borer</b> (EHB) Hylotrupes bajulus Linnaeus, is {{considered}} a serious invasive threat {{because it is a}} destructive pest of seasoned coniferous timber including pine, fir and spruce. If allowed to become established it can cause major structural damage to buildings. The pest is able to live in a variety of climatic conditions however it prefers temperate habitats. Methyl bromide is widely used for quarantine treatment but it is being phased out due to its listing as an ozone depleting substance. Furthermore, complete control of EHB with methyl bromide in timber at low temperatures and high moisture content is difficult. Currently, there are no known chemical or biological controls for EHB larvae in timber and wood packaging and the obvious way to reduce the quarantine threat posed by EHB is to develop reliable and effective means to disinfest wooden materials at the source. There is an urgent requirement for an alternative effective fumigant for the control of EHB larva in timber and wood. Ethanedinitrile (EDN) is a new fumigant (patented under the chemical name “cyanogen”) and it is known to be highly toxic to insect pests of timber and is fast acting. It is believed to have particular potential as a quarantine treatment for timber. EHB larvae of differing lengths were found to have varying tolerance to both EDN and methyl bromide with the larger EHB found to be more tolerant. In all experimental fumigations with larvae of a range of lengths and at varying exposure times (6 and 24 hours), EDN showed more toxicity than methyl bromide. EDN achieved 100 % mortality at 40 mg/L, 25 °C and 70 % r. h. for 24 hours of exposure with timber blocks artificially infested with EHB. However, under the same experimental conditions, methyl bromide at 48 mg/L only achieved a mortality range of 97. 3 - 100 %...|$|E
40|$|The Mediterranean forest {{regions of}} Australia {{predominantly}} comprise native mallee scrub, eucalypt woodlands, exotic Pinus plantations, and commercial eucalypt plantations. Native forests have, so far, remained largely free of invasive exotic insects. The exotic pines, however, have five well-established and significant invasive pest insects: the bark beetles Ips grandicollis, Hylastes ater, and Hylurgus ligniperda (Coleoptera: Curculiondae), Monterey pine aphid, Essigella californica (Hemiptera: Aphididae), and Sirex woodwasp, Sirex noctilio (Hymenoptera: Siricidae), {{with the latter}} not yet present in Western Australia (WA). The exotic giant pine scale, Marchalina hellenica (Hemiptera: Margarodidae), was recently detected on pines in Adelaide and Melbourne and is under an eradication program. Many of the established pest species have had classical biological control programs implemented. European <b>house</b> <b>borer,</b> Hylotrupes bajulus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), a pest of untreated softwood, is established in areas around Perth, WA, and {{has been found in}} dead and live trees, as well as untreated timber. African black beetle, Heteronychus arator (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) is a major exotic agricultural and forestry pest in wetter parts of the Mediterranean forest regions in WA, where it was first recorded in 1938. Several other exotic polyphagous horticultural pests are occasionally associated with eucalypts. Australia is the origin of major insect pests on Eucalyptus species grown in Mediterranean regions across the globe. However, populations of these insects are generally effectively controlled by native species of natural enemies in Australia. At least five species endemic to eastern Australia, Gonipterus platensis and G. sp. nov. 2, (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Paropsisterna m-fuscum (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), Phylacteophaga froggatti (Hymenoptera: Pergidae) and Cardiapsina fiscella (Hempitera: Psyllidae), have been introduced to Mediterranean regions of WA, where they initially caused extensive and severe damage to plantations of introduced eucalypt species (predominantly E. globulus) in the region. However, the level and extent of damage gradually decreased, and it has been hypothesised that improved control by endemic natural enemies has occurred...|$|E
30|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, wood-based {{composites}} have gained broad acceptance for constructional applications, and due to the depletion of the supply of high-quality wood, wood-based composites have been increasingly produced and utilized to replace solid wood. However, since their major component is solid wood, these composites require protection from decay fungi and wood-destroying insects if used in outdoor applications. It {{has been reported that}} these composites are experiencing failure due to the abovementioned biological agents [1 – 4]. Therefore, the durability of wood-based composites remains an important factor for increasing the service life of these composites in challenging environments. Amongst the various pre-treatment or post-treatment techniques, the in-line (or in-process) treatment, which incorporates the biocide during the manufacturing process, has become the method of choice for particleboard and other composites with relatively small particle or fiber size [5, 6]. Compared to the other methods, in-line treatment provides several advantages, including full protection of the composite cross-section and the ability to cut or drill the composite at any time without applying remedial treatments. In recent years, several biocides such as zinc borate, boric acid and permethrin have been utilized for the in-process treatment of particleboards and medium-density fiberboards (MDFs) [7 – 10]. Sodium fluoride (NaF) has been used effectively for many years in Europe and the USA as a registered wood preservative chemical for solid wood applications (e.g., railroad ties and utility poles) against wood decaying fungi and subterranean termites. In Australia and USA fluoride rods (e.g., flurods, 98 % sodium fluoride, Osmose Utilities Services, Inc.) were used as internal remedial treatments in utility poles [11, 12]. It is not very soluble in water but has poor resistance to leaching. The first multi-salt preservative chemical was patented by Dr. Wolman in Germany and consisted of sodium fluoride (85 %), dinitrophenol (10 %) and sodium dichromate (5 %) known as Triolith [13, 14]. Because their high efficacy against decay fungi, fluorides became an important wood preservatives in initial and remedial treatments due to their ability to diffuse via free water through refractory wood species [15]. Bifluorides were also used as wood preservatives in Germany against decay fungi and some insect species especially European <b>House</b> <b>Borer,</b> Hylotrupes bajulus (L.). As the previous literature mostly deals with biological performance of NaF or other fluoride salt treated solid wood, the current study focuses on NaF treatment of wood-based composites via in-line treatment. Additionally, NaF is an incombustible, colorless, odorless, non-corrosive crystalline solid or powder with very high melting (993  °C) and boiling (1704  °C) temperatures, which makes it suitable for high-temperature manufacturing processes such as hot pressing or extrusion. As a medication, it is primarily used to prevent tooth decay and osteoporosis in humans [16]. Thus, as a biocide, it might be considered as having a minimal environmental impact with low mammalian toxicity when compared to others. However, the efficacy of NaF against wood decay fungi and termites in wood-based composite production is poorly documented and requires further investigation. The objectives of this paper were to evaluate the feasibility of sodium fluoride (NaF) as a biocide for in-line treatment during the manufacture of particleboard and to investigate its efficacy, leachability and effects on physical and mechanical properties.|$|E
