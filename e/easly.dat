But patents were not <b>easly</b> granted in response to these applications (only 3 % of them led to valid patent). The high post-grant opposition rate (41 %) for granted patents indicated that competitors tightly monitored each other’s patents. The evidence, as augmented with clinical case studies, supports the notion that, for an invention to pass the inventive step requirement for obtaining a European patent, it should have technical features for solving a sufficiently challenging technical problem.

The keys to a successful procedure are: the complete devascularization of the uterus before any other surgical procedure is performed on the uterus, {{the use of a}} monopolar current supraloop to safely cut the isthmus and uterine transcervical fragmentation. To these could be added the previous free-residue diet that further guarantees safety and peroperative convenience and the strong mobilization of the uterus by use of a uterine manipulator. The first stage, performed {{at the onset of the}} surgical procedure, is complete uterus devascularization, by coagulating both uterine arteries at the artery origin and infundibulo-pelvic ligaments or utero-ovarian vessels. This step can be done using the single access but requires strong lateral mobilisation of the uterus by the third operator placed between the patient’s leggs. The second stage involves the section of the isthmus using a monopolar current supraloop which allows doing it rapidly and safely. Then uterine morcellation can be <b>easly</b> performed by introducing the morcellator transcervically.
