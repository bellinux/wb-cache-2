Tech received the post-touchdown kickoff and gained two quick first downs, but after advancing the ball beyond its own 40-yard line, was forced to punt it back to California.|$|E

5|$|Jesé {{opted to}} remain in Madrid for the 2015–16 season as he sought {{to break into the}} first team under new club manager Rafa Benítez. However, he found {{competition}} for places tough and was limited to just 1252 minutes of football across all competitions under Benítez and his successor, Zinedine Zidane. In spite of his lack of <b>game</b> <b>time,</b> Jesé still managed to contribute 6 goals and 8 assists for the season and was a regularly used as back-up in the team's triumphant 2015–16 UEFA Champions League campaign.|$|E
5|$|Jesé {{struggled}} {{to settle in}} Paris, however, {{and by the end}} of the year he had only started in one of his nine league appearances for the club.

5|$|Maryland had {{previously}} shown {{an ability to}} strike quickly on offense and did so again in the game. In the 2008 season, the team scored 18out of 28touchdowns in drives consisting of six or fewer plays or {{less than two minutes}} of <b>game</b> <b>time.</b> This led to the team often trailing opponents in time of possession. In the Humanitarian Bowl, Maryland continued the pattern by scoring in the first 1:01 with a 59-yard Chris Turner pass to Adrian Cannon.

5|$|The 2004 Emerald Bowl was a post-season college {{football}} bowl {{game between the}} New Mexico Lobos and the Navy Midshipmen on December 30, 2004 at SBC Park in San Francisco, California, United States. The game, which Navy won with a final score of 34–19, was highlighted by a 26-play drive from the Midshipmen that took up almost 15 minutes of <b>game</b> <b>time</b> and set {{the record for the}} longest drive in a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) {{college football}} game. The contest was the third time the Emerald Bowl was played and the final game of the 2004 NCAA football season for both teams.|$|E
5|$|The only goal of {{the match}} came in the second half; Arsenal {{substitute}} Gilberto Silva on his debut collected a pass from Dennis Bergkamp and struck the ball through goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek's legs.

5|$|This result marked Manchester United's {{first defeat}} of 1999. It {{was the second}} {{consecutive}} year that Arsenal beat United to win the Charity Shield.

5|$|After Navy forced North Texas {{to begin}} the second quarter with a punt, Midshipmen running back Eric Kettani fumbled {{the ball on the}} second play of the next drive and the Mean Green recovered. The next eight {{possessions}} – four from each team – resulted in touchdowns. Four of the drives took less than a minute of <b>game</b> <b>time</b> to reach the end zone, and a fifth took barely over a minute. In the final two minutes of the half the Midshipmen forced the Mean Green to punt after three plays, and Navy quarterback Kaipo-Noa Kaheaku-Enhada threw a 47-yard pass to running back Reggie Campbell. The Midshipmen ran for another touchdown on the next play. North Texas got the ball back with seven seconds left in the half, but chose not to attempt to score again. At {{the end of the first}} half, the Mean Green led the Midshipmen 49–45.|$|E
5|$|Continuing Navy's {{drive from}} the {{previous}} quarter, Polanco and Eckel continued to run up the middle and {{the right side of}} New Mexico's defense for small gains. Polanco attempted two passes, the first of which was incomplete and the second to slotback Marco Nelson for a first down at the Midshipmen 44-yard line. After 12 plays and over six minutes of <b>game</b> <b>time,</b> the drive reached midfield. After six more rushing plays from Polanco, Eckel, and slotback Eric Roberts, the team reached the Lobos' 28-yard line. Needing three yards to achieve a fourth down conversion, Navy coach Paul Johnson called a time-out. On the next play, Frank Divis threw his second halfback option pass of the day to Polanco, gaining six yards to keep the drive alive. Eckel, Divis, and Roberts rushed for six more plays before the drive came to a halt at the Lobos' 5-yard line. On the final play of the drive, Midshipman kicker Geoff Blumenfeld kicked a 22-yard field goal to make the score 34–19 with 2:07 left in the game.|$|E
5|$|Each side then {{attempted}} to rush all available pilots into the system, and the game's time dilation software engaged. Time dilation {{is a game}} feature created by developer CCP Games to handle heavy loads on the game server without the game lagging or disconnecting players. In time dilation, the game slows to ten percent normal speed, with each second of <b>game</b> <b>time</b> displaying as ten seconds of real time. The two sides traded Titan kills every hour, when their Doomsday weapons could fire again, and the system became filled with warp disruption bubbles, making extraction difficult. For a while neither side gained any real advantage, though CFC/Rus managed to on-line their Territorial Control Units and held a slight lead {{in the number of}} enemy Titans destroyed. Throughout the engagement, related battles played out across the entire game universe as fleets tried to block reinforcements, destroy fleeing capitals and super-capitals, or trap pilots attempting to enter the fray.|$|E

5|$|Following the Nebraska kickoff, Tech {{tried to}} answer the Cornhusker score with one of its own. The Hokies started at their 20-yard line after a touchback. Parker caught an eight-yard pass from Druckenmiller, then ran for three yards and a first down. With a first down at the Tech 31-yard line, Druckenmiller threw an {{incomplete}} pass. This {{was followed by a}} four-yard run by Oxendine and a ten-yard completion by Druckenmiller for another first down, this time to the Tech 45-yard line. Oxendine picked up three yards on two short runs, then Druckenmiller advanced the Hokies into the Nebraska side of the field with a 19-yard pass to Jennings. Oxendine was stopped for no gain and Druckenmiller threw an incompletion, but on third down, Druckenmiller connected with White for a 33-yard gain and Tech's first touchdown of the second half. The extra point was good, and the Hokies again trimmed Nebraska's lead to three points: 2421. Tech's drive covered 80 yards in 12 plays and 4:56 of <b>game</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the game, players fight various monsters as they {{explore the}} pyramid's halls and catacombs. Players may pick up weapons and {{ammunition}} {{left behind by}} others to supplement their arsenal. As additional levels are unlocked, new weapons become available, including machine guns and grenade launchers. Players can absorb {{a certain amount of}} damage, but once their health reaches zero, they must resume their progress at the last saved checkpoint. Resting in place replenishes health but saps <b>game</b> <b>time</b> and leaves the player open to attack. Scattered throughout the levels are other items players may use. Potions have different effects: rare blue potions, for example, rid the player character of poison and damage. Otherwise items provide points or cash; every four points increases the player character's maximum health by two units. Crystals can be used against enemies to freeze, burn, or otherwise harm them.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{retains the}} relic Poseidon's Trident from the {{original}} installment, and gains new relics; the Amulet of the Fates, the Golden Fleece, and Icarus' Wings, each being required to advance through certain stages of the game.

The Golden Fleece deflects enemy projectiles back at the enemies (used to solve certain puzzles).
