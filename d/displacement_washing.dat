40|$|Washing {{is simply}} bulk {{removal of the}} liquor {{surrounding}} the pulp fibers. In a laboratory washing cell, the mechanism of the <b>displacement</b> <b>washing</b> of unbleached Kraft pulp was investigated. The efficiency of <b>displacement</b> <b>washing</b> depends {{on the degree of}} mixing and also on the rate of desorption and diffusion of dissolved solids and chemicals from the pulp fibers. Using the step function input change method, the washing breakthrough curves obtained experimentally were described by the axially dispersed plug flow model. A correlation between Peclet numbers, Kappa numbers the wash yield, and pH of wash liquid was derived as well. The level of sorbed sodium varies with kappa number and pH. The effect of the superficial wash liquid velocity and of the mobility of displacing and displaced liquids upon the axial dispersion coefficient was discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>displacement</b> <b>washing</b> of packed bed of porous, compressible and cylindrical particles, e. g., fibers, is {{presented with the}} help of an axial dispersion model involving Peclet number (Pe) and Biot number (Bi). Bulk fluid concentration, intra-pore solute concentration and concentration of solute adsorbed on the fiber surface are taken to be the function of washing time and position in the bed. Concentration of solute adsorbed on the fiber surface and intra-pore solute concentration are related by a Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Experiments have been performed on pulp beds formed from unbeaten, unbleached kraft fibers. <b>Displacement</b> <b>washing</b> has been simulated using a laboratory washing cell. Model equations are solved by using orthogonal collocation on finite elements (OCFE). Model predicted values are compared with the experimental values and key industrial parameters such as displacement ratio and efficiency are expressed in terms of exit and average solute concentrations...|$|E
40|$|A new {{experimental}} {{technique has}} been developed in order to study the washing characteristics in a filter cake during <b>displacement</b> <b>washing.</b> The test material primarily used was paper pulp which forms highly heterogeneous filter cakes where the local values of, for example, porosity may be assumed to differ substantially from the average values. The experimental equipment used was a piston filter press equipped with a γ-radiation source and a scintillation detector {{that was used to}} measure concentrations of different species inside the filter cake at different bed heights. In these experiments, Cs+ ions were used as the tracer compound for studying <b>displacement</b> <b>washing.</b> The filtrate was also collected and, from the displacement curves based on the concentration in the filtrate, the dispersion coefficients and the Peclet number could be determined; these values were used to calculate local displacement curves. The calculated local displacement curves agreed well with the measured local displacement curves showing that local measurement of the dispersion coefficient is a very valuable tool for studying the washing of filter cakes...|$|E
50|$|Sparkes and Detective Senior Constable Gavin Dengate {{responded to}} an urgent call for {{assistance}} {{to rescue a}} boy trapped in a flooded storm water drain. From {{the entrance of the}} drain, an object, believed to be the missing child, could be seen about 80-100 metres away. Tied to a rope, Sparkes entered the drain and was rapidly washed 20 metres along the pipe by the ferocity of the current before realising the rope was inadequate. With a more substantial line, he re-entered the drain even though breathing space in the pipe had been reduced by the rising flood waters and his own bulk <b>displacement.</b> Flood waters <b>washed</b> him some 80 metres downstream before he could establish that the object was only debris. The drain was now almost totally engulfed in flood water, leaving only a small air space, and Sparkes was in danger of drowning as frantic attempts were made by his colleague and others to haul him against the flow to the surface.|$|R

Non-linear model equations are solved using cubic Hermite collocation method (HCM) to compute exit and average solute concentrations. Effect of different parameters such as Peclet number, intraparticle diffusion coefficient and bed porosity (ε) {{has been discussed}} theoretically as well as graphically.

40|$|The washing of filter cakes, {{especially}} the <b>displacement</b> <b>washing,</b> represents {{an important aspect}} in science researches and industrial applications. A lot of ongoing researches are focussed on impurities, which are dissolved in the mother liquid (e. g. sodium chloride) and washed out with the identical pure liquid without impurities.

40|$|<b>Displacement</b> <b>washing</b> is an {{operation}} {{in which it}} is possible to wash solid-phase particles with a minimum of water. In a sulfate pulp mill, the main application is the pulp washing, but lime mud washing also occurs in the chemical recovery. The washing consumes a great deal of water. For environmental reasons there is an interest in increasing closure of the liquor systems. This means that excess water is a ballast which has to be pumped around or evaporated, and the water consumption should be kept as low as possible. It also means that non-process elements (NPE), will accumulate in the system and reach levels which may be harmful, e. g. in the bleaching operation. In order to handle the NPE problem, one important factor is the knowledge of how to make an effective separation in the pulp washing operation. Another crucial washing operation is that of lime mud, since it also influences the lime kiln operation and, later on, the quality of the white liquor produced. Hence, a knowledge of the phenomena that govern the <b>displacement</b> <b>washing</b> operation is crucial for the pulping industry to be able to meet the demands in an economically feasible way. Better knowledge of the phenomena also means more accurate models. The pulp fibre and the lime mud are examples of completely different solids, which lead to different conditions in the <b>displacement</b> <b>washing</b> operation. They are therefore suitable both to illustrate aspects of the <b>displacement</b> <b>washing,</b> and for examining conditions in general. In this thesis, studies on both lime mud and pulp are presented. Due to the great differences between the two solid phases studied, there are different phenomena that dominate the <b>displacement</b> <b>washing</b> operation. While lime mud particles form relatively homogeneous beds having small to moderate interactions with the stationary phase, the pulp fibres form more heterogeneous beds having complex stationary phase interactions, regarding both stagnant liquor and the actual fibre. In the lime mud study the dispersion model was found to give good agreement with experimental data, except for a small tailing {{at the end of the}} breakthrough curve. This could be improved by adding a disturbance term to the inlet boundary condition. No effect of pore diffusion could be seen, due to the small size of the particles, whereas there was a noticeable sorption effect. The dispersion coefficient was higher than for more ideally formed particles, and it depended on the type of salt in the solution. This is probably due to pH variations causing changes in the bed structure. The linear adsorption coefficient results were not quite satisfactory, but still showed some dependence on lime mud type and salt type. For pulp fibres, the study of the sorption of metal ions showed that the general sorption behaviour for mono- and divalent ions can be described with a Langmuir isotherm. The Langmuir isotherm could also be used for multi-ion solutions, when adding the influence of the charges on the fibre and the second power of the charges in the solution. The sorption was found to be slightly temperature-dependent. The sorption of ion pairs could be described by separation factors, showing a preference for divalent ions over monovalent ions on the fibre. The separation factors showed that the Mn 2 + ions, which are harmful in modern bleaching, were more strongly bound than Mg 2 +, which is more preferable for the bleaching operation. This study of lignin diffusion out of the fibre wall showed that it could be divided into a short time diffusion and a long time diffusion. The difference is probably due to that the outer layers of the fibre wall have a more open structure than the inner layers, yielding a higher diffusivity during the time these layers are emptied. The short time diffusion is the dominant part for the times used in pulp washing. The increase in diffusivity due to temperature is more rapid above 80 - 90 °C...|$|E

A computer automated and well controlled apparatus was used to acquire data for filter cycles comprising combinations of filtration, <b>displacement</b> <b>washing</b> and gas deliquoring. The influence of a matrix of parameters such as applied pressure gradient and cake thickness was examined to establish the scale-up parameters required for use in process simulations.

40|$|The tailing {{effect in}} the <b>displacement</b> <b>washing</b> {{operation}} of lime mud in the {{pulp and paper industry}} was investigated using two different model approaches. Both approaches utilise the dispersion model, the first approach adding micropore diffusion and particle size distribution, the second adding a disturbance in the inlet boundary condition. To investigate the models, washing tests were performed in an apparatus in which a filter cake was formed and subsequently washed. The parameters in the washing experiments were type of lime mud, type of salt as solute, flow velocity and bed length. It was found that a good fit could be obtained with the inlet disturbance model, while the micropore diffusion model could not explain the tailing in a satisfactory way.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to develop, and {{evaluate}} a concept for a new pulp feeding system to one pulping processing machineries.

After the pre-study concepts generated, and evaluated, one was selected to continue working with washing process. The selected concept will further evaluated through personnel visit to the chemical/mechanical pulping industries. And the potential will be find out from the result. In the pulp washing machine and method therefore, pulp to be washed is fed between the rotating drum and the pressing roll inside it, so that pulp passes along a spiral-formed track around the pressing roll, being thereby pressed several times. Washing liquid is fed to the pulp at one or several points along its track of movement, between the pressings and/or at the pressing position. Washing thus takes place partly as diffusion and partly as a <b>displacement</b> <b>washing</b> process. Washing is efficient and reduces the breaking of pulp fibers down to a minimum...|$|E
40|$|The actual {{mechanism}} {{controlling the}} extraction of sucrose from cane in diffusers is still in dispute. It is generally believed that <b>displacement</b> <b>washing</b> or lixiviation is the governing process. Cane diffusers have been adapted from the vegetable oil extraction industry via the beet industry. A considerable portion of Chemical Engineering solid-liquid extraction design theory has been developed in the vegetable oil industry where it is generally accepted that molecular diffusion from within {{to the surface of}} the solid material is the rate controlling mechanism, followed by surface washing-eddy diffusion. In the present paper the McCabe-Smith calculation is used to determine the number of ideal stages for an average diffuser on the basis of constant underflow. The stage efficiency is calculated from a knowledge of the diffusion coefficient and particle size distribution in the feed. These data are available from laboratory and pilot scale tests. From the number of ideal stages and stage efficiency, the number of actual stages is calculated giving results which are in close agreement with the number of stages used in existing cane and first bagasse diffusers. It is concluded therefore that the theoryisapplicable to cane diffuser design and that molecular diffusion within the cane particles is the controlling mechanism. 1...|$|E
40|$|During {{the process}} of making pulp from wood, free fibers are mixed in a pulp {{suspension}} containing a large amount of water (98 - 50 % by mass), wood fibers and often some processing chemicals. The suspension in this process is gradually cleaned from dissolved material. The suspension can be washed in a <b>displacement</b> <b>washing</b> step where the dirty fluid is replaced with a cleaner one. or by a compression step which increases the consistency of the suspension. To reduce costs and to increase the production rate of pulp and paper overall {{it is important to understand}} the interaction between fluid and fibers in such processes. During dewatering and washing, fibers are exposed to a drag force from the fluid. As the concentration of fibers increases this drag force and, consequently, the pressure generated from it become proportional to the permeability of the fiber network formed. When contact between fibers increases, an additional pressure emanates caused by bending and compressing of the fibers. By comparing experiments to a numerical model this study shows that for high dewatering velocities the resulting force required to dewater a suspension cannot be found by adding these two pressures. One reason for this may be that intra-fiber flows contribute to the force. Another explanation can be related to reinforcementGodkänd; 2008; Bibliografisk uppgift: CD-ROM; 20080828 (ysko...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to compare the efficiency of counter-current and co-current filter cake washing techniques. Filter cake washing is a common unit operation which {{is used in the}} chemical process industry for improving the recovery of the liquid phase or for purifying the solid phase of the filter cake. Counter-current <b>displacement</b> <b>washing</b> is more difficult to arrange and it requires additional process equipment but the advantage of counter-current method is that the consumption of wash water that is required for achieving certain filter cake purity may be considerably decreased when compared to the co-current washing method. This is true especially for materials that are difficult to wash. The literature part of this thesis consists of a review of filter cake washing in general, including the basic principles of co-current and counter-current techniques, and a description of the structure and operation of a horizontal vacuum belt filter, which is the equipment considered in the experimental part of this thesis. Also the most common cake washing models are introduced. The experiments were performed by washing wheat apatite filter cakes in a laboratory scale vacuum filter by using both co-current and counter-current washing methods. The main results of these tests were the washing curves that relate the purity of the filter cake to the amount of wash liquid used. Comparison between the obtained washing curves showed that both washing methods could be efficiently applied for achieving good washing results. The differences between the wash liquid consumptions in the co-current and counter-current washing methods were found to be surprisingly small but this is most probably explained by the relatively good washing characteristics of the apatite cakes. The washing models introduced in the literature part were compared with the results obtained from the experiments and it was found out that the studied cake washing processes could be describe...|$|E
40|$|Municipal Solid Waste combustion, {{as one of}} {{the waste}} {{management}} tools, starts {{to play an important role}} nowadays in heat and energy generation. However, MSW combustion leads to generation of other wastes - combustion residues, including ashes, which require a proper management. Thus, a lot of efforts have been directed towards minimization or elimination of negative impact on the environment when ash is land filled or utilized and thus different treatment options for fly ashes are presently being tested. This study is focused on testing a treatment method for cyclone ash from MSW combustion in Bubbling Fluidised Bed Boiler. The proposed method is based on effective leaching of the ash with water to release easily soluble salts, mainly NaCl and KCl, from the ash. The leaching step is followed by filtration and washing. The study was carried out in two stages: laboratory scale experiments and pilot plant scale experiments. The washing process tested under laboratory conditions consisted of the following steps: the cyclone ash and de-ionized water was mixed in a leaching reactor and after a specified residence time, the slurry was filtered and finally washed with de-ionized water in a filtration unit. The laboratory tests provided necessary data for continuation of the research in the pilot plant scale. The pilot plant consisted of a leaching unit, a filtration/washing unit, a storage tank and an ash bin. The whole washing process, except for the filtration step, was working in continuous mode. The findings from the research show that the proposed treatment process works very well for this type of ash. The leaching with water results in a relatively quick release of soluble salts from the ash. The ash/water slurry seemed to be a suitable material for mechanical separation in the filter unit, independently of the L/S slurry ratio applied. The mother liquor (leaching liquor) trapped in the filter cake can be washed out by <b>displacement</b> <b>washing</b> using a water volume twice is the volume of the mother liquor. Thus, an overall liquid to solid ratio at 1 seems to be reasonable low and still sufficient to reduce the leaching of soluble components from the washed ash. At this liquid to solid ratio the leaching liquor is still far from being saturated in respect to NaCl and KCl. The cyclone ash washed in the pilot plant passed two leaching tests (batch leaching test and the column test) that are proposed as European standard methods for the evaluation of particulate waste...|$|E
40|$|Abstract There {{are many}} aspects {{on how to}} improve the paper pulping process. In the washing {{sequence}} improvements to decrease the discharge to the environment can be achieved by closure of the liquid system and recycling liquid from other parts pulp process. The objective of the pulp washing operation is to remove the liquor containing organic material such as dissolved lignin, and also inorganic material including the so called non-process elements. Cations, for example iron, manganese, magnesium etc. fall under the category non-process elements. These cations are very important to remove in the washing sequence since they cause problems during bleaching by decomposing the bleaching chemicals. The cations also cause filtration failure and incrust formation in the evaporator system. The washing should be performed with minimum amount of water to avoid diluting the liquor that is later evaporated before it is burnt in the recovery boiler. To investigate various aspects of pulp washing a simulation model is helpful. Using a process simulator such as ASPEN Plus the different steps in a displacement drum washer can be described. In order to take account for the sorption of cations ions on the pulp fibres, blocks with an equilibrium model has to be included. The equilibrium model is encoded using FORTRAN. In the literature different models have been presented to take account for the sorption effects, the Langmuir isotherm, the Donnan model and the distribution coefficient model. In the presentation a comparison between these models is be made and how the simulation results are be influenced. Comparing the three adsorption models, The Donnan model was found to need the most data for the specific set of pulp and ions, second in that aspect is the Langmuir isotherm, and least amount of data are required for the distribution constant model. Results from the simulation show that the influence of the sorption model and thus also the choice of model is important only in washing stages where the concentration of ions is very low. One way to decrease the water consumption {{and at the same time}} decrease the release of process water to the environment is to use condensate as washliquid. Condensates are produced in the cooking section and in the evaporator system. Depending on the origin of condensates they contain different amount of impurities, methanol, COD and sulfite substances for example. Sulfite substances have a very strong odour even at low concentration levels and can therefore cause problems both in the process and in the final product. Condensates do, however, have very low concentration of cations and are therefore suitable as washliquid. To investigate the possibility of using condensate as washliquid washing experiments were performed on bleached and unbleached pulp. The two pulps were washed with four condensates with different concentration of COD. The washing results were consistently good but some unexpected results were obtained for the case where the condensate with the highest concentration of COD was used. The characteristic of the pulp was then investigated by an adsorption study including manganese, calcium and magnesium.

40|$|The current {{strategy}} for removal of cesium from the Hanford waste stream is ion-exchange using spherical Resorcinol-Formaldehyde (sRF) resin. The original resin of choice was granular SuperLig 644 resin and during testing of this resin several operational issues were identified. For example, the granular material {{had a high}} {{angle of internal friction}} resulting in fragmentation of resin particles along its edges during cycling and adverse hydraulic performance. Efforts to replace SuperLig 644 were undertaken and one candidate was the granular Resorcinol-Formaldehyde (RF) resin where experience with this cation exchanger dates back to the late 1940 's. To minimize hydraulic concerns a spherical version of RF was developed and several different chemically produced batches were created. The 5 E- 370 / 641 batch of sRF was selected and for the last decade numerous studies have been performed (e. g., batch contact tests, column loading and elution tests). The Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) flowsheet shows that the aqueous phase waste stream will have a wide range of ionic concentrations (e. g., during the loading step 0 - 3 M free OH, 5 + M Na, 0 - 1 M K, 0 - 3 M NO{sub 3 }). Several steps are required in the ion-exchange process to achieve the required Cs separation factors: loading, <b>displacement,</b> <b>washing,</b> elution, and regeneration. The sRF resin will be operated over a wide range in pH (i. e., pH of 12 - 14 during the loading step and pH of 0. 01 - 1 during the elution step). During some of these steps very high levels of counter-ions and co-ions will be present within the aqueous phase. Alternative process feeds are under consideration as well (e. g., sodium levels as high as 8 M and column operation up to 45 C during loading, reduced and recycled HNO{sub 3 } during elution). In order to model the performance of sRF resin through an entire ion-exchange cycle, a more robust isotherm model is required. To achieve this more robust isotherm model requires knowledge of the numbers and kinds of fixed ionogenic groups that make up sRF. Recent literature reviews and scoping titration tests strongly indicate that sRF is a polyfunctional cation exchange resin with at least three dominant types of ring groups playing a role in its isotherm behavior over the wide pH range of operations. Also three types of fixed ionogenic acid groups are present: sulfonic (SO{sub 3 }H{sup -}) groups; carboxylic (COOH{sup -}) groups, and resorcylic (OH{sup -}) groups. It is this premise that we are working under {{in the development of a}} robust isotherm model for sRF over its entire planned pH operating range. The application of prototypic isotherms for modeling ion-exchange column behavior is demonstrated in Section 3 of this report. This preliminary work served to focus the development effort on the use of a mass-action based isotherm. In Section 4 of this report, the foundational material required to develop a robust isotherm model for sRF is provided. The paths taken, and choices made, are given for the reader to better understand our current status with respect to this goal and to highlight our most recent understanding of sRF exchange equilibria. Our ultimate goal is to update the CERMOD code (Aleman and Hamm, 2007) with a robust isotherm model for sRF that spans the entire pH and concentration ranges of planned operations. The isotherm model will then be used in the VERSE-LC code to model an entire ion-exchange cycle...|$|E
