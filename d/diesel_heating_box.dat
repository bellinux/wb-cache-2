40|$|Abstract only availableThe white gene in Drosophila melanogaster {{codes for}} a {{half-size}} ABC transporter. We {{have identified a}} role of this transporter in <b>heat</b> <b>box</b> spatial learning. In the <b>heat</b> <b>box</b> paradigm, flies are allowed to move freely in a small dark chamber. During the training phase, when a fly enters a specified half of the chamber, the whole chamber adjusts to the heated probe temperature. When the fly moves to the other half, the chamber temperature adjusts to the preferred reference point. Flies can be conditioned within minutes to avoid the half of the chamber associated with negative temperature. This is especially important in understanding reinforcement processing, a key aspect of learning that is distinct from memory acquisition. An intriguing finding is that mutant eye color severity can be dissociated from performance deficits in the <b>heat</b> <b>box.</b> This finding leads to the hypothesis that systems requiring white-ABC Transporter function for conditioning are not similarly sensitive to the mutations as eye coloration. However, these behavioral measurements were done in flies with an undefined background, therefore leaving open room for several possible alternative explanations. In order to re-asses the eye-color/performance relationship, the same white mutant alleles tested previously were out-crossed to our wild-type strain and will be tested in <b>heat</b> <b>box</b> conditioning. These results will challenge the hypothesis that there are differently sensitive sites at the white locus for eye-pigment and memory formation.

40|$|An {{irreversible}} cycle {{model of}} a <b>Diesel</b> <b>heat</b> engine is established and used to investigate the influence of multi-irreversibilities, which mainly result from the non-isentropic compression and expansion processes, finite rate heat transfer processes and heat leak loss through the cylinder wall, {{on the performance of}} the cycle. Expressions for the power output and efficiency of the cycle are derived by introducing the pressure ratio and the compression and expansion efficiencies. The characteristic curves of the power output and efficiency, varying with the pressure ratio, and the power output versus efficiency are obtained. It is found from the curves that there are optimal values of the pressure ratio at which the power output and efficiency attain, respectively, their maxima. Moreover, the effects of the various irreversibilities and the highest temperature of the working substance on the performance of the cycle are discussed in detail. The optimum criteria of some important parameters, such as the power output, efficiency and pressure ratio, are obtained, and consequently, the optimal operating region of an irreversible <b>Diesel</b> <b>heat</b> engine is determined.

[...] RESUMO [...] A rede escolar do ensino básico no concelho de Viseu abrange 105 escolas distribuídas pelas suas 34 freguesias. Os sistemas de aquecimento são maioritariamente compostos por pequenos fogões alimentados a lenha. No entanto, esta tendência tem vindo a alterar-se na medida em que a autarquia pretende modificar os sistemas de aquecimento a lenha para sistemas de aquecimento central a diesel. Com este trabalho pretendeu-se comparar, do ponto de vista ambiental, as escolas que dispõem de sistemas de aquecimento a lenha com as escolas que apresentam sistemas de aquecimento a diesel. A metodologia utilizada na comparação ambiental dos dois sistemas de aquecimento foi a Análise de Ciclo de Vida (ACV). Os resultados foram obtidos com recurso ao software SimaPro, tendo-se concluído que os sistemas de aquecimento a lenha são do ponto de vista ambiental preferíveis aos sistemas a diesel para a maioria das categorias de impacte consideradas.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of indoor thermal environment {{has been carried}} out by computational fluid dynamics approach. The study focuses on the thermal comfort evaluation, particularly the flow and heat transfer effects due to conjugate natural convection, furniture arrangement and occupant number, and flow oscillations. Key physical features of thermo-fluid such as velocity and temperature distributions, thermal sensation maps, and oscillation frequency and its energy are quantified, analysed and compared. The benchmark case study of airflow and heat transfer showed that ANSYS Fluent RNG k - 5 turbulence model with temperature boundary condition on the heated boundary calculated the bestresults, compared with available data. It also showed that air velocity increased along the boundary walls and especially hot wall which led flow direction upwards. At the centre of the flow circulation, air momentum is very weak (e. g. almost zero velocity magnitude). The increase of complex features (6. g. a <b>box</b> with/without <b>heat)</b> in the domain would lead to flow separations causing recirculations above the box and in the rear space of the domain and swirls in the front space presenting three-dimensional flow, and a thermal plume, compared with a two-dimensional clockwise flow in an empty room. The flow recirculations and thermal buoyancy enhanced velocity magnitude and turbulence level in the domain. In fact, the highest frequency was obtained in the room with an unheated box, followed by the room with a <b>heated</b> <b>box.</b> The forrhation of thermal plume from the <b>heated</b> <b>box</b> stabilised the flow in the upper part and the sides of the <b>heated</b> <b>box</b> on a spanwise plane. The frequency of velocity oscillation was consistent with temperature at the location although the energy of the fluctuation is much higher in temperature. Moreover the dominant frequency depended on the orientation of the flow circulation, for example a high energy at a lower frequency on a spanwise plane while a low energy at a higher frequency on a streamwise plane. In an empty room, it was found that there is no direct relation in an empty room (case 3. 2. 1) between velocity and turbulent flow in power spectral density and frequency, and each of time-history velocity oscillations is independent and random. At the mid- height of the domain, the energy of the velocity fluctuation is relatively weak. The results from the study of conjugate natural convection heat transfer in a ventilated room with localised heat source and window glazing showed that the size of heat source and window glazing, the wall thickness and wall material property are important factors to temperature change and heat loss.
