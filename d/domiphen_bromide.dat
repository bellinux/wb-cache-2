50|$|<b>Domiphen</b> <b>bromide</b> is a {{chemical}} antiseptic and a quaternary ammonium compound.|$|E
50|$|The active {{ingredients}} of Scope Outlast are cetylpyridinium chloride, <b>domiphen</b> <b>bromide,</b> and denatured alcohol.|$|E
5000|$|Benzalkonium chloride, {{benzethonium}} chloride, methylbenzethonium chloride, cetalkonium chloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimonium, cetrimide, dofanium chloride, tetraethylammonium bromide, and <b>domiphen</b> <b>bromide</b> - antimicrobial ingredients {{found in}} various over-the-counter products ...|$|E
50|$|Quaternary {{ammonium}} compounds {{have also}} been shown to have antimicrobial activity. Certain quaternary ammonium compounds, especially those containing long alkyl chains, are used as antimicrobials and disinfectants. Examples are benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, methylbenzethonium chloride, cetalkonium chloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimonium, cetrimide, dofanium chloride, tetraethylammonium bromide, didecyldimethylammonium chloride and <b>domiphen</b> <b>bromide.</b> Also good against fungi, amoebas, and enveloped viruses, quaternary ammonium compounds are believed to act by disrupting the cell membrane. Quaternary ammonium compounds are lethal {{to a wide variety of}} organisms except endospores, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and non-enveloped viruses.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of undecylenic acid on the fungistatic effect of phenoxyethyldimethyldodecylammonium bromide (<b>Domiphen</b> <b>bromide)</b> against Trichophyton mentagrophytes was investigated. The {{unsaturated fatty acid}} was found to enhance the fungistatic activity of <b>Domiphen</b> <b>bromide</b> against this organism. The ratio of concentrations of these agents has a marked influence {{on the results of}} in vitro tests for antifungal action resulting in a completely different effect than heretofore noted in combination experiments against bacteria. The enhancing phenomenon is not particular to T. mentagrophytes, it was observed also with Candida albicans...|$|E
40|$|FUNGI MAY BECOME ETIOLOGIC AGENTS UNDER A VARIETY OF CONDITIONS THAT PRODUCE AN ALTERED HOST RESPONSE. HOST RESPONSE IS COMPROMISED WITH LEUCEMIA, LEMPHOMATOUS DISEASES, APLASTIC ANAEMIA AND CANCER WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT DEBILITATINGDISEASE. UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE MYCOSES ARE NOT ONLY DUE TO PATHOGENIC FUNGI BUT THEY ARE ALSO CAUSED BY SAPROPHYTIC FUNGI EXISTING IN THE ENVIRONMENT, THE SKIN, OR IN THE MUCOSA OF PATIENTS AND PEOPLE WORKING IN A HOSPITAL. THESE FUNGI ARE USUALLY UBIQUITOUS IN NATURE, AND THEY ARE CALLED "OPPORTUNISTIC". THIS RESEARCH INVESTIGATED THE FREQUENCY OF YEASTS IN THE MOUTH MUCOSA OF CERTAIN PATIENT CATEGORIES: COMPROMISED HOSTS DUE TO DIMINISHED CELLULARIMMUNITY (GROUP A), HOST WITH REDUCED NORMAL FLORA DUE TO ADMINISTRATION OF BROAD SPECTRUM ANTIBIOTICS (GROUP B), DUE TO ADMINISTRATION OF CORTICOSTEROIDS (GROUP C), AND DUE TO ADMINISTRATION OF CYTOSTATICS OR IMMUNOSUPRESSIVES (GROUP D). THE GROUP (E), CONSISTED OF SAMPLES TAKEN FROM PEOPLE IN THE HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT, THAT IS NURSES AND DOCTORS, OTHER HOSPITAL PERSONEL AND VISITORS. THE SAME SUBJECTS WERE USED TO ASSURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT ANTISEPTICS USED FOR ORAL DISINFECTION. THESE WERE AS FOLLOWS: POVIDONE IODINE, <b>DOMIPHEN</b> <b>BROMIDE,</b> PHENYLMERCURIC BORATE AND HEXETIDINE. THE SUBJECTS WERE CHECKED BEFORE THE (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED) ...|$|E
40|$|Tuberculosis is {{a serious}} threat to world-wide public health usually caused in humans by Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (M. tuberculosis). It exclusively utilizes the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway for biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), the precursors of all isoprenoid compounds. The 4 -diphosphocytidyl- 2 -C-methyl-d-erythritol synthase (IspD; EC 2. 7. 7. 60) is the key enzyme of the MEP pathway. It is also of interest as a new chemotherapeutic target, as the enzyme is absent in mammals and ispD is an essential gene for growth. A high-throughput screening method was therefore developed to identify compounds that inhibit IspD. This process was applied to identify a lead compound, <b>domiphen</b> <b>bromide</b> (DMB), that may effectively inhibit IspD. The inhibitory action of DMB was confirmed by over-expressing or down-regulating IspD in Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis), demonstrating that DMB inhibit M. smegmatis growth additionally through an IspD-independent pathway. This also led to higher levels of growth inhibition when combined with IspD knockdown. This novel IspD inhibitor was also reported to exhibit antimycobacterial activity in vitro, an effect that likely occurs as a result of perturbation of cell wall biosynthesis...|$|E
