500|$|By 1974, Patti Smith was {{performing}} rock music, initially with guitarist, bassist and rock archivist Lenny Kaye, and {{later with a}} full band comprising Kaye, Ivan Kral on guitar and bass, Jay Dee Daugherty on drums and Richard Sohl on piano. Ivan Kral was a refugee from Czechoslovakia who {{had moved to the}} United States in 1966 with his parents, who were diplomats. After the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, Kral decided not to return. Financed by Sam Wagstaff, the band recorded a first single, [...] "Hey Joe / Piss Factory", in 1974. The A-side was a version of the rock standard {{with the addition of a}} spoken word piece about fugitive heiress Patty Hearst ("Patty Hearst, you're standing there in front of the Symbionese Liberation Army flag with your legs spread, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women..."). A court later heard that Hearst had been confined against her will, and had been repeatedly threatened with execution and raped. The B-side describes the helpless anger Smith had felt while working on a factory assembly line and the salvation she discovered in the form of a shoplifted book, the 19th century French poet Arthur Rimbaud's Illuminations. In a 1996 interview which discusses artistic influences during her younger years, Smith said, [...] "I had devoted so much of my girlish daydreams to Rimbaud. Rimbaud was like my boyfriend." ...|$|E
500|$|Speculation ignited that Ponting was an {{outsider}} {{to be selected}} for the Australian squad on their 1993 tour to England. Of the speculation, Ponting said [...] "At {{the start of the}} season <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> whether or not I'd play Shield cricket this year and all of a sudden there's talk in the papers that I'm a chance go on an Australian tour of England. I think it's way out of reach — there are blokes like [...] Jamie Siddons who have scored 20 or 30 first-class centuries who are ahead of me. Nevertheless, Shipperd thought Ponting could handle the experience: [...] "A lot of attention affects different people in different ways, but Ricky is such a well-rounded young fella that it hasn't changed him. I've told him to enjoy the all the attention and if he just keeps on being himself I'm sure he'll cope well with all the success that I imagine he will achieve." [...] The selectors eventually chose Western Australian batsman Damien Martyn for the tour, with Ponting selected in the Academy squad captained by Justin Langer, which toured India and Sri Lanka for seven games in August and September in 1993. Australian success was limited, with only a few wins. No batsman scored a century, but Ponting reached 99 not out in a one-day game in Colombo. He finished the tour second highest in the run-scorers behind Langer.|$|E

Of course his sisters may have told him of it, but I should doubt if they did. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wondering</b> if he found it {{described}} in any old family documents, and if so, where they are now. There are no longer any papers in my possession, as at Miss Harmer's request I gave them all up {{a week after the}} funeral to their new solicitor." ...|$|R

2500|$|In April 2008, Yon {{published}} his second book, Moment of Truth in Iraq, through Richard Vigilante Books. The book describes how U.S. counterinsurgency methods are creating what Yon {{sees as a}} foundation of success in Iraq. Within two weeks of its release date, Moment of Truth entered into Amazon.com's list of Top 10 bestsellers. Yon was quoted by fellow blogger Glenn Reynolds as saying, [...] "That's just wild. Folks really did want that book after all. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> how many people even cared. It's great to know {{that people want to}} really know what's going on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout this period, Eddington lectured on relativity, and was {{particularly}} {{well known for}} his ability to explain the concepts in lay terms as well as scientific. He collected many of these into the Mathematical Theory of Relativity in 1923, which Albert Einstein suggested was [...] "the finest presentation of the subject in any language." [...] He was an early advocate of Einstein's General Relativity, and an interesting anecdote well illustrates his humour and personal intellectual investment: Ludwik Silberstein, a physicist who thought of himself as an expert on relativity, approached Eddington at the Royal Society's (6 November) 1919 meeting where he had defended Einstein's Relativity with his Brazil-Principe Solar Eclipse calculations with some degree of skepticism, and ruefully charged Arthur as one who claimed to be one of three men who actually understood the theory (Silberstein, of course, was including himself and Einstein as the other). When Eddington refrained from replying, he insisted Arthur not be [...] "so shy", whereupon Eddington replied, [...] "Oh, no! <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> who the third one might be!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Boam, who {{was raised}} Catholic, used many {{religious}} themes and metaphors in his script for the film. In preparing the story, he studied grail literature, but ultimately invented new mythology. He made the grail a symbol for faith. He said, [...] "I guess the major given of faith is that it can't be proved otherwise you don't need faith. So that is why I created {{the idea that the}} grail can't be removed (from its hiding place). You can find the grail, but you can't really prove that you found it." [...] When Indiana Jones finally discovers the grail hidden among decoys, its knight guardian tells him that he will die if he drinks from the wrong cup. Boam said that this scene is a metaphor for [...] "the one true God vs. false gods". He worried that the film's religious themes would face criticism from the general audience, as well as religious scholars. He was relieved when the criticism didn't appear, saying, [...] "Nobody working on this movie was a religious scholar... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> if the numerous allusions to Christ in Indiana Jones were going to put people off. I was afraid the kids in the audience would think it was not a very hip subject matter." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ronaldo was {{the last}} Brazilian player {{out of the tunnel}} as the teams entered the field. During the playing of the Brazil {{national}} anthem the camera focused on him throughout, with Ronaldo showing little emotion. Steinberg states that Ronaldo [...] "sleepwalked" [...] through the final in what was a below par performance for the striker, which also saw him injured in a collision with French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Zagallo admitted the fears over Ronaldo affected his team psychologically, and stated [...] "for the whole of the first half <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> whether to take him off", but feared a public outcry in Brazil had he done so. Brazil lost the match to hosts France 3–0. Ronaldo later reflected: [...] "We lost the World Cup but I won another cup - my life." [...] An inquest was launched in Brazil, with team doctor Lídio Toledo telling the commission [...] "imagine if I stopped Ronaldo playing and Brazil lost. At that moment I'd have to go and live on the North Pole." [...] Adrian Williams, professor of clinical neurology at Birmingham University, said that Ronaldo should not have played, saying that he would have been feeling the after effects of the seizure and that [...] "there is no way that he {{would have been able to}} perform to the best of his ability within 24 hours of his first fit – if it was his first fit." [...] Despite his sub-par performance in the final due to his seizure hours earlier, Ronaldo was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament for his performances leading up to the final, and finished the tournament as the joint-third highest scorer.|$|E
