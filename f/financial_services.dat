We offer a framework ‘FraTAct’ for transforming regulation intensive nescient activities of a <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> {{business process}} into intelligent activities. <b>Financial</b> <b>service</b> industries has been experiencing enormous challenges since the last decade. A recent financial crisis has unearthed various weaknesses in terms of administering the <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> industries. In order to prevent the future crisis, the regulators are constantly formulating new rules and also forcing the <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> industry to enact financial regulations in their <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> based application which automates financial operations. A <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> application underpins the <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> business process that contains activities. A nescient activity within a <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> process is prone to the risk of producing an inconsistent outcome that results in severe legal consequences for a financial institute e. g., a bank. In order to avoid these legal consequences, a financial institute should develop their <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> processes by composing activities that should be intelligent to understand and comply with financial regulations. Intelligent activities will produce outcomes that are consistent to financial regulations. It will reduce the possibility of financial regulation noncompliance in <b>financial</b> <b>service</b> process based application...|$|R
