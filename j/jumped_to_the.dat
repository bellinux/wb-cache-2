5|$|The {{following}} year, the Lakers {{and three}} other NBL franchises <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fledgling Basketball Association of America. Mikan led his new league in scoring, and again set a single-season scoring record. The Lakers defeated the Washington Capitols in the 1949 BAA Finals.|$|E
5|$|With the {{formation}} of the American League (AL) as a competitor to the NL, McGann joined many fellow NL players who <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> AL. Following Cardinals teammate John McGraw, who became player-manager of the Baltimore Orioles of the AL before the 1901 season, McGann signed with the Orioles.|$|E
5|$|Flick {{began his}} career in semi-professional {{baseball}} and played in minor league baseball for two years. He was noticed by George Stallings, {{the manager of the}} Phillies, who signed Flick as a reserve outfielder. Flick was pressed into a starting role in 1898 when an injury forced another player to retire. He excelled as a starter. Flick <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Athletics in 1902, but an court injunction prevented him from playing in Pennsylvania. He joined the Naps, where he continued to play for the remainder of his major league career, which was curtailed by a stomach ailment.|$|E

30|$|The method we {{used here}} is to find some regions so that the orbits of (1.5) {{starting}} from them approach the axes as n tends to infinity. For example, in Case III. 1, we constructed the regions B_N, I', III', V' satisfying the requirement that the orbits starting in region B_N∩III' <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> region B_N∩V' and then <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> region B_N∩I' and finally <b>jump</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> region B_N∩III' again. This is somewhat similar to a phenomenon proposed by May and Leonard [16] in the three competition models.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Consider {{a variant}} of the simple random walk on the inte-gers, with the {{following}} transition mechanism. At each site x, <b>the</b> proba-bility of <b>jumping</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right is ω(x) ∈ [1 2, 1), until the first time <b>the</b> pro-cess <b>jumps</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left from site x, from which time onward <b>the</b> probabil-ity of <b>jumping</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right is 1 2. We investigate the transience/recurrence properties of this process in both deterministic and stationary, ergodic environments {ω(x) }x∈Z. In deterministic environments, we also study the speed of the process. 1...|$|R
5|$|In his MLB career, Kelley {{played in}} the National League (NL) for the Boston Beaneaters (1891), Pittsburgh Pirates (1892), Baltimore Orioles (1892–1898), and Brooklyn Superbas (1899–1901), before he <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upstart American League {{to play for the}} Baltimore Orioles (1902). He {{returned}} to the NL with Cincinnati Reds (1902–1906) and Boston Doves (1908). Kelley served as player-manager of the Reds (1902–1905) and Doves (1908). After extending his career in the minor leagues, he coached the Brooklyn Robins (1926), and scouted for the New York Yankees (1915–1916).|$|E
5|$|The first {{match that}} aired was a {{standard}} match between Bret Hart and Hakushi (managed by Shinja). Bret announced before the contest {{that he was}} dedicating his performances to his mother because it was Mother's Day. Jerry Lawler, who faced Bret later in the pay-per-view, watched the match backstage on a monitor. Bret won the contest, when he rolled-up Hakushi to gain a pinfall and end Hakushi's six-month-long undefeated streak. As Hart <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> arena floor after the contest, he appeared to legitimately injure his knee.|$|E
5|$|With the {{formation}} of the American League (AL) as a competitor to the NL, Bresnahan, among others, <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> AL from the NL. John McGraw, manager of the Baltimore Orioles of the AL saw Bresnahan pitch for Chicago, and decided to sign him for the Orioles before the 1901 season. For the Orioles, Bresnahan filled in at catcher behind Wilbert Robinson, and also appeared in the outfield. A faster baserunner than the average catcher, Bresnahan had two inside-the-park home runs on May 30, 1902.|$|E

5|$|With the {{formation}} of the American League (AL) as a competitor to the NL, and rumors that the AL's Detroit Tigers were interested in McGinnity, Brooklyn offered McGinnity a $5,000 contract ($ in current dollar terms) to stay with Brooklyn. McGinnity considered retiring from baseball, but ultimately <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> AL, signing with the Baltimore Orioles of the AL before the 1901 season. He received a salary of $2,800 ($ in current dollar terms), choosing less money in an upstart league for the chance to be reunited with McGraw, who was player-manager and part-owner of the Orioles.|$|E
5|$|Young's career {{started in}} 1890 with the Cleveland Spiders. After eight {{years with the}} Spiders, Young was moved to St. Louis in 1899. After two years there, Young <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> newly created American League, joining the Boston franchise. He was traded back to Cleveland in 1909, before {{spending}} the final two months of {{his career with the}} Boston Rustlers. After his retirement, Young went back to his farm in Ohio, where he stayed until his death at age 88 in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Five former Rams players also <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Browns in 1946: center Mike Scarry, tackle Chet Adams {{and backs}} Gaylon Smith, Tommy Colella and Don Greenwood. Their move {{gave rise to}} a legal battle with the Rams, who left Cleveland for Los Angeles shortly after winning the 1945 NFL {{championship}} rather than compete with the Browns. Reeves, the Rams' owner, filed an injunction against Adams in federal court after he signed with the Browns, claiming the tackle unlawfully broke his contract to play for the Rams. Adams argued he had no obligation under his contract to play for the Rams because the team had changed to the Los Angeles Rams following the move. At the end of August 1946, federal judge Emerich Freed denied the Rams' injunction, allowing Adams to play for the Browns. The judge rejected the Rams' contention that Adams had signed to play for Reeves, not a specific team. He ruled the Cleveland Rams had ceased to exist, and that Adams therefore was not bound to fulfill a contract with the Los Angeles Rams.|$|E

5|$|Flick {{was one of}} many star NL {{players who}} <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fledgling American League (AL) after the 1901 season, playing for the crosstown Philadelphia Athletics. Flick played in 11 games for the Athletics, before the Phillies {{obtained}} an injunction from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court prohibiting any player under contract with the Phillies from playing for another team. Though this injunction named Lajoie, Bill Bernhard, and Chick Fraser only, it still applied to Flick as well. As a recourse, Flick and teammate Lajoie signed instead with the Cleveland Naps, as the Pennsylvania injunction could not be enforced in Ohio. The two players often traveled separately from their teammates for the next year, never setting foot in Pennsylvania in order to avoid a subpoena. Flick spent the remainder of his career in Cleveland, and the contract dispute was resolved when the leagues made peace in September 1903 with the National Agreement.|$|E
5|$|The seventh {{match was}} the main event from SmackDown, a Punjabi Prison match for the World Heavyweight Championship, where, Batista, defended the title against The Great Khali. In the match, two giant wooden cages {{surrounded}} the ring, and, to win, a competitor had to escape both structures. After both men prevented the other from escaping, Khali utilized a leather strap as a weapon. Batista later used the leather strap and attempted to climb over inner cage, but Khali stopped him and squeezed Batista's head with a Vise Grip. Khali then called for a door to be opened but Batista struck him with a low blow. The match ended when Khali had climbed over the inner cage and began climbing the outer cage. Batista then mounted the inner cage, <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second cage and, overtaking Khali, climbed to the ground, thereby winning the match and retaining the title.|$|E
25|$|Bianculli {{worked as}} a TV critic for the Ft.

In 1987, he was named TV critic for the New York Post, then <b>jumped</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rival New York Daily News, where he remained from 1993 to 2007. Bianculli also briefly served as TV critic for the TV trade magazine Broadcasting & Cable.|$|E

In 1915, Lalonde held out in contract negotiations, only playing six games, but aside from that, he remained with the Canadiens for the next ten years, winning the NHA scoring title again in 1916 and captaining the Canadiens to his only Stanley Cup victory. Despite his holdout, he was named player-coach of the Canadiens in 1915.|$|E
