Calvin's real concern here seems to have been to preserve the reality of the Incarnation, which appeared to him threatened by a view in which even Christ's humanity took on divine infinity and thereby ceased to be really human."

60|$|I breathed more freely. We {{were sitting}} in the rotunda of a famous Washington hotel, and only a few moments before had the speaker, an utter {{stranger}} to me, moved his chair beside mine and opened a conversation. I noticed that he had that timid, lonely, helpless air which invests the bucolic traveler who, for the first time, finds himself among strangers, and his identity lost, in a world so much larger, so much colder, so much more indifferent to him than he ever imagined. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> often attribute to the impertinent familiarity of country-men and rustic travelers on railways or in cities is largely due to their awful loneliness and nostalgia. I remember to have once met in a smoking-car on a Kansas railway one of these lonely ones, who, after plying me with a thousand useless questions, finally elicited the fact that I knew slightly a man who had once dwelt in his native town in Illinois. During the rest of our journey the conversation turned chiefly upon his fellow-townsman, whom it afterwards appeared that my Illinois friend knew no better than I did. But he had established a link between himself and his far-off home through me, and was happy.|$|E

5000|$|When Garner was {{replaced}} {{in his role}} by Paul Bremer on May 11, 2003, {{there was quite a}} bit of speculation as to why he {{was replaced}} so abruptly. It has been suggested that Garner was moved aside because he did not agree with the White House about who should decide how to reconstruct Iraq. He wanted early elections—90 days after the fall of Baghdad—and the new government to decide how to run the country and what to do with its assets. Garner said [...] "I don't think Iraqis need to go by the U.S. plan, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> need to do is set an Iraqi government that represents the freely elected will of the people. It's their country ... their oil." ...|$|E
