5|$|Rain World is a 2017 {{survival}} platformer {{video game}} in which the player controls a part-slug, part-cat creature searching a hostile, derelict world for its family. The Slugcat uses debris as weapons to escape randomized enemies, forage for food, and reach safe hibernation rooms before a deadly torrential rain arrives. The player is given little explicit guidance on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>survive,</b> which was {{the intention of the}} developers, who wanted players to feel like a rat living on subway tracks, in which they learn to survive in an environment without grasping its higher-level function. Rain World was developed by Videocult, a small indie team, over six years and published by Adult Swim Games for PlayStation 4 and Windows in March 2017. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its art design and fluid animations, but disliked its brutal difficulty and imprecise controls.|$|E

25|$|ABC {{cemented}} {{its reputation}} as a youth-oriented network in daytime {{with the addition of}} One Life to Live to its schedule, with {{much of the rest of}} its lineup consisting of soap operas like Dark Shadows, sitcom reruns, and game shows packaged by Chuck Barris. One Life to Live replaced the short-lived Baby Game, in a three-way shuffle with Dark Shadows and Dating Game. The network placed the new serial at 3:30 PM EST, against CBS's established hit Edge of Night and the popular NBC game You Don't Say. Despite the tough competition, the intense tone of the plot and strong characters allowed the show to get a leg up on You Don't Say, wearing that game down to the point of its cancellation in September 1969; NBC replaced the Tom Kennedy-hosted game in that time slot with three unsuccessful serials: Bright Promise, Return to Peyton Place, and <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Survive</b> a Marriage.|$|E
