40|$|International audienceMetals are {{released}} in effluents {{of most of}} combustion processes and are under intensive regulations. To improve our knowledge of combustion process and their resulting emission of metal to the atmosphere, we have developed an approach allowing us to distinguish between gaseous and particulate state of the elements emitted. This study {{was conducted on the}} emission of volatile metallic species emitted from a coal combustion plant where low/medium volatile coal (high-grade ash) was burnt. The occurrence of volatile metal species emission was investigated by cryofocusing sampling procedure and detection using low-temperature packed-column gas chromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry as multielement detector (LT-GC/ICP-MS). Samples were collected in the stack through the routine <b>heated</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>line</b> of the plant downstream from the electrostatic precipitator. The gaseous samples were trapped with a cryogenic device and analyzed by LT-GC/ICP-MS. During the combustion process, seven volatile metal species were detected: three for Se, one for Sn, two for Hg, and one for Cu. Thermodynamic calculations and experimental metal species spiking experiments suggest that the following volatile metal species are present in the flue gas during the combustion process: COSe, CSSe, CSe 2, SeCl 2, Hg- 0, HgCl 2, CuO-CuSO 4 or CuSO 4. H 2 O, and SnO 2 or SnCl 2. The quantification of volatile species was compared to results traditionally obtained by standardized impinger-based sampling and analysis techniques recommended for flue gas combustion characterization. Results showed that concentrations obtained with the standard impinger approach are at least 10 times higher than obtained with cryogenic sampling, suggesting the trapping microaerosols in the traditional methods. Total metal concentrations in particles are also reported and discussed...|$|E
40|$|On-line {{systems for}} {{monitoring}} mercury in liquid and gaseous production and waste streams have been developed, utilising atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS) {{as the basis}} for detection. Instrumentation has been designed for unattended continuous operation. Laboratory chemistries for the vapour generation of mercury, normally performed off-line in batch mode, have been adapted and optimised for continuous, flow-injection analysis for varying sample types and chemical forms of mercury. The system has typical analysis cycle of 7 minutes, a limit of detection of 10 pg ml ˉ¹ a linear range up to 100 µg ml ˉ¹ and has been applied in industrial environments for the continuous monitoring of mercury in incineration wastewater and sulphuric acid. The system was validated by on-site trials for periods of one week, during which time comparative off-line laboratory measurements showed good agreement. An automated system for monitoring mercury in natural gas streams has also been developed and validated by laboratory and on-site industrial trials. A heated pressure let-down system was designed in order to facilitate sampling of high-pressure gas streams without condensation of heavier fractions. The <b>heated</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>line</b> was interfaced with an automated system for trapping mercury, from variable volumes of gas, onto gold amalgamation traps, with subsequent desorbtion and analysis by AFS. The method detection limit for a 58 litre sample of natural gas was 30 pg m ˉ³ which was sufficient to determine residual mercury in natural gas streams even after mercury scrubbing had been performed. The system was validated by laboratory trials and spiking experiments during on-site trials at a gas processing facility, which resulted in complete installation and commissioning. P. S.

40|$|A compact, fast-response Quantum Cascade Tunable Infrared Laser Differential Absorption Spectrometer (QC-TILDAS) for {{measurements}} of ammonia (NH 3 ) has been evaluated under both laboratory and field conditions. Absorption of radiation from a pulsed, thermoelectrically cooled QC laser occurs at reduced pressure in a 0. 5 L multiple pass absorption cell with an effective path length of 76 m. Detection is achieved using a thermoelectrically-cooled Mercury Cadmium Telluride (HgCdTe) infrared detector. A novel sampling inlet was used, {{consisting of a}} short, heated, quartz tube with a hydrophobic coating to minimize the adsorption of NH 3 to surfaces. The inlet contains a critical orifice that reduces the pressure, a virtual impactor for separation of particles, and additional ports for delivering NH 3 -free background air and calibration gas standards. The level of noise in this instrument {{has been found to}} be 0. 23 ppb at 1 Hz. The sampling technique has been compared to the results of a conventional lead salt Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectrometer (TDLAS) during a laboratory intercomparison. The effect of humidity and heat on the surface interaction of NH 3 with sample tubing was investigated at mixing ratios ranging from 30 – 1000 ppb. Humidity was seen to worsen the NH 3 time response and considerable improvement was observed when using a <b>heated</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>line.</b> A field intercomparison of the QC-TILDAS with a modified Thermo 42 CTL chemiluminescence-based analyzer was also performed at Environment Canada's Centre for Atmospheric Research Experiments (CARE) in the rural town of Egbert, ON between May–July 2008. Background tests and calibrations using two different permeation tube sources and an NH 3 gas cylinder were regularly carried out throughout the study. Results indicate a very good correlation at 1 min time resolution (R 2 = 0. 93) between the two instruments at the beginning of the study, when regular background subtraction was applied to the QC-TILDAS. An overall good correlation of R 2 = 0. 85 was obtained over the entire two month data set, where the majority of the spread can be attributed to differences in inlet design and background subtraction methods...|$|E

Because the number concentration of nano-sized particles emitted by automotive engine, that are suspected of being hazardous to human health and environment, might increase with engine fuel considerably and recently attracted attention. So a ultra-low sulfur diesel(ULSD), BD 100 (100 % bio-diesel) and Di-Methyl Ether(DME) fuels used for this study.

40|$|Methyl esters of soybean oil, {{known as}} biodiesel, are {{receiving}} increasing attention {{as an alternative}} fuel for diesel engines. Biodiesel is a nontoxic, biodegradable, and renewable fuel {{with the potential to}} reduce engine exhaust emissions. However, previous results have shown that biodiesel produces a higher fraction of soluble organic material (SOF) in the exhaust particulate matter than petroleum-based diesel fuel although its total particulate emissions were lowered. Also, because biodiesel has a high boiling point and low volatility compared with diesel fuel, its unburned hydrocarbon vapor could be lost by deposition in the hydrocarbon <b>sampling</b> <b>line.</b> This loss could be the source of reported reductions in hydrocarbon emissions from biodiesel-fueled engines. No information about whether the typical measurement temperature for unburned hydrocarbons is suitable for biodiesel hydrocarbon measurement is available. In this project, the formation of SOF in diesel exhaust particulates and the deposition of hydrocarbons in <b>heated</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>lines</b> were studied experimentally and theoretically;The experimental results showed that biodiesel produced a higher SOF fraction in its total particulates than diesel fuel under virtually all engine operating conditions. The SOF fraction decreased with increasing filter temperature at constant dilution ratio and with increasing dilution ratio at constant filter temperature. Biodiesel injection tests, where a small quantity of neat biodiesel was injected into the exhaust gas showed that most of the unburned biodiesel showed up in the soluble organic fraction of the collected particulates. The response of the heated flame ionization detector did not match the concentration change of unburned biodiesel in the exhaust gas. Based on the predicted results from condensation and multicomponent adsorption models, adsorption of vapor phase hydrocarbons on the carbon particle surface is the primary source of the SOF in the total particulate matter. The condensation process, by itself, cannot explain the formation of SOF during the dilution process. Adsorption of hydrocarbons is also shown to take place during transport of the hydrocarbon sample, even at high temperature. At the standard hydrocarbon measurement temperature, adsorption onto the <b>sampling</b> <b>line</b> walls could affect the concentration of unburned hydrocarbons and biodiesel in the exhaust gas sample. However, when the hydrocarbon <b>sampling</b> <b>line</b> temperature was <b>heated</b> to 250 °C, adsorption did not show significant effect on reducing the hydrocarbon concentration in the exhaust sample...|$|R
40|$|A cone {{calorimeter}} {{with air}} supply box {{around the fire}} test zone was shown to reproduce all the classic features of compartment fires and hence could {{provide a basis for}} the determination of toxic gases emitted from materials in fires, under realistic test conditions. Direct hot exhaust gas sampling was used from a small chimney attached to the cone heater outlet and <b>heated</b> <b>sample</b> <b>lines,</b> pumps and filters were used to transport the <b>sample</b> to a <b>heated</b> Temet FTIR, calibrated for all the toxic gases of interest in fire toxicity. Three aircraft seat material were tested, two seat covers of fabric and leather and the seat foam. All the materials were from commercial suppliers to the aircraft industry. Ventilation conditions in the fires were typical of those on aircraft at 9 - 15 ACH. All three material samples had S and N in their composition, the S from the fire retardants and N from the use of an acrylic fibre in the seat covers and of PUF in the seat foam. As a consequence SO₂ and HCN were major toxic species in all the material fires. In all the fires HF was detected and for the foam and the leather seat cover HCl was detected and these indicate the presence of halogen based fire retardants in the material composition. Thus, most of the toxic gases measured were due to the presence of S, N, F and Cl in the material composition. Other toxic gases detected were the more conventional fire toxic gases CO, formaldehyde, acrolein and benzene. Only in the fabric fire was NO₂ significant. The peak toxicity occurred in the initial flaming combustion and the toxicity order was leather > fabric > foam on both an LC₅₀ and COSHH 15 min toxic assessment basis. Both toxic assessment methods showed the same group of toxic gases were important and only their relative importance changed between the toxic assessment methods. It was concluded that toxic gas assessment should be added to current material test programmes on fire behavior and that the cone calorimeter, modified as in the present work, was a good basis for the toxic gas measurements...|$|R

The rig is a stable gas turbine combustor simulator providing particles of physicochemical properties analogous to real aircraft engines. The rig ran at three operating conditions, giving a range of organic to elemental carbon distributions, allowing different aerosol compositions to be formed for comparison and analysis of transport losses.

AramouniOhmic heating for {{the food}} {{industry}} consists of using electrical energy to heat foods {{as a method of}} preservation, which can in turn be used for microbial inactivation or several other processes such as pasteurization, extraction, dehydration, blanching or thawing. Few studies have been conducted on the usefulness of this environmentally friendly processing technique. Due to the lack of sufficient information on research into ohmic heating {{for the food}} industry, a few of the published studies are discussed here in detail. This report also focuses on self-conducted research using ohmic heating to determine its effect on Lactobacillus acidophilus inactivation versus conventional heating. Lactobacillus acidophilus was inoculated into MRS broth and incubated for 24 hours. The sample was then inoculated into sterile buffer at a dilution rate of 1 : 100. Samples of the diluted culture were subjected to either low voltage (18 V) or conventional heating (300 °C) over a hotplate stirrer. Temperature was monitored on test and control samples to achieve an endpoint of 90 °C. Samples were taken at regular intervals, plated onto MRS agar and incubated for 72 hours at 35 °C to compare plate count expressed as colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/mL). Temperature was uniform throughout the ohmically <b>heated</b> <b>sample</b> and reached the endpoint more quickly than the conventionally <b>heated</b> <b>sample,</b> which also had cold spots. The total plate count {{at the end of the}} experiment was less for the ohmically <b>heated</b> <b>sample</b> versus the conventionally <b>heated</b> <b>sample.</b> Ohmic <b>heating</b> was more effective in inactivation of Lactobacillus acidophilus than conventional heating, most likely due to the more rapid and uniform <b>heating</b> of the <b>sample,</b> and possible electroporation of the cells...|$|R
