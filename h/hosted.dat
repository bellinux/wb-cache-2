25|$|The {{life-cycle}} of {{a typical}} member of this genus involves two <b>host</b> species, a definitive <b>host</b> and an intermediate <b>host.</b> Often the definitive <b>host</b> is a predator and the intermediate <b>host</b> is its prey.

When the intermediate <b>host</b> is eaten by the definitive <b>host,</b> the cycle is completed.

40|$|Most herbivorous {{arthropods}} are <b>host</b> {{specialists and}} the question is which mechanisms drive the evolution of such specialization. The theory of antagonistic pleiotropy suggests that there is a trade-off between adaptation of herbivores to a novel <b>host</b> and their native <b>host.</b> The mutation accumulation hypothesis proposes that herbivores on a novel <b>host</b> lose their adaptation to the native <b>host</b> through the accumulation of mutations with negligible effects on performance on the novel <b>host.</b> Experimental evidence for either of the two hypotheses is scarce. We compared the fitness of two sympatric moth strains from an introduced <b>host</b> and a native <b>host.</b> The strain from the novel <b>host</b> did not perform better on this <b>host</b> than the strain from the native <b>host.</b> The strain from the novel <b>host</b> performed less well on the native <b>host</b> than did the strain from the native <b>host.</b> Hence, selection on the novel <b>host</b> did not result in noticeable gain in performance, but adaptation to the native <b>host</b> was lost. These results are more readily explained by the mutation-accumulation hypothesis than by the trade-off hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|Obligate avian brood parasites show {{dramatic}} {{variation in}} {{the degree to which}} they are <b>host</b> specialists or <b>host</b> generalists. The screaming cowbird Molothrus rufoaxillaris is one of the most specialized brood parasites, using a single <b>host,</b> the bay-winged cowbird (Agelaioides badius) over most of its range. Coevolutionary theory predicts increasing <b>host</b> specificity the longer the parasite interacts with a particular avian community, as <b>hosts</b> evolve defences that the parasite cannot counteract. According to this view, <b>host</b> specificity can be maintained if screaming cowbirds avoid parasitizing potentially suitable <b>hosts</b> that have developed effective defences against parasitic females or eggs. Specialization may also be favoured, even in the absence of <b>host</b> defences, if the parasite's reproductive success in alternative <b>hosts</b> is lower than that in the main <b>host.</b> We experimentally tested these hypotheses using as alternative <b>hosts</b> two suitable but unparasitized species: house wrens (Troglodytes aedon) and chalk-browed mockingbirds (Mimus saturninus). We assessed <b>host</b> defences against parasitic females and eggs, and reproductive success of the parasite in current and alternative <b>hosts.</b> Alternative <b>hosts</b> did not discriminate against screaming cowbird females or eggs. Egg survival and hatching success were similarly high in current and alternative <b>hosts,</b> but the survival of parasitic chicks was significantly lower in alternative <b>hosts.</b> Our results indicate that screaming cowbirds have the potential to colonize novel <b>hosts,</b> but higher reproductive success in the current <b>host</b> may favour <b>host</b> fidelity...|$|R
