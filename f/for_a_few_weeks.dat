5|$|Tentative {{evidence}} supports 3,4-diaminopyridine] at least <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b> The 3,4-diaminopyridine base or the water-soluble 3,4-diaminopyridine phosphate may be used. Both 3,4-diaminopyridine formulations delay the repolarization of nerve terminals after a discharge, thereby allowing more calcium to accumulate in the nerve terminal.|$|E

5|$|The new Congress met <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> in March 1867, then adjourned, {{leaving the}} House Committee on the Judiciary behind, charged with {{reporting}} {{back to the}} full House whether there were grounds for Johnson to be impeached. This committee duly met, examined the President's bank accounts, and summoned members of the Cabinet to testify.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{remained}} in Washington <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> after Congress adjourned. Having learned that John Archibald Campbell, an Alabaman {{serving on the}} Supreme Court, had decided to resign {{in light of his}} state's secession, President Lincoln proposed to appoint Crittenden to the vacant seat. Lincoln's cabinet approved, and the nomination papers were drafted, but Campbell belatedly reconsidered his resignation, {{and by the time he}} definitely determined to resign, Lincoln had changed his mind regarding Crittenden's nomination.|$|E
5|$|Lee (Rosemarie DeWitt), a yoga instructor, {{brings her}} husband Tim (Jake Johnson), a gym teacher, and their 3-year-old son Jude (Jude Swanberg) to house-sit in a client's house <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> while {{the client is}} away. While walking around the property, Tim finds a gun and a bone in the backyard.

5|$|They're coming! Who? Why, Tintin and Snowy, of course! Perhaps, {{since you}} have not heard {{anything}} about them lately, you have been afraid, dear readers, that something bad had happened to them? Nothing of the sort! Tintin and Snowy were simply waiting for our excellent associate and friend Hergé to return to better health, as he was sick <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} Kantakouzenos {{received}} grave news from Constantinople. In late August Apokaukos attempted a coup {{and tried to}} kidnap John V. Having failed, he fled to his fortified house at Epibatai, where he was blockaded by troops. Kantakouzenos returned to Constantinople in early September, where he stayed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> consulting with the Empress. On {{his way back to}} Thrace to prepare for a campaign into the Morea, he went to Epibatai, where he pardoned Apokaukos and restored him to his former offices.|$|E
5|$|Deep Purple was {{practically}} {{ignored by the}} music press in the US upon its release in June 1969 and bounced {{up and down on}} the Billboard 200 chart <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> peaking at No. 162 and not coming close to the success of its two predecessors. Tetragrammaton's financial problems were partially to blame, as promotion was lackluster, but the lack of a hit single to be aired on FM radio or a tour in support of the album were also important factors.|$|E
50|$|TV3 in New Zealand {{picked up}} the series <b>for</b> just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> in 1996 but then later cancelled, the show which {{featured}} former Shortland Street actor Martin Henderson.|$|R
5000|$|Jack [...] "Haigho" [...] Smith, 1955; {{his term}} lasted <b>for</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> before his death, having {{previously}} given devoted service as Honorary Secretary {{for more than}} 30 years.|$|R
2500|$|Minutemen toured frequently, {{but usually}} <b>for</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> at <b>a</b> time – they all held down day jobs. Their [...] "econo" [...] {{practices}} helped {{ensure that their}} tours were generally profitable.|$|R
5|$|During the War of 1812, {{during the}} summer of 1812 or 1813, Alder was elected captain of a company of 70 men formed in Plain City. With Frederick Loyd as his lieutenant, Alder's company was ordered by the Governor to march about twenty miles north and build a {{blockhouse}} at Mill Creek, about three miles north of Marysville, Ohio, to protect the Darby settlements. The company built and garrisoned the blockhouse <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> but when a false alarm was sounded regarding Indians attacking the settlements, the men returned to their homes. This was the only fort ever constructed in Union County, and some of the foundation is still visible today.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{fought in}} the Raid on St Malo in June 1758. The British landed near St Malo, at first {{planning}} to attack the town. However, they decided to destroy shipping first and attack the town later. Finding that to occupy the town would require a full siege, for which they had insufficient troops, they occupied St Servan, where they burned over one hundred vessels including thirty privateers. British ships retreated after seeing a large French force, but sailed around the coast <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> seeking another place to attack. Even though the Raid on St Malo was small and little damage was done, it is considered a British victory.|$|E
5|$|Heaphy {{painted a}} variety of {{subjects}} including landscapes, flora and fauna and notable Māori, including the chieftain Te Rauparaha. The success of the company depended on attracting emigrants to New Zealand so his work was almost always intended to present the country and its inhabitants in its best light. Heaphy was at times exposed to some danger; on an expedition to the Chatham Islands, his party intervened in a skirmish between two warring tribes and he {{was wounded in the}} leg. It was unlikely to have been a serious wound <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> later, he went on a trek back in New Zealand to the Taranaki Region, where he produced some of his more notable landscapes.|$|E
50|$|In {{his first}} 12 {{years as a}} pro, Eschauer found little success, winning just 7 ATP-level matches and {{cracking}} the top-100 <b>for</b> just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> in late 2003, peaking at No. 96.|$|R

5|$|In 2012 the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the UK banned some of Proactiv's {{advertising}} as misleading. A viewer {{complained that}} the celebrities were likely to have used the US version of Proactiv, which differs from the UK version. According to the ASA, the celebrities had signed statements saying they had used the UK version <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> one to three years earlier, but the advertisements gave the appearance that they had continued to benefit from it, so the viewer's complaint was upheld.|$|E
5|$|In March 1939, Wilcke {{volunteered for}} service with the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> he flew with 1. Staffel (1st squadron) of Jagdgruppe 88 (J/88—88th Fighter Group) without {{claiming}} any aerial victories. He {{was awarded the}} Spanish Cross in Bronze with Swords for his service in Spain. In Spain he became friends with Werner Mölders and when Mölders was appointed Gruppenkommandeur (group commander) of the newly created III. Gruppe of JG53, he selected Wilcke as Staffelkapitän (squadron leader) of the 7. Staffel (7th squadron) of JG53.|$|E
5|$|In benign infections {{found in}} some wild and captive African elephants, these viruses can affect either the skin or the {{pulmonary}} system. In the former case, it produces small pinkish nodules {{on the head and}} trunk in juveniles, which appear <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> and then regress, suggesting an intermittently reactivated localized infection that mostly remains dormant. In the second case, it has been found in small white pulmonary nodules on necropsy of many asymptomatic adults. These are both characteristic of EEHV2, EEHV3 and EEHV6.|$|E

50|$|He nursed {{her back}} to health and named her Uce for the laboured sound she made while gasping <b>for</b> breath. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> later he was given another sick {{orangutan}} to look after, which he named Dodoy.|$|R
5|$|Johnson proclaimed {{amnesty for}} all former Confederates on December 25, 1868. Still in Canada, Breckinridge lingered <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> to receive {{assurance}} {{that it still}} applied to him {{even though he had}} not been in the U.S. when it was issued. Departing Canada on February 10, 1869, he made several stops to visit family and friends along the route to Lexington, where he arrived on March 9. Although he resided in Kentucky {{for the rest of his}} life, he never bought a home there after the war, living first in hotels and then renting a home on West Second Street.|$|E
5|$|Müncheberg, who was talented {{in sports}} and athletics, played {{football}} for the T.V. Falkenburg youth team in the early 1930s. He attended the Sturmabteilung-sports school in Hammerstein <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> in 1934 and in 1935 spent his summer vacation in Bulgaria where he, among other places, stayed at the Rila Monastery. In early 1936 he attended a National Socialism course in Lauenburg, Pomerania. He completed his compulsory labour service (Reichsarbeitsdienst) in October 1936 with Abteilung (department) 5/50 in Lüttmannshagen, district of Cammin. As an athlete, he especially excelled in the decathlon; almost daily he practised the ten different disciplines. Aged 17, he attended a summer camp held {{in conjunction with the}} 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the {{benefits}} of more defensible forts are evident: they could act as temporary refuges for overwhelmed local troops during barbarian incursions, while they waited for reinforcements. The forts were difficult for the barbarians to take by assault, as they generally lacked the necessary equipment. The forts could store sufficient supplies to enable the defenders to hold out <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> and to supply relieving troops. They could also act as bases from which defenders could make sorties against isolated groups of barbarians and to cooperate with relieving forces.|$|E
50|$|He joined Conference Premier club Ebbsfleet United in July 2008. In August 2010 it was {{reported}} that he was on trial with English Football League club Stockport County, before re-signing <b>for</b> Ebbsfleet <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> into the season.|$|R
