40|$|Introduction: Human {{leukocyte}} antigen B 27 (HLA-B 27) {{is considered}} as {{a risk factor for}} development of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the prevalence of HLA-B 27 antigen in JIA categories and its influence on disease onset and response to conventional therapy. Material and methods : The retrospective analysis included 461 unselected children with JIA hospitalized in a single reference rheumatology centre between July 2007 and June 2012. The diagnosis was based on criteria by the International League of Association for Rheumatology. HLA-B 27 was determined in 387 of all patients (84 %) by hybridization of the amplified, labelled product to immobilize it on the microarray probe. Results: HLA-B 27 antigen was found in 104 of 383 affected children (27. 2 %), 48 of 206 girls (23. 3 %), and 56 of 177 boys (31. 6 %) – most frequently in patients with <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> (71 %), psoriatic arthritis (50 %) and unclassified cases (86. 7 %). The age of JIA onset was slightly (by 1 year) but significantly different in patients with and without HLA-B 27 antigen [11 (8. 5 – 14) vs. 10 (5 – 13. 5) years.; p < 0. 001]. The use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and corticosteroids was more frequently clinically ineffective in HLA-B 27 positive than negative patients (23. 1 % vs. 15. 2 %; p = 0. 09). Patients with polyarthritis, systemic, and psoriatic arthritis more frequently received biological therapy. HLA-B 27 positive patients with <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> received biological therapy more frequently than HLA-B 27 negative ones (20. 4 % vs. 0, respectively; p = 0. 09). Conclusions : HLA-B 27 antigen is a strong risk factor for the development of <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis,</b> and to a lesser extent for psoriatic arthritis and extended course of oligoarthritis. The presence of this antigen does not affect the disease onset but seems to predict resistance to therapy with disease-modifying drugs and corticosteroids...|$|E

40|$|Background: Juvenile {{idiopathic}} arthritis (JIA) is a heterogenic {{group of}} chronic inflammatory connective tissue diseases of unknown aetiology in children up to 16 years of age. Aim: The {{aim of this}} study was to analyse the incidence, clinical presentation and laboratory findings in children with JIA in Malopolska region. Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis included all children with JIA (N= 251) hospitalized in the two reference rheumatology centres covering Malopolska region (Poland), between July 2007 and December 2010. Results: The annual incidence of JIA in Malopolska region was estimated at 9. 5 per 100 000 children. Oligoarthritis (54. 9 %) was the most common category in all age groups with a tendency to decrease with age; from 71. 4 % in children aged 1 - 6 years; 55. 7 % in aged 7 - 12 years to 39. 3 % in aged 13 - 16 years. The frequency of polyarthritis and <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> was greater in adolescents (29. 2 % and 22. 5 %, respectively).

Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study is to describe disease characteristics, disease course, and functional disability in two tertiary centres in the Western Cape, South Africa and compare the findings to other JIA populations. Methods Eighty-six children were recruited during random clinic visits to rheumatology clinics at Tygerberg and Groote Schuur Hospital between April 2010 and April 2011. Children were diagnosed using International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) 2001 classification criteria. Consent was obtained and medical records examined.

40|$|Objective: The {{incidence}} and prevalence of {{juvenile idiopathic arthritis}} (JIA) vary widely across the world but data in East Asia is lacking. Uveitis is a serious cause of morbidity in JIA. This study aimed to analyze the {{incidence and}} prevalence of JIA, and the characteristics of JIA-associated uveitis in Taiwan. Methods: A population-based cohort study was conducted using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Each patient was individually tracked from 1999 to 2009 to identify the diagnosis of JIA and uveitis using the International Classification of Diseases diagnostic codes. Multivariate logistic regression {{was used to determine}} the risk factors and complications of uveitis in patients with JIA. Results: The study cohort had 2636 cases of JIA and included juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (57. 7 %), <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> (ERA) (39. 2 %), and psoriatic arthritis (3. 1 %). The average annual incidence of JIA and JIA-associated uveitis were 4. 93 (range, 3. 93 – 6. 23) and 0. 25 (range, 0. 12 – 0. 37) cases per 100, 000 population, respectively. The average period prevalence of JIA was 33. 8 cases per 100, 000 population.

40|$|Juvenile {{idiopathic}} arthritis (JIA) is {{the most}} common rheumatic disease in childhood. <b>Enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> (ERA) is one of the seven JIA subtypes classified by the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR). Due to inclusion and exclusion criteria, a pitfall of the ERA category {{is that it does not}} include all subsets of juvenile spondyloarthropathy, with many children ending up in the undifferentiated category. The ERA nomenclature also does not have a method for distinguishing between axial and peripheral disease, two phenotypes which vary in presentation and treatment requirements. This distinction is very important given the overall poor prognosis seen in ERA patients, specifically in those with axial involvement. Since axial involvement is more common and presents earlier than previously thought in ERA, the pediatric rheumatology community should develop more accurate and sensitive classification criteria based on disease course to assist in improving timely diagnosis and appropriate management...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of long-term outcome of functional disability and disease activeness in adult patients with {{juvenile idiopathic arthritis}} appears to be complicated due {{to the absence of}} a unified approach to the classification and estimation of disease activeness, as well as the loss of supervision over a patient because of remission or his/her transition from pediatric to adult rheumatic service.  The objective of the research was to determine how adults with the history of juvenile idiopathic arthritis fulfill the classification criteria for adult rheumatic diseases, as well as to assess activeness of these diseases, the degree of functional disorders, and social activeness of patients in Ukraine.  Materials and methods.  Patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis older than 18 years and with more than 3 years of disease duration living in different parts of Ukraine were included into the study. Data regarding sociodemographic features, fulfillment of adult classification criteria, Health Assessment Questionnaire, articular and extra-articular Juvenile Arthritis Damage Index and disease activity were analyzed. Results.  We observed 122 adult patients with the history of juvenile idiopathic arthritis irrespective of the presence of active inflammation at the moment of the examination. This group included patients from different regions of Ukraine diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis during 1984 - 2013. An adult rheumatologist examined all patients and the diagnosis was revised according to the adult classification of rheumatic diseases. Typical diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis were estimated in 32. 8 % of patients, ankylosing spondylitis – in 31. 1 % of patients, undifferentiated arthritis – in 13. 9 % of patients, Still’s disease – in 4. 9 % of patients, psoriatic arthritis – in 0. 8 % of patients, steady clinical laboratory remission – in 16. 5 % of patients. Most patients (81. 8 %) with rheumatoid factor positive polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis fell under rheumatoid arthritis criteria in adulthood, and in 85 % of patients with <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> as well as 53. 8 % of patients with extended oligoarthritis ankylosing spondylitis developed in adulthood. 68. 8 % of patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, 68 % of patients with rheumatoid factor negative polyarthritic subtype and 55 % of patients with <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> had disability and incapacitation. Minimal disorders of the patients’ general condition according to the Health Assessment Questionnaire in adult age were found in most subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis classified according to the International League of Associations for Rheumatology (extended and persistent oligoarthritis, rheumatoid factor positive polyarthritis, systemic subtype); moderate disorders of the general condition were found in <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> and rheumatoid factor negative polyarthritis. Side effects of juvenile idiopathic arthritis according to the articular Juvenile Arthritis Damage Index included severe articular damage being most frequently found in systemic and rheumatoid factor positive polyarthritis subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, while side effects of juvenile idiopathic arthritis according to the extra-articular Juvenile Arthritis Damage Index included extra-articular damage being found in systemic and rheumatoid factor negative polyarthritis subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, that was confirmed by the {{assessment of}} physical health according to the Short Form Health Survey- 36, which was the worst in patients with systemic (40. 3 ± 12. 6) and rheumatoid factor negative polyarthritis (38. 9 ± 9. 4) subtypes of juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

40|$|Objective: Dyslipidemia {{with higher}} {{inflammatory}} states, disease activity, and longer disease duration in {{juvenile idiopathic arthritis}} (JIA) patients seemed to increase the risks of atherosclerosis. Tumor necrosis factor- a (TNF-a) receptor blocking agent etanercept has been proven {{to be effective in}} JIA. However, data about the correlation of anti-inflammatory treatment on lipid profiles and atherogenic index in JIA patients remains limited. This study aimed to investigate the longitudinal changes on lipid profiles and atherogenic index in JIA patients after etanercept treatment. Methods: Twenty-three patients diagnosed with JIA (polyarticular type n = 7; oligoarticular type, n = 2; systemic type, n = 10, <b>Enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> = 4) received treatment with etanercept during the period 2004 – 012 in a medical center. We measured their serum lipid profiles at baseline and 2, 4, 6, 12 months later, and determined whether there were differences in complete blood counts, inflammatory mediators, lipid levels and atherogenic indices between patients who had inactive disease (responders) and those who were poor responders (non-responders) to etanercept treatment. Results: Analysis of dynamic change in total JIA patients before and after TNF inhibitor therapy showed modest increases in hemoglobin levels (P = 0. 02) and decreases in WBC counts, Platelet and CRP levels progressively (p = 0. 002, p = 0. 006 and p = 0. 006, respectively).

40|$|Juvenile {{idiopathic}} arthritis (JIA) is {{a common}} autoimmune disease characterized by environmental influences along with several predisposing genes in the pathogenesis. The protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor 22 (PTPN 22) and signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 4 (STAT 4) have been recognized as susceptibility genes for numerous autoimmune diseases. Associations of STAT 4 rs 7574865 G/T and PTPN 22 (rs 2488457 G/C and rs 2476601 C/T) polymorphisms with JIA have repeatedly been replicated in several Caucasian populations. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the influence of three polymorphisms mentioned above on the risk of developing JIA in Han Chinese patients. Genotyping was performed on a total of 137 Chinese patients with JIA (JIA group) and 150 sex and age frequency-matched healthy volunteers (Control group). The single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were determined by using direct sequencing of PCR-amplified products. There were significant differences of PTPN 22 rs 2488457 G/C and STAT 4 rs 7574865 G/T polymorphisms between both groups. However, no significant difference was observed in distribution frequencies of PTPN 22 rs 2476601 polymorphism.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} suggesting that juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) shares many susceptibility loci with other autoimmune diseases. OBJECTIVE: To investigate variants robustly associated with type 1 diabetes (T 1 D) or coeliac disease (CD) for association with JIA. METHODS: Sixteen single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) already identified as susceptibility loci for T 1 D/CD were selected for genotyping in patients with JIA (n= 1054) and healthy controls (n= 3129). Genotype and allele frequencies were compared using the Cochrane-Armitage trend test implemented in PLINK. RESULTS: One SNP in the LPP gene, rs 1464510, showed significant association with JIA (p(trend) = 0. 002, OR= 1. 18, 95 % CI 1. 06 to 1. 30). A second SNP, rs 653178 in ATXN 2, also showed nominal evidence for association with JIA (p(trend) = 0. 02, OR= 1. 13, 95 % CI 1. 02 to 1. 25). The SNP, rs 17810546, in IL 12 A showed subtype-specific association with <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> (ERA) subtype (p(trend) = 0. 005, OR= 1. 88, 95 % CI 1. 2 to 2. 94). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for a novel JIA susceptibility locus, LPP, is presented. Association at the SH 2 B 3 /ATXN 2 locus, previously reported {{to be associated with}} JIA in a US series, also supports this region as contributing to JIA susceptibility. In addition, a subtype-specific association of IL 12 A with ERA is identified. All findings will require validation in independent JIA cohorts...|$|E

To {{describe}} and profile abnormalities of the lumbar spine in {{a cohort of}} patients with <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> (ERA) as compared to a control group of adolescents with mechanical back pain. Methods. We performed a retrospective review of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lumbar spine scans of 79 patients (58 cases, 21 controls). The study was covered by institutional review board approval and {{informed consent was obtained}} for review of all clinical investigations. Images were reviewed by an expert MRI reader who was blinded to clinical details. The presence or absence of morphologic features of enthesitis, apophyseal joint synovitis, and inflammation of posterior elements was assessed at each lumbar vertebral level. The apophyseal joint inflammation was graded from 0 to 3 using a grading system that was adapted from one used in adults with inflammatory facet osteoarthropathy. STATA software was used for data analysis. Results. One or more abnormalities of the lumbar spine were found in 39 (67 %) of 58 cases and sacroiliitis was present in 45 (78 %) of the cases. Apophyseal joint synovitis was seen in 22 (38 %) cases and in 1 (5 %) control patient. This difference was highly significant (P 0. 004). Inflammatory changes in the interspinous ligaments were seen in a higher percentage of cases than controls and this observation was of statistical significance (P 0. 04). Conclusion.

40|$|Background/PurposeThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{describe}} the clinical features of children affected by juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) under the International League of Associations for Rheumatology-derived classification criteria in a community-based setting. MethodsConsecutive cases of JIA from defined geographic areas of Taiwan were diagnosed and followed in an observational cohort from 1995 to 2010. In addition to the clinical and laboratory data required for the International League of Associations for Rheumatology system, information about the medication and disease activity during the study period was also recorded. ResultsOut of 292 children with chronic joint pain, 195 were diagnosed as JIA: systemic arthritis (19 %), oligoarthritis (persistent 16. 4 %; extended 6. 7 %), polyarthritis rheumatoid factor-negative (11. 8 %), polyarthritis rheumatoid factor-positive (4. 6 %), psoriatic arthritis (1. 5 %), <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> (ERA; 37. 4 %), and undifferentiated arthritis (2. 6 %). Human leukocyte antigen-B 27 was positive in 82. 2 % of patients with ERA. Uveitis was observed in 6. 7 % of patients. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, including biologic medications, were used in 73. 3 % of children during the observational period. At the last follow-up, 40 % of patients experienced a continuously active or relapsing course. ConclusionCompared with previous reports on Western populations, a remarkably high prevalence was found in the ERA of the Chinese cohort, but a relatively low rate of uveitis. Ongoing disease activity was evident in a substantial number of children.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveInitial {{treatment}} of {{juvenile idiopathic arthritis}} (JIA) is largely based {{on the extent of}} joint involvement, disease severity and ILAR category. The licensing of biologic therapies for JIA has expanded treatment options. The aims of the study are (1) to describe treatment prescribing patterns in JIA over the first 3 years following first presentation to paediatric rheumatology and (2) to determine whether patterns of treatment have changed as biologics have become more widely available. MethodsChildren with at least 3 years of follow-up within the Childhood Arthritis Prospective Study (CAPS) were included. For analysis, children were placed into one of five groups according to their initial presentation to paediatric rheumatology: oligoarthritis (oJIA), polyarthritis (pJIA), systemic (sJIA), <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> (ERA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Treatment patterns over 3 years were described. ResultsOf 1051 children, 58 % received synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (sDMARD) and 20 % received biologics over the 3 years. Use of sDMARDs and biologics was higher in more severe disease presentations (sJIA and pJIA); however, 35 % and 10 % who presented with oJIA were also treated with sDMARDs and biologics, respectively. The number of children receiving sDMARD after 2006 was higher (p = 0. 02); however, {{there was no difference in}} biologic prescribing before and after 2006 (p = 0. 4). ConclusionsA high proportion of children presenting with JIA received sDMARDs plus/minus biologics during 3 years of follow-up. This was most common for patients with severe JIA but was also prescribed for patients with oligoarticular disease, despite the lack of evidence for effectiveness in this category...|$|E

OBJECTIVE: Considering the {{relevance}} of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the pathophysiology of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), {{it is likely that}} polymorphisms in its promoter area may be relevant in disease susceptibility and activity. We investigated if clinical measures of JIA activity and TNF-α serum concentrations were associated with TNF-α – 308 genotypes. METHODS: Portuguese patients with JIA in 5 pediatric rheumatology centers were recruited consecutively, along with a control group of healthy subjects. Demographic and clinical data and blood samples were collected from each patient. DNA was extracted for analysis of TNF-α gene promoter polymorphisms at position – 308 by restriction fragment-length polymorphism. RESULTS: One hundred fourteen patients and 117 controls were evaluated; 57 % of patients presented the oligoarticular subtype, 25 % the polyarticular subtype, 8 % the systemic subtype, and 9 % had <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> and 5 % psoriatic arthritis. Twenty-four percent of the patients presented the – 308 GA/AA genotypes and 76 % the – 308 GG genotype, similar to findings in controls. Patients with the – 308 GA/AA genotype had higher degree of functional impairment, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 100 -mm visual analog scale score for disease activity, and TNF-α levels compared to those with the – 308 GG genotype. CONCLUSION: TNF-α – 308 GA/AA genotypes were found to be related to higher inflammatory activity and worse measures of disease activity in Portuguese patients with JIA.

The median duration of remission was 23. 1 months (range: 0 - 69 months). At last follow-up, 103 joints (51 %) of 47 patients were still in remission after a median follow-up time of 28 months (range: 1 - 69 months). For the total cohort, the remission was longer for wrist and finger joints [risk ratio (RR) : 0. 2], with concomitant treatment with methotrexate (RR: 0. 28) and for <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> (RR: 0. 34). For the group of knee joints, remission was longer with concomitant treatment with methotrexate (RR: 0. 37), with triamcinolone hexacetonide (RR: 0. 77) and with general anaesthesia for the procedure (RR: 0. 56). Mild side effects were observed in 45 iaS (22. 3 %), and skin atrophy occurred at the injection site in 2 % of injections, but no major adverse event occurred in our cohort. In conclusion, iaS is a safe procedure with a median duration of remission of 23. 1 months. The remission was longer in the joints of the upper extremity, with concomitant treatment with methotrexate and when the injection was performed under general anaesthesia...|$|E
40|$|We {{wished to}} {{determine}} the prevalence of fever {{as one of the}} first symptoms of the <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> (ERA) subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Also, we wished to ascertain if ERA patients with fever at disease onset differed from those without fever. Consecutive cases of ERA were diagnosed and followed in a retrospective observational study from 1998 to 2013. Information about clinical/laboratory data, medications, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and disease activity during the study period was also recorded. A total of 146 consecutive ERA patients were assessed. Among them, 52 patients (35. 6 %) had fever {{as one of the first}} symptoms at disease onset. Compared with ERA patients without fever at disease onset, patients with fever had significantly more painful joints (3. 5 vs. 2. 8), more swollen joints (1. 1 vs. 0. 8), and more enthesitis (1. 0 vs. 0. 4) (p< 0. 05 for all comparisons). Patients with fever had significantly higher mean values of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, platelet count, and child health assessment questionnaire (CHAQ) scores (40. 8 vs. 26. 4 mm/h; 20. 7 vs. 9. 7 mg/dL; 353. 2 × 109 /L vs. 275. 6 × 109 /L; 1. 0 vs. 0. 8, respectively; all p< 0. 05). During two-year follow-up, CHAQ score, number of flares, as well as the number of patients treated with oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids and combination therapy with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, were significantly higher in ERA patients with fever. Fever was a frequent manifestation of ERA. ERA patients with fever had more active disease at disease onset and poorer outcomes than ERA patients without fever...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. To {{investigate}} the functional status of difficult-to-treat JIA patients, including patients receiving biotherapies, and to correlate functional status to disease activity. Methods. All JIA patients consecutively evaluated in a paediatric rheumatology referral centre (November 2008 to March 2009) {{were enrolled in}} an observational cross-sectional study. The Childhood HAQ (CHAQ), physician's assessment of overall disease activity, parent's assessment of well-being and pain, and active and limited joint numbers were measured. Results. We enrolled 95 patients [27 % systemic, 29 % polyarticular, 22 % <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> (ERA) and 23 % oligoarticular JIA]. Median disease duration was 3. 5 years. Treatment included NSAIDs (56 %), MTX (23 %), CSs (21 %) and biologics (45 %). Of all patients, 31 and 56 %, respectively, had inactive and minimally active disease. The median CHAQ score was 0. 375 (range 0 - 3). Most patients had no or mild functional disability (61 %), impaired well-being (63 %) or pain (55 %); 10 % reported severely impaired function and well-being, 19 % severe pain. ERA patients reported worse well-being and pain. CHAQ scores correlated with disease activity. Long-lasting disease and biologic treatment were associated with better well-being and pain scores. Conclusion. Despite the high proportion of severe JIA patients in this cohort, CHAQ values are within the lower range of recent reports, probably related to new therapeutic approaches. Impaired function and well-being remain a challenge for at least 10 % of the patients. Impaired well-being and pain in ERA patients require further study. The strong correlation between functional status and well-being underlines the importance of improving function to optimize quality of life. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{perform a}} prospective, comprehensive, clinical, and {{radiological}} evaluation of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) involvement {{and its influence}} on craniofacial growth, in a cohort of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), representing all JIA subtypes. METHODS: Clinical rheumatologic and orthodontic evaluations were performed in 100 patients with JIA [12 systemic arthritis, 24 rheumatoid factor (RF) -negative polyarthritis, 1 RF-positive polyarthritis, 39 oligoarthritis, 22 <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis,</b> 2 psoriatic arthritis]. An orthopantomogram and lateral cephalogram were performed in 46 patients. The prevalence of TMJ arthritis was studied in relation to JIA subtype and disease characteristics; cephalometric measurements were compared to those from age- and sex-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: Whereas 55 % of patients with JIA {{had at least one}} symptom/sign of TMJ arthritis, 78 % of the radiographed group exhibited condylar lesions. The presence of condylar damage was not related to clinical orthodontic findings or to JIA subtype, disease activity, severity, or duration. Patients with JIA exhibited larger mandibular plane and A-nasion-B angles, larger total anterior facial height, smaller interincisal and sella-nasion-B angles, and shorter mandibular ramus lengths than their age- and sex-matched controls. Craniofacial alterations were clearly related to the presence of condylar damage, even when present at a minimal degree. CONCLUSION: Our data show that TMJ condylar damage occurs very frequently in JIA, and irrespective of JIA subtype; condylar lesions can present early, progress insidiously, and [...] even at a minimal degree [...] can severely alter the craniofacial profile. We propose that the followup of patients with JIA should include early and regular evaluation by an orthodontist, supplemented with radiographic TMJ imaging. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: Enthesitis is a {{major feature}} of {{juvenile}} idiopathic arthritis (JIA) but is difficult to diagnose clinically. Our objective was to compare the accuracy of ultrasonography with power Doppler (US-PD) versus clinical examination for diagnosing enthesitis in patients with JIA and healthy controls. METHODS: Twenty-six consecutive patients with JIA and 41 healthy volunteers underwent standardized clinical and US-PD examinations of 5 entheseal sites (proximal and distal quadricepital tendon insertions, Achilles tendon, and plantar fascia). US-PD reproducibility was evaluated. US-PD enthesitis {{was defined as a}} PD signal at the enthesis insertion. Bursitis, erosions, and cartilage vascularization were recorded. RESULTS: In the JIA group, 27 (12. 5 %) of the entheseal sites exhibited clinical enthesitis (distal patellar ligament in 45 % of cases) and 20 (9. 4 %) exhibited US-PD enthesitis (distal patellar tendon in 30 %), including 10 clinically normal sites (50 %). US-PD enthesitis was found in several patients with oligoarthritis or polyarthritis. Clinical enthesitis (P < 0. 0001) and HLA-B 27 -positive (P = 0. 05) status were significantly associated with US-PD enthesitis. Erosion and bursitis, but not tendon thickening, were associated with US-PD enthesitis. US-PD enthesitis was not found at any of the 410 entheseal sites in controls; grade 1 cartilage vascularization was noted at 6 % of the control sites. CONCLUSION: Enthesitis is a rare phenomenon in JIA. Clinically silent enthesitis is detected by US-PD and can be found in JIA categories other than <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis.</b> Tendon thickening and cartilage vascularization can be detected in healthy controls. These findings may have implications for patient classification of the use of US-PD...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The spondylarthritides (SpA) are {{strongly}} associated with possession of HLA-B 27. We hypothesized that the expression of abnormal forms of HLA-B 27 in SpA may have a pathogenic role through interaction with cells bearing natural killer (NK) receptors, in particular, killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) KIR 3 DL 2, a receptor for HLA-B 27 homodimer (B 27 (2)). We therefore undertook the present study {{to determine the number}} and function of NK and T cells bearing KIR 3 DL 2 in SpA. METHODS: Expression of KIR 3 DL 2 on NK and T cells was quantified in peripheral blood (PB) from 35 patients with SpA and 5 patients with juvenile <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> (juvenile ERA); samples were compared with samples from healthy and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) controls. Paired synovial fluid (SF) was studied where available. Expression of other KIRs as well as activation, memory, and homing markers on KIR 3 DL 2 + NK and T cells was quantified. NK cell survival was assessed using the apoptotic markers annexin V and 7 -aminoactinomycin D, and cytotoxicity by (51) Cr release assay. RESULTS: In SpA, an increased number of PB and SF NK and CD 4 + T cells expressed the KIR 3 DL 2 receptor compared with controls. In ERA, KIR 3 DL 2 expression was increased in PB and SF CD 4 T cells (and SF NK cells) compared with RA controls. KIR 3 DL 2 + NK cells had an activated phenotype, and were protected from apoptosis by culture with a cell line expressing B 27 (2). SpA PB mononuclear NK cells from SpA patients showed greater cytotoxicity than those from controls. CONCLUSION: KIR 3 DL 2 expression on NK cells and CD 4 lymphocytes is increased in SpA and ERA. These cells are activated and may have a pathogenic role...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the rate of}} temporomandibular joint (TMJ) involvement and find factors associated with TMJ arthritis in a single-center cohort of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all patients with JIA visiting the rheumatology clinic between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2006. Followup information was included until August 2008. A diagnosis of TMJ arthritis was based on clinical rheumatological and/or radiological findings. RESULTS: After a mean followup time for JIA of 4. 6 years (range 0. 08 - 14. 17), 86 / 223 patients (38. 6 %) had developed TMJ arthritis. The rate of TMJ involvement differed significantly among JIA subtypes (p = 0. 0016), with 61 % in extended oligoarticular, 52 % in polyarticular rheumatoid factor (RF) -negative, 50 % in psoriatic, 36 % in systemic, 33 % in polyarticular RF-positive, 33 % in persistent oligoarticular, 30 % in unclassified JIA, and 11 % in <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis.</b> The rate of TMJ involvement in our cohort was statistically significantly lower for patients who were HLA-B 27 -positive (p = 0. 0002). In a multivariate analysis, the association of the following factors was confirmed: JIA subtype (p = 0. 0001), a higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) at diagnosis (p = 0. 0038), involvement of joints of the upper extremity (p = 0. 011), the absence of HLA-B 27 (p = 0. 023), and younger age at onset of JIA (p = 0. 050). CONCLUSION: In our cohort of children with JIA, the overall rate of TMJ involvement was 38. 6 %. Patients with certain JIA subtypes, a higher ESR at disease onset, involvement of upper extremity joints, and younger age at diagnosis {{were more likely to}} develop TMJ arthritis. The presence of HLA-B 27 seemed to be protective...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness and safety of biological agents in children with <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> (ERA). METHODS: All patients with ERA in whom a biological agent was initiated between 1999 and 2010 were selected from the Dutch Arthritis and Biologicals in Children (ABC) register. In this ongoing multicenter observational register, data on {{the course of the}} disease and medication use are retrieved prospectively {{at the start of the}} biological agent, after 3 months, and yearly thereafter. Inactive disease was assessed in accordance with the Wallace criteria. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with ERA started taking 1 or more biological agents: 20 took etanercept, 2 took adalimumab (1 switched from etanercept to adalimumab), and 2 took infliximab (1 switched from etanercept to infliximab). Characteristics: 77 % were male, 77 % had enthesitis, 68 % were HLA-B 27 -positive. The median age of onset was 10. 4 (IQR 9. 4 - 12. 0) years; median followup from the start of the biological agent was 1. 2 (IQR 0. 5 - 2. 4) years. Intention-to-treat analysis shows that inactive disease was achieved in 7 of 22 patients (32 %) after 3 months, 5 of 13 patients (38 %) after 15 months, and 5 of 8 patients (63 %) after 27 months of treatment. Two patients discontinued etanercept because of ineffectiveness, and switched to adalimumab (inactive disease achieved) or infliximab (decline in joints with arthritis after 3 months of treatment). One patient discontinued etanercept because of remission, but had flare and restarted treatment, with good clinical response. No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -blocking agents seem effective and safe for patients with ERA that was previously unresponsive to 1 or more DMARD. However, a sustained disease-free state could not be achieved, and none discontinued TNF-blocking agents successfully...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} etanercept (ETN) in paediatric subjects with extended oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (eoJIA), <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> (ERA), or psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Methods: CLIPPER is an ongoing, Phase 3 b, open-label, multicentre study; the 12 -week (Part 1) data are reported here. Subjects with eoJIA (2 - 17 years), ERA (12 - 17 years), or PsA (12 - 17 years) received ETN 0. 8 mg/kg once weekly (maximum 50 mg). Primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects achieving JIA American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 30 criteria at week 12; secondary outcomes included JIA ACR 50 / 70 / 90 and inactive disease. Results: 122 / 127 (96. 1 %) subjects completed the study (mean age 11. 7 years). JIA ACR 30 (95 % CI) was achieved by 88. 6 % (81. 6 % to 93. 6 %) of subjects overall; 89. 7 % (78. 8 % to 96. 1 %) with eoJIA, 83. 3 % (67. 2 % to 93. 6 %) with ERA and 93. 1 % (77. 2 % to 99. 2 %) with PsA. For eoJIA, ERA, or PsA categories, the ORs of ETN vs the historical placebo data were 26. 2, 15. 1 and 40. 7, respectively. Overall JIA ACR 50, 70, 90 and inactive disease were achieved by 81. 1, 61. 5, 29. 8 and 12. 1 %, respectively. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), infections, and serious AEs, were reported in 45 (35. 4 %), 58 (45. 7 %), and 4 (3. 1 %), subjects, respectively. Serious AEs were one case each of abdominal pain, bronchopneumonia, gastroenteritis and pyelocystitis. One subject reported herpes zoster and another varicella. No differences in safety were observed across the JIA categories. Conclusions: ETN treatment for 12 weeks was effective and well tolerated in paediatric subjects with eoJIA, ERA and PsA, with no unexpected safety findings...|$|E
40|$|Alteration of gut {{microbiota}} {{is involved}} in several chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, and gut microbial pro-arthritogenic profiles have been hypothesized. Intestinal inflammation {{may be involved in}} spondyloarthropathies and in a subset of patients affected by Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), the most common chronic rheumatic disease of childhood. We compared the fecal microbiota composition of JIA patients with healthy subjects (HS), evaluating differences in microbial profiles between sub-categories of JIA, such as <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> (JIA-ERA), in which inflammation of entheses occurs, and polyarticular JIA, non-enthesitis related arthritis (JIA-nERA). Through taxon-level analysis, we discovered alteration of fecal microbiota components that could be involved in subclinical gut inflammation, and promotion of joint inflammation. We observed abundance in Ruminococcaceae in both JIA categories, reduction in Clostridiaceae and Peptostreptococcaceae in JIA-ERA, and increase in Veillonellaceae in JIA-nERA, respectively compared with HS. Among the more relevant genera, we found an increase in Clostridium cluster XIVb, involved in colitis and arthritis, in JIA-ERA patients compared with HS, and a trend of decrease in Faecalibacterium, known for anti-inflammatory properties, in JIA-nERA compared with JIA-ERA and HS. Differential abundant taxa identified JIA patients for the HLA-B 27 allele, including Bilophila, Clostridium cluster XIVb, Oscillibacter and Parvimonas. Prediction analysis of metabolic functions showed that JIA-ERA metagenome was differentially enriched in bacterial functions related to cell motility and chemotaxis, suggesting selection of potential virulence traits. We also discovered differential microbial profiles and intra-group variability among active disease and remission, suggesting instability of microbial ecosystem in autoimmune diseases with respect to healthy status. Similarly to other chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, different microbial profiles, as observed among different JIA subgroups compared to HS, and potential functional acquisition related to migration could promote inflammation and contribute to the disease pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Chemokines and {{chemokine}} receptors play a {{major role}} in homing of cells to the site of inflammation. <b>Enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis</b> (ERA) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis and no data are available on chemokines and their receptors in ERA. Blood (20) and synovial fluid (SF) (11) was collected from patients with ERA, and peripheral blood (PB) was collected from 12 patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), nine patients with systemic onset and 18 healthy controls. Chemokines [interleukin (IL) - 10 /CXCL 10, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC) /CCL 17 and regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) /CCL 5] were measured in serum and SF. Chemokine receptor expression was measured by flow cytometry. There was no difference in blood CD 4 + T cells bearing CCR 5, CCR 4 and CXCR 3 in ERA and healthy controls. In paired samples the median frequency of CCR 5 + CD 4 + T cells was higher in SF compared to PB (15 · 8 versus 3 · 9 %, P < 0 · 005), as was the frequency of CXCR 3 + T cells (21 · 61 % versus 12 · 46 %, P < 0 · 05). Median serum interferon-inducible protein- 10 (IP- 10) /CXCL 10 levels were higher in patients with ERA compared to controls (139 versus 93 pg/ml; P < 0 · 05). Further median SF IP- 10 /CXCL 10 levels were higher than the serum levels (2300 pg/ml versus 139 pg/ml; P < 0 · 01). Serum levels of RANTES/CCL 5 were higher in patients (150 ng/ml) compared to control (99 ng/ml; P < 0 · 01). The SF levels were significantly lower compared to serum (P < 0 · 05). TARC/CCL 17 levels in SF were lower than serum. There is increased homing of CCR 5 and CXCR 3 + CD 4 cells to the SF. Increased SF levels of IP- 10 /CXCL 10 may be responsible for this migration in patients with ERA...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: JIA is {{the most}} common chronic {{inflammatory}} rheumatic disease in childhood. It carries a high risk for life-long morbidity and disability. Longitudinal cost-of-illness studies are crucial, given the availability of new expensive drugs, which may alter the course of disease. The objective was to analyze the societal economic burden of JIA, the share of cost components, the shift of costs over time, as well as the influence of disease-associated and sociodemographic parameters on the costs in newly diagnosed JIA patients in routine paediatric rheumatology care. Methods: All data were collected within the German JIA inception cohort ICON, conducted at 11 paediatric rheumatology sites. Physician, parent questionnaires and cost diaries provided data on patients’ health and sociodemographic status, disease-related resource consumption and families’ out-of-pocket costs. The unit prices for all documented resources were established based on public cost information for 2011. The association between costs and clinical as well as sociodemographic variables were determined by regression analyses. Results: Analyses were based on 333 patients (2 / 3 female, median age: 7 years, median disease duration at baseline: 8 month; 49 % oligoarthritis/ 29 % polyarthritis/ 10 % <b>enthesitis-related</b> <b>arthritis).</b> In the year before enrollment (year of diagnosis) the mean total costs accumulated to 6, 186 euros (SD: 7, 149. 8; Median: 3, 818 euros; IQR: 1, 742 – 7, 644) per patient and year (50 % due to hospitalization, 20 % to indirect costs, 3 % to medication). Within the first complete year of routine paediatric rheumatology care, the mean total costs accumulated to 9, 754 euros (SD: 21, 011. 9; Median 3, 540 euros; IQR: 1, 176 – 12, 056) per patient and year. Now, medication (43 % of total costs) was the main cost factor, mostly due to biologics (in 19 % of all patients). Costs varied widely among patients, being significantly associated with various disease-related and sociodemographic parameters, as JIA subgroup, patient’s disease activity (JADAS), functional status (CHAQ), quality of life (PedsQL) and participating study center. Except for the prevalence of uveitis, all analyzed disease-related parameters improved in mean over time. The mean costs borne by the families amounted to 539 euros (Median: 260 euros) in the year before study enrollment, and 836 euros (Median: 228 euros) {{in the first year of}} follow-up, which corresponded to 1 % and 1. 6 % of the average German families’ net income. Conclusions: JIA imposes a relevant economic burden to society. All costs incurred within the early disease must be considered in the light of upcoming costs and patients’ long-term outcomes...|$|E
