40|$|The tests {{results of}} {{vegetable}} oil bases with viscosity grade VG 46, based on rapeseed oil were presented. The viscosity of vegetable oil has been modified through {{the addition of}} castor oil or synthetic viscosity improvers. The lubricating and physicochemical properties of base oils were investigated. The obtained results were compared {{with the requirements of}} Polish standard PN-C- 96057 - 6 : “Petroleum products- Hydraulic oils for hydrostatic systems-Hydraulic oils L-HV. ” It was stated that vegetable bases exhibit excellent antiscuffing properties. They fulfil the requirements of the standard in the scope of rheological properties, corrosive properties, air release properties, and filtering rate. The elaborated oils have a high flash point. The mixture of rapeseed oil and castor oil has, additionally, high shear resistance and good <b>demulsibility.</b> For these reasons, this mixture was indicated as base oil for the L-HV class of hydraulic oil for agricultural machinery...|$|E
40|$|Sulphonates {{that work}} as {{emulsifiers}} in asphalt emulsification are generated in situ by partial sulphonation of asphalt. More stable emulsions {{can be made}} by using sulphonated asphalt with a conventional emulsifier. To demonstrate, the sodium oleate was used as co-emulsifier. Effect of sulphonation time, temperature, acid concentration and amount of sulphonated asphalt on emulsion properties is studied. Use of 2 (4) factorial design revealed that acid concentration, reaction time and temperature are significantly important parameters. The stability of emulsion increases with increased severity of reaction, that is, higher acid concentration, reaction time and temperature. In the most severe conditions, the asphalt forms coke-like polymerized matter thar is not emulsifiable. The most stable emulsion was prepared with asphalt that was sulphonated at slightly milder conditions, namely, 69 degrees C, 60 minutes and 98 % acid. Storage stability, <b>demulsibility</b> and viscosity improved by 41. 7 %, 46. 8 % and 45. 7 % respectively, with 40 % of sulphonated asphalt...|$|E
