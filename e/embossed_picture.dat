40|$|In {{an attempt}} to find some answers to the needs arising from our {{educational}} practice with blind students, this exploratory study sought to understand the perceptions and the importance that blind students and special education teachers attach to representations of graph-tactile images. It also aimed to know its readability and identification among blind students and the appropriateness of its use in the present educational inclusion context. This kind of recognition implies a haptic perceptible digitality (tactile and kinaesthetic information), of active tact, essential {{to the way they}} prosecute and use figurative information. Based on the observation of six students with blindness (congenital and acquired), on the identification of <b>embossed</b> <b>pictures</b> and on the results of interviews to six special education teachers, it was possible to assume that the graph-tactile representation is important and relevant to the blind student in inclusive educational context. There is however still {{a long way to go}} in the construction and use of materials/embossed pictures to motivate the learning and to promote an environment propitious to inclusion. Na tentativa de se encontrarem algumas respostas para as necessidades decorrentes da nossa prática educativa com alunos cegos, este estudo, de caráter exploratório, teve como principal objetivo conhecer as perceções e a importância que os alunos cegos e os professores de educação especial (EE) atribuem às representações de imagens grafo-táteis. Pretendeu, igualmente, perceber a pertinência da sua utilização no contexto educativo atual de inclusão. Com base na observação de seis alunos com cegueira (congénita e adquirida), na identificação de imagens em relevo e no resultado de entrevistas efetuadas a seis professores de EE, foi possível concluir que a representação grafo-tátil é importante e pertinente para o aluno cego no contexto educativo inclusivo. Contudo, há ainda um longo caminho a percorrer na construção e utilização de materiais/imagens em relevo para motivar a aprendizagem e promover um ambiente facilitador da inclusã...|$|R

40|$|Are dreidels fair? In other words, {{does the}} average dreidel {{have an equal}} chance of turning up any one of its four sides? To explore this hypothesis, three {{different}} dreidels were each spun hundreds of times {{with the number of}} occurrences of each side recorded. It was found that all three dreidels tested [...] a cheap plastic dreidel, an old wooden dreidel, and a dreidel that came <b>embossed</b> with a <b>picture</b> of Santa Claus [...] were not fair. Statistically, for each dreidel, some sides came up significantly more often than others. Although an unfair dreidel does not necessarily make the game itself unfair, it is conjectured that hundreds of pounds of chocolate have been distributed during Chanukah under false pretenses.

5000|$|In {{subsequent}} subsection amendments of the Tokelau Amendment Act 1999, {{issued in}} July 2001 the directive was {{specific to the}} Tokelau (Employer for Tokelau Public Service) Order 2001. Under this amendment {{the powers of the}} New Zealand State Services Commissioner was transferred to the Tokelau Employment Commission to administer the Tokelau Public Service. Since 1994, it has vast self-governing powers, but not the status of an independent country. Two referendums have opposed any change in its present status. Tokelu remains a territory of New Zealand as two referendums held for self-government failed to muster enough support even though the United Nations had urged them to become independent. This vote was in-spite of an assurance that they would retain their New Zealand citizenship and $11 million a year grant would not be withdrawn. Documents of interest during this period include the Tokelau Amendment Act 1996 (Preamble) and the Joint Statement of the Principles of Partnership (2003). The amended acts authorized the specific issue of coins of [...] "Tokelau 2000 Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Commemorative Five Dollars" [...] and gold coins of the [...] "Tokelau 1999 Smallest Gold Coins Commemorative Ten Dollars". The former coin is <b>embossed</b> with <b>picture</b> of His late Majesty King George VI and Her late Majesty the Queen Mother standing to the right acknowledging the greetings of the people assemble below the balcony.

60|$|On {{reaching}} the Academy, the soldier or policeman {{at the entrance}} directed us into the large hall, the walls of which were covered {{on both sides with}} pictures, arranged as nearly as possible in a progressive series, with reference to the date of the painters; so that here the origin and procession of the art may be traced through the course of, at least, two hundred years. Giotto, Cimabue, and others of unfamiliar names to me, are among the earliest; and, except as curiosities, I should never desire to look once at them, nor think of looking twice. They seem to have been executed with great care and conscientiousness, and the heads are often wrought out with minuteness and fidelity, and have so much expression that they tell their own story clearly enough; but it seems not to have been the painter's aim to effect a lifelike illusion, the background and accessories being conventional. The trees are no more like real trees than the feather of a pen, and there is no perspective, the figure of the picture being shadowed forth on a surface of burnished gold. The effect, when these pictures, some of them very large, were new and freshly gilded, must have been exceedingly brilliant, and much resembling, on an immensely larger scale, the rich illuminations in an old monkish missal. In fact, we have not now, in pictorial ornament, anything at all comparable to what their splendor must have been. I was most struck with a picture, by Fabriana Gentile, of the Adoration of the Magi, where the faces and figures {{have a great deal of}} life and action, and even grace, and where the jewelled crowns, the rich embroidered robes, and cloth of gold, and all the magnificence of the three kings, are represented with the vividness of the real thing: a gold sword-hilt, for instance, or a pair of gold spurs, being actually <b>embossed</b> on the <b>picture.</b> The effect is very powerful, and though produced in what modern painters would pronounce an unjustifiable way, there is yet pictorial art enough to reconcile it to the spectator's mind. Certainly, the people of the Middle Ages knew better than ourselves what is magnificence, and how to produce it; and what a glorious work must that have been, both in its mere sheen of burnished gold, and in its illuminating art, which shines thus through the gloom of perhaps four centuries.|$|R
