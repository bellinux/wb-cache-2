Light response curves of CO 2 assimilation and stomatal conductance (g s) were also evaluated under controlled (<b>optimum)</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>condition.</b> Under this condition, CO 2 assimilation of 'Carioca' was not saturated at 2, 000 µmol m- 2 s- 1, whereas Guarumbé and 'Ouro Negro' exhibited {{different levels of}} light saturation. All genotypes showed dynamic photoinhibition and reversible {{increase in the minimum}} chlorophyll fluorescence yield under natural condition, as well as lower photosynthetic capacity when compared with <b>optimum</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>condition.</b> Since differences in g s were not observed between natural and controlled conditions for Guarumbé and 'Ouro Negro', the lower photosynthetic capacity of these genotypes under natural condition seems to be caused by high temperature effects on biochemical reactions, as suggested by increased alternative electron sinks. The highest g s values of 'Carioca' were observed at controlled condition, providing evidences that reduction of photosynthetic capacity at natural condition was due to low g s in addition to the high temperature effects on the photosynthetic apparatus. 'Carioca' exhibited the highest photosynthetic rates under <b>optimum</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>condition,</b> and was more affected by daily changes of air temperature and leaf-to-air vapor pressure difference...|$|R

The CCD of RSM generated models could precisely predict the percentage removals of phenol, 4 -CP and COD which signified the models reliability. The experimented process variables namely, SAC dosage and pH, did not conspicuously interact amidst the removal of phenol via SAC adsorption. Furthermore, only SAC dosage played the role to kindle the phenol adsorption proportionally to its quantity. However, the interaction of process variables was observed at their coded levels from 0 to + 1 coded units whilst the 4 -CP was adsorbed by SAC. The interaction within this range showed that the increase of pH had impoverished the 4 -CP adsorption though raising the SAC dosage could partially offset the unfavorable effect of pH. As COD in the binary solution was virtually due {{to the presence of}} phenol and 4 -CP, the process variables influenced the COD adsorption manifested the intermediary interaction characteristics of these phenolic compounds. The adsorption capacity of SAC revealed that 90 and 100  % of phenol and 4 -CP, respectively, could be removed from the binary solution at the SAC dosage of 3.5  g/L and pH of lower than 9.00. The CCD program predicted nine possible <b>optimum</b> process variable <b>conditions</b> for the maximum removal of phenol, 4 -CP and COD, in which SAC dosage all remained constant at 3.5  g/L.

We use game theory to model phenological adaptation in migratory birds that compete for territories at their breeding grounds. We investigate how the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for the timing of arrival is affected by changes in the onset of spring, the timing of the resource peak, and the season length. We compare the ESS mean arrival date with the <b>environmental</b> <b>optimum,</b> that is, the mean arrival date that maximizes fitness in the absence of competition. When competition is strong, the ESS mean arrival date responds less than the <b>environmental</b> <b>optimum</b> to shifts in the resource peak but more to changes in the onset of spring. Increased season length may not necessarily affect the <b>environmental</b> <b>optimum</b> but can still advance the ESS mean arrival date. Conversely, shifting a narrow resource distribution may change the <b>environmental</b> <b>optimum</b> without affecting the ESS mean arrival date. The ESS mean arrival date and the <b>environmental</b> <b>optimum</b> may even shift in different directions. Hence, treating phenology as an evolutionary game rather than an optimization problem fundamentally changes what we predict to be an adaptive response to environmental changes...|$|R

During <b>optimum</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions,</b> photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was the primary climatic factor controlling daytime NEE, accounting for 67 to 89 % of variations in NEE. However, soil water content (SWC) was the dominant factor limiting the NEE-PAR response during the peak growth stage, as NEE was significantly depressed when PAR exceeding 1300 μmol photons m − 2 s − 1 coincided with a very low soil water content (SWC< 0. 04 m 3 m − 3). Hysteresis was observed between daytime NEE and PAR during periods of water-stress resulting from high vapor pressure deficit (VPD). This is significant since it limits the range of applicability of the Michaelis-Menten equation, and the likes, to determine daytime NEE {{as a function of}} PAR.

A global and integrative analysis, using "gene expression dynamics inspector" (GEDI) self-organizing maps, reveals different degrees in the responses of the transcriptome when using different environmental conditions or microgravity/hypergravity simulation devices. Although the genes that are affected are different in each simulation technique, we find that the same gene ontology groups, including at least one large multigene family related with behavior, stress response or organogenesis, are over represented in each case. Conclusions These results suggest that the transcriptome as a whole can be finely tuned to gravity force. In <b>optimum</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions,</b> the alteration of gravity has only mild effects on gene expression but when environmental conditions are far from optimal, the gene expression must be tuned greatly and effects become more robust, probably linked to the lack of experience of organisms exposed to evolutionary novel environments such as a gravitational free one...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Bioremediation uses {{microbial}} metabolism {{in the presence}} of <b>optimum</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> and sufficient nutrients to breakdown contaminants notably petroleum hydrocarbons. We reviewed technologies for carrying out bioremediation and observed that biotechnological approaches that are designed to carry out remediation have received {{a great deal of attention}} in recent years. Biostimulation (meaning the addition of limiting nutrients to support microbial growth) and Bioaugmentation (meaning the addition of living cells capable of degradation) studies have enjoyed a heavy presence in literature and reviews of these technologies focusing on the technical aspects are very few if at all available. At times, nutrient application alone or augmenting with microbes is not sufficient enough for remediation leading to a simultaneous approach. Recent studies show that a combination of both approaches is equally feasible but not explicitly more beneficial. Evidently, selection of a technology hinges on site specific requirements such as availability of microorganisms capable of degradation in sufficient quantities, nutrient availability to support microbial growth and proliferation as well as environmental parameters such as temperature in combination with duration of exposure. This review focuses on these technologies and efforts are directed towards eventual manipulation of the processes of remediation all geared towards making bioremediatio...|$|R
40|$|Poultry {{production}} at all scales of operation is wholly {{dependent on the}} supply of day-old chicks. Fertility and hatchability are two major parameters that highly influence the supply of day-old chicks. Fertility refers to the percentage of incubated eggs that are fertile while hatchability is the percentage of fertile eggs that hatch. It is therefore {{important to understand the}} factors that influence fertility and hatchability of eggs. For the hatchability traits, breed has little effect on hatchability of poultry eggs, although light breeds have been reported to have higher fertility and hatchability. The diet of breeder poultry should be adequate in both quality and quantity to meet the recommended levels set out in the feed standards for the category. The most influential egg parameters that influence hatchability are: weight, shell thickness and porosity, shape index (described as maximum breadth to length ratio) and the consistency of the contents. Heat stress reduces the external and internal egg qualities. Heat stress affects all phases of semen production in breeder cocks. Hatchability for small eggs is lower compared to that of medium and large eggs. There are many factors contributing to the failure of a fertile egg to hatch which include lethal genes, insufficient nutrients in the egg and exposure to conditions that do not {{meet the needs of the}} developing embryo. Breeder factors that affect hatchability include strain, health, nutrition and age of the flock, egg size, weight and quality, egg storage duration and <b>conditions.</b> The <b>optimum</b> temperature range for poultry is 12 - 26 o C. Fertile eggs should not be stored for more than 10 - 14 days, after 14 days of storage; hatchability begins to decline significantly. The position (large end up or vice versa) of egg storage influences hatchability. Eggs stored with the small end up have higher hatchability as compared to the large end up. Incubation of fertile eggs can be done naturally by a broody hen or in an incubator. The broody hen provides the fertile eggs with <b>optimum</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> (temperature, egg turning and humidity) to stimulate embryonic development until hatching. The incubator is a simulated artificial design that mimics the broody hens role of providing fertile eggs with <b>optimum</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> (temperature, egg turning and humidity) to stimulate embryonic development until hatching. A constant incubation temperature of 37. 8 o C is the thermal homeostasis in the chick embryo and gives the best embryo development and hatchability. Mortality is seen if the temperature drops below 35. 6 o C or rises above 39. 4 o C for a number of hours. Egg turning during incubation is critical for successful hatching and influences hatchability. No turning of eggs during incubation results in low hatchability and delays hatch by a few days...|$|R
