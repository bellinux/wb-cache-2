25|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of zopiclone {{in humans}} are stereoselective. After oral {{administration of the}} racemic mixture, Cmax (time to maximum plasma concentration), area under the plasma time-concentration curve (AUC) and terminal elimination half-life values are higher for the <b>dextrorotatory</b> enantiomers, owing to the slower total clearance and smaller volume of distribution (corrected by the bioavailability), compared with the levorotatory enantiomer. In urine, the concentrations of the <b>dextrorotatory</b> enantiomers of the N-demethyl and N-oxide metabolites are {{higher than those of}} the respective antipodes.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of the hydroxy-group on the benzylic C of the synephrine molecule creates a chiral center, so the compound exists {{in the form of}} two enantiomers, d- and l- synephrine, or as the racemic mixture, d,l- synephrine. The <b>dextrorotatory</b> d-isomer corresponds to the (S)-configuration, and the levorotatory l-isomer to the (R)-configuration.|$|E
25|$|Racemic {{epinephrine}} {{has historically}} been used {{for the treatment of}} croup. Regular epinephrine however works equally well. Racemic adrenaline is a 1:1 mixture of the <b>dextrorotatory</b> (D) and levorotatory (L) isomers of adrenaline. The L-form is the active component. Racemic adrenaline works by stimulation of the alpha adrenergic receptors in the airway, with resultant mucosal vasoconstriction and decreased subglottic edema, and by stimulation of the β adrenergic receptors, with resultant relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscle.|$|E
25|$|Dextromethorphan is the <b>dextrorotatory</b> {{enantiomer}} of levomethorphan, {{which is}} the methyl ether of levorphanol, both opioid analgesics. It is named according to IUPAC rules as (+)-3-methoxy-17-methyl-9α,13α,14α-morphinan. As its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as an odorless, opalescent white powder. It is freely soluble in chloroform and insoluble in water; the hydrobromide salt is water-soluble up to 1.5g/100 mL at 25°C. Dextromethorphan is commonly available as the monohydrated hydrobromide salt, however some newer extended-release formulations contain dextromethorphan bound to an ion-exchange resin based on polystyrene sulfonic acid. Dextromethorphan's specific rotation in water is +27.6° (20°C, Sodium D-line).|$|E
25|$|Pasteur {{noticed that}} {{crystals}} of tartrates had small faces. Then he observed that, in racemic mixtures of tartrates, {{half of the}} crystals were right-handed and half were left-handed. In solution, the right-handed compound was <b>dextrorotatory,</b> and the left-handed one was levorotatory. Pasteur determined that optical activity related {{to the shape of}} the crystals, and that an asymmetric internal arrangement of the molecules of the compound was responsible for twisting the light. The (2R,3R)- and (2S,3S)- tartrates were isometric, non-superposable mirror images of each other. This was the first time anyone had demonstrated molecular chirality, and also the first explanation of isomerism.|$|E
2500|$|The XO-31 {{suffered}} from directional instability and experiments {{were made with}} various fin, auxiliary fins, and rudder shapes, {{in an effort to}} cure the problem. The second aircraft was completed as the YO-31, with a geared Curtiss V-1570-7 Conqueror engine and an enlarged fin, 3" [...] longer cowling, and a two-blade, <b>dextrorotatory</b> propeller. Four YO-31A aircraft delivered during early 1932 were modified radically with an elliptical wing planform, a new tail assembly, a smooth semimonocoque fuselage, three-blade propeller, and a canopy over the cockpits. The aircraft appeared with a variety of tail units, the final version (five built) designated O-31A featured a very pointed fin with an inset rudder. The single YO-31B was an unarmed staff transport and the sole YO-31C converted from YO-31A had cantilever main landing gear, and a ventral bulge in the fuselage, which enabled the observer to operate his single 0.3-in (7.62mm) machine-gun more effectively from a standing position.|$|E
2500|$|Four isomers of {{methylphenidate}} are possible, {{since the}} molecule has two chiral centers. One pair of threo isomers and {{one pair of}} erythro are distinguished, from which primarily d-threo-methylphenidate exhibits the pharmacologically desired effects. The erythro diastereomers are pressor amines, a property not shared with the threo diastereomers. When the drug was first introduced it was sold as a 4:1 mixture of erythro:threo diastereomers, but it was later reformulated to contain only the threo diastereomers. [...] "TMP" [...] refers to a threo product that does not contain any erythro diastereomers, i.e. (±)-threo-methylphenidate. Since the threo isomers are energetically favored, {{it is easy to}} epimerize out any of the undesired erythro isomers. The drug that contains only <b>dextrorotatory</b> methylphenidate is sometimes called d-TMP, although this name is only rarely used and it is much more commonly referred to as dexmethylphenidate, d-MPH, or d-threo-methylphenidate. A review on the synthesis of enantiomerically pure (2R,2R)-(+)-threo-methylphenidate hydrochloride has been published.|$|E
2500|$|The {{classical}} {{description of}} F-actin {{states that it}} has a filamentous structure that can be considered to be a single stranded levorotatory helix with a rotation of 166° around the helical axis and an axial translation of 27.5 Å, or a single stranded <b>dextrorotatory</b> helix with a cross over spacing of 350-380 Å, with each actin surrounded by four more. The symmetry of the actin polymer at 2.17 subunits per turn of a helix is incompatible with the formation of crystals, which is only possible with a symmetry of exactly 2, 3, 4 or 6 subunits per turn. Therefore, models have to be constructed that explain these anomalies using data from electron microscopy, cryo-electron microscopy, crystallization of dimers in different positions and diffraction of X-rays. It {{should be pointed out that}} it is not correct to talk of a “structure” for a molecule as dynamic as the actin filament. In reality we talk of distinct structural states, in these the measurement of axial translation remains constant at 27.5 Å while the subunit rotation data shows considerable variability, with displacements of up to 10% from its optimum position commonly seen. Some proteins, such as cofilin appear to increase the angle of turn, but again this could be interpreted as the establishment of different [...] "structural states". These could be important in the polymerization process.|$|E

It indicates that the C-5 chiral center has the same handedness as that of D-glyceraldehyde (which was so labeled because it is <b>dextrorotatory).</b> The fact that D-glucose is <b>dextrorotatory</b> is a combined effect of its four chiral centers, not just of C-5; and indeed {{some of the other}} D-aldohexoses are levorotatory.|$|E

50|$|A {{compound}} with dextrorotation {{is called}} <b>dextrorotatory</b> or dextrorotary, while a compound with levorotation is called levorotatory or levorotary.
