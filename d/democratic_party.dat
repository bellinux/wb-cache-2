40|$|Constructing the {{mechanism}} for the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Parties</b> to participate in politics plays {{an important part in}} the multi-party cooperation system. However, many problems existing in China's current political mechanism have prevented the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Parties</b> from playing their roles, such as, the weak consciousness in political participation of the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Parties,</b> the unsound organization mechanism and the backwardness of the institutional construction in political participation resulting from their characteristics and the social reality. In light of these problems, the awareness in political participation of <b>Democratic</b> <b>Parties</b> should be enhanced, organizational construction should be strengthened and the political participation system should be innovated in the process of multi-party cooperation. </p...|$|R

Prior to its passage at the convention, White's proposal received strong opposition. Tariff reform and anti-monopoly resolutions similar to White's proposal were adopted by the national <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> {{as part of its}} 1888 platform.

5|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 2006 Swedish general election, Reinfeldt was {{subjected}} to a smear campaign. Mats Lindström, a staff member in the Social <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> headquarters, admitted to sending e-mails accusing Reinfeldt of tax fraud, false financial declarations and only attaining his position because of his father's influence. The IP address used in the e-mails was traced to the Social <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> headquarters. Social <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> Secretary Marita Ulvskog apologized and said that such behavior was completely unacceptable. A short time after the e-mail campaign, images that depicted Reinfeldt and the Moderate Party in an unflattering light were spread internally within the Social <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> and subsequently leaked to the media. Social <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> spokeswoman Carina Persson confirmed that the material came from the Social Democratic Youth League, but denied the existence of an official smear campaign and stated that the material was not meant to be released or spread to a wider audience.|$|E
