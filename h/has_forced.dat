5|$|At Dunder-Mifflin, Clark Green (Clark Duke) {{returns from}} his stint as Jan Levinson's (Melora Hardin) sexual assistant. Despite the awkward {{past couple of}} weeks, Jan has gifted them an espresso machine, {{and the rest of}} the office jumps on the {{opportunity}} to 'test' out several espresso flavors. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) enlists Clark's help to snag a newly freed account at a suit warehouse; the two will pose as a father and son so that they can successfully sell to the Stones, father and son owners of the warehouse. Dwight leads off on how proud he is of Clark to elder Stone (Ed Lauter), but when Stone admits that he and his son are not on good terms, Dwight and Clark awkwardly shift gears and begin a show of childishly sniping at each other. Clark tries to move on to business, but Dwight continues to interrupt him with insults, and even makes a dig at the younger Stone (Will Greenberg) when he arrives. When the elder Stone reveals that his son <b>has</b> <b>forced</b> him out of the company and that he is now there strictly for his own social benefit, Clark takes the lead and makes the sale to the younger Stone. Both Dwight and Clark also buy a suit from the company to celebrate their team sale.|$|E

A badly-injured Scotty {{staggers}} into the cabin and dies of his wounds, having been attacked by the trees. While Ash tries {{to figure out what to}} do, both Linda and Cheryl pretend to be cured, only to quickly revert to their demonic forms.

He tries to cut up her remains with a chainsaw, but can't bring himself to do so, and ends up burying her instead. When he reaches for her necklace on the ground, she escapes again trying to kill him. Ash decapitates her with a shovel, and her headless body bleeds all over Ash's face as it tries to rape him before he escapes. Back in the cabin, he quickly realizes that Cheryl <b>has</b> <b>forced</b> open the trapdoor. After wounding her with a shotgun, he heads to the basement for more ammunition. There, the entity tortures him by dousing him with blood from a pipe, while more blood seeps from the walls and ceilings.|$|E
