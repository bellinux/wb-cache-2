50|$|A simple {{indication}} {{of the quality of}} a printing press is the number of <b>distribution</b> and form <b>rollers.</b> The greater the number of <b>distribution</b> <b>rollers,</b> the more accurate the control of ink uniformity. It is difficult to ink large solid areas on a plate with only one ink form roller. With three (generally the maximum), it is relatively easy to maintain consistent ink coverage of almost any image area on the plate. Business forms presses, which print very little coverage, usually only have one or two ink form rollers. Because of this, they cannot print large solid or screen images. Smaller, less sophisticated presses also have the same problem, however, many of the newer presses today are being equipped with larger, better inking systems to meet the growing print demands of the consumer.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{quality of}} powder of {{non-metal}} materials directly {{relates to the}} force exerted on grinding roller, while the force on grinding roller relates to {{the thickness of the}} material layer. The uneven pressure <b>distribution</b> between the <b>roller</b> and material layer is caused by the drum-shaped characteristics of vertical mill grinding roller.

50|$|The ink {{fountain}} stores {{a quantity of}} ink in a reservoir and feeds small quantities of ink to the distribution rollers from the {{ink fountain}} roller and the ink ductor roller. The ink ductor roller is a movable roller that moves {{back and forth between}} the ink fountain roller and an ink <b>distribution</b> <b>roller.</b> As the ductor contacts the ink fountain roller, both turn and the ductor is inked. The ductor then swings forward to contact an ink <b>distribution</b> <b>roller</b> and transfers ink to it. There are generally two types of ink distribution rollers: the ink rotating rollers (or ink transfer rollers), which rotate in one direction, and the ink oscillating rollers (or ink vibrating rollers), which rotate and move from side to side. The ink distribution rollers receive ink and work it into a semiliquid state that is uniformly delivered to the ink form rollers. A thin layer of ink is then transferred to the image portions of the lithographic plate by the ink form rollers.|$|E
5000|$|Continuous-flow {{dampening}} systems (direct or indirect), {{are used}} by most newer presses today {{because they do not}} have the slow reaction time of intermittent-flow dampening systems. They do not employ the water ductor roller but use the water slip roller (a roller in contact with both the water fountain roller and a <b>distribution</b> <b>roller,</b> contrary to the water ductor roller that moves back and forth between the two) for a continuous flow. The speed of the water slip roller controls the supply. The use of alcohol on these type of dampeners was standard for years. Alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) was used as it increased the water viscosity and made it [...] "more wettable" [...] so that transfer was easier from one roller to the other. However, alcohol substitutes such as glycol ethers, butyl cellusolve, etc., are being used today to accomplish the same task because alcohol contains volatile organic compounds. Roller hardness is also being changed to help accomplish the same job—easy transfer of the water.|$|E

This paper explores the existence of anisotropy in the spatial distribution of roller-measured soil stiffness {{and the effect of}} anisotropy on kriging. Field testing was conducted to collect roller measurement value (MV) data over typical roadway embankment evaluation areas and on a large square area to enable a robust investigation of anisotropy. Semi-variogram {{analysis of}} the field data clearly indicates that range anisotropy exists. The spatial <b>distribution</b> of <b>roller</b> MV data is different in the longitudinal x direction than in the transverse y direction. Magnitudes of range anisotropy (x range/y range) varied from 2. 4 to over 5. The observed range anisotropy is not due to the roller measurement system; rather, it is likely due to the directional nature of earthwork construction activities and to alignment geometry. The influence of anisotropy on kriging was found to be significant when considering the use of kriged data in earthwork specifications. The error introduced by not accounting for anisotropy in kriging varied from 5 % to 17 % when considering pass to pass or layer to layer map analysis. Anisotropy in the spatial <b>distribution</b> of <b>roller</b> MV data should be factored into kriging and other geostatistical analyses.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2008. Rolling {{contact is}} {{experienced}} {{by a large}} number of components in mechanical designs. Examples include roller bearings and ink <b>distribution</b> <b>rollers</b> in the printing industry. Rolling contact results in surface wear. It is however possible to reduce rolling contact wear rates and surface fatigue by performing a surface modification such as powdered metal coating [35]. Powder coating methods such as Laser cladding and Plasma coating are two application processes that are completely different in method and therefore create different coating microstructures and bonding mechanisms between the coating and substrate. The aim of the research was to investigate the comparative rolling contact performance of two coating processes and two separate metal powder compositions. The coatings were applied to British standard En 9 steel test specimens. En 9 was selected due to its popular use in the manufacture of shafts, cylinders and rollers. Under rolling contact, material is removed from the surface as a result of wear and surface fatigue. Through testing and evaluation, the performance of the coating application processes were evaluated relative to one another and relative to the uncoated steel under rolling contact. The performance of the coating compositions were also evaluated against one another for a given coating application process. Results used to determine the performance of the coatings and coating processes were, the number of cycles to failure and the wear rates of the coated surface. Microstructure pictures of the coated surface were taken prior to testing and following testing. The pictures were used to qualitatively determine the effects of the rolling contact on the surfaces. Through the study of rolling contact, an explanation of the stresses induced in the contact area and the position of the maximum values were determined. The boundaries for the deformation regimes were identified through the understanding of the position of first yield and the shakedown limit under rolling contact. The theories of rolling contact fatigue are covered briefly as part of {{a better understanding of the}} failure mechanism however the experimentation is largely comparative based...|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} intent {{of this research}} was to verify that a new method - called the Little Joe method in this report - could be used to verify that CMY offset inks conform to ISO 2846. This method would use less time to generate multiple ink film thicknesses (IFTs) than the traditionally used ISO 2834 method. With a graduated gage, a Little Joe proofer can be used to produce multiple IFTs on a single sample. However, the absolute thickness values for those IFTs are unknown. Therefore, to calibrate these unknown IFTs, a calibration curve that relates IFT and optical density should be used. Such a curve would have to be built based on samples produced by the method described in ISO 2834 using an IGT printability tester. The question is: will both methods (the traditional ISO 2834 method and the Little Joe method), either accept or reject a given sample? This research found that the same IFTs on both samples {{do not have the same}} colorimetric values. The ink film was not as smooth on the Little Joe prints as it was on the IGT prints. The presence of tiny white spots throughout the Little Joe sample add a gray component to the color. The difference in smoothness of the ink layer on the Little Joe proofer comes from the ink not being 2 ̆ 2 worked 2 ̆ 2 as much as it is on the <b>distribution</b> <b>rollers</b> of the IGT printer. Therefore, the ink is less liquid and not able to completely spread out and cover the paper. The answer to the research question is that the two methods do not both either accept or reject a given sample. Towards the conclusion of this research, Professor Franz Sigg and the researcher made some improvement to the traditional ISO 2834 method and eventually invented a more efficient method: the modified ISO 2834 method. A high input volume of ink (0. 1 cc) was applied to the IGT inking unit. Then, while the inking unit was kept running without adding new ink, the disc was weighed before and after each print and was then re-inked to made another print. As samples were printed, the ink on the inking unit was reduced, producing prints with progressively thinner ink film thicknesses in rapid progression since no cleaning was needed between prints. This allowed the prints to be produced in a much shorter time than with the original ISO 2834 method. The result of the modified ISO 2834 method agreed with that of the original method within a tolerance of 1 DeltaE. Therefore, both methods can accept or reject a given sample at the same time...|$|R

40|$|Paper I of {{this series}} showed that the {{relationship}} between the inlet and outlet particle-size <b>distributions</b> in a <b>roller</b> milling operation can be found by integrating, over the range of input particles, the breakage of each individual particle as a function of its physical characteristics. This is possible because particles break independently during roller milling. The pattern of breakage for individual particles is called the breakage function. This paper considers the form of the breakage function and determines it experimentally for roller milling of wheat. The breakage function is shown to depend critically on the ratio of roll gap to input particle size (the milling ratio). For a given ratio, the breakage function for wheat grains is linear with respect to output particle size, over a wide range. This {{is quite different from the}} particle-size distribution produced by, e. g., hammer milling. It perhaps explains why roller milling is so suited to milling of wheat to produce flour; the broad and even distribution of particle sizes produced allows effective separation of bran and efficient recovery of white flour. Breakage functions depend on wheat variety and physical characteristics and on the design and operation of the roller mill. Single-kernel testing is becoming widespread in wheat quality testing; distributions of individual kernel parameters, such as size, mass, hardness and moisture content, are measured. The breakage function approach potentially provides a link between single-kernel testing and milling performance...|$|R

40|$|HPGRs {{have since}} {{introduced}} in the 1980 s (Kellerwessel, 1993; Schönert, 1988), now become integral comminution units at several minerals processing plants around the world. Even though {{a lot of the}} initial issues concerning performance, availability and wear have been addressed and solved there are still phenomena and aspects which can be improved and understood further. Schönert and Sander (2002) presented experimental results and a mechanistic model including the internal force dynamics between the rollers and the compacted bed. They derived expressions for the pressure distribution involving most of the influencing terms and effects. However, in order to solve the differential equations several of the terms vanish by assumptions. The Schönert and Sander model reflects the experimental data in many aspects but the predicted shear force distinctly deviates from the experimental results at the angular position of the peak pressure level. This finding suggests that the particle to particle interaction and breakage process in the different zones seen in Figure 1 are complex and difficult to model using analytical models. A numerical modelling approach using DEM does not require the same amount of assumptions and simplifications of boundary conditions. Hence such modelling may provide further knowledge and vital understanding. In this paper the breakage process is simulated in order to investigate the shear slip behaviour and how it relates to different operating variables. A laboratory scale HPGR corresponding to the experimental setup used by Schönert (2002) have been modelled in EDEM (DEM-Solutions). The bonded particle model (BPM) is used for modelling quartz particles (Potyondy, 2004). The breakage model strength parameters are calibrated against interparticle breakage experiments in an Instron 400 RD compression device.
