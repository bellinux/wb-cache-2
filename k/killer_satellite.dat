5|$|Released in 1981, Asteroids Deluxe is {{the first}} sequel to Asteroids. Dave Shepperd edited the code and made {{enhancements}} to the game without Logg's involvement. The onscreen objects were tinted blue, and hyperspace {{was replaced by a}} shield that depleted if used. The asteroids rotate, and the added <b>killer</b> <b>satellite</b> enemy breaks apart into three smaller ships when hit that home in on the player's position. The arcade machine's monitor displays vector graphics overlaying a holographic backdrop. The game is much harder than the original and does not allow saucers to be hunteda common strategy for Asteroids high scores.|$|E

5000|$|He first {{appeared}} in the G.I. Joe animated series in the A Real American Hero mini-series. He was voiced by Frank Welker. In the mini-series, he was generally featured alongside another Joe, Steeler; for example, the two teamed with Clutch to create a <b>killer</b> <b>satellite</b> that was used unsuccessfully to destroy the Relay Star Satellite. He later paired up with Steeler again to man a copter during [...] "Operation Big Lift." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Killer</b> <b>Satellites</b> are an {{expansion}} that allows military units in space (only good against other K-sats or L-stars). Neutron Bombs work like nukes, only {{they do not}} make the affected territory uninhabitable.|$|R
25|$|In Jimmie H. Butler's 1991 novel Red Lightning, Black Thunder, the U.S. deploys a Lockheed C-141 Starlifter out of Hawaii in {{a mission}} to launch ASAT {{missiles}} against a Soviet network of <b>killer</b> <b>satellites.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Sino-Japanese station: Also {{known as}} the Graveyard, it was cut up by a <b>killer</b> <b>satellite</b> during the Flash and now is a cloud of dust. For those in the Zone, this was an easy but desperate choice, see necessities of life {{for a bit of}} this. The {{surviving}} stations, ships and various other remnants that haven't seen their orbit decay have been utilized to the mutual benefit of the entire community.|$|E

50|$|Word {{of the new}} strike inbound reaches Gibson and the Space Ranger forces, {{with four}} modules in orbit to stop the warheads. While the {{satellites}} destroy many MIRV warheads, three are destroyed by the Soviets' <b>killer</b> <b>satellite</b> network and one warhead severely damages the fourth and the Space Voyager shuttle. Wataru decides {{to head to the}} last remaining satellite and repair it ahead of another wave of MIRVs before his oxygen ran out. The module is repaired and Wataru shoots down seven MIRVs, but is forced to maneuver the satellite to get close and shoot down the eighth bearing down on Los Angeles, but the blast shakes him loose from the module and out into space. Laura, who was evacuated to the US after being caught in the Soviet airstrikes on Japan, flies in another shuttle to save Wataru while Kutuzov orders the crew of a nearby Soviet space station to rescue him.|$|E
50|$|The {{catalyst}} for conflict comes in July 1985, when a U.S. Marine Corps unit intervenes against a Soviet incursion into Yugoslavia. In response, the Warsaw Pact mobilizes and subsequently launches a full-scale invasion of Western Europe on 4 August 1985 (the {{anniversary of the}} start of the First World War). Soviet forces thrust through West Germany towards the Rhine, and also land forces in northern Norway and Turkey. Attacks are also carried out using long-range strategic bombing, naval forces, and even <b>killer</b> <b>satellites</b> in space.|$|R
5000|$|Warnings {{from the}} [...] "on-board computer" [...] of each {{impending}} attack wave. These include an alarm sound and flashing text, {{as well as}} a spoken warning if the speech synthesizer is connected, except concerning the approach of <b>Killer</b> <b>Satellites,</b> which start appearing after the third asteroid belt at the beginning of level 4 with no warning at all. The manual incorrectly states that they appear {{at the end of each}} level, starting with level 4. In some Parsec cartridges, the warning text misspells Asteroid.|$|R
50|$|The {{optional}} speech synthesis, although advanced at the time, adds {{drama to}} the gameplay: Although it warns of advancing enemy craft (except for <b>Killer</b> <b>Satellites)</b> and of low fuel levels, {{both of these}} features are duplicated by on-screen visual cues and are easily predictable by an experienced player. The sole exception is in the asteroid belts between levels, whose length increases with the level number: The speech synthesizer provides a spoken countdown not duplicated by any on-screen display, such that without the speech synthesizer {{there is no indication}} of how long the asteroid belt will last.|$|R
40|$|The Universal Interface Software(UIS) Protocol was a Theater Missile Defense Gateway Protocol which {{linked the}} Strategic Defense Initiative(SDI) Architecture <b>Killer</b> <b>Satellite</b> Software Protocol to the National Test Bed Simulation Software Protocol to enable neural network shock loop {{operation}} when ICBMS were approaching the SDI Shield. A Gateway Software {{is required for}} Homeland Defense and Security Systems to communicate the sensor information from hardware and software boxes at airports and government buildings and other locations to the Global Information Grid(GIG). Therefore, a Homeland Defense and Security UIS(HDSUIS) Protocol is achieved by UIS conversion to HDSUIS for Thresholds Stabilization and GIG and terrorist sensor Enhancements, Homeland Defense and Security Lagrangian equation and GIG simulation facility timing chart Alterations, and two Catastrophe Theory Protocol Attachments to the UIS Geometric software structure inner cube. This UIS Protocol conversion to the HDSUIS Protocol will track and provide a Congestion Controlled, i. e.,prevention of deadlock and livelock, communication of (1) Shoe bombers and copycat shoe bombers, (2) deeply buried and imbedded boxes with explosives, (3) damage to lase 1 equipment, (4) shoulder missile fired armament, and (5) surface to air missiles from their sensor equipment to the Global Information Grid with Theater Missile Defense Characteristics. The Homeland Defense and Security GNNO(Geometric Neural Network Overlay) Protocol will be derived as a conversion of the UIS GNNO Protocol...|$|E
50|$|Three {{waves of}} fighters attack, {{alternating}} with three waves of cruisers. Enemy ships enter the screen {{one at a}} time. A ship flying off the left edge of the screen wraps around {{to the right side}} and attacks again. A new fighter can appear with others still on the screen, whereas a new cruiser will not come until the previous one is destroyed. The fighters pose only the threat of collision, while the cruisers fire on the player's ship. The fighter types are named Swoopers, LTFs (Light Triangular Fighters), and Saucers. The cruisers are called Urbites, Dramites, and Bynites. Each level ends with an asteroid belt, in which an array of asteroids advance on the ship and must be avoided or shot. At the end of each asteroid belt, any remaining asteroids are cleared away and the color of the ground is changed, then a new wave of Swoopers begins. Starting with level 4, the Swoopers are preceded by a random number of <b>Killer</b> <b>Satellites,</b> which come without the usual computer warning.|$|R
40|$|About 1. 9 % of ribosomes {{translating}} the gag {{open reading frame}} of the yeast L-A double-stranded RNA virus positive strand undergo a - 1 frameshift and continue translating in the pol open reading frame to make a 170 -kDa gag-pol fusion protein. The importance of frameshifting efficiency for viral propagation was tested in a system where the M 1 (<b>killer</b> toxin-encoding) <b>satellite</b> RNA {{is supported by a}} full-length L-A cDNA clone. Either increasing or decreasing the frameshift efficiency more than twofold by alterations in the slippery site disrupted viral propagation. A threefold increase caused by a chromosomal mutation, hsh 1 (high shifter), had the same effect. Substituting a + 1 ribosomal frameshift site from Ty 1 with the correct efficiency also allowed support of M 1 propagation. The normal - 1 frameshift efficiency is similar to the observed molar ratio in viral particles of the 170 -kDa gag-pol protein to the 70 -kDa gag gene product, the major coat protein. The results are interpreted in terms of a packaging model for L-A...|$|R
