50|$|Chrysochus auratus, the <b>dogbane</b> <b>beetle,</b> {{of eastern}} North America, {{is a member}} of the insect {{subfamily}} Eumolpinae. It is primarily found east of the Rocky Mountains. One of the brightest in its family, it is iridescent blue-green with a metallic copper, golden or crimson shine. Its diet consists of dogbane and milkweed. It measures between 8 and 11 mm (less than 0.5 inches) and has a convex, oval shape.|$|E
50|$|They {{generally}} resemble other Chrysomelidae, but {{differ in}} having front coxae rounded and third tarsal segment bilobed beneath. Many are metallic, or yellow and spotted. The <b>dogbane</b> <b>beetle</b> (Chrysochus auratus or C. fabricius), for instance, is very attractive—iridescent blue-green with a coppery tinge, it measures 8-10 mm, and is found on dogbane and milkweed. Some, such {{as members of}} the genus Macrocoma, are unusually setaceous and with unusually prominent mandibles for members of the family Chrysomelidae.|$|E
40|$|Small patches in {{fragmented}} habitats might {{function as}} sinks, as islands suitable for colonization, {{or they might}} facilitate movement of animals through the matrix from one suitable patch to another even though they might not support self-sustaining populations. Using mark-recapture procedures with the monophagous <b>dogbane</b> <b>beetle</b> (Clll) lsochus auratus), we examined the use of experimental clusters of its host plant, Indian hemp dogbane (Apocynum cannabinum), radiating out from large, natural patches. Experimental clusters of plants were placed as single clusters at varying distances up to 100 m from seven natural patches and in 2 ̆ 2 stepping stone 2 ̆ 2 fashion of clusters every 25 m. Based on known movement pattems in the <b>dogbane</b> <b>beetle,</b> we expected that clusters of host plants would be found easily by individuals dispersing from the adjacent natural patch. As expected, over 90...|$|E
40|$|It {{happens at}} least once or twice every year; someone finds a {{brilliant}} metallic green beetle in a corn or soybean field and asks {{if it is a}} pest. The <b>dogbane</b> <b>beetle</b> is fairly large for an Iowa beetle, about 3 / 8 - 1 / 2 inch in length, but it feeds only on dogbane and milkweed. The larvae feed on the roots of these two plants; therefore, this insect is fairly common along roadsides, in pastures, and grassy filter strips in fields where these plants grow...|$|E
