50|$|Hirschman {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} backward and <b>forward</b> <b>linkages.</b> A forward linkage is created when investment in a particular project encourages investment in subsequent stages of production. A backward linkage is created when a project encourages investment in facilities that enable the project to succeed. Normally, projects create both forward and backward linkages. Investment should be made in those projects that have the greatest total number of linkages. Projects with many linkages will vary from country to country; knowledge about project linkages can be obtained through input and output studies.|$|E

30|$|The {{backward}} and <b>forward</b> <b>linkage</b> analysis was constructed {{to figure out}} the key sector in the economy. Industries have effects on the whole economy through their demand and supply relations with other industries. This demand and supply dependencies are called the {{backward and}} <b>forward</b> <b>linkage,</b> respectively. Generally, the backward linkage is derived from the Leontief model (Jones 1976; Cella 1984; Miller and Blair 2009). Leontief inverse matrix B shows the direct and indirect requirements of domestic output per unit of final demand in each sector, and it is also referred as the output multiplier. Output multiplier defines the total backward linkage as b_j^t = ∑_i = 1 ^nb_i,j. The superscript t refers to as the “total linkage” of each industry.|$|R

50|$|For a {{developing}} economy which experiences seriously regional imbalances, {{the structure of}} the economy does not allow all people to be employed and all factors {{to be used in the}} provinces. To tackle these problems through regionalizing both endogenous and unbalanced growth models, the Endogenous and Unbalanced Regional Growth (EURG) for regional economies has been modeled. In this model, the state is actively participating. In addition, the endogenous characteristics of regions are being considered with globalization, postmodernism and new economy. There are three units, first of which are planned for traditional agricultural sector, the second is for modern sector, and the third is for knowledge sector. In the first unit, the unqualified unemployed people are being employed by government initiatives. The backward and <b>forward</b> <b>linkages</b> are created among the regions. The second unit produces modern production. The third unit produces knowledge and knowledge-intensive output which supplies both internal and external markets. The more it sells to external markets, the more both regional and personal income rise. Triggered by the employment of regional people, the “developing by working” stage, which goes beyond the learning by doing, can be experienced. As for qualified people, the more they earn, the more they can save, so their aggregate income grows. Therefore, the higher capital and knowledge accumulation leads to boom in regional economy.|$|E

30|$|This study {{describes}} a structural decomposition analysis (SDA) of Japanese greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 1990 to 2005, focusing on four linkage {{structures in the}} Leontief inverse representing supply chains in Japan. The developed RAS-invariant decomposition was applied to Japanese linked input–output tables for the three 5 -year periods studied. It examined {{the effect of the}} Leontief inverse on emissions changes into the specific effects of <b>forward</b> <b>linkage,</b> backward linkage, the average of forward/backward linkage and kernel structure. Our SDA method solves the problem of parameter independence completely. The accuracy of those effects has been improved mathematically compared with conventional methods. For example, it was detected that backward linkage contributes to an increase in GHG emissions, while conventional methods erroneously determine a decrease. The results of the SDA confirmed that <b>forward</b> <b>linkage</b> and kernel structure contributed to a rise in GHG emissions, and that backward linkage consistently increased emissions in the three periods. Some sectors have robust linkage in the supply chain with consistently increasing emissions, which should be preferentially improved to mitigate their indirect GHG emissions in Japan.|$|R

The backward and <b>forward</b> <b>linkage</b> effects of FDI are negative with significant regional disparity. The geographic distribution of FDI also influences spillovers, with an increase in FDI inflow to the top FDI recipient provinces increasing the <b>forward</b> <b>linkage</b> spillovers.

Because transportation requires a variety of technology components, the positive backward linkages are reasonable. However, its negative innovation <b>forward</b> <b>linkages</b> imply that an improvement in transportation services exerts substitution effects on other sectors, {{at least in the short}} run.

30|$|The RAS method can be {{used for}} {{decomposition}} and mechanical updating of a matrix, whereby “R” stands for the diagonal matrix of elements modifying rows, “A” is the matrix to be updated and “S” is the diagonal matrix of column modifiers, hence “RAS”. There are two main forms of SDA: additive decomposition (Dietzenbacher and Los 1998) and multiplicative decomposition (Dietzenbacher et al. 2000), and both can be combined with the RAS method to decompose an input coefficient matrix or the Leontief inverse. For example, Dietzenbacher and Hoekstra (2002) analyzed the effects of R and S on the change in input coefficients by multiplicative SDA using the RAS method. Wood (2009) additively decomposed the Leontief inverse itself into three determinants: backward and <b>forward</b> <b>linkage</b> vectors and an industrial structure matrix, which was obtained by dividing the Leontief inverse into two matrices, as in the RAS method.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} 38 {{manufacturing companies}} for analyzing the <b>forward</b> and backward <b>linkages</b> and for estimating the production coefficients. The production coefficients of manufacturing industries were determined under 12 categories while the <b>forward</b> and backward <b>linkages</b> with other economic sectors were analyzed under 7 categories using the input-output model. The {{results show that}} the largest share (43 %) {{of the value of the}} total outputs produced by the manufacturing sub-sector in Amhara region was consumed by the service sector. The second prominent user is the final consumers, which directly consumed 36 % of the value of its total outputs. The industrial sector (13 %) and the export sector (5 %) took the third and fourth places in demanding its outputs. However, it supplied only a smaller portion of its outputs (3 %) to the agricultural sector, implying that it has a weak <b>forward</b> <b>linkage</b> with this sector. The major suppliers of inputs of the manufacturing sub-sector are service sector (41 %), industrial sector (22 %) and the import sector (18 %). The agricultural sector and other sectors supplied 10 % and 9 % of the total inputs of the sub-sector, respectively. The backward linkage of the manufacturing sub-sector to the agricultural sector is relatively better than the <b>forward</b> <b>linkage.</b> With a 58 % average production efficiency of the sub-sector, the production coefficients of each of the 12 manufacturing industries are estimated using major inputs and outputs.
