We build a group decision making model that tries to explain how a group dynamic can lead the group to interpret and recall data so that they correspond to more favorable beliefs about the group future prospects. Group members have to take one single common decision determining the group effort level in a joint production. We find that (a) An agent's <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> enter into denial when others are in denial is higher than an agent's <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> enter into denial when he is alone; (b) An agent's <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> enter into denial when others are realist is lower than an agent's <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> enter into denial when he is alone; (c) An agent's <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> enter into denial increases with the riskiness of the project; (d) {{the presence of a}} leader can either increase or decrease the <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> enter into denial depending on assumptions made on costs.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we define the {{relative}} deprivation {{of a person}} with income y as an increasing function {{of the percentage of}} individuals in the person's reference group whose income is larger than y. We obtain his satisfaction by adding up the marginal utilities of income over the range of income a person possesses. We model migration from one reference group to another as a response to relative deprivation and satisfaction: We say that a strong <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> migrate exists if relative deprivation decreases while satisfaction rises with migration and that a weak incentive exists if the individual increases or decreases his satisfaction and deprivation at the same time by migrating. We derive conditions under which different incentives, weak or strong, hold for different individuals. We obtain the result that in general the richest individual in a society will not have a strong <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> migrate but may have a weak <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> migrate, whereas the poorest individual may have a strong <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> migrate and also a weak <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> migrate. Our analysis enables us to explain several perplexing migratory phenomena, identify income inequality as a distinct explanatory variable of migration and establish an <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> migrate in situations where the utility-social welfare approach does not. ...|$|R

He immediately began preparing for another run for lieutenant governor in 1991. In the earlier campaign, the UMWA had been vociferously opposed to Patton because employees in his coal mines had been affiliated with the Southern Labor Union. Skipper Martin introduced him to Teamsters leaders, and Patton worked with them to unionize Pike County employees. He also worked with Kelsey Friend to pass the Kentucky Rural Economic Development Act, a measure giving financial <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> companies that located in economically depressed rural counties.|$|E

When R&D reduces expected costs in the particular sense of lirst-order stochastic dominance, a national strategic basis for R&D subsidies exists, whether firms choose prices or quantities. This must be balanced against a corrective <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> tax R&D whenever the number of domestic firms exceeds one. However, when R&D increases the riskiness of the cost distribution as well, the results may switch: there emerges a strategic <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> tax and a corrective <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> subsidize R&D. 1...|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} meeting, the {{governors}} also discussed {{the possibility of}} new tax <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> motivate industry to reduce pollution {{and the creation of}} a new interstate compact to set industry standards, which would require adoption by all member states and approval by Congress. Those four states were already members of the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC), an interstate agency that controls water pollution in the Delaware River. The proposed air-pollution compact was modeled after the DRBC and would function similarly, setting minimum air standards across states and enabling enforcement actions against polluters. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut adopted the proposed Mid-Atlantic States Air Pollution Control Compact with the possibility for Delaware and Pennsylvania to join in the future. Its approval by Congress became a policy goal of Rockefeller's failed primary bid for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination. The compact was never approved by Congress and thus never took effect.|$|E

After failing to secure increased funding for education in the 1984 legislative session, she conducted a statewide public awareness campaign in advance of a special legislative session the following year; the modified program was passed in that session. She successfully used economic <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> bring a Toyota manufacturing plant to Georgetown, Kentucky in 1986. Legal challenges to the incentives– which would have cost the state the plant and its related economic benefits– were eventually dismissed by the Kentucky Supreme Court. The state experienced record economic growth under Collins' leadership.|$|E

He was the only candidate for the position, with virtually all of his political opponents forbidden by law from running for office, and his fellow party members reduced to mere followers. That same year, Nasser had the Muslim Brotherhood chief ideologue Sayyed Qutb imprisoned. Qutb was charged and found guilty by the court of plotting to assassinate Nasser, and was executed in 1966. Beginning in 1966, as Egypt's economy slowed and government debt became increasingly burdensome, Nasser began to ease state control over the private sector, encouraging state-owned bank loans to private business and introducing <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> increase exports.
