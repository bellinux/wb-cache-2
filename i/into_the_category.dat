5|$|Tameka Williams {{qualified}} {{to run in}} the 100 meter and 200 meter sprints. Williams, who would later compete in the 2016 Rio Olympics, was disqualified because she admitted that she used a banned substance. She voluntarily told her Olympic committee about using a banned substance, and it was announced on July 29 that she would not compete. Williams admitted to using a drug named Blast Off Red, which is typically used to enhance the performance of racehorses and greyhounds. Williams had posted on Facebook that she was innocent and had passed drug tests prior to the Olympics. While the drug is not listed as prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency, it falls <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of veterinary medicine and therefore its use is not permitted.|$|E

25|$|For {{monitoring}} purposes, {{two categories}} were created: 1) improved sanitation and (2) unimproved sanitation. Open defecation falls <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of unimproved sanitation. This means {{that people who}} practice open defecation {{do not have access}} to improved sanitation.|$|E

25|$|By injecting {{different}} subjects {{into the}} Intuition/Deduction thesis, {{we are able}} to generate different arguments. Most rationalists agree mathematics is knowable by applying the intuition and deduction. Some go further to include ethical truths <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of things knowable by intuition and deduction. Furthermore, some rationalists also claim metaphysics is knowable in this thesis.|$|E

25|$|Tariana {{exhibits}} {{an essentially}} nominative–accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Its core cases are broadly analyzed as falling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>categories</b> of A/S 'subject' and non-A/S 'non-subject'.|$|R
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used robot configurations are articulated robots, SCARA robots, delta robots and cartesian coordinate robots, (gantry robots or x-y-z robots). In the context of general robotics, most types of robots would fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of robotic arms (inherent {{in the use of}} the word manipulator in ISO standard 1738).|$|E
25|$|Androgenic effects include {{maturation}} {{of the sex}} organs, {{particularly the}} penis {{and the formation of}} the scrotum in the fetus, and after birth (usually at puberty) a deepening of the voice, growth of facial hair (such as the beard) and axillary (underarm) hair. Many of these fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of male secondary sex characteristics.|$|E

50|$|Most {{versions}} of Microsoft Flight Simulator {{include some of}} the world's most popular aircraft from different <b>categories,</b> such as <b>the</b> Mooney Bravo and Beechcraft Baron 58, which fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> general aviation <b>category,</b> <b>the</b> Airbus A321 and Boeing 737, which fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> civil jets <b>category,</b> <b>the</b> Robinson R22, which falls <b>into</b> <b>the</b> helicopter <b>category,</b> <b>the</b> Air Scheffel 738, which falls <b>into</b> <b>the</b> general aviation <b>category</b> again, and many other planes commonly used around the world.|$|R
25|$|Conversely, if E is any exact {{category}}, we {{can take}} A to be the category of left-exact functors from E <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of abelian groups, which is itself abelian and in which E is a natural subcategory (via the Yoneda embedding, since Hom is left exact), stable under extensions, and in which a sequence is in E {{if and only if}} it is exact in A.|$|E
25|$|Sharpshooting: It is arguable {{that some}} {{firearms}} sharpshooting acts fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of impalement arts when they involve a performer holding up targets for a marksman. Even when sharpshooting is not performed as an impalement art, {{it is sometimes}} grouped alongside knife throwing as a wild west art. It also has {{much in common with}} crossbow shooting in terms of the accuracy skills involved.|$|E
25|$|While many psychoactive drugs clearly fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>category</b> {{of either}} stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogen, {{cannabis}} exhibits {{a mix of}} all properties, perhaps leaning the most towards hallucinogenic or psychedelic properties, though with other effects quite pronounced as well. THC is typically considered the primary active component of the cannabis plant; various scientific {{studies have suggested that}} certain other cannabinoids like CBD may also {{play a significant role in}} its psychoactive effects.|$|E

25|$|The French-American-British (FAB) {{classification}} system {{was published in}} 1976 to classify the leukaemias. It placed CMML <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of MDS, along with the refractory anaemia, refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts, refractory anaemia with excess blasts and refractory anaemia with excess blasts in transformation. The system does have clinical utility; however factors such as cytogenetic status are not within the remit of the classification. For this reason, many disease entities in these groups show {{a great deal of}} heterogeneity.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of algae that are intentionally cultivated fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of microalgae (also {{referred to as}} phytoplankton, microphytes, or planktonic algae). Macroalgae, commonly known as seaweed, also have many commercial and industrial uses, but due to their size and the specific requirements of {{the environment in which}} they need to grow, they do not lend themselves as readily to cultivation (this may change, however, with the advent of newer seaweed cultivators, which are basically algae scrubbers using upflowing air bubbles in small containers).|$|E
25|$|Like {{the steam}} engine, the Stirling engine is {{traditionally}} classified as an external combustion engine, as all heat transfers {{to and from}} the working fluid take place through a solid boundary (heat exchanger) thus isolating the combustion process and any contaminants it may produce from the working parts of the engine. This contrasts with an internal combustion engine where heat input is by combustion of a fuel within the body of the working fluid. Most of the many possible implementations of the Stirling engine fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of reciprocating piston engine.|$|E

25|$|Most astronomy-related {{astrobiology}} research falls <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of {{extrasolar planet}} (exoplanet) detection, the hypothesis being that if life arose on Earth, then {{it could also}} arise on other planets with similar characteristics. To that end, a number of instruments designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets have been considered, most notably NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) and ESA's Darwin programs, {{both of which have}} been cancelled. NASA launched the Kepler mission in March 2009, and the French Space Agency launched the COROT space mission in 2006. There are also several less ambitious ground-based efforts underway.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations Model Regulations on the Transportation of Dangerous Goods and {{national}} transportation authorities, such as United States Department of Transportation, have classified gunpowder (black powder) as a Group A: Primary explosive substance for shipment because it ignites so easily. Complete manufactured devices containing black powder are usually classified as Group D: Secondary detonating substance, or black powder, or article containing secondary detonating substance, such as firework, class D model rocket engine, etc., for shipment {{because they are}} harder to ignite than loose powder. As explosives, they all fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of Class 1.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a common}} sense of {{confusion}} between the difference of PTSD and a normal response to trauma. If an athlete injures himself or herself in a horrific way, it is normal {{for them to go}} through some adversity before overcoming the injury. They may develop small flashbacks, have bad dreams, or feel like they can't get the traumatic experience out of their mind, however, depending on the athlete’s mental ability, or how determined they are within their chosen sport, these symptoms can be lifted in time. Along with this, those athletes who are weaker mentally are the ones who tend to not be able to recover themselves and fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>category</b> of PTSD.|$|E
