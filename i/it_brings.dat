Both have up-and-down relationships with their two children: the intelligent-but-rebellious Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler), and underachiever A.J.

Ruiz contends that knowing the past is crucial to one's understanding of the present that takes us to postmodernism, and argues that The Feast of the Goat can thus be seen as a postmodern discourse that gives power to history recreation.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosperity}} theology {{teaching of}} positive confession stems from its proponents' view of scripture. The Bible {{is seen as}} a faith contract between God and believers; God is understood to be faithful and just, so believers must fulfill their end of the contract to receive God's promises. This leads to a belief in positive confession, the doctrine that believers may claim whatever they desire from God, simply by speaking it. Prosperity theology teaches that the Bible has promised prosperity for believers, so positive confession means that believers are speaking in faith what God has already spoken about them. Positive confession is practiced to bring about what is already believed in; faith itself is a confession, and speaking <b>it</b> <b>brings</b> it into reality.|$|E
5|$|Luther lists several criticisms {{advanced}} by laypeople against indulgences in theses 81–91. He presents these as difficult objections his congregants are bringing {{rather than his}} own criticisms. How should he answer those who ask why the pope does not simply empty purgatory {{if it is in}} his power? What should he say to those who ask why anniversary masses for the dead, which were for the sake of those in purgatory, continued for those who had been redeemed by an indulgence? Luther claimed that it seemed strange to some that pious people in purgatory could be redeemed by living impious people. Luther also mentions the question of why the pope, who is very rich, requires money from poor believers to build St. Peter's Basilica. Luther claims that ignoring these questions risks allowing people to ridicule the pope. He appeals to the pope's financial interest, saying that if the preachers limited their preaching in accordance with Luther's positions on indulgences (which he claimed was also the pope's position), the objections would cease to be relevant. Luther closes the Theses by exhorting Christians to imitate Christ even if <b>it</b> <b>brings</b> pain and suffering. Enduring punishment and entering heaven is preferable to false security.|$|E

5|$|The {{climate of}} Buenos Aires is {{dominated}} by the semi–permanent South Atlantic High throughout the year. This brings in moist winds from the northeast, which brings most of the precipitation to the city. During winter, <b>it</b> <b>brings</b> in frontal systems responsible for precipitation in the city. In autumn and summer, it produces storms that are generally located north of the city and produces strong winds from the south or southeast that can occasionally lead to the swelling of the Río de la Plata, flooding coastal areas. The South Pacific High is the origin of polar air masses that are responsible for the coldest temperatures and result in clear and very dry conditions. These air masses originate from the South Pacific high and move in a northeastern direction during winter towards Buenos Aires by passing. Although it is polar maritime (this is a cool, moist air mass that forms from oceans located in the subarctic and arctic regions at the southern tip of South America), it becomes modified as it passes over the South American continent, becoming drier as it arrives at Buenos Aires. This is because as the cold air masses from the South Pacific High move over the Pacific Ocean and the Andes and reach the land south of 35oS (where the Andes are shorter in height), anticyclogenesis leads to the formation of a strong high pressure system {{in the center of the}} country (at around 40oS). This high pressure system brings cold and dry, polar continental air masses to Buenos Aires. Cold fronts are more common during winter than in summer as the South Atlantic and South Pacific highs are at their southernmost positions during summer, making it difficult for cold fronts to enter.|$|E
