5|$|Flanagan's early {{influences}} included Art Tatum and Teddy Wilson, {{both of whom}} he <b>heard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{radio and}} playing in the Detroit area, as well as Nat King Cole and local pianists Earl Van Riper and Willie Anderson. These, however, played in an earlier style, and the young Flanagan {{and his friends were}} more interested in the newer bebop, including that played by pianist Bud Powell, who had a strong effect on Flanagan's musical thinking and improvising.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the official list of missing episodes, also missing is the original Episode 1 of The Daleks. At some point after the recording, {{it was discovered that}} a technical problem had caused backstage voices to be <b>heard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> resulting videotape; in early December 1963, the episode was remounted with a different costume for Susan. The only surviving portion is the reprise at the beginning of Episode 2.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{ends with}} Walter {{watching}} {{a video of}} Olivia as a child, apparently taken while she was being administered Cortexiphan. Walter's voice is <b>heard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tape, as is William Bell's. Both are trying to calm little Olivia while she sits, huddled amidst a debris-strewn room of equipment. It becomes clear Olivia has caused this chaos in Walter and Bell's lab, presumably with her Cortexiphan-induced abilities.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century as {{telephone}} lines became available, it became popular to add telegraph onto telephone lines with an earth return phantom circuit. An LC filter was required to prevent telegraph clicks being <b>heard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> telephone line. From the 1920s onwards, telephone lines, or balanced lines dedicated to the purpose, were used for FDM telegraph at audio frequencies. The first of these systems in the UK was a Siemens and Halske installation between London and Manchester. GEC and AT also had FDM systems. Separate pairs were used for the send and receive signals. The Siemens and GEC systems had six channels of telegraph in each direction, the AT system had twelve. All of these systems used electronic oscillators to generate a different carrier for each telegraph signal and required a bank of band-pass filters to separate out the multiplexed signal at the receiving end.|$|E

5|$|Eusèbe Jaojoby {{was born}} on 29 July 1955, {{in the village of}} Anboahangibe, near Sambava in the northeastern coastal Sava Region of Madagascar. Jaojoby and his twelve younger {{brothers}} and sisters were raised Catholic; early experiences singing hymns in the local church choir and traditional folk songs at local Betsimisaraka moonlight village festivals made him realize he possessed vocal talent. At the age of 15, Jaojoby's father sent him to continue his studies in Diego-Suarez, one of the six regional capitals at the time. The town was home to a large contingent of French soldiers and expatriates, and contemporary Western genres were commonly <b>heard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio and in the town's many nightclubs. Jaojoby was inspired by these styles and particularly by Freddy Ranarison, who in the 1960s became the first Malagasy musician to use an electric guitar to perform coastal musical styles.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, 2013, Webb {{announced}} that Hans Zimmer would be composing {{the music for}} the film, replacing James Horner, the composer of the first film. On October 25, 2013, Pharrell Williams revealed to Billboard that he would co-compose the score with Zimmer. Webb and Zimmer formed a supergroup with Williams, Johnny Marr, Mike Einziger and former Eurythmic, David A. Stewart, to create the music for the sequel. Eventually, Stewart {{did not participate in}} the film's music, and the supergroup, credited as The Magnificent Six (a reference to the Sinister Six) was composed of Williams, Marr, Einziger, Junkie XL, Steve Mazzaro and Andrew Kawczynski assisting Zimmer. The soundtrack for the film was released on April 22, 2014 by Columbia Records and Madison Gate Records. Hans Zimmer described his work for this film as different from previous works by him, thus revealing one of the themes for the film, which was first <b>heard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> website.|$|E
5|$|The Montalto faction {{transferred}} {{their support}} to Medici on 1 April, securing his election. Joyeuse had been seeking Medici's election throughout the conclave, and {{had managed to}} secure the support of Montalto for his candidate. Montalto was allied with the Spanish and had previously backed Tolomeo Gallio. After Medici's election, Avila revealed that Philip III had excluded Medici as well, and protested so loudly {{that he could be}} <b>heard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> street. The cardinals who had elected Medici answered that protesting the election of a candidate was useless once the person was elected pope. Upon his election, Medici took the name Leo XI in honour of his great-uncle Leo X. His election made Leo the fourth cardinal to be elected pope that had been created by Sixtus V in his consistory in 1583.|$|E

5|$|Zappa {{attempted}} {{to earn a}} living as a musician and composer, and played different nightclub gigs, some with {{a new version of the}} Blackouts. Zappa's earliest professional recordings, two soundtracks for the low-budget films The World's Greatest Sinner (1962) and Run Home Slow (1965) were more financially rewarding. The former score was commissioned by actor-producer Timothy Carey and recorded in 1961. It contains many themes that appeared on later Zappa records. The latter soundtrack was recorded in 1963 after the film was completed, but it was commissioned by one of Zappa's former high school teachers in 1959 and Zappa may have worked on it before the film was shot. Excerpts from the soundtrack can be <b>heard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> posthumous album The Lost Episodes (1996).|$|E
5|$|Offscreen, Mutual {{remained}} an enterprising broadcaster. In 1940, a program featuring Cedric Foster joined Mutual's respected schedule {{of news and}} opinion shows. Foster's claim to fame was as the first daytime commentator to be heard nationally on a daily basis. The network aired that year's NFL Championship Game on December 8, the first national broadcast of the annual event. Over the following half decade, Mutual's war coverage held its own {{with that of the}} wealthier networks, featuring field correspondents such as Henry Shapiro and Piet Van T Veer and commentators such as Cecil Brown, formerly of CBS. At 2:26p.m. Eastern time, on Sunday, December 7, 1941, Mutual flagship station WOR interrupted a football game broadcast with a news flash reporting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It was the first public announcement of the attack <b>heard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> U.S. mainland. The first bombs had dropped 63 minutes earlier. In May 1945, Sigrid Schultz reported from one of the last Nazi concentration camps to be discovered, Ravensbrück. The following month, Meet the Press premiered with Martha Rountree as moderator. For {{a year and a half}} in the late 1940s, William Shirer came over from CBS to do current events commentary after his famous falling out with Edward Murrow. In 1948, Mutual's four-part series To Secure These Rights, dramatizing the findings of President Truman's Committee on Civil Rights, outraged many politicians and the network's own affiliates in the segregated South.|$|E
5|$|That night, as Jack and Kate {{decide to}} search for the plane cockpit as its {{transceiver}} would allow the survivors to send a distress signal, loud roaring noises and crashing trees are heard in the nearby jungle. The following morning, the two are accompanied by Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) on their way into the jungle. The cockpit is found leaning against a tree, forcing the trio to climb it to reach the cabin. Charlie disappears into the bathroom while Jack and Kate awaken the concussed pilot (Greg Grunberg) in the cabin. The pilot tells them that the plane had lost radio contact six hours after take off, where it turned back for Fiji and hit wake turbulence. After estimating that the flight was 1,000 miles off course before it crashed, the pilot tries using the transceiver, but cannot get a signal. Suddenly the strange roaring noises <b>heard</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach the previous night return, and when the pilot investigates, he is seized by something outside and blood splatters on the window, prompting the trio to grab the transceiver and flee. During the escape, Charlie falls and Jack returns to help him, while a terrified Kate runs on. After the monster disappears, Kate, Charlie and Jack reunite and find the pilot's bloodied corpse suspended in a treetop.|$|E
