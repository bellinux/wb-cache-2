His wife pleads that her husband has not impregnated <b>her</b> <b>yet,</b> {{and that it is}} improper to kill a Brahmin. However, Kalmashapada devours the youth. The chaste Brahmin widow wails and curses Kalmashapada that he will die if he touches any woman with amorous intent. The wife cremates her husband and commits sati by jumping into his funeral pyre.|$|E
5|$|The two are arrested, and Nikki's funeral takes place. However, Samantha arrives {{to arrest}} Lillian, as Nikki's brother Billy (Eric Sheffer Stevens) found the pills Lillian wasn't giving Nikki, and Lillian {{is charged with}} interfering with her daughter’s medical care. Bill assures Megan that Nikki's money in her will, {{will be put to}} a good use and thanks her and the team for investigating. Throughout the {{investigation}} Lacey thinks that Megan and Todd are getting back together, as Todd has made many calls to Megan's work. Lacey is shocked to find out that Todd is not phoning Megan, but Kate, and the two are in a relationship. Megan is angry at Kate, but tells Lacey to respect her, even if she does not like <b>her</b> <b>yet.</b>|$|E
5|$|Davies {{wanted the}} Doctor to realise that Rose has {{something}} to offer to his cause. Their holding hands while running was meant to signify {{that they were a}} team, despite him not asking <b>her</b> <b>yet,</b> and they were not to question their relationship. The episode was intended to be presented from Rose's point-of-view. For audience identification purposes, Davies wanted the alien menace to be easily mistaken as human, so that it was possible for Rose to mistake the aliens for humans. Davies felt that {{there was no need to}} create a new monster, as the Autons met these criteria. The Auton sequences were difficult to film because the costumes were uncomfortable for the actors; which meant that frequent breaks from filming were needed. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used in post-production to cover up the zipper on the back of the necks of the Auton costumes. Davies wanted to recreate the scene of the Autons breaking out of shop windows from their first appearance in Spearhead from Space, although he had the budget to actually smash the glass instead of just cutting around it like in Spearhead.|$|E

25|$|Establishing the {{existence}} of a precontract between Catherine and Dereham would have had the effect of terminating Catherine's royal union, but it also would have allowed Henry to annul their marriage and banish her from Court, in poverty and disgrace, without having to execute <b>her.</b> <b>Yet</b> still she steadfastly denied any precontract, maintaining that Dereham had raped her.|$|E
25|$|A ring {{discovered}} {{is thought}} to show that Ankhesenamun married Ay shortly before she disappeared from history, although no monuments show her as a royal consort. On the walls of Ay's tomb it is Tey (Ay's senior wife), not Ankhesenamun, who appears as queen. She probably died during or shortly after his reign and no burial has been found for <b>her</b> <b>yet.</b>|$|E
25|$|Swanson {{made another}} film for RKO in 1941 (Father Takes a Wife), began {{appearing}} in the legitimate theater, and starred in her own television show in 1948. She threw herself into painting and sculpting, writing a syndicated column, touring in summer stock, engaging in political activism, radio and television work, clothing and accessories design and marketing, and making occasional appearances on the big screen. But {{it was not until}} 1950 when Sunset Boulevard was released (earning <b>her</b> <b>yet</b> another Academy Award nomination) that she achieved mass recognition again.|$|E

25|$|Mia admires Lilly's {{bravery and}} unwillingness {{to be pushed}} around by others though Lilly knows her {{insensitivity}} and forceful personality can cause her to be disliked. Mia and Lilly often enjoy discussing popular culture but Lilly's strong stances, however, cause her and Mia to clash, especially when Mia feels Lilly is becoming too critical of <b>her.</b> <b>Yet,</b> Lilly's blunt attitude is what often keeps Mia from over-analyzing things, such as her relationship with Michael, Lilly's older brother. Mia was initially afraid to share her crush on Michael with Lilly, but in fact, Lilly {{was one of the}} conspirators who helped Mia and Michael get together in Princess in Love.|$|E
25|$|The {{setting is}} symbolic. The beach—where {{land and sea}} meet—represents a place of transition. In earth's distant history creatures emerged from the sea to live on land, as Leslie and Sarah do {{in the course of}} the play. Changes for all four {{characters}} are taking place at the beach. Another symbol is the jet planes that zoom overhead. The jets are a mixed symbol. They are described to Sarah as the mechanical evolution of the seagulls that fascinate <b>her.</b> <b>Yet</b> Charlie worries that a jet will one day crash into the dune—a temporary if not symbolic end to evolution. The jets also scare both Sarah and Leslie. But the jets continue to fly and never crash, and the lizards decide to embrace their own evolution. Though feared by everyone but Nancy in Seascape, positive change holds as a symbolic theme of the play.|$|E
25|$|Ori and Sein {{come across}} two beings in their quest: Gumo, the last {{survivor}} of the spider-like Gumon clan and whose home supports the Wind element; and Kuro, a giant owl who is hostile toward Ori. Her hostility and the forest's cataclysm are explained in flashbacks. When Ori was lost, the Spirit Tree released {{a flash of light}} to look for them, which killed all of Kuro's recently hatched offspring. To prevent this from happening to <b>her</b> <b>yet</b> unborn child, Kuro took away the core on top of the Spirit Tree, which is actually Sein. Without the Spirit Tree's support, the three elements cannot be sustained, and Nibel lost its balance. As the element of Wind is rekindled, Gumo, realizing what Ori and Sein intend to do, uses his clan treasure that stores the light from the Spirit Tree to revive Naru, and takes her to where Ori is.|$|E

25|$|In 1899, Maria's second son, George, died of {{tuberculosis}} in the Caucasus. During the funeral, {{she kept her}} composure, {{but at the end}} of the service, she ran from the church clutching her son's top hat that been atop the coffin and collapsed in her carriage sobbing. Two years later, according to her daughter, Grand Duchess Olga, she arranged Olga's disastrous marriage to Peter, Duke of Oldenburg. For years Nicholas refused to grant his unhappy sister a divorce, only relenting in 1916 in the midst of the War. When Olga attempted to contract a morganatic marriage with Nikolai Kulikovsky, Maria Feodorovna and the tsar tried to dissuade <b>her,</b> <b>yet,</b> they did not protest too vehemently. Indeed, Maria Feodorovna was one of the few people who attended the wedding in November 1916. In 1912, Maria faced trouble with her youngest son, when he secretly married his mistress, much to the outrage and scandal of both Maria Feodorovna and Nicholas.|$|E

500|$|Moffat {{also brought}} back the {{character}} of River Song from his fourth series episodes [...] "Silence in the Library" [...] and [...] "Forest of the Dead". In the former, River asks the Doctor if he had done the [...] "crash of the Byzantium" [...] with <b>her</b> <b>yet.</b> Actress Alex Kingston did not expect the return, but stated that Moffat [...] "always intended that she would come back". Moffat was influenced by Audrey Niffenegger's novel, The Time Traveler's Wife, {{in which a woman}} {{falls in love with a}} man who unintentionally moves through time. Moffat used this inspiration in his episode [...] "The Girl in the Fireplace", but Alex Kingston, as well as reviewers have compared River to The Time Traveler's Wife.|$|E

500|$|Sugiyama {{has stated}} that Sasuke's line [...] "you are annoying" [...] sums up Sasuke's {{feelings}} towards Sakura. He is initially annoyed by <b>her,</b> <b>yet</b> when he repeats it before leaving Konohagakure, he is smiling. Naruto's voice actor, Junko Takeuchi, remarked that Sasuke's line [...] "See you next time… Thank you," [...] addressed to Sakura, revealed his feeling for her. Sugiyama noted that by the end, Sasuke realized how much he hurt Sakura's feelings across the series, and apologized to her after his final fight against Naruto. In preparations for the film , Sugiyama expected to see a bond between Sasuke and his student, Boruto. For the Boruto anime series, Sugiyama noted {{a major change in}} Sasuke's personality and he wanted fans to see the character's interaction with his family.|$|E
500|$|Other {{characters}} include Kirstie Alley as Saavik, Spock's protégée and a Starfleet commander-in-training {{aboard the}} Enterprise. The movie was Alley's first feature film role. Saavik cries during Spock's funeral. Meyer said that during filming someone asked him, [...] "'Are {{you going to}} let her do that?' And I said, 'Yeah,' and they said, 'But Vulcans don't cry,' and I said, 'Well, that's what makes this such an interesting Vulcan.'" [...] The character's emotional outbursts can be partly {{explained by the fact that}} Saavik was described as of mixed Vulcan-Romulan heritage in the script, though no indication is given on film. Alley was so fond of her Vulcan ears that she would take them home with her at the end of each day. Bibi Besch plays Carol Marcus, the lead scientist working on Project Genesis, and the mother of Kirk's son, David (played by Merritt Butrick). Meyer was looking for an actress who looked beautiful enough that it was plausible a womanizer such as Kirk would fall for <b>her,</b> <b>yet</b> who could also project a sense of intelligence. Meyer liked that Butrick's hair was blond like Besch's and curly like Shatner's, making him a plausible son of the two. John Winston reprises his series role as Kyle, the Enterprise transporter chief now Commander Kyle aboard Reliant.|$|E
500|$|... "Talking Heads" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. Of Kathy Searle's {{appearance as}} [...] "steely" [...] Irina, CelebrityNetWorth said, [...] "Searle impressively {{took on a}} Russian accent with flying colors in the series Body Of Proof". Orlando expressed her disappointment at John Carroll Lynch's character Bud Morris not appearing in this episode saying, [...] "The show lacked his sarcastic wit and his banter with Megan. We're just a few episode's into this show and I've already been enjoying their chemistry". She also praised Searle's performance saying, [...] "When Irina described cutting up Callum's body it was with an eerie coldness. She liked the man and he cared for <b>her.</b> <b>Yet,</b> once dead {{he was no longer}} an asset to her but a problem that needed to be disposed of, literally. I could only imagine the parts of yourself you'd have to shut down {{to be able to take}} a hacksaw to someone you were fond of". Also praising Kelly AuCoin's performance, she said that she wasn't [...] "sure who was more disturbing, Irina or the landlord who swung a hammer at the man's head and then went on with his day as though nothing had occurred". Finally, she praised the scenes between Megan and Lacey (Mary Mouser).|$|E

500|$|Clayton [...] "Jonesy" [...] Jones is an ex-baseball {{player who}} suffers from a {{crippling}} knee injury. He is Samson's right-hand man, operator of the Ferris wheel, {{and the leader of}} the roustabouts. Jonesy's original biography reveals his past as a star pitcher in the major league whose knee was injured in revenge when he refused to throw a game for the mob. Slipping to the edge of society, Jonesy joined the Carnivàle and found redemption in the eyes of young Sofie. The two became inseparable until Sofie grew into a woman, making their relationship awkward. At the beginning of the series, Jonesy is faced with Sofie avoiding his advances. While she retreats into a friendship with cootch dancer Libby Dreifuss, Jonesy finds sexual relief with Libby's mother Rita Sue. When Sofie begins to show interest in him, he breaks off his relationship with Rita Sue; however, {{the fact that he was}} sleeping with her (and that Libby knew about it) causes Sofie to break both of their hearts as pay back. After this Jonesy remains cold towards <b>her</b> <b>yet</b> finds new affection in Libby. The two eventually elope. Jonesy is kidnapped, tortured and left for dead by a man who had lost his wife in a Ferris wheel accident. Ben is able to heal Jonesy including his crippled knee, and Jonesy joins Ben on his last mission. In the series' final minutes, Jonesy and Sofie meet again, and she shoots him in cold blood.|$|E
500|$|Jon Pareles of The New York Times {{compared}} the DVD with Taylor Swift's [...] which aired {{as a special}} {{the same day as}} I Am... World Tour. He noted, [...] "Beyoncé's I Am... World Tour placed her before much larger audiences, documenting her choreographed razzle-dazzle as she played arenas and stadiums in 2009-10." [...] He further said, [...] "Beyoncé didn't explain: she performed. With costumes that made her a comic-book heroine, a cyborg, a club hottie, and a white-clad vision of purity, she worked her big stages with hip-pumping moves and a soul diva's voice, from creamy to raspy. The documentary quietly flaunted her consistency as a trouper in montages that segued multiple shows — supertitled in small type — with Beyoncé in the same outfit making the same moves, while the fans' nationalities changed around <b>her.</b> <b>Yet</b> for all her superhuman pep, she also came across as warmer than Ms. Swift. She grinned knowingly after belting a phrase into the bleachers, and she drew listeners into her own pop generalities. Andy Gill of The Independent was much less impressed with the DVD, qualifying it as an [...] "unsatisfying, incoherent entertainment experience" [...] even though she liked the way [...] "the visual spectacle put everything in perspective". The concert film received a nomination for a NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Variety – Series or Special in 2011. I Am... World Tour was nominated in the category for Best Long Form Music Video at the 54th Grammy Awards, held on February 12, 2012.|$|E
