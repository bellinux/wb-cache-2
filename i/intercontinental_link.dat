Considering that the e-broker is used by a large number of users that only speak Portuguese and live in Brazil, we discuss the influence of regional and cultural issues on the e-commerce activities. Although the Web opens a company to a global market, our findings clearly indicate that e-commerce is strongly tied to regional issues, such as language, national customs and regulations, currency conversion and logistics.

40|$|The {{precision}} of time transfer over intercontinental distances by the Global Positioning System common-view method, using measurements of ionospheric delays, precise ephemerides {{provided by the}} Defense Mapping Agency (DMA) and a consistent set of antenna coordinates, reaches 3 to 4 ns for a single 13 -minute measurement, and decreases to 2 ns when averaging several measurements over the period of one day. It is thought that even this level of precision can be bettered by improving the ionospheric measurements, the ephemerides of satellites, and the antenna coordinates. In the same conditions, an estimation of the accuracy is attained by using three <b>intercontinental</b> <b>links</b> encircling the Earth to establish a closure condition; the three independent links should add to zero.

40|$|Abstract—Two-way {{satellite}} {{time and}} frequency transfer (TWSTFT) is the technique which allows time scale comparisons at the nanosecond level. Until now, this uncertainty level {{is restricted to}} those institutes which both can exchange signals through the same single transponder of one telecommunication satellite. Only {{in this case the}} calibration scheme of circulating a portable TWSTFT reference station is applicable. This condition is not fulfilled in the operational <b>intercontinental</b> <b>links,</b> e. g. between Asia and Europe. Calibration of the TWSTFT link is in such cases achieved by adjusting the TWSTFT results to those obtained with a calibrated GPS link. The uncertainty is then limited by the uncertainty of the GPS link, which is commonly estimated to be at the level uB = 5 ns. We propose an experimental configuration which allows determination of all important delay differences in a long baseline link including the differential delays between the operational ground stations as well as the differential transponder delay between the two separated transponders used on the satellite. The latter has never been determined on a flying satellite. We propose to exchange two portable TWSTFT stations and two GPS receivers between the two ground stations to be calibrated. We estimate the overall uncertainty for the calibration to be at a level of 2 ns. We also discuss briefly the ability of calibrating a TWSTFT link as a whole by means of GPS on the same level of uncertatinty. I...|$|R

40|$|Wide area {{networks}} of increasing end-to-end capacity and capability are vital for every phase of high energy physicists' work. Our bandwidth usage, and the typical {{capacity of the}} major national backbones and <b>intercontinental</b> <b>links</b> used by our field have progressed {{by a factor of}} several hundred times over the past decade. With the opening of the LHC era in 2009 - 10 and the prospects for discoveries in the upcoming LHC run, the outlook is for a continuation or an acceleration of these trends using next generation networks over the next few years. Responding to the need to rapidly distribute and access datasets of tens to hundreds of terabytes drawn from multi-petabyte data stores, high energy physicists working with network engineers and computer scientists are learning to use long range networks effectively on an increasing scale, and aggregate flows reaching the 100 Gbps range have been observed. The progress of the LHC, and the unprecedented ability of the experiments to produce results rapidly using worldwide distributed data processing and analysis has sparked major, emerging changes in the LHC Computing Models, which are moving from the classic hierarchical model designed a decade ago to more agile peer-to-peer-like models that make more effective use of the resources at Tier 2 and Tier 3 sites located throughout the world. A new requirements working group has gauged the needs of Tier 2 centers, and charged the LHCOPN group that runs the network interconnecting the LHC Tierls with designing a new architecture interconnecting the Tier 2 s. As seen from the perspective of ICFA's Standing Committee on Inter-regional Connectivity (SCIC), the Digital Divide that separates physicists in several regions of the developing world from those in the developed world remains acute, although many countries have made major advances through the rapid installation of modern network infrastructures.

40|$|Failure {{detection}} is {{a fundamental}} building block for ensuring fault tolerance in distributed systems. However, providing accurate and flexible failure detection in off-the-shelf distributed systems is difficult. Practical solutions to failure detection rely on some adaptive mechanism {{to cope with the}} unpredictability of networking conditions. However, while they provide reasonably good accuracy, they also lack the necessary flexibility to provide failure detection as a system-wide service. In particular, traditional solutions take a “one size fits all ” approach, which prevents them from simultaneously supporting several distributed applications with very diverse QoS requirements. In this paper, we present a novel approach to adaptive failure detection, called ϕ-failure detector, which ad-dresses the flexibility issue mentioned above. We describe an implementation, and analyze its behavior over <b>intercontinental</b> communication <b>links</b> during several weeks.

40|$|One of {{the most}} obvious {{challenges}} facing the Internet can be observed every day when surfing the Web. As people start their working day, the application-level performance of the Web decreases drastically as the infrastructure of the WWW had not been designed for the huge amount of users. Caching is a standard solution {{for this kind of}} problem, which is why the current situation of caching in the WWW forms the initial part of this paper. As several issues are shown to remain, the more advanced concept of replication and naming is presented afterwards. It is shown that the latter not only helps to reduce the overall bandwidth as well as user-perceived latency, but that a more fault-tolerant and more evenly balanced system results. The presented system, CgR/WLIS, is shown to be realizable in a transparent and backward compatible manner as compared to the installed base of WWW software. TODAY’S WEB A few years ago, the notion of an Information Superhighway has been envisioned. Today, it is beginning to become a reality—including traffic jams as on conventional (motor) highways. The fortunate message is that anyone having access to the Internet may potentially profit from the vast amount of information available. Due to the fact that most members of the still growing Internet community surf the Web at daytime, we are faced with the problem of network congestion at those times. Low bandwidth, especially for <b>intercontinental</b> <b>links,</b> is the immediate consequence. The user itself experiences high latencies. The problems become even more serious when looking at the hot pages of the day. One major difficulty arises due to the most common case that all requests of all users have to be served by a single machine. In this single-server approach, the Web server becomes a bottleneck. Even worse, if this machine fails, the access path to the information is lost. There is a single point of failure. Therefore, solutions for a couple of interrelated problems have to be come up with in order to preserve the usability of the World Wide Web: Decrease document retrieval latenc...|$|R

40|$|Detecting {{failures}} is {{a fundamental}} issue for fault-tolerance in distributed systems. Recently, many {{people have come to}} realize that failure detection ought to be provided as some form of generic service, similar to IP address lookup or time synchronization. However, this has not been successful so far. One of the reasons is the difficulty to satisfy several application requirements simultaneously when using classical failure detectors. We present a novel abstraction, called accrual failure detectors, that emphasizes flexibility and expressiveness and can serve as a basic building block to implementing failure detectors in distributed systems. Instead of providing information of a boolean nature (trust vs. suspect), accrual failure detectors output a suspicion level on a continuous scale. The principal merit of this approach is that it favors a nearly complete decoupling between application requirements and the monitoring of the environment. In this paper, we describe an implementation of such an accrual failure detector, that we call the ϕ failure detector. The particularity of the ϕ failure detector is that it dynamically adjusts to current network conditions the scale on which the suspicion level is expressed. We analyzed the behavior of our ϕ failure detector over an <b>intercontinental</b> communication <b>link</b> during several days. Our experimental results show that our ϕ failure detector performs equally well as other known adaptive failure detection mechanisms, with an improved flexibility. I...|$|R
40|$|This report {{gives an}} {{overview}} of the status and outlook for the world's research networks and major international links used by the high energy physics and other scientific communities, network technology advances on which our community depends and in which we have an increasingly important role, and the problem of the Digital Divide, which is a primary focus of ICFA's Standing Committee on Inter-regional Connectivity (SCIC). Wide area networks of sufficient, and rapidly increasing end-to-end capability are vital for every phase of high energy physicists' work. Our bandwidth usage, and the typical capacity of the major national backbones and <b>intercontinental</b> <b>links</b> used by our field have progressed by a factor of more than 1000 over the past decade, and the outlook is for a similar increase over the next decade. This striking exponential growth trend, outstripping the growth rates in other areas of information technology, has continued in the past year, with many of the major national, continental and transoceanic networks supporting research and education progressing from a 10 Gigabits/sec (Gbps) backbone to multiple 10 Gbps links in their core. This is complemented by the use of point-to-point “light paths” to support the most demanding applications, including high energy physics, in a growing list of cases. As we approach the era of LHC physics, the growing need to access and transport Terabyte-scale and later 10 to 100 Terabyte datasets among more than 100 “Tier 1 ” and “Tier 2 ” centers at universities and laboratories spread throughout the world has brought the key role of networks, and the ongoing need for their development, sharply into focus. Bandwidth itself on an increasing scale is not enough. Realizing the scientific wealth of the LHC and our other major scientific programs depends crucially on our ability to use the bandwidth efficiently and reliably, with reliable high rates of data throughput, and effectively, where many parallel large-scale data transfers serving the community complete with high probability, often while coexisting with many other streams of network traffic. Responding to these needs, and to the scientific mission, physicists working with network engineers and computer scientists have made substantial progress in the development of protocols and systems that promise to meet these needs, placing our community among the world leaders in the development as well as use of large-scale networks. A great deal of work remains, and is continuing. As we advance in these areas, often (as in the past year) with great rapidity, there is a growing danger that we will leave behind our collaborators in regions with less-developed networks, or with regulatory frameworks or business models that put the required networks financially out of reach. This threatens to further open the Digital Divide that already exists among the regions of the world. In 2002, the SCIC recognized the threat that this Divide represents to our global scientific collaborations, and since that time has worked assiduously to reduce or eliminate it; both within our community, and more broadly in the world research community of which HEP is a part...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It {{is pointed}} out that the {{classical}} propagation model can be in accord with the Sagnac effect due to earth’s rotational and orbital motions in the high-precision GPS (global positioning system) and inter-planetary radar, if the reference frame of the classical propagation medium is endowed with a switchability according to the location of the wave. Accordingly, it is postulated that, as in the obsolete theory, electro-magnetic waves propagate via a medium like the ether. However, the ether is not universal. It is proposed that in the region under sufficient influence of the gravity due to the earth, the sun, or another celestial body, there forms a local ether, which in turn is stationary with respect to the gravitational potential of the respective body. For earthbound and interplanetary propagation, the medium is stationary in a geocentric and a heliocentric inertial frame, respectively. An electromagnetic wave propagates at a constant speed with respect to the associated local ether, independent of the motions of source and receiver. Based on this local-ether model of wave propagation, a wide variety of earthbound, interplanetary, and interstellar propagation phenomena are accounted for. Strong evidence of this new classical model is its consistent account of the Sagnac effect due to earth’s motions among GPS, the <b>intercontinental</b> microwave <b>link,</b> and the interplanetary radar. Moreover, as examined within the present precision, this model is still in accord with the Michelson–Morley experiment. To test the local-ether propagation model, a one-way-link rotor experiment is proposed. ...|$|R
40|$|For {{more than}} a decade meteorologists at the German Antarctic {{research}} station Neumayer (70 °S, 008 °W) offer detailed and individual summer weather forecasts for all activities in the Dronning Maud Land. Especially the <b>intercontinental</b> air <b>link</b> with Cape Town made the establishment of this service mandatory. The work is performed in close cooperation between the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) and the German Weather Service (DWD). The forecasts base mainly on in situ data including automatic weather stations (AWS), on near real time satellite pictures and on a variety of model products mainly from the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). To optimize this service the errors of a typical AWS had been quantified by running an unmaintained AWS one year side by side of the maintained instruments from the meteorological observatory from Neumayer. In a second year the same AWS was placed 11 km north of Neumayer to judge the spatial footprint of the observatory data. By comparing model products with the measurements of the observatory systematic errors in the forecast products have been observed. Also the ERA-Interim reanalysis differs significantly from the temperature time series observed at Neumayer {{despite the fact that the}} data is fed into the Global Telecommunication System GTS for more than 30 years. From these findings some guidance on optimizing the Antarctic observing and prediction systems could be developed. ...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{significance}} of the Collins 2 ̆ 7 Overland Telegraph or Western Union Russian Extension is as a chapter {{in the history of}} communications. A pioneer attempt to establish telegraphic communications between North America and Europe, via Bering Strait, the Collins* Overland Project was ultimately a failure. The successful laying of an Atlantic cable by Cyrus Field in 1866 removed the basic raison d etre of the overland route and led to the halting of construction. While a failure {{in the sense that the}} project did not succeed in establishing an <b>intercontinental</b> communications <b>link,</b> it did bring important secondary benefits to both British Columbia and Alaska. It was, in other words, a relatively successful failure. In British Columbia mining and exploration were stimulated and the internal communications system of the colony vastly improved. In Alaska the telegraph expeditions were responsible for the first systematic examination of the flora, fauna and geology of the area. Members of the telegraph project were thus able to play a minor but significant role in the purchase of Alaska by providing much useful data on the valuable new territory. The study of the Collins 1 Overland scheme was made easier by the literacy of the members of the project. The many unpublished papers and diaries as well as published memoirs which survived the scheme form the basis for the thesis.
