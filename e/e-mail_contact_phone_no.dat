40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Presentation date: 2005 - 11 - 29 The current project {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} three life transitions on the intimacy and contact siblings share in early adulthood. Using a web-based survey, 260 young adults from two large state universities and community members from the Portland, Oregon area were surveyed about their relationships with a single biological sibling. Participants were asked {{a series of questions}} concerning three life transitions (transition out of the parental home, transition to marriage or intimate partnership, and the transition to parenthood), <b>contact</b> (<b>e-mail,</b> <b>phone,</b> and personal), and sibling intimacy. Participants were also asked open-ended questions based on their responses to quantitative questions. A series of hierarchical linear regressions identified that sister-sister pairs were associated with the greatest levels of <b>e-mail,</b> <b>phone,</b> and personal <b>contact,</b> followed by the sister-brother, brother-sister, and brother-brother pairs. The gender of sibling pairs was not found to have an influence on the intimacy siblings shared. Coresidential status showed little to no influence on the intimacy and <b>e-mail</b> <b>contact</b> siblings shared, indicating that intimacy and <b>e-mail</b> <b>contact</b> {{did not appear to be}} influenced by the transition away from home for siblings. The <b>phone</b> and personal <b>contact</b> was however, significant with the transition away from home. The intimate relationship status of sibling pairs had little to no influence on the intimacy and <b>phone</b> <b>contact</b> shared by siblings. As predicted, those pairs in which both the participant and the sibling were single showed the greatest <b>e-mail</b> and personal <b>contact.</b> When looking at the transition to parenthood, <b>e-mail</b> <b>contact</b> was not influenced by the transition to parenthood, but childless sibling pairs identified the greatest levels of sibling intimacy and personal contact compared to all other pairs. <b>Phone</b> <b>contact</b> was the lowest for sibling pairs in which both the siblings were parents. Open-ended data offered a different explanation of the intimacy and contact between siblings. Feedback from participants indicated that intimacy was something that possibly remained consistent across gender and life transitions, even with a drop in personal, <b>phone,</b> and email <b>contact.</b> Implications and future directions were also explored...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: There {{exists a}} growing {{consensus}} that career flexibility {{is critical to}} recruiting and retaining talented faculty, especially women faculty. This {{study was designed to}} determine both accessibility and content of work-life policies for faculty at leading medical schools in the United States. Methods: The sample includes the top ten medical schools in the United States published by U. S. News and World Report in August 2006. We followed a standardized protocol to collect seven work-life policies at each school: maternity leave, paternity leave, adoption leave, extension of the probationary period for family re-sponsibilities, part-time faculty appointments, job sharing, and child care. A review of information provided on school websites was followed by <b>e-mail</b> or <b>phone</b> <b>contact</b> if needed. A rating system of 0 – 3 (low to high flex-ibility) developed by the authors was applied to these policies. Rating reflected flexibility and existing opin-ions in published literature. Results: Policies were often difficult to access. Individual scores ranged from 7 to 15 out of a possible 21 points. Extension of the probationary period received the highest cumulative score across schools, and job sharing re-ceived the lowest cumulative score. For each policy, there were important differences among schools. Conclusions: Work-life policies showed considerable variation across schools. Policy information is difficult to access, often requiring multiple sources. Institutions that develop flexible work-life policies that are widely pro-moted, implemented, monitored, and reassessed are likely at an advantage in attracting and retaining faculty while advancing institutional excellence. 131...|$|R

30|$|The {{first step}} {{consisted}} of sending <b>e-mails</b> to <b>contact</b> persons at different research institutions within the Nordic countries (i.e., Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) {{as outlined in}} [41]. Based on this <b>e-mail</b> <b>contact,</b> the list was further modified (e.g., adding University of Vaasa in Finland and Linnaeus University and Örebro University School of Business in Sweden). The final list included 39 research institutions which are presented in “Appendix 1.” A contact person {{at each of the}} 39 research institution was identified and was <b>contacted</b> by <b>e-mail.</b> The e-mail provided a clear statement of the research project and requested the list of completed doctoral dissertations within logistics and SCM within the analysis period. This process provided an initial list of 120 dissertations. Majority of these dissertations were accessible in electronic form (we either received them by e-mail or downloaded them from the corresponding institution’s Web site). The rest of the dissertations were available in hard copy form.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcomes of a computer-assisted intervention for eating disorders based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The six-week intervention program was delivered through Internet, and it consisted of a webpage including information and exercises, and a personal <b>e-mail</b> <b>contact.</b> The aim was to study whether this kind of treatment method could be applicable in treatment of eating disorders and whether it would yield clinically significant outcomes in participants’ psychopathology and quality of life. Another matter of interest was how the participants would accept a computer-assisted intervention, what kind of experiences they would have after the treatment, and how the program could be developed in the future. According to this study computer-assisted intervention {{can be an effective}} form of treatment for patients, whose motivational level and stage of the disorder are suitable for self-reliant working. Some personal support is however needed, and the participants of this study shared the opinion that the <b>e-mail</b> <b>contact</b> was a very essential part of the treatment. The best results were attained together with a contact ACT-therapy. The results showed that the participants, who had the most active contact with the therapist and who spent the most time doing the exercises, benefited the most from the program. Altogether the program was found to be feasible and easy to deliver for patients across the country...|$|R
