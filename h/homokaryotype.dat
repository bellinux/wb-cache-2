40|$|The seaweed fly, Coelopa frigida, {{lives in}} piles of rotting seaweed {{deposited}} on beaches by tides and winds. In all populations studied it is polymorphic for two gene arrangements on Chromosome I. A polymorphism at the alcohol dehydrogenase locus is {{strongly associated with}} this inversion {{and can be used}} to estimate karyotype frequencies. An extensive series of samples from natural populations has revealed a seasonal cycle in inversion frequencies but otherwise frequencies are remarkable constant both geographically and temporally. There is a consistent excess of heterokaryotypes in these samples. Three selective forces influencing inversion frequencies have been investigated. 1) An association between karyotype and development time, previously observed in the laboratory, has been demonstrated in conditions case to those in natural populations. 2) Viability differences between karyotypes have been examined. In natural populations {{there is some evidence that}} the excess of heterokaryotypes increases with larval density. In the laboratory heterokaryotypes are shown to have higher viability than either <b>homokaryotype</b> but the strong density dependence reported previously has not been observed. Viability differences are concentrated in the first two days of larval life and are probably related to the rate of supply of nutrients. 3) An association is demonstrated between karyotype and adult size – especially in males. Adult size is shown to correlate with longevity and fecundity of both sexes. Several experiments indicate that large males enjoy greater mating success than small males. The relationship between larval density, development time and adult size is described. The possibility that the effect of the inversion varies between populations or between alcohol dehydrogenase genotypes has also been investigated. A simulation has been used to study how these selective forces interact with one another, and with the changeable environment in which the flies live, and to examine the extent to which they can account for the observed karyotype frequencies...|$|E
40|$|In {{a natural}} {{population}} of Drosophila persimilis (McDonald Ranch, Napa Valley, California), KL and MD chromosomal arrangement frequencies undergo a seasonal cycle, with MD common {{in spring and}} KL common in summer. Samples collected from spring and summer provided isofemale strains established as homozygous KL and MD pairs (kinlines) with each pair derived from a single heterokaryotype wild progenitor. Haploid doses of chromosomes 2 and 4 were controlled by marker-cross derivations of kinlines. Percentage onset of female receptivity was measured from cultures at 25 ° and at 15 °, using ten kinlines from spring and nine from summer collections, with fast-mating hybrid males as standard testers. Mating tests consisted of 20 tester males x 20 females of specific age, karyotype, and kinline observed for 30 min. At 25 ° females became receptive at 48 hr after eclosion: parental line (KLi/KLi and MDi/MDi) females were approximately equal at 55 to 60 % receptive, while among hybrids, MDi/MDj <b>homokaryotype</b> females were significantly less receptive (68 %) than all other outbred combinations (73 to 77 %). At 15 °, females became receptive at four days of age, with increases on the fifth and sixth days: both parental line and outbred MD/MD females were significantly more receptive (28 % at four days and 62 % at six days) than all heterokaryotype females (20 to 26 % at four days and 55 to 59 % at six days), which in turn were more receptive than KL/KL parental and outbred females (10 % at four days and 40 % at six days). Heterosis was expressed at 25 °, but not at 15 °. Thus, dominance for female receptivity was temperature dependent. Females polymorphic for these third chromosomal karyotypes possess differential temperature sensitivity for onset of receptivity {{and are likely to}} contribute in a significant way to the observed seasonal frequency cycle in the natural population from which they have been derived...|$|E
40|$|Propensity {{to blood}} feeding under {{laboratory}} conditions was studied in females of A. stephensi carriers of different arrangements of a polymorphic paracentric inversion of chromosome 2 R (+/+, +/b, b/b). One hour experiments were performed at various {{hours of the}} day, in continuous light, with temperature between 26 and 28 degrees C and relative humidity between 65 and 75 %, using unfed mosquitoes 4 - 5 days old and guinea pigs as hosts. The frequency of blood fed females {{was found to be}} constantly much lower in the +/+ <b>homokaryotypes,</b> than in the other two karyotypes. Smaller differences in biting activity were observed between the heterokaryotypes and the b/b <b>homokaryotypes,</b> the latter appearing significantly more active at least during the scotophase hours. The evidence of a lower activity of the +/+ <b>homokaryotypes</b> was confirmed when the mosquitoes were stimulated by a human arm. Such marked and constant behavioural difference is tentatively considered as the expression of a diversified response to the environmental conditions whose deterrent effect on biting activity would be more pronounced on the +/+ <b>homokaryotypes</b> than on the carriers of the 2 Rb arrangement...|$|R
40|$|Conditions for {{protected}} inversion polymorphism {{under the}} operation of both karyotype and supergene selection in a viability model have been analytically determined. When supergene selection (the effect of recombination in <b>homokaryotypes</b> lowering the mean fitness of their offspring) is acting on gene arrangements {{and there is no}} karyotype selection, it is demonstrated that a polymorphic stable equilibrium is reached by the population, which is a function of only the recombination effects in <b>homokaryotypes.</b> Under both supergene and karyotype selection the degree of dominance (h) of karyotype selection is critical to produce a protected inversion polymorphism. In general, the opportunity for protected polymorphism increases as the degree of dominance decreases. For small s values, the conditions for protected polymorphism are r > 2 sh and c > 2 s(h - 1), where r and c are the average loss of viability for offspring of ST/ST and IN/IN <b>homokaryotypes,</b> respectively. These findings suggest that supergene selection may be an important balancing mechanism contributing to the maintenance of inversion polymorphism...|$|R
40|$|In the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, {{alternative}} {{arrangements of}} chromosome 2 (2 La and 2 L+a) vary in relative frequency along clines of aridity, suggesting {{the action of}} natural selection on targets within the inversion. Our long term goal of detecting such targets depends {{in part on the}} level of genetic exchange between arrangements. Accordingly, we estimated recombination rates on 2 L from the backcross progeny of 2 La/+a heterokaryotypes and as a control, from 2 L+a <b>homokaryotypes.</b> In <b>homokaryotypes,</b> the recombination rate was uniform at ~ 2. 0 centimorgans per megabase (cM/Mb). In heterokaryotypes, recombination within the rearranged region was reduced to < 0. 5 cM/Mb, with slightly higher but nevertheless reduced levels (< 1. 0 cM/Mb) flanking the rearrangement. Yet, gene exchange was recorded between nearly all markers, including those very near the distal inversion breakpoint. These results suggest that reduced recombination is a necessary but not sufficient mechanism for genetic isolation between alternative arrangements, and that the targets of natural selection can be identified against the different chromosomal backgrounds...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{work has}} called into {{question}} {{the reality of the}} rare male mating advantage, pointing out that it could be a statistical artifact of marking flies for behavioral observation or of experimental bias in collecting males. We designed an experiment to test for rare male mating advantage that avoids these sources of bias. Large numbers of males of three Drosophila pseudoobscura karyotypes were allowed to mate with females of one karyotype in population cages. The females were then isolated before multiple mating occurred and their progeny used to diagnose the males that mated them. Populations were studied at five sets of male karyotypic frequencies. The mating success of the male <b>homokaryotypes</b> ST/ST and CH/CH, relative to that of the heterokaryotype ST/CH, was frequency dependent. Both ST/ST and CH/CH males displayed a statistically significant mating advantage at low frequency by comparision with their mating success in the midrange of karyotypic frequencies. Both male <b>homokaryotypes</b> also showed a significantly greater mating success at high homokaryotypic frequency than at intermediate frequencies, which is the same as saying that the heterokaryotype not only failed to show a rare male advantage but actually suffered a mating disadvantage at low frequency. We conclude that rare male mating advantage is not always an experimental or methodological artifact but does occur in laboratory populations of D. pseudoobscura. It may occur for some genotypes and not for others, however, and it may be only one of several forms of frequency-dependent mating behavior operating in a population...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Female seaweed flies, Coelopa frigida, {{have the}} {{potential}} to benefit from mating more than once. Single matings result in low fertility so females may benefit directly from multiple copulations by sperm replenishment. A chromosomal inversion associated with larval fitness, with heterokaryotypic larvae having higher viability than <b>homokaryotypes,</b> means that polyandrous homokaryotypic females have a higher probability of producing genetically fit offspring than monandrous homokaryotypic females. We allowed females to mate only once, repeatedly four times to the same male, or polyandrously four times to four different males. Multiply mated and polyandrous females laid more eggs and produced more offspring than singly mated and monandrous females, respectively. Polyandrous females laid more eggs, had higher egg-to-adult surviva...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to analyse the pattern of mating and to look for sexual selection differences among karyotypes of Drosophila subobscura. This was done by assaying the mating structure of large experimental populations of this species set up with different frequencies of °ST and 034 ± 7 chromosomal arrangements. From the experimental results, it is concluded that the mating pattern is at random and that the mating success of the male <b>homokaryotypes</b> °ST'°ST and 03 ÷ 4 ÷ 7 / 03 ÷ 4 ÷ 7, relative {{to that of the}} heterokaryotype °ST'° 3 + 4 + 7, is frequency-dependent favouring the rare male. These results are discussed in connection with the stable equilibrium attained in experimental population cages containing the °ST and 03 ÷ 47 chromosomal arrangements...|$|R
40|$|In(2 LR) PL {{is a large}} pericentric {{inversion}} polymorphic in populations of Drosophila melanogaster on two Indian Ocean islands. This polymorphism is puzzling: because crossing over in female heterokaryotypes produces inviable zygotes, such inversions {{are thought to be}} underdominant and should be quickly eliminated from populations. The observed fixation for such inversions among related species has led to the idea that genetic drift can cause chromosome evolution in opposition to natural selection. We found, however, that In(2 LR) PL is not underdominant for fertility, as heterokaryotypic females produce perfectly viable eggs. Genetic analysis shows that the lack of underdominance results from the nearly complete absence of crossing over in the inverted region. This phenomenon is probably caused by mechanical and not genetic factors, because crossing over is not suppressed in In(2 LR) PL <b>homokaryotypes.</b> Our observations do not support the idea that the fixation of {{pericentric inversion}}s among closely related species implies the action of genetic drift overcoming strong natural selection in very small populations. If chromosome arrangements vary in their underdominance, it is those with the least disadvantage as heterozygotes, like In(2 LR) PL, that will be polymorphic or fixed in natural populations...|$|R
40|$|Arrowhead (AR) third {{chromosome}} {{arrangements of}} Drosophila pseudoobscura, whose competitive fitnesses had been determined in population cages, were tested for their genetic loads in homozygous, heterozygous (homokaryotypic), and heterokaryotypic (AR/CH) combinations. The {{results showed that}} their competitive population cage performances were correlated to their viabilities as homozygotes but were not correlated to their viabilities as heterozygotes or as heterokaryotypes. However, the results do not fit in too simply with the mutational model of population structure, since the improvement of homozygous viability with increased competitive fitness was not accompanied by a significant degree of dominance {{as measured by the}} regression of viabilities of heterozygotes on homozygotes. Only the AR chromosomes derived from the population with poorest competitive fitness showed marked partial dominance (h=. 35). The viabilities of heterokaryotypes were markedly uniform for all chromosomes tested and produced significantly greater numbers of flies per culture than the <b>homokaryotypes.</b> In general, the results show that the ranking of relative competitive fitnesses of these chromosomes is not a simple extrapolation of their viabilities, although marked changes in the populations tested have occurred. It is proposed that the differences in competitive fitness, homozygous viability, and degree of dominance observed among these chromosomes, arise from differences in genetic variability which enable different linkage relationships to be established for genes affecting these attributes...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{of strong}} {{associations}} of Est- 1 alleles with the 2 L, 2 L 1 and 2 L 3 gene arrangements {{of the left}} arm of the second chromosome in D. robusta is presented. Each gene arrangement is polymorphic {{for three to four}} Est- 1 alleles. The allele frequencies differ in the 2 L 3 and 2 L arrangements; the allele Est- 1. 92 is 8 % in the 2 L 3 arrangement (n= 203) —this allele is 82 % in the 2 L arrangement (n= 203); the allele Est- 11. 0 is 66 % and 14. 8 % in the 2 L 3 and 2 L arrangements, respectively. There are no differences in allele frequencies in 2 L 3 arrangements from any of the widely separated seven different populations; similarly the allele frequencies in the 2 L arrangement are alike in all five widely separated populations studied. The allele frequencies in the 2 L 1 arrangement are intermediate to those observed in the 2 L 3 and the 2 L arrangements and show north-south clinal change. These associations between Est- 1 alleles and gene arrangements of the left arm of the second chromosome are due to natural selection favoring different allele frequencies in different gene arrangements, as a result of epistatic interactions between the Est- 1 locus and the loci on the gene arrangements. As expected, we observe that the proportion of heterozygotes is greater in the inversion heterokaryotypes than in the <b>homokaryotypes...</b>|$|R

Multiply mated and polyandrous females laid more eggs and produced more offspring than singly mated and monandrous females, respectively. Polyandrous females laid more eggs, had higher egg-to-adult survival rates and produced more offspring than repeatedly mated females. Fertility rates did not differ between treatments. The observed fitness patterns therefore resulted from increased oviposition through multiple mating per se, and a further increase in oviposition coupled with higher egg-to-adult offspring survival benefits to polyandry. Daily monitoring of individual females over their entire life spans showed that multiple copulations induced early oviposition, with polyandrous females ovipositing earlier than repeatedly mated females. Singly mated and polyandrous females incurred a longevity cost independent of egg production, whereas repeatedly mated females did not. This suggests that repeatedly mating with the same male may counteract a general cost of mating. Longevity, however, was not correlated with overall female fitness.

40|$|Chromosomal inversions {{are thought}} to confer a {{selective}} advantage in alternative habitats by protecting co-adapted alleles from recombination. The frequencies of two inversions (2 La and 2 Rb) of the afro-tropical malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae change gradually along geographical clines, increasing in frequency with degree of aridity. Such clines can result from gene flow and local selection acting upon alternative karyotypes along the cline, suggesting that these inversions {{may be associated with}} tolerance to xeric conditions. Since water loss represents a major challenge in xeric habitats, it can be supposed that genes inside these inversions are involved in water homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, we compared the desiccation resistance of alternative karyotypes from a colonised 2 Rb/ 2 La polymorphic population of A. gambiae from Cameroon. The strain included only the molecular form S, one of the genetic units marking incipient speciation in this taxon. Day-old mosquitoes of both sexes were assayed individually for time to death in a dry environment and the karyotype of each was determined post-mortem using molecular diagnostic assays for each inversion. In agreement with expectations based on their eco-geographical distribution, we found that 2 La <b>homokaryotypes</b> survived significantly longer (1. 3 hours) than the other karyotypes. However, there was weak support for the effect of 2 Rb on desiccation resistance. Larger mosquitoes survived longer than smaller ones. Median survival of females was greater than males, but the effect of sex on desiccation resistance was weakly supported, indicating that differential survival was correlated to differences betwee...|$|R
40|$|Chromosomal inversions disrupt {{recombination}} in heterozygotes by both reducing crossing-over within inverted {{regions and}} increasing it {{elsewhere in the}} genome. The reduction of recombination in inverted regions facilitates the maintenance of hybridizing species, as outlined by various models of chromosomal speciation. We present a comprehensive comparison {{of the effects of}} inversions on recombination rates and on nucleotide divergence. Within an inversion differentiating Drosophila pseudoobscura and Drosophila persimilis, we detected one double recombinant among 9, 739 progeny from F 1 hybrids screened, consistent with published double-crossover frequencies observed within species. Despite similar rates of exchange within and between species, we found no sequence-based evidence of ongoing gene exchange between species within this inversion, but significant exchange was inferred within species. We also observed greater differentiation at regions near inversion breakpoints between species versus within species. Moreover, we observed strong “interchromosomal effect” (higher recombination in inversion heterozygotes between species) with up to 9 -fold higher recombination rates along collinear segments of chromosome two in hybrids. Further, we observed that regions most susceptible to changes in recombination rates corresponded to regions with lower recombination rates in <b>homokaryotypes.</b> Finally, we showed that interspecies nucleotide divergence is lower in regions with greater increases in recombination rate, potentially resulting from greater interspecies exchange. Overall, we have identified several similarities and differences between inversions segregating within versus between species in their effects on recombination and divergence. We conclude that these differences are most likely due to lower frequency of heterokaryotypes and to fitness consequences from the accumulation of various incompatibilities between species. Additionally, we have identified possible effects of inversions on interspecies gene exchange that had not been considered previously...|$|R
40|$|Development {{time and}} body weight of In(2 L) t, R (a {{putative}} short inversion {{on the left}} arm of the second chromosome) and ST (standard) karyotypes of Drosophila melanogaster were measured at different temperatures. Frequency changes were followed in populations polymorphic for In(2 L) t and ST and kept under different environmental conditions. These experiments were carried out in order to explain the worldwide latitudinal clines for In(2 L) t and other inversions. To avoid interactions with the Adh and alpha-Gpdh loci, which also have latitudinal clines, all karyotypes were homozygous Adh(s) alpha-Gpdh(F). In(2 L) t <b>homokaryotypes</b> had a longer development time and a lower weight than the other karyotypes at all temperatures. R/ST heterokaryotypes had the shortest development time and ST/ST had the smallest weight decrease with increasing temperature. The differences among the In(2 L) t and ST karyotypes in development time were further analyzed in an experiment where {{the age at which}} 50 % of the larvae were able to become adults, without further food ingestion, was determined. In polymorphic populations at 20 -degrees and 25 -degrees a signficant decline of In(2 L) t frequencies was observed. At 29. 5 -degrees and 33 -degrees there was no change in In(2 L) t frequencies but a significant excess of heterokaryotypes occurred. On ethanol-supplemented food the most drastic decline in In(2 L) t frequency was observed. Populations transferred at 2 - and 3 -week intervals at 25 -degrees exhibited large differences in final In(2 L) t frequencies. The frequency changes could in part be attributed to the differences in development time and to previously observed differences in high temperature resistance. The experiments prove that the karyotypes are under selection. The results are discussed in relation to the geographic distribution of In(2 L) t...|$|R
40|$|Recombination {{occurs during}} meiosis to produce new allelic {{combinations}} in natural populations, and thus strongly affects evolutionary processes. The model system Drosophila has been crucial {{for understanding the}} mechanics underlying recombination and assessing the association between recombination rate and several evolutionary parameters. Drosophila was the first system in which genetic maps were developed using recombination frequencies between genes. Further, Drosophila {{has been used to}} determine genetic and environmental conditions that cause variation in recombination rate. Finally, Drosophila has been instrumental in elucidating associations between local recombination rate and nucleotide diversity, divergence and codon bias, as well as helping determine the causes of these associations. Here I present a fine-scale map of recombination rates across two major chromosomes in Drosophila persimilis using 181 SNP markers spanning two of five major chromosome arms. Using this map, I report significant fine-scale heterogeneity of local recombination rates. However, I also observed "recombinational neighborhoods", where adjacent intervals had similar recombination rates after excluding regions near the centromere and telomere. I further found significant positive associations of fine-scale recombination rate with repetitive element abundance and a 13 -bp sequence motif known to associate with human recombination rates. I noted strong crossover interference extending 5 - 7 Mb from the initial crossover event. Further, I observed that fine-scale recombination rates in D. persimilis are strongly correlated with those obtained from a comparable study of its sister species, D. pseudoobscura. I documented a significant relationship between recombination rates and intron nucleotide sequence diversity within species, but no relationship between recombination rate and intron divergence between species. These results are consistent with selection models (hitchhiking and background selection) rather than mutagenic recombination models for explaining the relationship of recombination with nucleotide diversity within species. Finally, I found significant correlations between recombination rate and GC content, supporting both GC-biased gene conversion (BGC) models and selection-driven codon bias models. Next, I looked at the role of chromosomal inversions in species maintenance by examining the impact of inversions distinguishing species to disrupt recombination rates within inverted regions, at inversion boundaries and throughout the remainder of the genome. By screening nearly 10, 000 offspring from females heterozygous for 3 major inversions, I observed recombination rates within an inverted region in hybrids between Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis to be ~ 10 - 4 (similar to rates of exchange for inversion heterozygotes within species). However, despite the apparent potential for exchange, I do not find empirical evidence of ongoing gene exchange within the largest of 3 major inversions in DNA sequence analyses of strains isolated from natural populations. Finally, I observe a strong 'interchromosomal effect' with up to 9 -fold higher (> 800 % different) recombination rates along collinear segments of chromosome 2 in hybrids, revealing a significantly negative association between interchromosomal effect and recombination rate in <b>homokaryotypes,</b> and I show that interspecies nucleotide divergence is lower in regions with larger changes in recombination rates in hybrids, potentially resulting from greater interspecies exchange. This last result suggests an effect of chromosomal inversions on interspecies gene exchange not considered previously. Finally, I experimentally tested for a novel male-mediated effect on female recombination rates by crossing males that differed by either induced treatment variation or standing genetic variation to genetically identical females. After assaying recombination frequency in the offspring of these genetic crosses, I fitted these data to a statistical model where I showed no effect of male temperature treatment or male genetic background on offspring recombination rate. However, I did observe a difference of recombination rates of offspring laid 5 - 8 days post-mating between males treated with Juvenile Hormone relative to control males. Environmental variation in male ability to affect recombination rate in their mates suggests the potential for sexual conflict on optimal proportion of recombinant offspring, perhaps leading to changes in population-level recombination rates with varying levels of sexual selection. Overall, my map of fine-scale recombination rates allowed me to confirm findings of broader-scale studies and identify multiple novel features that merit further investigation. Furthermore, I have identified several similarities and differences between inversions segregating within vs. between species in their effects on recombination and divergence, and I have identified possible effects of inversions on interspecies gene exchange that had not been considered previously. Finally, I have provided some evidence that males may impact female recombination rates, although future work should attempt to explore the range of male differences that impact this trait and the mechanism through which males impact the outcome of female meiosis.
