40|$|ABSTRACTThe global {{price of}} oil, {{which is both}} finite and limited in quantity, has been rising {{steadily}} because of the increasing requirements for energy in both developing and developed countries. Furthermore, regulations have been strengthened across all industries to address global warming. Many studies of hull resistance, propulsion and operation of ships have been performed {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and emissions. This study examined the design parameters of the propeller boss cap fin (PBCF) and <b>hub</b> <b>cap</b> for 6, 000 TEU container ships to improve the propulsion efficiency. The design parameters of PBCF have been selected based on the geometrical shape. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis with a propeller open water (POW) test was performed to check the validity of CFD analysis. The design of experiment (DOE) case was selected as a full factorial design, and the experiment was analyzed by POW and CFD analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine the correlation among design parameters. Four design alternatives of PBCF were selected from the DOE. The shape of a propeller <b>hub</b> <b>cap</b> was selected as a divergent shape, and the divergent angle was determined by the DOE. Four design alternatives of PBCF were attached to the divergent <b>hub</b> <b>cap,</b> and the POW was estimated by CFD. As a result, the divergent <b>hub</b> <b>cap</b> with PBCF has a negative effect on the POW, which is induced by an increase in torque coefficient. A POW test and cavitation test were performed with a divergent <b>hub</b> <b>cap</b> with PBCF to verify the CFD result. The POW test result showed that the open water efficiency was increased approximately 2 % with a divergent <b>hub</b> <b>cap</b> compared to a normal cap. The POW test result was similar to the CFD result, and the divergent <b>hub</b> <b>cap</b> with the PBCF models showed lower open water efficiency. This was attributed to an increase in the torque coefficient just like the CFD results. A cavitation test was performed using the 2 models selected. The test result showed that the hub vortex is increased downstream of the propeller...|$|R

25|$|When {{air flows}} around the wheel wells it gets {{disturbed}} by the rims of the vehicles, and forms an area of turbulence around the wheel. In order for the air to flow smoother around the wheel well smooth wheel covers are often applied. Smooth wheel covers are <b>hub</b> <b>caps</b> with no holes in them for air to pass through. This design reduces drag, however, it may cause the brakes to heat up quicker because the covers prevent airflow around the brake system. This is why this modification is more commonly seen with high efficiency vehicles, rather than sports cars or racing vehicles.|$|E

40|$|In this PhD thesis, a {{comprehensive}} aerodynamic {{characterization of the}} helicopter main rotor hub beanie is carried out. This component {{is involved in the}} reduction of the tail shake phenomenon which is a problem of great concern for the industrial manufactures, such as AgustaWestland, the helicopter company that has sponsored this research. The numerical model of three beanie geometries are created and validated against specific experimental data. Then, an extensive CFD test campaign was carried out to evaluate the aerodynamic performance of such a component at different operating conditions and in different configurations. In particular, the attention is focused on the analysis of both the beanie capabilities to downward deflect the oncoming flow, and the aerodynamic loads that act on this component. On the basis of these analyses, a series of new guidelines for the design and the certification of the beanie are gathered and submitted to AgustaWestland. Moreover, the aerodynamic optimization of a specific beanie model, the AW 101, is presented in this work. The final aim is the investigation of new <b>hub</b> <b>cap</b> geometries that manifest improved capabilities in the downward deflection of wake and low aerodynamic drag with respect to the original model. Amongst the different optimal solutions provided by the multi-objective optimization carried out using an advanced evolutionary algorithm, three new beanie geometries are selected and analysed via CFD to compare their aerodynamic performances to those of the original AW 101 <b>hub</b> <b>cap.</b> Finally, a new beanie concept-design, named HBM, is presented. The model was created in order to investigate the effects of a hollow structure on the beanie capabilities in the downward deflection of the wake. A parametric study is also carried out to highlight the effects of some specific geometrical parameters on the beanie performances. The results are encouraging, and the HBM model seems promising, though a more comprehensive numerical analysis will be required before the model can be used for real industrial purpose...|$|R
