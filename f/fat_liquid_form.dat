40|$|Milkfat {{is one of}} {{the most}} complex of all fats, {{consisting}} of numerous different triglycerides as well as complex fats, such as phospholipids and cerebrosides, and traces of mineral substances (Walstra and Jenness, 1984). It is liquid above 40 °C and usually completely solidified below - 40 °C. At intermediate temperatures, it is a mixture of crystals and oil, the oil being the continuous phase. On cooling, a <b>liquid</b> <b>fat</b> usually <b>forms</b> small crystals at first (in rapid cooling, often in α modification) of needle to platelet shape, 0. 1 - 3. 0 μm long, with a ratio length:width:thickness of 4 : 2 : 1, (Jensen, 1967). As crystals grow, similar shaped but larger crystals in aggregate which can be as much as 50 μm across, are formed. Crystallisation is initiated by the presence of suitable crystal nuclei (centres of crystallisation) in the <b>liquid</b> <b>fat</b> as a few molecules gather in molecular aggregates where the potential energy is reduced to the minimum. Lowering of temperature strongly influences the rate of nucleus formation. Homogeneous nucleation occurs when crystals nuclei are formed spontaneously from a pure melt. Usually a supercooling of 3 - 5 °C is needed to start a nucleation, and a further temperature decrease by a few degrees can caused rapid nucleation. In practice, for fat in bulk, nucleation is always heterogeneous, i. e. crystallisation always starts at the surface of extraneous particles, often called catalytic impurities (Skoda el at, 1963) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{could not}} {{reproduce}} the model described by Lieber et al for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis model in rats. In our trial the high <b>fat</b> <b>liquid</b> diet group of rats gained nearly 100  g or less weight {{compared to the}} mean weight gain stated in the original article. However, the fasting glucose level was statistically higher in this group {{as compared to the}} chow diet group. Some pathological abnormalities in the duodenum and jejunum samples were observed in the high <b>fat</b> <b>liquid</b> diet group. We do not know the exact reason for these changes. Overall, our study results arose some suspicions about the reproducibility of the model. Furthermore, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, no study using the proposed model has been published so far...|$|R
50|$|Liquid manure is manure in a <b>liquid</b> <b>form.</b> Manure {{is changed}} into a <b>liquid</b> <b>form</b> by mixing the manure with water. Generally, liquid manure {{is used as a}} {{convenient}} alternative to manure, which cannot be spread as evenly as its <b>liquid</b> <b>form.</b> Manure in both states is used as a nutrient-enriched fertilizer for plants.|$|R
40|$|The {{absorption}} of potassium chloride in <b>liquid</b> <b>form</b> has been studied, using urinary excretion as {{an index of}} absorption. The excretion of potassium chloride was observed after inducing a water diuresis and administering a single dose in <b>liquid</b> <b>form.</b> There is evidence that potassium chloride in <b>liquid</b> <b>form</b> is absorbed rapidly, probably from the stomach, and hence {{there is a good}} rationale for its use where rapid absorption is needed, as in digitalis intoxication...|$|R

30|$|Radiographs are {{the primary}} {{screening}} technique used for bone tumours and tumour-like lesions [1]. When a lesion is indeterminate or shows signs of aggressiveness, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indicated for further characterisation [1]. It can extend the diagnostic evaluation by demonstrating components such as cartilage, vascular tissue, <b>fat,</b> <b>liquid</b> and haemosiderin. Even when a specific diagnosis cannot be made, MRI can help by narrowing the differential diagnosis. These are the reasons why MRI has changed from a single study-based diagnosis (solely based on radiographs) to a multimodal imaging approach (which now includes MRI).|$|R
