Once fully absorbed, while wearing protective gloves, the material may be scooped <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> bag, sealed and disposed. The spill area may be scrubbed with a stiff brush and warm, soapy water. The soapy water is not recommended to be drained in a storm drain.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Dictaphone {{replaced}} wax cylinders {{with their}} Dictabelt technology, which cut a mechanical groove <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> belt instead of into a wax cylinder. This was later replaced by magnetic tape recording. However, cylinders for older style dictating machines {{continued to be}} available for some years, {{and it was not}} unusual to encounter cylinder dictating machines into the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|The SG 550 has a side-folding {{skeletonized}} buttstock (folds to {{the right}} side of the receiver) and a lightweight aluminium bipod that folds into grooves in the lower handguard. The hinged stock is firmly locked in the folded position by a socket in the butt which clips <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> stud on the handguard; a firm pull will release the stock which is then swung into the closed position and locked by a button catch. A collapsible side-folding stock is also available. The stock, pistol grip, and handguards are made of a high-strength polymer, and are produced in either green or black colour options. The steel receiver housing and several other components are manufactured using stamping and welding; external steel surfaces are finished with a ceramic-reinforced enamel coat known as Ilaflon. The gas system's components are made of stainless steel. The barrel, bolt, bolt carrier, and firing pin are all made with steel that has been gas nitrided, hardened and tempered. The bolt and carrier, along with most other components internal to the receiver undergo a phosphating process.|$|E

2500|$|Yawgoog Segments {{are unique}} awards to the camp, {{and have been}} fairly popular for years. Segments are small, curved patches which go around the {{circular}} Yawgoog patch. Some choose to sew the segments and central patch directly on their uniform shirt, while others sew them to a circular piece of material such as felt or leather, or insert them <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> holder which can be worn from a pocket button. A felt circle found at the trading post can hold up to four rows of segments. The original ten segments started in 1951 were strips of cloth. The original cloth segments included the three CYs, the 1 through Veteran years, the Knights of Yawgoog and the now defunct Wincheck braves. Since segments have been added for Camp (TP,MB,SB), additional camping years (V-6 through V-9), Shooting sports (Yeoman, Riffle and Trap), Challenge/rows courses (AI,AC,AII,AIII and formerly CV), Aquatics (Mile swimming, kayaking, canoeing, sailing), Various camp areas (Campcraft, HCAS, YHC, Barn), Hiking (Hiker of Yawgoog, GPS), Resident state, troop award (Troop of the week), Leadership (SPL, SM, ASM, CIT, Staff), [...] and jubilee years (25, 50, 75 and 100).As {{a member of the}} CIT Corps, a Scout may earn the Top Basic award, for those who have excelled as a leader during their Basic week of Counselor Training. This award is determined by a vote among the Basic week Scouts. Members of the CIT Corps are also graded after their field weeks. The CIT with the top performance during his basic and field weeks for the entire summer is given the Frederick W. Marvel award. The award includes a certificate, and a gold medal suspended from a red, white, and blue ribbon.|$|E
60|$|But, {{first of}} all, do you clearly {{understand}} what a chrysalis is driving at? It means more than it seems; the change that goes on within that impassive case {{is a great deal}} more profound than most people imagine. When the caterpillar is just ready to turn into a butterfly it lies by for a while, full of internal commotion, and feels all its organs slowly melting one by one into a sort of indistinguishable protoplasmic pulp; chaos precedes the definite re-establishment of a fresh form of order. Limbs and parts and nervous system all disappear for a time, and then gradually grow up again in new and altered types. The caterpillar, if it philosophised on its own state at all (which seems to be very little the habit of well-conducted caterpillars, as of well-conducted young ladies), might easily be excused for forming just at first the melancholy impression that a general dissolution was coming over it piecemeal. It must begin by feeling legs and eyes and nervous centres melt away by degrees into a common indistinguishable organic pulp, out of which the new organs only slowly form themselves in obedience to the law of some internal impulse. But when the process is all over, and--hi, presto!--the butterfly emerges at last from the chrysalis condition, what does it find but that instead of having lost everything it has new and stronger legs in place of the old and feeble ones; it has nerves and brain more developed than before; it has wings for flight instead of mere creeping little feet to crawl with? What seemed like chaos was really nothing more than the necessary kneading up of all component parts <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> condition which precedes every fresh departure in evolution. The old must fade before the new can replace it.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{invention}} of the audion tube in 1906, electric microphones gradually replaced the purely acoustical recording methods of earlier dictaphones by the late 1930s. In 1945, the SoundScriber and Gray Audograph, which cut grooves <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> disc, was introduced, and two years later Dictaphone replaced wax cylinders with their Dictabelt technology, which cut a mechanical groove <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>plastic</b> belt instead of into a wax cylinder. This was later replaced by magnetic tape recording. While reel-to-reel tape was used for dictation, the inconvenience of threading tape spools led to development of more convenient formats, notably the Compact Cassette, Mini-Cassette, and Microcassette.|$|E
