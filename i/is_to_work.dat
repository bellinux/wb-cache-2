25|$|Unlike a chattel slave, a wage laborer can (barring {{unemployment}} {{or lack of}} job offers) {{choose between}} employers, but they usually constitute a minority of owners in the population for which the wage laborer must work, while attempts to implement workers' control on employers' businesses may be considered an act of theft or insubordination, and thus be met with violence, imprisonment or other legal and social measures. The wage laborer's starkest choice <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for an employer or face poverty or starvation. If a chattel slave refuses to work, a number of punishments are also available; from beatings to food deprivation – although economically rational slave owners practiced positive reinforcement to achieve best results and before losing their investment by killing an expensive slave.|$|E
