40|$|Building on {{critical}} {{perspectives on the}} state and the informal economy, this article provides an analysis of the "state of the state" on the eastern Mindanao mineral frontier. In the first instance, the author explains that the massive expansion of informal small-scale gold mining, instead of undermining state rule, has given rise to <b>joint</b> <b>institutions</b> of extraction that promote the interests of local politicians and informal miners, amongst others. Relying on the coercive and legitimizing strengths of local state institutions, local politicians have created an environment conducive to the persistence and arguably the further expansion of small-scale gold mining. In the process, they not only beef up their personal authority and the state's fiscal revenues, but also contribute to the consolidation of state rule on the upland frontier. Transcending the local level, this parallel process of small-scale mining expansion and state consolidation, the author argues, can be understood {{as the result of a}} long-standing tradition of decentralized state building through local strongmen-politicians. Finally, attention is drawn to the expansion of large-scale mining and how it is highly likely to upset the sociopolitical stability built around joint extraction regimes in the informal small-scale mining economy...|$|E

Innovation system is the network and interplay of academic and production institutions in which production, distribution and use of new knowledge and technology take place.

T-H is formed by these three institutional spheres which are increasingly working together, with a spiral pattern of linkages. Each institutional sphere can not completely instead of others although wish to substitute them, and the best way is complementary each other. In the overlap areas of the triple-helix model, there are enough spaces for the complementation. The overlap area implies that it has the possibility of collaboration with it. The question is how to set up some <b>joint</b> <b>institutions,</b> which we can call them “interface organizations” to organize and coordinate the activities and interactions between these institutions.

In this paper, we explore the extent to which EU has sought to promote regional integration beyond its borders. More specifically, we analyze what exactly the EU seeks to export and how it has used its external relations and foreign policy to foster the cooperation between regions (inter-regionalism), on the one hand, and regional cooperation among third countries, on the other. We proceed in three steps. The first part of the paper outlines the mechanisms and instruments through which the EU diffuses the idea of regional integration to other regions and fosters regional integration among third countries. In the second part, we take stock of the EU’s attempts to export regional integration focusing on the mechanisms it has drawn upon. We conclude with some considerations to what extent the promotion of regional integration constitutes a genuine EU agenda for global governance. identity; ideas; integration theory; closer cooperation; governance; Europeanization; Europeanization...|$|E

40|$|At present, {{the opening}} of joint {{educational}} institutions {{is one of the}} leading educational trends. It allows states to improve the quality of national human resources and the national education system. Thus, it is particularly important for transition economies in the context of an innovative model of development. Russia and China turned to this practice in 2010 after the launch of the SCO University, established by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Today joint educational institutions function not only multilaterally but also bilaterally. This article examines the Shenzhen MSU-BIT University, a joint Russian-Chinese university, as a tool to promote the national interests of the two countries. The author presents the basic history of Russian-Chinese cooperation in education in the second half of the 20 th century. She argues that the Cultural Revolution and period the subsequent of difficult relations between the two countries had a negative impact on educational ties. Russia lost 17 years in China’s educational market, which was filled by other countries, primarily the United States. At the beginning of the 20 th century, Russian-Chinese humanitarian cooperation was positive. The author relates the increase in the volume of Russian-Chinese educational exchange to the success of several events, including the large-scale projects of the Year of Russia in China and the Year of China in Russia, the Year of Chinese Language in Russia and Russian Language in China, {{the opening of}} the Russian Cultural Centre and the Chinese Cultural Centre, Russian centres and cabinets of the “Russian World” in China, and Confucius Institutes and classes in Russia. After analyzing the current situation, the author describes the new forms of cooperation, which include the opening of <b>joint</b> <b>institutions.</b> She assesses the interests and prospects of Russian and Chinese participation in the creation of the Shenzhen MSU-BIT University through the prism of national interests. Her methodology is based on the principles of integrated research and relies on sources, using problem-chronological and comparative methods, content analysis and event analysis. The author also refers to similar projects between China and the United States, Australia and several European countries. She stresses that <b>joint</b> <b>institutions</b> contribute to the competitiveness of educational services of the participating countries, and also serve as an effective tool for promoting national culture, language, values and lifestyles. The author demonstrates the advantages of this form of cooperation for Russia and China as a new mechanism of collective cooperation. The author concludes that Russia is interested in establishing joint educational institutions with China primarily as an instrument of soft power that can increase the competitiveness of Russian education, not only in China but throughout Asia, and can promote the Russian language. For China, it is important to get access to Russian intellectual resources for its further socioeconomic development. She ends with a proposal for the creation of a Russian-Chinese university that could contribute to the successful implementation of this project...|$|E
40|$|Initial {{political}} steps towards {{unification of}} European nations on level terms, i. e. on non-hegemony terms, were made within {{the period between}} the two World Wars. These endeavours culminated with The Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which was signed on 18 April 1951 in Paris by France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxemburg. The Treaty of Rome, establishing the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), signed in Rome on 25 March 1957 broadened the economic integrations, and finally the Maastricht Treaty signed on December 1992 envisaged the establishment of economical and monetary union.

As far as the political integration of Europe is concerned, divergent directions occurred after the World War II: the first, streaming towards the establishment of the union of European nations, while the second was reflected in founding of Atlantic, namely Euro-Atlantic organizations. Furthermore, there has been a constant struggle ever since between those advocating a tighter federation and those wishing a looser union of European states. Political integration is followed by attempts to create a fundamentally joint European identity based on mutual cultural heritage. Economic, educational, and political integrations within the framework of European Union are an expression of pan-national aspirations, which could – if successful – result in establishment of a single European nation, founded on the civil-territorial principle...|$|E

The {{aim is to}} {{identify}} differences and similarities between the river basins in the two regions {{in order to increase}} our knowledge and understanding of the issue of shared rivers. Relevant data were mainly collected and methods applied include document and literature review, text analysis, interviews with key professional persons during several study visits to the regions. Both the physical geography and the sectoral water uses of the rivers were presented and analyzed. Climatic similarities stand out when comparing the basins, as they are characterized by unevenly distributed rainfall patterns with great seasonal and annual variations, and the regions are water scarce. In both regions, the population is increasing, while the available water resource is decreasing. In all of the four basins, the regions are facing inevitable crisis of water scarcity. The river basins differ however primarily in terms of physical development of rivers’ water resources. The rivers in SADC have been developed for varieties of uses while the rivers in HoA are under-developed and under-utilized. The SADC rivers have established <b>joint</b> <b>institutions</b> for cross-border river cooperation while the HoA rivers have never had any type of river cooperation. Since the rivers have almost similar climatic and physical conditions, the legitimate research question in the future could be: what caused the differences in resource development and cooperation?

The process of Western Balkans European integration represents one of the clear manifestations of a real regional integration experiences with its growing international influence. The European Union is seeking to repeat the success of its eastern enlargement in the Western Balkans. The Western Balkans represent a complex and diverse reality in Europe, an integral part of Europe, as well as all the countries that make up the Balkans are European countries. So the raised question is related to standardization of all European countries in political and economic organization, a strategic goal that has been clearly defined since {{the first day of the}} founding of the European Communities. Between arguments and counterarguments, Western Balkans countries are turning to the European Union to speed up their economic reconstruction, reconstruction of political road map, improve their mutual relations (long scarred by ethnic and religious wars) and consolidate their democratic institutions and their proper functionality. The main goal of this paper is to explore the achievements, ongoing actions and specifics within the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, applied model of applicability, skepticism for further Enlargement and consequences of long term existence of the enlargement. Additionally, it has been stated the essence of Negotiation process for obtaining Financial support by Institutions and project launched by the Union. The process of Support to the Economic stabilisation and Reforms in the Region are more than important subject, based on real applications provided by the Western Balkans candidate states. On a parallel way, in the article is elaborated the subject of free movement of people, as well as visa facilitation, Finally, the process of Western Balkans integration and supporting process is facing the new challenge with the ongoing and completely unpredictable Refugee crises.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{economic}} reform and trade liberalization in Latin America and the Caribbean, under way {{since the end of}} the 1980 s, has brought about an increasing integration of the countries in the region into the world economy, both in terms of commercial and investment flows. At the same time, Latin American countries have been pursuing the process of deepening economic integration at the subregional level, negotiating trade liberalization at the regional and hemispheric level, as well as engaging in multilateral trade negotiations. Latin American countries are also negotiating cooperation and free trade agreements with other countries and regions of the world, both developing and industrial ones. These developments, as well the emergence of new powerful players on the international arena, such as China and India, represent opportunities but also enormous challenges for Latin America. In facing these challenges, the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean are open to ideas, experiences and good practices that may contribute to their successful integration into an increasingly open and competitive international economy. In this regard, the rich European experience in the process of regional integration over the last decades that has brought about not only mutual trade liberalization, but also the establishment of <b>joint</b> <b>institutions,</b> a common currency as well as political cooperation and a strong component of solidarity among member countries could be of benefit for the region.
