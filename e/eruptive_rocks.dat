The intrusions are thought to be subvolcanic bodies associated with a volcanic front that was active in the Miocene, during early stages of subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate.

40|$|The {{chemical}} analysis by EMP/EDS of 140 samples in cores from six Red Sea troughs and basins {{has led to}} the discovery in the Nereus Deep of high vanadium concentrations (up to 1. 3 % V 2 O 3) in several bulk samples, and to the isolation of a major magnetite phase. This vanado-magnetite, remarkable for its high content of vanadium (mean = 1. 45 % V 2 O 3) and its lack of titanium is frequently zoned, the V-content decreasing toward the outer zones. Oxides with up to 42 % V 2 O 3, have also been found. Since the origin of the magnetite is clearly authigenic, its high vanadium and low titanium concentrations are traced back to the differential hydrothermal leaching of Fe-Ti-oxides which occur profusely in basic <b>eruptive</b> <b>rock</b> clasts, actually present in some of the overlying seams. -AuthorsSCOPUS: NotDefined. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|The rate of {{ascent of}} the thermal {{perturbation}} of <b>eruptive</b> <b>rock</b> {{types in the}} Kenya Dome region can be calculated for depths of origin ranging from greater than 170 km to the lower crust (25 - 30 km) as combined with dated occurrences. An equation is derived and solved iteratively for ascent velocity at 10 km depth intervals from 150 - 30 km, assuming a thermal diffusivity of 1 sq mm/sec. For radii of 50 and 100 km and constant gradient increases within the range 55 - 60 C/km over the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) ascent depth range, the calculated rate of upwelling corresponds well {{with the results of}} a simple thermal model of lithospheric thinning. A 1 C/km change in gradient results approximately in a 0. 55 Myr change in ascent time from 150 to 30 km, due to the increasing differential between the geotherm and the solidus with decreasing depths and the increasing rate of heat loss to the surface. It is suggested by the temporal-spatial-compositional relations of eruptives in the Kenya Dome region that there is a shallowing of magma source regions with time, implying encroachment of a thermal anomaly...|$|R

2500|$|As {{the last}} of the Kula Plate decayed and the Farallon Plate {{advanced}} back into this area from the south, it once again started to subduct under the continental margin of Western Canada 37million years ago, supporting a chain of volcanoes called the Cascade Volcanic Arc. At least four volcanic formations along the British Columbia Coast are associated with Cascadia subduction zone volcanism. The oldest is the eroded 18-million-year-old Pemberton Volcanic Belt which extends west-northwest from south-central British Columbia to the Queen Charlotte Islands in the northeast where it lies [...] west of mainland British Columbia. In the south it is defined by a group of epizonal intrusions and a few erosional remnants of <b>eruptive</b> <b>rock.</b> Farther north in the large Ha-Iltzuk and Waddington icefields, it includes two large dissected calderas called Silverthrone Caldera and Franklin Glacier Volcano while the Queen Charlotte Islands to the northeast contain a volcanic formation ranging in age from Miocene to Pliocene called the Masset Formation. Although widely separated from each other, all Pemberton Belt rocks are of similar age and have similar magma compositions. Therefore, these magmatic rocks are believed to be products of arc volcanism related to subduction of the Farallon Plate. By late Pliocene time the Farallon Plate had been greatly reduced in size and its northern portion ultimately broke off between five and seven million years ago to form a new plate boundary called the Nootka Fault. This rupture created the two small Juan de Fuca and Explorer plates that lie off the west coast of Vancouver Island.|$|R

Here, we provide a context for the book, placing individual chapters within the milieu of previous work, including some magnetic techniques that were not used in the particular studies described herein. Thermo-remanent magnetization is a powerful tool to understand processes related to heating and cooling of rocks, including estimating the temperature of emplacement of pyroclastic deposits, which may allow us to better understand the rates of cooling during eruption and transport. Aniso-tropy of magnetic susceptibility and anisotropy of remanence are used primarily to investigate rock fabrics, and allow the interpretation of flow dynamics in dykes, lava flows and pyroclastic deposits, as well as the location of the <b>eruptive</b> vents. <b>Rock</b> magnetic characteristics can help in the corre-lation of volcanic deposits but also providemeans to date volcanic deposits and to better understand the processes of cooling of the deposits, as the magnetic minerals can change with temperature. In addition, volcanic rocksmay be key recorders of past magnetic fields, allowing a better understand-ing of changes in field intensity and, perhaps, providing clues of how the magnetic field is formed.

40|$|The Villa Senni Eruption Unit (VSEU) {{belongs to}} the Tuscolano-Artemisio phase of {{volcanic}} activity in the Alban Hills Volcanic District, the closest to Rome of the recent or active volcanoes of central Italy. The most important products of this eruption are represented by pyroclastic flow deposits, named lower and upper flow unit (LFU and UFU, respectively). Three main rock types form VSEU as follows: (1) juvenile K-foiditic scoria clasts of the LFU; (2) juvenile phonotephritic scoria clasts of the UFU; and (3) holocrystalline phonotephritic Lithic inclusions (Italites) in the UFU. On {{the basis of the}} chemistry, mineralogy and petrography of the three studied rock types their phase relations have been discussed. Other petrologic constraints from laboratory melting experiments are presented and used to investigate the role of volatiles on the evolution of the magma chamber system. Some broad implications on withdrawal pattern are also presented. It has been verified the LFU rock type can be obtained from a parental melt of UFU composition by a CO 2 -controlled crystal-liquid fractionation of a solid assemblage close in composition to that of Italites. Because it can be proved that the storage of magma occurred at shallow depth within the Mesozoic carbonate country rocks, it is proposed that CO 2 diffusion, originating from thermal decomposition of wall-rock carbonates, controlled the evolution trend of the melt at the periphery of the magma chamber, whereas the inner part of the magma body retained the volatile component (essentially H 2 O) of the original melt. The corresponding eruption model is therefore comprehensive of an early <b>eruptive</b> phase (LFU <b>rock</b> type) involving the more differentiated central magma bulb, whereas the late <b>eruptive</b> phase (UFU <b>rock</b> type) tapped the more mafic peripheral magma.
