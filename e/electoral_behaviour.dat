With ample of data, it is evidently shown that ethnicity determines {{the choice of}} votes and voter‘s decisions in electioneering in Nigeria.

Theoretical definitions of the communal politics’ knowledge are needed for their empirical analysis. Theoretical part of the present issue contents definitions of key words. Key words are connected with the communal politics’ area. Specifically, we need to define politics. It is also necessary to specify politics’ role in the contemporary society. This issue focusses on the communal politics. It also specifies the basic aim of the communal politics and it also defines communal politics’ objectives and specifications. At last, there is also described the participation of individuals on communal politics’ formation and development. Generally, the citizens are considered to be actors of the communal politics. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on the conditions of the individuals’ participation on electoral process. Communal politics’ empirical exploration is characterised by the conditionality of the individuals’ participation on electoral process in their residence. In this context, it is important to deal with the impact of individual aspects on the voter decisions of individuals. In the society, there are various groups of people. Young people are one of the significant sociable groups. They gradually incorporate into decision processes. Decision processes affect young people’s existence of daily life. Their decisions are determined by the exposure of general factors of the socialization. Therefore, it is important to explore determinants of the young people’s participation on communal politics.

5000|$|In this book, {{the author}} {{analyses}} {{the influence of}} geographical and social determinants (structure of ownership, relation to authority, the influence of traditional structures) on the vote of the inhabitants of fifteen departments in western France. He thus compares different territorial units by postulating {{that there is a}} correlation between the social structures that are anchored in the local geography and the behaviour of the voters. Under this approach, and based on an old French saying that [...] "the limestone gave the teacher and granite the priest", Siegfried then establishes a direct relationship between the geography of the Vendée and the vote of the people. In the geological division of the territory (in the north of the department, the granite bocage, to the south the calcareous plain), it is possible to superimpose according to him a division of the <b>electoral</b> <b>behaviours.</b> The very nature of the granitic soil favours the dispersal of the habitation, the rurality, the large landed property and Catholicism. All these factors, arising indirectly from the nature of the soil, may contribute to explaining the right-wing vote in northern Vendée at the time. On the contrary, the limestone soil favours a more restricted habitat, urbanity, small property and petite bourgeoisie. The role of the Church is less central in these areas. So the data may explain that the south of the Vendée department voted then (during {{the first years of the}} Third Republic) to the political left, that is to say in contrast to the north of the department. This work also explains the partition of the Vendée between the Republican south and the monarchist north during the French Revolution.|$|R
40|$|The Belgian consociational {{model as}} it was instituted in the early 20 th century was built along the denominational cleavage. It opposed three pillars: a catholic one, a socialist one and a (smaller) liberal one. The first was {{defending}} the right for catholic organizations to be active in welfare sectors like education and health, and promoted the respect of catholic values in state action. The two others were promoting a strong separation between {{the church and the}} state. The religious difference was not only in the political goals of each pillar but also in the background and attitudes of their members. Catholics were hardly present in either the socialist and liberal organizations. Non-catholics were very rare within catholic organizations. Voting behaviours also confirmed the religious base of Belgian politics and society. From the 1960 s onwards, the picture changed a lot. The ongoing process of secularization has reduced the religious division among citizens and has affected pillar organizations from parties to trade unions. Yet, not very much has been said on the consequences of this evolution. Most of the time, scholars hypothesised a “secularisation of the minds”, while noting that pillar organisations remained very strong, although declaring themselves open to every citizen. But in practice, few empirical studies demonstrate whether or not the religious division is in practice no longer decisive in shaping the belongings and attitudes of Belgian citizens. In this paper we aim at studying more precisely the salience of the religious cleavage in nowadays Belgium in two directions. First, <b>electoral</b> <b>behaviours</b> will be studied to determine whether religion remains a decisive variable (with a new perspective of voting behaviours of muslims). Second, party membership will be analysed in order to verify whether contemporary Belgian parties remain or not religious-based parties. This empirical evidence will help in determining whether Belgium faces a “believing without belonging” or a “belonging without believing” phenomena. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R

Several modes of <b>electoral</b> <b>behaviour</b> are tested; in particular, the continuous political activism of Cornwall’s farmers stands out. Despite remnants of the unreformed electoral system lingering into the mid-Victorian era, Cornwall developed a powerful Liberal tradition, built upon distinctive patterns of non-conformity; the Conservatives, split by dissension, saw their pre-reform ascendancy disappear." ...|$|E

50|$|James M. Buchanan criticized Keynesian {{economics}} on {{the grounds}} that governments would in practice be unlikely to implement theoretically optimal policies. The implicit assumption underlying the Keynesian fiscal revolution, according to Buchanan, was that economic policy would be made by wise men, acting without regard to political pressures or opportunities, and guided by disinterested economic technocrats. He argued that this was an unrealistic assumption about political, bureaucratic and <b>electoral</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Buchanan blamed Keynesian economics for what he considered a decline in Americas fiscal discipline. Buchanan argued that deficit spending would evolve into a permanent disconnect between spending and revenue, precisely because it brings short-term gains, so, ending up institutionalizing irresponsibility in the federal government, the largest and most central institution in our society.Martin Feldstein argues that the legacy of Keynesian economics-the misdiagnosis of unemployment, the fear of saving, and the unjustified government intervention-affected the fundamental ideas of policy makers.Milton Friedman thought that Keyness political bequest was harmful for two reasons. First, he thought whatever the economic analysis, benevolent dictatorship is likely sooner or later to lead to a totalitarian society. Second, he thought Keyness economic theories appealed to a group far broader than economists primarily because of their link to his political approach.Alex Tabarrok argues that Keynesian politics-as distinct from Keynesian policies-has failed pretty much whenever its been tried, at least in liberal democracies.|$|E
