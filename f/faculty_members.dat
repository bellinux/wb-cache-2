40|$|Attaining tenure {{is a goal}} {{of every}} <b>faculty</b> <b>member.</b> Indeed, at the {{beginning}} of every <b>faculty</b> <b>member’s</b> career, there is concern regarding the process of earning tenure. Many factors enter into the tenure decision, but most universities place weight on three primary factors: teaching effectiveness, research activity, and demonstration of service to the university and beyond. The relative importance of these three factors varies, but most universities expect “satisfactory” performance in all three areas. One of the historical reasons for faculty tenure is to protect academic freedom. Once tenure was attained, a <b>faculty</b> <b>member’s</b> academic freedom was considered safe. Recent developments in academia, however, are challenging the safety of both tenure and academic freedom. Some universities have implemented a post-tenure review process that subjects a <b>faculty</b> <b>member</b> to continuing, periodic review. Some argue that this process impedes a <b>faculty</b> <b>member’s</b> academic freedom. Since the university is considered “locked” into an agreement to retain a tenured <b>faculty</b> <b>member,</b> the <b>faculty</b> <b>member</b> has been under little obligation for further development, except for a self-imposed or professional obligation. The rationale behind post-tenure review is to demand a continuing responsibility of a <b>faculty</b> <b>member</b> to participate in faculty growth. The paper will gather and analyze accounting faculty perceptions regarding post-tenure...|$|R

40|$|This report, {{based on}} a series of {{interviews}} and document analyses, presents a case study of one new college <b>faculty</b> <b>member</b> showing the relationships between a department chair, program head, and the new <b>faculty</b> <b>member</b> concerning research expectations and development. The report argues that to be successful in the contemporary research university, a new <b>faculty</b> <b>member</b> must be equipped and able to assume directed lines of inquiry. It maintains that, considering issues of tenure, promotion, and career satisfaction, this research agenda is heightened in importance and becomes an issue for the employing department as well as the <b>faculty</b> <b>member.</b> Analysis suggests that the department chair can aid a new <b>faculty</b> <b>member</b> in establishing a research agenda by providing mentoring opportunities, allowing for open communication, providing peer support, and allowing for concentration on content knowledge.
