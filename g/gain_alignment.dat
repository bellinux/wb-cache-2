40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{dynamics}} of management and control in collaborations with suppliers of critical technology. Design/methodology/approach – Three collaborative product development projects at a system integrator in the Telecom industry were studied. The data was collected through 22 semi-structured interviews and a workshop at the studied company and its suppliers. Findings – The paper shows that in situations of high dependence on suppliers of critical technologies, control may be pursued by complementing black box development with appropriate checks and balances in the collaboration, i. e. by using combinations of control mechanisms, disconnected development and joint problem solving, contracts and trust, and alignment efforts on project and strategic levels. Further, the paper demonstrates that this involves several trade-offs related to the advantages of increased monitoring and disadvantages of decreased levels of freedom for the supplier and consequently decreased prerequisites for supplier creativity. Research limitations/implications – The qualitative approach of the research limits generalizability. Our study is limited to three projects at one firm. Practical implications – Technological roadmaps can be used as an important tool to facilitate alignment with suppliers of critical technologies. Limited influence on project level can be supported by influencing the supplier on a strategic level. By collaborating on a strategic level, firms can <b>gain</b> <b>alignment</b> for future projects and diminish the need for direct project control within the projects. Long-term collaborations facilitate control in projects with powerful suppliers of critical technologies. Originality/value – While many studies suggest simplified responses to complex situations of supplier involvement in product development, this study provides insight into the complex responses to control suppliers of critical technologies...|$|E

These have been efficiently designed to allow a wide field of view and to provide adequate support to the crystals to permit use of the TMI as a vehicle-mounted, field-deployable system. Each PMT has a locally mounted high-voltage supply that is remotely controlled. Each detector is connected to a dedicated FPGA which performs automated <b>gain</b> <b>alignment</b> and energy calibration, event timing and diagnostic health checking.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} the novel concept of proactive resource allocation {{through which the}} predictability of user behavior is exploited to balance the wireless traffic over time, and hence, significantly reduce the bandwidth required to achieve a given blocking/outage probability. We start with a simple model in which the smart wireless devices are assumed to predict the arrival of new requests and submit them to the network T time slots in advance. Using tools from large deviation theory, we quantify the resulting prediction diversity gain to establish that the decay rate of the outage event probabilities increases with the prediction duration T. This model is then generalized to incorporate {{the effect of the}} randomness in the prediction look-ahead time T. Remarkably, we also show that, in the cognitive networking scenario, the appropriate use of proactive resource allocation by the primary users improves the diversity gain of the secondary network at no cost in the primary network diversity. We also shed lights on multicasting with predictable demands and show that the proactive multicast networks can achieve a significantly higher diversity gain that scales super-linearly with T. Finally, we conclude by a discussion of the new research questions posed under the umbrella of the proposed proactive (non-causal) wireless networking framework.

40|$|Abstract Background Sequence {{alignment}} is {{a common}} tool in bioinformatics and comparative genomics. It is generally assumed that multiple sequence alignment yields better results than pair wise sequence alignment, but this assumption has rarely been tested, and never with the control provided by simulation analysis. This study used sequence simulation to examine the gain in accuracy of adding a third sequence to a pair wise alignment, particularly concentrating on how the phylogenetic position of the additional sequence relative to the first pair changes {{the accuracy of the}} initial pair's alignment as well as their estimated evolutionary distance. Results The maximal <b>gain</b> in <b>alignment</b> accuracy was found not when the third sequence is directly intermediate between the initial two sequences, but rather when it perfectly subdivides the branch leading from the root of the tree to one of the original sequences (making it half as close to one sequence as the other). Evolutionary distance estimation in the multiple alignment framework, however, is largely unrelated to alignment accuracy and rather is dependent on the position of the third sequence; the closer the branch leading to the third sequence is to the root of the tree, the larger the estimated distance between the first two sequences. Conclusion The bias in distance estimation appears to be {{a direct result of the}} standard greedy progressive algorithm used by many multiple alignment methods. These results have implications for choosing new taxa and genomes to sequence when resources are limited. </p...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: Multiple {{sequence}} alignment is {{a fundamental}} task in bioinformatics. Current tools typically form an initial alignment by merging subalignments, and then polish this alignment by repeated splitting and merging of subalignments to obtain an improved final alignment. In general this form-and-polish strategy consists of several stages, and a profusion of methods have been tried at every stage. We carefully investigate: (1) how to utilize a new algorithm for aligning alignments that optimally solves the common subproblem of merging subalignments, and (2) {{what is the best}} choice of method for each stage to obtain the highest quality alignment. Results: We study six stages in the form-and-polish strategy for multiple alignment: parameter choice, distance estimation, mergetree construction, sequence-pair weighting, alignment merging, and polishing. For each stage, we consider novel approaches as well as standard ones. Interestingly, the greatest <b>gains</b> in <b>alignment</b> quality come from (i) estimating distances by a new approach using normalized alignment costs, and (ii) polishing by a new approach using 3 -cuts. Experiments with a parameter-value oracle suggest large gains in quality may be possible through an input-dependent choice of alignment parameters, and we present a promising approach for building such an oracle. Combining the best approaches to each stage yields a new tool we call Opal that on benchmark alignments matches the quality of the top tools, without employing alignment consistency or hydrophobic gap penalties.

40|$|Image {{registration}} {{is a powerful}} tool in medical image analysis and facilitates the clinical routine in several aspects. It became an indispensable device for many medical applications including image-guided therapy systems. The basic goal of image {{registration is}} to spatially align two images that show a similar region of interest. More speci�cally, a displacement �eld respectively a transformation is estimated, that relates {{the positions of the}} pixels or feature points in one image to the corresponding positions in the other one. The so <b>gained</b> <b>alignment</b> of the images assists the doctor in comparing and diagnosing them. There exist di�erent kinds of image registration methods, those which are capable to estimate a rigid transformation or more generally an a�ne transformation between the images and those which are able to capture a more complex motion by estimating a non-rigid transformation. There are many well established non-rigid registration methods, but those which are able to preserve discontinuities in the displacement �eld are rather rare. These discontinuities appear in particular at organ boundaries during the breathing induced organ motion. In this thesis, we make use of the idea to combine motion segmentation with registration to tackle the problem of preserving the discontinuities in the resulting displacement �eld. We introduce a binary function to represent the motion segmentation and the proposed discontinuity preserving non-rigid registration method is then formulated in a variational framework. Thus, an energy functional is de�ned and its minimisation with respect to the displacement �eld and the motion segmentation will lead to the desired result. In theory, one can prove that for the motion segmentation a global minimiser of the energy functional can be found, if the displacement �eld is given. The overall minimisation problem, however, is non-convex and a suitable optimisation strategy has to be considered. Furthermore, depending on whether we use the pure L 1 -norm or an approximation of it in the formulation of the energy functional, we use di�erent numerical methods to solve the minimisation problem. More speci�cally, when using an approximation of the L 1 -norm, the minimisation of the energy functional with respect to the displacement �eld is performed through Brox et al. 's �xed point iteration scheme, and the minimisation with respect to the motion segmentation with the dual algorithm of Chambolle. On the other hand, when we make use of the pure L 1 -norm in the energy functional, the primal-dual algorithm of Chambolle and Pock is used for both, the minimisation with respect to the displacement �eld and the motion segmentation. This approach is clearly faster compared to the one using the approximation of the L 1 -norm and also theoretically more appealing. Finally, to support the registration method during the minimisation process, we incorporate additionally in a later approach the information of certain landmark positions into the formulation of the energy functional, that makes use of the pure L 1 -norm. Similarly as before, the primal-dual algorithm of Chambolle and Pock is then used for both, the minimisation with respect to the displacement �eld and the motion segmentation. All the proposed non-rigid discontinuity preserving registration methods delivered promising results for experiments with synthetic images and real MR images of breathing induced liver motion. ...|$|R
