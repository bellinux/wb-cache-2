500|$|In December 1962, the Beatles {{concluded}} {{their fifth}} and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, {{they had agreed}} that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, {{in an effort to}} maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, [...] "Look, {{if you really want to}} get in these bigger places, you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ..." [...] Lennon said: [...] "We used to dress how we liked, on and off stage. He'd tell us that jeans were not particularly smart and could we possibly manage to wear proper trousers, but he didn't want us suddenly looking square. He'd let us have our own sense of individuality." ...|$|E
500|$|Another spoof was of {{a musical}} {{detailing}} the life of Bessie Bunter, entitled Bessie! The musical starts as an Andrew Lloyd Webber parody with the setting of a girl's private school but they've [...] included {{issues such as the}} Spanish Civil War and the McCarthy era. On being asked about Bessie's fatness, the producer (Sir Dave) replies [...] "it is a sort of mental fatness". The lead actress, Carla, belts out in rehearsals one of the songs, [...] "One Day", despite insisting she has [...] "pneumonia". She says to prepare for the role she starts with the bra and then everything falls into place. Later, Bessie! is rewritten completely and the previous cast are sacked: it is, after all, a musical about [...] "a big fat girl". Meanwhile, Carla is crying and being comforted by her colleagues, but further upset by Sir Dave telling her to [...] "get the **** out of here will you Carla, we don't really want snot all over the plush love" [...] In this rewritten part of Bessie, she is played by Victoria Wood who sings an impossibly glamorous and upbeat number. However, she complains at the end that [...] "you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> this floor".|$|E
500|$|Music critics met {{the record}} with mixed reviews. German radio station [...] praised the [...] "harmonious and compatible" [...] way Inna's songs fit {{together}} on the record. They also commended the [...] "incredibly danceable and upbeat disco sound" [...] and found that she remained true to her style. Especial praise was reserved for [...] "Endless", as the station found the song distinguished itself from the other material on I Am the Club Rocker. However, Kai Butterweck, a writer for online German magazine Laut, gave I Am the Club Rocker a negative review, commenting that [...] "the scheme is the same in nearly all the songs: galloping offbeat-keyboards first meet with innovation loose beats, ere Inna's thin vocal organ moves the next three or four minutes on almost the same pitch". He further described the songs' rhymes as being [...] "cobbled together from a sixth graders' dictionary". Anna Julia Höhr, writing for the news agency Teleschau, similarly criticized the album, saying that the singer's tunes sound [...] "all the same" [...] and evaluating the record as [...] "disappointing". AllMusic's Jon O'Brien rated I Am the Club Rocker with two-and-a-half out of five stars, describing its songs as [...] "sun-soaked Europop tracks that appear destined to blare out of various Club 18-30 hotspots until the inevitable 6-a.m. stagger back to the hotel". He also criticized the use of Auto-Tune throughout the record and noticed major similarities between the album track [...] "Moon Girl" [...] and Katy Perry's [...] "California Gurls" [...] (2010). O'Brien went on say that Inna [...] "is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the record quickly {{if she wants to}} avoid the novelty-act fate of her homeland's formerly most famous pop export", asserting that I Am the Club Rocker was the first Romanian major contribution to the international pop music industry after the work of girl band The Cheeky Girls.|$|E
40|$|In late 2006, {{shortly before}} the end of his tenure as {{secretary}} of defense, Donald Rumsfeld made the following remark regarding the ongoing U. S. role in Iraq: “The biggest mistake would be not to pass things over to the Iraqis. It’s their country. They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> govern it. They’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> provide security for it. And they’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do it sooner rather than later. ” This remark is striking for its ahistorical crassness and demonstrated a striking amount of chutzpah even by Secretary Rumsfeld’s standards. However, it also raises some interesting questions about sovereignty and responsibility in foreign affairs...|$|R

2500|$|Howard's {{abilities}} and powerful physique have drawn attention from fellow NBA All-Stars. Tim Duncan once remarked in 2007: [...] " [...] is so developed...

[...] Subsequent to a game in the 2009 NBA Playoffs, Philadelphia 76ers swingman Andre Iguodala said: [...] "It's like he can guard two guys at once.

50|$|As for why so {{many people}} still resist what the facts clearly show, I think, in part, {{the reason is that the}} truth about the climate crisis is an {{inconvenient}} one that means we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the way we live our lives.|$|E
5000|$|Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales commented in an {{interview}} with The Independent: [...] "This only became a story because the footballer is pursuing legal action against Twitter.

500|$|The {{costs of}} filming Titanic {{eventually}} began to mount and finally reached $200million. Fox executives panicked and suggested {{an hour of}} specific cuts from the three-hour film.

Cameron refused, telling Fox, [...] "You want to cut my movie? You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fire me! You want to fire me?
