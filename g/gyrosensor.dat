40|$|The {{discrepancy}} between spatial orientations of an endoscopic image and a physician's working environment {{can make it}} difficult to interpret endoscopic images. In this study, we developed and evaluated a device that corrects the endoscopic image orientation using an accelerometer and <b>gyrosensor.</b> The acceleration of gravity and angular velocity were retrieved from the accelerometer and <b>gyrosensor</b> attached to the handle of the endoscope. The rotational angle of the endoscope handle was calculated using a Kalman filter with transmission delay compensation. Technical evaluation of the orientation correction system was performed using a camera by comparing the optical rotational angle from the captured image with the rotational angle calculated from the sensor outputs. For the clinical utility test, fifteen anesthesiology residents performed a video endoscopic examination of an airway model with and without using the orientation correction system. The participants reported numbers written on papers placed at the left main, right main, and right upper bronchi of the airway model. The correctness and the total time it took participants to report the numbers were recorded. During the technical evaluation, errors in the calculated rotational angle were less than 5 degrees. In the clinical utility test, there was a significant time reduction when using the orientation correction system compared with not using the system (median, 52 vs. 76 seconds; P =. 012). In this study, we developed a real-time endoscopic image orientation correction system, which significantly improved physician performance during a video endoscopic exam...|$|E
40|$|In the following, {{the main}} {{concepts}} {{of a road}} lane model are presented that keeps track of an arbitrary number of lane borders. Information from an existing lane detection device, a <b>gyrosensor,</b> and map data are merged and filtered to create a road model with a desired number of road lines. The model is based on clothoids and continuously provides positions, angles, and curvatures of the border lines of the vehicle’s own lane {{as well as of}} several neighboring lanes. Particularly on urban roads, in situations with upcoming turning lanes, or when the lane detection system fails to detect road lines, the model can still provide plausible information. This information significantly simplifies the situation analysis in further algorithms that rely on a lane detection system and require detailed information on current road lanes. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} falling risk among elderly using a wearable inertial sensor, {{which combines}} accelerometer and gyrosensors devices, applied during the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Subjects were categorised {{into two groups}} as low fall risk and high fall risk with 13. 5 s duration taken to complete the TUG test as the threshold between them. One sensor was attached at the subject's waist dorsally, while acceleration and <b>gyrosensor</b> signals in three directions were extracted during the test. The analysis {{was carried out in}} phases: sit-bend, bend-stand, walking, turning, stand-bend and bend-sit. Comparisons between the two groups showed that time parameters along with root mean square (RMS) value, amplitude and other parameters could reveal the activities in each phase. Classification using RMS value of angular velocity parameters for sit-stand phase, RMS value of acceleration for walking phase and amplitude of angular velocity signal for turning phase along with time parameters suggests that this is an improved method in evaluating fall risk, which promises benefits in terms of improvement of elderly quality of life...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} an embedded pedestrian navigation system {{composed of a}} self-contained sensors, the Global Positioning System (GPS) and an active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag system. We use self-contained sensors (accelerometers, <b>gyrosensors</b> and magnetometers) to estimate relative displacement by analyzing human walking locomotion. The GPS is used outdoors to adjust errors in position and direction accumulated by the dead-reckoning. In indoor environments, we use an active RFID tag system sparsely placed in key spot areas. The tag system obviously has limited availability and thus dead-reckoning is used to cover the environment. We propose a method of complementary compensation algorithm for the GPS/RFID localization and the selfcontained navigation represented by simple equations in a Kalman filter framework. Experimental results using the proposed method reveals that integration of GPS/RFID/dead-reckoning improve positioning accuracy in both indoor and outdoor environments. The pedestrian positioning is realized as a software module with the web-based APIs so that crossplatform development can easily be achieved. A pedestrian navigation system is implemented on an embedded wearable system and is proven to be useful even for unexperienced users. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Bradykinesia {{is one of}} the {{clinical}} hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and atypical Parkinsonian syndromes. Clinical ratings scales and technology based assessments have been developed to measure bradykinesia. We review the different tools that exist for measurement of bradykinesia and analyze their reliability and applicability to PD and atypical Parkinsonian syndromes. Methods: We summarize data on the factor structure of the two primary scales used to assess PD, the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Movement Disorder Society revision of the UPDRS, the MDS-UPDRS. We review how these scales have been used in atypical Parkinsonian syndromes, specifically Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). Finally, we report on the different technology based tools being used to assess bradykinesia. Results: The UPDRS is a useful measure of PD function and disability with 6 clinically distinct factors, 3 of which pertain to bradykinesia. The MDS-UPDRS has shown high internal consistency and correlation with the original UPDRS. Factor analysis of the UPDRS in PSP reveals 5 clinically distinct factors, 2 of which are independent bradykinesia factors. Thus the UPDRS and MDS-UPDRS are reliable and applicable scales for PD and the UPDRS can be used to assess bradykinesia in PSP. Technology based tools for measuring bradykinesia include <b>gyrosensors,</b> Coordination Ability Test System, Brain Test, quantitative digitography, Motus motion analysis system, PRIMAS, and the At-Home Testing Device. These tools have been compared to the UPDRS motor subscale and are effective in assessing bradykinesia. Conclusion: The UPDRS and MDS-UPDRS are well-established measures of bradykinesia that are applicable and useful in PD. The UPDRS is also been shown to be applicable to PSP. Different technologies exist to measure bradykinesia, though further work is needed to validate these assessment tools and bring them to clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis investigates sensor control in robotic surgery. At {{the present state}} of the art, robotic technology for surgical applications can broadly be divided into four main classes: • Robotic assistance • Remote-/teleoperated manipulators • Autonomous and image-guided robotic surgery • Micro-/nanorobotics The thesis describes {{some of the most important}} surgical robotic systems commercially available and some of the systems that are developed at leading academic institutions and research centres. Some selected academic work related to force measurements for force feedback and force control in robotic surgery is also described. The use of sensor control in surgical robotic systems is rather limited today compared to applications in industrial robotics and underwater telemanipulators. Therefore intuitive user interfaces with autonomous and semi-autonomous features are lacking in surgical robotic systems. A more intuitive and transparent user-interface is required to succeed with telemanipulation and robotic technology in surgery. The intuitiveness in the control of the manipulator alters the brain capacity left for the surgical procedure. In this connection, the way to interact with the manipulator and the level of interaction both play a role. The level of interaction varies depending on how much of the control is given to the physical user-interaction and how much that is left to the robot itself. This thesis describes the development of two systems that will improve user comfort and by thus make robotic surgery more widely available for more surgeons: 1. The development of a guided contour tracking system is presented. This system tracks an unknown contour or surface when physical contact is established. It is based on force measurements normal to the surface that the tool is in physical contact with. This system is proposed as a solution for remote-/telemanipulation of an ultrasound probe or any other tool to help maintaining physical contact with the patient’s skin. It could also be used to hold a grinding tool at a prescribed angle relative to a surface or follow an anatomical guide like the border between soft tissue and bone. The system can operate autonomously along the contour or be controlled interactively through a steering console by changing the tracking speed, the tracking direction and orientation of the tracking tool. 2. The development of a head tracking system for intuitive control of a stereo camera held by a robot is presented. This system will alter the viewing direction of the camera as a function of the surgeon’s head movements. The head motion is measured through piezoelectric <b>gyrosensors.</b> In key-hole surgery systems at present the use of stereoscopic videocamera and head-mounted display (HMD) usually makes the surgeon motion sick or makes him/her move the head in awkward positions in order to keep the visual target in the centre of the video image. The system that has been developed will make the change of camera view more intuitive and less stressing. A user comparison test has been performed to compare the proposed HeadTracking system with a voice control system and a head control system, later referred to as the HeadCommand and VoiceCommand system respectively. The guided contour tracking system was implemented and tested on a MultiCraft 560 robot. The standard control system of MultiCraft 560 was extended with an active force control system which the contour tracking system was based on. The experiments showed that the system performed well and had a sufficient accuracy for the tested applications. The HeadTracking system was developed in four steps where different sensor signal interfaces to the robotic system were explored. The final prototype was implemented and tested on the robotic scopeholder Aesop 3000 DS. The performance of the system was sufficient and made the user feel like having the camera attached his/her nose when moving the head. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
