5|$|The {{cemetery}} grounds are, {{except in}} drier climates, grass {{covered with a}} floral border around the headstones. There is also an absence of any paving between the headstone rows which is intended to make the cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors could experience a sense of peace. However, Carter and Jackson argue that the uniform aesthetics are designed to <b>evoke</b> <b>a</b> positive experience which deliberately masks and sanitises {{the nature of the}} war deaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} {{attempted to}} limit the use of digital effects. However, {{because he wanted to}} <b>evoke</b> <b>a</b> Southern Gothic fantasy tone for Big Fish, color grading techniques were applied by Sony Pictures Imageworks. Stan Winston Studios, with whom Burton worked with on Edward Scissorhands (1990) and Batman Returns (1992), designed Helena Bonham Carter's prosthetic makeup and created the animatronics. Scenes with Karl the Giant were commissioned using forced perspective filmmaking.|$|E
5|$|At age 16 Mendelssohn {{wrote his}} String Octet in E-flat major, the first work which showed the full {{power of his}} genius. This Octet and his Overture to Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, which he wrote a year later in 1826, are the best-known of his early works. (Later, in 1842, he also wrote {{incidental}} music for the play, including the famous Wedding March.) The Overture is perhaps the earliest example of a concert overture– that is, a piece not written deliberately to accompany a staged performance, but to <b>evoke</b> <b>a</b> literary theme in performance on a concert platform; this was a genre which became a popular form in musical Romanticism.|$|E

5|$|On August 3, 2010, Masuda {{announced}} on his blog that the Black and White game versions will initially only contain brand-new Pokémon to <b>evoke</b> <b>a</b> feeling {{of it being}} a brand-new game, like when the original Pokémon games were first released. In all of the games following the first generation, there were a series of new Pokémon introduced interspersed with Pokémon from the previous generations. For example, Pikachu was introduced in Red and Green, and was obtainable in Blue, Yellow, and all subsequent main series games; however, Pikachu will not be obtainable in Black and White {{from the start of}} the game. It was later confirmed that Black and White are region locked on the Nintendo DSi and 3DS.|$|E
5|$|After the Deluge, {{also known}} as The Forty-First Day, is a Symbolist oil {{painting}} by English artist George Frederic Watts, first exhibited as The Sun in an incomplete form in 1886 and completed in 1891. It shows {{a scene from the}} story of Noah's Flood, in which after 40 days of rain Noah opens the window of his Ark to see that the rain has stopped. Watts felt that modern society was in decline owing to a lack of moral values, and he often painted works on the topic of the Flood and its cleansing of the unworthy from the world. The painting {{takes the form of a}} stylised seascape, dominated by a bright sunburst breaking through clouds. Although this was a theme Watts had depicted previously in The Genius of Greek Poetry in 1878, After the Deluge took a radically different approach. With this painting he intended to <b>evoke</b> <b>a</b> monotheistic God in the act of creation, but avoid depicting the Creator directly.|$|E
5|$|As social centres castles were {{important}} places for display. Builders {{took the opportunity}} to draw on symbolism, through the use of motifs, to <b>evoke</b> <b>a</b> sense of chivalry that was aspired to in the Middle Ages amongst the elite. Later structures of the Romantic Revival would draw on elements of castle architecture such as battlements for the same purpose. Castles have been compared with cathedrals as objects of architectural pride, and some castles incorporated gardens as ornamental features. The right to crenellate, when granted by a monarch– though it was not always necessary– was important not just as it allowed a lord to defend his property but because crenellations and other accoutrements associated with castles were prestigious through their use by the elite. Licences to crenellate were also proof of a relationship with or favour from the monarch, who was the one responsible for granting permission.|$|E

5|$|Production {{began in}} late 2003 at Barrandov Studios in Prague, Czech Republic, {{where most of}} the filming took place. Production {{designer}} Richard Bridgland was in charge of sets, props and vehicles, based on early concept art Anderson had created to give a broad direction of how things would look. 25 to 30 life-sized sets were constructed at Barrandov Studios, many of which were interiors of the pyramid. The pyramid's carvings, sculptures, and hieroglyphs were influenced by Egyptian, Cambodian, and Aztec civilisations, while the regular shifting of the pyramid's rooms was meant to <b>evoke</b> <b>a</b> sense of claustrophobia similar to the original Alien film. According to Anderson, if he was to build the sets in Los Angeles they would have cost $20 million. However, in Prague they cost $2 million, an important factor when the film's budget was less than $50 million.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} features architecture {{intended to}} <b>evoke</b> <b>a</b> sense of calm. It was constructed {{with a central}} courtyard {{and a number of}} windows overlooking it, as well as nature-related artwork and architecture. There are also separate hallways for staff and visitors {{in order to make the}} interior appear less crowded. The hospital also features a substantial amount of parking and a shuttle service to the entrance. Miami Valley Hospital South was constructed with future expansion in mind. Two of the five floors in the patient wing are empty and can be filled adding 24 beds each. A third hallway can be added to the wing which will add 60 beds, and the maternity ward can also be expanded with a second floor to add 12 beds, which means the facility could be expanded to 180 beds.|$|E
25|$|Liszt's own {{point of}} view {{regarding}} programme music can for the time of his youth be taken from the preface of the Album d'un voyageur (1837). According to this, a landscape could <b>evoke</b> <b>a</b> certain kind of mood. Since a piece of music could also <b>evoke</b> <b>a</b> mood, a mysterious resemblance with the landscape could be imagined. In this sense the music would not paint the landscape, but it would match the landscape in a third category, the mood.|$|E

Whereas previous research focused on the informational inferences that bargainers make based on others' emotions, this article {{emphasizes the importance of}} affective reactions. The findings of this study show that anger <b>evoked</b> <b>a</b> complementary emotion (fear) in targets when reported by a high-power bargainer but <b>evoked</b> <b>a</b> reciprocal emotion (anger) when reported by a low-power bargainer. This reciprocal anger led participants to offer less to low-power counterparts who reported anger. Disappointed bargainers, however, <b>evoked</b> <b>a</b> complementary emotion (guilt) in participants and increased offers, regardless of the bargainer's power position...|$|R

40|$|This {{study used}} {{kinematics}} {{to investigate the}} integration between vision and olfaction during grasping movements. Participants were requested to smell an odorant and then grasp an object presented in central vision. The results indicate that if the target was small (e. g., a strawberry), the time and amplitude of maximum hand aperture were later and greater, respectively, when the odor <b>evoked</b> <b>a</b> larger object (e. g., an orange) than when the odor <b>evoked</b> <b>an</b> object of a similar size as the target or no odor was presented. Conversely, the time and amplitude of maximum hand aperture were earlier and reduced, respectively, when the target was large (e. g., a peach) and the odor <b>evoked</b> <b>a</b> smaller sized object (e. g., an almond) than when the odor <b>evoked</b> <b>an</b> object of a similar size as the target or no odor was presented. Taken together, these results support the evidence of cross-modal links between olfaction and vision and extend this notion to goal-directed actions...|$|R
25|$|The second logo {{adopted a}} blue {{triangle}} (with the bottom point missing) {{and a red}} triangle superimposed upon it, enclosed by a circle; this was meant to <b>evoke</b> <b>a</b> vertically-displayed national flag (the white being formed by the negative space between the two triangles' tips). In the mid-1970s, a third logo, which removed the circle and simplified the shapes, was introduced. The typeface used in the third logo was later applied to the second logo, which remained the official PAL logo until 1986, {{when it would be}} replaced by the current logo.|$|E
25|$|In England {{from the}} 1630s, under the {{influence}} of literature and especially court masques, Anthony van Dyck and his followers created a fashion for having one's portrait painted in exotic, historical or pastoral dress, or in simplified contemporary fashion with various scarves, cloaks, mantles, and jewels added to <b>evoke</b> <b>a</b> classic or romantic mood, and also to prevent the portrait appearing dated within a few years. These paintings are the progenitors of the fashion of the later 17th century for having one's portrait painted in undress, and do not necessarily reflect clothing as it was actually worn.|$|E
25|$|After Manet's {{death the}} two {{pictures}} hung {{on either side}} of the 1877 painting Jean-Baptiste Faure in the Role of Hamlet. From this arrangement Stoichiţă concludes that the choice of this Spanish influenced painting was meant to <b>evoke</b> <b>a</b> renewed parallel to Velázquez. Another message derived from the juxtaposition is that the self-portraits could almost be read as Manet in the Role of Manet. Juliet Wilson-Bareau, however, points out that Manet probably did not intend the pictures to be so displayed, as it was Léon Leenhoff who had the pictures framed and hung them {{on either side of}} the Faure portrait.|$|E

25|$|This {{style was}} admired by Mackintosh because of: its {{restraint}} and economy of means rather than ostentatious accumulation; its simple forms and natural materials rather than elaboration and artifice; {{the use of}} texture and light and shadow rather than pattern and ornament. In the old western style, furniture was seen as ornament that displayed the wealth of its owner {{and the value of}} the piece was established according to the length of time spent creating it. In the Japanese arts furniture and design focused {{on the quality of the}} space, which was meant to <b>evoke</b> <b>a</b> calming and organic feeling to the interior.|$|E
25|$|Hogwarts {{grew and}} {{expanded}} significantly {{with the third}} film. For the first time, the Hogwarts courtyard and bridge were seen. At {{the end of the}} bridge, rock monoliths were placed onto the hillside to <b>evoke</b> <b>a</b> Celtic feeling. The use of live-action also significantly changed the look of Hagrid's hut. In the first two films, it appeared {{at the end of a}} flat stretch, right in front of the Forbidden Forest. The third film utilised the more rugged Scottish locations to place Hagrid's hut at the bottom of a steep hillside. A large pumpkin patch was added behind the hut.|$|E
25|$|Although Chapman was not {{the first}} to create museum dioramas, he was {{responsible}} for many of the innovations that would separate and eventually define the dioramas in the American Museum. Whereas other dioramas of the time period typically featured generic scenery, Chapman was the first to bring artists into the field with him in the hopes of capturing a specific location at a specific time. In contrast to the dramatic scenes later created by Carl Akeley for the African Hall, Chapman wanted his dioramas to <b>evoke</b> <b>a</b> scientific realism, ultimately serving as a historical record of habitats and species facing a high probability of extinction.|$|E
