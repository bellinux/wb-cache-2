From the mesoblast the muscles, the dermis genital and excretory organs, circulatory fluid and apparatus, any skeletal structures; and all connective tissue are derived. The mass {{of the body is}} thus evidently made of mesoblast. The <b>hypoblast</b> is the lining of the intestine and of the glands which open into it; and the material of the notochord is also regarded, as <b>hypoblast.</b>|$|E

60|$|Section 22. Figure 9 ii. shows all the {{essential}} {{points of the}} structure of amphioxus. Epiblast is indicated by a line of dashes, mesoblast by dots, and <b>hypoblast,</b> dark or black. The true mouth is formed late by a tucking-in of epiblast, the stomodaeum (s.d.), which meets and fuses with the <b>hypoblast,</b> and is then perforated. The position of this mouth is at the velum. The formation of the atrium has been described. The metapleural folds run forward in front of the velum, as the epipleurs (ep. in Sections 1 and 2), and form an oral hood (b.c.), around which the tentacles appear, and which is evidently not equivalent to the vertebrate mouth cavity, but in front of and outside it. The anus is formed by a tucking in, the proctodaeum, similar to the stomodaeum.|$|E

60|$|In certain animals {{belonging}} to {{every one of}} the chief groups into which the Metazoa are divisible, the cells of the cell-aggregate which results from the process of yelk-division, and which is termed a morula, diverge from one another in such a manner as to give rise to a central space, around which they dispose themselves as a coat or envelope; and thus the morula becomes a vesicle filled with fluid, the planula. The wall of the planula is next pushed in on one side, or invaginated, whereby it is converted into a double-walled sac with an opening, the blastopore, which leads into the cavity lined by the inner wall. This cavity is the primitive alimentary cavity or archenteron; the inner or invaginated layer is the hypoblast; the outer the epiblast; and the embryo, in this stage, is termed a gastrula. In all the higher animals a layer of cells makes its appearance between the <b>hypoblast</b> and the epiblast, and is termed the mesoblast. In the further course of development the epiblast becomes the ectoderm or epidermic layer of the body; the <b>hypoblast</b> becomes the epithelium of the middle portion of the alimentary canal; and the mesoblast gives rise to all the other tissues, except the central nervous system, which originates from an ingrowth of the epiblast.|$|E
60|$|Though {{it would}} enforce the argument, I must, for brevity's sake, {{pass over the}} {{analogous}} evolution of that introverted layer, or <b>hypoblast,</b> out of which the alimentary canal and attached organs arise. It will suffice to emphasize the fact that having been originally external, this layer continues in its developed form to have a quasi-externality, alike in its digesting part and in its respiratory part; since it continues to deal with matters alien to the organism. I must also refrain from dwelling at length on the fact already adverted to, that the intermediate derived layer, or mesoblast, which was at the outset completely internal, originates those structures which ever remain completely internal, and have no communication with the environment save through the structures developed from the other two: an antithesis which has great significance.|$|E
60|$|Section 34. With the {{exception}} of the reduction of the pronephros, what has been said of the development of the frog's nervous system, renal and reproductive organs, and skeleton, applies sufficiently to the fowl for our present purposes. The entire separation of Wolffian and Mullerian ducts {{from the very beginning of}} development is here beyond all question (vide Section 18). But the notochord in the fowl is not so distinctly connected with the <b>hypoblast,</b> and so distinct from the mesoblast, as it is in the lower type, and no gills, internal or external, are ever developed. The gill slits occur with a modification due to the slitting and flattening out of the embryo, already insisted upon; for, whereas in the tadpole they may be described as perforations, in the fowl they appear as four notches between ingrowing processes that are endeavouring to meet in the middle line.|$|E
60|$|Section 7. The ovum next {{begins to}} divide. A furrow cutting {{deeper and deeper}} divides it into two; another follows {{at right angles to}} this, making the two four, and another {{equatorial}} furrow cuts off the animal pole from the yolk or vegetative pole. (See Sheet 22, Figures 1, 2, and 3.) And so segmentation (= cleavage) proceeds, and, at last, a hollow sphere, the blastosphere (Figure 4) is formed, with a segmentation cavity (s.c.). But, {{because of the presence of}} the yolk at the vegetative pole of ovum, and of the mechanical resistance it offers to the force of segmentation, the protoplasm there is not nearly so finely divided-- the cells, that is to say, are much larger than at the animal pole. The blastosphere of the frog is like what the blastosphere of amphioxus would be, if the future <b>hypoblast</b> cells were enormously larger through their protoplasm being diluted with yolk.|$|E
6000|$|Take a small india-rubber ball--not of the {{inflated}} kind, nor of {{the solid}} kind, but of the kind about {{an inch or so}} in diameter with a small hole through which, under pressure, the air escapes. Suppose that instead of consisting of india-rubber its wall consists of small cells made polyhedral in form by mutual pressure, and united together. This will represent the blastoderm. Now with the finger, thrust in one side of the ball until it touches the other: so making a cup. This action will stand for the process of invagination. Imagine that by continuance of it, the hemispherical cup becomes very much deepened and the opening narrowed, until the cup becomes a sac, of which the introverted wall is everywhere in contact with the outer wall. This will represent the two-layered [...] "gastrula"--the simplest ancestral form of the Metazoa: a form which is permanently represented in some of the lowest types; for it needs but tentacles round the mouth of the sac, to produce a common hydra. Here the fact which it chiefly concerns us to remark, is that of these two layers the outer, called in embryological language the epiblast, continues to carry on direct converse with the forces and matters in the environment; while the inner, called the <b>hypoblast,</b> comes in contact with such only of these matters as are put into the food-cavity which it lines. We have further to note that in the embryos of Metazoa at all advanced in organization, there arises between these two layers a third--the mesoblast. The origin of this is seen in types where the developmental process is not obscured by the presence of a large food-yolk. While the above-described introversion is taking place, and before the inner surfaces of the resulting epiblast and <b>hypoblast</b> have come into contact, cells, or amoeboid units equivalent to them, are budded off from one or both of these inner surfaces, or some part of one or other; and these form a layer which eventually lies between the other two--a layer which, as this mode of formation implies, never has any converse with the surrounding medium and its contents, or with the nutritive bodies taken in from it. The striking facts to which this description is a necessary introduction, may now be stated. From the outer layer, or epiblast, are developed the permanent epidermis and its out-growths, the nervous system, and the organs of sense. From the introverted layer, or <b>hypoblast,</b> are developed the alimentary canal and those parts of its appended organs, liver, pancreas, &c., which are concerned in delivering their secretions into the alimentary canal, as well as the linings of those ramifying tubes in the lungs which convey air to the places where gaseous exchange is effected. And from the mesoblast originate the bones, the muscles, the heart and blood-vessels, and the lymphatics, together with such parts of various internal organs as are most remotely concerned with the outer world. Minor qualifications being admitted, there remain the broad general facts, that out of that part of the external layer which remains permanently external, are developed all the structures which carry on intercourse with the medium and its contents, active and passive; out of the introverted part of this external layer, are developed the structures which carry on intercourse with the quasi-external substances that are taken into the interior--solid food, water, and air; while out of the mesoblast are developed structures which have never had, from first to last, any intercourse with the environment. Let us contemplate these general facts.|$|E
50|$|The {{thickening}} of the epiblast in Koller's sickle acts as {{a margin}} separating sheets of cells from posterior side of avian blastoderms from hypoblasts and area opaca endoderm. The blastoderm is a single layer of cells, and the <b>hypoblast</b> and area opaca endoderm cells lie directly below the blastoderm. Koller's sickle arises from the midpoint, between the <b>hypoblast</b> cells and the area opaca endoderm. As blastoderm cells migrate anteriorly they push primary <b>hypoblast</b> cells and form a secondary <b>hypoblast</b> known as the endoblast. Also during this migration, Koller's sickle prevents the <b>hypoblast</b> cells and the area opaca cells from making contact with the blastoderm, which allows the primitive streak to form.|$|E
50|$|In {{mammalian}} embryogenesis, differentiation and {{segregation of}} cells composing the {{inner cell mass}} of the blastocyst yields two distinct layers—the epiblast ("primitive ectoderm") and the <b>hypoblast</b> ("primitive endoderm"). While the cuboidal <b>hypoblast</b> cells delaminate ventrally, away from the embryonic pole, to line the blastocoele, the remaining cells of the inner cell mass, situated between the <b>hypoblast</b> and the polar trophoblast, become the epiblast and comprise columnar cells.|$|E
50|$|Extraembryonic {{endoderm}} (including Yolk sac) {{is derived}} from <b>hypoblast</b> cells. The absence of <b>hypoblast</b> results in multiple primitive streaks in chicken embryos. The formation of the primitive streak, through which gastrulation occurs, is induced by Koller's sickle.|$|E
5000|$|Nodal, a known {{mesoderm}}al inducer of the TGFB superfamily, {{has been}} implicated in streak formation. Mouse embryos mutant for Nodal fail to gastrulate and lack most mesoderm, but more than {{playing a role in}} mesoderm induction, Nodal regulates the induction and/or maintenance of the primitive streak. In the presence of <b>hypoblast,</b> Nodal is unable to induce ectopic streaks in the chick embryo, while its removal, induces expression of Nodal, Chordin and Brachyury, suggesting that the <b>hypoblast</b> must have a certain inhibitory effect on Nodal signaling. Indeed, the multifunctional antagonist of Nodal, Wnt and BMP signaling, Cerberus (produced in the <b>hypoblast)</b> and Cerberus-Short (which inhibits only Nodal), through its effect on Nodal signaling, inhibits streak formation. Eventually, the <b>hypoblast</b> gets displaced anteriorly by the moving endoblast, allowing streak formation at the posterior end. At the anterior end, the presence of the <b>hypoblast</b> and the antagonists it secretes, such as Cerberus, inhibit the expression of Nodal and hence restrict streak formation to the posterior end only. Similarly to the <b>hypoblast</b> in chick, the AVE in the mouse secretes two antagonists of Nodal signaling, Cerberus-like, Cerl, and Lefty1. In mouse, Cer-/-; Lefty1-/- double mutants develop multiple streaks [...] as indicated by ectopic expression of Brachyury and can be partially rescued by the removal of one copy of the Nodal gene. In the mouse, the AVE restricts streak formation through the redundant functions of Cer1 and Lefty1, which negatively regulate Nodal signaling. The role of the mouse’s AVE in ensuring the formation of a single primitive streak is evolutionarily conserved in the <b>hypoblast</b> of the chick.|$|E
50|$|Underlying the epiblast is the <b>hypoblast,</b> {{where the}} extra-embryonic tissue originates. In the chick, {{the absence of}} the <b>hypoblast</b> results in {{multiple}} streaks, suggesting that its presence is important for regulating the formation of a single primitive streak. In mice, this structure is known as the Anterior Visceral Endoderm (AVE).|$|E

50|$|The {{yolk sac}} starts forming {{during the second}} week of the {{embryonic}} development, {{at the same time as}} the shaping of the amniotic sac. The <b>hypoblast</b> starts proliferating laterally and descending. In the meantime Heuser's membrane, located on the opposite pole of the developing vesicle, starts its upward proliferation and meets the <b>hypoblast.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{formation}} of the primitive streak relies on a complex network of signaling pathways that work together {{to ensure that this}} process is highly regulated. Activation of various secreted factors (Vg1, Nodal, Wnt8C, FGF8 and Chordin) and transcription factors (Brachyury and Goosecoid) adjacent to the site of streak formation is required for this process.In addition, structures such as the <b>hypoblast</b> also {{play an important role in}} the regulation of streak formation. Removal of the <b>hypoblast</b> in the chick results in correctly patterned ectopic streaks, suggesting that the <b>hypoblast</b> serves to inhibit {{formation of}} the primitive streak.|$|E
50|$|The embryoblast {{forms an}} {{embryonic}} disc, {{which is a}} bilaminar disc of two layers, an upper layer called the epiblast (primitive ectoderm) and a lower layer called the <b>hypoblast</b> (primitive endoderm). The disc is stretched between what will become the amniotic cavity and the yolk sac. The epiblast is adjacent to the trophoblast and made of columnar cells; the <b>hypoblast</b> is closest to the blastocyst cavity and made of cuboidal cells. The epiblast migrates away from the trophoblast downwards, forming the amniotic cavity, the lining of which is formed from amnioblasts developed from the epiblast. The <b>hypoblast</b> is pushed down and forms the yolk sac (exocoelomic cavity) lining. Some <b>hypoblast</b> cells migrate along the inner cytotrophoblast lining of the blastocoel, secreting an extracellular matrix along the way. These <b>hypoblast</b> cells and extracellular matrix are called Heuser's membrane (or the exocoelomic membrane), and they cover the blastocoel to form the yolk sac (or exocoelomic cavity). Cells of the epiblast migrate along the outer edges of this reticulum and form the extraembryonic mesoderm; this disrupts the extraembryonic reticulum. Soon pockets form in the reticulum, which ultimately coalesce to form the chorionic cavity or extraembryonic coelom.|$|E
50|$|Once {{blastoderm}} {{cells have}} covered {{almost half of}} the yolk cell, thickening throughout the margin of deep cells occurs. The thickening {{is referred to as the}} germ ring and is made up of a superficial layer, the epiblast which will become ectoderm, and an inner layer called the <b>hypoblast</b> which will become endoderm and mesoderm. As the blastoderm cells undergo epiboly around the yolk the internalization of cells at the blastoderm margin start to form <b>hypoblast.</b> Presumpive ectoderm or epiblast cells do not interalize but the deep cells (inner layer of cells) do and they become the mesoderm and endoderm. As the <b>hypoblast</b> cells move inward future mesoderm (<b>hypoblast</b> cells) start to move vegetally and proliferate but later in development these cells alter their direction and start moving towards the animal pole. However, endodermal precursors seem to lack a pattern and move randomly over the yolk.|$|E
50|$|Heuser's {{membrane}} (or the exocoelomic membrane) {{is a short}} lived {{combination of}} <b>hypoblast</b> cells and extracellular matrix.|$|E
50|$|Although the <b>hypoblast</b> {{does not}} {{contribute}} to the embryo, it has great influences on the orientation of the embryonic axis. For example, the AVE in <b>hypoblast</b> {{plays an important role in}} positioning the primitive streak at the midland of the amniote embryos. In chick, people had observed that removal of the <b>hypoblast</b> caused multiple, ectopic primitive streaks formation. Similarly, in mice embryo, the AVE expresses secreted molecules, including two antagonists of nodal signaling, Cerberus-like (Cerl) and a TGFβ superfamily molecule, Lefty1. It was shown that Cerberus−/−;Lefty1−/− compound mutants mice developed a primitive streak ectopically in the embryo. There is also finding suggested that the <b>hypoblast</b> also inhibit primitive streak formation by depositing extracellular matrix components to inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Besides the role of positioning the site of gastulation, AVE also showed other function including continued protection against caudalization of the early nervous system. Also primitive endoderm derived yolk sac has major function in guaranteeing the proper organogenesis of the fetus and efficient exchange of nutrients, gases and wastes.|$|E
50|$|The epiblast {{forms the}} floor of the amniotic cavity and is {{continuous}} peripherally with the amnion. The <b>hypoblast</b> forms the roof of the exocoelomic cavity and is continuous with the thin exocoelomic membrane. This membrane along with <b>hypoblast</b> forms the primary yolk sac. The embryonic disc now lies between the amniotic cavity and the primary yolk sac. Cells from the yolk sac endoderm form a layer of connective tissue, the extraembryonic mesoderm, which surrounds the amnion and yolk sac.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hypoblast</b> is {{a tissue}} type that forms {{from the inner}} cell mass. It lies beneath the epiblast and {{consists}} of small cuboidal cells.|$|E
50|$|A blastocoel is a fluid-filled cavity {{that forms}} in the animal {{hemisphere}} of early amphibian and echinoderm embryos, or between the epiblast and <b>hypoblast</b> of avian, reptilian, and mammalian blastoderm-stage embryos.|$|E
5000|$|Bilaminar {{blastocyst}} or Bilaminar disc {{refers to}} the [...] epiblast and the <b>hypoblast,</b> evolved from the embryoblast. These two layers are sandwiched between two balloons: the primitive yolk sac and the amniotic cavity.|$|E
50|$|Primary yolk sac: {{it is the}} vesicle which {{develops}} in the second week, its floor is represented by Heuser's membrane and its ceiling by the <b>hypoblast.</b> It {{is also known as}} the exocoelomic cavity.|$|E
50|$|The ICM and the TE will {{generate}} distinctly different cell types as implantation starts and embryogenesis continues. Trophectoderm cells form extraembryonic tissues, which {{act in a}} supporting role for the embryo proper. Furthermore, these cells pump fluid into {{the interior of the}} blastocyst, causing the formation of a polarized blastocyst with the ICM attached to the trophectoderm at one end (see figure). This difference in cellular localization causes the ICM cells exposed to the fluid cavity to adopt a primitive endoderm (or <b>hypoblast)</b> fate, while the remaining cells adopt a primitive ectoderm (or epiblast) fate. The <b>hypoblast</b> contributes to extraembryonic membranes and the epiblast will give rise to the ultimate embryo proper as well as some extraembryonic tissues.|$|E
50|$|In humans, {{after about}} three days, the zygote forms a solid mass of cells by mitotic division, called a morula. This then changes to a blastocyst, {{consisting}} of an outer layer called a trophoblast, and an {{inner cell mass}} called the embryoblast. Filled with uterine fluid, the blastocyst breaks out of the zona pellucida and undergoes implantation. The inner cell mass initially has two layers: the <b>hypoblast</b> and epiblast. At {{the end of the}} second week, a primitive streak appears. The epiblast in this region moves towards the primitive streak, dives down into it, and forms a new layer, called the endoderm, pushing the <b>hypoblast</b> out of the way (this goes on to form the amnion.) The epiblast keeps moving and forms a second layer, the mesoderm. The top layer is now called the ectoderm.|$|E
50|$|During {{formation}} of the primitive yolk sac, some of the migrating <b>hypoblast</b> cells differentiate into mesenchymal cells that fill the space between Heuser's membrane and the Trophoblast, forming the extraembryonic mesoderm. As development progresses, small lacunae begin to form within the extraembryonic mesoderm which enlarge to become the extraembryonic coelom.|$|E
50|$|The zygote first {{transformed}} into a morula through cleavage and then more divisions lead to a blastocyst that consisted of just a trophoblast, and an embryoblast. By {{the end of the}} first week, the embryoblast has begun separating into two layers: the epiblast and <b>hypoblast</b> also called the primitive endoderm. At the embryonic pole of the blastocyst, the amniotic cavity finds a home between the epiblast and the trophoblast. The epiblast stretches to surround the cavity very quickly and this layer of the epiblast becomes known as the amnion, which is one of the four extraembryonic membranes. The rest of the <b>hypoblast</b> and epiblast, not including the amnion, is what contributes to the bilaminar embryonic disc (bilaminar blastoderm/blastocyst), which sits between the amniotic cavity and the blastocyst cavity. The embryo proper and extramembryonic membranes are later derived from the embryonic disc.|$|E
50|$|At day 9-10 of {{embryonic}} development, {{cells from the}} <b>hypoblast</b> begin to migrate to the embryonic pole, forming a layer of cells just beneath the cytotrophoblast, called Heuser's Membrane. It surrounds the exocoelomic cavity (primitive yolk sac), i.e. it lines the inner surface of the cytotrophoblast. At this point, the exocoelomic cavity replaces the blastocyst cavity.|$|E
50|$|The {{formation}} of the chorionic cavity (Extra-embryonic coelom) and the yolk sac (umbilical vesicle) is still up for debate. The thought of how the yolk sac membranes are formed begins {{with an increase in}} production of <b>hypoblast</b> cells, succeeded by different patterns of migration. On day 8, the first portion of <b>hypoblast</b> cells begin their migration and make {{what is known as the}} primary yolk sac, or Heuser's membrane (exocoelomic membrane). By day 12, the primary yolk sac has been disestablished by a new batch of migrating <b>hypoblast</b> cells that now contribute to the definitive yolk sac. While the primary yolk sac is forming, extraembryonic mesoderm makes its way into the blastocyst cavity to fill it with loosely packed cells. When the extraembryonic mesoderm is separated into two portions, a new gap arises called the chorionic cavity, or the extra-embryonic coelom. This new cavity is responsible for detaching the embryo and its amnion and yolk sac from the far wall of the blastocyst, which is now named the chorion. When the extraembryonic mesoderm splits into two layers, the amnion, yolk sac, and chorion follow its lead and also become double layered. The chorion and amnion are composed of extraembryonic ectoderm and mesoderm, where as the yolk sac is made of extraembryonic endoderm and mesoderm. When day 13 rolls around, the connecting stalk, a dense portion of extraembryonic mesoderm, restrains the embryonic disc in the chorionic cavity.|$|E
50|$|On day 16, epiblast {{cells that}} are next to the {{primitive}} streak experience epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation as they ingress through the primitive streak. The first wave of epiblast cells takes over the <b>hypoblast,</b> which slowly becomes replaced by new cells that eventually constitute the definitive endoderm. The definitive endoderm {{is what makes the}} lining of the gut and other associated gut structures.|$|E
50|$|Any given slice {{from the}} {{blastoderm}} {{is able to}} generate a complete axis until the time of gastrulation and primitive streak formation. This ability to generate a streak from the pre-streak stage chick embryo indicates {{that there must be}} a mechanism to ensure that only a single streak forms. The <b>hypoblast</b> secretes an antagonist of Nodal that prevents ectopic streak formation in the chick.|$|E
5000|$|The {{yolk sac}} is a {{membranous}} [...] attached to an embryo, formed by {{cells of the}} <b>hypoblast</b> adjacent to the embryonic disk. This is alternatively called the umbilical vesicle by the Terminologia Embryologica (TE), though yolk sac is far more widely used. The yolk sac is important in early embryonic blood supply, {{and much of it}} is incorporated into the primordial gut during the fourth week of development.|$|E
