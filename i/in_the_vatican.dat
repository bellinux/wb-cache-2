5|$|Another {{attack was}} made in 1521 by Paulus Bombasius, the prefect of the Vatican Library, because in Greek text Erasmus {{departed}} from the common readings of the Vulgate. He informed Erasmus that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> Library is held an extremely ancient copy of the Scriptures (i.e. Codex Vaticanus). He sent two extracts from this manuscript containing 1 John 4:1-3 and 1 John 5:7-11 (it did not include Comma).|$|E

50|$|Beginning <b>in</b> 1967, <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> began issuing coins using roman numerals for {{the year}} of issue, {{as opposed to the}} more common Arabic numerals.|$|R
5|$|Before {{passing through}} the Vatican City walls and {{terminating}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> City railway station, the line passes under an arch decorated with the Coat of Arms of Pope Pius XI with a two-piece 35.5 ton iron gate which slides into the recesses of the Vatican walls. The gate is closed {{when there is no}} traffic scheduled on the line.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the nativity scene {{featured}} seventeen new {{figures of}} spruce on loan to the Vatican from sculptors and wood sawyers {{of the town}} of Tesero, Italy in the Italian Alps. The figures included peasants, a flutist, a bagpipe player and a shepherd named Titaoca. Twelve nativity scenes created before 1800 from Tesero were put on display <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> audience hall.|$|E
5|$|In several passages, {{he gives}} proof of {{independent}} observation (XXXIV:38, 46, 63, XXXV:17, 20, 116 seq.). He prefers the marble Laocoön and his Sons {{in the palace}} of Titus (widely {{believed to be the}} statue that is now <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican)</b> to all the pictures and bronzes in the world (XXXVI:37). The statue is attributed by Pliny to three sculptors from the island of Rhodes: Agesander, Athenodoros (possibly son of Agesander) and Polydorus.|$|E

5|$|Literary {{activity}} also flourished {{during the}} reign of Ivan Alexander. Several important literary works were created in the period, such as the Middle Bulgarian translation of the Manasses Chronicle (1344–1345), currently preserved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> Secret Archives in Rome, the richly illustrated Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander (1355–1356), now exhibited in the British Library, the Tomić Psalter (1360), today in Moscow, and the Sofia Psalter (1337).|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, {{there are}} four known {{surviving}} manuscripts containing the fatwa. One of them is an Arabic copy, discovered by Muhammad Abdullah 'Inan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> in 1951 and kept in the Borgiano collection of the Vatican Library. The other three were translations to Spanish written in the Arabic script (aljamiado). One of them was kept in Aix-en-Provence, France, and one in Madrid, Spain. The third aljamiado translation {{used to be in}} Madrid, but its location is currently unknown.|$|E
5|$|Both popes were consecrated and crowned on {{the same}} day, February 23. Innocent II {{received}} episcopal consecration from Cardinal Giovanni of Ostia in the church S. Maria Nuova, the titular deaconry of Chancellor Aymeric. Anacletus II was consecrated by Cardinal Pietro of Porto <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> Basilica, which means that Anacletus took the advantage in the city from the very beginning. Almost all Roman aristocracy (with the significant exception of the Frangipani family), {{the majority of the}} lesser clergy and the people of Rome recognized Anacletus II {{and at the end of}} May Innocent II had to flee to France. After his defection to France even the Frangipani submitted to Anacletus.|$|E
50|$|He {{took part}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Second <b>Vatican</b> Council {{where he was}} a member of the Commission on Canon Law.|$|R

25|$|<b>In</b> 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> beatified 498 priests {{killed by}} the Republican army during the civil war. Relatives of Republican {{religious}} {{killed by the}} Nationalists have requested similar recognition, criticizing the unequal treatment.|$|R
5|$|Several {{churches and}} palaces, {{including}} Saint Mark's Basilica, were looted by the French, which outraged the Italians and their artistic and cultural sensibilities. In 1797, the Treaty of Tolentino {{was signed by}} Napoleon, and two statues, the Nile and Tiber, were taken to Paris. These statues had previously been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican,</b> and both were housed in the Louvre until 1815. After the defeat of Napoleon, the Nile was returned to Italy. However, the Tiber remained in the Louvre Museum and {{can be seen in}} the collections today.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church, {{also known}} as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.29billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest {{religious}} institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history and development of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the Pope, the church's doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. Its central administration, the Holy See, is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> City, enclaved within Rome, Italy.|$|E
5|$|The Codex Vaticanus (The Vatican, Bibl. Vat., Vat. gr. 1209; no. B or 03 Gregory-Aland, δ 1 von Soden) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} extant manuscripts of the Greek Bible (Old and New Testament), one of the four great uncial codices. The Codex is named after its place of {{conservation}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> Library, where it has been kept since at least the 15th century. It is written on 759 leaves of vellum in uncial letters and has been dated palaeographically to the 4th century.|$|E
50|$|He was a {{participant}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> First <b>Vatican</b> Council and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Papal Conclave of 1846 that elected Pope Pius IX.|$|R
25|$|Soon afterwards, Pavelić visited Pope Pius XII in May 1941, {{attempting}} to win Vatican recognition, but failed (although the Papacy placed an ambassador <b>in</b> Zagreb). <b>The</b> <b>Vatican</b> maintained {{relations with the}} Yugoslav Government-in-exile.|$|R

5|$|The Enquiry into Plants (along {{with the}} Causes of Plants) was first {{translated}} into Latin by Theodore Gaza by 1454, circulated in manuscript, and then published at Treviso in 1483. In its original Greek it first appeared {{from the press}} of Aldus Manutius at Venice, 1495–98, from a single corrupt manuscript which has since been lost. Wimmer identified two manuscripts of first quality, the Codex Urbinas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> Library, which was not made known to Johann Gottlob Schneider, who with H. F. Link made the first modern critical edition, Leipzig 1818–1821, and the excerpts in the Codex Parisiensis in the Bibliothèque nationale de France.|$|E
5|$|The main {{primary source}} for Cragh's {{story is the}} record of the {{investigation}} into the canonisation of Thomas de Cantilupe, which is held <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> Library. Cragh's resurrection was one of thirty-eightmiracles presented to the papal commissioners who in 1307 were charged with examining the evidence for Cantilupe's saintliness. The hanged man himself gave evidence to the commission, after which nothing more is known of him. Cantilupe was formally canonised by Pope John XXII on 17 April 1320.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Ted was {{frequently}} uprooted as {{his family moved}} among Bronxville, New York, Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, Palm Beach, Florida, and the Court of St. James's in London, England. His formal education started at Gibbs School, in Sloane Street, Kensington, London. He attended ten different schools {{by the age of}} eleven, with his education suffering as a result. Ted was an altar boy at the St. Joseph's Church and received his First Communion from Pope Pius XII <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> at age seven. Ted spent sixth and seventh grades in the Fessenden School, where he was a mediocre student, and eighth grade at Cranwell Preparatory School; both schools were in Massachusetts. His parents were affectionate toward him as the youngest child, but also compared him unfavorably with his older brothers.|$|E

5|$|Between September 1997 and September 2006, Woon was {{seconded}} to the Foreign Service. He was Singapore's Ambassador to Germany from 6 February 1998 to July 2003, and was concurrently accredited to Greece from March 2000 to July 2003. He then {{served as}} Ambassador to Belgium (from 22 August 2003) with concurrent accreditation to the European Union, the Netherlands (from 22 October 2003), Luxembourg and the Holy See. In this capacity, he represented Singapore together with Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Law S. Jayakumar {{at the funeral}} mass of Pope John Paul II <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> City on 8 April 2005, {{believed to be the}} largest gathering of heads of state in history. In 2006, the Vatican made Woon a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, which is conferred on Roman Catholic men and women in recognition of their service to the Church, unusual labours, support of the Holy See, and the good example set in their communities and country.|$|E
5|$|From 1960, {{the regime}} {{increasingly}} implemented anti-Catholic policies, including harassment, atheistic propaganda, and measures that made carrying out religious practices more difficult. In 1965, the Conference of Polish Bishops issued the Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops. In 1966, the celebrations of the 1,000th {{anniversary of the}} Baptism of Poland led by the primate, Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński and other bishops, who toured the country, turned into a huge demonstration of the power and popularity of the Catholic Church in Poland. In fierce competition, the state authorities conducted their own national celebrations, stressing {{the origin of the}} Polish statehood, but the display of the Polish Church hierarchy's command of enormous crowds in a land ruled by the communists must have impressed the Catholic prelates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> and elsewhere. The state-church dialogue, symbolized by the presence of the few Znak independent Catholic deputies in parliament, was rapidly deteriorating.|$|E
5|$|From September 1513 to 1516, under Pope Leo X, Leonardo {{spent much}} of his time living in the Belvedere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vatican</b> in Rome, where Raphael and Michelangelo were both active at the time. In October 1515, King Francis I of France recaptured Milan. On 19 December, Leonardo was present at the meeting of Francis I and Pope Leo X, which took place in Bologna. Leonardo was {{commissioned}} to make for Francis a mechanical lion that could walk forward then open its chest to reveal a cluster of lilies. In 1516, he entered Francis' service, being given the use of the manor house Clos Lucé, now a public museum, near the king's residence at the royal Château d'Amboise. He spent the last three years of his life here, accompanied by his friend and apprentice, Count Francesco Melzi, and supported by a pension totalling 10,000scudi.|$|E
