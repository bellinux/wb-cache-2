OBJECTIVES: To evaluate {{the reliability of}} the integrated Shape <b>Imaging</b> <b>System</b> <b>scan</b> (Oxford Metrics Ltd, Oxford, UK) in detecting progression of scoliosis and the use of back shape data in predicting scoliosis progression. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: At first presentation and every 3 - 6 months during the follow-up period, all patients underwent integrated Shape <b>Imaging</b> <b>System</b> <b>scans</b> and radiographic examinations, from which the Cobb angle was measured. The follow-up period was 18 - 49 months (mean = 31. 4 months). METHODS: Patients were divided into three groups according to the severity and progression of the Cobb angle. The spinal fusion, brace, and observation groups were compared using analysis of variance and the student's t test to detect significant differences among groups in the progression of deformity as measured by the integrated Shape Imaging System parameters and the Cobb angle. RESULTS: Three of the Integrated Shape Imaging System parameters detected significant progression in the spinal fusion group 1 year earlier than the Cobb angle. Only one of the Integrated Shape Imaging System parameters detected a significant difference in progression between the brace and observation groups. CONCLUSIONS: The Integrated Shape Imaging System technique demonstrated significant changes in this group of patients with progressive scoliosis. Serial measurements of back surface shape, particularly the size of the rib hump, may be predictive of progression. Serial Integrated Shape <b>Imaging</b> <b>System</b> <b>scanning</b> has advantages over serial radiography in the management of idiopathic scoliosis in addition to the avoidance of exposure to ionizing radiation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{real-time}} <b>image</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>system</b> {{is designed}} using linescan camera. The system is especially designed to diagnose and analyse condition of tunnels such as crack widths using the captured images. The system {{consists of two}} major parts, the image acquisition system and image merging system. To save the scanned image data to storage media in real-time, the image acquisition system has been designed with two different control modules and management modules. The control modules {{are in charge of}} the hardware device control and the management modules handle system resources so that the scanned images are safely saved to the magnetic storage devices. The system can be mounted to various kinds of vehicles. After taking images, the image merging system is used for generating an extended image by combining saved images. Several tests were conducted in laboratory as well as in field environment. In the laboratory simulation, both systems are tested in several times and upgraded. In the field-testing, the image acquisition system is mounted to a specially designed vehicle and images of the interior surface of the tunnel is captured. The system is successfully tested in a real tunnel with a vehicle of speed 20 km/h. The captured images of the tunnel condition, including cracks, are as vivid as the view an expert could assess seeing through his/her eyes.

40|$|Fluorescence in situ {{hybridization}} (FISH) tests provide promising molecular imaging biomarkers to {{more accurately}} and reliably detect and diagnose cancers and genetic disorders. Since current manual FISH signal analysis is low-efficient and inconsistent, which limits its clinical utility, developing automated FISH image scanning systems and computer-aided detection (CAD) schemes has been attracting research interests. To acquire high-resolution FISH images in a multi-spectral scanning mode, {{a huge amount of}} image data with the stack of the multiple three-dimensional (3 -D) image slices is generated from a single specimen. Automated preprocessing these scanned images to eliminate the non-useful and redundant data is important to make the automated FISH tests acceptable in clinical applications. In this study, a dual-detector fluorescence <b>image</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>system</b> was applied to scan four specimen slides with FISH-probed chromosome X. A CAD scheme was developed to detect analyzable interphase cells and map the multiple imaging slices recorded FISH-probed signals into the 2 -D projection images. CAD scheme was then applied to each projection image to detect analyzable interphase cells using an adaptive multiple-threshold algorithm, identify FISH-probed signals using a top-hat transform, and compute the ratios between the normal and abnormal cells. To assess CAD performance, the FISH-probed signals were also independently visually detected by an observer. The Kappa coefficients for agreement between CAD and observer ranged from 0. 69 to 1. 0 in detecting/counting FISH signal spots in four testing samples. The study demonstrated the feasibility of automated FISH signal analysis that applying a CAD scheme to the automated generated 2 -D projection images...|$|E

40|$|Microwave and {{millimeter}} {{wave imaging}} has shown tremendous utility {{in a wide}} variety of applications. These techniques are primarily based on measuring coherent electric field distribution on the target being <b>imaged.</b> Mechanically <b>scanned</b> <b>systems</b> are the simple and low cost solution in microwave imaging. However, these systems are typically bulky and slow. This dissertation presents a design for a 2 D switched imaging array that utilizes modulated scattering techniques for spatial multiplexing of the signal. The system was designed to be compact, coherent, possessing high dynamic range, and capable of video frame rate imaging. Various aspects of the system design were optimized to achieve the design objectives. The 2 D imaging system as designed and described in this dissertation utilized PIN diode loaded resonant elliptical slot antennas as array elements. The slot antennas allow for incorporating the switching into the antennas thus reducing the cost and size of the array. Furthermore, these slots are integrated in a simple low loss waveguide network. Moreover, the sensitivity and dynamic range of this system is improved by utilizing a custom designed heterodyne receiver and matched filter. This dissertation also presents an analysis on the properties of this system. The performance of the multiplexing scheme, the noise floor and the dynamic range of the receivers are investigated. Furthermore, sources of errors such as mutual coupling and array response dispersion are also investigated. Finally, utilizing this imaging system for various applications such as 2 D electric field mapping, scatterer localization, and nondestructive imaging is demonstrated...|$|R

The designed procedures of the system {{are based on the}} integration of stereophotogrammetry and three-dimensional laser scanning techniques to capture high resolution stereo images and three-dimensional surface model of craniofacial morphology, respectively. The stereophotogrammetric technique introduced a new multi-camera system consisting of eight high resolution digital cameras, high speed shutter synchronisation controller and a specially built patients chair with photogrammetric control frame. The novel technique dubbed as natural features technique is developed and examined to improve the accuracy of craniofacial landmarks measurements via captured stereo <b>images.</b> The laser <b>scanning</b> <b>system</b> consists of two high resolution Minolta Vivid 910 laser scanners. The important factor of using the scanner for craniofacial mapping is completely tested. Finally, the registration accuracy of the point clouds datasets captured from the laser scanners is improved by using photogrammetric targets that setup on the photogrammetric control frame. Both imaging systems are calibrated independently using special built camera calibration test field (to calibrate the camera system) and calibrated test objects (to calibrate the laser <b>scanning</b> <b>system).</b> The results show that the developed novel technique achieves an accuracy of 0. 6 mm at one standard deviation. The registration of point clouds datasets by using photogrammetric targets achieves an accuracy of less than 0. 3 mm at one standard deviation. The results also show that the use of laser <b>scanning</b> <b>system</b> for craniofacial mapping depends on several significant factors such as scan distance, camera focal length, laser beam intensity, scanning resolution, convergence angle and the number of overlapping scans.
