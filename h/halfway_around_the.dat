5|$|Early on 20 January, the BOM {{upgraded}} the low to {{a tropical}} cyclone, {{at which time}} it was given the name Magda. However, there is uncertainty whether the system actually obtained this strength or if it strengthened hours later. At {{the time of the}} upgrade, Magda featured deep convection over its centre, but banding features extended a little more than <b>halfway</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> circulation. Later that day, the small cyclone underwent a period of rapid intensification as an eye feature became apparent in satellite imagery. In response to an approaching trough, Magda tracked towards the southeast. Around 2100UTC, the JTWC issued their first advisory on Magda, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 08S. Over the following several hours, the eye feature became increasingly defined, allowing the storm to intensify into a severe tropical cyclone by 0000UTC on 21 January. Upon reaching this strength, Magda attained ten-minute sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph) and a barometric pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.88inHg). However, shear abruptly increased hours later, causing the low-level circulation of Magda to become displaced from the deepest convection.|$|E
5|$|Early on 26November, {{the former}} cyclone emerged over the Gulf of Carpentaria near Blue Mud Bay. Once offshore, {{a break in}} the upper-level ridge {{previously}} steering the storm eastward caused a southward shift in the track, bringing it directly over Groote Eylandt for several hours. Gale-force winds soon redeveloped over the southeastern quadrant of Alessia; however, it was not re-designated as a tropical cyclone until 27November when the winds extended <b>halfway</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> circulation. As Alessia re-intensified over the southwestern Gulf, its movement became more southeasterly, taking the circulation parallel to the coast. With an anticyclone over the Northern Territory providing modest outflow for the cyclone, it continued to intensify; the JTWC also re-initiated advisories on the storm by 0600UTC on 27November. Hours later, Alessia reached its peak strength with winds of 85km/h (50mph) and a barometric pressure estimated at 991mbar (hPa; 29.27inHg). Simultaneously, it moved ashore near Wollogorang, roughly 130km (80mi) east of Borroloola. Increasing shear and land interaction caused the low- and mid-level circulations to separate, with the later continuing eastward over water. The storm soon weakened to a tropical low and its movement became erratic. Its remnants persisted for several days in the same general region, executing a clockwise loop before moving back over the Gulf of Carpentaria on 28November. While environmental conditions favored redevelopment once again and deep convection had formed over the system, its low-level circulation remained poorly organized. Failing to regenerate, Alessia moved eastward before doubling back to the west, passing near the Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands on 30November. It was last noted on 1December over the Top End region.|$|E

25|$|Real amplitudes differ considerably, {{not only}} because of depth {{variations}} and continental obstacles, but also because wave propagation across the ocean has a natural period of the same order of magnitude as the rotation period: if there were no land masses, it would take about 30 hours for a long wavelength surface wave to propagate along the equator <b>halfway</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Earth (by comparison, the Earth's lithosphere has a natural period of about 57 minutes). Earth tides, which raise and lower the bottom of the ocean, and the tide's own gravitational self attraction are both significant and further complicate the ocean's response to tidal forces.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the Russians were {{preparing}} to reinforce their Far East Fleet by sending the Baltic Fleet, {{under the command of}} Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky.

The fleet was forced to take this longer route after the Dogger Bank incident on 21 October 1904, where the Russian fleet fired on British fishing boats that they mistook for enemy torpedo boats. This caused the British to deny them access to the Suez Canal, thus forcing them around Africa, and nearly sparking a war with the United Kingdom (an ally of Japan, but neutral, unless provoked).|$|E

500|$|Following the sprinter-friendly {{stages of}} the {{previous}} two days, the third stage was more undulating and included three categorised climbs during its [...] itinerary.

500|$|Following Anaximander, his pupil Anaximenes (c. 585–528/4) {{held that}} the stars, Sun, Moon, and planets are all made of fire.

And unlike Anaximander, he relegated the fixed stars to the region most distant from the Earth.

There was nothing feminine {{in the way she}} handled him; her method was imperative and masculine. Had this not been so, Daylight would have expected her to say she had had enough. But that little preliminary exhibition had taught him something of Dede's quality. And if it had not, a glance at her gray eyes, just perceptibly angry with herself, and at her firm-set mouth, would have told him the same thing. Daylight did not suggest anything, while he hung almost gleefully upon her actions in anticipation of what the fractious Bob was going to get. And Bob got it, on his next whirl, or attempt, rather, for he was no more than <b>halfway</b> <b>around</b> when <b>the</b> quirt met him smack on his tender nose.
