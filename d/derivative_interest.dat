5000|$|... "Bucket shop" [...] is {{a defined}} term under the {{criminal}} law of many states in the United States that make {{it a crime to}} operate a bucket shop. Typically {{the criminal law}} definition refers to an operation in which the customer is sold what {{is supposed to be a}} <b>derivative</b> <b>interest</b> in a security or commodity future, but there is no transaction made on any exchange. The transaction goes [...] "in the bucket" [...] and is never executed. Because no trading of actual securities occurs, the customer is essentially betting against the bucket shop operator in a game based on abstract security prices. While trading in a legitimate exchange also provides a similar game or wagering aspect, the one distinctive characteristic of a bucket shop is the mimicry of trading securities when no actual securities are traded. The bucket shop's exchange is a fiction, which the parties agree to imagine as following the events occurring in a real exchange. Alternatively, the bucket shop operator [...] "literally 'plays the bank,' as in a gambling house, against the customer." ...|$|E

As such the model is well suited for Monte Carlo simulation of <b>derivative</b> <b>interest</b> rate instru-ments.

In a case study we demonstrate that the extended Libor model allows for stable calibration to the cap-strike matrix. The calibration algorithm is FFT based, so fast and easy to implement...|$|E
40|$|This paper assesses {{proposals}} {{to redefine the}} scope of activities of systemically important financial institutions. Alongside reform of prudential regulation and oversight, these have been offered as solutions to the too-important-to-fail problem. It is argued that while the more radical of these proposals such as narrow utility banking do not adequately address key policy objectives, two concrete policy measures - the Volcker Rule in the United States and retail ring-fencing in the United Kingdom - are more promising while still entailing significant implementation challenges. A risk factor common to all the measures {{is the potential for}} activities identified as too risky for retail banks to migrate to the unregulated parts of the financial system. Since this could lead to accumulation of systemic risk if left unchecked, it appears unlikely that any structural engineering will lessen the policing burden on prudential authorities and on the banks.

Their stabilizing properties imply that, when bond prices fall, prices for puttable and extendible bonds fall by less. Their embedded options work as a cushion and replicate the trading gains from hedging long-term bonds with interest rate derivatives. These bonds can help develop interest-rate derivative markets in developing countries and eventually increase demand for long-term government bonds. Informal evidence from OECD countries suggests that these bonds were useful in the 1980 s, when interest rates were volatile.

The paper contributes to the debate on FCAC in two ways. First, it reviews the potential and existing financial stability challenges to FCAC in India. Second it studies how prudential regulation and supervision is addressing these challenges. The main conclusion is that regulatory and supervisory measures alone are not enough and will need to be complemented by improvements in Indian banks'' risk management and further development of the domestic capital markets.

40|$|Financial {{derivatives}} {{are products}} whose price is linked {{with that of}} an underlying asset. The relationship between these two prices has been studied in depth, and the following conclusions have been reached: (1) the volatility of underlying asset's price decreases after the introduction of derivatives, (2) the price discovery effect improves, (3) the liquidity of the underlying asset's market increases, (4) the bid-ask spread decreases together, and (5) the noise component of prices decreases. Those results are microeconomic and are not coherent with a macroeconomic analysis of derivatives. Derivatives tend to change the effectiveness of monetary policy actions by modifying the instruments that can be used. Derivatives have a monetary nature {{that has not been}} yet recognized by central banks and international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements. This monetary nature can be evident by testing the relationship between <b>derivatives</b> and the <b>interest</b> rate. The consciousness of the monetary nature of derivatives would impose the quantification of transactions at least by the institutions that hold them, such as banks and other financial operators, and consequently by national authorities.

We conclude that derivatives have {{to be included in the}} definition of money, and support our conclusions with an econometric test on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Chicago Board of Trade indexes. We focus on the direct relationship between derivatives' supply and the interest rate, the analytical basis of speculative money demand introduced by Keynes and the foundation of the Fratianni-Savona model to single out the international monetary base. Consequently, monetary aggregates measured by international institutions, such as the Bank for International Settlements, underestimate the actual offshore market size.

The estimation procedure uses a modified seemingly unrelated simultaneous method that recognizes cross-equation dependencies and adjusts for serial correlation and heteroskedasticity. Overall, the exchange rate risk betas are more significant than the interest rate risk betas. More importantly, we find a link between the scale of a bank's interest rate and currency derivative contracts and the bank's interest rate and exchange rate risks. Particularly noteworthy is the influence of currency derivatives on exchange rate betas.

Lynne Sagalyn, 2007 The success of infill development often depends on the ability to assemble land. Dense development requires large parcels of buildable land, yet in the places where redevelopment is needed most, such as declining neighborhoods in central cities, large parcels of land are often hard to find. So redevelopment pivots on land assembly, but land assembly is no easy task. The many small parcels of land with different owners create problems of cooperation and coordination. A developer might attempt to buy enough parcels to create a suitable site, but if some owners hold out from a land assembly hoping to be last to sell (and therefore able to command a higher price), the land remains fragmented and the redevelopment is stymied.
