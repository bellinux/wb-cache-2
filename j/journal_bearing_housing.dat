Fatigue owing to some factors, which is Stress concentration on fatigue, Stress life, Effect size and surface, and Change properties of surface. The fatigue {{failure of a}} material {{is dependent on the}} interaction of a large stress with a critical flow. In essence, fatigue is controlled by the weakest link of the material, with the probability of a weak link increasing with material volume. This phenomenon is evident in the fatigue test results of a material using specimens of varying diameters. From this research we can get effect of concentration stress on strength fatigue with S-N method. On this method only count fatigue life or endurance limit from <b>Journal</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>housing.</b> By Finite Element Analysis, it is not so easy to determine fatigue life.

A survey showed that existing criteria were {{based solely on the}} amplitude of vibration, normally of the bearing housings, with no allowance being made for the dynamic properties of the support 1 ng structure. The feasibility of measuring the mechanical impedance of bearing supports in order to assess the severity of vibration generated by a machine has been investigated.

40|$|Lecturepg. 1 - 10 Improved {{turbomachinery}} aerodynamic {{performance requirements}} have increased <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> operating speeds and loads well above traditionally acceptable values. For example, for high performance gearboxes, pinion bearing surface speed requirements are often over 325 f/s with bearing unit loading in the 500 psi range. In {{order to meet}} the design challenges for these severe applications, evaporated bearing housings have been utilized as an effective means of reduction <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> operating temperatures. Unfortunately, the use of evacuated housing designs has introduced a new and troubling phenomena - <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> starvation. This was never a problem with flooded designs with pressurized housings since any additional oil that may be required is simply drawn from the captured oil inside of the <b>bearing</b> <b>housing.</b> With the new evacuated housing designs, all required oil must be supplied by the oil inlet orifices. Often times, the amount of supply oil required to keep all pads from starving is well beyond reasonable. Thus, due to practicality, starvation in some form is allowed in almost all evacuated designs. This paper discusses evacuated <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> starvation and its possible detrimental effects on rotordynamics. Specifically, the effect of starvation on <b>journal</b> <b>bearing</b> stiffness and damping is investigated. A case history is presented showing the effect of increasing oil flow on the location and amplification of a gearbox pinion critical speed during new zero load mechanical testing. As flow increased and the bearing became less starved, the location of the critical increased while the amplification decreased indicating a strong dependency of bearing stiffness and damping on oil flow. Concurrently, a similar but smaller bearing was tested under zero load starvation conditions. Essentially no effect on stiffness and damping was evident. From these results, the authors conclude that although increasing the oil flow solved the problem, starvation in itself was not the cause...|$|R

Neves et al. [11] conducted theoretical investigation of the discharge coefficient influence on the stiffness performance of aerostatic <b>journal</b> <b>bearings.</b> Du et al. [12] researched the effects of pressure equalizing groove on the load capacity and stiffness of externally pressurized gas <b>journal</b> <b>bearings.</b>|$|R
