40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a hedging back-study which {{assesses the}} effectiveness of interest- rate modelling and the hedging of interest-rate derivatives. Caps that trade in the Johannesburg swap market are hedged using two short-rate models, namely the Hull and White (1990) one-factor model and the subsequent Hull and White (1994) two-factor extension. This is achieved by using the equivalent Gaussian additive-factor models (G 1 ++ and G 2 ++) outlined by Brigo and Mercurio (2007). The hedges are constructed using different combinations of theoretical zero-coupon bonds. A flexible factor hedging method is proposed by the author and the bucket hedging technique detailed by Driessen, Klaasen and Melenberg (2003) is tested. The results obtained support the claims made by Gupta and Subrahmanyam (2005), Fan, Gupta and Ritchken (2007) {{and others in the}} literature that multi-factor models outperform one-factor models in hedging interest-rate derivatives. It is also shown that the choice of <b>hedge</b> <b>instruments</b> can significantly influence hedge performance. Notably, a larger set of <b>hedge</b> <b>instruments</b> and the use of <b>hedge</b> <b>instruments</b> with the same maturity as the derivative improve hedging accuracy. However, no evidence to support the finding of Driessen et al. (2003) that a larger set of <b>hedge</b> <b>instruments</b> can remove the need for a multi-factor model is found...|$|R
50|$|From a <b>hedging</b> <b>instrument,</b> {{dividend}} futures {{have the}} potential of developing as an asset class on their own. From an investor perspective, dividend futures give exposure to a specific cash flow stream from a company. Unlike equities, where an investor is exposed to continuing dividend stream, dividend futures allow investors to choose the year {{they want to get}} exposed on.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, cross-currency swaps are an {{integral}} component in modern financial markets as they are the bridge needed for assessment of yields on a standardised USD basis. For this reason there are also used as the construction tool in creating collateralized discount curves for valuing a future cashflow in a given currency but collateralized with another currency. Given the importance of collateral to the financial system at large, cross-currency swaps are important as a <b>hedging</b> <b>instrument</b> to insure against material collateral mismatches and devaluation.|$|E
50|$|To be {{designated}} and qualify for FAS 133 hedge accounting, a commodity (hedged item) and its <b>hedging</b> <b>instrument</b> {{must have a}} correlation ratio between 80% and 125%, and the reporting enterprise must have hedge documentation {{in place at the}} inception of the hedge. If these criteria are not met, hedge accounting cannot be applied. The non-applicability of hedge accounting can lead to significant volatility in corporate earnings. Now, the financial community has had enough experience with FAS 133 that companies and constituents better understand this process and are less critical of the volatile impact on earnings.|$|E

We also investigate whether a fully rational agent can employ additional <b>hedging</b> <b>instruments</b> to stabilize markets. It turns out that the answer depends on the composition of the population of non-rational traders and the information gathering costs for rationality. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to evaluate the}} various alternatives available to the Indian corporates for hedging financial risks. By studying the use of <b>hedging</b> <b>instruments</b> by major Indian firms from different sectors, the paper concludes that forwards and options are preferred as short term <b>hedging</b> <b>instruments</b> while swaps are preferred as long term <b>hedging</b> <b>instruments.</b> The high usage of forward contracts by Indian firms as compared to firms in other markets underscores the need for rupee futures in India. In addition, the paper also looks at the necessity of managing foreign currency risks, and looks at ways by which it is accomplished. A review of available literature results {{in the development of}} a framework for the risk management process design, and a compilation of the determinants of hedging decisions of firms. The paper concludes by pointing out that the onus is on Reserve Bank of India, the apex bank of the country, and its Working Group on Rupee Futures to realise the need for rupee futures in India and the convertibility of the rupee...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} <b>instruments</b> of <b>hedging</b> {{and risk}} management applied in both conventional and Islamic banking market places.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the potential of}} pre- and post-disaster instruments for funding disaster response and recovery and for creating incentives for flood loss mitigation in countries with emerging economies. As a concrete case, we discuss the disaster recovery arrangements following the 1997 flood disaster in Poland. We examine the advantages and limitations of <b>hedging</b> <b>instruments,</b> which are instruments for transferring the risk to investors either through insurance or capital market-based securities. We compare these mechanisms with financing instruments whereby the government sets aside funds prior to a disaster or taps its own funding sources after the event occurs. We show how <b>hedging</b> <b>instruments</b> can be designed to create incentives for the mitigation of damage to public infrastructure using the flood proofing of a water treatment plant on the River Oder in Poland as an illustrative example. We conclude that <b>hedging</b> <b>instruments</b> can be an attractive alternative to the financing instruments that have been traditionally used in developing countries to fund disaster recovery. Since very poor countries {{are likely to have}} difficulties in paying the price of protection prior to a disaster, we suggest that international lending institutions consider innovations for subsidizing these payments...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} why gold mining firms use options {{instead of}} linear strategies to hedge their gold price risk.

40|$|Hedgingfixed rate {{mortgage}} (FRM) portfolios {{with financial}} futures and options is suggested to substitutes for the adjustable rate mortgage as the <b>hedging</b> <b>instrument.</b> This study examines the comparative benefits of hedging the FRM through selling futures, buying puts, and the combined buy-putlsell-call strategies in lowering {{the standard deviation}} of returns of the unhedged portfolio over the period 1983 to 1991. The results show that covering the FRM through futures and options markets strategies are successful in lowering the variability of returns. The relative advantage of each strategy {{in terms of the}} mean-standard deviation pairs, however, depends on the direction of interest rate movements.

40|$|My {{thesis is}} focused on a hedging bill. There are already {{detailed}} publications on this topic written by authorities in this area. That is why I tried to shift the content of my thesis to comparison of a hedging bill with other <b>hedging</b> <b>instruments.</b> In my opinion in this way this thesis can close one gap in current literature.

40|$|In recent years, {{managers}} {{have become increasingly}} aware of how their organizations can be affected by risks beyond their control.

Our results are as follows: although the risky revenues accrue only in the last period of the bank's planning horizon, the optimal hedging strategy involves futures commitments at all dates. By adapting -a sequential hedging strategy, the bank is able to hedge both the interest rate risk on the spot market at the time of fulfillment of the contracts and the risk of fluctuating forward rates at intermediate trading dates. We demonstrate that the multiperiod hedge exhibits a separation property if the set of futures markets is complete. ...|$|R
