30|$|The plant {{properties}} used {{in traditional}} medicine are also {{considered as a}} subject {{of the field of}} dentistry to be exploited for the purpose of <b>relieving</b> <b>tooth</b> pain, gum inflammation, and canker sores or aphthous [13]. But firstly, {{it is more important to}} understand the effects of plant extracts on the human body and its interactions with other medicines. As well-known many of these extracts have anti-inflammatory effects and prevent bleeding, which can be the basic resources in the dental treatment [14]. We note that there are other effects of these plants such as antiseptics, antibacterial, antimicrobial, antifungal, antioxidant, antiviral, and analgesic agents [15].|$|R
40|$|The use of {{prescription}} opioids has increased dramatically in Canada in recent decades. This rise in opioid prescriptions {{has been accompanied by}} increasing rates of opioid-related abuse and addiction, creating serious public health challenges in British Columbia (BC), one of Canada's most populated provinces. Our study explores the relationship between dental pain and prescription opioid use among residents in BC. We used data from the 2003 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), which asked respondents about their use of specific analgesic medications, including opioids, and their history of tooth pain in the past month. We used logistic regression, controlling for potential confounding variables, to identify the predictive value of socioeconomic factors, oral health-related variables, and dental care utilization indicators. The Relative Index of Inequality (RII) was calculated to assess the magnitude of socioeconomic inequalities in the use of particular analgesics by incorporating income-derived ridit values into a binary logistic regression model. Our results showed that conventional non-opioid based analgesics (such as aspirin or Tylenol) and opioids {{were more likely to be}} used by those who had experienced a toothache in the past month than those who did not report experiencing a toothache. The use of non-opioid painkillers to <b>relieve</b> <b>tooth</b> pain was associated with more recent and more frequent dental visits, better self-reported oral health, and a greater income. Conversely, a lower household income was associated with a preference for opioid use to <b>relieve</b> <b>tooth</b> pain. The RII for recent opioid use and conventional painkiller use were 2. 06 (95 % CI: 1. 75 - 2. 37) and 0. 62 (95 % CI: 0. 35 - 0. 91), respectively, among those who experienced recent tooth pain, suggesting that adverse socioeconomic conditions may influence the need for opioid analgesics to relieve dental pain. We conclude that programs and policies targeted at improving the dental health of the poor may help to reduce the use {{of prescription}} opioids, thereby narrowing health inequalities within the broader society...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{of prehistoric}} {{dentistry}} {{has been limited}} to a few cases, the most ancient {{dating back to the}} Neolithic.

The use of different analytical techniques, including synchrotron radiation computed micro-tomography (micro-CT), Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating, Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), has shown that the exposed area of dentine resulting from occlusal wear and the upper part of a vertical crack affecting enamel and dentin tissues were filled with beeswax shortly before or after the individual’s death. If the filling was done when the person was still alive, the intervention was likely aimed to <b>relieve</b> <b>tooth</b> sensitivity derived from either exposed dentine and/or the pain resulting from chewing on a cracked tooth: this would provide the earliest known direc...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{ascertain}} whether steroid therapy evokes dentin hypersensitivity (DH) -like tooth pain, {{we performed a}} study based on compelling evidence from patients receiving steroid therapy. An exploratory study was conducted using a questionnaire for 220 patients prescribed steroids who attended the Department of Hematology and Rheumatology of Tohoku University Hospital. Group comparisons between patients with and without steroid pulse therapy were analysed by statistical means. In this study, any DH-like tooth pain that commenced subsequent to steroid treatment was defined as steroid-derived (SD) tooth pain. The prevalence of SD tooth pain was 17. 7 % (39 / 220 patients). SD tooth pain was triggered in many vital teeth by cold and/or hot water (84. 2 % and 23. 7 %, respectively) with the pain characterised as continuous, in contrast to typical DH tooth pain. SD tooth pain was significantly more frequent in pulse therapy patients than in non-pulse therapy patients (p <  0. 05). Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and sex showed similar results (odds ratio =  3. 74, p =  0. 013). Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between the steroid dose and pain score (ρ =  0. 642). Dose reduction or discontinuation of steroid therapy <b>relieved</b> SD <b>tooth</b> pain in all cases. Thus, steroid therapy can evoke DH-like tooth pain during treatment...|$|R
5000|$|A literal {{flat spot}} can occur on car tires if {{the vehicle is}} parked without moving for some time (generally longer than a week), and the tire {{deformation}} {{at the bottom of}} the wheel becomes semi-permanent. The <b>flat</b> spot gradually <b>relieves</b> itself when the car is driven but can temporarily give similar symptoms to an unbalanced wheel. Cars being laid up for extended periods, or intermittently-used caravans and trailers, should be kept on axle stands (tyres not in contact with the ground) or have the tires over-inflated to eliminate or reduce this problem. [...] "Tire savers", curved wheel stands, are also available for use during storage. These reduce or avoid the problem by cradling the lower part of the tire tread and preventing the usual deformation where it rests on the ground.|$|R
40|$|Objective : To {{compare the}} {{analgesic}} efficacy {{and safety of}} single-dose oral ketorolac and tramadol administered pre and postoperatively for dental extraction pain. Materials and Methods: 74 patients undergoing third molar extraction (impacted or other causes) were recruited into the study, {{over a period of}} 1 year. The patients were divided into six groups and they were given ketorolac (20 mg), tramadol (100 mg), or placebo either preoperatively or postoperatively (half an hour before or half an hour after the procedure). Placebo was glucose powder filled in empty capsule. Pain assessment was done using a modified Verbal Rating Scale (VRS) at 30 min, 2, 4, and 6 h after the procedure. A record of whether rescue analgesic (ibuprofen 400 mg) was taken during the 6 h study period, along with the time it was taken, was made. Record of any adverse effects experienced by the patient was also kept. Maximum pain scores for each of the six study groups, over the 6 h study period, were noted. Results: Ketorolac and tramadol were significantly better than placebo in <b>relieving</b> molar <b>tooth</b> extraction pain. Postoperative administration of tramadol was found to be more efficacious than preoperative administration in relieving the pain, whereas the preoperative administration of ketorolac was better than its postoperative administration. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that tramadol is equally effective to ketorolac in relieving pain in the first 6 h after molar extraction and therefore can be tried in patients who are intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{observe and}} assess the {{efficacy}} and safety of conjunctival papilla grinding technique {{in the treatment of}} severe vernal keratoconjunctivitis(VKC) with giant conjunctival papilla. METHODS: The prospective and controlled study was performed in 17 patients(24 eyes) with VKC. Eight patients(12 eyes) with giant conjunctival papillae were treated with grinding technique and 9 patients(12 eyes) were performed with conjunctival papillectomy, respectively. A comparison was made on the changes of symptoms including itching, tearing, light sensitivity and grittiness and physical signs of conjunctival papilla and the corneal epithelium before and after surgery. RESULTS:The symptoms and signs in the first week, the second week and the forth week after the operation were obviously improved in the two groups, and differences in these aspects before and after surgery were of statistical significance(P 0. 01). However, by grading of the signs of huge conjunctival nipple in the first week, the second week and the forth week after the operation, and conditions of repair of corneal damage in the second postoperative week, the result showed that efficacy of the grinding group was better than that of the surgical removal group(P CONCLUSION:Conjunctival nipples grinding operation can make the rough conjunctival wound <b>flat</b> quickly, <b>relieve</b> symptoms, and promote the repair of keratoconjunctival epithelium.

40|$|Normal {{anisotropy}} {{is crucial}} for deep drawability of sheet metal. Texture of the sheet determines the normal anisotropy. It is often observed that the forming conditions remaining unchanged, sheets having similar tensile properties do not always show similar drawability in press working. It was therefore thought that strain and strain path dependent change in the normal anisotropy of two sheets could {{hold the key to}} this behaviour. Hence studies were undertaken to ascertain as to whether such a strain path dependent change in the anisotropy does occur. While in the literature, strain dependent change in anisotropy has been investigated, dependence on the strain path has not been reported. Studies on the strain dependent variation in texture of non-ferrous materials (Al alloys and brass in particular) have been widely, reported. Literature on the strain and strain path dependence of texture and the anisotropy of steel sheet is not easily available. An experimental program was therefore undertaken to stretch the sheet in-plane to different strain levels for each of the five strain paths considered. Two strain paths characterised the negative minor strain and two characterised biaxial tension. The fifth one was close to plane strain. Special tooling with a 200 nun diameter <b>flat</b> (but <b>relieved)</b> bottom punch was fabricated. Specimens for R-value, texture and Modul-(r) over bar measurements were all cut from the flat, in-plane stretched (punch bottom) region of the sheet. Results indicated significant dependence of the R-value and texture on the strain and strain path. The R-values were found to decrease with increasing strain in all the three methods of testing. The rate of decrease was found to be strain path dependent. The inferences from the mechanical measurements of R-value based on the ASTM procedure and those predicted from texture measurements were in excellent agreement. Thus texture studies throw light on macroscopic mechanical behaviour (strain and strain path dependent variation in anisotropy). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Historically, NSAIDs, {{used for}} more than 25 years to treat rheumatologic diseases, were then {{introduced}} to <b>relieve</b> pain after <b>tooth</b> extraction, and finally about 10 years ago for postoperative analgesia. NSAIDs have been increasingly used {{over the past ten}} years in the treatment of postoperative pain, such that they now play an important role in the management of postoperative analgesia, either alone or combined with opioids. When used alone, they are effective in relieving minor or moderate pain such as that seen after maxillofacial, minor orthopedic, or some ambulatory surgical procedures, and postpartum pain (episiotomy). In these indications, the main benefit as compared with opioids is the lack of respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting. Since these side effects delay discharge from the hospital after ambulatory surgery, the use of NSAIDs may result in faster recovery and earlier discharge. Because of the ceiling effect of NSAIDs, their efficacy as sole agents is usually insufficient to treat pain after major surgery (orthopedic, abdominal, thoracic). NSAIDs should then be combined with opioids. As part of a balanced analgesia regimen, NSAIDs will allow for opioid-sparing, and might subsequently reduce opioid-mediated side effects. A 20 to 50 % reduction in opioid consumption, sometimes with improved quality of analgesia, has been reported using different NSAIDs following various types of surgery. Better respiratory function, improved sleep quality, and faster recovery of gastrointestinal function have been reported with NSAIDs. However, the use of NSAIDs has not been shown to be associated with improved outcome or more rapid recovery. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Introduction & Objective: It {{is clear}} that tooth {{extraction}} is painful. Different drugs with various functions {{have been used in}} order to relieve the pain after extraction. Ibuprofen is a non-narcotic analgesic and acetaminophen is considered {{as one of the most}} consumption anti-inflammatory drugs and is administrated to relieve moderate to severe pains. Our purpose is comparing the effects of acetaminophen, ibuprofen and combination of them to <b>relieve</b> the <b>teeth</b> pain due to extraction under local anesthesia. Materials & Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, we divided 105 children (6 - 11 years old) referred to pediatrics ward of dental faculty of Hamadan University into 3 groups of 35 after getting their parent's consents, taking, their history and weighing them. Group 1 : received acetaminophen syrup with dose of 15 mg/kg, group 2 : received ibuprofen syrup with dose of 5 mg/kg, and group 3 received acetaminophen syrup with dose of 7. 5 mg/kg and ibuprofen syrup with dose of 2. 5 mg/kg.. One hour before and 15 min after tooth extraction, severity of their pain was evaluated according to table(CHEOPS). Drug effects in every group was studied by c 2, t-test and Mann Whitney U test. Results: Age average of the children under survey in the group of acetaminophen syrup was 8. 62 ± 1. 81 years old and in the group of ibuprofen syrup was 8. 45 ± 1. 68 years old, and in the group of acetaminophen with ibuprofen was equal with 8. 71 ± 1. 27 years old. Sex combination of the under survey children in the group of acetaminophen syrup was 51. 4 % / 48. 6 % (female/male), in the group of ibuprofen syrup was 51. 4 %/ 48. 6 %, and in the group of acetaminophen syrup with ibuprofen syrup was 65. 7 %/ 34. 3 %. Grade average of toothache immediately after extraction in the group treated with acetaminophen syrup was 33. 19 and, in group treated with ibuprofen syrup equaled 37. 81, and in the group treated with acetaminophen syrup with ibuprofen syrup was 47. 86. Grade average of toothache 15 min after extraction in the group 1 was 35. 1, in the second group was 35. 9, and in the third group was 40. 83. Conclusion: The group received ibuprofen syrup and in the group received acetaminophen syrup in comparison with the group received acetaminophen with ibuprofen on the instant and 15 min after extraction showed much more relieved effect (P< 0. 05). No meaningful statistic differences were observed between the group received acetaminophen I 5 mg/kg and the group received ibuprofen 5 mg/kg. (Sci J Hamadan Univ Med Sci 2012; 18 (4) : 5 - 9...|$|R
50|$|The {{fountain}} {{was described}} in the Illustrated London News of 25 August 1866 as a structure of gothic character, highly decorated and of octagonal form. It rises in four stages to a height of 40 ft, the diameter at the base being 12 ft. Four basins of polished Aberdeen granite occupy four sides of the lower stage, the other four compartments being filled in with suitable inscriptions. Immediately above the basins on two sides are placed medallion portraits of the late Mr. John Walter, in white marble, considerably recessed, under traceried canopies. The first stage {{is surrounded by a}} trefoil pierced parapet. The eight compartments are finished with gablets having carved finials at the apex. The <b>flat</b> surface is <b>relieved</b> with diapered work. At the eight angles are buttresses, relieved with various pinnacles. These are carried up throughout three stages, and add much to the effect of the general outline. The second stage consists of a series of pointed arches under gablets, filled in with tracery, the lower portion containing shields bearing the town arms. The shafts in this stage are proposed to be of red Mansfield stone, having carved caps. The third stage, of diminished diameter, rises from the second stage, being connected therewith by a vertical stepping. This stage has the buttresses again diminished, and finished with pinnacles having carved terminals. From this stage the lines are brought up to a point, the apex being surmounted with an ornamental cross. A flight of octagonal steps leads up to the fountain.In September 1950, some masonry toppled into the roadway, and the Works and Ways Department of the Corporation barricaded the fountain off from the public. It was demolished a few days later.|$|R
