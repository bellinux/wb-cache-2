Asked her stance on the arrest of feminist punk-rock band Pussy Riot, Madonna responded: [...] "I'm against censorship, and my whole career I've always {{promoted}} freedom of expression and freedom of speech so I think what's happening to them is unfair. And <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> don't have to serve 7 years in jail; {{that would be a}} tragedy. I think art should be political, that art, historically speaking, always reflects what's going on socially. So for me it's hard to separate being an artist and being political." [...] During her Moscow show, Madonna gave a speech in support of the band, saying [...] "...My dream, and my prayer, is that everyone in the world has the right to express their opinions and still be treated as human beings. I know there are many sides to every story, and I mean no disrespect to the Church, or the government, but I think that these three girls -- Nadezhda, Yekaterina, and Maria -- have done something courageous. I think that they have paid the price for this act. And I pray for their freedom." [...] Madonna later appeared on stage with a temporary tattoo that said [...] "Pussy Riot" [...] on her back in place of the usual [...] "No Fear" [...] slogan, and performed [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] donning a balaclava covering her face, the band's trademark. It was considered an artistic statement against the oppression of the band's freedom of speech.|$|E

I think that they have paid the price for this act. And I pray for their freedom." [...] The response was largely positive. Many media outlets lauded Madonna's efforts, and other artists joined her in support of the band, among them Yoko Ono, Paul McCartney and Peter Gabriel. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, however, wrote an expletive-ridden Twitter post lambasting Madonna for backing the band: [...] "With age, every ex-slut tends to lecture everybody on morality. Especially during world tours and concerts." [...] Madonna's second Russian date in Saint Petersburg was consequently met with terrorist threats, prompting the U.S. Embassy to issue a warning to those in attendance. Madonna's spokesperson Liz Rosenberg responded that the concert would go on as scheduled and that Russian authorities would step up security for the date. Following threats of arrest by Russian officials if she spoke in support of gay rights and opposed the recent anti-gay law which prohibits [...] "public actions aimed at propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, bisexuality, and transgenderism among minors", Madonna responded, on March 21, in a letter on her website saying she was a [...] "freedom fighter" [...] and would defend LGBT rights. Before the show, Madonna released pink wristbands to audience members in support of the LGBT community. In addition, hundreds brought rainbow flags to the show and waved them throughout.|$|E

6000|$|When {{they reached}} the skeleton's tent they found, to their surprise, that no {{exhibition}} was being given at that hour, and Ella said, with some concern: [...] "How queer {{it is that the}} doors are not open! <b>I</b> do <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not sick." ...|$|R

6000|$|Sir Peregrine {{turned away}} and walked twice {{the length of the}} library; then, {{returning}} to the spot where the other stood, {{he put his hand on}} his grandson's shoulder. [...] "Well, Peregrine, I will pay them," [...] he said. [...] "I have no doubt that you did so intend when you incurred them;--and that was perhaps natural. I will pay them; but for your own sake, and for your dear mother's sake, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not very heavy. Can you give me a list of all that you owe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{mind what}} he says, my dear. You and I {{know all about}} it. Now we can do very well without him, for a time. He can go and tell his uncle and cousins all about his adventures, which, I have no doubt, they are dying to hear; and you and I can sit here, and {{exchange}} confidences until my barber comes. I don't look much like an Englishman now, but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{will be able to}} get me something that will take this stain off my face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{soon after}} {{the last of the}} other captives was murdered, we moved away to Kistnagherry, which was a very {{difficult}} place to escape from; and besides, very soon after we got there, I heard of the war with our people, and <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would take the place. It was, as you may suppose, a terrible disappointment to me when they failed in their attack on it. Still, <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would finally thrash Tippoo, and that, somehow, I might get handed over to them. However, as you know, when peace was made, and Kistnagherry had to be given over, the governor got orders to evacuate it, without waiting for the English to come up to take possession.|$|R
6000|$|After all {{we did not}} {{get away}} much before noon, because first {{there was a great}} deal to be done. To begin with the loads had to be arranged. These {{consisted}} largely of ammunition, everything else being cut down to an irreducible minimum. To carry them we took two donkeys there were on the place, also half a dozen pack oxen, all of which animals were supposed to be [...] "salted"--that is, to have suffered and recovered from every kind of sickness, including the bite of the deadly tsetse fly. I suspected, it is true, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would not be proof against further attacks, still, <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would last for some time, as indeed proved to be the case.|$|R
60|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{would give}} the {{business}} up. But this was not so, for being brave fellows, after a pause of perhaps five minutes, once more they charged in a body, hoping to overwhelm us. Again we greeted them with bullets and knocked out several, whereon the rest threw a volley of their long spears at us. I {{was glad to see}} them do this although one of the Zulus got his death from it, while two more were wounded. I myself had a very narrow escape, for a spear passed between my neck and shoulder. Each of them carried but one of these weapons and I knew <b>that</b> if <b>they</b> used them up in throwing, only their big knives would remain to them with which to attack us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me, father, but I do {{not want}} to listen to your reasons and excuses." [...] Her eyes were quite dry now. [...] "That woman nursed my dying mother, and played a mother's part to me. She is, as you know, my only woman friend, and yet you throw her away like a {{worn-out}} shoe. No doubt you have your reasons, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are satisfactory to you, but I tell you, reasons or no reasons, you have acted {{in a way that is}} cowardly and cruel;" [...] and casting one indignant glance at him she left the room.|$|E
6000|$|... “I dunno, sir. If {{it was on}} {{the open}} sea and calm like this, I should say they might be two or three miles, but in this ’ere forest there ain’t no saying at all. I don’t reckon they would be above two miles anyhow, that is if the stream is as strong up there as it is here. They were making very slow way against it when they started. I reckon they have been gone about an hour, and they would not have got more than two miles away against this stream. Well, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will be content now and turn back again.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is never}} any saying"--the woman {{went on in}} reply to his question--"there is never any saying; {{it all depends on}} tide and wind. Sometimes they have to anchor and lose a tide, or maybe two. Sometimes they get a cargo {{directly}} they get into the Pool or at Rochester; sometimes they wait two or three days. They have been away four days now; they might have been here yesterday, but may not come till to-morrow. One thing is certain, whenever he do come he will want something to eat, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will bring it with them, for there is nothing here but bread and bacon." ...|$|E
60|$|This was {{a capital}} idea, and I began {{immediately}} to work upon it. I managed the story very deftly; {{at least that}} was my opinion. My two principal characters made their appearance in Sicily, and at first were so intermingled with scenery and incidents as not to be very prominent; then they came more to the front, and other characters introduced themselves upon occasion. As these personages appeared and reappeared, <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would gradually surround themselves with an interest which would steadily increase the desire to know more and more about them. Thus, as I went on, I said less and less about Sicily, and more and more about my characters, especially the young man and the young woman, the curious blending of whose lives I was endeavoring to depict.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> you'll find <b>that</b> <b>they</b> haven't overstepped the boundary," [...] said Bellew, [...] "because the McLeods {{look as if}} they'd be {{troublesome}} {{customers to}} deal with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, I'm {{not saying}} it mightn't be, miss. I was only saying don't count on it, so you won't be {{disappointed}} if it doesn't happen. It's quite likely that it will, only all I say is don't count on it. <b>I</b> only <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> won't knock all the style out of him before they're done with him. You know these school professionals, miss." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{can they}} be up to by {{themselves}} at this hour of the morning?" [...] he said to himself. [...] "Well, they are two nice young fellows anyway, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{are not going to}} get into mischief. Now I will just make up the fire, and then sit down for an hour's snooze in my arm-chair. The captain said he was to be called at six. I suppose they are going out still-hunting somewhere. Well, I wish them luck; for when the boys can get their whisky for next to nothing they don't care about coming here, and small blame to them, for I shouldn't myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the spirit}} of these sentiments, I now take my {{farewell}} of the paternal soil. With anxious eye do I behold the clouds of doubt and difficulty that are lowering over it, and earnestly do <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may all clear up into serene and settled sunshine. In bidding this last adieu, my heart is filled with fond, yet melancholy emotions; and still I linger, and still, like a child leaving the venerable abodes of his forefathers, I turn to breathe forth a filial benediction: Peace be within thy walls, O England! and plenteousness within thy palaces; for my brethren and my companions' sake I will now say, Peace be within thee! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{was late}} upon a wretched night,' said Lizzie, 'when his eyes first {{looked at me}} in my old river-side home, very {{different}} from this. His eyes may never look at me again. I would rather that they never did; <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> never may. But I {{would not have the}} light of them taken out of my life, for anything my life can give me. I have told you everything now, my dear. If it comes a little strange to me to have parted with it, I am not sorry. I had no thought of ever parting with a single word of it, a moment before you came in; but you came in, and my mind changed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} see the Hunters {{are going}} to bring over their carriage," [...] the Major said, two days later, as he looked through a letter. [...] "I am very glad of that, for I put it off till too late. I have been trying {{everywhere}} for the last two days to hire one, but they are all engaged, and have been so for weeks, I hear. I was wondering what I should do, for my buggy will only hold two. I was thinking of asking Mrs. Doolan if she could take one of the Miss Hunters, and should have tried to find a place for the other. But this settles it all comfortably. They are going to send on their own horses halfway the day before, and hire native ponies for the first half. They have a good large family vehicle; <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would bring it, but, of course, I could not trust to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|That {{he and his}} halfpence {{should come}} to weigh down Our {{subjects}} so loyal and true to the crown: But <b>I</b> <b>hope,</b> after all, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will be his own. [...] Which, &c.|$|R
6000|$|... "There may be {{reason in}} that thou utterest," [...] {{observed}} Content, sorrowfully. [...] "Still it is lawful to mourn even the necessity which conduceth {{to all this}} strife. <b>I</b> had <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> who direct the Councils of the Colony might have resorted to less violent means of persuasion, to lead the savage back to reason, than that which cometh from the armed hand. Of what nature is thy especial errand?" ...|$|R
