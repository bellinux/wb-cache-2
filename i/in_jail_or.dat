5|$|On January 3, 1894, Crispi {{declared}} a state of siege throughout Sicily. Army reservists were recalled and General Roberto Morra di Lavriano was dispatched with 40,000 troops. The old order was restored through the use of extreme force, including summary executions. The Fasci were outlawed, the army and the police killed scores of protesters, and wounded hundreds. Thousands of militants, including all the leaders, were put <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> <b>or</b> sent into internal exile. Some 1,000 persons were deported to the penal islands without trial. All working-class societies and cooperatives were dissolved and the freedom of the press, meeting and association were suspended. A solidarity revolt of anarchists and republicans in the Lunigiana was crushed as well. The government also seized the opportunity to 'revise' the electoral registers. In Catania 5,000 of the 9,000 electors were struck off.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the Beti {{at large}} detested French forced labour {{practices}} and taxes. Some people {{fled to the}} bush before the tax collector arrived; others circumvented taxes by counting wives as out-of-town visitors or waiting {{until the last minute}} to pay and thus reducing the collector's cut of the tax money. If the taxes were not collected to the satisfaction of the colonial administrators, Atangana himself was expected to make up some of the difference. To counter these minor rebellions, chiefs could punish their subjects with 15 days <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> <b>or</b> 100 franc fines without due process of law. This was meant to be reserved for only certain infractions, but Atangana and other chiefs interpreted it broadly to include all sorts of difficult behaviour. Atangana and his sub-chiefs were expected to discipline such difficult subjects. He exerted continual pressure on the sub-chiefs, who in turn placed constant pressure on the villagers to pay taxes and supply labourers.|$|E

25|$|Nearly all German bishops, {{clergy and}} laymen {{rejected}} {{the legality of}} the new laws, and were defiant facing the increasingly heavy penalties, trials and imprisonments.

500|$|China's Population and Family Planning Law prohibits {{infringement}} on people's personal {{rights and}} property for family planning purposes. [...] Moreover, a 2001 law prohibited abortions after the sixth month of pregnancy. Nevertheless, {{human rights groups}} and critics of the one-child policy say that these laws are inconsistently enforced, and the local officials in many areas still carry out forced sterilizations and/or coerced abortions, sometimes in the third trimester after the fetus has reached viability. In ten Chinese provinces, including Shaanxi, authorities are permitted to take [...] "remedial measures" [...] to ensure that birth quotas are not exceeded. In eight other provinces, authorities are required to terminate unauthorized pregnancies. Activists such as Chen Guangcheng have been jailed by the Chinese government for bringing to light evidence of forced abortions. In 2005, Chen filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of women forced into sterilization or abortions and subsequently spent seven years <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> <b>or</b> under house arrest before emigrating to the United States in 2012.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, {{the laws}} against pimping and {{communicating}} provisions {{were determined to}} be constitutional and were retained. As of 2013, {{the constitutionality of the}} law against brothels was still under review. Falle said that brothels should not be legalized, saying, [...] "I know firsthand and... from the disclosures of the many women that I've been able to counsel over the years that most violence happens behind closed doors." [...] Falle said that if brothels were legalized, the police would have less legal ability to find women and children victimized by human trafficking. Bedford said that legalizing brothels would make prostitution safer for women because it would allow prostitution to take place indoors. Falle responded that most prostitution has already moved indoors, as the internet has made most street solicitation unnecessary, and argues that the move indoors has not made the women safer. She said that when she was in prostitution, she was even a little safer outdoors because of the added visibility to the public. In discussion of the case, Falle said, [...] "I don't know anyone in the prostitution business who hasn‚Äôt ended up dead, <b>in</b> <b>jail,</b> <b>or</b> on drugs." [...] She intended to bring a pimp stick to the Supreme Court of Canada in June 2013 as a visual aid in explaining how pimps often abuse the women they prostitute.|$|E

The third trial took place in May 1998, with a federal appeal court temporarily freeing Lambert under the belief that she would win her case. Judge Lawrence F. Stengel oversaw the trial. Various witnesses were called to testify against Lambert, including the detective that had overseen the 1991 murder case as well as Lambert's accomplices Buck and Yunkin.

2500|$|The San Francisco unions {{relied heavily}} on the Iron Workers, {{one of the few}} strong unions {{remaining}} in Los Angeles. The unionization campaign began in the spring of 1910. On June 1, 1910, 1,500 Iron Workers struck iron manufacturers in the city to win a $0.50 an hour minimum wage ($11.89 in 2011 dollars) and overtime pay. The M raised $350,000 ($8.3 million in 2011 dollars) to break the strike. A superior court judge issued a series of injunctions which all but banned picketing. On July 15, the Los Angeles City Council unanimously enacted an ordinance banning picketing and [...] "speaking in public streets in a loud or unusual tone", with a penalty of 50 days <b>in</b> <b>jail</b> <b>or</b> a $100 fine or both.

2500|$|During his presidency, Di·ªám {{strongly}} {{focused on}} his central concern: internal security to protect his regime as well as maintain order and social change: staunch anti-subversion and anti-rebellion policies. After the B√¨nh Xuy√™n was defeated and the H√≤a H·∫£o, Cao ƒê√†i were subdued, Di·ªám concentrated on his most serious threat: the communists. Di·ªám's main measures for internal security were threats, punishment and intimidation. According to Gabriel Kolko about 12,000 suspected opponents of Di·ªám were killed between 1955 and 1957 {{and by the end}} of 1958 an estimated 40,000 political prisoners had been jailed.
