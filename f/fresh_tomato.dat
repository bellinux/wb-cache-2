40|$|Abstract: Tomato {{trade between}} the U. S. and Mexico has grown {{significantly}} during the past decade, with significant implications for markets in both countries. This work examines how terminal market prices for Mexican <b>fresh</b> <b>tomatoes</b> are being affected by price dynamics in distant, integrated markets by analyzing reaction patterns to various innovation shocks. We conclude that a high interdependence in the price formation process between Mexican markets and Los Angeles, as well as among Mexican markets, exists. 2 Growing, year round demand for {{fresh fruits and vegetables}} stimulated international trade over the last decade. In the case of <b>fresh</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> imports to the United States (U. S.) increased considerably during the 1990 ´s, especially from Mexico and Canada. Mexico was the leading supplier of those imports, representing 91. 0 percent of total imports of <b>fresh</b> <b>tomatoes</b> on average, while Canada accounted for only 4. 8 percent. Moreover, imports from Mexico have entered the U. S. every week in recent years in increasing volumes. Tomato growers located in the Sinaloa and Baja California Peninsula of Mexico supply the majority of <b>fresh</b> <b>tomatoes</b> exported to the U. S., but they also supply domesti...|$|R
40|$|Several studies {{emphasize}} that agriculture and food {{as a whole}} {{are responsible for the}} increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, as a central actor in the food supply chain, consumers play a very important role as their food behaviour can be highly polluting. However, few studies focus on the environmental impact of consumer behaviour or investigate which action has the greatest consequences. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyse consumer practices, from purchase to final waste. <b>Fresh</b> and processed <b>tomatoes</b> were chosen as examples of general fruit and vegetables, and their environmental impact measured. Four impact categories were adopted: acidification, eutrophication, global warming and human toxicity. Results regarding <b>fresh</b> <b>tomatoes</b> clearly indicate that purchasing has the highest environmental impact for all 4 categories of impacts. Such an impact is mainly due to transport from supermarket to household (generally by car). Also in the case of processed tomatoes purchasing is responsible for a great share of the impact, but cooking and end of life phases are also very important, namely for acidification and global warming the former, and human toxicity the latter. If we compare <b>fresh</b> <b>tomatoes</b> with processed tomatoes, the latter have a greater impact in all 4 categories. GHG emissions at consumer level are 0. 07 kg CO 2 eq for <b>fresh</b> <b>tomatoes</b> and 0. 18 kg CO 2 eq for processed tomatoes, while human toxicity levels are 25 times higher for the latter. However, if we take into consideration the fact that 6 kg of <b>fresh</b> <b>tomatoes</b> are needed for 1 kg of processed tomatoes, the results can be seen in a different light. In this case, the impact of <b>fresh</b> <b>tomatoes</b> (global warming potential) is 2. 3 times higher than that of processed tomatoes. Finally, if we calculate CO 2 emissions generated by making equal quantities of <b>tomato</b> sauce with <b>fresh</b> <b>tomatoes</b> or rather with tomato paste, results are equal...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a linear cobweb model is {{developed}} {{to study the}} phenomenon of commodity price fluctuations and then a buffer stock incorporated into the model to stabilize the price of <b>fresh</b> <b>tomatoes</b> in Ghana. The model performed on the assumptions that <b>fresh</b> <b>tomatoes</b> have no equal substitutes, {{and that there is}} no foreign competition and also no exogenous shocks needed to generate price fluctuations. The analysis detected that the slope of the demand function of price was smaller than the slope of the supply function of price curve implying that the price and quantity supplied of the <b>fresh</b> <b>tomatoes</b> would oscillate around a fixed price and quantity and also spiral outward. The “Keep Supply at Average” (KSA) buffer scheme achieved price and quantity stability in the short run. The mean price of the scheme was GH¢ 17. 31, very close to actual price mean of Gh¢ 13. 40 in the first 16 quarters. The standard deviation of the scheme price also dropped to 1. 2 from 9. 13 during price stabilization compared to 14. 60 of actual price mean. In the long run the scheme price went up to Gh¢ 18. 22, an increase of Gh¢ 0. 91 and it is clear that in long run buffer system will fail unless the average supply is reviewed regularly. The scheme price trend equation indicated that with the implementation of the buffer scheme, the average quarterly price of <b>fresh</b> <b>tomatoes</b> increased by only 0. 05. </p...|$|R
40|$|A supply-response {{model for}} Florida <b>fresh</b> <b>tomatoes</b> is {{specified}} {{to analyze the}} impacts of the U. S. Department of Commerce's suspension agreement which governs imports of <b>fresh</b> <b>tomatoes</b> from Mexico. The particular {{focus is on the}} impact of the "reference" price which causes Mexican imports in a given week to cease if import prices in the prior week fall to the reference price. Using weekly weather data, a growing degree day (GDD) variable is constructed which predicts week of first harvest and duration of harvest. The GDD variable is used to construct the appropriate, variable lag length for weekly acres planted in four Florida production regions. A composite switching-regime model is estimated in which the regime prior to the suspension agreement occurs at a known time. The other two regimes occur when Nogales f. o. b. price are "near" or not near the reference price. Preliminary results suggest weekly Florida shipments of <b>fresh</b> <b>tomatoes</b> are more own-price elastic when Nogales f. o. b. prices near the reference price.
