This can necessitate {{the development of new}} sources of supply that may conflict with local wildlife interests. The paper reviews the policy background to this problem in the UK. It then presents an appraisal of a project to artificially recharge an aquifer with river water during the winter period, and abstract the water in the summer to augment shortages during drought conditions. The research investigates the preference trade-offs of water company customers between <b>increasing</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> and potential environmental impacts on local wetland sites and river flows. A cost-benefit analysis of the project is presented. The study also reveals a disparity between the site-specific valuation and that generated using the Environment Agency's approved benefit transfer guidelines. ...|$|E
40|$|Consumers {{constantly}} {{make decisions}} on {{the goods and services}} they purchase, in most cases with incomplete information. Many products that are available in stores, in catalogues, or over the internet are not presented with a full list of attributes or technical specifications. Lack of information is most apparent in non-market goods such as utility service attributes. This paper examines information effects on consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for a number of electricity and water attributes using two contingent valuation surveys administered in the UK. The attributes considered include WTP for a carbon cleaner electricity fuel mixture as well as <b>increasing</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> The results indicate that the quantity and complexity of information can potentially lead individuals to ignore the information presented. The relevance of the attribute to the respondent is found to be a significant motivator in the processing of the information presented. The survey data also reveal a number of socio-economic, attitudinal and behavioural factors that affect WTP for the attributes considered. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} 'Security of {{electricity}} supplies in the EU' is to verify validity of the argument that three objective of EU energy policy which the European Council officially agreed upon in 2007 might be conflicting in their practical implementation. Those objectives involve: increasing the competitiveness of European economies {{and the availability of}} affordable energy, combating climate change and <b>increasing</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> In order to verify relevance of this hypothesis, security of supply is narrowed down to the case of electricity as a specific commodity. With regard to the other two goals, the paper identifies main challenges to security of electricity supplies. Subsequently, the analysis of policy and legislative measures adopted at the EU level which should tackle these challenges is performed and their adequacy evaluated. Inadequate network infrastructure investment and absence of coordinated grid development as well as coordinated system operation are perceived as main concerns. Last but not least, the thesis analyzes interpretations of identified deficiencies provided by four theoretical approaches to European integration - neofunctionalism, liberal intergovernmentalism, new institutionalism and multi-level governanc...|$|E

This theoretical treatment focuses on three relevant cases of energy markets. First, the residential space heating sector where hybrid regulation such as taxation and emissions trading together are possible. Second, the electricity market where transactions are organized {{in the form of}} multi-period auctions. Third, namely natural gas (input) and electricity (output) markets where there is combined imperfect competition in vertical related energy markets.   The development of free or low carbon technologies supported by energy policies, aiming at <b>increasing</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> is also explored whilst considering competition policies that reduce market power in energy markets thus improving market efficiency. Pollution Under Environmental Regulation in Energy Markets discusses the key issues of whether imperfect competition can lessen the ability of environmental policy to reduce pollution and/or to minimize the cost of meeting environmental targets.   Policymakers, analysts and researchers gain a thorough understanding of the performance of environmental policy from Pollution Under Environmental Regulation in Energy Markets leading to better design of simulation models of performance and costs of environmental regulation...|$|E

This work presents a methodology for predicting power peaks in mainland Spain’s system in the decade 2011 - 2020. Forecasts of total electricity demand of Spanish energy authorities set the boundary conditions. The accuracy of the results has successfully been compared with records of demand (2000 - 2010) and with various predictions published. Three patterns have been observed: 1) efficiency in the winter peak; 2) increasing trend in the summer peak; 3) increasing trend in the annual valley of demand. By 2020, 58. 1 GW and 53. 0 GW are expected, respectively, as winter and summer peaks in a business-as-usual scenario. If the observed tendencies continue, former values can go down to 55. 5 GW in winter and go up to 54. 7 GW in summer. The annual minimum valley of demand will raise 5. 5 GW, up to 23. 4 GW. These detailed predictions can be very useful to identify the types of power plants needed to have an optimum structure in the electricity industry...|$|E

Techno-economic and environmental aspects as well as customer experiences were investigated. Ten electric-heated houses were equipped with extra meters, enabling hourly load measurements for heating, hot water and total electricity use. Household heating and hot water systems were controlled by the utility using an existing remote reading system.

40|$|In {{the current}} context {{of demand for}} reliable, low cost and low {{environmental}} impact energy sources, many countries and companies are mostly focused on fuel cells (FC) in fields as transportation and stationary power generation and portable devices. Lately, FCs have begun to be applied in naval and aeronautical systems due to its high efficiency, low noise and environmental advantages. These applications could range from propulsion systems to auxiliary power units(APU). The main {{problems associated with the}} use of FCs in these areas are the current high cost due to the materials used, i. e. Nafion and Pt, the lack of durability testing in these specific conditions, security issues to flammability and high H 2 pressures and low availability as a fuel, or the toxicity of methanol used as a fuel, and specific parameters such as weight in aircraft applications and volume in marine applications. Currently it is working on each of these issues, and at this point the ethanol as direct fuel is considered crucial. The use of ethanol as fuel has the advantage of easy transportation, storage and refueling, and is nontoxic. Bioethanol is a promising energy source, produced from raw materials containing sugar or starch. These raw materials exists in all parts of the world and is renewable, which involves the use of local energy sources contributing to the diversification of energy supply, reducing import dependence, <b>increasing</b> <b>security</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> and generating new opportunities for agriculture.
