In addition, {{the introduction of the}} 'all-seater' ruling following the Taylor Report has meant that spectators no longer resort to climbing nearby buildings <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> the event as a seat is guaranteed with a purchased ticket.|$|E

25|$|Hanks is {{perceived}} to be amiable and congenial to his fans. In 2013, when he was starring in Nora Ephron's Lucky Guy on Broadway, he had crowds of 300 fans waiting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> him after every performance. This is the highest number of expectant fans post-show of any Broadway performance.|$|E

As he traveled by rail to Lincoln, he saw farmers and others standing by the tracks, hoping <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> the new Democratic nominee. He received many letters from supporters, expressing their faith in him in stark terms. One Indiana voter wrote, [...] "God has sent you amongst our people to save the poor from starvation, and we no [...] you will save us."

2500|$|While {{at school}} in London, White made one close friend, Ronald Waterall, an older boy who shared similar interests. White's biographer, David Marr, wrote that [...] "the two men would walk, arm-in-arm, to London shows; and stand around stage doors crumbing <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> their {{favourite}} stars, giving a practical demonstration of a chorus girl's high kick... with appropriate vocal accompaniment". When Waterall left school, White withdrew again. He asked his parents {{if he could}} leave school to become an actor. The parents compromised and allowed him to finish school early if he came home to Australia to try life on the land. His parents felt that he should work on the land rather than become a writer and hoped that {{his work as a}} jackaroo would temper his artistic ambitions.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1905, after {{returning}} to Washington from their diplomatic travels, Alice became engaged to Nicholas Longworth III, a Republican U.S. House of Representatives member from Cincinnati, Ohio, who ultimately would rise to become Speaker of the House. The two had travelled in the same social circles for several years, but their relationship solidified during the Imperial Cruise. A scion of a socially prominent Ohio family, Longworth was 14 years her senior and {{had a reputation as}} a Washington D.C. playboy. Their wedding took place in February 1906 and was the social event of the season. It was attended by more than a thousand guests with many thousands gathered outside hoping <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> the bride. She was dressed in a blue wedding dress and dramatically cut the wedding cake with a sword (borrowed from a military aide attending the reception). Immediately after the wedding, the couple left for a honeymoon that included a voyage to Cuba and a visit to the Longworths in Cincinnati. This was followed by travels to England and the Continent which included having dinners with many notables of the day: King Edward, Kaiser Wilhelm, Clemenceau, Whitelaw Reid, Lord Curzon, and William Jennings Bryan. [...] They bought a house at 2009 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., in Washington, D.C., now the headquarters of the Washington Legal Foundation.|$|E

60|$|As we {{drew near}} Genoa, the moon {{came out on}} purpose {{to show us the}} superb city, and we strove eagerly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> first <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> the proud capital where Columbus was born.

60|$|The thing swung in {{towards them}} with the whirl of the eddy, and Ingleby had <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> white patch in the water that was horribly suggestive of a face. Then he seized Hetty's hand, and drew her {{with him as he}} turned away.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded the album 2 stars stating [...] "The {{repertoire}} they perform is quite fresh {{but there is}} less excitement than one might hope and the musicians do not really form a unified group sound despite some strong individual moments".

40|$|Modern-day homes, {{offices and}} places of {{amusement}} {{are decorated with}} portraits of beautiful landscapes, flora and fauna.

60|$|He left James at {{the gate}} of the park, prowling about like a panther to try <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> Isabel's window, and feeding his despair and jealousy that Louis should boldly walk up to the door, while he, with so much better a right, was {{excluded}} by his unguarded promise to Lady Conway.|$|E

50|$|The {{film is a}} bildungsroman, {{treating}} universal {{issues of}} growing up in a rural landscape (see Pather Panchali <b>for</b> <b>a</b> famous movie of similar form). The movie shows little or no Kyrgyzstan-specific footage, except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> brief <b>glimpse</b> <b>of</b> money at one point. However, it depicts several Kyrgyz customs - including the ceremony of placing a baby in a cradle (biseke salu), the funerary ceremony and the engagement ceremony. The ceremonies depict several ethnic Kyrgyz artifacts, like the tekemet rugs of the region, the kigiz felt carpets and the Kyrgyz cradle or besik.|$|R

He rode steadily till the sun was overhead, when he stopped to let the pony rest and feed. He had a scanty lunch in his pocket, which he ate without water. Saddling up an hour or two later he continued his steady onward [...] "shack" [...] toward the West.|$|R
