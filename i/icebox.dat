25|$|John Famalaro: {{sentenced to}} death on September 6, 1997 for the kidnap, rape, and murder of 23-year-old Denise Anette Huber, from Newport Beach, California, in 1991. Famalaro {{abducted}} and murdered Denise on June 3, 1991. He was caught in July 1994 when police found her body in an <b>icebox</b> where he had kept her for 3 years.|$|E
25|$|In 1926, customs {{officials}} in the United States searching West Eldara for contraband made the unlikely discovery in the ship's <b>icebox</b> of an arctic owl. By 1928, the ship was sailing under {{the flag of the}} American Diamond Line (later known as the Black Diamond Line). In July of that year, West Eldaras Second Assistant Engineer was arrested in the United States in connection with the shooting death aboard ship of another crew member at Antwerp. The accused pleaded self-defence and was later cleared by a Grand Jury.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to other popular comedies {{of the era}} (such as Father Knows Best, Leave It to Beaver, and The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet), which depicted their characters in comfortable, middle class suburban environments, the set design for The Honeymooners reflected the blue collar existence of its characters. The Kramdens lived in a small, painfully sparsely furnished two-room apartment (the main set) in a tenement building at least four stories high (the Kramdens were {{on the third floor}} and the Nortons' were one floor above them), badly aired and with insufficient lighting. They used the single main room as the kitchen, dining and living room. It consisted of a functional table and chairs, a plain chest of drawers, a curtainless window with a view of a fire escape, a noisy sink, and an outdated <b>icebox.</b> The Kramdens' bedroom never was seen, although in the episode about Ed Norton's sleepwalking the Nortons' bedroom is. One of the few other sitcoms about a blue collar family was The Life of Riley, whose first season (1949–50) had featured Jackie Gleason in the lead role, although veteran movie actor William Bendix, who had originated the role of Chester A. Riley on the radio show, thereafter took over the role on television.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Iceboxes</b> {{date back}} to the days of ice harvesting, which had hit an {{industrial}} high that ran from the mid-19th century to the 1930s, when the refrigerator was introduced into the home. Most municipally consumed ice was harvested in winter from snow-packed areas or frozen lakes, stored in ice houses, and delivered domestically as <b>iceboxes</b> became more common. In 1907 survey of expenditures of New York City inhabitants, 81% of the families surveyed were found to possess [...] "refrigerators" [...] either in the form of ice stored in a tub or <b>iceboxes.</b> The widespread use of <b>iceboxes</b> was partially credited with reduction of US infant mortality in summer months.|$|R

Most municipally consumed ice was harvested in winter from snow-packed areas or frozen lakes, stored in ice houses, and delivered domestically as <b>iceboxes</b> became more common.|$|R
50|$|<b>Iceboxes</b> were {{commonly}} made of wood, {{most probably}} {{for ease of}} construction, insulation, and aesthetics; many were handsome pieces of furniture.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the early}} 1800s {{consumers}} preserved their food by storing food and ice purchased from ice harvesters in iceboxes. In 1803, Thomas Moore patented a metal-lined butter-storage tub {{which became the}} prototype for most iceboxes. [...] These iceboxes were used until nearly 1910 and the technology did not progress. [...] In fact, consumers that used the <b>icebox</b> in 1910 faced the same challenge of a moldy and stinky <b>icebox</b> that consumers had in the early 1800s.|$|E
2500|$|Devil's Den Self-Guided Trail is a National Recreation Trail. It is [...] long. It {{passes by}} two of the most popular attractions at the park: Devil's Den and the Devil's <b>Icebox.</b> It also {{features}} erosional remants of sandstone strata, wet weather waterfalls and a variety of plant and animal life.|$|E
2500|$|These {{findings}} are {{not supported by}} modern research. These studies, accompanied by the affordable price of evaporated milk {{and the availability of}} the home <b>icebox</b> initiated a tremendous rise in the use of evaporated milk formulas. [...] By the late 1930s, the use of evaporated milk formulas in the United States surpassed all commercial formulas, and by 1950 over half of all babies in the United States were reared on such formulas.|$|E
50|$|The lake {{for which}} the town is named was once an {{important}} part of the Twin Cities economy, as in the days before modern refrigerators, much of the ice for metropolitan <b>iceboxes</b> was harvested from Big Lake.|$|R
50|$|The {{profession}} {{was formerly}} {{much more common}} than it is today. From the late 19th century to mid-20th century, in cities and towns icemen would commonly make daily rounds delivering ice for <b>iceboxes</b> before the electric domestic refrigerator became commonplace.|$|R
5000|$|Frustrated by <b>iceboxes,</b> the Grand Rapids Refrigerator Company {{introduced}} a porcelain lined [...] "Leonard Cleanable" [...] ice cabinet. Kelvinator began buying Leonard's boxes for its electric refrigerated models. By 1923, the Kelvinator Company held 80 {{percent of the}} American market for electric refrigerators.|$|R
2500|$|Eventually Georges Méliès {{was made}} a Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur, the medal of which was {{presented}} to him in October 1931 by Louis Lumière. Lumière himself said that Méliès was the [...] "creator of the cinematic spectacle." [...] However, the enormous amount of praise that he was receiving did not help his livelihood or decrease his poverty. In a letter written to French filmmaker Eugène Lauste, Méliès wrote that [...] "luckily enough, I am strong and in good health. But {{it is hard to}} work 14 hours a day without getting my Sundays or holidays, in an <b>icebox</b> in winter and a furnace in summer." ...|$|E
2500|$|All 39 {{episodes of}} The Honeymooners were filmed at the DuMont Television Network's [...] Adelphi Theatre at 152 West 54th Street in Manhattan, {{in front of}} an {{audience}} of 1,000. Episodes never were fully rehearsed because Gleason felt rehearsals would rob the show of its spontaneity. A result was that, while the cast was able to bring a fresh approach to the material, mistakes often were made. Lines either were recited incorrectly or altogether forgotten, and actors did not always follow the scripted action directions. To compensate, the cast developed visual cues for each other. For example, Gleason patted his stomach when he forgot a line, while Meadows would glance at the <b>icebox</b> when someone else was supposed to retrieve something from it.|$|E
2500|$|In 1969 the de Menils {{moved the}} Art Department—including the art history faculty—and Media Center to Rice University, where they founded the Institute for the Arts {{to manage the}} {{exhibition}} program at Rice Museum. Notable exhibitions at Rice Museum organized {{with the help of}} the de Menils were [...] "The Machine as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age," [...] curated by Pontus Hulten for the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and [...] "Raid the <b>Icebox</b> 1 with Andy Warhol," [...] an exhibition of objects selected by Warhol from the storage vaults of the Museum of Art at Rhode Island School of Design. At Rice John and Dominique de Menil also cultivated their interest in film; John de Menil was particularly interested in film as a tool for political and social activism in developing nations. They worked with such noted filmmakers as Roberto Rossellini, who made several trips to Houston to teach Rice University students and create television documentaries. Other filmmakers who visited the Media Center included Ola Balogun, Bernardo Bertolucci, James Blue, Jim McBride, and Colin Young.|$|E
50|$|The Freezers were {{originally}} {{known as the}} Munich Barons from 1999 until 2002, before team owner Philip Anschutz relocated the franchise to Hamburg for financial reasons on June 3, 2002.

2500|$|Before 1830, few Americans used ice to {{refrigerate}} foods {{due to a}} lack of ice-storehouses and <b>iceboxes.</b> As these two things became more widely available, individuals used axes and saws to harvest ice for their storehouses.

50|$|Production of {{domestic}} refrigerators lagged in the Soviet Union compared {{to some other}} countries. The first Soviet domestic refrigerators were produced at the Kharkov Tractor Factory in 1937, but World War II soon caused production to be halted.

50|$|Before {{the era of}} {{mechanical}} refrigeration, cooling for food storage occurred in the forms of root cellars and <b>iceboxes.</b> Rural people often did their own ice cutting, whereas town and city dwellers often relied on the ice trade. Today, root cellaring remains popular among people who value various goals, including local food, heirloom crops, traditional home cooking techniques, family farming, frugality, self-sufficiency, organic farming, and others.|$|R
50|$|Ice {{houses were}} used to store ice formed in the winter, to make ice {{available}} all year long, and early refrigerators were known as <b>iceboxes,</b> {{because they had a}} block of ice in them. In many cities, it was not unusual to have a regular ice delivery service during the summer. The advent of artificial refrigeration technology has since made delivery of ice obsolete.|$|R
