25|$|Glutamatergic neurons—glutamate. Glutamate {{is one of}} {{two primary}} {{excitatory}} amino acid neurotransmitter, the other being Aspartate. Glutamate receptors are one of four categories, three of which are ligand-gated ion channels and one of which is a <b>G-protein</b> <b>coupled</b> <b>receptor</b> (often referred to as GPCR).|$|E
25|$|Like all {{histamine}} receptors, the H3 receptor is a <b>G-protein</b> <b>coupled</b> <b>receptor.</b> The H3 receptor is {{coupled to}} the Gi G-protein, so {{it leads to}} inhibition {{of the formation of}} cAMP. Also, the β and γ subunits interact with N-type voltage gated calcium channels, to reduce action potential mediated influx of calcium and hence reduce neurotransmitter release.|$|E

40|$|The {{activities}} of many mammalian membrane proteins including <b>G-protein</b> <b>coupled</b> <b>receptors</b> are cholesterol-dependent. Unlike higher eukaryotes, yeast {{do not make}} cholesterol. Rather they make a related molecule called ergosterol.

To address this problem, {{we are trying to}} engineer a novel strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in which the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway of mammalian cells has been fully reconstituted.
