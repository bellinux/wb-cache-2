5|$|A {{number of}} risk scores exist to predict {{bleeding}} in people using warfarin and similar anticoagulants. A commonly used score (HAS-BLED) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled {{high blood pressure}} (H), abnormal kidney function (A), previous stroke (S), known previous bleeding condition (B), previous labile INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined by age over 65 (E), and drugs associated with bleeding (e.g. aspirin) or alcohol misuse (D). While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, they are only moderately effective <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> bleeding risk and do not perform well <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> hemorrhagic stroke. Bleeding risk may be increased in people on hemodialysis. Another score used to assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation, specifically Warfarin or Coumadin, is the ATRIA score, which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding risk stratification. The risks of bleeding are increased further when warfarin is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none have been shown to be useful <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> survival. The most {{important}} staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, or whether it is too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Franklin was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} storm over the western Atlantic Ocean during July of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the sixth named storm {{of the season and}} twice approached hurricane strength. The storm formed over the Bahamas on July 21 then moved north erratically, approaching Bermuda on July 26. Franklin eventually became extratropical near Newfoundland on July 30, before being absorbed by a larger system. The National Hurricane Center struggled to predict Tropical Storm Franklin mainly due to difficulties <b>in</b> <b>predicting</b> the effects of wind shear. There were only minor effects on land from Tropical Storm Franklin and no damages were caused. The name Franklin was used for the first time because of Hurricane Floyd which was retired in the 1999 season.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Several {{randomized}} controlled trials studied {{the role of}} endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) and endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) in acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP). No study assessed whether these trials resulted in international consensus in published meta-analyses and treatment guidelines. Methods: A systematic review, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, of meta-analyses and guidelines on ERCP in ABP was performed in PubMed until August 2011. The methodological quality of the meta-analysis and guidelines was assessed by a validated quality assessment tool. Results: Eight meta-analyses and 12 guidelines fulfilled the inclusion criteria. There is consensus that ERCP is indicated in case of ABP with coexistent cholangitis and/or persistent cholestasis. By exception of the first meta-analysis, all included studies disapproved early ERCP <b>in</b> <b>predicted</b> mild ABP. Consensus is lacking regarding the role of early ERCP <b>in</b> <b>predicted</b> severe ABP, as 3 meta-analyses and 1 guideline do not advice this strategy. Routine early ERCP <b>in</b> <b>predicted</b> severe ABP is recommended in 7 of the 11 guidelines. Conclusions: There is consensus in guidelines and meta-analyses that ERCP/ES is indicated in patients with ABP and coexisting cholangitis and/or persistent cholestasis.
