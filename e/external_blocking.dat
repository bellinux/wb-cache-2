50|$|Frustration {{originates}} from {{feelings of}} uncertainty and insecurity which {{stems from a}} sense of inability to fulfill needs. If the needs of an individual are blocked, uneasiness and frustration are more likely to occur. When these needs are constantly ignored or unsatisfied, anger, depression, loss of self-confidence, annoyance, aggression, and sometimes violence are likely to follow. Needs can be blocked two different ways; internally and externally. Internal blocking happens within an individual's mind, either through lack of ability, confidence, conflicting goals and desires, and/or fears. <b>External</b> <b>blocking</b> happens to an individual outside their control such as physical roadblocks, difficult tasks, or perceived waste of time.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{in detail}} the {{blocking}} and nonblocking behavior of multirate Clos switching networks at the connection/virtual connection level. The results are applicable to multirate circuit and fast-packet switching systems. Necessary and sufficient nonblocking conditions are derived analytically. Based on the results, an optimal bandwidth partitioning scheme is proposed to reduce switch complexity while maintaining the nonblocking property. The blocking behavior of blocking switches supporting multicast connections is investigated by means of simulation. We propose a novel simulation model that filters out <b>external</b> <b>blocking</b> events without distorting the bandwidth and fanout (for multicasting) distributions of connection requests. In this way, the internal blocking statistics that truly reflect the switch performance can be gathered and studied. Among many simulation results, we have shown that for point-to-multipoint connections, a heuristic routing policy that attempts to build a narrow multicast tree can have relatively low blocking probabilities compared with other routing policies. In addition, when small blocking probability can be tolerated, our results indicate that situations with many large-fanout connection requests do not necessarily require a switch architecture of higher complexity compared to that with only point-to-point requests...|$|E

40|$|The number, sign, and {{distribution}} of charged residues in the pore-forming H 5 domain for inward-rectifying K channels (IRK 1) {{are different from the}} otherwise homologous H 5 domains of other voltage-gated K channels. We have mutated Arg 148, which is perfectly conserved in all inward rectifiers, to His in the H 5 of IRK 1 (Kir 2. 1). Channel activity was lost by the mutation, but coexpression of the mutant (R 148 H) along with the wild-type (WT) mRNA revealed populations of channels with reduced single-channel conductances. Long-lasting and flickery sublevels were detected exclusively for the coexpressed channels. These findings indicated that the mutant subunit formed hetero-oligomers with the WT subunit. The permeability ratio was altered by the mutation, while the selectivity sequence (K+ > Rb+ > NH 4 + >> Na+) was preserved. The coexpression made the IRK 1 channel more sensitive to extracellular block by Mg 2 + and Ca 2 +, and turned this blockade from a voltage-independent to a -dependent process. The sensitivity of the mutant channels to Mg 2 + was enhanced at higher pH and by an increased ratio of mutant:WT mRNA, suggesting that the charge on the Arg site controlled the sensitivity. The blocking rate of open channel blockers, such as Cs+ and Ba 2 +, was facilitated by coexpression without significant change in the steady state block. Evaluation of the electrical distance to the binding site for Mg 2 + or Ca 2 + and that to the barrier peak for block by Cs+ or Ba 2 + suggest that Arg 148 is located between the <b>external</b> <b>blocking</b> site for Mg 2 + or Ca 2 + and the deeper blocking site for Cs+ or Ba 2 + in the IRK 1 channel.

The cells are deposited on thin flexible plastics at low temperature (120 ~ 150 °C). In the first part of study, a-Si:H n-i-p solar cells were fabricated using a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and the deposition conditions were optimized to maximize their efficiency. To improve light absorption, we engineered the front window layer by optimizing p-layer thickness and bandgap (Eg). The best a-Si:H n-i-p solar cell showed open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0. 67 V, short circuit current density (Jsc) of 7. 92 mA/cm 2, fill factor (FF) of 53. 73 %, and energy conversion efficiency of 2. 86 %. Using developed deposition recipes, the a-Si:H PV modules were designed and fabricated on a 10 by 10 cm 2 polyethylene-naphthalate (PEN) substrate which consists of 72 rectangular cells. The sub-cells were connected in series forming eight strings with connection pads at the ends, so that the strings of 18 sub-cells were connected in parallel using the <b>external</b> <b>blocking</b> diodes. The typical a-Si:H PV module showed Voc of 12. 78 V, Jsc of 8 mA/cm 2, FF of 53. 8 %, and average efficiency of 3. 05 %. The PV module performance is similar to that of individual solar cells, which means good scalability of our module fabrication process. In the second part, a-Si:H n-i-p solar cells were inverted to fabricate a-Si:H p-i-n solar cells. In this device structure, p-type buffer-layer was introduced to improve the interface between aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) /p-layer. The optimum device showed Voc of 0. 885 V, Jsc of 8. 88 mA/cm 2, FF of 52. 01 %, and efficiency of 4. 09 %. In the last part of this study, semi-transparent solar cells were fabricated both on glass and plastic substrates to demonstrate feasibility of building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV), based on the a-Si:H p-i-n cells in the second part.
