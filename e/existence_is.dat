5|$|Caragiale used Mitică as a stock {{character}} to feature in satirical contexts; the biographical insights he provided are short and often contradict each other. Among Mitică's traits are his tendency to generate sarcastic comebacks and sententious catchphrases, a Francized speech, {{as well as}} inclinations to waste time and easily find {{his way out of}} problematic situations. His <b>existence</b> <b>is</b> connected to events in the history of Bucharest which he occasionally references in his jokes. Like Lache and Mache, who are present in Caragiale's fiction, the character is usually portrayed as a civil servant who has a hard time making ends meet, but who is well liked by his peers.|$|E
5|$|Consensus has {{determined}} sea turtles, including E. imbricata to be, {{at the very}} least, threatened species because of their slow growth and maturity, and slow reproductive rates. Many adult turtles {{have been killed by}} humans, both accidentally and deliberately. Their <b>existence</b> <b>is</b> threatened due to pollution and loss of nesting areas because of coastal development. Biologist guess that the hawkbill population has declined 80 percent in the past hundred years. Human and animal encroachment threatens nesting sites, and small mammals dig up the eggs to eat. In the US Virgin Islands, mongooses raid hawksbill nests (along with those of other sea turtles, such as Dermochelys coriacea) right after they are laid.|$|E

5|$|Darwin's aims were twofold: to {{show that}} species had not been {{separately}} created, and {{to show that}} natural selection had been the chief agent of change. He knew that his readers were already familiar {{with the concept of}} transmutation of species from Vestiges, and his introduction ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism. Therefore, the first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature, caused by the struggle for <b>existence,</b> <b>is</b> analogous to the selection of variations under domestication, and that the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary speciation.|$|E
5|$|Descartes {{argued that}} God's {{existence}} can be deduced from his nature, just as geometric ideas can be deduced {{from the nature}} of shapes—he used the deduction of the sizes of angles in a triangle as an example. He suggested {{that the concept of}} God is that of a supremely perfect being, holding all perfections. He seems to have assumed that <b>existence</b> <b>is</b> a predicate of a perfection. Thus, if the notion of God did not include existence, it would not be supremely perfect, as it would be lacking a perfection. Consequently, the notion of a supremely perfect God who does not exist, Descartes argues, is unintelligible. Therefore, according to his nature, God must exist.|$|E
5|$|<b>Existence</b> <b>is</b> a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where there is nothing more perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of a thing is the thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either <b>existence</b> <b>is</b> independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of existence, and imperfection is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E

5|$|Gasking {{asserted}} {{that the creation of}} the world is the most marvellous achievement imaginable. The merit of such an achievement is the product of its quality and the creator's disability: the greater the disability of the creator, the more impressive the achievement. Non-existence, Gasking asserts, would be the greatest handicap. Therefore, if the universe is the product of an existent creator, we could conceive of a greater being—one which does not exist. A non-existent creator is greater than one which exists, so God does not exist. Gasking's proposition that the greatest disability would be non-existence is a response to Anselm's assumption that <b>existence</b> <b>is</b> a predicate and perfection. Gasking uses this logic to assume that non-existence must be a disability.|$|E

5|$|Her Battle for <b>Existence</b> <b>is</b> a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The fictional drama follows Susan Dale, a young woman used to luxury. She chooses between two suitors, but her fiancé breaks the engagement off after Susan's father loses his money and life. Susan now tries to support herself, but fails in the role and decides to kill herself. Her other suitor rushes in and stops her suicide and they get married. Little {{is known about the}} production of the film, but it was released as a split reel with Sand Man's Cure on April 22, 1910. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|Hume also {{suggested}} that, {{as we have}} no abstract idea of existence (apart from {{as part of our}} ideas of other objects), we cannot claim that the idea of God implies his existence. He suggested that any conception of God we may have, we can conceive either of existing or of not existing. He believed that <b>existence</b> <b>is</b> not a quality (or perfection), so a completely perfect being need not exist. Thus, he claimed {{that it is not a}} contradiction to deny God's existence. Although this criticism is directed against a cosmological argument, similar to that of Samuel Clarke in his first Boyle Lecture, it has been applied to ontological arguments as well.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the intrinsic magnetic moment, Ganymede has an induced dipole magnetic field. Its <b>existence</b> <b>is</b> connected with the variation of the Jovian magnetic field near Ganymede. The induced moment is directed radially to or from Jupiter following {{the direction of the}} varying part of the planetary magnetic field. The induced magnetic moment is an order of magnitude weaker than the intrinsic one. The field strength of the induced field at the magnetic equator is about 60 nT—half of that of the ambient Jovian field. The induced magnetic field of Ganymede is similar to those of Callisto and Europa, indicating that Ganymede also has a subsurface water ocean with a high electrical conductivity.|$|E
5|$|King Arthur is {{a legendary}} British leader who, {{according}} to medieval histories and romances, led the defence of Britain against Saxon invaders {{in the late}} 5th and early 6th centuries AD.

The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources, including the Annales Cambriae, the Historia Brittonum, and the writings of Gildas. Arthur's name also occurs in early poetic sources such as Y Gododdin.|$|E

5|$|The Falklands {{remained}} uninhabited {{until the}} 1764 establishment of Port Louis on East Falkland by French captain Louis Antoine de Bougainville, and the 1766 foundation of Port Egmont on Saunders Island by British captain John MacBride.

In 1766, France surrendered its claim on the Falklands to Spain, which renamed the French colony Puerto Soledad the following year. Problems began when Spain discovered and captured Port Egmont in 1770. War was narrowly avoided by its restitution to Britain in 1771.|$|E
5|$|The arcs in the Adams ring remain unexplained. Their <b>existence</b> <b>is</b> {{a puzzle}} because basic orbital {{dynamics}} imply {{that they should}} spread out into a uniform ring over a matter of years. Several theories about the arcs' confinement have been suggested, the most widely publicized of which holds that Galatea confines the arcs via its 42:43 co-rotational inclination resonance (CIR). The resonance creates 84 stable sites along the ring's orbit, each 4° long, with arcs residing in the adjacent sites. However measurements of the rings' mean motion with Hubble and Keck telescopes in 1998 led {{to the conclusion that}} the rings are not in CIR with Galatea.|$|E
