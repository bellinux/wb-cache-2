A Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is here used for projecting future quantities of <b>hazardous</b> and <b>non-hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> in Sweden to 2030. The effects of driving forces behind waste generation are illustrated {{by comparing the results}} of waste projections for a Baseline scenario and four alternative scenarios.

We use a high-resolution data set on waste flows of 18 various types of <b>non-hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> and 16 various types of hazardous waste attributed to six waste-generating sources for the base year 2006. Waste generated in the scenarios, thus, relate to firms’ material input, output, employees, capital scrapping and fuel combustion as well as households’ consumption. The impact of economic growth in increasing the generation of nonhazardous and hazardous waste is apparent when comparing the growth of waste from 2006 to 2030 in the five scenarios. On the contrary, technological change resulting in less waste intensive production processes and changed behaviour among households, making their activities less waste intensive, have a strong reducing effect, especially on generation of <b>non-hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> relating to firms’ material input. general equilibrium model; waste generation; decoupling; waste intensities waste scenarios. ...|$|R

To tackle this problem of continuing waste growth, the EU has on its agenda that waste generation should decouple from economic growth within the EU in the future.

The strength of the policy measures needed to attain this target is here illustrated by comparing the waste intensity outcomes in a 'Decoupling scenario' and a 'Baseline scenario' of the Swedish economy 2006 - 2030. A Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is used for linking waste generation to firms' material input, firms' production and households' consumption when projecting future quantities of <b>hazardous</b> and <b>non-hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> in Sweden. We show that to offset the effect of economic growth on waste generation in the 'Decoupling scenario', the intensities of material-related wastes must decrease at a yearly rate that is about twice the historically estimated reduction rate used in the 'Baseline scenario'.

Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted amongst 320 Health care Personnels. A pre-designed and pre-tested structured questionnaire was used for data collection. A self made scoring system was devised to categorize KAP as good, average and poor. Data entry and analysis was done using SPSS version 20. Results: Doctors had majority of those with good knowledge and attitude, nurses had the same in practice while cleaning staff had majority of those with poor KAP as compared to all other categories.

Scrap metal including other materials (e. g., drums, obsolete equipment) not related to this upgrade program have thus far accumulated in nine contiguous radiologically-contaminated and non-contaminated scrap yards covering 1. 05 E 5 m 2 (26 acres) located in the northwestern portion of the PGDP.

NRS includes the use of energy, water and materials whereas EBS is given by the environmental sustainability metrics developed by the Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE).

Then, a scheduling pattern or sequence is determined for each machine. A neural network is used to accomplish this task. Two scenarios with different scheduling patterns are then compared using simulation and statistical analysis.

40|$|AbstractMunicipal {{solid waste}} {{incineration}} (MSWI) fly ash {{is classified as}} a hazardous waste due to its high content of leachable heavy metals. Currently, cement-based stabilization process before landfill has attracted much attention since it can transform the <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> into <b>non-hazardous</b> <b>waste.</b> It is known that MSWI fly ash in China has high-level of soluble chlorides, which has {{a negative effect on}} the stabilization of the solidified matrix. In this study, therefore, a water washing pre-treatment process was applied to remove chlorides as much as possible. Experiments were conducted at the conditions of liquid-to-solid (L/S) ratio of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 and washing time of 0. 5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 h for the washing process. Based on the analysis, the MSWI fly ash with L/S ratio of 10 and washing time of 2 h was selected for the subsequent experiment. The washed fly ash and raw fly ash were then mixed with different amounts of cement and placed into the mould for 7, 14 and 28 days, respectively. The results showed that cement-based solidification process exhibited the maximum compressive strength of 7. 87 MPa when the addition of cement was 67 % and the maintenance period was 7 days. Besides, toxic characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) tests showed that the solidified matrix can meet the requirement of landfill...|$|R
