40|$|International audienceFor its own safety, a {{robot system}} should never find {{itself in a}} state where there is no {{feasible}} trajectory to avoid collision with an obstacle. Such a state is an Inevitable Collision State (ICS). The ICS concept is particularly useful for navigation in dynamic environments because it takes into account <b>the</b> <b>future</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moving objects. Accordingly it requires a model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> environment. In the real-world, <b>the</b> <b>future</b> trajectories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obstacles are generally unknown and only estimates are available. This paper introduces a probabilistic formulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ICS concept which incorporates uncertainty in <b>the</b> model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> trajectories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obstacles. It also presents two novel probabilistic ICSchecking algorithms that are compared with their deterministic counterpart...|$|R
