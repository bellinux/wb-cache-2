5|$|Makeba {{then moved}} to New York, making her US music debut on 1 November 1959 on The Steve Allen Show in Los Angeles for a {{television}} audience of 60 million. <b>Her</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> debut at the Village Vanguard occurred soon after; she sang in Xhosa and Zulu, and performed a Yiddish folk song. Her audience at this concert included Miles Davis and Duke Ellington; her performance received strongly positive reviews from critics. She first came to popular and critical attention in jazz clubs, after which her reputation grew rapidly. Belafonte, who had helped Makeba with her move to the US, handled the logistics for her first performances. When she first moved to the US, Makeba lived in Greenwich Village, along with other musicians and actors. As was common in her profession, she experienced some financial insecurity, {{and worked as a}} babysitter for a period.|$|E
5|$|Fraser's {{experiences}} {{as an intern}} convinced her that she would prefer medical research to actual practice with patients. When she completed <b>her</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> internship in 1926, she moved to Philadelphia, after a brief visit home to Toronto to visit {{her mother and her}} brother Donald. In Pennsylvania, Fraser began her post-doctorate training under the direction of Muriel McPhedran at the Phipps Institute for the Study, Treatment and Prevention of Tuberculosis in January 1927, specialising in bacteriology The experiences in her internships were markedly different in that in New York, she lived at the hospital and the staff was predominantly made up of women. In Philadelphia, she lived in her own apartment in the town and often had to struggle to be accepted as a doctor and be able to see patients. In March, 1927, Fraser was offered a position in the Connaught Laboratories, a research facility dedicated to developing vaccines, where her brother worked. Accepting the position to begin {{at the end of her}} internship in October meant that she would not be joining Williams in England. Williams had hoped that Fraser would join her, where they might be able to live together, but recognized with the choice of going back to Toronto, that would not be possible.|$|E

25|$|During the First World War, Duff Gordon's focus {{shifted to}} <b>her</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> office {{which she had}} opened in 1910. For <b>her</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> fashion shows she {{imported}} her own models from England, although Dolores was not among the first she brought over. The shows became so popular {{that she had to}} start holding them in a theatre. It was probably at one such event around 1916 that Florenz Ziegfeld and his wife Billie Burke discovered Duff Gordon's designs and her model Dolores. Ziegfeld was enraptured by Dolores and the luxurious spectacle of the show and Burke ordered two of Duff Gordon's creations. Soon, Duff Gordon was making costumes for Ziegfeld's theatrical productions, the Ziegfeld Follies.|$|E
