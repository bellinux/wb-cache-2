5|$|The {{construction}} of the venue cost NOK230 million, which was almost entirely financed through state grants. Hamar Municipality contributed by building a co-located fire station for NOK21 million. Local businesses also contributed with NOK8 million. Moelven Industrier and Fireguard both contributed in exchange {{for being able to}} use the venues for marketing large wooden structures. To finance the operating deficit after the Olympics, Hamar Municipality received a capital grant of NOK30 million, with the interest <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> running Vikingskipet and Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre. Operating costs were estimated at NOK7 million per year; the venue will receive income of NOK1 million from larger events, NOK1 million will come from free work from the fire department, and NOK1 million from advertisements. Similar to Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre, the venue has two official names, Hamar Olympic Hall and Vikingskipet. The former cannot be used commercially by non-Olympic events, such as in merchandise.|$|E
25|$|Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto would unite {{to oust the}} {{president}} who lost {{the control of the}} country in a matter of weeks. Khan too was forced to resign along with Nawaz Sharif in 1993, and an interim government was formed until the new elections. A parliamentary election was called after by the Pakistan Armed Forces. Both Sharif and Benazir Bhutto campaigned with full force, targeting each other's personalities. Their policies were very similar but a clash of personalities occurred, with both parties making many promises but not explaining how they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> them.|$|E
25|$|It {{looked as}} if the Romans were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> their failure to {{capitalize}} from the victory at the Metaurus river by conquering the Cisalpine Gauls once and for all, but the danger caused by Mago’s landing was not to be overestimated. Even when he received reinforcements from Carthage in the form of about 7,000 troops, 7 elephants and 25 warships his strength was still far from enough to break the Roman defences. This is why Mago did not seem to actively pursue the goal set by Carthage – to march south and join Hannibal.|$|E

25|$|In {{practical}} terms, Louis X effectively abolished slavery {{within the}} Kingdom of France in 1315. Louis continued to require revenues, however, and alighted on a reform of French serfdom {{as a way}} of achieving this. Arguing that all men are born free, Louis declared in 1315 that French serfs would therefore be freed, although each serf would have to purchase his freedom. A body of commissioners was established to undertake the reform, establishing the peculium, or value, of each serf. For serfs owned directly by the King, all of the peculium would be received by the Crown – for serfs owned by subjects of the King, the amount would be divided between the Crown and the owner. In the event, not all serfs were prepared to pay in this fashion and in due course Louis declared that the goods of these serfs would be seized anyway, with the proceeds <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the war in Flanders.|$|E
500|$|Soon, however, {{discourse}} about Till's murder became more complex. Robert B. Patterson, executive {{secretary of the}} segregationist White Citizens' Council, lamented Till's death by repeating that racial segregation policies were to provide for blacks' safety and that their efforts were being neutralized by the NAACP. In response, NAACP executive secretary Roy Wilkins characterized the incident as a lynching and said that Mississippi was trying to maintain white supremacy through murder. He said, [...] "there is in the entire state no restraining influence of decency, not in the state capital, among the daily newspapers, the clergy, nor any segment of the so-called better citizens." [...] Mamie Till Bradley told a reporter that she would seek legal aid to help law enforcement find her son's killers and that the State of Mississippi should share the financial responsibility. She was misquoted; it was reported as [...] "Mississippi is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> this." ...|$|E
500|$|Dennis {{explained}} that his character is oblivious to Robert's intentions and believes Robert is taking {{him on a}} family camping holiday. When Robert has Paul alone he drugs him and {{take him to the}} mineshaft. Robert admits to causing the plane crash which killed the Bishop family, intending Paul, Elle and Izzy to die. Dennis {{explained that}} Robert [...] "really goes to town telling Paul what a terrible father he's been and how he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> it now." [...] Robert gloats about his successful scheming and seals the entrance to the mine leaving Paul for dead. But Katya Kinski (Dichen Lachman) begins to suspect that Robert is mentally ill and it is up to her to convince other residents and save Paul from death. Paul escapes but Katya is next to be kidnapped by Robert because he is infatuated with her. She decides to humour Robert in the hope he will return her to Erinsborough. But Robert discovers that Paul plans to marry his mother Gail. He is unaware that it is a ruse set-up by authorities to arrest him. Katya convinces Robert that they should not leave together because he has a final chance to kill Paul at the wedding.|$|E

On Sunday 7 December 1941, while peeling potatoes, DeShazer heard news of the attack on Pearl Harbor over the radio.

2500|$|When {{asked about}} all the missed {{opportunities}} against Levante in La Liga and Auxerre in the Champions League, Mourinho said, [...] "One day some poor rival is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the chances we've missed today." [...] The following match at the Bernabéu ended with a 6–1 victory over Deportivo de La Coruña. The following league games confirmed Mourinho's statement, defeating Málaga by 1–4 and Racing de Santander again by 6–1.|$|E

[...] The store owner's son was hit with a bottle of beer, and two other youths smashed the glass front door of the store. Two officers from the 77th Street Division of the LAPD responded to this incident and, finding that the instigators had already left, completed a report.|$|E

[...] That new venture, called Xmobb, was created by Lorne Lanning and his longtime business partner, Oddworld co-founder and CEO Sherry McKenna, along with Daniel Goldman (co-founder of the Total Entertainment Network) in Emeryville, California.

Korey Wise, 16 {{years old at the}} time of the crime, was acquitted of those charges, but convicted of sexual abuse, assault, and riot in the attack on the jogger and others in the park, and sentenced to 5–15 years.

He should pay for it. He's got the money." [...] Fox went on to call Trump a [...] "crazy guy" [...] and a [...] "false prophet," [...] and questioned the claim that Trump received 44% of the Hispanic vote in the Republican caucus in Nevada. Trump took to Twitter in response, demanding that Fox apologize for using [...] "the F word while discussing the wall." [...] Fox eventually apologized for the remark, while also asking for Trump to apologize for his remarks about Mexicans and inviting Trump to visit Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Overlook, a {{hospital}} in northern New Jersey {{and away from the}} large urban centers, was contrasted with the urban hospital of St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center. St. Joseph's had a much greater percentage of charity patients; a reporter wrote: [...] "the bills of patients who have health insurance or who can otherwise pay are marked up 33 percent, the surcharge <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> charity care;" [...] in contrast, Overlook, which has a wealthier client base, only had a 6 percent charity markup. As a result, Overlook operated with a surplus while St. Joseph's was cash-strapped. Since Overlook could pay suppliers on time, it qualified for discounts based on the [...] "quantity of its purchases" [...] while the urban hospital had to pay extra charges.|$|E

Cocoa Fusco reveals that the order to kill Malcolm X came from Chicago on 5 July 1964.|$|R

I think Columbia was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> it at one point, but they insisted he have a union engineer with him and someone extra like that—in situations we were going to be in would have been hopeless. So he refused, and they withdrew their funding. It was very last minute that the Ertegun brothers at Atlantic gave us the cash and we were gone within days of getting that money. Alan had wanted to do it earlier, but there was just no money to do it with. He had no money, ever. He was always living hand to mouth.|$|E
