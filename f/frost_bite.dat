In this study, 234 patients of various degrees of cold injuries were treated with a standard protocol of multidrug therapy {{with a view to}} combat the effects of cold injury at various steps of pathogenesis. Deep <b>frost</b> <b>bite</b> cases were subjected to Hyperbaric Oxygen therapy (HBOT). An encouraging result was found in our study with this protocol. There was less morbidity. Healing time, hospital stay and loss of digits were less. Multidrug therapy with Pentoxyphylline, Ibuprofen and soluble aspirin was a better treatment modality than single drug used in the treatment of cold injuries. HBOT was found to reduce morbidity to a great extent along with saving a number of digits from amputation...|$|E
40|$|There {{are more}} than 10 million {{physically}} handicapped people in India. A majority of them belong to poor strata of the society. In the present condition prosthetic fitment centers are not sufficient {{to deal with such}} large amputee population. Children are mostly victim of society in low per capita income country in general. Children with congenital amputation, loss of limb with street accidents/trauma, <b>frost</b> <b>bite</b> etc need special attention for the prosthetic fitment. More than 80 % of major amputations of the lower extremity are attributed to peripheral vascular disease 1. About 10 percent of congenital anomalies are treated as, or require, amputation 2. As children are in the growing age, the prosthetic device is required to be changed frequently. This accelerated rehabilitation greatly reduced the overall cost of the patient’s care and returned them to full function much faster 3. The major constraint in frequent change of prosthetic device in developing country is lack of sufficient number of prosthetic fitment center, skilled prosthetists, paediatric prosthetic kits and low income group of amputee. To face this challenge we have designed a low cost Paediatric prostheti...|$|E

40|$|SummaryMalignant {{neoplasm}} arising in chronic, non-healing wounds {{has been}} known since ages and it was named Marjolin's ulcer about one hundred years ago. This scar malignancy arises in burned, constantly injured or chronically inflamed skin. Such pathologies as osteomyelitis, decubitus ulcers, chronic fistulas, <b>frost</b> <b>bite,</b> chronic venous failure, vaccination sites, skin graft donor sites and chronically traumatized skin are numbered among the etiological factors. Despite these numerous risk factors this oncological syndrome is rarely diagnosed and commonly mistaken, thus it may often be overlooked. Marjolin's ulcer may be defined by many pathological types of neoplasms. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most commonly identified histological type followed by basal cell carcinoma (BCC), malignant melanoma, sarcomas (fibrosarcoma, liposarcoma, dermatofi-brosarcoma protuberans, mesenchymal tumor), mixed tumors: SCC-BCC, SCC-melanoma and others. There is an agreement over the prevention methods with skin grafting of burned areas and excision with simultaneous grafting of ulcerations appearing in non-healing wounds. To date, {{there has not been}} a consensus reached over the treatment protocol. Wide surgical excision seems to be the most preferred method. Inoperable cases and recurrences may be treated with radiotherapy alone or combined with chemotherapy...|$|E

Being a cold desert, there is a saying that a person who has his head in a sun and his feet in a shade will endure both sun-stroke and <b>frost</b> <b>bite</b> at the same time, this extreme weather as well as climatic temperatures variation makes life very difficult in Ladakh. In summer the temperature is 20 ℃ to 27 ℃ whereas the in winter the temperature drops to - 20 ℃ to - 27 ℃ and in areas like Zanskar it drops below - 40 ℃. For centuries Ladakh region has enjoyed a stable economy based on self reliance mainly through its subsistence agricultural economy growing mainly barley, wheat, vegetables, and plantations and remaining from livestock within the duration of short summer season of 6 to 7 months in a year. But over the past few decades especially from 1970 's when Ladakh was opened to the outside world, Ladakh's self reliance stable economy has shifted to dependence on outside forces, mainly the presence of large army and huge influx of foreign tourist, has lead to an uncontrollable money and materialistic driven economy in the present scenario. 'Change' and 'Development' are inevitable but it does not have to necessary the adaptation of western and modern culture having the notion of materialistic culture of having a job and buying what you need, leaving behind the culture of having concept of producing it yourself.

40|$|Leeching {{has enjoyed}} a good {{reputation}} in the past {{where it had been}} used in various ailments from fevers to flatulence. The present day scientists have limited its role and the leeching nowadays is being used only in microsurgeries to relieve the venous congestion. This study was designed to explore the possibility of revival of the leech therapy (leeching) which is still being used traditionally as therapeutic agent in various ailments. Leeching is not the outcome of the medieval period but has been in use during the times when there was no concept of the disease and medicament. The earliest clearly documented record of leeches being used for remedial purpose appears in a painting in an Egyptian Tomb of around 1500 BC. The journey of the leech therapy reached its zenith in 17 th and 18 th century AD in Europe while as during the Arab era the leeches were used medicinally but only for the bloodletting. During the 17 th and 18 th century AD there was shortage of leeches in certain European countries due to its rigorous use. During early 20 th century AD when germ theory was put forward and medical fraternity believed that every disease has its origin from germs and the era of antibacterial therapy gained a pace, the leech therapy was considered the myth of the past. It was in 1970 `s that the leech therapy was revived by only limited to the microsurgeries to relieve venous congestions. During the 21 st century there were certain studies when the leeches were tried in certain ailments like arthritis etc. and the Food and Drug Authority of USA (FDA) gave permission for sale and use of leeches in USA but limited its use in microsurgeries and plastic surgeries only. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore different diseases where the role of leech therapy can be seen and clinical trials can be started in this direction.
