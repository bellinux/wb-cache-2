5|$|Finally, {{the third}} major factor behind the {{resolution}} of the financial crisis was the decision by the government of Iceland to apply for membership in the EU in July 2009. While views on the feasibility of EU membership are quite mixed in Iceland, this action has served to enhance the credibility of the country on international financial markets. One sign {{of the success of the}} above <b>efforts</b> <b>is</b> the fact that the Icelandic government was successfully able to raise $1 billion with a bond issue on 9 June 2011. This development indicates that international investors have given the government and the new banking system, with two of the three biggest banks now in foreign hands, a clean bill of health. The first two major measures were implemented by the government of Geir H. Haarde but also carried out by the government of Johanna Sigurdardottir, which then took the step to apply for EU membership.|$|E
5|$|Other hunting traditions then follow, again {{rooted in}} religion. The warriors of the Kuru tribe in Africa commit a sacred act {{in which they}} copulate with the ground in belief that it will make the Earth fertile and produce animals for the hunt, and a stag hunt in France, rooted in ancient pagan beliefs of the Gauls, is blessed by a mass before the hunt takes place, during which the hunters and dogs chase and {{ultimately}} kill a fleeing stag. In a fox hunt, the Wild Fox Association sabotages the hunting efforts by serving wine laced with a laxative to the hunters and distracting the dogs with an Afghan bitch in heat. Their efforts are then connected to species conservation, and to exemplify that hunters are truly concerned in wildlife conservation, Argentine hunters capture an Andean condor to sell to a zoo. A collage of other conservation <b>efforts</b> <b>is</b> shown, including the tagging of white rhinoceroses, grizzly bears and elephants, which are shot with morphine darts. Argentinian deer and elephant seals are physically subdued and marked. Tourists on Africans safaris then come to view the conservation efforts, which the narrator claims to have seemingly negated the animals' violent instincts. This deception is demonstrated with the mauling of a tourist named Pit Dernitz by lions.|$|E

50|$|Vocal <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> a {{quantity}} varied by speakers when adjusting {{to an increase}} or decrease in the communication distance. The communication distance is {{the distance between the}} speaker and the listener. Vocal <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> a subjective physiological quantity, and is mainly dependent on subglottal pressure, vocal fold tension and jaw opening. Vocal <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> different from sound pressure. To measure vocal <b>effort,</b> listeners <b>are</b> asked to rate the distance between speaker and addressee.|$|R

25|$|Within {{the city}} {{there are many}} lawns, trees and other greenery. Due to water {{resource}} issues, {{there has been a}} movement to encourage xeriscapes. Another part of conservation <b>efforts</b> <b>is</b> scheduled watering days for residential landscaping. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency grant in 2008 funded a program that analyzed and forecast growth and environmental impacts through the year 2019.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} goal {{of conservation}} <b>efforts</b> <b>is</b> {{to reduce the}} threat of extinction by creating captive and wild populations. Biologists have attempted to establish a beetle population releasing laboratory-raised American burying beetles on Penikese Island and Nantucket island in Massachusetts. Biologists return each year to both islands to study the survival and growth of the beetle population.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{a long-standing}} {{agreement}} among many experts that geological disposal can be safe, technologically feasible and environmentally sound, {{a large part}} of the general public in many countries remains skeptical.

25|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} faced by pediatric safety and quality <b>efforts</b> <b>is</b> {{that most of the}} work on patient safety to date has focused on adult patients. In addition, there is no standard nomenclature for pediatric patient safety that is widely used. However, a standard framework for classifying pediatric adverse events that offers flexibility has been introduced. Standardization provides consistency between interdisciplinary teams and can facilitate multisite studies. If these large-scale studies are conducted, the findings could generate large-scale intervention studies conducted with a faster life cycle.|$|E

25|$|In fact, {{the role}} of social media in digital {{humanitarian}} <b>efforts</b> <b>is</b> a considerable one. During the summer of 2010, when open fires raged across Russia, causing many to die from smog inhalation, the use of social media allowed digital humanitarians to map the areas in need of support. This is because Russians who were hoping to be evacuated were posting online about the conditions they were in which prompted thousands of Russian bloggers to coordinate relief efforts online. The digital humanitarian efforts in Russia were crucial to responding to the fires in 2010 considering the Russian government was vastly unprepared {{to deal with such}} a large-scale disaster.|$|E
40|$|Objectives {{were listed}} for four areas: {{engineering}} science, reliability physics, module development, and module performance and failure analysis.

40|$|By definition, giving 100 % effort all of {{the time}} is sustainable, but begs the {{question}} of how to define 100 % effort. As a corollary, once a benchmark for defining 100 % <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> chosen, it may be possible, even optimal, to give a greater amount of effort for a short period of time, while recognizing that this level of <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> not sustainable. This dynamic <b>effort</b> provision problem <b>is</b> analyzed in the context of effort and performance by National Basketball Association (NBA) players over the course of a season. Within this context, several benchmarks for sustainable <b>effort</b> <b>are</b> considered, but these are rejected by the data.

25|$|With {{the advent}} of quantum {{mechanics}} in the 1920s, and with successive advances in quantum field theory, the importance of gauge transformations has steadily grown. Gauge theories constrain the laws of physics, because all the changes induced by a gauge transformation have to {{cancel each other out}} when written in terms of observable quantities. Over the course of the 20th century, physicists gradually realized that all forces (fundamental interactions) arise from the constraints imposed by local gauge symmetries, in which case the transformations vary from point to point in space and time. Perturbative quantum field theory (usually employed for scattering theory) describes forces in terms of force-mediating particles called gauge bosons. The nature of these particles is determined {{by the nature of the}} gauge transformations. The culmination of these <b>efforts</b> <b>is</b> the Standard Model, a quantum field theory that accurately predicts all of the fundamental interactions except gravity.|$|E
25|$|A renewed {{interest}} on the site's importance in the 1980s was sparked by the visit to the site by the late Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1970. This led {{to the protection of}} the complex's remains as a national monument in 1987, through the national heritage legislation. A landscape project over a part of the site and a series of restoration works were initiated in the 1990s. The lack of a formal conservation plan or a methodical archaeological approach have call into question the site's historic authenticity. 2001 was a landmark year for the site. The Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund was established to manage the site directly. Its responsibilities include overseeing the excavations and implementing corrective actions on restorations that were haphazardly done since the 1990s. Among the previous preservation works that are being reversed are the landscape project, the hospital building's roof installation, which unfortunately used modern materials, the use of native lime mortar technique in the reconstruction and maintenance of the remaining stone walls, and devising an archaeological strategy to document finds and discoveries, as well as to safeguard the existing artifacts. The objective of the conservation <b>efforts</b> <b>is</b> for the site to regain its appearance in the 1860s. The site's name was officially changed to Aapravasi Ghat that same year. The name change was not without controversy. Although it was meant to reflect the Hindu Indian majority of indentured laborers, the use of the Hindi translation swept away the myriad of other ethnic and religious populations that also passed through the Immigration Depot.|$|E
