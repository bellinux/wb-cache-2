5|$|Schwarzkopf retired {{shortly after}} the end of the war and {{undertook}} a number of philanthropic ventures, only occasionally stepping <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> spotlight before his death from complications of pneumonia in late 2012. A hard-driving military commander with a strong temper, Schwarzkopf was considered an exceptional leader by biographers and was noted for his abilities as a military diplomat and in dealing with the press.|$|E
5|$|Stanley's first venture <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> arena was in 1897 {{when he made}} an {{unsuccessful}} bid to become county attorney of Fleming County. He continued to practice law in Flemingsburg until March 1898 {{when he moved to}} Henderson because of financial hardships. He served as a Democratic presidential elector on the ticket of William Jennings Bryan in 1900.|$|E
5|$|During World WarII, Brundage {{wrote to}} other IOC members {{that he had}} no {{objection}} to Soviet involvement in international sports, with representation on the IOC, if the USSR joined the international sports federations (ISFs). The IOC required that an NOC be independent of the government of the territory which it represents; there were concerns a Soviet NOC would not be. This was a problem not unique to communist states; a number of Latin Americans countries were starting to bring the local NOCs <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> structure, with an official naming the NOC chair—who might even be the country's political leader. This mixture of sports and politics worried Brundage.|$|E

5|$|Ravalomanana's family origins are Merina, the island's {{largest and}} most {{politically}} prominent ethnic group. The Ravalomanana family tomb is outside the historic walls of the village, a placement that would typically indicate the family's origins lie with the hova (commoners' caste), rather than the andriana — the traditional ruling caste among the Merina that continues to exert considerable influence over political affairs in modern Madagascar. His later entry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> sphere has made the question of his caste background one of popular interest and ongoing debate among the Malagasy public and press. Biographer Vivier (2007) maintains that the Ravalomanana family is andriana in origin.|$|E
5|$|Some {{factions in}} the ACLU {{proposed}} {{new directions for}} the organization. In the late 1930s, some local affiliates proposed shifting their emphasis from civil liberties appellate actions, to becoming a legal aid society, centered on store front offices in low income neighborhoods. The ACLU directors rejected that proposal. Other ACLU members wanted the ACLU to shift focus <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> arena, and to {{be more willing to}} compromise their ideals in order to strike deals with politicians. This initiative was also rejected by the ACLU leadership.|$|E
5|$|A {{struggle}} over {{the power of the}} purse brought Adams back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> limelight. Traditionally, the Massachusetts House of Representatives paid the salaries of the governor, lieutenant governor, and superior court judges. From the Whig perspective, this arrangement was an important check on executive power, keeping royally appointed officials accountable to democratically elected representatives. In 1772, Massachusetts learned that those officials would henceforth be paid by the British government rather than by the province. To protest this development, Adams and his colleagues devised a system of committees of correspondence in November 1772; the towns of Massachusetts would consult with each other concerning political matters via messages sent through a network of committees that recorded British activities and protested imperial policies. Committees of correspondence soon formed in other colonies, as well.|$|E

5|$|In 1533, {{at the age}} of fourteen, Catherine married Henry, {{second son}} of King Francis I and Queen Claude of France. Throughout his reign, Henry {{excluded}} Catherine from participating in state affairs and instead showered favours on his chief mistress, Diane de Poitiers, who wielded much influence over him. Henry's death thrust Catherine <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> arena as mother of the frail fifteen-year-old King Francis II. When he died in 1560, she became regent on behalf of her ten-year-old son King Charles IX and was granted sweeping powers. After Charles died in 1574, Catherine {{played a key role in}} the reign of her third son, Henry III. He dispensed with her advice only in the last months of her life.|$|E
5|$|Rajoelina's {{business}} affairs gradually {{drew him}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> arena. Shortly after Ravalomanana won the presidential elections in 2001, Rajoelina befriended the new president's daughter {{and continued to}} expand {{his relationship with the}} capital's political elite {{over the course of the}} Ravalomanana presidency. He assumed an increasingly political role after the policies of Ravalomanana's Tiako I Madagasikara (TIM)-dominated government increasingly obstructed the expansion of his business activities, such as requiring the removal of Antananarivo's first LED advertising panels, which Rajoelina had installed at a major roundabout in the capital. In May 2007 he purchased the Ravinala television and radio stations, which he renamed Viva TV and Viva FM. The official launch of these newly acquired media channels on 27 May was attended by many of the capital's political and cultural elite, including Antananarivo mayor Hery Rafalimanana and Jacques Sylla, president of the TIM political party. Rajoelina used these media channels as outlets for voicing criticism of the Ravalomanana administration, quickly transforming his public image into that of an opposition leader.|$|E
5|$|The first {{permanent}} birth-control clinic {{was established}} in Britain in 1921 by Marie Stopes working with the Malthusian League. The clinic, run by midwives and supported by visiting doctors, offered women's birth-control advice and taught them {{the use of a}} cervical cap. Her clinic made contraception acceptable during the 1920s by presenting it in scientific terms. In 1921, Sanger founded the American Birth Control League, which later became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. In 1924 the Society for the Provision of Birth Control Clinics was founded to campaign for municipal clinics; this led to the opening of a second clinic in Greengate, Salford in 1926. Throughout the 1920s, Stopes and other feminist pioneers, including Dora Russell and Stella Browne, {{played a major role in}} breaking down taboos about sex. In April 1930 the Birth Control Conference assembled 700 delegates and was successful in bringing birth control and abortion <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> sphere – three months later, the Ministry of Health, in the United Kingdom, allowed local authorities to give birth-control advice in welfare centres.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} between 1993 till 1996, the Cambodian defence {{ministry}} attempted to integrate the different factions together, but were unsuccessful. In a dossier written by Nhek Bun Chhay around mid-1997, there were 80,800 pro-FUNCINPEC troops, which were divided into 11 battalions across the country. Nhek also express concern of the inferior troop strength of the pro-FUNCINPEC forces, as they were slightly outnumbered compared to 90,000 pro-CPP troops. In November 1996, armed skirmishes occurred between RCAF troops separately aligned to CPP and FUNCINPEC, after a pro-CPP general, Keo Pong accused a pro-FUNCINPEC general, Serey Kosal of attempting to kill him, who in turn accused Keo Pong of recruiting Khmer Rouge defectors into his ranks. More armed skirmishes broke out until February 1997, leaving 14 pro-CPP and 2 pro-FUNCINPEC troops wounded. Subsequently, Ke Kim Yan, the chief-of-staff of the RCAF stepped in to meditate the conflict, and a directive was issued to prohibit movement of troops without the explicit permission of the government. In late March 1997, the two co-defense ministers, Tea Banh of the CPP and Tea Chamrath of FUNCINPEC, together with Ke Kim Yan and Nhek Bun Chhay formed a bipartisan defence committee was formed to prevent the RCAF from getting embroiled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> conflict between Ranariddh and Hun Sen.|$|E
