Navarro was furious when confronted by Kiedis and Flea, but {{eventually}} accepted his termination. The Chili Peppers were fighting, and {{on the verge of}} breaking up. Flea was beginning to question the band's future and thought {{it may be necessary to}} break the band up. He made one last attempt to keep the band together, asking Frusciante to rejoin. Frusciante had recently completed a drug rehabilitation program after more than five years of heroin addiction, and gladly accepted the invitation.|$|E

Burnham returned to the Klondike having played no part in the war. Colonel Theodore Roosevelt regretted this as much as Burnham and paid him a great tribute in his book.|$|E

5|$|The British {{garrison}} at Diego Garcia {{had not yet}} {{learned of}} the state of war between Britain and Germany, and so treated Emden to a warm reception. She remained there until 10 October, during which time her bottom was cleaned of fouling. She then resumed searching for merchant ships in the area west of Colombo. While operating there, Emden picked up Hampshires wireless signals again, and so departed for the Chagos Archipelago on 13 October. Meanwhile, the British had captured Markomannia on 12 October, depriving Emden of one of her colliers. On 15 October, Emden captured a British steamer off Minikoi and sank her the next day. Over the next five days, she captured five more vessels; one was used as a collier, three were sunk, and the fifth was sent to port with the crews of the other vessels. On 20 October, Müller <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> move to a new area of operations.|$|E
5|$|Though he {{lost the}} 1976 Republican nomination, Ronald Reagan ran again for the {{presidency}} in 1980, and succeeded in winning the nomination and election. During this second campaign, Nancy played a very prominent role, and her management of staff became more apparent. She arranged a meeting among feuding campaign managers John Sears and Michael Deaver, and her husband, which resulted in Deaver leaving the campaign and Sears being given full control. After the Reagan camp lost the Iowa Caucus and fell behind in New Hampshire polls, Nancy organized a second meeting and <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> fire Sears and his associates; she gave Sears {{a copy of the}} press release announcing his dismissal. Her influence on her husband became particularly notable; her presence at rallies, luncheons, and receptions increased his confidence.|$|E

In 1996, the resort was purchased outright, for $43 million, due to the high success of the resort, although Disney still owns the land on which the resort sits.|$|E

25|$|LaSalle sales had {{consistently}} exceeded Cadillac's since 1933, so {{the question}} arises, why did GM decide to drop LaSalle? Evidently {{the lesson of the}} Packard One-Twenty had been weighing on the minds of the executives at GM. Since its introduction in 1935 the medium priced Packard One-Twenty had consistently outsold the LaSalle, with sales volume exceeding Cadillac's counterpart by an average of 72 percent over the six-year period 1935-40 inclusively. Since LaSalle had been a Cadillac in all but name for most of its lifespan, it was <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> bestow upon it the prestigious title of Cadillac.|$|E
25|$|In 1784, Zanet was lured onto an Ottoman {{ship and}} was given the choice of his life or to accept the title of bey and Ottoman vassalage. For four years since the last Ottoman invasion, Zanet had refused offers to become bey but under the {{pressure}} of this threat he accepted. But in 1798 he was caught conspiring with French agents. He was disposed and outlawed but he continued to cause trouble for the Ottomans from his fort at Cranae. In 1803, a load of French weapons was delivered to his fort.

25|$|Leading {{the way was}} Gary Wachs, son of Coney Island {{president}} Ralph Wachs, {{who with}} friends and family owned a majority of stock. He <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> relocate the park to stay competitive. After years of research and traveling abroad, he presented ideas for a new theme park to the company's board of directors. Some board members opposed relocating, including significant stockholder Charles Sawyer. It wasn't taken seriously until 1968, when actor Fess Parker announced plans to build a theme park in Northern Kentucky– well within Coney Island's primary market that extended as far south as Louisville. The announcement highlighted the need for change and gave Wachs' proposal credibility within the organization.|$|E
25|$|Charly García and Nito Mestre <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> quit Sui Generis, {{almost as}} if they felt the winds of change. And so their final two concerts at the Luna Park Arena took place on September 5 of that year, the most {{important}} acoustic rock band saying good-bye to 30,000 people. Historians have come to see the Sui Generis farewell concerts {{as the end of the}} 'Classic' Argentine rock era. Acoustic rock was passing into history: bands dissolved, changed their sound, and those that remained lost popularity and became only cult followings. Argentine progressive rock was on the rise, and so was the political repression to freedoms of expression. Also, several bands would leave the country for greener pastures in Europe, mostly Spain, among them Moris and Aquelarre.|$|E
25|$|The band quickly parted {{ways with}} Warner Bros. and <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> {{go back to}} basics. They {{concentrated}} {{on the strength of}} their live shows, and decided to release new recordings to independent labels instead of major companies. Over the next few years, Cheap Trick toured with several bands they had influenced, such as Stone Temple Pilots and Pearl Jam. At the end of 1995, the band independently released Gift, a two track Christmas CD that benefited Chicago-area charities. They spent the next year recording demos with Tom Werman and Steve Albini. They then released the 7inch vinyl single Baby Talk/Brontosaurus on Seattle-based indie label Sub Pop Records, which was produced by Albini. Now back on speaking terms with their former label, the band released Sex, America, Cheap Trick, a four disc box set that included dozens of rare and unreleased studio and live recordings along with some of the band's singles and favorites, on Epic Records.|$|E

25|$|General Morgan and his 2,460 handpicked Confederate cavalrymen, {{along with}} 4 {{artillery}} pieces, departed from Sparta, Tennessee, on June 11, 1863, intending {{to divert the}} attention of the Union Army of the Ohio from Southern forces in the state and possibly stir up pro-southern sentiments in the North. Gen. Braxton Bragg, the regional Confederate commander, had intended for Morgan's cavalrymen to provide a distraction by entering Kentucky. Morgan, however, confided to some of his officers that he had long desired to invade Indiana and Ohio to bring the terror of war to the North. Bragg had given him carte blanche to ride throughout Tennessee and Kentucky, but ordered him to under no circumstances cross the Ohio River. On June 23, the Federal Army of the Cumberland began its operations against General Bragg's Confederate Army of Tennessee in {{what became known as the}} Tullahoma Campaign, and Morgan <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> move northward into Kentucky.|$|E
25|$|Since Narioki and Zusho {{together}} ceased {{the flow}} of information regarding Satsuma’s officials or their dealings with Ryūkyū to Nariakira, Nariakira had to establish his own information-gathering network. He relied on Date Munenari of Uwajima to explain his predicament to the Tokugawa shogunate and Abe. He instructed his associates Yamaguchi Sadayasu and Shimazu Hisataka to gather information in Satsuma for him as well as keep a close watch on Zusho’s activities with special emphasis on goods and money being brought into the domain. Nariakira then <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> make his bid for the lordship of Satsuma. He relied on Date Munenari to report the situation for him and gain the sympathies of Abe. In a letter addressed to Date on August 27, 1848, Nariakira thanks him for obtaining Abe’s assurance that he would overlook Nairoki and Zusho’s transgressions and not take Satsuma to court as long as the Ryūkyū problem was resolved satisfactorily. Date’s correspondence with Abe served to hasten Narioki’s retirement and Nariakira’s ascendancy as daimyō of Satsuma.|$|E
25|$|By June 1898, {{the island}} of Luzon, except for Manila and the port of Cavite, was under Filipino control, after General Monet's retreat to Manila with his {{remaining}} force of 600 men and 80 wounded. The revolutionaries were laying siege to Manila and cutting off its food and water supply. With most of the archipelago under his control, Aguinaldo <b>decided</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> establish a Philippine government. When Aguinaldo arrived from Hong Kong, {{he brought with him}} a copy of a plan drawn by Mariano Ponce, calling {{for the establishment of a}} revolutionary government. Upon the advice of Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista, however, an autocratic regime was established on May 24, with Aguinaldo as dictator. It was under this dictatorship that independence was finally proclaimed on June 12, 1898, in Aguinaldo's house in Kawit, Cavite. The first Filipino flag was again unfurled and the national anthem was played for the first time. Apolinario Mabini, Aguinaldo's closest adviser, opposed Aguinaldo's decision to establish an autocracy. He instead urged Aguinaldo to create a revolutionary government. Aguinaldo refused to do so; however, Mabini was eventually able to convince him. Aguinaldo established a revolutionary government on July 23, 1898.|$|E
