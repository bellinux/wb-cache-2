40|$|Abstract. Extraction of {{castor oil}} is {{important}} in determination {{of the quality of}} castor oil extracted. The quality of castor oil being extracted has to meet the ASTM standard that has been produced. The way of extraction can be either mechanical extraction or chemical extraction that is practically used in the industry which give the highest yield of oil extracted. Castor oil is mainly composed of ricinoleic acid in high concentration. It is a unique vegetable oil that contains high content of <b>fatty</b> <b>hydroxyacid...</b>|$|E
40|$|Lipid tracers {{including}} <b>fatty</b> acids, <b>hydroxyacids,</b> n-alkanols, sterols and triterpenoids {{were used}} to determine the origin and fate of suspended particulate organic matter (POM) collected in the Rhône River (France). This seasonal survey (April 2011 to May 2013) revealed a year-round strong terrestrial higher-plant contribution to the particulate organic matter (POM), with significant algal inputs observed in March and attributed to phytoplanktonic blooms likely dominated by diatoms. Major terrigenous contributors to our samples are gymnosperms, and more precisely their roots and stems, as evidenced by the presence of high proportions of ω-hydroxydocosanoic acid (a suberin biomarker). The high amounts of coprostanol detected clearly show that the Rhône River is significantly affected by sewage waters. Specific sterol degradation products were quantified and used to assess the part of biotic and abiotic degradation of POM within the river. Higher-plant-derived organic matter appears to be mainly affected by photo-oxidation and autoxidation (free radical oxidation), while organic matter of mammal or human origin, evidenced by the presence of coprostanol, is clearly more prone to bacterial degradation. Despite the involvement of an intense autoxidation-inducing homolytic cleavage of peroxy bonds, a significant proportion of hydroperoxides is still intact in higher plant debris. These compounds could affect the degradation of terrestrial material by inducing an intense autoxidation upon its arrival at sea...|$|R
40|$|A {{photosynthetic}} bacterium isolated by enrichment {{on media}} containing formate as {{major source of}} cell carbon {{was identified as a}} strain of Rhodopseudomonas palustris. It grew {{on a wide range of}} simple organic compounds including alcohols, <b>fatty</b> acids, and <b>hydroxyacids,</b> on a chemically defined medium with biotin and p-aminobenzoic acid as essential growth factors. The organism grew on formate or photoautotrophically with molecular hydrogen or thiosulfate only in the presence of yeast extract. Ability to photoassimilate formate could be shown only in organisms grown in the presence of formate. The organism contained an inducible formic hydrogenlyase consisting of a soluble formic dehydrogenase, a particulate hydrogenase, and one or more intermediate, but as yet unidentified, electron carriers. The formic hydrogenlyase could be reconstituted from a particulate hydrogenase and a partially purified soluble formic dehydrogenase. Some properties of the formic dehydrogenase and hydrogenase have been compared with that of the formic hydrogenlyase system...|$|R
40|$|Poster E 1012 b presentado en el 27 th International Meeting on Organic Geochemistry September 13 – 18, 2015, Prague, Czech RepublicAmazonian {{ecosystems}} are considered important sinks for atmospheric CO 2 on Earth. It is therefore desirable {{to preserve their}} biodiversity and productivity. In this communication {{an assessment of the}} influence of different agro-forestry practices on soil C storage in representative ecosystems from the Peruvian Ucayali region is approached by analyzing the soil lipid fraction. In fact, this organic matter fraction is an important source of analytical surrogates of soil C stabilization and accumulation processes (Naafs at al., 2004; Poulenard et al., 2004; Rumpel et al., 2004). Top (0 – 20 cm) and subsoil (20 – 40 cm) samples were taken from the Amazonian Ucayali region (Pucallpa, Perú), ranging from recent alluvial soils in muddy zones of riverside areas (wetlands referred to as ‘mud’, ‘beach’ and low ‘restinga’ soils) to more developed soils located in medium and higher riverine terraces, as well as in hills. The lipid fraction was Soxhlet extracted with a mixture of ichloromethane:methanol (2 : 1 by vol.), saponified and divided into neutral and acid subfractions. The acid fractions were then sequentially methylated and silylated prior to the chromatographic analysis (González-Vila et al., 2003). Neutral and acid sub-fractions were separated and the major compounds were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry using an HP G 1800 A GCD System (electron impact detector at 70 eV) equipped with a DB- 5 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0. 32 mm i. d., film thickness 0. 25 µm) and using He as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1. 5 mL min- 1. The chromatographic oven temperature was programmed to increase from 40 to 100 ºC at 30 ºC min- 1 and then to 300 ºC at 6 ºC min - 1. The values of soil organic matter and lipids ranged from 25. 8 to 5. 8 g kg- 1, and from 5. 2 to 0. 2 g kg- 1, respectively. This variability as well as the differences in lipid molecular composition could suggest differences in the soils’ use and management practices (Van Bergen et al., 1996). The main families of signature lipids detected in the soil extracts were n-alkanes, linear isoprenoids, cyclic alkanes, n-fatty acids, branched fatty acids, unsaturated <b>fatty</b> acids, <b>hydroxyacids,</b> n-alcohols, ketones, polycyclic hydrocarbons and sterols. Very significant differences in qualitative and quantitative lipid composition were found in terms of soil depth. This effect was more pronounced in the soils from the riverine high terraces devoted to agro-forestry practices (Figs. 1 and 2). In addition, lipidic compounds of high molecular weight (i. e., di- and triterpenes) were detected as regular components of the free lipid fractions from the different ecosystems (wetlands, terraces and hills) reflecting specific vegetation and soil-use influences. Xenobiotic compounds (naphthenic acids) detected within the unresolved chromatographic ‘hump’ (highly unresolved mixture of cyclic or branched hydrocarbons) were also observed, indicating anthropogenic contamination by mineral oils. Likewise, dialkyl phthalates (Phth) from plasticizers were also detected. Projects CGL 2012 - 38655 -C 04 - 01 and CGL 2008 - 04296 and fellowship BES- 2013 - 062573 given to N. T. J.
