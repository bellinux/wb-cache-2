5|$|Haldane's {{hypothesis}} {{was that a}} diver could ascend immediately to a <b>depth</b> where the supersaturation reaches but does not exceed the critical supersaturation level, at which <b>depth</b> the pressure gradient for off-gassing is maximized and the decompression is most efficient. The diver would remain at this <b>depth</b> until saturation had reduced sufficiently for him to ascend another 10 feet, to the new <b>depth</b> of critical supersaturation, where the process would be repeated until it was safe for the diver to reach the surface. Haldane assumed a constant critical ratio of dissolved nitrogen pressure to ambient pressure which was invariant with <b>depth.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>depth</b> of {{the first}} stop is found from the tissue {{compartment}} with the highest partial pressure, and the <b>depth</b> of first decompression stop is the standard stop <b>depth</b> where this partial pressure is nearest without exceeding the critical pressure ratio.|$|E
5|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} successful decompression {{is that the}} <b>depth</b> and ascent rate of the diver must be monitored and sufficiently accurately controlled. Practical in-water decompression requires a reasonable tolerance for variation in <b>depth</b> and rate of ascent, but unless the decompression is being monitored in real time by a decompression computer, any deviations from the nominal profile will affect the risk. Several items of equipment are used to assist in facilitating accurate adherence to the planned profile, by allowing the diver to more easily control <b>depth</b> and ascent rate, or to transfer this control to specialist personnel at the surface.|$|E

The surfaces of the image are classified and their <b>depths</b> updated according to the <b>depths</b> of polylines forming the surfaces. The hidden lines are identified by comparing the <b>depths</b> of the polylines with the <b>depths</b> of the surfaces.

5|$|Ascent-induced hypoxia {{is caused}} by a drop in oxygen partial {{pressure}} as ambient pressure is reduced. The partial pressure of oxygen at <b>depth</b> may be sufficient to maintain consciousness but only at that <b>depth</b> and not at the reduced pressures nearer the surface.|$|E
5|$|At a {{barometric}} pressure of 218 atmospheres, the critical point {{of water is}} 375°C. At a <b>depth</b> of 3,000meters, the {{barometric pressure}} of sea water is more than 300atmospheres (as salt water is denser than fresh water). At this <b>depth</b> and pressure, seawater becomes supercritical at a temperature of 407°C (see image). However the increase in salinity at this <b>depth</b> pushes the water closer to its critical point. Thus, water emerging from the hottest parts of some hydrothermal vents, black smokers and submarine volcanoes can be a supercritical fluid, possessing physical properties between those of a gas and those of a liquid.|$|E
5|$|Contaminated {{breathing}} gas at <b>depth</b> can be fatal. Concentrations {{which are}} acceptable {{at the surface}} ambient pressure will be increased by the pressure of <b>depth</b> and may then exceed acceptable or tolerable limits. Common contaminants are: carbon monoxide - a by-product of combustion, carbon dioxide - a product of metabolism, and oil and lubricants from the compressor.|$|E

When the total optical <b>depths</b> measured through clouds were corrected for molecular scattering and gaseous absorption by subtracting the total optical <b>depths</b> measured through the background atmosphere, the resultant values are lower than those of the background aerosol at short wavelengths. The spectral dependence of these cloud optical <b>depths</b> is neutral, however, in contrast to that of the background aerosol or the molecular atmosphere...|$|R

This study investigated the potential of a real-time soil sensor (RTSS) for mapping six soil properties at multiple soil <b>depths</b> of a paddy field.

40|$|Mechanisms and <b>depths</b> of 40 {{earthquakes}} {{on major}} transforms along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge are studied {{in order to}} identify events that deviate from the transform-parallel strike-slip motion. Long and short period waves and Rayleigh wave spectral amplitudes are used to analyze focal mechanisms, <b>depths,</b> source time functions, and seismic moments of earthquakes. The relationship between centroid <b>depths</b> and transform thermal structures is examined. The data reveal that transform earthquake centroid <b>depths</b> occur above the predicted 400 C isotherms and the oceanic intraplate <b>depths</b> extend to the 750 C isotherm. Slip rates inferred from seismic moment releases are compared to those predicted by plate motions and good correlation is detected.

5|$|It {{is largely}} an {{empirical}} procedure, {{and has a}} reasonable safety record {{within the scope of}} its intended application. Advantages are reduced overall decompression time and for some versions, easy estimation of decompression by the use of a simple rule-based procedure which can be done underwater by the diver. It requires the use of specific gas mixtures for given <b>depth</b> ranges. The advantages claimed are flexibility in that if the <b>depth</b> is not known accurately, the schedule can be adjusted during the dive to allow for the actual <b>depth,</b> and that it allows deep dives without the use of an expensive trimix dive computer.|$|E
5|$|PDISs are {{intermediate}} {{stops at}} a <b>depth</b> above the <b>depth</b> at which the leading compartment for the decompression calculation switches from ongassing to offgassing and below the <b>depth</b> of the first obligatory decompression stop, (or the surface, on a no-decompression dive). The ambient pressure at that <b>depth</b> is low enough {{to ensure that the}} tissues are mostly offgassing inert gas, although under a very small pressure gradient. This combination is expected to inhibit bubble growth. The leading compartment is generally not the fastest compartment except in very short dives, for which this model does not require an intermediate stop.|$|E
5|$|Some {{types of}} dive profile have been named. An {{analysis}} of dive profiles logged by dive computers by the Divers Alert Network used categorization rules which {{were based on}} the fraction of the dive time spent in four <b>depth</b> zones: descent, bottom, multilevel, and decompression. The descent zone was defined as the part of the dive between the surface and first reaching 85% of the maximum <b>depth.</b> The bottom zone is the part of the dive deeper than 85% of maximum <b>depth.</b> The multilevel zone is ascent from 85% to 25% of maximum <b>depth,</b> and the decompression zone is less than 25% of maximum cepth. A square dive was defined as having more than 40% of the total dive time in the bottom zone and not more than 30% in the multilevel and decompression zones. A multilevel was defined as having at least 40% of the total dive time in the multilevel zone. All other dives are considered to be intermediate.|$|E
