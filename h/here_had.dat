5|$|Gauze is {{reputed to}} have {{originated}} in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza thob was often woven at nearby Majdal (Ascalon). Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric {{that had been}} made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. Thobs <b>here</b> <b>had</b> narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye.|$|E
5|$|Homdong Khangtsang, also spelt ‘Kamcuns’ in Tibetan language, are {{the main}} {{dwelling}} units or dormitories which house the monks of the monastery; there are thirty-three Kamcuns surrounding the central courtyard. The size of the Kamcuns varied, depending {{on the strength of}} monks housed. Monks of the same village are housed together; however each monk is given a separate cell. Each Kamcun also has a prayer hall for exclusive study of Buddhist doctrine and also has annexed tea house. However, the main assembly hall <b>here</b> <b>had</b> minor images of Tsongkhapa, Choyi Gyeltsen, Shakhyamuni Buddha, Three Deities of Longevity, and two inner chapels – the Jampakhang with ‘speaking’ image of Tara (protector of the springs in Sera) and Lama Tubten Kunga (who renovated Sera Me) and Gonkhang chapel with the image of the protector deity Gyelchen Karma Trinle.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also brought}} out, {{for the first}} time, the burial customs of the Neolithic people. Both human and animal skeletons were found in deep oval shaped pits, located either below the floors of the {{dwelling}} units or in its precincts. These pits were filled with ash, stones and potsherds. Some of the human skulls found <b>here</b> <b>had</b> trepanning (bored hole) marks. In many pits, bones of dogs and antlered deer were found along with human skeletons. The skeletons of humans {{were found in the}} burial pits in a sitting position along with bones of animals.|$|E

5|$|The Bristol and Exeter Railway amalgamated {{with the}} GWR on 1 January 1876. It {{had already made}} a start on mixing the gauge on its line, a task {{completed}} through to Exeter on 1 March 1876 by the GWR. The station <b>here</b> <b>had</b> been shared with the LSWR since 1862. This rival company had continued to push westwards over its Exeter and Crediton line and arrived in Plymouth later in 1876, which spurred the South Devon Railway to also amalgamate with the Great Western. The Cornwall Railway remained a nominally independent line until 1889, although the GWR held {{a large number of}} shares in the company. One final new broad-gauge route was opened on 1 June 1877, the St Ives branch in west Cornwall, although there was also a small extension at Sutton Harbour in Plymouth in 1879. Part of a mixed gauge point remains at Sutton Harbour, one of the few examples of broad gauge trackwork remaining in situ anywhere.|$|E

From 1906 to 1947 the United States Smelting, Refining and Mining Company {{was the primary}} producer here, with output reaching its peak in the 1930s. However, by 1947, mining <b>here</b> <b>had</b> become too costly, because of political instability, labor disputes and low prices for silver on the world market. The company sold its interests to the Mexican government in 1965.|$|E

25|$|Observers at {{the time}} did not {{consider}} the battle's outcome as a defeat, as it is widely considered today. <b>Here</b> <b>had</b> been wise initiative and energy, which just is, which is expected in war. Julius Strandberg wrote a broadside, in which the good commander was praised in a way, so {{it is difficult to}} see through that Denmark actually lost. Beck was subsequently appointed as Colonel and Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{a system}} of one star {{designation}} was adopted for use. This system is intended {{to take into account}} not only Bundesliga titles but also other (now defunct) national championships. As of July 2014, the following clubs are allowed to wear one star while playing outside the Bundesliga. The number in parentheses is for total league championships won over the course of German football history, and would be displayed within the star. Some teams listed <b>here</b> <b>had</b> different names while winning their respective championships, these names are also noted in parentheses.|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} that packaging {{for many of the}} promotional offerings was identical to that of other diecast manufacturers. For example, the Mercedes Unimog (shown <b>here)</b> <b>had</b> an identical silver black-lined box design to that of the NZG Mercedes Coupe. The only difference is the precise box size and the color of the lettering stating what vehicle came inside. This is evidence of the control of the client over many promotional companies and their offerings. Obviously, Mercedes wanted a particular appearance for its packaged products and required that across multiple providers.|$|E

25|$|The 'Age of Totalitarianism' {{included}} {{nearly all}} of the infamous examples of genocide in modern history, headed by the Jewish Holocaust, but also comprising the mass murders and purges of the Communist world, other mass killings carried out by Nazi Germany and its allies, and also the Armenian Genocide of 1915. All these slaughters, it is argued <b>here,</b> <b>had</b> a common origin, the collapse of the elite structure and normal modes of government of much of central, eastern and southern Europe as a result of World War I, without which surely neither Communism nor Fascism would have existed except in the minds of unknown agitators and crackpots.|$|E
25|$|Feste {{was almost}} {{certainly}} written for Armin, as he is a scholar, a singer, and a wit. Feste's purpose is to reveal the foolishness of those around him. Lear's fool differs from both Touchstone and Feste {{as well as from}} other clowns of his era. Touchstone and Feste are philosopher-fools; Lear's fool is the natural fool of whom Armin studied and wrote. Armin <b>here</b> <b>had</b> the opportunity to display his studies. The fool speaks the prophecy lines, which he tells—largely ignored—to Lear before disappearing from the play altogether. Lear's fool is hardly around for entertainment purposes; rather, he is present to forward the plot, remain loyal to the king, and perhaps to stall his madness.|$|E
25|$|The Bucs {{went to the}} Georgia Dome for a Week 2 contest {{against their}} {{division}} rival, the Atlanta Falcons. Historically, the Buccaneers {{had been able to}} effectively contain Falcons' QB Michael Vick, shutting down the Falcons' offense in the process. However, the Bucs' performance <b>here</b> <b>had</b> not improved much from Week 1. The defense was unable to stop the running duo of Vick and RB Warrick Dunn, whose combined performance netted 261 yards, and 306 for Atlanta as a team—a new Falcons team record. Also illustrating their sharp fall in performance from their #1 NFL ranking the previous season, the Bucs' defense also allowed a 1-yard QB TD run by Vick and a 4-yard TD pass to RB Fred McCrary. Bucs QB Chris Simms continued to struggle, throwing another three interceptions, while Carnell Williams was held to just 37 yards on 15 carries. The Bucs' only points came on a chip-shot 22-yard field goal by kicker Matt Bryant.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after its}} foundation, Puebla {{was well known}} for its fine ceramics, {{especially}} for the style that would be called Talavera. This has been due to the abundance of quality clay in the region, drawing {{some of the best}} artisans. Between 1550 and 1570, Spanish potters from Talavera de la Reina in Spain came to Puebla to teach the locals European techniques of using the potter’s wheel and tin-glazing. These new methods were mixed with native designs to give rise to what became known as Poblano Talavera. The glazing technique was first used for the tiles that still decorate many of the buildings in this city. Later, it was used to make pots, plates, jars, religious figures and other items. By the mid-17th century, the industry <b>here</b> <b>had</b> become well-established. Guilds were formed and ordinances passed to ensure quality. Blue was used only on the most expensive pieces due to the cost of the mineral used to produce it. The period between 1650 and 1750 was known as the Golden Age.|$|E
25|$|Alwar is {{the first}} major city when {{travelling}} from Delhi en route to Rajasthan. Its heritage is a major draw for tourists. The fort of Alwar, known as Bala fort, is about 595 meters high. It was constructed in the tenth century, making it the oldest building in the city. Despite {{being one of the}} princely states of Rajputana, the rulers <b>here</b> <b>had</b> left no stone unturned in building many forts. Seeing the fort of Baala, there is an impression that sometimes {{it would have been a}} very inaccessible fort, where there would have been many turrets, a large gate, a temple and a residential area. There is a state museum in the City Palace, where there is a rare collection of miniature paintings. Near the corner are Mousi's umbrella, Vinay Palace, Vijay Mandir Palace and Moti Dungri. In other tourist spots, the lake is situated in Silasedh Lake and Jaisamand Lake. Sariska, which is at a distance of 36 kilometers, after rain, for its green trees and greenery of bushes, is seen differently. In its beautiful valley, visions are visible with blue cow, chital, wild pig, other animals. Sariska is counted in old Tiger-projects. Due to poaching sighting tigers has unfortunately become rare. Do not be discouraged but go Sariska, which is still full of beautiful natural scenery and colorful birds. Historical significance of the nearby Biratnagar or Barrath, is due to the stupa and established inscription made by Emperor Ashoka the Great. According to legendary belief, Pandavas spent some time in their ignorance here. There is a large number of religious devotees on the Pandupole-Bhardhari Loktirtha. You can also experience unlimited peace by traveling here. Alwar is also famous for its famous sweet kalakand (Mauva of Alwar), this milk made from milk is not only nearby but also famous. The items made of paper-potter are also very much appreciated here.|$|E
500|$|During {{negotiations}} of the treaty, Americans {{had failed}} to secure the right of transit across the [...] Isthmus of Tehuantepec in southern Mexico. [...] The idea of building a railroad <b>here</b> <b>had</b> been considered for a long time. In 1842 Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna sold the rights to build a railroad or canal across the isthmus. The deal included land grants -wide along the right-of-way for future colonization and development. In 1847 a British bank bought the rights, raising U.S. fears of British colonization in the hemisphere, {{in violation of the}} precepts of the Monroe Doctrine. United States interest in the right-of-way increased in 1848 after the gold strikes in the Sierra Nevada, which led to the California Gold Rush.|$|E

500|$|Ani's {{long-term}} decline {{began in}} 1239 when Mongols sacked {{the city and}} massacred its population. In 1319 a devastating earthquake struck Ani. It resulted {{in the collapse of}} the cathedral's conical roof. Ani was completely deserted by the 18th century. The drum reportedly collapsed during an 1832 or 1840 earthquake. The north-western corner of the cathedral was heavily damaged by a 1988 earthquake with its epicenter in modern Armenia's north. It resulted in a large gaping hole. According to VirtualAni it also caused [...] "a serious rent in the south-west corner; by 1998 parts of the roof <b>here</b> <b>had</b> started to fall." [...] Lavrenti Barseghian wrote in 2003 that the damage from the earthquake was so great that the entire building would collapse unless strengthened and restored.|$|E

500|$|Zaion: I Wish You Were <b>Here</b> <b>had</b> a mixed reception. Patrick king of Anime Fringe wrote, [...] "On the surface, it {{may appear}} to be merely another sci-fi mecha action show. However, Zaion {{introduced}} apocalyptic themes similar to those found in Michael Crichton's novel Andromeda Strain and the film 28 Days Later". According to King, the real story of Zaion occurs when Yuuji and Ai develop their relationship, and [...] "we begin to think less of the nanomachine technology and viral invasion of the planet and focus more upon the potential love between these two lonely people, trapped in a labyrinth devoid of an exit". The series was produced with high audio and visual qualities, and was designed with [...] "plausible technical details". King also praised the fitting soundtrack, which was composed by Kenji Kawai and incorporated the sounds of progressive rock.|$|E
