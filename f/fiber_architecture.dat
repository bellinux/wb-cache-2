An algorithm based on principal components analysis filtering and temporal maximum intensity projection (PCATMIP) is used to compensate for motion-induced signal loss.

Finally, to assess cardiac motion effects on in vivo <b>fiber</b> <b>architecture,</b> in vivo cardiac DTI data processed by PCATMIP are compared to those obtained from one trigger delay (TD) or one single phase acquisition.

To {{deal with the}} leakage of flow when the Lagrangian mesh becomes coarser than the fluid mesh, we employ adaptive interaction quadrature points for Lagrangian-Eulerian interaction equations based on a previous work. In particular, we introduce a new anisotropic adaptive interaction quadrature rule. The new rule permits us to vary the interaction quadrature points not only at each time-step and element but also at different orientations per element. For the material model, we extend our previous fiber-based model to a continuum-based model. We first study {{a case in which}} a three-dimensional short tube is dilated. Results match very well with those from the implicit FE method. We remark that in our IB-FE case, the three-dimensional tube undergoes a very large deformation and the Lagrangian mesh-size becomes about 6 times of Eulerian mesh-size. To validate the method in handling fiber-matrix material models, we perform a second study on dilating a long fiber-reinforced tube. Errors are small when we compare numerical solutions with analytical solutions. The technique is then applied to the problem of esophageal transport. We present three cases that differ in the material model and muscle <b>fiber</b> <b>architecture.</b> The overall transport features are consistent with those from the previous model.
