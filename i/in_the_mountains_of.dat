5|$|Delichon is an Old World genus {{with all}} three species {{breeding}} only in the Northern Hemisphere. The common house martin is a widespread migrant breeder across Europe, north Africa and all northern temperate Asia to Kamchatka. Its western subspecies D.u.urbicum winters in tropical Africa, and eastern D.u.lagopodum moves to southern China and Southeast Asia. The Asian house martin breeds further south than common house martin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>of</b> central and eastern Asia; its nominate subspecies winters in Southeast Asia, but the races breeding in the Himalayan and Taiwan may just move from the high mountains to lower altitudes. The Nepal house martin is resident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>of</b> southern Asia.|$|E

5|$|Beginning around September10, heavy {{rainfall}} occurred sporadically in southern Mexico and into Central America, {{influenced by a}} broader storm system related to Hurricane Floyd. Toward the end of September, {{heavy rainfall}} occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>of</b> northeastern Mexico, which prompted officials to open flood gates. The rains occurred throughout Mexico {{for about two weeks}} before the worst of the precipitation began, and saturated soils before the heaviest rainfall in October.|$|E
5|$|Choughs can be locally {{threatened}} by the accumulation of pesticides and heavy metals in the mountain soils, heavy rain, shooting and other human disturbances, but a longer-term threat comes from global warming, which would cause the species' preferred Alpine climate zone to shift to higher, more restricted areas, or locally to disappear entirely. Fossils of both chough species were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>of</b> the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands {{may have been due}} to climate change or human activity.|$|E

50|$|Paul of Tammah {{lived as}} a hermit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>of</b> Ansena (currently <b>in</b> <b>the</b> El Minya {{governorate}} of Egypt). He had a disciple named Ezekiel.

5|$|For two years, Bahá'u'lláh {{lived alone}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>of</b> Kurdistan. He {{originally}} lived as a hermit, {{dressed like a}} dervish and used the name Darvish Muhammad-i-Irani. At one point someone noticed his penmanship, which brought the curiosity of the instructors of the local Sufi orders. As he began to take guests, he became noted for his learning and wisdom. Shaykh `Uthmán, Shaykh `Abdu'r-Rahmán, and Shaykh Ismá'íl, leaders of the Naqshbandíyyih, Qádiríyyih, and Khálidíyyih Orders respectively, began to seek his advice. It was to the second of these that the Four Valleys was written. Bahá'u'lláh wrote several other notable books during this time.|$|E
5|$|Granite {{intrusions}} {{are found}} in the parish of Barvas in west Lewis, and another forms the summit plateau of the mountain Roineabhal in Harris. The granite here is anorthosite, and is similar in composition to rocks found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>of</b> the Moon. There are relatively small outcrops of Triassic sandstone at Broad Bay near Stornoway. The Shiant Isles and St Kilda are formed from much later tertiary basalt and basalt and gabbros respectively. The sandstone at Broad Bay was once thought to be Torridonian or Old Red Sandstone.|$|E
5|$|In Spain, the red-billed chough has {{recently}} expanded its range by utilising old buildings, with 1,175 breeding pairs in a mi) study area. These new breeding areas usually surround the original montane core areas. However, the populations with nest sites on buildings {{are threatened by}} human disturbance, persecution {{and the loss of}} old buildings. Fossils of both chough species were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>of</b> the Canary Islands. The local extinction of the Alpine chough and the reduced range of red-billed chough in the islands may have been due to climate change or human activity.|$|E

5|$|Members of the {{nuthatch}} family live {{in most of}} North America and Europe {{and throughout}} Asia down to the Wallace Line. Nuthatches are sparsely represented in Africa; one species lives in a small area of northeastern Algeria and a population of the Eurasian nuthatch subspecies, S. e. hispaniensis, lives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>of</b> Morocco. Most species are resident year-round. The only significant migrant is the red-breasted nuthatch, which winters widely across North America, deserting the northernmost parts of its breeding range in Canada; it has been recorded as a vagrant in Bermuda, Iceland and England.|$|E
5|$|One {{person was}} killed and another was injured in Taipei after a 20m (65ft) high {{scaffolding}} in a construction site collapsed. At least 495mm (19in) of rain fell <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>of</b> Taiwan, triggering flooding which damaged about 24hectares of crops, leaving NT$7.8million (US$236,300) in losses. A total of 8,795 residences were left without power {{at the height of}} the storm. Several roads and bridges were also washed out from flooding. Officials in Taiwan recorded 29 landslides, mostly in northern areas, and urged residents to evacuate due to the possibility of more.|$|E

5|$|Romblon's {{aboriginal}} inhabitants {{were the}} Negritos from Panay and Mangyans from Mindoro, who {{settled in the}} islands during the precolonial period. Ancient wooden coffins discovered in the Guyangan Cave System of Banton Island in 1936 signify a rich ancient civilization and culture in the province {{before the arrival of}} the Spaniards in 1569. These artifacts are currently on display at the National Museum in Manila. Remnants of Negrito and Mangyan aborigines now live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> <b>of</b> Tablas and Sibuyan after they were displaced by the influx of Hiligaynon, Aklanon, Bicolano and Tagalog migrants as early as 1870.|$|E
