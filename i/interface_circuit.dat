40|$|Abstract—Several complex {{electrostatic}} discharge (ESD) failure mechanisms {{have been found}} in the <b>interface</b> <b>circuits</b> of an IC product with multiple separated power domains. In this case, the machine-model (MM) ESD robustness cannot achieve 150 V in this IC product with separated power domains, although it can pass the 2 -kV human-body-model (HBM) ESD test. The nega-tive-to-VDD (ND) mode MM ESD currents were discharged by circuitous current paths through <b>interface</b> <b>circuits</b> to cause the gate oxide damage, the junction filament, and the contact destruc-tion of the internal transistors. The detailed discharging paths of ND-mode ESD failures were analyzed in this paper. In addition, some ESD protection designs have been illustrated and reviewed to further comprehend the protection strategies for cross-power-domain ESD events. Moreover, one new active ESD protection design for the <b>interface</b> <b>circuits</b> between separated power domains has been proposed and successfully verified in a 0. 13 -µm CMOS technology.

40|$|Abstract: Electrostatic {{discharge}} (ESD) protection {{has been}} a very important reliability issue in microelectronics, especially for integrated circuits (ICs).
