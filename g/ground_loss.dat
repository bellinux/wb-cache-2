40|$|Abstract. Under the {{particular}} geological conditions of clay and sandy soil interbed, through numerical analysis and field monitoring, the surface settlement, horizontal deformation and the stress distribution were analyzed after the tunnel excavation in a metro station in Beijing, China. There are differences of surface deformation whether the backfill grouting behind arch during tunnel excavation. While the backfill grouting behind arch, the ground surface settlement and the horizontal displacement reach 9. 36 mm and 2. 16 mm respectively. But while no backfill grouting behind arch, the ground surface settlement and the horizontal displacement are 14. 51 mm and 8. 85 mm respectively.

Safety risk control requires a comprehensive analysis of instrumentation data integrated with other safety related data.

As {{one of the most}} important safety indicators, ground settlement is analyzed to take advantage of the data warehouse. A double Gaussian model is proposed to represent the settlement trough over twin tunnels. Moreover, a revised trough width parameter is proposed to represent the scope of safety risk areas. The <b>ground</b> <b>loss</b> is found to grow in a pattern that can be represented by a logistic curve.

40|$|Tunneling inevitably {{leads to}} ground {{settlement}}. The ground settlement trough over a single tunnel is well {{described by the}} generally accepted Peck’s formula. A new model of settlement trough is proposed by extending Peck’s formula {{to the case of}} horizontally aligned twin tunnels, which is a widely used tunnel configuration in urban metro projects. The feasibility of the new model is demonstrated through exploration of a large amount of ground settlement data accumulated from a metro tunnel project in China. Two numerical methods are implemented in the data exploration process {{to solve the problem of}} non-linear curve-fitting and estimation of model parameters. The Levenberg–Marquardt method is shown to be more suitable than the Nelder–Mead method. Based on the new model of settlement trough, a new method for calculating <b>ground</b> <b>loss</b> over twin tunnels is also proposed. The concluded empirical value of the ratio of <b>ground</b> <b>loss</b> is considered to provide an excellent reference for similar urban railway projects in the future...|$|E

40|$|The {{strawberry}} crop shares {{some problems}} resulting from being horticultural crop cultivated on modelled and mulched lands, with narrow planting layouts, which reduce {{the types of}} machines available: hand held equipment (spray guns, spray booms, etc), or “cannon” distribution system. These sprayers produce both qualitative (uniform distribution of pesticide on and within the vegetation, <b>ground</b> <b>losses)</b> and quantitative (volume/ha; timeliness) problems. The aim {{of this paper is}} focused on the results of simulated treatment tests carried out in tunnels on strawberry crops with follow up analysis of the leaf deposits made using colorimetric techniques. Tests were made using the following hand held equipment: spray gun and two nozzle boom, connected with a hose to an hydraulic sprayer; furthermore an air assisted sprayer equipped with tangential cannon was used. Relating to hand held equipment, leaf deposits result from: a) the equipment characteristics and its positioning relative to target; b) operator velocity exchange during the treatment; c) position of the sampled leaves. Relating to cannon sprayers, leaf deposits show low capacity of penetration of the spray inside the vegetation and the need to adjust the length of the tunnel to the spray range. Finally, the <b>ground</b> <b>losses</b> are always higher than the leaf deposits, also in the case of localized treatments (carried out with the spray gun and the boom segment) owing to excess volumes/ha as regards to the effective needs of the cultivation...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} results of some spray {{application}} trials carried out in two tomato greenhouses to assess foliar deposition, <b>ground</b> <b>losses,</b> and dermal operator exposure when using hand-held highpressure spray lances. Two operating ways (forward vs. backwards operator movement) and two different plant vegetative stages (pre-production vs. full development) were taken into consideration. An experimental design with one factor (the operator walking direction) was adopted, arranged according to a randomised block design with three replicates. Volume application rates were settled according to the plant development: 900 L/ha in pre-production stage and 1800 L/ha at full development stage. The results showed {{no statistically significant differences}} in the mean foliar deposition between the two walking directions in both development stages. The greatest differences among the sampling locations were observed in pre-production stage, when, due to the spraying technique (spray jet directed from top to bottom), the foliar deposits in the low part of the canopy were much lower than those in the middle and high part. Also <b>ground</b> <b>losses</b> were unaffected by walking direction: they ranged on average from 14. 3 % to 23. 5 % of the applied volume rate. Finally, the dermal operator exposure was greatly affected by walking direction: at full development stage, it was 8 times higher walking forward than walking backwards. So, this simple change in field practice can noticeably improve the operator safety, without penalising working capacity and quality of deposition...|$|R
40|$|The <b>ground</b> <b>loss</b> problem {{occurs when}} a {{cylindrical}} tunnel is constructed in a soil with the radius of the tunnel being somewhat smaller than the radius of the cavity. The method used in this paper is Muskhelishvilli's complex variable method considering conformal mapping of the elastic region onto a circular ring. The problem of an elastic half plane with a circular cavity was investigated, regarding the case that along the boundary of the cavity, the surface tractions were prescribed. The computer program (<b>ground</b> <b>loss)</b> was used. The program worked interactively, {{on the basis of}} values of Poisson's ratio and the ratio of the radius of the cavity to its depth (r/h). It was investigated whether certain problems of stresses and deformations caused by deformation of a tunnel in an elastic half plane could be solved by the complex variable method. For this purpose, two elementary boundary value problems were considered in detail. These include the problem of a half plane with a circular cavity loaded by a uniform radial stress, and the problem in which a uniform radial displacement is imposed on the cavity boundary (this is usually called the <b>ground</b> <b>loss</b> problem). It was concluded that the displacement of the bottom of the tunnel was always smaller than the value, u(o) (the displacement of the cavity). For large values of r/h, the displacement may even be negative, that is, downward. The displacement of the bottom was always equal to the average displacement of the tunnel plus a constant value Mo which is the imposed radial displacement...|$|E
