40|$|ABSTRACT Little {{is known}} about the extent of {{disabled}} people’s exclusion from the <b>owner</b> <b>occupation</b> market. The focus of this research was to consider how disabled potential owner occupiers experience exclusion at the point of the sales rooms and viewing properties. A multiple case study was undertaken with eleven disabled people who had experience of accessing the <b>owner</b> <b>occupation</b> market. Analysis reveals that disabled people with mobility impairments encounter barriers which are physical, attitudinal and systemic. Conclusions are reached that disabled people meet barriers at the initial stages of buying a home because they are not taken into account in the design stage. Certain key changes in the design of homes for <b>owner</b> <b>occupation</b> are required <b>in</b> order for people with physical impairments to approximate equal terms with other customers <b>in</b> the <b>owner</b> <b>occupation</b> market.

40|$|Whilst the {{universal}} growth of home ownership in most advanced industrial countries attracts much attention <b>in</b> housing studies, <b>owner</b> <b>occupation</b> <b>in</b> multi-family housing, {{which is a}} dominant form of home ownership in many large cities particularly in Asia, is largely underresearched. In fact, such tenure form is arguably more complicated {{in terms of the}} social relation in housing as well as having a significant impact on how management in housing is organized viz-a-viz its counterparts in single family housing. This paper attempts to compare the tenant co-operative housing in Sweden and the condominiums in Hong Kong, both of which are popular tenure for multi-family <b>owner</b> <b>occupation</b> housing <b>in</b> the two places. The paper argues that whilst ideological hegemony is the driving force for the monopoly of tenant ownership in Sweden, it is sheer market force and the monopolistic power of real property developers in Hong Kong which construct the dominance of condominium in Hong Kong. On the other hand, housing co-operative and condominium as different organizational arrangements of housing management is also revealing. It indicates that whilst tenant ownership comes closer to condominium in terms of property right, condominium has something to learn from co-operatives in the area of housing management...|$|R
40|$|Home {{ownership}} {{is an important}} asset, and is linked to ownership of other forms of wealth. First entry to home {{ownership is}} therefore an interesting indicator of likely lifetime circumstances. This paper uses data from the British Household Panel Study to examine the pattern of first entry into owner-occupation {{of young people in}} Great Britain in the 1990 s. In particular we are interested in the degree to which social inequality has a bearing on the rate of entry, but also in patterns of age, sex, education, employment, family formation and spouse’s characteristics. We look at people who are observed for at least two consecutive years of the BHPS (1991 – 1998), who are under 24 when first observed, and who are not yet <b>in</b> <b>owner</b> <b>occupation,</b> and trace them forward to see if they become home owners. We find strong associations between the year-on-year rate of entry and a number of independent variables. Half of all entrants were living with their parents the year before, one third in private rental. Over half of all who marry in the year als...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare the level, {{composition}} {{and distribution of}} household wealth in five industrial countries: the UK, US, Italy, Finland and Sweden. We exploit the harmonized data within the Luxembourg Wealth Study, which we have extended {{to allow us to}} examine trends in the UK and the US between the mid- 1990 s and the mid- 2000 s. Remaining differences between surveys, variable definitions and coverage are highlighted {{to the extent that they}} impact on cross-country comparisons. We find that the Nordic countries have lower average wealth holdings, smaller absolute gaps between low wealth and high wealth households but high relative measures of wealth inequality. Italian households hold very little debt and are much more likely to own their homes outright, leading to relatively high median levels of wealth. In contrast American households tend to hold much more housing debt well into retirement. Increases <b>in</b> <b>owner</b> <b>occupation</b> and house prices 2000 - 05 in the UK has led to substantial increases in wealth, particularly median wealth holdings and this had led to falls in relative measures of wealth inequality such as the Gini coefficient even though absolute gaps between high and low wealth households have grown substantially. We show that there are underlying country differences in terms of distributions of age, household composition, educational attainment and income as well as wealth and debt portfolios. Educational loans are increasing in their size and prevalence in some countries and look set to create some marked differences in the distribution of wealth for different age cohorts...|$|E
40|$|We {{model the}} hazard of first entry to owner occupation, using a {{sub-sample}} of the British Household Panel Study consisting {{of young adults}} not yet <b>in</b> <b>owner</b> <b>occupation.</b> Our interest is to assess {{the importance of social}} inequality, measured as socio-economic class using the new ONS-SEC, while taking account of the direct effects of age, household formation, education and labour market situation of the individual (and his/her spouse, where appropriate). Socio-economic class has a very strong bivariate effect but this persists, with some modification, into the multivariate analysis. Higher professionals and managers have by far the highest rate of entry, with the unemployed and students having the lowest, even when controlling for income, education, employment status, age, gender and household formation, all of which have strong effects of their own. On a smaller sample we investigate some effects of class of origin, and of spouse's class but with few significant effects. Some features of this modelling lead us to speculate that access to social housing, as a competing destination, may be patterning entry to owner occupation. The class gradient may reflect as much the compensatory effects of state provision as market-related advantages. Also, the effect of childen on entry to owner occupation is strongly negative. We investigate this by fitting parallel models on the rate of entry to social housing, and find that this seems to be the case: while the age and partnership effects are very similar, the class effect is reversed (except for students, whose low rate of entry to ownership is not associated with disadvantage) and the effect of children is strong and positive. ...|$|E

The house and demesne were <b>in</b> the <b>owner's</b> <b>occupation</b> and the remaining lands occupied by one tenant, with both leases to expire following the sale. The lands were said to produce an annual profit of £221 16s. 7d., with the demesne containing mature timber, excellent lands suitable for pasture and tillage, and an abundant supply of water. The house had also recently been repaired. On 16 May 1856, a Memorandum of Agreement was noted between Thomas Stephen Coppinger and John Galwey of Fort Richard, Co Cork, affecting the lands of Oughteherrybeg, Carhue, Coultimorroghue and Keelteenagh, which were subsequently granted by the Commissioners to Thomas Stephen Coppinger by Deed of Conveyance dated 5 July 1856, in consideration of £5,525 being paid into the Bank of Ireland to the credit of the Estate of Henry Thorne Coppinger. In consideration of £3,000, John Galwey then released a charge over the lands by Deed of Release dated 26 July 1856. Thomas Stephen Coppinger then disposed of his interest in Carhue and other lands to George Charles Edward Colthurst of Dripsey Castle by Deed of Conveyance dated 14 August 1856, in consideration of payment of £6,750. On the same day, Colthurst by Deed of Mortgage and in consideration of £2,300 disposed of lands (including Carhue) to Peggy Colthurst of Dripsey Castle.|$|R
40|$|Two {{specific}} shifts {{have occurred}} in the sectoral bases of welfare provision in the UK since the last war. The first involved in establishment of collective state provision whilst the second has involved a significant expansion of <b>owner</b> <b>occupation.</b> These developments have been interpreted at various times as signifying substantial changes in the nature of British society, particularly {{in the way that they}} are alleged to have attenuated class based social divisions and patterns of consciousness. <b>In</b> contemporary debates, <b>owner</b> <b>occupation</b> is alleged to have generated a conservative domestic oriented attitudinal disposition among manual households. Further, such households are held to be profoundly disaffected from state welfare as a result of their experiences as clients in this sector. The Plymouth study, which is reported below, was concerned with public attitudes to welfare. More specifically, its aim was to generate a data base which would enable the relative significance of sectoral patterns of welfare and household class as factors which influence the pattern of public attitudes to issues in social policy to be assessed. This aim was implemented by administering a structured questionnaire to a sample of 150 households in Plymouth. Subsequent empirical and conceptual analyses generated three conclusions. First, people are dissatisfied with the experience of state welfare but it is the distributive impact of welfare which is of the greatest significance in the calculations of the average household. Second, sectoral patterns of welfare do influence public perceptions of issues in social policy, but in a modest and specific way. Third, household class remains the most significant determinant of access to welfare, public or private, and because of this, the most significant influence on the pattern of public attitudes to welfare...|$|R
40|$|Since World War II, {{housing in}} Britain {{has become a}} {{politically}} contentious issue. The quality of housing is often considered to be indicative of a nation's social development. The media have broadcast the shortcomings of various policies: housing has become an emotive concept. This study shows how changing philosophies have affected the housing market and consequently the relative proportion of tenancies. Three political parties now favour owner occupation as the major form of tenancy; {{in many parts of}} Britain it has become a normative behaviour pattern. Several researchers have suggested that housing is symbolic of man's social aspirations. It is thought to be associated with social status and interpersonal relationships. As such it may have repercussions on the life-style of the family. This study traces trends <b>in</b> <b>owner</b> <b>occupation</b> since 1900, and changes in the housing market since the Second World War. The dramatic rise in house prices in 1972 created an intense market situation. First-time purchasers in South-west Surrey were particularly disadvantaged. This study shows the process of buying a house to be a complex intermesh of relationships, yet people were forced to make rapid decisions. An attempt is made to analyse the possible influence of personal characteristics, parental experiences and previous housing conditions on the search and choice processes. The research found differences in attitudes may be associated with respondents' occupational class, and with their life style. The implications of the changing pattern in tenure has far-reaching repercussions. There is evidence to suggest the 'social mix' of local communities was changing: that those unable to buy a house may suffer intense feelings of social deprivation: and that the availability of housing may affect mobility and labour recruitment in the area. As such, the influence of housing should not be under-rated in social research...|$|E

40|$|British {{housing policy}} has, since 1979, been {{dominated}} by a shift from collectivist to market-oriented strategies. The single most important element of this policy shift has been the sale of public-sector dwellings to sitting tenants.
