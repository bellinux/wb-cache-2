40|$|The current paper {{discusses}} the exhaust flow features {{and the various}} unsteady flow separation characteristics in subscale overexpanded nozzles that lead to generation of side-loads. While a DiMR type of Mach reflection features in the exhaust of a truncated <b>ideal</b> contour <b>nozzle</b> an InMR occurs in a thrust optimized parabolic nozzle. The main contributor towards generation of sideloads in a parabolic nozzle {{is known to be}} the flow transitions (free shock separation →restricted shock separation and vice-versa) and the shock unsteadiness preceding them. However, in a truncated <b>ideal</b> contour <b>nozzle</b> (that features only FSS condition) the strongest cause of side-load origin are seen to be (i) the asymmetry of separation front around the nozzle circumference, (ii) length of separation region and, (iii) length of back-flow region. The flow asymmetry causes variations in pressure rise at separation and hence, in the local value of rms fluctuations. The length of separation region also shows considerable variations with NPR and tends to peak at NPR similar to those at which peaks in (σ w/Pw) max value and strain-gauge signal occur. Data therefore suggests that that the necessary condition for side-load generation in a TIC nozzle is not just the flow asymmetry but also the length of separation region which shows significant variation as the separation front gradually approaches the nozzle exit. The length of back-flow region, on the other hand, also seems to control the large-scale fluctuations of the separation front. As the extent of back-flow region decreases, the oscillations of separation shock die down with a subsequent drop in the side-load signal even when the separation front exhibits circumferential asymmetry...|$|R

A sample rocket plug nozzle is analyzed parametrically to evaluate the effect of varying Mach number at constant pressure and the effect of varying pressure ratio at constant Mach number. The results indicate that the interaction with a flowing airstream reduces the pressure of the external air, as seen from the nozzle exhaust jet, yielding a reduction of the performance. In particular, a dramatic decrease of nozzle performance may take place in the transonic region if the slipstream effect is neglected in the design.

40|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{experimental}} data regarding two-phase flow through safety relief valves, a number of different calculation methods are presently available in the literature for their sizing. All these models mainly refer to the flow through an <b>ideal</b> <b>nozzle,</b> so that, in order to match the measured values, a discharge coefficient is to be introduced in the calculation, the coefficient thus depending on the model adopted.

The measurements are compared with the predictions of a commonly used homogeneous equilibrium model (HEM), the so-called w method, and show that the model markedly underestimates the mass flow rate in the whole range of conditions investigated.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a method to}} find an optimal shape of a three-dimensional supersonic nozzle for a rectangular scramjet combustion chamber with rounded edges by {{taking into account the}} skin friction effects. The geometric and flow constraints are defined within the German DFG GRK 1095 / 2 project and the designed nozzle will be part of a scramjet demonstrator configuration. The nozzle inlet conditions are mean values of the combustion chamber exit conditions with the assumption of a constant specific heat ratio. To generate the shape of the nozzle a streamline tracing technique is applied to an axis-symmetric flow field calculated by the Method of Characteristics (MOC). Skin friction in relatively high pressure supersonic flow from the combustion chamber is very dominant and cannot be neglected in the design process. Therefore the skin friction is calculated using the Reference Temperature Method (RTM) and used for the determination of the thrust and moment vectors. This allows considering viscous effects without boundary layer calculations. With this approach an optimal truncated <b>ideal</b> <b>nozzle</b> contour which yields the geometric constraints can be derived. For the validation of this method comparative calculations have been carried out with the DLR code TAU on an exemplary axis-symmetric supersonic nozzle for different flow conditions.

Further simplifications of the approach for an efficient three-dimensional nozzle design will be addressed in the paper...|$|E

The results suggest that very different shock structures and flow separation may appear depending on the nozzle contour as well as on the operating pressure and temperature ratios. In the case of TOP nozzle, the simulations reveal the existence of a small recirculation bubble at the vicinity of the secondary injection, due to a shock/boundary layer interaction.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted on an Air Jet Vortex Generator (AJVG) consisting of a closely spaced set of four, geometrically related sub-orifices. The jet was a discretised version of an <b>ideal</b> <b>nozzle</b> featuring an injection width that smoothly increased by a function of Euler’s number (e). The exponential AJVG was used to suppress flow separation about a two-dimensional, NACA 6 series airfoil, with testing conducted at a Reynolds number of 6. 5 × 105. The exponential jet {{was designed to be}} used with a set of blowing profiles that also increased in velocity by a function of Euler’s number, with three groups of injection schemes devised for testing. The first set of blowing profiles were a discretised version of the ideal injection scheme and featured a four part, step-wise increase in velocity. The second set of blowing profiles had an injection velocity that was constant across the four sub-orifices of the jet. The final set of blowing profiles issued air from one sub-orifice only to mimic conventional manifestations of AJVG. Under conditions of a turbulent boundary layer, the discretised exponential blowing profiles consumed less energy to produce incremental recovery of lift coefficient up to 0. 38 when compared to the blowing profiles featuring a constant injection velocity. An 18 % reduction in energy consumption was noted for a 0. 34 incremental recovery of lift coefficient. Both of these sets of blowing profiles proved superior to the third set of “conventional” blowing profiles beyond incremental recoveries of lift coefficient of 0. 32. The literature on Tandem Jet In Cross Flow (TJICF) configurations and fluid jets was analysed to provide an explanation for the energy efficiency benefit provided by the multiple orifice AJVG operating with exponential blowing profiles. It is likely that the exponential qualities of the jet reduced the near field entrainment of ambient fluid into the resulting vortex preventing premature weakening of the structure, which resulted in elevated levels of vorticity in the near-field of injection. The natural decay of the structure from this initial, elevated magnitude of strength provided enhanced suppression of flow separation and recovery of lift coefficient...|$|E
40|$|It is a {{well known}} fact that most Francis turbines, because of the fixed blade design, faces {{challenges}} when running at partial load operation. Especially in the operating range below approximately 50 % of the rated output, {{it is common to}} observe severe pressure pulsations and surge in the draft tube. These pressure fluctuations are believed {{to be related to the}} swirling flow exiting the runner. By using water jets in the draft tube cone directed towards the swirling flow, the swirl strength is believed to be reduced and thereby also the pressure fluctuations produced by the swirl. This system thus has a potential of increasing the turbine operating range. The system can be activated when needed, and will not affect the turbine when running at its best efficiency point. Based on the main hypothesis, a simplified swirl rig was designed and constructed in order to investigate the nozzle influence on the swirling flow and on the pressure pulsations in a simplified environment. To expand the understanding of the nozzle performance in a Francis turbine, experiments were conducted in a model turbine with a prototype of movable nozzles. To establish a link between laboratory nozzle measurements and full scale nozzle measurements, field measurements were carried out on full scale Francis turbines running at partial discharge. For this purpose the turbines installed at Skarsfjord Power Station and Skibotn Power Station were used, where full scale nozzle injection systems were installed. The test results suggested that the concept of water injection worked, but not unconditionally. A reduction in pressure fluctuations was achieved both in laboratory and field experiments, as well as a noticeable reduction regarding fluctuations in the shaft run-out at Skibotn. In addition, water injection gave a surprisingly positive effect at overload conditions in the model turbine, even though the nozzle angle was directed in the same direction as the overload swirl. Ideally, the results from this project should be presented as a linear equation to give the <b>ideal</b> <b>nozzle</b> configuration for a given operating condition. This has not yet been possible because of the complexity of the system and its variable factors. However, several effects from changing nozzle variables individually have been detected, and are summarized in chapter 1 - Conclusions and Achievements. Efficiency measurements in the laboratory and in the field experiments indicated a possibility of increasing the hydraulic efficiency with the water injection system activated. This positive feature was believed to be caused by improvement of the velocity field in the draft tube. However, the total efficiency was always decreased because of the nozzle water bypass.

40|$|Operating a {{convergent-divergent nozzle}} under overexpanded {{conditions}} {{can lead to}} supersonic flow separation in the divergent section of the nozzle. In this case, an attached oblique shock wave forms at the separation base. The sudden pressure rise across the shock wave can cause damaging lateral pressure forces, or side-loads, {{to act on the}} nozzle if the separation line is asymmetric. Such asymmetry can be caused by downstream instabilities stemming from turbulence, external excitation or periodic modes. In this thesis the applicability of applying modal decomposition methods to supersonic nozzle flows was investigated. Axisymmetric RANS and URANS simulations of nozzle flows were investigated using the Arnoldi algorithm and the Dynamic Mode Decomposition,respectively. The Arnoldi method relies on a linearized flow solver and has the advantage of being able to detect asymmetric modes on two dimensional grids. The DMD, however, is a snapshot-based algorithm which needs no explicit linearization of the flow dynamics. Results show that these methods can successfully be applied to supersonic nozzle flows with separation and strong shocks. For example, the Arnoldi method predicted a helical screeching mode with impressive accuracy and The DMD analysis on perturbed 2 D URANS flow field was able to detect modes linked to transonic resonance. Finally, Detached Eddy Simulations (DES) on a separated flow inside a Truncated <b>Ideal</b> Contoured <b>Nozzle</b> were performed for two separate nozzle pressure ratios (NPR’s).

40|$|Aerospike nozzles {{are known}} to produce more thrust than {{conventional}} convergent-divergent nozzles in off-design conditions because of their capability to adapt their boundaries to ambient conditions. However, the central plug of an <b>ideal</b> aerospike <b>nozzle</b> can be very long and heavy, and its sharp end is susceptible to deformation in high temperatures. Plug truncation is a common measure to reduce an aerospike nozzle 9 ̆ 2 s weight and length, {{and to make it}} more feasible for application in a rocket propulsion system. While plug truncation makes an aerospike nozzle smaller, lighter and more practical, it causes loss of thrust because of low pressure in the base area of the truncated plug. To reduce this loss of thrust, a technique called base bleed is used, in which a secondary flow is injected {{at the base of the}} plug. Success of the base bleed technique depends on several factors, including position, direction, and amount of the injected flow, as well as the nozzles working conditions. In this research, effects of the amount of base bleed and the nozzle 9 ̆ 2 s working conditions on total base thrust and base pressure thrust of a truncated aerospike nozzle is numerically analysed, using results of previous research to select bleed position and direction. Numerical solution of the governing equations in axisymmetric coordinates has been carried out over an unstructured grid of triangular cells using a coupled implicit solver. The nozzle 9 ̆ 2 s internal and external flow has been analyzed in 6 sets of far-field boundary conditions, corresponding to under-expansion, optimum, and over-expansion working conditions. For each working condition, 5 amounts of base bleed ranging from 0 to 5...|$|R
40|$|During the {{transient}} {{phases of}} start-up and shut-down, liquid engine nozzles operate under severe over-expanded conditions. Furthermore, these transient phases result in rocket nozzles exhibiting dynamic off-axis loads caused by asymmetric internal separation. There are two recognisable types of flow separation, Free-Shock Separation, FSS, and Restricted-Shock Separation, RSS. It {{has been shown}} that the resultant separation type depends largely on nozzle geometry. Many studies have analysed these distinct separation patterns concluding that FSS topologies result in lower magnitude side forces than RSS ones. Moreover, it {{has been shown that}} Truncated <b>Ideal</b> Contour, TIC, <b>nozzles</b> only experience FSS separation. Thus, this work presents an experimental study of a TIC nozzle developed in a cold supersonic wind tunnel at PPrime Institute in Poitiers. The study consists of a series of pressure measurements as well as PIV and Schlieren Photography for a range of pre-selected pressure ratios which permit the characterisation of the regime where the nozzle undergoes the most significant jet fluctuations as it is believed that they are strongly associated with the side-loads...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe cross {{injection}} in a {{supersonic flow}} {{is an issue}} encountered in several aerodynamic applications such as fuel injection in scramjet combustor, missile control, drag reduction and thrust vector control. In a recent work, an analytical model has been presented to calculate the fluidic thrust vectoring performance for a supersonic axisymmetric nozzle. The model is able {{to take into account}} both the injected gas thermodynamic properties and the geometrical nozzle characteristics. The analytical model has been successfully validated following the cold air flow experimental analysis, in the case of fluidic thrust vectoring applied to conical nozzle. The aim of this work is to show how far the injected gas thermodynamic properties, {{different from that of the}} nozzle main flow, could influence the fluidic thrust vectorization parameters. In this work, the experimental performance of the fluidic thrust vectoring concept, using numbers of gases as injectant, has been qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. Schlieren visualization, force balance and wall pressure measurements were used in the case of a truncated <b>ideal</b> contour <b>nozzle.</b> The experimental results are compared to the numerical and analytical findings. Performance analysis are conducted and basic conclusions are drawn in terms of thermodynamic gas properties effect on the fluidic thrust vector system. The primary effect was related to the gas molecular weight and its specific heat ratio product. It is observed that for fixed injection conditions, the vectoring angle is higher when the injected gas molecular weight and specific heat ratio product is less than that of the primary gas. For a given mission of the launcher, it can be concluded that the mass of the embedded gas, used for the fluidic vectorization system, can be significantly reduced, depending on its molecular weight and specific heat ratio...|$|R
