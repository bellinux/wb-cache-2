Greater intensity of stimulation does not produce a stronger signal but can produce a higher frequency of firing. There are different types of receptor responses to stimuli, slowly adapting or tonic receptors respond to steady stimulus and produce a steady rate of firing. These tonic receptors most often respond to increased intensity of stimulus by increasing their <b>firing</b> <b>frequency,</b> usually as a power function of stimulus plotted against impulses per second.

2500|$|Neural oscillation, or brainwave, is rhythmic or {{repetitive}} neural {{activity in}} the central nervous system. Neural tissue can generate oscillatory activity in many ways, driven either by mechanisms within individual neurons or by interactions between neurons. [...] In individual neurons, oscillations can appear either as oscillations in membrane potential or as rhythmic patterns of action potentials, which then produce oscillatory activation of post-synaptic neurons. [...] At the level of neural ensembles, synchronized activity {{of large numbers of}} neurons can give rise to macroscopic oscillations, which can be observed in an electroencephalogram. Oscillatory activity in groups of neurons generally arises from feedback connections between the neurons that result in the synchronization of their firing patterns.

To measure herbaceous coverage, percentages were took of cover of each species within a square area and assigned a number (1 = 0 - 25 %, 2 = 25 - 50 %, 3 = 50 - 75 %, 4 = 75 - 100 %).

Similarities and differences in comparisons between study areas highlight important aspects of fire regimes and strengthen my interpretation and inference. In the GALWC, fire rotations were shortest during the recent wildfire use period (1975 - 1993) and longest during the pre-modern suppression period (1909 - 1946). In the SBWC, fire rotations were shortest during the pre-modern suppression period (1880 - 1934) and longest during the modern suppression period (1935 - 1975). Elevations with the highest <b>fire</b> <b>frequencies</b> differed between study areas. However, forest types found at these elevations are characterized by similar overstory tree species. Steeper northeastern slopes in the GALWC and southwestern slopes in the SBWC burned most frequently.
