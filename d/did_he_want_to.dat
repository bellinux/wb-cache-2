25|$|Clearly, Wittgenstein did {{not want}} to be a behaviorist, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be a cognitivist or a phenomenologist. He is, of course, {{primarily}} concerned with facts of linguistic usage. However, some argue that Wittgenstein is basically a behaviorist because he considers facts about language use as all there is. Such a claim is controversial, since it is not explicitly endorsed in the Investigations.|$|E
25|$|However, screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni stated on {{numerous}} occasions that he had written a treatment for a sequel, tentatively titled Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo n. 2 (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly 2). According to Vincenzoni and Eli Wallach, the film would have been set 20 years after the original, and would have followed Tuco pursuing Blondie's grandson for the gold. Clint Eastwood expressed interest in {{taking part in the}} film's production, including acting as narrator. Joe Dante and Leone were also approached to direct and produce the film respectively. Eventually, however, the project was vetoed by Leone, as he did not want the original film's title or characters to be reused, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be involved in another Western film.|$|E
500|$|Preferring to {{concentrate}} on broad policy matters and speeches, McGovern was not a master of Senate legislative tactics, and developed a reputation among some other senators for [...] "not doing his homework". Described as [...] "a very private, unchummy guy", {{he was not a}} member of the Senate [...] "club" [...] nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be, turning down in 1969 a chance to join the powerful Senate Rules Committee. Relatively few pieces of legislation bore his name, and his legislative accomplishments were generally viewed as modest, although he would try to influence the contents of others' bills. In his political beliefs, McGovern fit squarely within modern American liberalism; through 1967 he had voted in accordance with the rated positions of the ADA 92percent of the time, and when lacking specific knowledge on a particular matter, he would ask his staff, [...] "What are the liberals doing?" ...|$|E

500|$|Roddenberry {{realized}} {{early on}} that a series with the original crew from Star Trek was unlikely to be practical, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> recast the roles or have a [...] "retread" [...] crew– a series of different characters in very similar roles to the original series. He explained, [...] "I would hate to think our imagination is so slender that there aren't other possibilities to think about." [...] The first casting call was sent out on December 10, 1986. While some characters such as Geordi La Forge and Beverly Crusher remain recognizable from their descriptions in the initial casting call, others have clear differences; [...] "Julien Picard" [...] would lapse into a French accent when he became emotional, and Data was non-Caucasian. Macha Hernandez was a Latino security chief based on Jenette Goldstein's role in Aliens, while Deanna Troi was to appear [...] "foreign" [...] or more specifically of an Icelandic or Scandinavian nature. Leslie Crusher was listed as a fifteen-year-old girl with a photographic memory, although was quickly changed to a male teenager called Wesley. Justman argued for a female teenager but Roddenberry thought {{that there would be}} a greater number of storylines available if the character was male.|$|E
2500|$|This {{created a}} serious problem for Scott. He was troubled by the sweep of guilty verdicts. He {{did not want to}} {{alienate}} the Mexican public, who by now had made the deserters national heroes. Nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> encourage insurgency among the Mexican people that would weaken his pacification program in progress. He also knew that the deserters were Irish-born Catholics, who had deserted Taylor's army because they allegedly felt mistreated and had witnessed atrocities [...] "sufficient to make Heaven weep" [...] against fellow Catholics, the Mexicans. In response to these, in 1847, Scott ordered that Protestants respect Catholic ceremonies.|$|E
2500|$|Gibson did {{not want}} to expose his quarterback to further risk of injury, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> risk his players being fined for violating the league's rules against fighting. Most importantly, the last thing he wanted was for his team to get a penalty, which could stop the clock and require getting another first down to secure the win. [...] He also {{personally}} despised the kneeling play, considering it unsporting and somewhat dishonorable (a view popular among a lot of coaches of the period). Also given that the play clock at the time was only 30 seconds (as it would remain through the 1987 season), a play had to be run. So on second down he called [...] "65 Power-Up", a standard play which called for Csonka to take a handoff and run up the middle. Csonka took the ball and ran for 11 yards. For the third play in the Giants' series, the same play was called again.|$|E

6000|$|Then {{she turned}} {{fiercely}} on him, and fought him. He {{was not to}} do this to her, it was monstrous. What horrible hold <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> have over her body? Why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> drag her down, and kill her spirit? Why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> deny her spirit?

60|$|This plain {{answer was}} {{followed}} by a moment's silence. The housekeeper felt some little perplexity.

Doctors are not allowed to advertise; and I'm sure no doctor <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> advertise himself as looking like that. And even for our American guest the interest is the same. Let us suppose that he has conclusive documents. Let us assume that he has revelations really worth reading. Well, in a legal inquiry (or a medical inquiry, for that matter) ten to one he won't be allowed to read them. He'll be tripped up every two or three minutes with some tangle of old rules.
