25|$|The {{sequence}} was {{to portray}} life in France {{in the period}} following June 1940, the month in which the German army rapidly defeated the French and fought the British; Paris and northern France came under German occupation on June 14. The first novel, Tempête en juin (Storm in June) depicts the flight of citizens from Paris in the hours preceding the German advance and {{in the days following}} it. The second, Dolce (Sweet), shows life in a small French country town, Bussy (in the suburbs just east of Paris), in the first, strangely peaceful, months of the German occupation. These first two novels seem able to exist independently from each other on first reading. The links between them are rather tenuous; as Némirovsky observes in <b>her</b> <b>notebook,</b> it is the history and not the characters, that unite them.|$|E
25|$|This {{version of}} Light is {{different}} to his manga counterpart {{in the fact}} that he never loses sight of his goal to make the world better for the innocent. Unlike Light Yagami, Light Turner never kills any police officers and never truly lets the power of the Death Note overtake him. Instead, his ruthless qualities are transferred to Mia, who uses the notebook in secret to kill police and innocents that are trying to find Light and, by association, herself. In the end, she writes Light's name in the notebook to make him transfer ownership of the notebook to her, showing her true nature and calling the death note <b>her</b> <b>notebook.</b> However, Light creates a plan that will result in his survival and her death if she attempts to take the notebook, which she does despite how much he tries to convince her to let it go and be with him instead, having truly fallen in love with Mia by writing her name in it as well. In the end, through using two criminals that he controlled using the Death Note, Light manages to trick the police into believing that he wasn't Kira with the exception of his father, who worked out the truth after finding newspaper articles about his mother's murder. The film ends with his father asking Light, in response to what he said, if he was truly {{the lesser of two evils}} when compared to Mia while L finds a page of the death note, and wonders whether to write Light's name.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{international}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Scott Lyon and Sophie Muller and premiered in August 2004. The video features several sequences. It opens with Bedingfield {{sitting at a table}} in her Spanish villa, in Málaga, frustrated by her inability to find inspiration to write a song, and she cuts the flowers off by the window. She is then seen walking through the villa in colorful outfits, and sitting by the swimming pool, surrounded by dancing chairs, dancing radios, dancing books in the library, and multiple versions of herself. The video concludes with Bedingfield scribbling in <b>her</b> <b>notebook</b> on the roof of her villa. Her scribblings lead her boyfriend to the front of her home where she admits that she loves him and she goes to the balcony, asking him if her feelings are [...] "okay".|$|E

500|$|According to U.S. border surveillance, a white Mercury Grand Marquis with Mexican {{license plates}} 821-THE7 crossed at Brownsville border entry at 6:39p.m. CT on March 2. This car had crossed to Brownsville from Matamoros {{eighteen}} times between August 1992 and March 1993. When police {{went to the}} motel to check the register, they discovered that at 8:26p.m. CT that evening, Puentes Pizaña and Ramón Palomares, another hitman of the Cuellar organization, checked in with the receptionist. She registered the car in <b>her</b> <b>notebook</b> as a white Grand Marquis, but it was unclear if she wrote 821-WEX or 821-THE7 as the license plate number. Other evidence showed that several calls were made from Puentes Pizaña's and Garza's rooms to an identical Dallas number {{on the day of}} the murder. The police were never able to connect the number with the investigation, or identify the Dallas contact. Other evidence showed that Garza, along with Cuellar and Moya, visited a gun shop in Dallas to purchase a [...]38 Super pistol. After Fischer was killed, Garza said that the gun was stolen from his house in San Antonio after someone broke into it. The weapon was never recovered.|$|E
500|$|The {{events of}} Wings for My Flight take place {{throughout}} 1975. Marcy Cottrell Houle (then [...] "Marcy Cottrell"), a 21-year-old wildlife biologist, is sent by her supervisor, Barry Layne, to the U.S. Forest Service office near Chimney Rock in Colorado, where {{a pair of}} peregrine falcons reside. The pair {{is one of only}} seven pairs remaining in the Rocky Mountains region. Mr. Preston Fitch, an administrator involved with the peregrine falcon project, criticizes Houle for her lack of experience in the field upon meeting her. Nevertheless, Mr. Fitch introduces Houle to Chimney Rock. He explains that the Forest Service spent {{more than half a million}} dollars building a road which led to Chimney Rock; work on the road had to be discontinued upon discovery of the falcons. Further, the Chimney Rock area is home to 250 Anasazi ruins dated between 900 and 1100. The Chimney Rock community had been planning a million-dollar development to build a tourist attraction for the ruins. Houle spends several weeks with the peregrine falcons, recording her observations in <b>her</b> <b>notebook.</b> In spite of her initial attempt at maintaining an impersonal relationship with the falcons, Houle names the female peregrine [...] "Jenny" [...] and the male [...] "King Arthur". In the middle of June, after Houle had spent several days of making field observations alone and with limited equipment, Mr. Fitch introduces Houle to her teammate, Alex Porter. He also provides them with a garbage truck for transportation.|$|E

Gabriel Corte, a well-known writer, flees with his mistress and makes for Vichy, where he may or may not find refuge and employment. Charles Langelet, an aesthete, flees alone in his car, filching petrol from trusting acquaintances in order to get as far as the Loire; he returns to Paris and is killed, accidentally and memorably.|$|E

2500|$|Asha and Lata {{have also}} sung together. Their first duet {{was for the}} film Daman (1951). Some of their songs include [...] "Man Bhawan Ke Ghar aye" [...] (Chori Chori, 1956), [...] "Sakhi ri sun bole papihaa us paar" [...] (Miss Mary, 1957), [...] "O chaand jahaan woh jaaye" [...] (Sharada, 1957), [...] "Mere Mehboob Mein Kya Nahi" [...] (Mere Mehboob, 1963), [...] "Ai kash kisi deewane ko" [...] (Aaye Din Bahar Ke, 1966), [...] "Jabse Laagi Toose Najariya" [...] (Shikar, 1968), [...] "Main Haseena Nazneena Koi Mujhsa Nahi" [...] (Baazi, 1968), [...] "Main Chali Main Chali" [...] (Padosan, 1968), [...] "Chhap tilak sab" [...] (Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki, 1978), and [...] "Man kyun behka" [...] (Utsav, 1984). While singing, Lata used to hold <b>her</b> <b>notebook</b> in her right hand, while Asha held hers in the left hand. This meant Lata had her face away from Asha, making it {{difficult}} for them to [...] "anticipate" [...] each other.|$|E
2500|$|The plot of Némirovsky's third novel {{exists as}} a plot outline, with some contradictions, in <b>her</b> <b>notebook.</b> Benoît has [...] "friends" [...] (the nascent Communist resistance) in Paris. Lucile drives {{him to the}} city, where he is {{concealed}} by the Michauds, whom the Angelliers met briefly in Tempête en juin. In Paris, Benoît and Jean-Marie Michaud are denounced, arrested and in prison, meet Hubert. Jean-Marie is pardoned by the Germans, when Lucile contacts Bruno von Falk on his behalf. Benoît and his friends organize an escape and release Jean-Marie and Hubert. Jean-Marie and Lucile meet and fall in love but after learning that she is {{still in love with}} Bruno, he leaves to fight against the Germans and dies heroically. On the Eastern Front, Bruno is also killed, Lucile losing her French and German beloveds. In a sub-plot, the writer Gabriel Corte, a relatively minor and unsympathetic character in Tempête en juin, emerges as a propagandist and politician, initially collaborating with the Germans, later perhaps disaffected; Benoît dies brutally and full of hope.|$|E
2500|$|The satirist in Tsvetaeva plays second fiddle {{only to the}} poet-lyricist. Several satirical poems, moreover, {{are among}} Tsvetaeva's best-known works: [...] "The Train of Life" [...] ("Poezd zhizni") and [...] "The Floorcleaners' Song" [...] ("Poloterskaya"), both {{included}} in After Russia, and The Rat-catcher (Krysolov, 1925–1926), a long, folkloric narrative. The target of Tsvetaeva's satire is everything petty and petty bourgeois. Unleashed against such dull creature comforts is the vengeful, unearthly energy of workers both manual and creative. In <b>her</b> <b>notebook,</b> Tsvetaeva writes of [...] "The Floorcleaners' Song": [...] "Overall movement: the floorcleaners ferret out a house's hidden things, they scrub a fire into the door... What do they flush out? Coziness, warmth, tidiness, order... Smells: incense, piety. Bygones. Yesterday... The growing force of their threat is far stronger than the climax." [...] The poem which Tsvetaeva describes as liricheskaia satira, The Rat-Catcher, is loosely based on {{the legend of the}} Pied Piper of Hamelin. The Rat-Catcher, which is also known as The Pied Piper, is considered by some to be the finest of Tsvetaeva's work. It was also partially an act of homage to Heinrich Heine's poem Die Wanderratten. The Rat-Catcher appeared initially, in serial format, in the émigré journal Volia Rossii in 1925-1926 whilst still being written. It was not to appear in the Soviet Union until after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1956. Its hero is the Pied Piper of Hamelin who saves a town from hordes of rats and then leads the town's children away too, in retribution for the citizens' ingratitude. As in the other folkloric narratives, The Ratcatcher's story line emerges indirectly through numerous speaking voices which shift from invective, to extended lyrical flights, to pathos.|$|E
