Fujian University of Technology; Xiamen University; Fuzhou University; Huaqiao University; University of WollongongContraposed {{the reality}} of great market demand of <b>energy-saving</b> <b>lamp,</b> and its middle-high grade trends in production etc., {{the design of a}} high-performance production line control system of <b>energy-saving</b> <b>lamp</b> based on HMI and 485 network communication has the characteristics of good reliability, high efficiency and convenient operation. The production line control system is operated through human-machine interface, using RS- 485 bus for message communication, has a lower cost and a good prospect. The main function of <b>energy-saving</b> <b>lamp</b> production line is to use the precise positioning of the stepper motor to put the wick into the lamp accurately, and finally produce the finished lamp. Early control system mainly use single-chip and external buttons to achieve control, the disadvantage of which is more Operators are needed, inconvenient parameter adjustment and time-consuming. With the increasingly well-developed production technology, the design of <b>energy-saving</b> <b>lamp</b> production line has become increasingly sophisticated, which requires manual debugging and run automatically, and configure the production parameters freely in order to produce variety of models in the same production line. Using HMI enable the isolated control to the production line and real-time monitoring of the operating conditions of various parts intuitively, thus improves the safety, reliability, and additional value of the whole equipment. Based on the above requirements, we have designed a advanced production line control system of <b>energy-saving</b> <b>lamp,</b> which is composed of HMI, MCU and 36 station boards. 漏 (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland...|$|R

2500|$|A shortwave UV lamp can be {{made using}} a {{fluorescent}} <b>lamp</b> <b>tube</b> with no phosphor coating. These lamps emit ultraviolet light with two peaks in the UVC band at 253.7nm and 185nm due to the mercury within the lamp, {{as well as some}} visible light. From 85% to 90% of the UV produced by these lamps is at 253.7nm, whereas only 5–10% is at 185nm. The fused quartz glass tube passes the 253nm radiation but blocks the 185nm wavelength. Such tubes have two or three times the UVC power of a regular fluorescent <b>lamp</b> <b>tube.</b> These low-pressure <b>lamps</b> have a typical efficiency of approximately 30–40%, meaning that for every 100 watts of electricity consumed by the lamp, they will produce approximately 30–40 watts of total UV output.

40|$|Due to cataphoresis, axial {{segregation}} of mercury will {{occur when the}} gas discharge of a fluorescent lamp is operated {{by means of a}} direct current. A consequence of this is a non-uniform axial luminance distribution along the lamp. To determine the degree of axial mercury segregation experimentally, axial luminance distributions have been measured which are converted into axial mercury vapour pressure distributions by an appropriate calibration method. The mercury segregation has been investigated for variations in <b>lamp</b> <b>tube</b> radius (3. 6 – 4. 8 mm), argon buffer gas pressure (200 – 600 Pa) and lamp current (100 – 250 mA) at mercury vapour pressures set at the anode in the range from 0. 2 to 9. 0 Pa. From the experiments it has been concluded that the mercury vapour pressure gradient at any axial position for a certain <b>lamp</b> <b>tube</b> diameter, argon pressure and lamp current depends on the local mercury vapour pressure. This observation is in contrast to assumptions made in earlier modelling publications in which one mercury vapour pressure gradient is used for all axial positions. By applying a full factorial design, an empirical relation of the mercury segregation is found for any set of parameters inside the investigated parameter ranges...|$|R
40|$|Fluorescent lamps {{are used}} {{increasingly}} today. Considered <b>energy-saving</b> <b>lamps,</b> they become hazardous waste {{at the end}} of their life cycle.
