50|$|The {{advantage}} to <b>high-key</b> <b>lighting</b> {{is that it}} doesn't require adjustment for each scene which allows the production to complete the shooting in hours instead of days. The primary drawback is that <b>high-key</b> <b>lighting</b> fails to add meaning or drama by lighting certain parts more prominently than others.|$|E
50|$|<b>High-key</b> <b>{{lighting}}</b> is a {{style of}} lighting for film, television, or photography that aims to reduce the lighting ratio present in the scene. This was originally done partly for technological reasons, since early film and television did not deal well with high contrast ratios, but now is used to suggest an upbeat mood. It is often used in sitcoms and comedies. <b>High-key</b> <b>lighting</b> is usually quite homogeneous and free from dark shadows. The terminology comes from the higher balance in the ratio between the key light and the fill light in a traditional three point lighting setup.|$|E
50|$|Interval's {{lectures and}} classes covered the {{mechanics}} and aesthetics of portraiture, {{indoor and outdoor}} lighting, <b>high-key</b> <b>lighting,</b> posing, facial analysis, candid photography, oil and pastel print enhancement, evaluation of competition prints, principles of studio management, marketing, and sales.|$|E
50|$|The {{main light}} on a subject, usually placed at a 45 degree angle to the camera-subject axis. In <b>high-key</b> <b>lighting,</b> the key light {{provides}} {{all or most of}} the light in the scene. In low-key lighting, the key light provides much less of the total illumination.|$|E
50|$|<b>High-key</b> <b>lighting</b> {{found its}} use in {{classical}} Hollywood cinema because it was well suited for three-point lighting and other filmmaking traditions.It is an overall lighting design which uses the fill light and backlight to create low contrast between brighter and darker areas. It {{can be used for}} both daylight and night scenes.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, <b>high-key</b> <b>lighting</b> was {{achieved}} through multiple light sources lighting a scene—usually using three fixtures per person (left, right, and central) —which {{resulted in a}} uniform lighting pattern with very little modeling. Nowadays, multiple hot light sources are substituted by much more efficient fluorescent soft lights which provide a similar effect.|$|E
5000|$|A high-key image {{consists}} {{primarily of}} light tones, without dark shadows. A photograph or painting so composed features a diminished tonal range of primarily whites and light grays. [...] High key {{as a term}} used in describing paintings or photographs is related to but {{not the same as}} <b>high-key</b> <b>lighting</b> in cinema or photography.|$|E
50|$|Shows with bigger budgets {{have moved}} away from <b>high-key</b> <b>{{lighting}}</b> by using lighting set-ups different from the standard three-point lighting. Part {{of the reason for}} this is the advent of new lighting fixtures which are easier to use and quicker to set up. Another reason is the growing sophistication of the audience for TV programs and the need to differentiate.|$|E
5000|$|Low {{key light}} accentuates the {{contours}} of the subject by throwing areas into shade while a fill light or reflector may illuminate the shadow areas to control contrast. The relative strength of key-to-fill, known as the lighting ratio, can be measured using a light meter. Low key lighting has a higher lighting ratio, e.g., 8:1, than <b>high-key</b> <b>lighting,</b> which can approach 1:1.|$|E
50|$|Sven Nykvist, the {{longtime}} collaborator of Ingmar Bergman, also informed {{much of his}} photography with chiaroscuro realism, as did Gregg Toland, who influenced such cinematographers as László Kovács, Vilmos Zsigmond, and Vittorio Storaro with his use of deep and selective focus augmented with strong horizon-level key lighting penetrating through windows and doorways. Much of the celebrated film noir tradition relies on techniques Toland perfected in the early thirties {{that are related to}} chiaroscuro (though <b>high-key</b> <b>lighting,</b> stage lighting, frontal lighting, and other effects are interspersed in ways that diminish the chiaroscuro claim).|$|E
5000|$|On the Green Carpet was {{the first}} North Korean film {{to be invited to}} the Berlin International Film Festival, where it was {{screened}} in 2004 as a special one-off event. It had been chosen by the festival committee from a selection of ten films, and aroused a great deal of interest despite being shown without subtitles and with a German language-only voice-over. The predominantly German audience who saw the film later criticized it for its [...] "Nazi-style propaganda". Sheila Johnson of FIPRESCI regarded it as a [...] "rare and fascinating curiosity", but noted: [...] "On the Green Carpet, with its flat, <b>high-key</b> <b>lighting,</b> functional editing and over-fondness for the zoom lens, could have been made forty years ago; although the subject might be superficially similar, it was executed with none of the technical brilliance of a Leni Riefenstahl movie." ...|$|E
