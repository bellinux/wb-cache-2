In college, McEntire would attend local dances at the Oklahoma–Texas border so she could dance to Wills's music, commenting that, [...] "it didn't <b>get</b> <b>any</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> dancing to Bob Wills music".

500|$|On February 1, 2008, Gasol {{was traded}} to the Los Angeles Lakers along with a 2010 second round draft pick for Kwame Brown, Javaris Crittenton, Aaron McKie, the rights to Marc Gasol (Pau's younger brother), and 2008 and 2010 first round draft picks. There has been some {{controversy}} surrounding the trade. Chris Wallace denied in an ESPN article that he had been ordered by owner Michael Heisley to make the Grizzlies more attractive to a potential buyer. Wallace said, [...] "No one put pressure on me to do this, and Michael Heisley has actually been reluctant to move Pau." [...] He also said that they had been [...] "trolling" [...] the waters for a while and dealt with a number of teams. He selected the Lakers deal because [...] "it didn't <b>get</b> <b>any</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> this." [...] When Gasol departed the Grizzlies, he held twelve franchise records, including games played, minutes played, field goals made, free throws made and attempted, offensive, defensive, and total rebounds, blocked shots, turnovers, and points. Per game statistics, he leads Memphis in defensive and total rebounds along with blocked shots. On February 5, he made his first Lakers appearance in a game against the New Jersey Nets, during which he scored 24 points and had 12 rebounds in a 105–90 win over the Nets. On March 14, Gasol sprained his ankle in a game against the New Orleans Hornets, stepping on the foot of teammate Vladimir Radmanović in the first quarter. Gasol was expected to miss the remaining three games of the Lakers' road trip after x-rays came up negative. Gasol returned to the starting lineup on April 2 against the Portland Trail Blazers and played nearly thirty-two minutes, registering 10 points, six rebounds and seven assists. He admitted to feeling limited with the swelling in his ankle still present. Gasol helped the Lakers finish the regular season with {{the best record in the}} Western Conference (57–25), with him in the starting lineup the Lakers went 22–5. Kobe Bryant has also stated that playing with Gasol clicked from the start.|$|E

Luke van Leuveren of PALGN opined that Lili {{and the other}} new characters who debuted in Dark Resurrection [...] "fit well into the game and don’t feel tacked on."

NowGamer described Lili as [...] "an instant hit" [...] for her [...] "flowery girly-girl appearance" [...] and [...] "light-footed fighting style", because, the site wrote, [...] "she’s a girl and girls love that kind of stuff." [...] Brian Soboleski of TeamXbox included Lili among the site's eleven [...] "hotties in the Xbox universe" [...] for [...] "her role of a childish, yet seductive, fighter whose self confidence made her even more appealing." [...] She was listed as the ninth-"sexiest female video game character of all time" [...] by Albert Costill of AMOG in 2013: [...] "She’s a cute, blonde bombshell that blends street fighting with gymnastics.

[...] Kevin Wong of Complex listed her as the fifteenth-best Tekken character in 2013: [...] "If a player wants to kick ass and look impeccable doing it, Lili is the girl for the job." [...] Jayson Dubin of GameZone criticized Lili's [...] "faux originality" [...] in his 2006 review of Dark Resurrection: [...] "She's a decent character that {{offers a lot of}} moves to learn. But when I control her, I don't feel like I'm in the next evolution of Tekken. I feel like I'm charge of a rehash." [...] Tom Goulter of GamesRadar said in 2012, [...] " [...] nice to see that someone finally found a way to work a character with daddy issues into the Tekken series," [...] but Writtin King of Game Informer included Lili in his 2012 ranking of the most [...] "ridiculous" [...] Tekken characters on the basis of her primary costume. [...] " [...] supposed to believe Lili is proficient in street fighting? Give me a break." [...] King additionally commented on her storyline of being housebound by her father for fighting in the tournament: [...] "In other words, she got grounded. I wonder if she lost her telephone privileges, too." [...] In an official fan poll hosted by Namco in 2012, Lili was the most-requested Tekken character for inclusion in Tekken X Street Fighter with 16.72% (14,764) of 88,280 votes, finishing two hundredths of a percentage point ahead of Jun Kazama.|$|E
