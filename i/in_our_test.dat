5000|$|In 2004, CSICOP {{was accused}} of {{scientific}} misconduct over its involvement in the Discovery Channel's test of the [...] "girl with X-ray eyes", Natasha Demkina. In a self-published commentary, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Brian Josephson criticized the test and evaluation methods and argued that the results should have been deemed [...] "inconclusive" [...] rather than judged in the negative. Josephson, {{the director of the}} University of Cambridge's Mind-Matter Unification Project, questioned the researchers' motives, saying: [...] "On the face of it, it looks as if {{there was some kind of}} plot to discredit the teenage claimed psychic by setting up the conditions to make it likely that they could pass her off as a failure." [...] Ray Hyman, one of the three researchers who designed and conducted the test, published a response to this and other criticisms. CSI's Commission for Scientific Medicine and Mental Health also published a detailed response to these and other objections, saying that the choice of critical level was appropriate, because her claims were unlikely to be true: I decided against setting the critical level at seven because this would require Natasha to be 100% accurate <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>test.</b> We wanted to give her some leeway. More important, setting the critical value at seven would make it difficult to detect a true effect. On the other hand, I did not want to set the critical value at four because this would be treating the hypothesis that she could see into people's bodies as if it were highly plausible. The compromise was to set the value at five.|$|E

This phenomenon has already been shown in [4]. We have therefore measured the (average) received signal strengths between all pairs of nodes <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>testbed.</b> We use this information as the received signal strengths <b>in</b> <b>our</b> simulations. Furthermore, we have experimentally determined the SNR threshold of the CC 1000 radio on the Tnodes to be approximately 5 [*]dB.|$|R

40|$|Abstract In this paper, we analyze several metamor-phic virus generators. We {{define a}} {{similarity}} index {{and use it}} to precisely quantify the degree of metamorphism that each generator produces. Then we present a detec-tor based on hidden Markov models and we consider a simpler detection method based on our similarity index. Both of these techniques detect all of the metamorphic viruses <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>test</b> set with extremely high accuracy. In addition, we show that popular commercial virus scan-ners do not detect the highlymetamorphic virus variants <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>test</b> set. ...|$|E

30|$|We built three {{data sets}} to {{construct}} the DNA duplex stability priors: one positive single-strand binding data set, one positive double-strand binding data set, and one background data set. The positive data sets are constructed from 226 known binding sites <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>test</b> data set by splitting the known binding sites into single- and double-strand binding sets according to the binding preference of each TF. The background data set is generated as follows. For each verified binding site <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>test</b> set, we randomly select 20 genomic locations (from the same promoter sequence) with the average binding site of length 12, which results in a background set that is 20 {{times larger than the}} test set.|$|E
