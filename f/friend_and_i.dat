25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} that you have her, even though I loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, because you know I love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the interwar period, Arab nationalists bore Germany no ill-will, {{despite its}} earlier {{support for the}} Ottoman Empire. Like many Arab countries, it was {{perceived}} {{as a victim of}} the post-World War I settlement. Hitler himself often spoke of the 'infamy of Versailles'. Unlike France and Great Britain it had not exercised imperial designs on the Middle East, and its past policy of non-intervention was interpreted as a token of good will. While the scholarly consensus is that Husseini's motives for supporting the Axis powers and his alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy were deeply inflected by anti-Jewish and anti-Zionist ideology from the outset, some scholars, notably Renzo De Felice, deny that the relationship can be taken to reflect a putative affinity of Arab nationalism with Nazi/Fascist ideology, and that men like Husseini chose them as allies for purely strategic reasons, on the grounds that, as Husseini later wrote in his memoirs, 'the enemy of your enemy is your friend'.Translation: 'I have considered Germany to be a friendly country, because it was not a colonizing country, and it never harmed any Arab or Islamic country, and because it was fighting our colonialist and Zionist enemies, and because the enemy of your enemy is your <b>friend.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> was certain that Germany's victory would definitely save our countries from the danger of Zionism and colonization'.Mudhakkirat al-Hajj Amin al-Husayni, Damascus 1999 p.96. When Husseini eventually met with Hitler and Ribbentrop in 1941, he assured Hitler that 'The Arabs were Germany's natural friends because they had the same enemies... namely the English, the Jews, and the Communists'.|$|E

500|$|When Austen was twenty, Tom Lefroy, a neighbour, visited Steventon from December 1795 to January 1796. He {{had just}} {{finished}} a university degree and was moving to London for training as a barrister. Lefroy and Austen would have been introduced at a ball or other neighbourhood social gathering, {{and it is clear}} from Austen's letters to Cassandra that they spent considerable time together: [...] "I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together." ...|$|E

I went to Daniel, supposedly a <b>friend,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> said, 'This is going to fail and {{we now have the}} capability to do it, so let us ghost-write it.'" [...] Dworsky refused. Gehry was also quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying: [...] "We had the wrong executive architect doing the drawings. I helped pick him, I'm partly responsible. It brought us to a stop."" [...] Gehry told Los Angeles magazine in 1996 that he [...] "no longer speaks to his former friend (Dworsky)". Gehry continued his public attacks on Dworsky: [...] "He (Dworsky) made a lot of money. He begged me for the job. I'd like to shoot him." ...|$|E
500|$|Truman's brief vice-presidency was {{relatively}} uneventful. On April 10, 1945, Truman cast his only tie-breaking vote as President of the Senate, against a Robert A. Taft {{amendment that would}} have blocked the postwar delivery of Lend-Lease Act items contracted for during the war. Roosevelt rarely contacted him, even to inform him of major decisions; the President and Vice President met alone together only twice during their time in office. In {{one of his first}} acts as vice president, Truman created some controversy when he attended the disgraced Pendergast's funeral. He brushed aside the criticism, saying simply, [...] "He was always my <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have always been his." [...] He had rarely discussed world affairs or domestic politics with Roosevelt; he was uninformed about major initiatives relating to the war and the top-secret Manhattan Project, which was about to test the world's first atomic bomb. He was also photographed with actress Lauren Bacall sitting atop the piano at the National Press Club as he played for soldiers.|$|E

Two months later, she endured several broken ribs, which prevented her from attending a speech given by Paul Ryan in the Reagan Presidential Library in May 2012; her spokesperson said, [...] "Mrs. Reagan has been recovering slowly {{and has been}} adding a few appointments back on to her schedule, but was advised by her doctor today not to try and attend large events too far from home just yet."

500|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November {{was at home}} to Charlton Athletic. The team conceded four {{goals in}} 20 minutes and blew several chances to [...] "kill the game", in what was the club's biggest home defeat in the league under Wenger. An away trip to local rivals Tottenham Hostpur became {{magnified}} with interest, given it marked the return of Campbell following his move to Arsenal. An 81st-minute goal scored by Pirès put Arsenal into the lead, before a lapse by Wright in goal allowed Gus Poyet‘s shot to squirm from his grasp and enter the goalnet. Arsenal then faced league champions Manchester United {{and in spite of}} conceding inside 14 minutes through a Paul Scholes’ strike, Ljungberg equalised for them [...] "with a wonderful chipped finish, following Gary Neville's wretched error." [...] Arsenal improved in the second half but scored in unforeseen fashion: United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez passed the ball directly into the feet of Henry, who profited from the error and scored. Five minutes later, Barthez's failure to grasp the ball presented Henry the chance to score his second, which he did. Both Henry and Wenger defended the opposition goalkeeper, with the former, his international teammate saying: [...] "Of course I was happy to score the goals but it was strange. He's my good <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> feel sorry for him; I would rather have got them another way." ...|$|E
500|$|Specter {{received}} several high-profile endorsements {{during the final}} {{weeks leading up to}} the primary. Senator John Kerry, who had been an early supporter of Sestak's 2006 House campaign, endorsed Specter in the Senate race, calling him [...] "fighter and a <b>friend,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am proud to vouch for his character". The Philadelphia Inquirer called Sestak [...] "a worthy opponent" [...] and said that his determination made the race especially competitive, but ultimately embraced Specter, whose overall career record the newspaper said was [...] "a good choice for Democrats". The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette also endorsed Specter, focusing more on the fact that Specter stood the best chance of defeating Toomey in a general election challenge. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, however, endorsed Sestak, calling him [...] "incredibly intelligent, thoughtful and articular" [...] while condemning Specter as a [...] "self-serving political ferret" [...] for switching parties. Actor Michael J. Fox, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, appeared in a television advertisement for Specter, praising the Senator for his long-standing support of stem cell research. Fox said, [...] "In the fight against disease, you can look back or move forward. Arlen Specter is moving forward." [...] President Obama sent e-mail messages to his Organizing for America supporters encouraging them to vote for Specter, However, despite his long position of support for Specter, Obama did not fly to Pennsylvania to actively campaign for the Senator during the campaign's final days.|$|E

The Bhutanese government ordered the country's flags to fly at half-staff to mourn Kalam's death, and lit 1000 butter lamps in homage. Bhutanese Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay expressed deep sadness, saying Kalam [...] "was a leader greatly admired by all people, especially {{the youth of}} India who have referred {{to him as the}} people's President". Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina described Kalam as [...] "a rare combination of a great statesman, acclaimed scientist, and a source of inspiration to the young generation of South Asia" [...] and termed his death an [...] "irreparable loss to India and beyond". Bangladesh Nationalist Party chief Khaleda Zia said [...] "as a nuclear scientist, he engaged himself in the welfare of the people". Ashraf Ghani, the President of Afghanistan, called Kalam [...] "an inspirational figure to millions of people," [...] noting that [...] "we have a lot to learn from his life". Nepalese Prime Minister Sushil Koirala recalled Kalam's scientific contributions to India: [...] "Nepal has lost a good <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have lost an honoured and ideal personality." [...] The President of Pakistan, Mamnoon Hussain, and Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif also expressed their grief and condolences on his death. The President of Sri Lanka, Maithripala Sirisena, also expressed his condolences. [...] "Dr. Kalam was a man of firm conviction and indomitable spirit, and I saw him as an outstanding statesman of the world. His death is an irreparable loss not only to India but to the entire world." [...] Maldivian President Abdulla Yameen and Vice-President Ahmed Adheeb condoled Kalam's death, with Yameen naming him as a close friend of the Maldives who would continue to be an inspiration to Indians and generations of South Asians. Former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who had made an official visit to India during Kalam's presidency, termed his demise as a great loss to all of humankind. The Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Armed Forces, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, expressed condolences on behalf of the Myanmar government. The Dalai Lama expressed his sadness and offered condolences and prayers, calling Kalam's death [...] "an irreparable loss".|$|E

Later messages revealed his plan to use a vehicle until it became inoperable, and then to use a knife to continue the attack on foot. He waited for Chūō-dōri to close at noon to vehicular traffic before commencing the attack.|$|E
2500|$|You scold {{me so much}} in {{the nice}} long letter which I have this moment {{received}} from you, that I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish <b>friend</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together. I can expose myself however, only once more, because he leaves the country soon after next Friday, on which day we are to have a dance at Ashe after all. He is a very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man, I assure you. But as to our having ever met, except at the three last balls, I cannot say much; for he is so excessively laughed at about me at Ashe, that he is ashamed of coming to Steventon, and ran away when we called on Mrs. Lefroy a few days ago.[...] [...]After I had written the above, we received a visit from Mr. Tom Lefroy and his cousin George. The latter is really very well-behaved now; and as for the other, he has but one fault, which time will, I trust, entirely remove — it is that his morning coat is a great deal too light. He is a very great admirer of Tom Jones, and therefore wears the same coloured clothes, I imagine, which he did when he was wounded.|$|E
2500|$|He {{began his}} career with bit parts in smaller movies, {{including}} Myra Breckinridge, Coma, and The Seven Minutes. He also appeared {{in a number of}} TV series, mini-series and TV movies. Still struggling as an unfamiliar, television actor, Selleck also had a recurring role in the 1970s as [...] "too good to be true" [...] private investigator Lance White in The Rockford Files. An avid James Garner fan, since childhood, who also watched his mentor's show, Selleck's Lance was very trusting and always lucky, much to the annoyance of Jim Rockford. White would frequently say to Rockford, [...] "Don't worry, Jim; clues will turn up," [...] and then a clue would just turn up, much to Rockford's consternation, for whom obtaining clues required hard work and hard knocks. Selleck's character was based on one played in Garner's earlier TV series Maverick (1957) by Wayde Preston in the episode [...] "The Saga of Waco Williams". Despite appearing in only 2 episodes, and in later interviews, Selleck credited Garner [...] "as a mentor," [...] and continued to stay friends with him, for over 35 years, until his childhood movie hero's, mentor's and friend's death, on July 19, 2014. Upon his death, he said of his TV private investigator: [...] "Jim was a mentor to me and a <b>friend,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will miss him." [...] Two years after Garner's death, Selleck also said, prior to filming his then 6th season of his top-rated series, Blue Bloods: [...] "It’s kind of like my mentor, who never wanted to hear he was my mentor (James Garner), I don’t accept the mentor role. That they feel that way is, I think flattering although it adds a certain amount of pressure." ...|$|E
