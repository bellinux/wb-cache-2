25|$|On 3 July 1980, Vysotsky gave a {{performance}} at a suburban Moscow concert hall. One {{of the stage}} managers recalls that he looked visibly unhealthy ("gray-faced", as she puts it) and complained of not <b>feeling</b> <b>too</b> good, while another says she was surprised by his request for champagne {{before the start of}} the show, as he had always been known for completely abstaining from drink before his concerts. On 16 July Vysotsky gave his last public concert in Kaliningrad. On 18 July, Vysotsky played Hamlet for the last time at the Taganka Theatre. From around 21 July, several of his close friends were on a round-the-clock watch at his apartment, carefully monitoring his alcohol intake and hoping against all odds that his drug dependency would soon be overcome and they would then be able to bring him back from the brink. The effects of drug withdrawal were clearly getting the better of him, as he got increasingly restless, moaned and screamed in pain, and at times fell into memory lapses, failing to recognize at first some of his visitors, including his son Arkadiy. At one point, Vysostsky's personal physician A. Fedotov (the same doctor who had brought him back from clinical death a year earlier in Uzbekistan) attempted to sedate him, inadvertently causing an asphyxiation from which he was barely saved. On 24 July, Vysotsky told his mother that he thought he was going to die that day, and then made similar remarks to a few of the friends present at the apartment, who begged him to stop such talk and keep his spirits up. But soon thereafter, Oksana Afanasyeva saw him clench his chest several times, which led her to suspect that he was genuinely suffering from a cardiovascular condition. She informed Fedotov of this, but was told not to worry, as he was going to monitor Vysotsky's condition all night. In the evening, after drinking relatively small amounts of alcohol, the moaning and groaning Vysotsky was sedated by Fedotov, who then sat down on the couch next to him but fell asleep. Fedotov awoke in the early hours of 25 July to an unusual silence, and found Vysotsky dead in his bed with his eyes wide open, apparently of a myocardial infarction, as he later certified. This was contradicted by Fedotov's colleagues, Sklifosovsky Emergency Medical Institute physicians L. Sul'povar and S. Scherbakov (who had demanded the actor's instant hospitalization on 23 July, but were, allegedly, defied by Fedotov), who insisted that Fedotov's incompetent sedation combined with alcohol was what killed Vysotsky. An autopsy was prevented by Vysotsky's parents (who were eager to have their son's drug addiction remain secret), so the true cause of death remains unknown.|$|E

Caballero said that [...] "We didn't want to make exact sculptural copies of the cartoon drawings and layouts, just because it might've ended up <b>feeling</b> <b>too</b> 'perfect' or something. So we chose to re-appropriate real world objects as much as possible." [...] Art director Kelly Mazurowski focused on [...] "digging through salvage yards", picking the right materials {{to be used in}} the set.

Watros said about the reunion with Hurley and Libby in season six: [...] " [...] so sweet and honest.

500|$|... "The Red Woman" [...] was {{positively}} received by critics {{who found the}} episode to be a satisfactory launching point for the season, and praising the scenes involving Sansa and Brienne, {{as well as the}} closing reveal with Melisandre, although the Dorne storyline was criticized once again for <b>feeling</b> <b>too</b> abrupt and deviating greatly from the books. For filming of the episode's closing reveal, the director used similar technique to the body double of Cersei Lannister in the previous episode. The episode title is an allusion to the epithet used to describe the Red Priestess Melisandre. In the United States, the episode premiere achieved a viewership of 7.94 million in its initial broadcast, and a same-day total including the streaming services HBO Go and HBO Now of 10.7 million viewers, a record for the series.|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} first {{unveiled}} at E3 2006. From early previews of the game, inevitable comparisons of {{elements such as}} platforming and shooting between Uncharted and the well-known Tomb Raider series were drawn, earning the title the nickname of [...] "Dude Raider". However, the developers saw their game as concentrating more on third-person cover-based play, in contrast to Tomb Raiders [...] "auto-aiming" [...] play and greater puzzle-solving elements. Other influences they cited include Resident Evil 4, Kill Switch, and Gears of War. Throughout the game's development the staff tried to remain flexible and detached from the original design concepts; attention {{was focused on the}} features that worked well, while features that did not work were removed. The development team intended the game's main setting, the island, to play a big role in the overall experience. <b>Feeling</b> <b>too</b> many games used bleak, dark settings with monochromatic color schemes, they wanted the island to be a vibrant, believable game world that immersed the player and encouraged exploration.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Square Enix {{employees}} Kenichiro Fukui and Tsuyoshi Sekito {{formed an}} experimental partnership to compose {{music for the}} video game All Star Pro-Wrestling in a rock style. After the game's success, the two continued to compose in the same style. In 2002, Fukui and Sekito decided to arrange some of the compositions of Nobuo Uematsu, the primary composer for {{the music of the}} Final Fantasy series. Uematsu, a fan of rock music, enjoyed these arrangements, and Fukui and Sekito asked him to join them in making a rock band. Declining at first due to <b>feeling</b> <b>too</b> busy with his composing duties and attempts to become a music producer with his Smile Please label, Uematsu agreed to join them in a single live performance as a keyboardist. At the performance, Uematsu felt a [...] "mix of stage fright and excitement, [...] all the crowds cheering, the audience paying full attention", and decided to join the two in making a band; Fukui and Sekito had refused to start one if Uematsu was not involved as one of the musicians.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} from Zap2it, Rick Porter gave the pilot praise for {{bringing}} together the central theme, saying [...] "No other new show this fall {{is attempting to}} tell a bigger story, and we're hoping the rough patches smooth out and it fulfills the potential that's there in its very strong cast and premise." [...] It also cited Jennifer Morrison and Jared Gilmore's performances when they appear in scenes together: [...] "As such it falls to Morrison to move the story along in this world, and fortunately for the audience she's able to pull it off. She gives a confident, grounded performance that helps keep the show from <b>feeling</b> <b>too</b> fantastical, and her rapport with Gilmore is a big plus too." [...] He also notes the writers and producers have put together a great premise and expects they'll have more as the series progresses: [...] "Given the cast and the people involved behind the scenes... we're more optimistic than not that Once Upon a Time will find its way. But if it doesn't, at least it will go down swinging." ...|$|E

500|$|The Allied nations invaded Italy in September 1943 and by mid-1944 {{had pushed}} the Germans {{back to the}} Gothic Line in the North of the country.

German forces in the French Riviera (originally threatened by Vendetta) were to be put at relative ease, but not left <b>feeling</b> <b>too</b> secure lest they be moved to re-inforce Normandy. Planning for the operation was handled by 'A' Force; the department in charge of deception in the Middle East. A large part of the operation planning was handed to Major Eugene J Sweeney, an Irish-American career officer who had joined the department in late 1943 with the express task of learning the arts of deception before the war ended. Working out of Algiers, at Advanced HQ (West), Sweeney helped implement several deceptions. The most notable of these was Operation Oakfield, the cover plan for Operation Shingle and the Battle of Anzio.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode, writing {{that while there}} had been a [...] "self-congratulatory quality" [...] to Glee since its mid-season break, [...] "Bad Reputation" [...] was a return to [...] "the Glee [...] fell in tormented love with." [...] He graded the songs performed [...] "C−" [...] through to [...] "A−", commending what he deemed [...] "by far the greatest performance of [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] ever". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson also felt the episode was a return to form. He praised the decision not to [...] "apply meaningless rules to their musical selections", writing: [...] "The freedom to not have to use songs by one artist let the storylines take priority, and not sticking to songs that share a common lyrical theme kept those choices from <b>feeling</b> <b>too</b> forced." [...] Dave Itzkoff of the New York Times recapped the episode positively, describing it as: [...] "pack more camp into an hour's worth of television than most kids will get all summer." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded [...] "Bad Reputation" [...] "B+", writing that he: [...] "enjoyed the episode quite a bit, even as [...] found some of it rather messy." [...] Though VanDerWerff felt that not everything in the episode worked, he stated: [...] "the stuff that did reminded me that what I like about the show is its all-out embrace of a crazy mishmash of tones." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Observer, Alison Kelly of the University of Oxford {{observed}} the novel's philosophical qualities, and opined that its [...] "thriller-style hints and foreshadowings... {{form part of}} a metaphysical investigation." [...] Kelly describes it as an exposé of the worst depths of human nature, labelling it existentialist' {{to the extent that}} it confronts the minimal limits of identity". She further argues that the novel's motif of facial recognitions amounts to the message that people should be read [...] "at face value", and that furthermore, past action is the greatest indicator of future behaviour, leaving no room for [...] "change, growth, [...] self-reinvention". In terms of stylistic literary changes, Ellis also displays more fondness for the Ruskinian pathetic fallacy than in previous works. For the most part, the novel is written in Ellis' trademark writing style; Lawson refers to this as [...] "sexual and narcotic depravities in an emotionless tone." [...] With regard to this style, Ellis cites precursors to himself, particular the work of filmmakers. Ellis feels that the technique itself gives the reader a unique kind of insight into the characters, and comments that [...] "numbness is a <b>feeling</b> <b>too.</b> Emotionality isn't the only feeling there is." [...] In terms of style, Ellis told Vice that he enjoyed his return to minimalism, because of the challenge of [...] "rying to achieve that kind of tension with so few words was enjoyable to do." [...] While some reviewers of popular fiction derided Ellis's style as [...] "flat", others found it unexpectedly moving.|$|E

500|$|... "Love Story" [...] {{came along}} {{late into the}} {{production}} of Fearless. Swift wrote [...] "Love Story" [...] {{about a man who}} was never officially her boyfriend. When she introduced him to her family and friends, they did not become fond of him. [...] "His situation was a little complicated, but I didn't care", said Swift. Swift also felt like {{it was the first time}} she could relate to the plot of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (1597), one of her favorite narratives, which she described as, [...] "The only people who wanted them to be together were them." [...] She conceived the idea for the song when she reflected about the scenario: [...] "I thought, 'This is difficult but it's real, it matters—it's not simple or easy but it's real'." [...] She then centered the song on the line, which was ultimately placed in the [...] "Love Story"'s second refrain. All events, with the exclusion of the end, narrated in the song regarded Swift's actual story. The song's conclusion differed from that of Romeo and Juliet. [...] "I feel like they had such promise and they were so crazy for each other. And if that had just gone a little bit differently, it could have been the best love story ever told. And it is one of the best love stories ever told, but it's a tragedy." [...] Instead, she chose to write a happy ending. She took her favorite characters and conceptualized the ending she believed they deserved. She perceived it to be the ideal ending that girls hoped for, including herself. [...] "You want a guy who doesn’t care what anyone thinks, what anyone says." [...] Although it was fictional, Swift said it was an enjoyable experience to write about. Swift wrote the track on her bedroom floor in approximately twenty minutes, <b>feeling</b> <b>too</b> inspired to put the song down unfinished.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1970, at age 65, {{urged by}} the Abbot of the Abbey of Hauterive and Dominican theologian Father Marie-Dominique Philippe {{to teach the}} seminarians personally, Lefebvre, <b>feeling</b> <b>too</b> old to {{undertake}} such a large project, told them he would visit François Charrière, Bishop of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg, with a request {{to set up a}} religious society. He told them, if he said to go through with it, he would see in it a sign of Divine Providence. Charrière granted Lefebvre's request and, with a document predated by six days to 1 November 1970, he established the Society of St. Pius X as a pia unio (Latin, for [...] "pious, or holy, union") on a provisional (ad experimentum) basis for six years. Pia unio status was the first stage through which a Catholic organisation passed prior to gaining official recognition as a religious institute or society of apostolic life. (Since 1983, the term [...] "association of the faithful" [...] has replaced [...] "pia unio".) The Society of Saint Pius X was formally founded, adhering to all canonical norms, and receiving the episcopal blessing and encouragement of the local ordinary. Some Swiss laymen offered the seminary at Ecône to the newly formed group, and in 1971 the first 24 candidates entered, followed by a further 32 in October 1972.|$|E
