50|$|The <b>double</b> <b>hetero{{structure}}</b> is a {{very useful}} structure in optoelectronic devices and has interesting electronic properties. If one of the cladding layers is p-doped, the other cladding layer n-doped and the smaller energy gap semiconductor material undoped, a p-i-n structure is formed. When a current {{is applied to the}} ends of the pin structure, electrons and holes are injected into the heterostructure. The smaller energy gap material forms energy discontinuities at the boundaries, confining the electrons and holes to the smaller energy gap semiconductor. The electrons and holes recombine in the intrinsic semiconductor emitting photons. If the width of the intrinsic region is reduced to the order of the de Broglie wavelength, the energies in the intrinsic region no longer become continuous but become discrete. (Actually, they are not continuous but the energy levels are very close together so we think of them as being continuous.) In this situation the <b>double</b> <b>heterostructure</b> becomes a quantum well.|$|E
50|$|The idea of {{the quantum}} well {{occurred}} to Henry in late 1972. While thinking about optical waveguides, Henry suddenly realized that a <b>double</b> <b>heterostructure</b> is a waveguide for electrons, and that a heterostructure with a thin central active layer would have discrete electron modes. Such a heterostructure was later named a quantum well, and the modes are the electron states of the quantum well.|$|E

5000|$|Later {{that year}} while pondering {{the physics of}} waveguides, Henry had a {{profound}} insight. He realized that a <b>double</b> <b>heterostructure</b> {{is not only a}} waveguide for light waves, but simultaneously for electron waves. Henry was drawing upon the principles of quantum mechanics, according to which electrons behave both as particles and as waves. He perceived a complete analogy between the confinement of light by a waveguide and the confinement of electrons by the potential well that is formed from the difference in bandgaps in a <b>double</b> <b>heterostructure.</b> [...] C.H. Henry realized that, just as there are discrete modes in which light travels within a waveguide, there should be discrete electron wavefunction modes in the potential well, each having a unique energy level. His estimate showed that if the active layer of the heterostructure is as thin as several tens of nanometers, the electron energy levels would be split apart by tens of milli-electron volts. This amount of energy level splitting is observable. The structure Henry analyzed is today called a [...] "quantum well." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{the work}} on <b>double</b> <b>heterostructure</b> lasers Panish {{continued}} to demonstrate variants of the laser structures with other collaborators in work done through the late 1970s, but the major thrust of his work {{for the rest of}} his career (until 1992) was to exploit the new opportunities presented by the use of lattice matched semiconductor heterostructures for other devices (detectors, transistors) and for the study of the physics of small layered structures.|$|E
50|$|After this {{experiment}} showed {{the reality of}} the predicted quantum well energy levels, Henry tried to think of an application.He realized that the quantum well structure would alter the density of states of the semiconductor, and result in an improvedsemiconductor laser requiring fewer electrons and electron holes to reach laser threshold. Also, he realized that the laser wavelengthcould be changed merely by changing the thickness of the thin quantum well layers, whereas in the conventional laser a change in wavelengthrequires a change in layer composition.

5000|$|A {{solution}} to the problem was proposed theoretically by Herbert Kroemer in 1963 [...] - [...] a double heterojunction laser but failed to suggest a suitable (lattice matched) combination semiconductors. The combination of such materials used for the first CW lasers was GaAs (Gallium Arsenide) and Aluminum Gallium Arsenide. The idea was to place a material like GaAs, with a smaller band gap, between two layers of a material such as aluminum gallium arsenide (a solid solution of AlAs and GaAs) that had a larger band gap; this confined the charge carriers and the optical field (the light) to this layer, reducing the current needed for lasing. Panish and Izuo Hayashi independently developed first the single heterostructure laser and then the <b>double</b> <b>heterostructure</b> laser. However, publication of the announcement of the first room temperature continuously operating <b>double</b> <b>heterostructure</b> laser was by Zhores Alferov in 1970 one month before Hayashi and Panish published similar results. Although there was some degree of contact between the group in Leningrad and the group in New Jersey including a visit by Alferov to the New Jersey lab, the two achievements were obtained independently. Panish experimented with making wafers using a new form of liquid-phase epitaxy while Hayashi tested the laser properties. Panish and Hayashi observed what they thought might be CW operation in several wafers in the weeks before their final demonstration. That had to await a laser that lived long enough for a complete plot of the lasing spectrum to be achieved. Over the Memorial Day weekend in 1970, while Panish was at home, Hayashi tried a diode and it emitted a continuous-wave beam at just over 24 degrees Celsius {{and he was able to}} plot the complete spectrum with the very slow equipment available at the time. He left a note on Panish's door: [...] "C. W. definite!! at 24°C 10:30 A.M. June 1, 1970." [...] A top manager, in violation of lab rules, brought a couple of bottles of champagne to celebrate.|$|E

Here we report an unprecedented fluorescence enhancement with a novel architecture of multilayer three-dimensional colloidal photonic crystals self-assembled from polystyrene spheres. The new technique uses a <b>double</b> <b>heterostructure,</b> which comprises a top and a bottom layer with a periodicity overlapping the excitation wavelength (E) of the emitters, and a middle layer with a periodicity matching the fluorescence wavelength (F) and a thickness that supports constructive interference for the excitation wavelength.
