5|$|Route370 {{was first}} signed along Crosstown Highway in1928 <b>from</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> western {{terminus}} of Route171 (then designated Route70) in Ararat Township to an intersection with Route570, another spur of Route70 in the hamlet of Preston Park. The entire stretch was paved by the Pennsylvania Department of Highways in1932. At that point, Route570 used the current alignment from the intersection with Shehawken Road to the intersection with Route90 (now Route191). Route570, along with Route470 and Route270 were decommissioned in 1946 by the Department of Highways, and Route370 was extended along the alignment from Shehawken Road to Route90. In 1961, Route370's termini both changed to Route171 and Route191 when both were renumbered to prevent duplication with Interstate 70 and Interstate 90.|$|E
5|$|The Caltrain Modernization Program (CalMod) is a $1.9billion {{project that}} will add a {{positive}} train control (PTC) system and electrify {{the main line}} of the U.S. commuter railroad Caltrain, which serves cities in the San Francisco Peninsula and Silicon Valley, as well as transition <b>from</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> diesel-electric locomotive powered trains to electric multiple units (EMU). According to Caltrain, electrification of the tracks will allow it to improve service times via faster acceleration and shorter headways, reduce air pollution and noise, and facilitate a future railway tunnel (the Downtown Rail Extension) into downtown San Francisco's Transbay Transit Center (as diesel trains cannot serve underground stations).|$|E

5|$|While {{the general}} routing of NY18 between Youngstown and Rochester {{was the same}} in 1930 as it is now, it {{initially}} followed a slightly different alignment through eastern Orleans County and western Monroe County. NY18 broke <b>from</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> alignment at Carr Road and followed Carr, Kenmore and Kendall Roads through the town of Kendall to the hamlet of Morton, from where it continued to Hamlin via the now-decommissioned NY360 and NY19. Additionally, NY18 utilized Hamlin Center Road and what is now NY260 between Hamlin and Roosevelt Highway.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{wanted to}} seize the high ground south of Gettysburg, {{primarily}} Cemetery Hill, which dominated the town, the Union supply lines, and the road to Washington, D.C., and he believed an attack up the Emmitsburg Road {{would be the best}} approach. He desired an early-morning assault by Longstreet's Corps, reinforced by Ewell, who would move his Corps <b>from</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> location north of town to join Longstreet. Ewell protested this arrangement, claiming his men would be demoralized if forced to move from the ground they had captured. And Longstreet protested that his division commanded by John Bell Hood had not arrived completely (and that Pickett's division had not arrived at all). Lee compromised with his subordinates. Ewell would remain in place and conduct a demonstration (a minor diversionary attack) against Culp's Hill, pinning down the right flank of the Union defenders so that they could not reinforce their left, where Longstreet would launch the primary attack {{as soon as he was}} ready. Ewell's demonstration would be turned into a full-scale assault if the opportunity presented itself.|$|E
5|$|NY118 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; however, it did not initially follow any of its modern alignment. Instead, NY118 headed northeastward <b>from</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> southern terminus on modern NY100 and US202 to a terminus at NY22 in Croton Falls while all of what is now NY118 was part of NY100. At the time, NY100 continued north along Baldwin Place Road and Myrtle Avenue to meet then-US6 near Mahopac Falls. In June 1934, the portion of NY118 between Somers and Croton Falls became concurrent to US202, a new interstate route extending from Delaware to Maine. The alignments of NY100 and NY118 north of New Croton Reservoir were flipped , placing NY118 on its modern alignment. NY118 initially continued north to NY6N over NY100's original alignment; however, this extension was eliminated in the mid-1940s. With the flip, NY118 terminated at a junction with NY129 in Croton Lake, while the latter extended to a traffic circle with NY100 in the hamlet of Pines Bridge. This alignment remained until , when the route was extended over the easternmost piece of NY129 to end at the traffic circle with NY100. The traffic circle in Pines Bridge was removed between 1988 and 1991 and replaced with a three-way intersection between the two routes.|$|E
