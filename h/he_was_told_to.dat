5|$|After {{the breakup}} of the Spirit Squad, he was repacked as Kenny Dykstra - an homage to {{baseball}} player Lenny Dykstra - with a new attire and a new theme music. He became interested in joining the group Rated-RKO, which consisted of Edge and Randy Orton. In order to join, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> prove himself first. He continued the feud with Ric Flair, managing to pick up three straight victories over Flair one being at New Year's Revolution (2007) before finally losing to him on the January 15, 2007 episode of Raw. Dykstra competed in the 2007 Royal Rumble match and got eliminated by Edge. After his feud with Flair, Dykstra become a mainstay on Raws sister show Heat, having feuds with both Eugene and Val Venis.|$|E
5|$|Because his Nung {{soldiers}} were exhausted, with their ammunition and water supplies running low, White believed {{they could not}} defend the Ngok Tavak garrison in case the VC launched another major attack. At 10:45, White requested permission to evacuate the garrison, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> stay {{and wait for the}} arrival of reinforcements. However, both White and Makowski knew that reinforcement was unlikely, because the two downed helicopters would prevent the insertion of additional soldiers, and the road between Ngok Tavak and Khâm Đức was likely to be covered by the opposing forces waiting in ambush positions. White then decided to evacuate Ngok Tavak and withdraw his troops to safety. As part of the evacuation plan, any type of equipment that could not be taken or was considered to be of value to the opponent was dumped into the command bunker and set alight using captured enemy flamethrowers. The Marines were ordered to fire their last remaining shells, about nine rounds in total, after their ammunition storage was set ablaze by the VC, and disable their 105mm guns.|$|E
5|$|By the age {{of twenty}} Lie had a good command of Sundanese and Malay; he also spoke fair Dutch, a rarity for ethnic Chinese at the time. Lie {{assisted}} van der Linden at the missionary school, and in the mid-1870s operated a general school for poor Chinese children. He also worked for the missionary's printing press, Zending Press, earning forty gulden a month while serving as editor of two religious magazines, the Dutch-language monthly De Opwekker and the Malay-language bi-weekly Bintang Djohor. He married Oey Pek Nio, seven years his junior, in 1876. Tio, {{in an interview with}} the scholar of Chinese Malay literature Claudine Salmon, stated that Lie had been betrothed to Oey's elder sister, but when she ran away the night before the ceremony, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> by his parents to marry Oey Pek Nio to save face. Although displeased with the arrangement, he obeyed. The pair soon grew close. The following year they had their first child, although the baby died soon after birth. Lie's mother died in 1879, and his father died the next year.|$|E

5|$|Sebastian Vettel slowly {{moved up}} the field, running {{eleventh}} on lap 18, only to spin a lap later at turn seven, falling back to 16th. He subsequently complained about a flat spot on his tyre, but continued without pitting. On lap 20, Sergio Pérez made a pit stop for new tyres and a front wing adjustment. Since the stop took longer than expected, he rejoined just before Sainz, Jr., who used the momentum to pass Pérez into turn one. Meanwhile, Räikkönen and Bottas were racing for sixth place. On lap 24, Bottas attacked around the outside into turn two, sticking to the inside line at the following corner, where Räikkönen did not back away {{and ran into the}} front-left of the Williams, breaking his own rear-right suspension and forcing him to retire on the spot, while Bottas was able to carry on. Rosberg came in for his scheduled pit stop on lap 27, while Hamilton waited two laps to follow suit, trying to get ahead. This proved unsuccessful, as he rejoined behind Rosberg after his stop on lap 29. On lap 35, Sergio Pérez attempted to overtake Carlos Sainz Jr. for ninth, who ran wide and kept his position. After his team radio informed him that he had done so by going off track, he handed the position to Pérez. Sebastian Vettel made a pit stop for a second time on lap 37 and rejoined in between the two Mercedes of Rosberg and Hamilton, albeit a lap down. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> let Hamilton go by as well some laps later.|$|E
5|$|The {{assault on}} Luga was still {{underway}} when Manstein received orders on 10 August that his next task {{would be to}} begin the advance toward Leningrad. No sooner had he moved to his new headquarters at Lake Samro than <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> send his men towards Staraya Russa to relieve the X Corps, which {{was in danger of}} being encircled. On 12 August the Red Army had launched an offensive with the 11th and 34th Armies against Army Group North, cutting off three divisions. Frustrated with the loss of the 8th Panzer and the missed opportunity to advance on Leningrad, Manstein returned to Dno. His counteroffensive led to a major Soviet defeat when his unit encircled five Soviet divisions, receiving air support {{for the first time on}} that front. They captured 12,000 prisoners and 141 tanks. His opponent, General Kuzma M. Kachanov of the 34th Army, was subsequently court martialed and executed for the defeat. Manstein tried to obtain rest days for his men, who had been constantly fighting in poor terrain and increasingly poor weather since the start of the campaign, but to no avail. They were ordered to advance to the east on Demyansk. On 12 September, when he was near the city, he was informed that he would take over 11th Army of Army Group South in Ukraine.|$|E

60|$|When my reader {{has studied}} awhile the confusion--for it {{is a true}} confusion--of the {{different}} beds, he will ask, or {{at least have a}} right to ask, what known process of nature can have produced it? How have these various volcanic rocks, which he sees marked as Felspathic Traps, Quartz Porphyries, Greenstones, and so forth, got intermingled with beds which <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> believe <b>are</b> volcanic ashes, and those again with fossil-bearing Silurian beds and Cambrian slates, which <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> believe <b>were</b> deposited under water?

25|$|On May 17, 1928, while {{six years}} old, Kerouac {{had his first}} Confession.

This experience, along with his dying brother's vision of the Virgin Mary (as the nuns fawned over him, {{convinced}} he was a saint), combined with a later study of Buddhism and an ongoing commitment to Christ, solidified the worldview which would inform Kerouac's work.|$|E

25|$|On December 23, 1951, Mantle married Merlyn Johnson (1932–2009) in Commerce, Oklahoma; {{they had}} four sons. In an autobiography, Mantle said he married Merlyn {{not out of}} love, but because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> by his domineering father. While his {{drinking}} became public knowledge during his lifetime, the press (per established practice at the time) kept quiet about his many marital infidelities. Mantle was not entirely discreet about them, and {{when he went to}} his retirement ceremony in 1969, he brought his mistress along with his wife. In 1980, Mickey and Merlyn separated for 15 years, but neither filed for divorce. During this time, Mantle lived with his agent, Greer Johnson, who was not related to Mantle's wife.|$|E

In the January 2007 transfer window, Aliadière was linked with a move to the Premier League club Middlesbrough in North East England, after Wenger {{said he would be}} allowed to leave the club. The move, however, failed to happen after Robin van Persie broke his foot, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> stay at Arsenal for the time being.

Fernando Alonso attempted to also pass Vettel but was unsuccessful, giving Mark Webber the opportunity to overtake Alonso on the outside of Turn 7. Both Alonso and Webber went off track as Webber completed the move. Stewards deemed Webber's move illegal and on lap seven <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> hand the position back to Alonso, which also meant letting Timo Glock through as the German had also passed Alonso on the first lap. Alonso's Renault teammate Romain Grosjean was not having any more luck, having to retire at the end of lap three with a recurring brake problem.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Carlist-controlled territory, Maroto was well {{received by the}} Pretender, who seated him on numerous occasions at his table and tried {{to give him a}} responsible command, which he was unable to accomplish because of the opposition of General Tomás de Zumalacárregui, who always had a negative view of Maroto. When Zumalacárregui was injured in Bilbao, Maroto received a direct order from Don Carlos to replace him and took command of his army. However, the written order, manipulated, was confusing and almost contradictory: Don Carlos ordered that Maroto remain in the army, but under the orders of field marshal Francisco Benito Eraso, until, for reasons of health, the latter retired from the Army of the North. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> remain patient and in the meantime to obverse the actions of said general, which could be suspicious. Maroto's serious, authentically soldierly character won him at this time the friendship and confidence {{of the members of the}} forces, especially the common soldiers.|$|E

On 19 July Hullett is thought to have taken an overdose and was found the next morning in a coma. Adams was unavailable and a colleague, Dr Harris, attended her until Adams arrived later in the day. Not once during their discussion did Adams mention her depression or her barbiturate medication. They decided a cerebral haemorrhage was most likely. On 21 July Dr Shera, a pathologist, was called in to take a spinal fluid sample and immediately asked if her stomach contents should be examined in case of narcotic poisoning. Adams and Harris both opposed this. After Shera left, Adams visited a colleague at the Princess Alice Hospital in Eastbourne and asked about the treatment for barbiturate poisoning. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> give doses of 10cc of Megimide every five minutes, and was given 100cc to use.
