40|$|While {{there is}} a wide range of {{actuation}} technologies, none currently rivals the overall performance (power density, bandwidth, stress, stroke) of conventional hydraulic actuation. It is well known in the actuation community that the power-to-weight ratios and the power-to-volume ratios of hydraulic actuators are, respectively, around 5 times and 10 to 20 times larger than comparable electric motors. Due to fundamental limitations in the magnetic flux density in the supporting structures and limitations in the heat transfer out of electric actuators, significant changes in these ratios are not likely in the near future. Thermal limitations associated with electric motors do no apply to hydraulic actuators since the hydraulic fluid cools and lubricates the system. Hydraulic actuators are capable of holding a load without any energy expenditure, resilient to high impact loads, and typically do no need a transmission system. However, with all of these virtues, hydraulic actuators have serious practical implementation problems. Typically, hydraulic actuators have moderate to poor reliability when compared to electric actuators, leaky (at least in reputation), poor energy efficiencies and poor controllability due to either overlapping or underlapping in the spool of the control valves.

The concept, fabrication, and characterization of a kinematically-stabilized polymeric microbubble actuator (¡°endoskeletal microbubble actuator¡±) were presented. A systematic design and modeling procedure was carried out to generate an optimized geometry of the corrugated diaphragm to satisfy membrane deflection, force, and stability requirements set forth by the tactile display goals. A refreshable Braille cell as a tactile display prototype has been developed based on a 2 x 3 endoskeletal microbubble array and an array of commercial valves. The prototype can provide both a static display (which meets the displacement and force requirement of a Braille display) and vibratory tactile sensations. Along with the above capabilities, the device was designed to meet the criteria of lightness and compactness to permit portable operation. The design is scalable with respect to the number of tactile actuators while still being simple to fabricate. In order to further reduce the size and cost of the tactile display, a microvalve array can be integrated into the tactile display system to control the pneumatic fluid that actuates the microbubble actuator. A piezoelectrically-driven and hydraulically-amplified polymer microvalve has been designed, fabricated, and tested. An incompressible elastomer was used as a solid <b>hydraulic</b> <b>medium</b> to convert the small axial displacement of a piezoelectric actuator into a large valve head stroke while maintaining a large blocking force.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the most important}} processes {{for the development of}} a Prototype Control System for vehicle application of the cone ring transmission. Based on a model of the cone ring transmission, it was possible to develop a closed loop control for the ratio adjustment, and also to test the driving strategies prior to the vehicle application. Enormous savings in development time are thus realized. It was possible to predict the driving behavior of the car, especially under dynamic situations, with the usage of this model. For these situations, filter and algorithms were developed for the safe functionality of the cone ring transmission. With the usage of the Rapid Prototype Platform of dSPACE and the model development in Matlab-Simulink, it was possible to implement the developed control algorithms and driving strategies in real time into a vehicle equipped with the cone ring transmission. The data evaluation from the vehicle test showed that the developed model can be used as a pre-calibration tool for vehicle application. Furthermore, this thesis demonstrates model based optimization of the ratio controls concerning the stability, the accuracy, and the response time. Due to the high bandwidth of the controller, the system is sensitive to signal disturbances, and a good sensor quality is demanded. A reduction of the Controller bandwidth without a loss in accuracy, stability, and response time can be achieved by a model based disturbances’ compensation. For this purpose, the model of the Drill torque in the contact area is used. Based on vehicle measurements and test rig data, it was possible to verify the drill torque calculation. This made it possible to simulate the ratio change under dynamic situations more precisely. Using a Drill-Torque-Map developed in the model, it was possible to integrate a feed-forward disturbances’ compensation into the control algorithms. As a result, a controller with reduced bandwidth can be used without a loss in the quality of the control. Additionally, using the model, intelligent control algorithms have been developed, reducing the number of necessary sensors in the cone ring transmission, and consequently also reducing the cost of the transmission. After the optimization of the ratio control, control algorithms for the clamping force have been designed. The clamping force control is possible through a constructive extension and a load relieving through a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>medium.</b> After testing the function of the load relieving, the algorithms of the automatic control of the clamping force during the driving operation have been programmed.

40|$|Traditionally, dynamic {{systems are}} {{equipped}} with passive technologies like viscous shock absorbers and rubber vibration isolators to attenuate disturbances. Passive elements are cost effective, simple to manufacture, and have a long life span. However, the dynamic characteristics of passive devices are fixed and tuned {{for a set of}} inputs or system conditions. Thus in many applications when variation of input or system conditions is present, sub-optimal performance is realized. The other fundamental flaw associated with passive devices is that they expel the undesired kinetic energy as heat. Recently, the introduction of electromagnetic technologies to the vibration isolation systems has provided researchers with new opportunities for realizing active/semi-active vibration isolation systems with the additional benefit of energy regeneration (in semi-active mode). Electromagnetic vibration isolators are often suffer from a couple of shortcomings that precludes their implementations in many applications. Examples of these short comings include bulky designs, low force density, high energy consumption (in active mode), and fail-safe operation problem. This PhD research aims at developing optimal hybrid-electromagnetic vibration isolation systems to provide active/semi-active and regenerative vibration isolation for various applications. The idea is to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings by integrating electromagnetic actuators, conventional damping technologies, and stiffness elements into single hybrid packages. In this research, for both semi-active and active cases, hybrid electromagnetic solutions are proposed. In the first step of this study, the concept of semi-active hybrid damper is proposed and experimentally tested that is composed of a passive hydraulic and a semi-active electromagnetic components. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>medium</b> provides a bias and fail-safe damping force while the electromagnetic component adds adaptability and energy regeneration to the hybrid design. Based on the modeling and optimization studies, presented in this work, an extended analysis of the electromagnetic damping component of the hybrid damper is presented which can serve as potent tool for the designers who seek maximizing the adaptability (and regeneration capacity) of the hybrid damper. The experimental results (from the optimized design) show that the damper is able to produce damping coefficients of 1300 and 0 - 238 Ns/m through the viscous and electromagnetic components, respectively. In particular, the concept of hybrid damping for the application of vehicle suspension system is studied. It is shown that the whole suspension system can be adjusted such that the implementation of the hybrid damper, not only would not add any adverse effects to the main functionally of the suspension, but it would also provide a better dynamics, and enhance the vehicle fuel consumption (by regenerating a portion of wasted vibration energy). In the second step, the hybrid damper concept is extended to an active hybrid electromagnetic vibration isolation systems. To achieve this target, a passive pneumatic spring is fused together with an active electromagnetic actuator in a single hybrid package. The active electromagnetic component maintains a base line stiffness and support for the system, and also provides active vibration for a wide frequency range. The passive pneumatic spring makes the system fail-safe, increases the stiffness and support of the system for larger masses and dead loads, and further guarantees a very low transmissibility at high frequencies. The FEM and experimental results confirmed the high force density of the proposed electromagnetic component, comparing to a voice coil of similar size. In the proposed design, with a diameter of ~ 125 mm and a height of ~ 60 mm, a force variation of ~ 318 N is obtained for the currents of I=± 2 A. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the proposed actuator has a small time constant (ratio of inductance to resistance for the coils) of less than 5. 2 ms, with negligible eddy current effect, making the vibration isolator suitable for wide bandwidth applications. According to the results, the active controllers are able to enhance the performance of the passive elements by up to 80 % and 95 % in terms of acceleration and force transmissibilities, respectively...|$|E

Due to the heterogeneous nature of the <b>medium</b> <b>hydraulic</b> properties of these rocks are mainly controlled by fracturing and influenced by multivariate parameters. This heterogeneity is due to various compactions, density of fractures and degree of weathering. Therefore, regarding the importance of ground water resources in social and economic development, the study of fractured rock aquifers especially in arid and semi-arid regions is of interest. In this paper zoning of aquifers {{has been carried out}} according to their potential using concept of overlaying of drastic parameters on groundwater development. Materials and Methods: The study area is located in the southwest of Marivan city, Iran. Due to the existence of sandstone and igneous formations and tectonic activities, fractured aquifers, was probably developed. In this paper, Simple Additive Weighted (SAW) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) using eigenvectors were used to find ground water resources. In order to evaluate the groundwater potential sources, lithology, fracture density, elevation, slope, aspect, drainage density and land use parameters were considered. For this purpose, layers of these information were provided in the IDRISI and GIS medium and then sorted and weighted using the weighted cumulative integrate AHP and SAW methods. The index of ground water potential sources was determined by multiplying each raster layer by its corresponding weighting factor assigned by the AHP and SAW methods.

Initial results showed that certain geophysical logs provided more information than others- most notably the 'short-normal', micro-resistivity, porosity and sonic logs provided the most information on hydraulic conductivity. The neural network produced excellent training results with accuracy of 90 percent or greater, but was unable to produce accurate predictions of the hydraulic conductivity class. The second attempt at prediction was done using a new methodology and a modified data set. The new methodology builds on the results of the first attempts at prediction by limiting the choices of geophysical logs to only those that provide significant information. Additionally, this second attempt uses a modified data set and predicts transmissivity instead of hydraulic conductivity. Results of these simulations indicate that the most informative geophysical measurements for the prediction of transmissivity are depth and sonic log. The long normal resistivity and self potential borehole logs are moderately informative. In addition, it was found that porosity and crack counts (clear, open, or hairline) do not inform predictions of hydraulic transmissivity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the sustainable performance of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) which are popularly specified as “leachate retaining” or as “water proofing” membranes in the geo-environmental construction industry. Geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) are composite matting comprising of bentonite clay with two covering geosynthetics. These are innovative labour saving construction material, {{developed over the}} last three decades. The paper outlines the variety of Geosynthetic Clay Liners (GCLs) can be classified essentially into two distinctly different forms viz; (a) air dry (< 8 % m/c) with granular or powdered bentonite or (b) bentonite cake factory prehydrated to a moisture content (~ 40 % m/c) beyond its shrinkage limit and vacuum extruded as a clay cake to enhance its sustainable performance. The dominant mineral in bentonite clay is the three-layered (2 : 1) clay mineral montmorillonite. High quality bentonites need {{to be used in the}} GCL manufacture. Sodium montmorillonite has the desired characteristic of high swelling capacity, high cation exchange capacity and the consequently very low hydraulic conductivity, providing the basis for the <b>hydraulic</b> sealing <b>medium</b> in GCLs. These encapsulate the active montmorillonite clay minerals which depend on the water and chemical balance between the sealing element and the surrounding geo environment. Quantitative mineralogical analyses and an assessment of the adsorbed cation regime, diffusion coefficients and clay leachate compatibility must necessarily be an integral part of the site appraisal to ensure acceptable long term sustainability and performance. Factors influencing the desired performance of bentonite in the GCLs placed in difficult construction and hostile chemical environments are discussed in this paper. Accordingly, the performance specifications for GCLs are identified and the appropriateness of enhancing the cation exchange capacity with polymer treatment and the need for factory prehydration of the untreated sodium bentonite is emphasised. The advantage of factory prehydrating the polymer treated bentonite to fluid content beyond its shrinkage limit and subsequently factory processing it to develop laminated clay is to develop a GCL that has enviable sealing characteristics with a greater resistance to geochemical attack and cracking. Since clay liners are buried in the ground as base liners, capping layer or as structural water proofing membrane, they can easily avoid strict quality and performance monitoring being “out of sight, out of mind!”. It is very necessary that barrier design for leachate containment must necessarily be in accordance with legislative requirement Assessment of long term hydraulic conductivities and clay-leachate compatibility assessment is deemed necessary. The derogatory factors affecting the sustainable performance of the bentonite in GCLs placed in difficult construction and hostile chemical environments are discussed. Sustainability concepts incorporated in waste management practice must aim to achieve 100 % recycling and fully implement the handling of solid waste in developing countries with relatively lower labour costs...|$|R
40|$|In the {{modelling}} of {{flow and}} transport phenomena in naturally heterogeneous media, the spatial variability of hydraulic properties, typically the hydraulic conductivity, is generally described {{by use of}} a variogram of constant sill and spatial correlation. While some analyses {{reported in the literature}} discuss of spatial inhomogeneity related to a trend in the mean hydraulic conductivity, the effect in the flow and transport due to an inexact definition of spatial statistical properties of media {{as far as we know}} had never taken into account. The relevance of this topic is manifest, and it is related to the uncertainty in the definition of spatial moments of hydraulic log-conductivity from an (usually) little number of data, as well as to the modelling of flow and transport processes by the Monte Carlo technique, whose numerical fields have poor ergodic properties and are not strictly statistically homogeneous. In this work we investigate the effects related to mean log-conductivity (logK) field behaviours different from the constant one due to different sources of inhomogeneity as: i) a deterministic trend; ii) a deterministic sinusoidal pattern and iii) a random behaviour deriving from the hierarchical sedimentary architecture of porous formations and iv) conditioning procedure on available measurements of the hydraulic conductivity. These mean log-conductivity behaviours are superimposed to a correlated weakly fluctuating logK field. The time evolution of the spatial moments of the plume driven by a statistically inhomogeneous steady state random velocity field is analyzed in a 2 -D finite domain by taking into account different sizes of injection area. The problem is approached by both a classical Monte Carlo procedure and SFEM (stochastic finite element method). By the latter the moments are achieved by space-time integration of the velocity field covariance structure derived according to the first-order Taylor series expansion. Two different goals are foreseen: 1) from the results it will be possible to distinguish the contribute in the plume dispersion of the uncertainty in the statistics of the <b>medium</b> <b>hydraulic</b> properties in all the cases considered, and 2) we will try to highlight the loss of performances that seems to affect the first-order approaches in the transport phenomena that take place in hierarchical architecture of porous formations...|$|R
40|$|Dans le domaine de la prévision des débits, une grande variété de méthodes sont disponibles: des modèles stochastiques et conceptuels mais aussi des approches plus novatrices telles que les réseaux de neurones artificiels, les modèles à base de règles floues, la méthode des k plus proches voisins, la régression floue et les splines de régression. Après avoir effectué une revue détaillée de ces méthodes et de leurs {{applications}} récentes, nous proposons une classification qui {{permet de}} mettre en lumière les différences mais aussi les ressemblances entre ces approches. Elles sont ensuite comparées pour les problèmes différents de la prévision à court, moyen et long terme. Les recommandations que nous effectuons varient aussi avec le niveau d'information a priori. Par exemple, lorsque l'on dispose de séries chronologiques stationnaires de longue durée, nous recommandons l'emploi de la méthode non paramétrique des k plus proches voisins pour les prévisions à court et moyen terme. Au contraire, pour la prévision à plus long terme à partir d'un nombre restreint d'observations, nous suggérons l'emploi d'un modèle conceptuel couplé à un modèle météorologique basé sur l'historique. Bien que l'emphase soit mise sur le problème de la prévision des débits, une grande partie de cette revue, principalement celle traitant des modèles empiriques, est aussi pertinente pour la prévision d'autres variables. A large number of models are available for streamflow forecasting. In this paper we classify and compare nine types of models for short, medium and long-term flow forecasting, according to six criteria: 1. validity of underlying hypotheses, 2. difficulties encountered when building and calibrating the model, 3. difficulties in computing the forecasts, 4. uncertainty modeling, 5. information required by each type of model, and 6. parameter updating. We first distinguish between empirical and conceptual models, the difference being that conceptual models correspond to simplified representations of the watershed, while empirical model only try to capture the structural relationships between inputs to the watershed and outputs, such as streamflow. Amongst empirical models, we distinguish between stochastic models, i. e. models based on the theory of probability, and non-stochastic models. Three types of stochastic models are presented: statistical regression models, Box-Jenkins models, and the nonparametric k-nearest neighbor method. Statistical linear regression is only applicable for long term forecasting (monthly flows, for example), since it requires independent and identically distributed observations. It is a simple method of forecasting, and its hypotheses can be validated a posteriori if sufficient data are available. Box-Jenkins models include linear autoregressive models (AR), linear moving average models (MA), linear autoregressive - moving average models (ARMA), periodic ARMA models (PARMA) and ARMA models with auxiliary inputs (ARMAX). They are more adapted for weekly or daily flow forecasting, since the yallow for the explicit modeling of time dependence. Efficient methods are available for designing the model and updating the parameters as more data become available. For both statistical linear regression and Box-Jenkins models, the inputs must be uncorrelated and linearly related to the output. Furthermore, the process must be stationary. When it is suspected that the inputs are correlated or have a nonlinear effect on the output, the k-nearest neighbor method may be considered. This data-based nonparametric approach simply consists in looking, among past observations of the process, for the k events which are most similar to the present situation. A forecast is then built from the flows which were observed for these k events. Obviously, this approach requires a large database and a stationary process. Furthermore, {{the time required to}} calibrate the model and compute the forecasts increases rapidly with the size of the database. A clear advantage of stochastic models is that forecast uncertainty may be quantified by constructing a confidence interval. Three types of non-stochastic empirical models are also discussed: artificial neural networks (ANN), fuzzy linear regression and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). ANNs were originally designed as simple conceptual models of the brain. However, for forecasting purposes, these models can be thought of simply as a subset of non linear empirical models. In fact, the ANN model most commonly used in forecasting, a multi-layer feed-forward network, corresponds to a non linear autoregressive model (NAR). To capture the moving average components of a time series, it is necessary to use recurrent architectures. ANNs are difficult to design and calibrate, and the computation of forecasts is also complex. Fuzzy linear regression makes it possible to extract linear relationships from small data sets, with fewer hypotheses than statistical linear regression. It does not require the observations to be uncorrelated, nor does it ask for the error variance to be homogeneous. However, the model is very sensitive to outliers. Furthermore, a posteriori validation of the hypothesis of linearity is not possible for small data sets. MARS models are based on the hypothesis that time series are chaotic instead of stochastic. The main advantage of the method is its ability to model non-stationary processes. The approach is non-parametric, and therefore requires a large data set. Amongst conceptual models, we distinguish between physical models, hydraulic machines, and fuzzy rule-based systems. Most conceptual hydrologic models are hydraulic machines, in which the watershed is considered to behave like a network of reservoirs. Physical modeling of a watershed would imply using fundamental physical equations at a small scale, such as the law of conservation of mass. Given the complexity of a watershed, this can be done in practice only for water routing. Consequently, only short term flow forecasts can be obtained from a physical model, since the effects of precipitation, infiltration and evaporation must be negligible. Fuzzy rule-based systems make it possible to model the water cycle using fuzzy IF-THEN rules, such as IF it rains a lot {{in a short period of}} time, THEN there will be a large flow increase following the concentration time. Each fuzzy quantifier is modeled using a fuzzy number to take into account the uncertainty surrounding it. When sufficient data are available, the fuzzy quantifiers can be constructed from the data. In general, conceptual models require more effort to develop than empirical models. However, for exceptional events, conceptual models can often provide more realistic forecasts, since empirical models are not well suited for extrapolation. A fruitful approach is to combine conceptual and empirical models. One way of doing this, called extended streamflow prediction or ESP, is to combine a stochastic model for generating meteorological scenarios with a conceptual model of the watershed. Based on this review of flow forecasting models, we recommend for short term forecasting (hourly and daily flows) the use of the k-nearest neighbor method, Box-Jenkins models, water routing models or <b>hydraulic</b> machines. For <b>medium</b> term forecasting (weekly flows, for example), we recommend the k-nearest neighbor method and Box-Jenkins models, as well as fuzzy-rule based and ESP models. For long term forecasting (monthly flows), we recommend statistical and fuzzy regression, Box-Jenkins, MARS and ESP models. It is important to choose a type of model which is appropriate for the problem at hand and for which the information available is sufficient. Each type of model having its advantages, it can be more efficient to combine different approaches when forecasting streamflow...|$|R
