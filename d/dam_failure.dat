50|$|The {{flooding}} of Fukushima {{led to the}} meltdown {{of three}} reactor cores and release of radiation so high that 100,000 citizens were forced to evacuate. Following the Fukushima disaster, the NRC prepared a report in 2011 to examine the risk that <b>dam</b> <b>failures</b> posed on the nation’s fleet of nuclear reactors. A redacted (much of the report was deleted from public review) version of NRC’s report on <b>dam</b> <b>failures</b> was posted on the NRC website on March 6.

25|$|The main {{causes of}} <b>dam</b> <b>failure</b> include {{inadequate}} spillway capacity, piping through the embankment, foundation or abutments, spillway design error (South Fork Dam), geological instability caused by changes to water levels during filling or poor surveying (Vajont, Malpasset, Testalinden Creek dams), poor maintenance, especially of outlet pipes (Lawn Lake Dam, Val di Stava Dam collapse), extreme rainfall (Shakidor Dam), earthquakes, and human, computer or design error (Buffalo Creek Flood, Dale Dike Reservoir, Taum Sauk pumped storage plant).|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} {{risk associated with}} tailings <b>dam</b> <b>failures</b> can be considerable due {{to the release of}} toxic chemicals into the environment. The extent of outflow and region of potential damage caused by tailings <b>dam</b> <b>failures</b> can be difficult to assess due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation of tailings properties and the interaction of tailings flow with the topology of the terrain. The tailings flow is modeled using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to capture the evolving nature of the flow. Due to the large number of parameters involved, a back-analysis of literature-reported <b>dam</b> <b>failures</b> was used for the testing and validation of the applicability of SPH method, with the results showing a considerable agreement with the literature-reported ones. Thus, the use of SPH simulations could enable analysis of the extent of tailings outflow for the design of future tailings facilities and to assess the potential damage arising from failure of existing ones...|$|R

25|$|On December 15, 1892, Brodie married Mary Louise Hanlon. The second Mrs. Brodie was a {{survivor}} of the Walnut Grove <b>Dam</b> <b>failure</b> who had lost her entire family during the flooding. The couple had two sons, with the first dying in 1896 and the second being born in 1898. Politically, Brodie served as Yavapai County recorder from 1893 till 1895. and was the Republican nominee for Territorial delegate in 1898, {{when he returned to}} the territory as a war hero.|$|E
25|$|Horizontal and {{vertical}} cracks formed {{along the southern}} part of the embankment, allowing the acidic tailings solution to penetrate and weaken the embankment. A sand beach was constructed to protect the face of the embankment from the tailings solution, but it was not properly maintained. Prior to the collapse, the level of the tailings solution in the holding pond had risen two feet higher than the dam's designed limit, and the sand beach no longer provided the dam protection. The United States Army Corps of Engineers concluded in its report to Governor Bruce King of New Mexico that the principal cause of failure was differential settlement of the foundation beneath the dam wall, and the report commissioned by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission corroborated this conclusion. Critical variations in tailings pond operation practice from approved procedures contributed further to the <b>dam</b> <b>failure.</b> United Nuclear's Chief Operating Officer, J. David Hann, blamed the failure of dam on the pointed shape of the bedrock beneath the embankment, which he said acted as a fulcrum and weakened the dam.|$|E
50|$|The use {{or control}} or {{distribution}} of river water in an upstream state is invariably denial of prevailing use / {{purpose in the}} downstream state as it is altering natural flow regime of river water with respect to quantity, quality and time of availability in downstream states.

40|$|In January and March 2000 two {{tailings}} <b>dam</b> <b>failures</b> in Maramure? County, northwest Romania, {{resulted in}} the release of 200, 000 m 3 of contaminated water and 40, 000 tonnes of tailings into tributaries of the Tisa River, a major tributary of the Danube. The high concentrations of cyanide and contaminant metals released by these <b>dam</b> <b>failures</b> resulted in pollution and fish deaths not only in Romania, but also downstream in the Tisa and Danube rivers within Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria. Following these accidents, a research programme was initiated in northwest Romania to establish metal levels in rivers affected by the tailings <b>dam</b> <b>failures</b> and to compare these to metal values in river systems contaminated by historic mining and industrial activity. In July 2000, 65 surface water, 65 river sediment and 45 floodplain sediment samples were collected from trunk streams and principal tributaries of the Lapu?/Some? rivers (affected by the January 2000 spill) and the Vi?eu/Tisa rivers (affected by the March 2000 Novat spill) down to the Hungarian and Ukrainian borders, respectively. Sample analyses for Pb, Zn Cu and Cd show that metal contamination in surface water and river sediment decreases rapidly downstream away from presently active mines and tailings ponds. Concentrations of heavy metals in water and sediment leaving Romania, and entering Hungary and the Ukraine, generally fall below EC imperative and Dutch intervention values, respectively. However, Zn, Cu and Cd concentrations in river sediments approach or exceed intervention values at the Romanian border. The results of this survey are compared with earlier surveys to ascertain the long-term fate and environmental significance of contaminant metals released by mine tailings <b>dam</b> <b>failures</b> in Maramure? County. Peer reviewe...|$|R
2500|$|Under the [...] "agreement state" [...] {{legislative}} {{framework of the}} Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission left New Mexico to handle the <b>dam</b> <b>failure</b> until October 12, 1979, when it was notified that the state would permit the uranium mill to resume operation that week.

50|$|On December 14, 1963, a crack {{appeared}} in the Baldwin Hills Dam impounding the Baldwin Hills Reservoir. Within a few hours, water rushing through the crack eroded the earthen dam, gradually widening the crack until the dam failed catastrophically at 3:38 pm. Although the area had been evacuated after the crack had been discovered, several homes were destroyed, and most of Baldwin Vista and the historic Village Green community were flooded. The <b>dam's</b> <b>failure</b> was ultimately determined {{to be the result}} of subsidence, caused by overexploitation of the Inglewood Oil Field. The <b>dam's</b> <b>failure</b> prompted the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power to close and drain other small local reservoirs with similar designs, such as the Silver Lake Reservoir. The Baldwin Hills Dam was not rebuilt—instead, the empty reservoir was demolished, filled with earth, landscaped, and converted to Kenneth Hahn Regional Park.|$|R
