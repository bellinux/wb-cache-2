5000|$|The eastern room {{contained}} the mill used {{to crush the}} cane to extract the sweet juice, according to Thomas Spalding [...] "the first <b>horizontal</b> <b>cane</b> mill worked by cattle power." [...] Horizontal mills were a relatively new innovation in sugar production in the 1820s, and McIntosh’s was purchased from the West Point Foundry in New York. The mill room is the only two-story room at the sugarhouse, with the mill being on the second story while the animals which powered it were below.|$|E
40|$|Tabby Sugar Works Marker, St Mary 2 ̆ 7 s GA This {{historical}} sign sits off Highway 40 - Spur near Kingsland, Ga. This park is not {{far from}} the Kings Bay Submarine Base. On the property sits the ruins of a tabby sugar mill of long ago. The text on the marker reads as : Tabby Sugar Works of John Houstoun McIntosh 2 ̆ 2 These are the ruins of a tabby sugar works built by John Houston McIntosh at New Canaan Plantation soon after 1825. In his sugar house McIntosh installed what was, according to Thomas Spalding, the first <b>horizontal</b> <b>cane</b> mill worked by cattle power. McIntosh, born in 1773 in what is now McIntosh County, settled in East Florida as a young man and became a leader of a group of American citizens who, during the War of 1812, plotted the annexation of East Florida to the United States. This plot crushed by the Spanish government, McIntosh removed to Georgia and acquired two plantations in Camden County, Marian, where he built a home, and New Canaan, where he began the cultivation of sugar cane under the influence of Thomas Spalding, who had experimented in sugar production and seen the use of steam-propelled <b>horizontal</b> <b>cane</b> mills in Louisiana. After McIntosh 2 ̆ 7 s death in 1836, New Canaan was sold to one Col. Hallowes, who changed the name of the plantation to Bollingbrook and lived there until after the Civil War. During the war, Hallowes planted cane and made sugar in the McIntosh sugar house. He also used the tabby sugar works as a starch factory, producing arrowroot starch in large quantities. 2 ̆ 2 Georgia Historical Commission 1963. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Electronic travel aids (ETAs) can {{potentially}} increase {{the safety and}} comfort of blind users by detecting and displaying obstacles outside {{the range of the}} white cane. In a series of experiments, we aim to balance the amount of information displayed and the comprehensibility of the information taking into account the risk of information overload. In Experiment 1, we investigate perception of compound signals displayed on a tactile vest while walking. The results confirm that the threat of information overload is clear and present. Tactile coding parameters that are sufficiently discriminable in isolation may not be so in compound signals and while walking and using the white <b>cane.</b> <b>Horizontal</b> tactor location is a strong coding parameter, and temporal pattern is the preferred secondary coding parameter. Vertical location is also possible as coding parameter but it requires additional tactors and makes the display hardware more complex and expensive and less user friendly. In Experiment 2, we investigate how we can off-load the tactile modality by mitigating part of the information to an auditory display. Off-loading the tactile modality through auditory presentation is possible, but this off-loading is limited and may result in a new threat of auditory overload. In addition, taxing the auditory channel may in turn interfere with other auditory cues from the environment. In Experiment 3, we off-load the tactile sense by reducing the amount of displayed information using several filter rules. The resulting design was evaluated in Experiment 4 with visually impaired users. Although they acknowledge the potential of the display, the added of the ETA as a whole also depends on its sensor and object recognition capabilities. We recommend to use not more than two coding parameters in a tactile compound message and apply filter rules {{to reduce the amount of}} obstacles to be displayed in an obstacle avoidance ETA...|$|R
6000|$|The Mpongwe {{settlements}} on the Gaboon River are neatly built, {{but without}} any attempt at fortification; {{for the most part}} each contains one family, or rather a chief and his dependants. In the larger plantation [...] "towns," [...] the abodes form a single street, ranging from 100 to 1,000 yards in length; sometimes, but rarely, there are cross streets; the direction is made to front the sea- breeze, and, if possible, to present a corner to storm-bearing Eurus. An invariable feature, like the arcaded loggie of old Venetian towns, is the Námpolo, or palaver-house, which may be described as the club-room of the village. An open hangar, like the Ikongolo or [...] "cask-house" [...] of the trading places, it is known by a fire always kept burning. The houses are cubes, or oblong squares, varying from 10 to 100 feet in length, according to the wealth and dignity of the owner; all are one-storied, and a few are raised on switch foundations. Most of them have a verandah facing the street, and a [...] "compound" [...] or cleared space in the rear for cooking and other domestic purposes. The walls are built by planting double and parallel rows of posts, the material being either bamboo or the mid-rib of a wine-giving palm (Raphia vinifera); to these uprights <b>horizontal</b> slats of <b>cane</b> are neatly lashed by means of the never-failing [...] "tie-tie," [...] bast-slips, runners, or llianas. For the more solid buildings thin [...] "Mpávo," [...] or bark slabs, are fitted in between the double posts; when coolness is required, their place is taken by mats woven with the pinnated leaves of sundry palms. This is a favourite industry with the women, who make two kinds, one coarse, the other a neat and close article, of rattan-tint until it becomes smoke-stained: the material is so cheap and comfortable, that many of the missionaries prefer it for walls to brick or boarding. The windows are mere holes in the mats to admit light, and the doors are cut with a Mpáno (adze) from a single tree trunk, which would be wilful waste if timber were ever wanting. The floor is sometimes sandy, but generally of hard and level tamped clay, to which the European would prefer boarding, and, as a rule, it is clean--no fear of pythogenie from here! The pent-shaped roof of rafters and thatch is water-tight except when the host of rats disturb it by their nocturnal gambols.|$|R
