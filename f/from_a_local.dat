The accusation in 1934 stemmed from a letter police found <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>local</b> Communist official that alleged that Cagney would bring other Hollywood stars to meetings. Cagney denied this, and Lincoln Steffens, husband of the letter's writer, backed up this denial, asserting that the accusation stemmed solely from Cagney's donation to striking cotton workers in the San Joaquin Valley. William Cagney claimed this donation was the root of the charges in 1940. Cagney was cleared by U.S. Representative Martin Dies Jr., on the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E

At the time Cincinnati was the major town in the area and subsequent map makers used the Barnum map as their primary source. Consequently, most maps of Jeffersonville from 1837 to about 1852 are in error.|$|E

5|$|Ports use Makefile to {{automatically}} fetch the desired application's source code, either <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>local</b> or remote repository, unpack {{it on the}} system, apply patches to it and compile it.

Most ports also have package counterparts (i.e. pre-compiled binaries), giving the user a choice. Although this method is faster, the user has fewer customisation options.|$|E
