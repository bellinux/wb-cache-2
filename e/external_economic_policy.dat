40|$|This {{paper is}} very much a {{preliminary}} stab at the further development of work already undertaken by the author on the <b>external</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> of the EU and the EU's role as an international actor.

It focuses on the formation of EU policies within the 'triad' or the 'triangle' of EU/US/Japan relations, and assesses contrasting approaches to the structures, actions and interactions which characterise them. The conclusion is that conventional 'state-referential' or quasi-mercantilist notions of foreign <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> in the EU context need to be viewed critically and in the light of a changing world economy best exemplified by the relations between the EU and its major industrial and commercial partners.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the EU arms embargo on China as a case-study, analysing the apparent paradox of the EU’s foreign and <b>economic</b> <b>external</b> <b>policy</b> mechanisms internally and the American {{involvement in the}} EU’s foreign and <b>economic</b> <b>external</b> <b>policy</b> with regard to China. The thesis firstly introduces {{the uniqueness of the}} Chinese arms embargo in contrast to the other 22 arms embargoes issued in EU’s history. In terms of the case-study, the EU’s arms embargo on China did not become a key contentious issue until the initial moves by the EU Commission to lift it surfaced in 2004. The analysis of the EU foreign and <b>economic</b> <b>external</b> <b>policies</b> towards China and the arms embargo focuses on the political, legal, and economic foundations of EC/EU policy and seeks to offer explanations of the evolution of events at EU institutional level, the EU member states’ level, and the wider international level. The thesis {{examines the}} evolution of the EC/EU – Chinese relationship. It also examines how the key political issue of the embargo eventually came to become a technical matter, which lost some of its importance to the Chinese. In this evolution, the thesis picks up on Chinese scholars’ fascination with the EU – the relationship between its institutions, and the member states relationship with each other and the EU institutions with regard to the arms embargo. It notes that some Chinese scholars have seen the EU as a potential role model for the developments in China and the region of Asia. The thesis notes the role of the outsider player, the United States of America, which influenced the making and implementation of foreign and <b>economic</b> <b>external</b> <b>policy</b> of the EU. The thesis proves that China is fully aware of the continuous influence exerted by the US onto the EU-Chinese relationship. In sum, the arms embargo is an ideal test case to examine: a) the evolution of the EU’s coherence, consistency and independence and b) the evolution of Chinese thinking about the EU model.

Estonia has developed public enterprises of the central state and of the municipalities since the reestablishment of the Estonian Republic. As public enterprise use private forms of law, some management problems occur because public firms are legally obliged to practice the management by objectives. The operationalization of welfare maximisation or achievement of sustainability of society to formulate goals for public enterprises was yet not successful. However, public firms should increase income, avoid monopoly positions of private firms, provide special public services, and should realize public goals. The activities of Estonian public enterprises and their goals show that Estonian enterprises {{can be used as}} instruments for foreign trade. The authors formulate a simple two-country model comprising a small and a big country. They introduce a public interest function referring to production, demand and employment, which allows the authors to argue that under conditions of shrinking population, the small country’s public interests, becomes reduced. They show that employing public enterprises diminishes negative effects on public interests. Even some types of inefficient public firms may lead to improvements...|$|R

One of the major consequences of globalization is the growing interconnection among markets and, consequently, the growing interdependence of the four main international economic policies: in trade, in competition, in the supervision and regulation of international financial markets, and in monetary relations. With the exception of Europe, leading players of the global system are sovereign states, including the BRICS, for which the policy coordination issue arises only in terms of national interest and national institutions.

Taken as a whole, the countries of the European Union are the principal donors to the region, but the lack of an overall strategy, dispersion, and a lack of coordination of bilateral policies has reduced their effectiveness and the weight given cooperation in relations dominated by trade negotiations and financial issues.

40|$|From the Introduction]. The {{boundaries}} between diplomacy and <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> are being redefined {{as a result}} of the growing interdependency in the international political economy. Those boundaries have also been altered by the recent encompassing swing to democracy in regions affected by internal and <b>external</b> <b>economic</b> crises. <b>Policy</b> elites are attempting to coordinate macroeconomic and foreign policy within and between regions and subregions, as a way of enhancing their capabilities for carrying out economic and political restructuring. The search for greater policy effectiveness and stronger democracies has rendered necessary to introduce institutional reforms in decision making structures, at the national as well as at the supranational level. In spite of recent developments, the institutional frameworks for international cooperation are still quite tentative. At a normative level, the incipient attention to principles of international distributive justice may be taken as an indication. Some think that to the extent that citizens of rich countries have obligations towards the welfare of people in other countries, a new basis for international morality appears to be necessary. "The state-centered image of the world has lost its normative relevance because of the rise of global economic interdependence" (Beitz 1988 : 48). How can basic rights in all countries be institutionalized and protected? Some argue for the desirability of a constitutional world democracy and an elected world government (Nielsen 1988 : 270 - 271). But experience shows that attempts to institute almost any form of supranational authority have confronted the unwillingness of national actors to subordinate their particular interests to collective goals. The European and the Latin American experiences indicate that the speed at which integration schemes have progressed [...] and their scope [...] have been seriously constrained by the resistance to transfer sovereign powers away from the domestic spheres of decision making. The conviction that flaws in the progress towards regional unity were in part due to the architecture of integration has recently led to treaty amendments, adjustments in interinstitutional relations and a series of other institutional innovations...|$|R
40|$|The {{contents}} of this thesis examine British {{management of the}} sterling area between 1950 and 1958, covering the period between the devaluation of sterling in 1949 {{and the establishment of}} sterling convertibility in 1958. The main body of the thesis is comprised of five chapters which analyze different aspects of the sterling area system during this period. Long term lending from the UK to the overseas sterling area is examined with the conclusion that these capital flows were not a major drain on the British economy. The mechanics of movements in British short term liabilities {{to the rest of the}} sterling area are described and their effects on the British foreign exchange reserves is found to be positive or neutral for most of the period although the basis for this erodes as the decade draws to a close. The trade pattern of the sterling area members is analyzed and the changing policies to coordinate the trade of the area are described. The possibility that the existence of the sterling area inhibited the freedom of policy choices faced by the British authorities is explored with the conclusion that the major opportunities for a new direction in British <b>external</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> were abandoned for reasons other than the sterling area system. Finally, some possible alternatives to the sterling area system are analyzed and the thesis concludes that these were not plausible alternatives given the historical context in which economic policy decisions were made. The general conclusion of the thesis is that the sterling area system as it functioned in the 1950 s was not the major burden or destabilizing factor for the British economy that contemporary observers and some current research have suggested...|$|E
40|$|In the mid 1990 s, the European Union (EU) {{abandoned}} its legal defence of the Lomé Convention, which had governed EU relations with European former colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (the ACP countries) since 1975. In its place, the EU proposed {{a series of}} comprehensive regional free trade agreements – the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) – which went far beyond the requirements of WTO rules in their scope. In this thesis, I aim to add to existing understandings of the EPAs by explaining (a) why the EU sought to recast the EU-ACP relationship {{in the form of}} ambitious interregional free trade agreements; and (b) why the EU was able to achieve only limited and uneven success in reaching agreements that matched these aims. In order to address these questions, I develop a theoretical approach that combines insights from constructivist and historical institutionalisms. I aim to contribute to existing constructivist approaches by (a) investigating the emergence of complexity and contradiction within policy outputs over time; and (b) exploring the role of strategic appeals to institutional constraints in persuasive discourse. I use this theoretical approach to draw analytical linkages between the internal processes through which EU external economic projections are formed and their external reach. Specifically, I highlight the emergence of a range of contradictions within the EU’s approach to the EPA negotiations and explore the role of these contradictions in facilitating the contestation of the EPAs by actors from across the ACP regions and particularly from the case study region, SADC-minus. Overall, I argue that the EU’s <b>external</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> aims and tools are the product of the strategic actions of purposive actors working within the context of path-dependent institutional structures and patterns of past relations with the outside world. In this context, the reach and limitations of EU external economic actions are contingent upon the historical processes through which they are constructed and the understandings, strategies and alternatives that external partners bring to the table. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} internationalisation {{and integration}} of global economic activity has meant that the way nations seek to manage and accommodate such external imperatives is a critical determinant of national economic welfare. There has, however, been a notable variety of responses to these ubiquitous forces. In Australia, neoliberal ideas came to exert a powerful ideational influence over policy-makers during the 1980 s as they attempted to reposition 'Australia' {{in response to the}} exigencies of external competition. This thesis will argue that Australian policy makers' commitment to neoliberal ideas meant that policy was constructed within a limited set of theoretical parameters, which were unable to take account of the specific corporate and governmental practices of major trading partners. The thesis analyses the utility and effect of neoliberal ideas on the conduct of Australia's international economic relations, with particular reference to Japan. Japan is Australia's principal trading partner, an important potential source of investment capital, and the dominant economic actor in a region with which Australian policymakers seek greater 'integration'. This important economic relationship provides an appropriate case study with which to test the efficacy of the neoliberal model and the assumptions that inform it. It will be demonstrated that some of the central concepts and assumptions of neo-classical theory, which are central to the discourse of neoliberalism, bear little resemblance to commercial practices in the region of which Australia is a part. In the course of this study, it will be argued that the dominance of neoliberal ideas may be best understood by considering their discursive influence, particularly as this was reinforced by an influential group of academics and government officials. The theoretical assumptions of these ideas will be examined, and the preconditions that rendered them attractive at a specific historical juncture detailed. It will be suggested that neoliberal ideas informed a specific political rationality which had discernible effects on a range of policy issues in Australia, but which was especially evident in the area of <b>external</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy...</b>|$|E

The same tools make it possible to conduct policy analysis within a general equilibrium framework. Based on the generalized Salter-Swan framework and macroeconomic data for Indonesia, the author shows how to process a social accounting matrix, specify and calibrate the model, and run simulations. The results replicate welfare and structural effects of shocks and policies consistent with the underlying conceptual framework. They also reveal the key role played by structural parameters, such as the elasticity of export transformation and that of import substitution, in determining the extent of structural adjustment to shocks and the relevance of the <b>policy</b> response. <b>Economic</b> Theory&Research,Environmental Economics&Policies,Payment Systems&Infrastructure,Labor Policies,Fiscal&Monetary Policy,Economic Theory&Research,Environmental Economics&Policies,Economic Stabilization,Inequality,TF 054105 -DONOR FUNDED OPERATION ADMINISTRATION FEE INCOME AND EXPENSE ACCOUNT...|$|R
