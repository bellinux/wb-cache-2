5|$|In 1865, Agneta met Jacob Cornelis van Marken, {{known as}} Jacques, who studied {{technology}} and {{sociology at the}} Polytechnical School of Delft, a precursor of the Delft University of Technology. During his studies he took a study tour to Austria-Hungary and found a new method of producing yeast, which fascinated him. Later, {{when he heard a}} baker in Delft complain about the varying quality and poor availability of yeast in the Netherlands, <b>he</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> method which he learnt during his tour, and decided to produce industrial baker's yeast of consistently high quality.|$|E
5|$|There are varying tales {{as to the}} {{inspiration}} for Deere to create the invention he is famed for, the steel plow. In one version <b>he</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> way the polished steel pitchfork tines moved through hay and soil and thought that the same effect could be obtained for a plow. By early 1838, Deere completed his first steel plow and sold it to a local farmer, Lewis Crandall. Crandall spread word of his success with Deere's plow quickly, and two neighbors soon placed orders with Deere. By 1841 he was manufacturing 75 plows per year, and 100 plows per year in 1876.|$|E
5|$|In 1640 Charles {{attempted}} {{again to}} enforce his authority, opening a second Bishops' War. <b>He</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> English Parliament, {{known as the}} Short Parliament, but disbanded it after it declined to vote a new subsidy and was critical of his policies. He assembled a poorly provisioned and poorly trained army. The Scots moved south into England, forcing a crossing of the Tyne at Newburn {{to the west of}} Newcastle-upon-Tyne, then occupying the city and eventually most of Northumbria and Durham. This gave them a stranglehold on the vital coal supply to London. Charles was forced to capitulate, agreeing to most of the Covenanter's demands and paying them £830 a month to support their army. This forced him to recall the English Parliament, known as the Long Parliament, which, in exchange for concessions, raised the sum of £200,000 to be paid to the Scots under the Treaty of Ripon. The Scots army returned home triumphant. The king's attempts to raise a force in Ireland to invade Scotland from the west prompted a widespread revolt there and as the English moved to outright opposition that resulted in the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, he was facing rebellion in all three of his realms.|$|E

25|$|Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell: Senator Byrd {{combined}} a {{devotion to}} the U.S. Constitution with a deep learning of history to defend the interests of his state and {{the traditions of the}} Senate. We will remember him for his fighter's spirit, his abiding faith, and for the many times <b>he</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> Senate to its purposes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of the boy who said <b>he</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> life of someone who had been shot, the sister of the {{deceased}} told Stevenson that her brother had shot himself in the throat. The boy had shown Stevenson a birthmark on his throat. Stevenson suggested that he might also have a birthmark {{on the top of his}} head, representing the exit wound, and found one there underneath the boy's hair.|$|E
25|$|The Labour Party chose {{author and}} {{broadcaster}} John O'Farrell as its candidate on 12 February. Having received {{during the campaign}} negative coverage of selected quotations from a book he wrote in 1998, in which <b>he</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> Brighton bomb attacks against the Conservative Party and then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, O'Farrell reflected after polling day that the experience was enough to put him off electoral politics for good.|$|E

25|$|When Ritchie {{passed the}} first MiG-21, <b>he</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> {{engagement}} of May 10 {{and waited to}} see if there was a trailing MiG. When he observed the second MiG, which he also passed headon, he reversed hard left to engage. The Mig turned to its right to evade the attack, an unusual maneuver, and Ritchie used a vertical separation move to gain position on its rear quarter. DeBellevue obtained a solid boresight (dogfighting radar lock) on it while at the MiG's 5 o'clock; although fired from the edge of their flight envelopes, both AIM-7s struck home.|$|E
25|$|Though Umar did {{not place}} {{as much an}} {{emphasis}} on expanding the Empire's borders as his predecessors had, he was not passive. Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari states that he sent Ibn Hatim ibn al-Nu'man to repel Turks invading Azerbaijan. He faced a Kharijite uprising and preferred negotiations to armed conflict, personally holding talks with two Kharijite envoys shortly before his death. <b>He</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> troops besieging Constantinople led by his cousin Maslama. The Second Arab siege of Constantinople had failed to take the city and was sustaining heavy losses {{at the hands of}} allied Byzantine and Bulgarian forces. Its defeat was a serious blow to Umayyad prestige.|$|E
25|$|By that time, Ion Luca Caragiale became remarkably {{close to}} a new {{generation}} of ethnic Romanian intellectuals in Austria-Hungary. In 1909, <b>he</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> union of the two Danubian Principalities under Alexander John Cuza, and predicted the union of Transylvania with Romania. He visited Budapest to meet with Transylvanian students at the local university, and {{was the subject of a}} PhD thesis authored by Horia Petra-Petrescu (which was also the first monograph on his work). He decided to support the poet and activist Octavian Goga, who, after questioning ethnic policies in Transleithania, had been jailed by Hungarian authorities—writing for Universul, Caragiale stressed that such persecutions carried the risk of escalating tensions in the region. Later, he visited Goga in Szeged, where he was serving time in jail.|$|E

25|$|Stevenson's Reincarnation and Biology: A Contribution to the Etiology of Birthmarks and Birth Defects (1997), {{examined}} {{two hundred}} cases of birth defects or birthmarks on children claiming past-life memories. These included children with malformed or missing fingers {{who said they}} recalled {{the lives of people}} who had lost fingers; a boy with birthmarks resembling entrance and exit wounds who said <b>he</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> life of someone who had been shot; and a child with a scar around her skull three centimetres wide who said she recalled the life {{of a man who had}} had skull surgery. In many of the cases, in Stevenson's view, the witness testimony or autopsy reports appeared to support the existence of the injuries on the deceased's body.|$|E
25|$|Jacques {{moved to}} Buenos Aires to give free physics lectures, {{but these were}} not popular. With Alfredo Cosson, he {{traveled}} to Rosario and Entre Rios to produce daguerreotypes. In 1854, now-president Urquiza appointed him director of the land registry. He lived briefly in Córdoba and spent several years in Santiago del Estero, where he was married. He became the official surveyor of the province and conducted an expedition down the Salado River into Chaco. He also continued {{to work as a}} baker, and even thought of becoming a sugarcane planter. An account of his expedition, Excursion ou Rio Salado et dans le Chaco, was published in Paris in 1857. In it, <b>he</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> events he had witnessed, including descriptions of the scenery and the customs of local people.|$|E
25|$|The {{college was}} opened on 29 September 1852 with 98 {{students}} enrolled, rising to 125 on 1 October 1852. The opening ceremony once again involved a military parade. The Lieutenant-Governor and the States of Jersey again {{assembled in the}} Temple, and processed to the Great Hall where the Bailiff addressed the audience. <b>He</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> Royal visit of 1846 and stated that the intention of memorialising that visit had inspired {{the construction of a}} college for the instruction of youth and of promenades for the recreation of the public. He stated that the interest shown by the Queen and the Prince in the college had led them to present two portraits. The Lieutenant-Governor then formally presented the portraits of the royal couple which were unveiled. The quality of the portraits, copies of Winterhalter, was criticised in the press.|$|E

25|$|In January 1871, Martí {{embarked}} on the steam ship Guipuzcoa, which took him from Havana to Cádiz. He settled in Madrid in a guesthouse in Desengaño St. #10. Arriving {{at the capital}} he contacted fellow Cuban Carlos Sauvalle, who had been deported to Spain a year before Martí and whose house served as a center of reunions for Cubans in exile. On March 24, Cádiz’s newspaper La Soberania Nacional, published Martí's article “Castillo” in which <b>he</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> sufferings of a friend he met in prison. This article would be reprinted in Sevilla’s La Cuestión Cubana and New York’s La República. At this time, Martí registered himself {{as a member of}} independent studies in the law faculty of the Central University of Madrid. While studying here, Martí openly participated in discourse on the Cuban issue, debating through the Spanish press and circulating documents protesting Spanish activities in Cuba.|$|E
25|$|After a brief stay at Asti where Henry {{intervened in}} the {{political}} affairs in the town, much {{to the consternation of}} the Italian Guelphs, Henry proceeded to Milan, where he was crowned King of Italy with the Iron Crown of Lombardy on January 6, 1311. The Tuscan Guelphs refused to attend the ceremony, and began preparing for resistance to Henry’s imperial dreams. As part of his program of political rehabilitation, <b>he</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> Visconti, the ousted former rulers of Milan from exile. Guido della Torre, who had thrown the Visconti out of Milan, objected and organised a revolt against Henry that was ruthlessly put down, and the Visconti were returned to power, with Henry appointing Matteo I Visconti as the Imperial vicar of Milan. He also imposed his brother-in-law, Amadeus of Savoy, as the vicar-general in Lombardy. These measures, plus a massive levy imposed on the Italian towns, caused the Guelph cities to turn against Henry, and he encountered further resistance when he sought to enforce imperial claims on what had become communal lands and rights, and attempted to replace communal regulations with imperial laws. Nevertheless, Henry managed to restore some semblance of imperial power in parts of northern Italy. Cities such as Parma, Lodi, Verona and Padua all accepted his rule.|$|E
500|$|... 'Bagga' Barnes {{was also}} Bill's room-mate, and his affection for his late lamented pal, a lovable rogue, was obvious. <b>He</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> furore over Barnes's provocative field positioning, {{extremely}} close at silly mid-on, and how {{criticism of his}} foot being {{too close to the}} mown pitch prompted him to plonk his boot a couple of feet into the forbidden territory – and a couple of feet more when the English crowd roared at him.|$|E

500|$|The wing rarely saw enemy {{aircraft}} for {{the remainder}} of the year. Only on 1 January 1945 did the Germans appear in large numbers, during Operation Bodenplatte to support their faltering attack in the Ardennes. Johnson witnessed the German attack his wing's airfield at Brussels–Melsbroek. <b>He</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> Germans seemed inexperienced and their shooting was [...] "atrocious". Johnson led a Spitfire patrol to prevent a second wave of German aircraft attacking but engaged no enemy aircraft, since there was no follow-up attack. From late January and through most of February, Johnson reduced his flying time.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the late}} 20th-century writers who {{acknowledged}} Tzara as an inspiration are Jerome Rothenberg, Isidore Isou and Andrei Codrescu. The former Situationist Isou, whose experiments with sounds and poetry come {{in succession to}} Apollinaire and Dada, declared his Lettrism {{to be the last}} connection in the Charles Baudelaire-Tzara cycle, with the goal of arranging [...] "a nothing [...] for the creation of the anecdote." [...] For a short period, Codrescu even adopted the pen name Tristan Tzara. <b>He</b> <b>recalled</b> <b>the</b> impact of having discovered Tzara's work in his youth, and credited him with being [...] "the most important French poet after Rimbaud." ...|$|E

I responded, 'Well, Dr. Freud, I start where you leave off. You meet people in the artificial setting of your office. I meet them {{on the street and}} in their homes, in their natural surroundings. You analyze their dreams. I give them the courage to dream again. You analyze and tear them apart. I let them act out their conflicting roles and help them to put the parts back together again.'" ...|$|E
