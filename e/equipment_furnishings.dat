50|$|One of {{the main}} {{buildings}} in the museum collection is its general store, Amos Straw Country Store, a fine Greek Revival structure with a meeting hall {{on the second floor}} constructed in the 1850s. Connected with the store is a large center aisle threshing floor-type barn used for exhibition of artifacts. There are five buildings {{at the site of the}} National Register of Historic Places. Other buildings in the collection include the William Durgin House and ell (1813), Durgin Barn, Letterpress Printing Shop, One-Room Schoolhouse (Replica of the 1839 Fenderson Schoolhouse, Parsonsfield), an 1870s Cider Mill, Johnathan Pike Cooperage, Granary, Hands-On History Building, Tom Flagg Smithy (moved from Lincolnville, ME), and others. Also, in the collection, is an 1894 Armitage-Herschell carousel, housed in a round barn structure representative of the tent once used when the carousel was set-up at an amusement at public gatherings in York and Cumberland counties, ME, from 1896-1922), and a collection of 1850s -1920s artifacts that include: carriages, sleighs, agricultural equipment, early gas engines, tractors, trades tools and equipment, medical instruments and <b>equipment,</b> <b>furnishings,</b> store merchandise, and more.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to outline what a hotel management contract is, the main challenges arising, and why it is a particularly rich research context. The separation between ownership and management through a hotel management contract has become relatively widespread [1] and is seen as one of the driving mechanisms for the rapid internationalization of the hotel industry [2]. A hotel management contract enables a hotel owner to retain legal ownership of the hotel site, building, plant and <b>equipment,</b> <b>furnishings</b> and inventories, while the operator is responsible for the day to day business of the hotel [3]. The owner assumes full economic risk associated with ownership of the commercial asset, whereas, the operator is only responsible for the operation of the hotel [4]. Much of the reason for the popularity of management contracts is that the expertise required to operate a large hotel is more readily available under such an arrangement [5]. It enables a hotel owne...|$|E
40|$|Research {{shows that}} poor {{indoor air quality}} in school {{buildings}} can cause {{a reduction in the}} students' performance assessed by short term computer based tests; whereas good air quality in classrooms can enhance children's concentration and also teachers' productivity. Investigation of air quality in classrooms helps us to characterise pollutant levels and implement corrective measures. Outdoor pollution, ventilation <b>equipment,</b> <b>furnishings,</b> and human activities affect indoor air quality. In school classrooms the occupancy density is high (1. 8 to 2. 4 m(2) /person) compared to offices (10 m(2) /person). Ventilation systems expend energy and there is a trend to save energy by reducing ventilation rates. We need to establish the minimum acceptable level of fresh air required for the health of the occupants. This paper describes a project which will aim to investigate the effect of indoor air quality and ventilation rates on pupils' performance and health using psychological tests. The aim is to recommend suitable ventilation rates for classrooms and examine the suitability of the air quality guidelines for classrooms...|$|E
40|$|The {{replacement}} of institutional residential services {{for people with}} severe intellectual disability with community-based alternatives has progressed similarly {{in many of the}} countries of the developed world. In the first wave of reform, the idea of reversing institutional conditions provided a design brief for the alternative services which emphasised various structural characteristics of the settings: smallness of scale, typical housing design, homelike <b>equipment,</b> <b>furnishings</b> and decor, community location in typical residential areas, autonomy over household management and increased staff support. As the poor quality of existing services was widely seen as due to “institutionalisation”, there was an equally wide-spread belief that such reforms would lead automatically to high quality outcome. However, expectations for improved quality from the initial reforms, while partially met, were far from fully confirmed by research evidence. A decent, homelike, well located, reasonably staffed environment may be a necessary condition for good outcome, but these factors are not sufficient to guarantee it. The existing metaphor of institutionalisation needs further elaboration {{if it is to be}} useful, and the design brief for the alternative service requires expansion to include factors such as the orientation of staff and their working methods and training, which are shown by the research literature on the micro-organisation of settings to make a difference. Based on a review of the literature which inevitably but not exclusively favours British research on community alternatives to institutional care, the paper shows how the quality of staff and resident activity is dependent on an interaction between the structure, orientation and procedures followed within the setting...|$|E

Investigation of air quality in classrooms helps us to characterise pollutant levels and implement corrective measures. Outdoor pollution, ventilation <b>equipment,</b> <b>furnishings,</b> and human activities affect IAQ.

We need to establish the minimum acceptable level of fresh air required for the health of the occupants. This paper describes a project, which will aim to investigate the effect of IAQ and ventilation rates on pupils' performance and health using psychological tests. The aim is to recommend suitable ventilation rates for classrooms and examine the suitability of the air quality guidelines for classrooms. The air quality, ventilation rates and pupils' performance in classrooms will be evaluated in parallel measurements. In addition, Visual Analogue Scales will be used to assess subjective perception of the classroom environment and SBS symptoms. Pupil performance will be measured with Computerised Assessment Tests (CAT), and Pen and Paper Performance Tasks while physical parameters of the classroom environment will be recorded using an advanced data logging system. A total number of 20 primary schools in the Reading area are expected to participate in the present investigation, and the pupils participating in this study will be within the age group of 9 - 11 years. On completion of the project, based oil the overall data recommendations for suitable ventilation rates for schools will be formulated. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|On the 10 th of October 1881 the Brisbane, a large, {{modern and}} well {{equipped}} steamship carrying passengers and cargo struck Fish Reef, approximately 25 nautical miles from Port Darwin, and became permanently stranded. What followed {{over the next}} three months was an organised salvage programme in which the ship was salvaged of cargo, equipment and fittings. These goods were sold to Port Darwin locals through a series of auctions. The wreck provided a wide selection of second-hand goods to a small isolated community. Approximately one hundred years later locals return to this wreck to take objects they considered of value. This thesis is a case study in material culture salvage and reuse of material from the Brisbane. Local men purchased the wreck in 1881 and presided over an extensive salvage programme in which maritime technical equipment and a range of other <b>equipment,</b> <b>furnishings</b> and fittings were removed, sold and reused. Some items were not salvaged and were left on the wreck site, these being visible today. The decision of salvors to not reuse some machinery and equipment challenges broad assumptions that isolated pioneer settlements, with poor access to goods, without fail practiced full scale salvage and reuse out of necessity. This thesis examines what was taken, why it was selected and how it was used. Recent cases of salvage in which objects are valued as historic ornaments are analysed in detail to demonstrate that there is no consensus to either the historic value of this wreck or its objects. Analysing the kinds of qualities attributed to historic ornaments, identifying them for example as antiquities or curios, reflect different ways in which people engage with the past. A comparison of salvage in 1881 to that more recent shows change in how salvage and reuse have functioned as social mechanisms. This thesis emphasises that object transformations may not involve physical modification, and that object meaning is relevant to a specific time and place...|$|E
