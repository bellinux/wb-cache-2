5|$|Jermaine, Manuel and I {{sat down}} and Jermaine {{programmed}} the drums. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> feel I wanted and Manuel {{put his hands on}} the keyboards and I started singing the melody. We went back and forth with the bridge and the B-section. I had the outline of the lyrics and started singing 'Always be my baby' {{off the top of my}} head.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> {{ship was}} sinking, {{and that he}} had better take his chances in the open. He refused however, to do so and, not being strong enough to carry him, I had to leave him to his fate.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the single}} was shot on March 15, 2010 in the deserts of Lancaster, California, {{directed}} by Hype Williams. When talking to 'MTV News' about the video Minaj stated, [...] "I didn't want to shoot the typical new-artist vision. Thank God I have a wonderful label that stands behind me and my vision. I met Hype in a freakin' airport...and {{it happened to be}} a week before I wanted to shoot a video. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> idea. Of course, I had to let Baby and Slim know and hope they would understand my expensive taste. It all came together." [...] It's just beautiful — the clothes, everything. The ambiance..It's for all the girls that like to play dress-up. They're gonna love this one...we get on the walkie-talkie, like, 'Mayday! Mayday!' It's really fashion and beauty shots, and we're acting like we're doing something important. We wanted to make it pretty in the dirt. We wanted to have a very crazy contrast. I didn't want to do everything clean. I like the dirt. All that pink stuff looks even prettier in the dirt." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> how <b>the</b> {{soldiers}} in Bavaria hated the military service.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> when <b>the</b> sailor had had {{speech with}} me, and again {{repeated}} the message.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> in <b>the</b> {{smallest}} detail. I showed <b>him</b> <b>the</b> draughtsman's sketch {{with the}} distances marked plainly upon it.|$|R
2500|$|Norman Yardley was bowling to me and, on {{a perfect}} pitch, {{he had been}} unable to make a single ball do anything. When Ian Johnson came in <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> ball was not turning an inch. He plunged his left leg down the wicket, missed and was l.b.w. first ball. It had turned nearly a foot! ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{always wanted}} to have fun and was pretty much a comedian when I pitched. I {{did a lot of}} crazy things. [...] One time I went up to bat without a bat ... I {{always wanted to}} have fun playing {{baseball}} [...] that got me into trouble with Mel Ott ... I knew I wasn't going to last long with him. [...] Ott came out to the mound and said [...] "When {{are you going to get}} serious? When I sent you out here I wanted you to work." [...] <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> only way I would work [...] a rake and a shovel [...] I came out here to play ... I was in the minor leagues soon after that." [...] – Interview with Rick Van Blair ...|$|E
2500|$|The UN Security Council {{passed a}} {{resolution}} on 8 January 2009 calling for an immediate ceasefire to the hostilities in the Gaza Strip. It passed 14–0–1, with one abstention from the United States. Olmert told reporters, [...] " [...] was left shamed. A resolution that she prepared and arranged, {{and in the end}} she did not vote in favor. In the night between Thursday and Friday, when the Secretary of State wanted to lead the vote on a ceasefire at the Security Council, we did not want her to vote in favor. I said 'get me President Bush on the phone'. They said he {{was in the middle of}} giving a speech in Philadelphia. I said I didn't care. 'I need to talk to him now'. He got off the podium and spoke to me. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> United States could not vote in favor. It cannot vote in favor of such a resolution. He immediately called the Secretary of State and told her not to vote in favor." [...] When asked about the comments, a White House spokesman said that Olmert's version of events was [...] "inaccurate".|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of <b>the</b> quarrel, {{and of how}} Josephine {{had looked}} and talked when she showed me her cheek.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of <b>the</b> fire, {{and said}} {{that it might not}} be much, but that we thought we'd better waken him.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of <b>the</b> {{loss of the}} brooch, {{and said}} that Laura {{had gone into the}} {{plantation}} to look for it.|$|R
6000|$|I took Sergeant Daw {{into the}} study, {{so that we}} should be alone when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> news. It {{surprised}} even his iron self-control when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> method of the waking. I was myself surprised in turn by his first words: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{hesitated a}} little, but I {{could not help}} myself, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> whole story from {{beginning}} to end.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> utmost I {{should allow}} {{would be an}} {{exchange}} now and then when my curates were overdone,' said Mr. Parsons.|$|E
6000|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>the</b> {{commodore}} felt {{convinced the}} enemy would advance sooner than was generally believed, {{and he said}} in a tone of admiration: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{at least}} Jabez thinks, Prince," [...] and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> how <b>the</b> Israelites were {{sure that he}} would be Pharaoh, whereat he laughed and said: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} {{one man who}} used to think I couldn't do wrong; everything I did was right to 'im; and now if I pass <b>'im</b> in <b>the</b> street he makes a face as if he'd got a hair in 'is mouth. All because <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>'im</b> <b>the</b> truth one day when {{he was thinking of}} getting married. Being a bit uneasy-like in his mind, he asked me 'ow, supposing I was a gal, his looks would strike me.|$|R
60|$|So he {{went over}} to my house in his dog-cart with the retriever; and on the way <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> story of Garm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. And <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> {{accident}} wasn't Zeb's fault, {{that the}} train didn't whistle or ring, {{and that the}} crossing was a blind one." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{think he}} swore, I am sure he groaned distressfully when I {{went out with}} what was due to me. Meeting Harry <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> story.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> truth. The dinner I {{described}} (principally {{coming out}} of tins and bottles, to be sure) was the dinner we were to eat.|$|R
60|$|Bun. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>the</b> {{foolish and}} ignorant had most need of {{teaching}} and information; and, therefore, it would be profitable {{for me to go}} on in that work.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of <b>the</b> {{picture that}} Ayesha had shown {{me in the}} water; {{the picture of a}} king dying in a hut and of two who watched his end.|$|R
60|$|As we went <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of the}} story--the Angela part. He {{laid down}} his {{portmanteau}} {{and looked at me}} like an owl through his glasses.|$|E
60|$|I had but {{one answer}} {{to make to}} that appeal. Without a moment's {{hesitation}} <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> truth, as unreservedly as I have told it in these pages.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> true {{tale of a}} race-full of ball {{bearings}} strewn four miles along a Hampshire road, and by me recovered in detail. He was profoundly touched.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> then <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> {{whole story}} of my {{connection}} with the island, and of the unfortunate results of the contact between these poor people and our superior modern civilization.|$|R
6000|$|He offer'd it with downcast look, [...] As {{fearful that}} I might refuse it; [...] <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> when <b>the</b> gift <b>I</b> took, [...] My only fear should be, to lose it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where do {{you keep}} your money?" [...] he asked me, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>the</b> greater part of it--all but some pocket-money--was stowed away in an inside pocket of my vest.|$|R
6000|$|... "What could I do? <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> truth. To {{him even}} did I tell my family name, and the shame I had saved it from by forswearing it.|$|E
6000|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> whole thing, {{and he said}} it was smart. He said Tom Sawyer couldn't get up {{no better}} plan than what I had. Then I says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{went from}} Anna's flat to Nigel Ennison's rooms. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> truth. I {{asked him to}} take me away, and hide me. He refused. He sent me home." ...|$|E
60|$|Certainly he had, {{he assured}} me. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> about <b>the</b> date {{and his head}} and {{shoulders}} disappeared into a cupboard. In a few minutes he withdrew them and called out sharply for his assistant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--well; I don't {{know whether}} I said exactly that, but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>the</b> whole thing {{must come to}} an end. And it must. Luckily it seems that nothing has been said on either side." ...|$|R
60|$|There and then, as {{briefly as}} <b>I</b> might, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> whilst <b>the</b> others stood by to listen, how I had come upon the Marquis in the château {{the night before}} and what had passed thereafter.|$|R
