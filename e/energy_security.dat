5|$|As of 2010, major long-standing {{extraction}} {{industries are}} operating in Estonia, Brazil, and China. Its economic viability usually requires {{a lack of}} locally available crude oil. National <b>energy</b> <b>security</b> issues have {{also played a role}} in its development. Critics of shale oil extraction pose questions about environmental management issues, such as waste disposal, extensive water use, waste water management, and air pollution.|$|E
5|$|Biofuels, in {{the form}} of liquid fuels derived from plant materials, are {{entering}} the market, driven by factors such as oil price spikes and the need for increased <b>energy</b> <b>security.</b> However, many of the biofuels that are currently being supplied have been criticised for their adverse impacts on the natural environment, food security, and land use.|$|E

5|$|Second-generation {{technologies}} include {{solar heating}} and cooling, wind power, modern forms of bioenergy, and solar photovoltaics. These are now entering markets {{as a result}} of research, development and demonstration (RD) investments since the 1980s. Initial investment was prompted by <b>energy</b> <b>security</b> concerns linked to the oil crises of the 1970s but the enduring appeal of these technologies is due, at least in part, to environmental benefits. Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits. It will increase countries’ <b>energy</b> <b>security</b> through reliance on an indigenous, inexhaustible and mostly import-independent resource, enhance sustainability, reduce pollution, lower {{the costs of}} mitigating climate change, and keep fossil fuel prices lower than otherwise. These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely spent {{and need to be}} widely shared.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers report, India's GDP at {{purchasing}} power parity could overtake {{that of the}} United States by 2045. During the next four decades, Indian GDP {{is expected to grow}} at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy until 2050. The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle class. The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, <b>energy</b> <b>security,</b> and public health and nutrition.|$|E

5|$|Research is also {{undertaken}} {{in this field}} of artificial photosynthesis. It {{involves the use of}} nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds, by splitting water to produce hydrogen fuel or then combining with carbon dioxide to make biopolymers such as methanol. Many large national and regional research projects on artificial photosynthesis are now trying to develop techniques integrating improved light capture, quantum coherence methods of electron transfer and cheap catalytic materials that operate under a variety of atmospheric conditions. Senior researchers in the field have made the public policy case for a Global Project on Artificial Photosynthesis to address critical <b>energy</b> <b>security</b> and environmental sustainability issues.|$|E
5|$|Author Jeremy Rifkin had {{previously}} written several books that, like The Empathic Civilization, {{have attempted to}} extrapolate trends in the economy, technology, and society. For example, his 1995 book The End of Work concerns the changes that tele-commuting {{would have on the}} workplace, his 1998 book The Biotech Century concerns the expected impacts of genetic engineering, and his 2002 book The Hydrogen Economy concerns the economic and social effects that will result from the expected replacement of fossil fuels with hydrogen as an energy storage medium. His last book before writing The Empathic Civilization was The European Dream, published in 2004, comparing the American Dream with the values expressed by Europeans in the post-industrial economy. At the time of publication, the 64-year-old Rifkin was working as an advisor to the European Union concerning issues relating to the economy, climate change, and <b>energy</b> <b>security,</b> as well as president of the American non-profit organization the Foundation on Economic Trends.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{the energy}} {{consumption}} was 240 billion kilowatt hours. As Turkey imported 72 {{percent of its}} energy in 2013, the government decided to invest in nuclear power to reduce imports. Three nuclear power stations are to be built by 2023. Turkey's first nuclear power plants are planned {{to be built in}} Mersin's Akkuyu district on the Mediterranean coast; in Sinop's İnceburun district on the Black Sea coast; and in Kırklareli's İğneada district on the Black Sea coast. Turkey has the fifth highest direct utilisation and capacity of geothermal power in the world. Turkey is a partner country of the EU INOGATE energy programme, which has four key topics: enhancing <b>energy</b> <b>security,</b> convergence of member state energy markets on the basis of EU internal energy market principles, supporting sustainable energy development, and attracting investment for energy projects of common and regional interest.|$|E

At the April 2008 summit in Bucharest, Romania, NATO agreed to the accession of Croatia and Albania and both countries joined NATO in April 2009. Ukraine and Georgia were also told that they could eventually become members. The issue of Georgian and Ukrainian membership in NATO prompted harsh criticism from Russia, as did NATO plans for a missile defence system. Studies for this system began in 2002, with negotiations centered on anti-ballistic missiles being stationed in Poland and the Czech Republic. Though NATO leaders gave assurances that the system was not targeting Russia, both presidents Vladimir Putin and Dmitry Medvedev criticized it as a threat.|$|E
