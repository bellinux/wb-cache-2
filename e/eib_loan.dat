50|$|In June 2014, tenders for {{construction}} of two sections between Botevgrad and Mezdra were announced. In September 2014, the Road Infrastructure Agency announced that construction of Botevgrad-Vidin expressway shall be financed by an <b>EIB</b> <b>loan.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The European Investment Bank, which {{provided}} 110 million euros in funding for Bial's FAAH inhibitor programme stated {{it had been}} in contact with the company about the incident, but that [...] "it would be premature to consider recall of the <b>EIB</b> <b>loan</b> at this stage".|$|E
25|$|The European Investment Bank (<b>EIB)</b> {{approved}} two <b>loans</b> for {{the rehabilitation}} of the water supply network in Greater Amman in 1996 and 1998 {{for a total of}} 49 million Euro. WAJ has benefited from 8 <b>EIB</b> <b>loans</b> amounting to 61.5 million Euro between 1984 and 1998.|$|R
50|$|The Mufulira smelter {{was first}} built in 1937. Prior to {{privatization}} in 2000, 100% of all SO2 {{went into the}} atmosphere, and the latest information confirms that the situation has improved since, including notably through the investment financed by <b>EIB’s</b> <b>loan</b> to Mopani copper mine for modernization of the copper smelter. The project has successfully established the capacity to eliminate 170,000 tonnes of sulfur dioxide a year, materially contributing {{to the protection of}} the environment. This improvement has been strongly contradicted by recent reports on the effects of pollution on local residents.|$|R

50|$|The Sofia {{ring road}} {{is divided into}} four {{sections}} (arcs), at south, north, west and east. A major part of southern arc has been significantly upgraded in several stages between 2007 and 2012, providing now a conflict-free connection between the Boyana and the Mladost IV junctions. The next planned upgrade on the southern section will be between the Buxton district and the Lyulin motorway (A6), which may begin after 2013. The segment between Mladost and Tsarigradsko shose blvd / Trakia motorway (A1) interchange has conceptual design since 2015, with a proposal to be upgraded with an <b>EIB</b> <b>loan.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} of the motorway began in 1973 and the first 10 km from Sofia to Novi Han entered in service in 1978. In 1984 the motorway reached Plovdiv, the second largest city in Bulgaria. In 1995 a 32 km section between Plovdiv and Plodovitovo interchange was completed with EBRD co-financing. In 2000 <b>EIB</b> <b>loan</b> was secured for the {{construction of}} two sections, between Orizovo interchange and Stara Zagora (lot 1), and lot 5, between Karnobat and Burgas, fourth largest city, situated at the Black sea coast. The motorway reached Stara Zagora in 2007, and lot 5 entered in service in 2006.|$|E
50|$|The European Investment Bank (EIB) {{has granted}} two loans (EUR 15 million in 1995 and EUR 16 million in 2001) to the Senegalese Government under the Long-Term Water Project to finance water supply {{services}} in Dakar. In November 2007 the EIB signed two additional financing agreements with SONES, {{in support of}} Senegal’s National Drinking Water and Sewerage Programme for the Millennium (PEPAM). A European Development Fund (EDF) subsidy of CFAF 5.7 billion (EUR 8.6 million) and an <b>EIB</b> <b>loan</b> of CFAF 9.8 billion (EUR 15 million) complete the financing of SONES’s total investment programme of CFAF 38 billion (EUR 58 million). Under the project, more than 60 urban centres, including Dakar, will benefit from schemes to rehabilitate, upgrade and extend the drinking water supply network, reaching more than 500,000 people over four years. The planned works comprise the creation of 25 new boreholes, construction of a water treatment plant, extension of the supply network by more than 500 km and installation of 50,000 subsidized connections and 360 standpipes. The four finance providers involved have undertaken to harmonise their procedures, implementing the commitments made under the Paris Declaration on the harmonisation of development aid.|$|E
5000|$|Construction of the Enguri dam {{began in}} 1961. The dam became {{temporarily}} operational in 1978, and {{was completed in}} 1987. In 1994, the dam was inspected by engineers of Hydro-Québec, who found that the dam was [...] "in a rare state of dilapidation". [...] In 1999, the European Commission granted €9.4 million to Georgia for urgent repairs at the Enguri HES, including replacing the stoplog at the arch dam on the Georgian side and, refurbishing {{one of the five}} generators of the power station at the Abkhaz side. [...] In total, €116 million loans were granted by the EBRD, the European Union, the Japanese Government, KfW and Government of Georgia. In 2011 The European Investment Bank (<b>EIB)</b> <b>loaned</b> €20 million in order to complete the rehabilitation of the Enguri hydropower plant and to ensure safe water evacuation towards the Black Sea at the Vardnili hydropower cascade.|$|R
40|$|Significant {{volumes of}} Structural and Cohesion Funds have been pre-allocated but remain undisbursed or uncommitted. In Portugal, unused funds amount to 9. 3 percent of GDP, in Greece close to 7 percent, and {{in central and}} eastern European {{countries}} about 15 percent. These funds should be part of a temporary European Fund for Economic Revival (EFER) for 2011 - 13, which would promote economic growth in crisis-hit countries and facilitate structural reforms. For countries under financial assistance in particular, the European Commission has a role to play in identifying the â??rightâ?? objectives for which the funds should be used. The Commission could decide to manage the funds directly with the support of an executive agency. Greater efforts should be made to exploit synergies between EU grants and European Investment Bank <b>loans,</b> allowing <b>EIB</b> <b>loans</b> to finance the total costs of a project or programme in small countries, and leveraging the whole EU budget to attract private investment. ...|$|R
25|$|The European Investment Bank (<b>EIB)</b> {{provided}} <b>loan</b> {{funding for}} refurbishing water reservoirs and {{was expected to}} fund {{the construction of the}} south regional wastewater treatment plant and a section of the North-South municipal water carrier in Gaza. Within the framework of the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP), the EIB financed operations with more than 137 million Euro in the West Bank and Gaza between 1995 and 2010. 10% of the funds were allocated to the water and environment sector.|$|R

40|$|At the {{extraordinary}} EU Council of 21 July European leaders have {{to accomplish a}} triple-mission. First, they should {{pave the way to}} restoring solvency in Greece by initiating debt reduction. Softening the Greek debt burden implies i) reducing the interest rate on official lending, ii) requesting from the EFSF support for an immediate bond buy-back programme, and iii) asking the ESRB for an immediate evaluation of the risks to financial stability involved in a future restructuring of the sovereign debts in the euro area. Second, they should promote immediate growth-enhancing measures to be financed through unused EU structural funds and <b>EIB</b> <b>loans</b> (€ 16 bn). The available funds shall be used to i) raise the quality of higher education, ii) finance wage subsidies in manufacturing and tourism so as to generate an internal devaluation at contained domestic-demand costs; and ii) create research laboratories (i. e. lighthouse innovation projects) that would support an upgrading of the Greek value chain. Third, they should address risks to financial stability in the euro zone by breaking the vicious circle between sovereign debt and banking risk. The EFSF should be able to guarantee national deposit insurance schemes; at the same time, the European Banking Authority should assume stronger supervisory powers. This is an immediate action plans but of course more ambitious reforms are necessary down the road...|$|R
25|$|Another {{round of}} {{expansion}} started in 2007. A third runway opened on 29 October 2007, {{to relieve congestion}} on the other two runways. Terminal 3 (T3) was completed in February 2008, {{in time for the}} Beijing Olympics. This colossal expansion also included a rail link to the city-center. At its opening, the new Terminal 3 was the largest man made structure in {{the world in terms of}} area covered, and a major landmark representing Beijing as the growing and developing Chinese capital. The expansion was largely funded by a 30 billion yen loan from Japan and a 500-million-euro (USD 625 million) loan from the European Investment Bank (<b>EIB).</b> The <b>loan</b> is the largest ever granted by the EIB in Asia; the agreement was signed during the eighth China-EU Summit held in September 2005.|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} sophistication of private financial markets in Europe, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has been expanding as never before. Is the Bank just one among many large banks prepared to provide project finance in Europe, {{or does it}} have a distinct public policy role? We argue that its main distinguishing role to date has been to bring competition and efficiency to the less efficient banking markets. But new initiatives envisage a move to more <b>EIB</b> involvement in <b>loan</b> guarantees and equity investment. We review the potential here and offer some cautionary remarks.

5000|$|A draft loan {{contract}} of $180 mln {{to fund the}} expansion works of Tanger-Med port was signed in October 2008 for building a second deepwater port, dubbed [...] "Tangier Med II", to meet the growing demand for container handling at international level in sea transport. The new port facilities, scheduled to be operational by {{the second half of}} 2012, will include two new container terminals with a total length of 2,800 m and an additional nominal capacity of 5 million containers. Final official approval for [...] "Tangier Med II" [...] was received on 7 January 2009, with actual construction started on 17 June 2009. In November 2010 the European Investment Bank (<b>EIB)</b> signed a <b>loan</b> of €200 million for the extension of the port.|$|R
40|$|In {{the face}} of {{continuing}} financial and economic crises, the European Investment Bank (EIB) {{has been criticized for}} being overly-conservative in its loans to Europe. Critics in particular have called on the EIB to vastly increase its investment in utilities as a counter-cyclical measure. To take stock and, in order to evaluate the role of the EIB in financing utilities over time, we compile and analyze an original database of all <b>EIB</b> utilities project <b>loans</b> from 1958 to 2004. We find the EIB started out by functioning as a regional development bank, prioritizing utilities finance in its members’ poorer zones; however, energy crises in the 1970 s marked a shift whereby the logic of EIB finance to utilities became more politically-oriented. By the 1980 s, utilities projects supported by the EIB were intimately related to those required for the Single Market. The origins of the EIB’s current conservative approach to utilities loans was born in the 1970 s and fully consolidated by the 1990 s. ...|$|R
