40|$|The TIROS IV Meteorological Satellite {{contains}} a medium resolution scanning radiometer. Two of the channels of this instrument {{are sensitive to}} reflected solar radiation and the remaining two respond to emitted thermal radiation from the earth and its atmosphere. The two thermal channels are calibrated in terms of equivalent blackbody temperatures, and the reflected solar radiation channels in terms of effective radiant emittances. The calibration data, along with orbital and attitude data and the radiation data from the satellite, were incorporated in a computer program for an IBM 7090 which was used to produce, in binary form, the "Final Meteorological Radiation Tape" which is the basic repository of all radiation data. After launch, the radiometer displaye d the same degradation of response characteristics as did its predecessors in TIROS II and TIROS III. The onset of degradation results in a departure of {{the data from the}} prelaunch laboratory calibration. The cause of degradation has not been determined, and the matter is still being studied at the Goddard Space Flight Center. Before work with the TIROS IV radiation data is attempted, an understanding of the radiometer, its calibration, and the problems encountered in the experiment, especially from response degradation, is essential. The instrumentation design, development work, and the calibrations herein described were performed by the Goddard Space Flight Center Staff, whereas the computer and programming efforts were carried out jointly by the staffs of the National Weather Satellite Center, U. S. Weather Bureau, and the Goddard Space Flight Center. In this Catalog-Manual, the radiometer an d its calibration, data processing, the "Final Meteorological Radiation Tape", the observed degradation patterns, and possible corrections for degradation are discussed. The Catalog-Manual also includes, in two forms, documentation of each orbit of successfully reduced radiation data acquired by TIROS IV.

40|$|Hourly global solar {{radiation}} in a weather file {{is one of the}} significant parameters for improving building energy performance analyses using simulation programs. However, most weather stations worldwide are not equipped with {{solar radiation}} sensors because they tend to be difficult to manage. In South Korea, only twenty-two out of ninety-two weather stations are equipped with sensors, and there are large areas not equipped with any sensors. Thus, solar radiation must often be calculated by reliable solar models. Hence, it is important to find a reliable model that can be applied in the wide variety of weather conditions seen in South Korea. In this study, solar radiation in the southeastern part of South Korea was calculated using three solar models: cloud-cover radiation model (CRM), Zhang and Huang model (ZHM), and <b>meteorological</b> <b>radiation</b> model (MRM). These values were then compared to measured solar radiation data. After that, the calculated solar radiation data from the three solar models were used in a building energy simulation for an office building with various window characteristics conditions, in order to identify how solar radiation differences affect building energy performance. It was found that a seasonal solar model for the area should be developed to improve building energy performance analysis...|$|R
40|$|All {{solar energy}} {{applications}} require readily available, site-oriented and long-term solar radiation data. A typical database comprises of global, direct and diffuse solar irradiance, {{duration of sunshine}} and complementary data like cloud cover, atmospheric turbidity, humidity, temperature, etc. However, most of these stations do not provide complete if any information on solar data, chiefly due to the capital and maintenance costs that measuring instruments incur. For instance, global radiation is the most frequently measured parameter, its two components, i. e. diffuse and direct irradiance are often not measured. Improvements {{have been made to}} the <b>meteorological</b> <b>radiation</b> model MRM which, had been developed by Muneer et al. as a simple broadband irradiance estimation model based on synoptic information, by incorporating the sunshine information in the model's regressions. The result of the improvement of the model is a considerable reduction in biases and scatter in the comparison between estimated and measured data. The improved <b>meteorological</b> <b>radiation</b> model, IMRM is more accurate, by up to 70 % in some cases, than its predecessor in estimating, global and diffuse horizontal irradiance. When sunshine, atmospheric pressure and temperature are not measured by a nearby station, yet cloud information is recorded, radiation estimation models based on cloud cover, CRM, can be used. Three CRMs have been compared to newly proposed models. It was found that models with locally fitted coefficients gave a more accurate estimation of the solar radiation than CRMs with generalized coefficients. The newly proposed model performed better that the older generation models. The third section of the article deals with estimation of diffuse radiation and possible improvements in its modeling. In this section, apart from clearness index (kt), influence of the synoptic parameters of sunshine fraction (SF), cloud cover (CC) and air mass (m) on diffuse fraction of global radiation (k) is studied both qualitatively and quantitatively. It is found that, SF shows a strong bearing on the k-kt relationship followed by CC and then m. As a next step, a series of models are developed for k as a polynomial function of kt, SF, CC and m. After an extensive evaluation procedure, a regression model is selected such that the diffuse radiation can be estimated with reasonable accuracy without making the model overtly complex. It was found that among all the models, the composite model involving all parameters provides the most accurate estimation of diffuse radiation. The site-specific models are further investigated for any appreciable correlations between different locations and their possible attributions. It was also found that a single model could more than adequately estimate the diffuse radiation for the locations within a given region. Three optimum models are also recommended for each region, {{in view of the fact}} that information on all parameters is not necessarily available for all sites. This study reveals a significant improvement from the conventional k-kt regression models to the presently proposed models, therefore, leading to more accurate estimation of diffuse radiation by approximately 50 %.

To show the flexibility and great performance of the MRM, a harsh test of the code under the (almost total) solar eclipse conditions of 29 March 2006 over Athens was performed and comparison of its results with real measurements was made. From this hard comparison it is shown that the MRM can simulate solar radiation during a solar eclipse event as effectively as on a typical day. Because of the main interest in solar energy applications about the total radiation component, MRM focuses on that. For this component, the RMSE and MBE statistical estimators during this study were found to be 7. 64 % and ? 1. 67 % on 29 March as compared to the respective 5. 30 % and + 2. 04 % for 28 March.

40|$|This thesis deals with- {{various aspects}} of {{broadband}} horizontal solar irradiance. Quality control of measured datasets are identified and analysed. It was found that solar irradiance datasets may contain significant errors. These sources of errors were divided in two categories, the inherent instrument errors and operation related errors. Methods of assessing {{the quality of the}} datasets were evaluated and found to be unsatisfactory. A new method was hence developed to quality control the solar irradiance data. The quality control procedure consists of two tiers of tests. The first tests are physical tests that identify and remove data points that are physical impossibilities. The second tier tests consist of the creation of a mathematical envelope of acceptance in a sky clarity index domain. This envelope of acceptance is based on multiples of standard deviations of the weighted mean of clearness index to diffuse ratio. The available datasets in this study were thus quality controlled to remove any obvious outliers. Modelling the solar resource is an important tool for engineers and scientists. Such models have been developed since {{the second half of the}} 20 th century. Some models rely on one or two meteorological parameters to estimate the solar irradiance, while other models are more complex and require a far greater number of points. Two of these models have been analysed and evaluated. The two models are all-sky, broadband solar irradiance models. The first model analysed is the <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Radiation</b> Model, or MRM. This model is in fact a sunshine based model, with atmospheric turbidity taken into account as well. The beam irradiance component was found to be acceptable given the number of inputs required by the model. Any extra parameters would increase the complexity of the model, without noticeable improvements. The regressions were modified to take into account sunshine fraction banding. However the diffuse irradiance was identified as one which had the potential III for improvement. Thus, in the present work an attempt has been made to develop improved models. The new model was found to be far superior to the older, original model, thus the name Improved <b>Meteorological</b> <b>Radiation</b> Model, IMRM. The second type of model investigated is the cloud based radiation model. This type of model is simple to use and rely on regressions between irradiation, solar altitude angle and the cloud cover. Careful analysis of the cloud distribution reveals certain flaws in the current regressions. New regressions were formulated and the result was a model superior to all its predecessors. Clear-sky modelling is important for maximum load calculations; however, there is no method of extracting with accuracy clear-sky broadband data. Clear-sky identification techniques were evaluated and a new method was devised. These new datasets were used on four clear-sky models, MRM, Page's Radiation Model, PRM, Yang's radiation model and Gueymard's REST 2 model. It was found that using this new method of extracting extremeclear- sky data, the models performed better than when using quasi-clear-sky data. Solar radiation modelling is not an end by-itself, it must serve a purpose for engineers in their applications. Napier University has installed a 160 m 2 photovoltaic facility in 2003. A 27 -year solar radiation dataset was available for Edinburgh, to do feasibility calculations for the project; however this dataset contained gaps in the data. The cloud radiation model developed in this study was utilised to this end. In addition a complete life cycle analysis was performed on the project, and it was found that with an average efficiency at around 12 %, the facility will payback its embodied energy in eight years, and based on a relatively conservative forecast of energy prices, the financial payback is set at under 100 years.

However, solar energy and other renewable energy sources have a drawback related to the difficulty in predicting their availability in the near future. This problem affects optimal exploitation of solar energy, especially in connection with other resources. Therefore, reliable solar energy prediction models are essential to solar energy management and economics. This paper presents work aimed at designing reliable models to predict the global horizontal irradiance (GHI) for the next day in 8 stations in Saudi Arabia. The designed models are based on computational intelligence methods of automated-design fuzzy logic systems. The fuzzy logic systems are designed and optimized with two models using fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) and simulated annealing (SA) algorithms. The first model uses FCM based on the subtractive clustering algorithm to automatically design the predictor fuzzy rules from data. The second model is using FCM followed by simulated annealing algorithm to enhance the prediction accuracy of the fuzzy logic system. The objective of the predictor is to accurately predict next-day global horizontal irradiance (GHI) using previous-day <b>meteorological</b> and solar <b>radiation</b> observations. The proposed models use observations of 10 variables of measured <b>meteorological</b> and solar <b>radiation</b> data to build the model. The experimentation and results of the prediction are detailed where the root mean square error of the prediction was approximately 88 % for the second model tuned by simulated annealing compared to 79. 75 % accuracy using the first model. This results demonstrate a good modeling accuracy of the second model despite that the training and testing of the proposed models were carried out using spatially and temporally independent data...|$|R
40|$|Renaissance natural {{philosophers}} {{believed that}} meteorological phenomena were imperfect mixtures that lacked their own essences or substantial forms. This contention, {{along with the}} lack of any significant discussion of teleology in Aristotle's Meteorology, left Renaissance natural philosophers with several options in discussions of the final causes of weather. Some, particularly Italian scholars, contended that there were no <b>final</b> causes for <b>meteorological</b> events. In contrast, Pietro Pomponazzi argued that, while meteorological phenomena were accidental, they were purposeful as part of God's ordering of the universe, even though humans are unable to understand these purposes. Many Lutheran scholars believed that these ends could be known, arguing that their purpose derived from their being divine signs of the future and God's will...|$|R
40|$|Hourly {{and daily}} {{variations}} of ground-level ozone have been analyzed {{in relation to}} <b>meteorological</b> parameters, UVB <b>radiation</b> and radon near the Baltic Sea in Lithuania. An atypical situation with respect to wind domination was observed during the experiment: the wind from the continent was twice as frequent as the wind from the sea. The close correlation between ground-level ozone concentration and UVB radiation intensity was established. The vertical migration directions of ozone and radon were opposite and the negative correlation between these pollutants was observed. The diurnal course of ozone and radon {{and the influence of}} meteorological parameters (temperature, relative air humidity, wind speed and direction) on variation of these pollutants have been estimated. It was established that the wind direction domination during the experiment had a significant influence on the variation of ozone and radon concentrations...|$|R

This paper {{presents the results of}} intercomparison flights between three pairs of aircraft. The results are very similar for mean parameters except for the horizontal wind measurements provided by the Merlin that showed a problem that is probably linked to the measurement of the aircraft velocity. Further investigation is required to know whether corrections are possible or not for these wind measurements. Turbulence is studied along two legs over a flat and homogeneous area: in spite of the heterogeneity of the measured functions (one leg is close {{to the top of the}} boundary layer), the comparison is rather good. The relative accuracy of the data provided to the data base is given. It easily allows to use the huge amount of aircraft data collected during the experiment with very few restrictions. We underline some points where efforts should be borne for future experiments: wind coupling between Inertial Navigation System data and Global Positioning System (GPS) data, CO and NOx measurements...|$|R
