Telling apart clinically a XP from a tumor condition can be challenging as pointed out by several authors. Cozzutto and Carbone suggested that a wide array of entities characterized by a large content of histiocytes and foamy macrophages could be traced back at least in part to a xanthogranulomatous inflammation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Inflammatory</b> <b>pseudotumors</b> (<b>inflammatory</b> myofibroblastic tumors) of {{the lung}} are myofibroblastic lesions of {{controversial}} nosology. The concept {{that these are}} benign lesions has been recently questioned given their capacity for local invasion and recurrence. PROCEDURE AND RESULTS: We observed five children with <b>inflammatory</b> <b>pseudotumors</b> of the lung in whom the tumor was resected using the most limited excision possible. Unusually, in all five cases the tumor was localized in the right upper lobe: Three were parenchymal, and the others involved the bronchus. The three parenchymal masses underwent wedge resection, whereas the two bronchial lesions required ex-cision followed by a bronchoplasty and an up-per lobectomy, respectively. In all, the pathology showed a complete resection, and the patients had uneventful recoveries. Follow-ups, including CT and bronchoscopies, ranged from 4 to 8 years (mean of 6. 4 years) with no signs of recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Our limited experience supports the idea that excisional surgery is the treatment of choice for <b>inflammatory</b> <b>pseudotumors</b> of the lung. Such excisions, both diagnostic and curative, carry minimal risks and avoid unnecessary mutilation. Closely monitored follow-up is mandatory, as {{the natural history of}} this lesion is not yet well understood...|$|R

40|$|<b>Inflammatory</b> <b>pseudotumor</b> of {{the liver}} is a rare tumor. It has {{variable}} clinical presentations and image findings.

However, a thicker tumor capsule than that of typical hepatocellular carcinoma was noted while reviewing the computed tomography images.

40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Inflammatory</b> eosinophilic <b>pseudotumor</b> of {{the bladder}} {{is a rare}} {{inflammatory}} bladder disease. The etiology and pathophysiology of this condition are still unclear. Few case reports have described <b>inflammatory</b> eosinophilic <b>pseudotumor</b> of the bladder in adults or children. Although benign, this disease is occasionally clinically aggressive and locally invasive, thus open surgical removal or complete transurethral resection is recommended. Case presentation We present {{the case of a}} biopsy-proven <b>inflammatory</b> eosinophilic <b>pseudotumor</b> of the bladder in a previously healthy 16 -year-old male adolescent with 2 -month history of frequent micturition and dysuria with no significant apparent causative factors. The tumor regressed after a 6 -week course of glucocorticosteroids. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, our case is a rare case of <b>inflammatory</b> eosinophilic <b>pseudotumor</b> of the bladder treated with complete conservative management. Due to its glucocorticosteroid-sensitive nature, we postulate that this disease belongs to a subgroup of eosinophilic disorders. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction It {{has been}} {{reported}} that immunoglobulin G 4 -related systemic disease can spread to nearly every organ, and often presents as an inflammatory mass or masses at those sites. In the kidney, this disease is often diagnosed after a radical or partial nephrectomy following the discovery of an inflammatory mass which is often suspected to be a malignant tumor. Here, we present a rare case of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>pseudotumors</b> of the kidney and the lung presenting as immunoglobulin G 4 -related disease, which were diagnosed by computed tomography-guided biopsies. Case presentation A 54 -year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital with suspected bilateral renal cancer, multiple lung metastases and autoimmune pancreatitis. His serum immunoglobulin G 4 level was high. We used computed tomography-guided biopsies and histopathological examinations of the biopsied specimens to diagnose the tumors as immunoglobulin G 4 -related bilateral renal and lung <b>inflammatory</b> <b>pseudotumors.</b> Our patient was treated with oral prednisolone, and after one month of treatment, contrast-enhanced computed tomography demonstrated a general improvement, as noted by a reduction in size of the masses. Conclusion Renal masses that are formed due to immunoglobulin G 4 -related disease require comprehensive diagnosis to prevent unnecessary surgical resections from being performed. Further consideration should be paid to immunoglobulin G 4 -related diseases in the future. </p...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that {{expression}} of cyclooxygenase- 2 (Cox- 2) is elevated in transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder and that inhibition of Cox- 2 activity suppresses bladder cancer in experimental animal models. We have investigated the expression of Cox- 2 protein in human TCCs (n = 85), in in situ carcinomas (Tis) of the urinary bladder (n = 17), and in nonneoplastic urinary bladder samples (n = 16) using immunohistochemistry. Cox- 2 immunoreactivity was detected in 66 % (67 of 102) of the carcinomas, whereas only 25 % (4 of 16) of the nonneoplastic samples were positive (P 90 % of the tumor cells positive) than the invasive carcinomas (10 %) (P < 0. 05). However, several invasive TCCs exhibited the strongest intensity of Cox- 2 staining in the invading cells, whereas {{other parts of the}} tumor were virtually negative. Finally, strong Cox- 2 positivity was also found in nonneoplastic ulcerations (2 of 2) and in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>pseudotumors</b> (2 of 2), in which the immunoreactivity localized to the nonepithelial cells. Taken together, our data suggest that Cox- 2 is highly expressed in noninvasive bladder carcinomas, whereas the highest expression of invasive tumors associated with the invading cells, and that Cox- 2 may also have a pathophysiological role in nonneoplastic conditions of the urinary bladder, such as ulcerations and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>pseudotumors...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Cases of {{recurrent}} <b>inflammatory</b> <b>pseudotumor</b> have only rarely been reported. The treatment for recurrent pseudotumor is surgery. Patients {{not eligible for}} surgery require different treatment, and the optimal type of the treatment is controversial. Case Presentation A 54 -year-old woman was noted to have an abnormal shadow in the right middle lung field on chest X-ray. Computed tomography of the chest revealed an infiltrative lesion in the right segment 4 and a nodule in the right segment 8. She underwent right middle lobectomy and partial resection of the right segment 8. Histopathology revealed non-atypical lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrates, leading to the diagnosis of the lymphoplasmacytic type of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>pseudotumor.</b> During postoperative follow-up, chest computed tomography revealed a nodular lesion in the left segment 3 and an infiltrative lesion in the right segment 2.
