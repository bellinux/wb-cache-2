Os sistemas de tratamento convencionais muitas vezes nÃo sÃo capazes de promover a remoÃÃo de nutrientes de modo a satisfazer a legislaÃÃo vigente. Portanto, faz-se necessÃria a adoÃÃo de mecanismos de pÃs-tratamento para a remoÃÃo desses compostos. O presente estudo se propÃs a avaliar e comparar o desempenho de dois reatores quanto Ã nitritaÃÃo parcial, sendo um reator em batelada sequencial e um reator de fluxo contÃnuo, com biomassa em suspensÃo no tratamento prÃ-ANAMMOX de efluente de abate de aves. Neste experimento, foram utilizados dois reatores, o primeiro no modelo em batelada sequencial, em que foram testadas como mecanismo de inibiÃÃo das bactÃrias oxidadoras de nitrito as reduÃÃes de tempos de ciclo de 24, 16, 6, 5 e 4 horas, associando ainda as condiÃÃes de baixa concentraÃÃo de oxigÃnio dissolvido, inibiÃÃo por amÃnia livre ou restriÃÃo de alcalinidade. A inibiÃÃo dos organismos oxidantes de nitrito foi alcanÃada com tempo de ciclo de 4 horas, baixa concentraÃÃo de oxigÃnio dissolvido (na faixa de 0, 3 a 0, 5 mg. L- 1) e fornecimento de alcalinidade na forma de carbonatos e bicarbonatos para oxidaÃÃo de 50 % da amÃnia (restriÃÃo de alcalinidade). O tempo de 4 horas foi insuficiente para atingir a oxidaÃÃo de 50 % da amÃnia entÃo partiu-se para os testes de nitritaÃÃo parcial em funÃÃo do tempo e atingiu-se o tempo de ciclo mÃdio de 6, 03 Â 0, 63 h. Assim, deu-se inÃcio Ã operaÃÃo do reator em fluxo contÃnuo com as melhores condiÃÃes do reator em batelada, o qual foi operado com TDH de 6 horas, SSV na inoculaÃÃo de 2700 mg.

No inÃcio da retirada de dados, o reator apresentou acÃmulo de nitrato e, como estratÃgia de inibiÃÃo das bactÃrias nitratadoras, houve a reduÃÃo de SSV para 1500 mg. L- 1, eficaz para a inibiÃÃo dos organismos oxidantes de nitrito. PorÃm, durante os 40 dias de operaÃÃo do reator de fluxo contÃnuo, o mesmo nÃo apresentou comportamento estÃvel quanto Ã obtenÃÃo de efluente com relaÃÃo de 50 % nitrogÃnio amoniacal e 50 % nitrito, desejÃvel no afluente prÃ-ANAMMOX. The poultry {{slaughter}} {{industries have}} been producing an effluent with nitrogen which, when released in watercourses, can have strong impact on natural environments. Mostly, the conventional treatment {{systems are not}} able to remove nutrients in the right levels that are demanded by Brazilian legislation. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt post-treatment mechanisms to remove those composts. Thus, the present study aimed at evaluating and comparing both reactors performance concerning partial nitritation with a sequential batch reactor and a continuous flow one, whose biomass is under suspension at pre-ANAMMOX treatment using poultry slaughter effluent. Two reactors were used in this trial: the first model is in the sequential batch, in which the time reductions in cycle of 24, 16, 6, 5 and 4 hours were tested as a mechanism of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria inhibition. The conditions of low concentration of dissolved oxygen, ammonia inhibition or restriction of <b>free</b> <b>alkalinity</b> were also associated in this process. While, nitrite-oxidizing organisms Inhibition was achieved with a 4 hour time cycle, with low dissolved oxygen concentration (0. 3 to 0. 5 mg. L- 1) and supplying alkalinity as carbonates and bicarbonates to 50 % ammonia oxidation (restriction alkalinity). A four hour time was not enough to achieve 50 % oxidation of ammonia. Then, there were partial nitritation tests according to time, consequently such cycle time reached up an average of 6. 03 Â 0. 63 hours. So, the continuous flow reactor started working with the best batch conditions, which was operated with a 6 hour HRT, SSV in 2700 mg. L- 1 inoculation and 0. 015 L. h- 1 recycle flow. When the data removal began, the reactor showed a nitrate accumulation as a strategy to inhibit nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, so, there was a reduction in SSV to 1500 mg. L- 1, which was effective to inhibit nitrite-oxidizing organisms. But, during the 40 days of operation, the continuous flow reactor did not show stable behavior concerning the effluent attainment as compared to 50 % ammoniacal nitrogen and 50 % nitrite, available in the pre-ANAMMOX affluent...|$|E

The water regime was acidic to alkaline and could be classified under ‘soft’ to ‘moderately hard’ category. Major anions and cations except iron were found well within maximum permissible limits for drinking and irrigational purposes. The water regime was also found <b>free</b> from <b>alkalinity,</b> chloride and nitrate-nitrogen hazard. Principal component analysis demonstrated the geogenic and anthropogenic influences on the water quality of the study area. Hierarchical cluster analysis grouped water sources into statistically significant clusters based on the similarity of water quality characteristics. Overall, this study is a first approach and contributes to the establishment of water quality in the Jia-Bharali river basin and its adjoining areas.

40|$|Although {{swimming}} {{is known}} to be beneficial in terms of cardiovascular health, as well as some forms of rehabilitation, swimming is also known to present risks to human health, largely in the form of exposure to microbial pathogens and disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Chlorination is the most common method of disinfection for swimming pools. The two primary goals of applying chlorine in water treatment are inactivation of microbial pathogens and oxidation of soluble organic compounds. However, important drawbacks of swimming pool chlorination include limited efficacy against some microbial pathogens, particularly Cryptosporidium parvum and Giardia lamblia, and the formation of potentially harmful DBPs. Acute and chronic human health problems associated with exposure to DBPs in swimming pools have been identified. ^ In recent years, combined UV/chlorine treatment has been applied with increasing frequency to swimming pool water because UV irradiation {{is known to}} be effective for inactivation of some chlorine-resistant microbial pathogens (e. g., C. parvum and G. lamblia), and {{it has the potential to}} promote photodecay of some disinfection by-products (DBPs) (e. g., inorganic chloramines). However, it has also been reported in the literature that UV-based treatment has the potential to promote formation of some DBPs (e. g., CNCl and CNCHCl 2). Promotion of these and other reactions also results in increases of free chlorine consumption rates. Because some residual chlorine compounds and DBPs are volatile, their presence in pools implies a potential to influence air quality in the vicinity of pools, especially for indoor pool facilities. Hence, UV irradiation has the potential to alter water and air chemistry in indoor pools. To date, observations of the effects of UV-based treatment on water chemistry in the presence of residual chlorine and DBP precursors in swimming pools have been largely anecdotal and incomplete. In addition, there are uncertainties about the UV source type (i. e., low-pressure [LP] or medium-pressure [MP] Hg lamps) to use as a secondary swimming pool water treatment process. ^ This study was conducted to further examine this issue by exploring water and air chemistry in a chlorinated indoor swimming pool under three different operating conditions: conventional chlorination (1 st year) which served as a control, chlorination augmented by MP UV irradiation (2 nd year), and chlorination augmented by LP UV irradiation (3 rd year). The UV systems were installed in an existing recirculation system as a secondary disinfectant. Water samples were collected from the pool five days per week during the academic year and once per week during summer for measurement of pH, temperature, total <b>alkalinity,</b> <b>free</b> and combined chlorine, eleven volatile DBPs, and urea concentration. In addition, for observation of air quality in the target indoor pool, measurements of gas-phase NCl 3 concentration and corrosion rates of four metal alloys were conducted. The aim of this study was to examine formation and degradation of volatile DBPs, so as to improve our understanding of the changes in water and air chemistry that will result from UV irradiation of chlorinated swimming pool water. ^ After installation of MP UV, the concentrations of dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN), and dibromochloromethane (CHBr 2 Cl) increased, whereas the concentrations of dichloromethylamine (CH 3 NCl 2), monochloramine (NH 2 Cl), dichloramine (NHCl 2), chloroform (CHCl 3), bromoform (CHBr 3) and cyanogen bromide (CNBr) decreased. LP UV irradiation also decreased CHCl 3 (more efficiently than MP UV) and CNBr concentrations; while CHBr 3, CHBr 2 Cl concentrations were increased compare to the control year. The cyanogen chloride (CNCl) and trichloramine (NCl 3) concentrations observed in the first year and after inclusion of both UV sources (MP and LP UV) of the study were not statistically significantly different. In addition, changes in the concentrations of DCAN, CH 3 NCl 2, NH 2 Cl, and NHCl 2 were statistically insignificant after inclusion of LP UV, as compared to the control year. ^ A large fraction of the existing literature regarding swimming pool air quality has focused on trichloramine (NCl 3). For this work, gas-phase NCl 3 was analyzed by an air sparging-DPD/KI method. The results showed that gas-phase NCl 3 concentration depends on the bather loading and liquid-phase NCl 3 concentration. However, an apparent “negative” concentration of gas-phase NCl 3 was observed after inclusion of UV sources as a secondary water treatment, which cannot be interpreted literally, and appears to be attributable to a source of interference in the assay. Thus, this study indicates a limitation of this analytical method for measuring trichloramine in the gas-phase by applying combined UV/ chlorine water treatment in indoor pools. ^ Among four different corrosion coupons (carbon steel, galvanized, aluminum, and 304 -stainless steel) which were installed in different locations of the target swimming pool, carbon steel had the highest corrosion rate. After installation of UV sources, the corrosion rates of these metal alloys changed, as compared to the control year; particularly after inclusion of LP UV as a secondary water treatment, the corrosion rate for all metal alloys increased significantly, which again confirmed that UV irradiation would alter water and air chemistry in indoor pools. ^ Urea is the dominant organic-N compound in human urine and sweat, and {{is known to be}} one of the important precursors for producing NCl 3 in swimming pools. Results of daily measurements of urea indicated a link between bather load and urea concentration in the pool. Urea concentration was unaffected by UV-based treatment. ^ Collectively, these results imply an overall improvement in water quality as a result of the inclusion of the both UV systems; and MP UV was more efficient than LP UV for reducing most of the eleven volatile DBPs concentration in this pool. However, a need exists to standardize the application of UV systems in recreational water settings. ^ The results of this study are also expected to benefit UV/chlorine applications in other water treatment settings, such as treatment of drinking water, wastewater, or in water reuse facilities. ...|$|R
