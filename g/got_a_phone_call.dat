[...] Hughes interviewed Hedren and members of Hitchcock's crew before preparing a script. She described her discussions with Hedren: [...] "Her wisdom and insights have helped me to put her real life ordeal on to the screen. I know Tippi is absolutely thrilled, as I am, with the casting of Sienna Miller to play her."

Prior to filming the video, or releasing the single, Carey had toned her body, and lost a reported twenty pounds. Due to her slim-down, she and Ratner wanted to flaunt Carey's new figure {{as much as possible}} throughout the video: [...] "Mariah looks better than she has ever looked. It's ridiculous. Mariah has an incredible body, but she was always kind of very voluptuous. Now she's just like, fit. And we were like, we've got to show this body." [...] As the pair came up with the video's plot, Ratner contacted McBrayer to play a male leading role, alongside Carey.

But when I heard it was legit, and then later on we <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> from Brett Ratner, who directed it. I was like, 'This is either a very elaborate prank, or this is the real deal.'" [...] In the fantasy-themed story, he recalled what he considered the video's most memorable scene, in which he and Carey, dressed in medieval attire, were walking with a unicorn. Additionally, he described the filming process as very simple, as they were given very loose directions and pointers. McBrayer claimed that during one take, they were meant to play Frisbee on the mansion lawn, and he accidentally threw it at Carey's face, jokingly adding [...] "by the time she spins back around â€” bonk, right in her face. I threw a Frisbee in Mariah Carey's face! I'm like, I'm fired!." [...] When questioned by critics regarding the song and video, Carey responded [...] "Have you seen the 'Touch My Body' video? C'mon. Clearly you must see the humour in that. Even the lyrics, 'I will hunt you down'. If anyone doesn't get the joke by this time then they are an idiot."
