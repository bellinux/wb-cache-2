It was relatively easy to forge stamps and in some cases one needed to bring the franking machine to the post office to get it loaded. Therefore the USPS (US <b>Postal</b> <b>Service)</b> initiated an information based indicia program (IBIP) [1] to provide "electronic stamps". While the two problems mentioned above were solved by applying (asymmetric) digital signatures and a special purpose hardware device on the client side, it seems that this approach introduces an unreasonable overhead.

50|$|The {{advent of}} the Mongol Empire, though {{destabilizing}} to the commercial centers of the Middle East and China, greatly facilitated travel along the Silk Road.

The Pax Mongolica of the thirteenth century had several other notable globalizing effects. It witnessed the creation of the first <b>international</b> <b>postal</b> <b>service,</b> as well as the rapid transmission of epidemic diseases such as bubonic plague across the newly unified regions of Central Asia.

40|$|<b>Postal</b> <b>services</b> {{have emerged}} and existed {{because of the}} need for {{communication}} and their millenary existence was achieved due to three elements: the only channel of communication, the state of monopoly conferred by the status of the state institution and therefore no competition. The most important known moments in the history of <b>postal</b> <b>services,</b> which led to reforms are: unification of postage charges, postal stamp appearance and now, liberalization of <b>postal</b> <b>services.</b> The slow development of the postal sector varies from country to country, depending on the state of development of the country and within countries depending on the gap between urban and rural areas. The operation of <b>postal</b> <b>services</b> throughout their existence was and is provided by specific legislation and it should be aligned with <b>international</b> <b>postal</b> legislation, to ensure continuity of information. There can be no country to formulate its own laws or its own organization, without regard to organization and international regulations. Both the specificity and diversity of <b>postal</b> <b>services</b> causes a special approach {{in the context of their}} market and also in the <b>services</b> market context. <b>Postal</b> <b>services</b> are services of general interest, which emerged from communication need, from personal or official needs, not from economic needs. As an alternative to <b>postal</b> <b>services</b> have emerged and developed rapidly the courier services that come to complete and even compete to this category of services.
