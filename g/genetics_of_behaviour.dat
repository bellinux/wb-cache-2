50|$|Promptov {{was born}} in the family of a {{high-ranking}} Russian revenue official. He went to school in Kostroma and graduated from the Nechaev gymnasium in Moscow. Even as a young boy, he took an interest in birds but he chose to study experimental zoology rather than ornithology. It is thought that his choice may have been aided by family ties to Nikolai Koltsov. Promptov's and Koltsov's mothers were related and Koltsov influenced the authorities to let Promptov study the genetics of fowl under Aleksandr Serebrovskii, a former student of Koltsov, in a project funded by the People's Commissariat of Agriculture. Promptov graduated in 1923 and joined the University in the department of genetics. He contributed to a translation of T.H. Morgan's Physical Basis of Heredity into Russian and joined Sergei Chetverikov's research team working on Drosophila. In 1926 he started research at Moscow University's Institute of Zoology on pleiotropism and polymorphism in Drosophila genetics. Throughout this period, he continued to take an interest in field ornithology and began to explore many aspects of avian biology including song learning and hybridization of finches. After defending his dissertation in 1929 he made a trip to the Urals to study song variation in several bird species. Returning after two months, he took up a job of a lecturer in general biology. He gradually intensified his studies in ornithology and in 1937 he produced a 400 page manual of field ornithology, Птицы в природе ("birds in nature") which is still considered a classic. It included calls described in his own notations. Promptov also pioneered bird sound recording in the USSR with an instrument that made use of photographic film. In 1940 he moved to an Ornithological Laboratory at the Institute of Evolutionary Physiology and Pathology of Higher Nervous Activity which had been established in Koltushi by Ivan Pavlov and then directed by his student Leon Orbeli. He began to study species specific stereotyped behaviour in birds but the war broke out. Promptov stayed at the Institute through the war and after the war, he was visited by Julian Huxley who reported that it was the only work on the <b>genetics</b> <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> in wild birds that he knew of. On November 11, 1948 Promptov committed suicide. Some of his work was posthumously published by his wife Elizaveta Lukina (who was also a research collaborator).|$|E

The {{interest}} of including behavioural traits in selection {{has been only}} recently underlined. Moreover, {{it is a difficult}} question to tackle in horses as animals are dispersed in a variety of environmental conditions. There are some undirect indications based on comparisons of breeds or families. Behavioural similarities in animals issued from the same sire or belonging to the same breed are oberserved in foals and adult horses both in freely expressed behaviours (play, distance to the dam) as well as in reactions to experimental situations (emotional or learning tests). Stereotypic behaviours seem to appear more frequently in some breeds and / or families. The relative weight of environmental and genetic factors on the determinism of behavioural traits seems to differ according to the trait being considered. Moreover the observed differences between families or breeds can as well be related to epigenetic factors (maternal effect for example). It seems possible and promising to include behaviour in horse selection but it is necessary to have clear objectives in the trait seeked, the way it can be measured and to evaluate the impact of environmental factors...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Polymorphism in {{genes of}} {{regulating}} enzymes, transporters and receptors of the neurotransmitters {{of the central}} nervous system have been associated with altered behaviour, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) represent the most frequent type of genetic variation. The serotonin and dopamine signalling systems have a central influence on different behavioural phenotypes, both of invertebrates and vertebrates, and this study was undertaken in order to explore genetic variation that may be associated with variation in behaviour. Results Single nucleotide polymorphisms in canine genes related to behaviour were identified by individually sequencing eight dogs (Canis familiaris) of different breeds. Eighteen genes from the dopamine and the serotonin systems were screened, revealing 34 SNPs distributed in 14 of the 18 selected genes. A total of 24, 895 bp coding sequence was sequenced yielding an average frequency of one SNP per 732 bp (1 / 732). A total of 11 non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs), which may be involved in alteration of protein function, were detected. Of these 11 nsSNPs, six resulted in a substitution of amino acid residue with concomitant change in structural parameters. Conclusion We have identified a number of coding SNPs in behaviour-related genes, several of which change the amino acids of the proteins. Some of the canine SNPs exist in codons that are evolutionary conserved between five compared species, and predictions indicate that they may have a functional effect on the protein. The reported coding SNP frequency of the studied genes falls within the range of SNP frequencies reported earlier in the dog and other mammalian species. Novel SNPs are presented and the results show a significant genetic variation in expressed sequences in this group of genes. The results can contribute to an improved understanding of the <b>genetics</b> <b>of</b> <b>behaviour.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{nematode}} C. elegans is {{an ideal}} model-organism to study the <b>genetics</b> <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> (Brenner, 1974). It is capable of sensing salts and we discriminate three different responses: it is attracted to low salt concentrations (Ward, 1973; Dusenbery et al., 1974), it avoids high salt concentrations that give osmotic problems (Culotti & Russell, 1978), and the response to NaCl shows plasticity: normally attractive salt concentrations are avoided after pre-exposure to salt (Saeki et al., 2001; Jansen et al., 2002). The goal {{of this study was}} to unravel the molecular mechanisms and the cellular circuitry behind the different responses of C. elegans to NaCl. A candidate gene approach was used in which mutants for 123 genes were tested for their role in salt responses. A complete overview of all genes tested is given in the Chapter 5. We found 22 genes involved in attraction, 57 genes involved in avoidance and 87 genes involved in gustatory plasticity. Several of the most interesting results were followed up and are discussed in this thesis. In Chapter 1, a summary is given of what is known about the molecular mechanisms of taste, an introduction to C. elegans as a model organism, and a brief overview of the C. elegans nervous system and neurotransmission. Furthermore, various sensory behaviours of C. elegans and their plasticity are discussed. Chapter 2 focuses on chemotaxis to NaCl and discusses five newly identified genes, which function in two genetic pathways that mediate NaCl chemotaxis. Chapter 3 discusses the role of G protein signalling in gustatory plasticity and identifies multiple neurons as well as a genetic pathway involved in this process. Chapter 4 discusses the roles of different neurotransmitters in the different responses of C. elegans to NaCl. An overall discussion and summary are given in the final chapter. Taken together, this study provides new insights into the processes of NaCl chemotaxis and its plasticity in C. elegans. We expect that these insights can be extrapolated to mammals...|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} much {{progress}} has been made towards understanding the selective forces involved in the evolution <b>of</b> social <b>behaviour</b> including conflicts over reproduction among group members. Here, I argue that an important additional step necessary for advancing our understanding of the resolution of potential conflicts within insect societies is to consider the <b>genetics</b> <b>of</b> the <b>behaviours</b> involved. First, I discuss how epigenetic modifications <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> may affect conflict resolution within groups. Second, I review known natural polymorphisms of social organization to demonstrate that a lack of consideration of the genetic mechanisms involved may lead to erroneous explanations of the adaptive significance <b>of</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Third, I suggest that, on the basis of recent genetic studies of sexual conflict in Drosophila, it is necessary to reconsider the possibility of within-group manipulation by means of chemical substances (i. e. pheromones). Fourth, I address the issue of direct versus indirect genetic effects, which is of particular importance for the study <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> in social groups. Fifth, I discuss the issue of how a genetic influence on dominance hierarchies and reproductive division of labour can have secondary effects, for example in the evolution of promiscuity. Finally, because the same sets of genes (e. g. those implicated in chemical signalling and the responses that are triggered) may be used even in species as divergent as ants, cooperative breeding birds and primates, an integration of genetic mechanisms into the field of social evolution may also provide unifying ideas...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, the {{zebrafish}} has been proven to be an excellent model to investigate the genetic control of vertebrate embryonic development, {{and it is now}} also increasingly used to study behaviour and adult physiology.

Combined with the classical strengths of the zebrafish as a model organism, these advances are set to substantially expand the type of biological questions that can be addressed in this species. In this review, we outline how the potential of the zebrafish can be harvested in the context of eye development and visual function.

40|$|Abstract Background Detecting {{functional}} variants {{contributing to}} diversity <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> {{is crucial for}} dissecting <b>genetics</b> <b>of</b> complex <b>behaviours.</b> At a molecular level, characterisation of variation in exons has been studied as they are easily identified in the current genome annotation although the functional consequences are less well understood; however, it {{has been difficult to}} prioritise regions of non-coding DNA in which genetic variation could also have significant functional consequences. Comparison of multiple vertebrate genomes has allowed the identification of non-coding evolutionary conserved regions (ECRs), in which the degree of conservation can be comparable with exonic regions suggesting functional significance. Results We identified ECRs at the dopamine receptor D 4 gene locus, an important gene for human behaviours. The most conserved non-coding ECR (D 4 ECR 1) supported high reporter gene expression in primary cultures derived from neonate rat frontal cortex. Computer aided analysis of the sequence of the D 4 ECR 1 indicated the potential transcription factors that could modulate its function. D 4 ECR 1 contained multiple consensus sequences for binding the transcription factor Sp 1, a factor previously implicated in DRD 4 expression. Co-transfection experiments demonstrated that overexpression of Sp 1 significantly decreased the activity of the D 4 ECR 1 in vitro. Conclusion Bioinformatic analysis complemented by functional analysis of the DRD 4 gene locus has identified a) a strong enhancer that functions in neurons and b) a transcription factor that may modulate the function of that enhancer. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: From middle {{childhood}} onwards, {{substantial evidence}} points to phenotypic differentiation between anxiety diagnostic categories such as generalised anxiety, separation anxiety, specific phobia, and obsessive-compulsive disorders. However, {{little is known about}} the <b>genetics</b> <b>of</b> these categories and especially about the phenotypic and genetic structure <b>of</b> related <b>behaviours</b> in pre-school children. Methods: We examined the phenotypic differentiation and <b>genetics</b> <b>of</b> mother-reported anxiety-related <b>behaviours</b> in 4, 564 four-year-old twin pairs, from a population-based sample. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses provided support for five correlated factors: General Distress, Separation Anxiety, Fears, Obsessive-Compulsive Behaviours, and Shyness/Inhibition. Genetic influences were found on all five factors, but the pattern of influences differed considerably across them, with particularly high heritability estimates for Obsessive-Compulsive Behaviours and Shyness/Inhibition, and substantial shared environmental influence on Separation Anxiety. Multivariate genetic analyses revealed moderate genetic correlations between the five factors. Genetic overlap was particularly pronounced between General Distress and the other anxiety-related behaviours, accounting for about half of their covariance. Genetic variance on Obsessive-Compulsive Behaviours was the least correlated with the other scales. The shared environmental influences correlated highly across the factors, accounting for the greatest proportion of covariation between Separation Anxiety, Fears and Obsessive-Compulsive Behaviours. The non-shared environment influences were largely variable specific. Conclusions: These data provide evidence for phenotypic and genetic overlap as well as differentiation between aspects <b>of</b> anxiety-related <b>behaviours</b> in young children. We conclude that research with young children will benefit from more specific assessments <b>of</b> anxiety-related <b>behaviours</b> in addition to less differentiated assessments of 'internalising' symptoms...|$|R

40|$|Insect {{workers can}} {{increase}} their inclusive fitness by biasing colony sex allocation towards males when their mother queen is mated to multiple {{males and females}} when she is singly mated. Workers need heritable variation in odour diversity to assess queen mating frequency. Here we present a simple one-locus two-allele model, which shows that the sex ratio specialization itself will often select against rare alleles that would provide additional information {{for the assessment of}} queen mating frequency. However, under certain rather restricted conditions, such as when sex ratios are highly female biased, and when worker reproduction is rare, sex ratio specialization can select for rare alleles. This suggests that sex allocation biasing by workers will usually reduce the very information that workers need to assess queen mating frequency. Our model is an example where an explicit treatment <b>of</b> underlying <b>genetics</b> and mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>behaviour,</b> such as information use, is necessary to fully understand the evolution of an adaptive behavioural strategy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{approach}} {{the problem of}} the evolution of bird migration by asking whether migration evolves towards new breeding areas or towards survival areas in the non-breeding season. Thus, we avoid the ambiguity of the usually discussed “southern-home-theory ” or “northern-home-theory”. We argue that migration evolved in birds that spread to seasonal habitats through gradual dispersal to enhance survival during the non-breeding season; this in contrast to the alternative idea suggesting that migration evolved towards new breeding areas to increase reproduc-tive success. Our synthesis is based on the threshold model explaining how migratory traits can change rapidly through microevolutionary processes. Our model brings former theories together and explains how bird migration, with the appropriate direction and time program, evolves through selection after genetically non-directed events such as dispersal and colonization. The model does not need the former untested assumptions such as competition as a reason for migration and for the disappearance of sedentary populations or higher reproductive success in temperate breeding areas. Our theory offers answers to questions such as how birds with a southern origin may gradually reach northern latitudes, why migration routes may follow historical expansion routes and why birds leave an area for the non-breeding season and move back instead of breeding on their wintering grounds. The theory proposes gradual change through selection and not sudden changes such as long distance dispersal or mutations and can be applied to migration at all latitudes and in all directions. The scenario provides a reasonable concept to understand most of the existing migratory phenomena {{on the basis of the}} ecology and <b>genetics</b> <b>of</b> migratory <b>behaviour...</b>|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} goals in current {{evolutionary}} biology research is to identify genes behind adaptive phenotypic variations. The advances in genomic technologies {{have made it possible}} to identify genetic loci behind these variations, also concerning non-model species. This thesis investigates the <b>genetics</b> <b>of</b> the <b>behaviour</b> and other adaptive traits of the nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) through the application of different genetic approaches. Fennoscandian nine-spined stickleback populations express large phenotypical differences especially in behaviour, life –history traits and morphology. However the underlying genetic bases for these phenotypical differences have not been studied in detail. The results of the project will lay the foundation for further genetics studies and provide valuable information for our understanding <b>of</b> the <b>genetics</b> <b>of</b> the adaptive divergence of the nine-spined stickleback. A candidate gene approach was used to develop microsatellite markers situating close to candidate genes for behaviour in the nine-spined stickleback. Altogether 13 markers were developed and these markers were used in the subsequent studies with the anonymous random markers and physiologically important gene markers which are already currently available for nine-spined sticklebacks. It was shown that heterozygosity correlated with <b>behaviour</b> in one <b>of</b> the marine nine-spined stickleback populations but with contrasting effects: correlations with behaviour were negative when using physiological gene markers and positive with random markers. No correlation was found between behavioural markers and behaviour. From the physiological gene markers, a strong correlation was found between osmoregulation-related gene markers and behaviour. These results indicate that both local (physiological) and general (random) effects are important in the shaping <b>of</b> <b>behaviour</b> and that heterozygosity– behaviour correlations are population dependent. In this thesis a second linkage map for nine-spined sticklebacks was constructed. Compared to the earlier nine-spined stickleback linkage map, genomic rearrangements were observed between autosomal (LG 7) and sex-determing (LG 12) linkage groups. This newly constructed map was used in QTL mapping studies in order to locate genomic regions associated with pelvic structures, behaviour and body size/growth. One major QTL was found for pelvic structures and Pitx 1 gene was related to these traits as was predicted from three-spined stickleback studies, but this was in contrast to earlier nine-spined stickleback study. The QTL studies also revealed that behaviour and body size/growth were genetically more complex by having more QTL than pelvic traits. However, in many cases, pelvic structure, body size/growth and behaviour were linked to similar map locations indicating possible pleiotropic effects of genes locating in these QTL regions. Many of the gene related markers resided in the QTL area. In the future, studying these possible candidate genes in depth might reveal the underlying mechanism behind the measured traits...|$|R

40|$|Suicidal behaviours, {{which range}} from suicidal {{ideation}} to suicide attempts and completed suicide, represent a fatal dimension of mental ill-health. The involvement of genetic risk factors in suicidal behaviour is supported by family, twin, and adoption studies. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review recent genetic association studies in suicidal behaviours including (i) case-control studies, (ii) family-based association studies and (iii) genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Various studies on genetic associations have tended to suggest that a number of genes (e. g., tryptophan hydroxylase, serotonin receptors and transporters or brain-derived neurotrophic factors) are linked to suicidal behaviours, but these findings are not consistently supported by the results obtained. Although the candidate-gene approach is useful, it is hampered by the present state of knowledge concerning the pathophysiology of diseases. Interpretations of GWAS results are mostly hindered by a lack of annotation describing the functions of most variation throughout the genome. Association studies have addressed a wide range of SNPs in numerous genes. We have included 104 such studies, of which 10 are family-based association studies and 11 are GWAS studies. Numerous meta-analyses of case-control studies have shown significant associations <b>of</b> suicidal <b>behaviour</b> with variants in the serotonin transporter gene (5 -HTT or SLC 6 A 4) and the tryptophane hydroxylase 1 gene (TPH 1), but others report contradictory results. The gene encoding brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor (NTRK 2) are also promising candidates. Only two of the GWAS studies showed any significant associations. Several pathways are mentioned in an attempt to understand the lack of reproducibility and the disappointing results.
