5|$|After {{leaving the}} main line {{immediately}} south of Hellingly, the railway passed over <b>gated</b> level crossings at Park Road and New Road.

The line climbed most of the way from here to the hospital at 1 in 50. About halfway between Hellingly and the hospital the line entered the hospital grounds, passing to the west of Park House Siding, which served the hospital's Park House annexe.|$|E
5|$|An early theory, the Meyer-Overton hypothesis, {{suggested}} that narcosis {{happens when the}} gas penetrates the lipids of the brain's nerve cells, causing direct mechanical interference with the {{transmission of signals from}} one nerve cell to another. More recently, specific types of chemically <b>gated</b> receptors in nerve cells have been identified as being involved with anesthesia and narcosis. However, the basic and most general underlying idea, that nerve transmission is altered in many diffuse areas of the brain as a result of gas molecules dissolved in the nerve cells' fatty membranes, remains largely unchallenged.|$|E

5|$|Beavers, rodents {{weighing}} up to , have sometimes caused problems along Fanno Creek. In 2014 and 2015, a growing population of beavers gnawed down trees and dammed the creek in Greenway Park in Beaverton. Rising waters have covered {{one of the}} side trails in the park, which has been <b>gated</b> and closed. During heavy rains, water from the beaver pond sometimes covers the main trail. Park officials are considering a variety of options, including re-routing the trails, building a boardwalk over the water, or removing the beaver dams.|$|E

5|$|When {{the park}} was {{enclosed}} in 1637 there were six <b>gates</b> in the boundary wall: Coombe <b>Gate,</b> Ham <b>Gate,</b> Richmond <b>Gate,</b> Robin Hood <b>Gate,</b> Roehampton <b>Gate</b> and Sheen <b>Gate.</b> Of these, Richmond <b>Gate</b> has the heaviest traffic. The present <b>gates</b> were designed by Sir John Soane and were widened in 1896.

Coombe <b>Gate</b> (later known as Ladderstile <b>Gate)</b> provided access to the park for the parishioners of Coombe, with both a <b>gate</b> and a step ladder. The <b>gate</b> was locked in the early 1700s and bricked up in about 1735. The stepladder was reinstated after John Lewis's case in 1758 and remained in place until about 1884. The present <b>gate</b> dates from 1901. The present wrought iron <b>gates</b> of Roehampton <b>Gate</b> were installed in 1899. Ham <b>Gate</b> was widened in 1921, when the present wrought iron <b>gates</b> were installed. The chinoiserie lantern lights over the <b>gate</b> were installed in 1825.|$|R

5|$|Pound lock: Indirect {{evidence}} suggests that pound locks {{may have been used}} in antiquity by the Ptolemaic Greeks and the Romans. In China, although the one gate canal flash lock existed beforehand, the two-gate pound lock was invented in 984 by an official of Huainan and engineer named Qiao Weiyo, during the early Song Dynasty (960–1279), so that ships could safely travel along canal waterways having <b>gated</b> and segmented chambers where water levels could be regulated. The economic and transport benefits of this innovation were described by the polymath official and inventor Shen Kuo (1031–1095) in his Dream Pool Essays.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 1950s, {{development}} of highways and new housing led to movement of middle class to suburbs in West Omaha. Some {{of the movement}} was designated as white flight from racial unrest in the 1960s. Newer and poorer migrants lived in older housing close to downtown; those residents who were more established moved west into newer housing. Some suburbs are <b>gated</b> communities or have become edge cities.

5|$|The Town of Hilton Head Island {{incorporated}} as a municipality in 1983 and is {{well known}} for its eco-friendly development. The town's Natural Resources Division enforces the Land Management Ordinance which minimizes the impact of development and governs the style of buildings and how they are situated amongst existing trees. As a result, Hilton Head Island enjoys an unusual amount of tree cover relative to the amount of development. Approximately 70% of the island, including most of the tourist areas, is located inside <b>gated</b> communities. However, the town maintains several public beach access points, including one for the exclusive use of town residents, who have approved several multimillion-dollar land-buying bond referendums to control commercial growth.|$|E

5|$|The peak random write {{performance}} on an SSD {{is driven by}} plenty of free blocks after the SSD is completely garbage collected, secure erased, 100% TRIMed, or newly installed. The maximum speed will depend upon the number of parallel flash channels connected to the SSD controller, {{the efficiency of the}} firmware, and the speed of the flash memory in writing to a page. During this phase the write amplification will be the best it can ever be for random writes and will be approaching one. Once the blocks are all written once, garbage collection will begin and the performance will be <b>gated</b> by the speed and efficiency of that process. Write amplification in this phase will increase to the highest levels the drive will experience.|$|E
