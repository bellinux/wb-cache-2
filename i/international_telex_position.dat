50|$|Signalling {{is needed}} to {{determine}} the start and end of a call, and the destination of the connection. Two systems have been used, signalling system B CCITT U1 and CCITT U20. An <b>international</b> <b>telex</b> exchange would have signalling conversion facilities.|$|R
50|$|High-speed newspaper-page-facsimile {{equipment}} and Chinese character - code translation equipment were {{used on a}} large scale. Sixty-four-channel program-controlled automatic message retransmission {{equipment and}} low- or medium-speed data transmission and exchange equipment also received extensive use. <b>International</b> <b>telex</b> service was available in coastal cities and special economic zones.|$|R
5000|$|... ln 1975, the <b>International</b> <b>Telex</b> Exchange was opened, {{allowing}} {{businesses to}} send telexes. Four years later, International Direct Dialling (IDD) services were introduced {{and the first}} electronic exchange was commissioned in Johor Bahru. The volume of new development was such that, in the early 1980s, the Department was compelled to appoint contractors to help build new lines and extend the cable network.|$|R
5000|$|... "International Record Carrier" [...] (IRC) was a term {{created by}} the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States. Bell's {{original}} consent agreement limited it to international dial telephony. The Western Union Telegraph Company had given up its international telegraphic operation in a 1939 bid to monopolize U.S. telegraphy by taking over ITT's PTT business. The result was a de-emphasis on telex in the U.S. and a [...] "cat's cradle" [...] of <b>international</b> <b>telex</b> and telegraphy companies, the IRCs.|$|R
50|$|Canada-wide {{automatic}} teleprinter exchange {{service was}} introduced by the CPR Telegraph Company and CN Telegraph in July 1957 (the two companies, operated by rivals Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway, would join to form CNCP Telecommunications in 1967). This service supplemented the existing <b>international</b> <b>telex</b> service that {{was put in place}} in November 1956. Canadian telex customers could connect with nineteen European countries in addition to eighteen Latin American, African, and trans-Pacific countries. The major exchanges were located in Montreal (01), Toronto (02), and Winnipeg (03).|$|R
40|$|Introduction 1. 1 Scope 1. 1. 1 These {{provisions}} fix {{the rules}} to be followed in the <b>international</b> <b>telex</b> service. Telex is a telegraph service for subscribers whereby they can communicate directly and temporarily between themselves using start-stop telegraph equipment operating at 50 bauds and with International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2. 1. 1. 2 Questions of an essentially technical nature concerning the telex service are dealt with by other CCITT Recommendations. 1. 2 Definitions 1. 2. 1 The following terms used in these provisions have the undermentioned definitions: emergency routes F: voies de secours S: rutas de emergencia The circuit(s) {{to be used in}} case of complete interruption or major breakdown of the primary and secondary routes. The emergency routes may pass through any country. Government telex calls F: communications telex d'Etat S: comunicaciones telex de Estado Fascicle II. 4 [...] - Rec. F. 60...|$|R
50|$|In 1958, Western Union {{started to}} build a telex network in the United States. This telex network started as a {{satellite}} exchange located in New York City and expanded to a nationwide network. Western Union chose Siemens & Halske AG, now Siemens AG, and ITT to supply the exchange equipment, provisioned the exchange trunks via the Western Union national microwave system and leased the exchange to customer site facilities from the local telephone company. Teleprinter equipment was originally provided by Siemens & Halske AG and later by Teletype Corporation. Initial direct <b>international</b> <b>telex</b> service was offered by Western Union, via W.U. International, {{in the summer of}} 1960 with limited service to London and Paris. In 1962, the major exchanges were located in New York City (1), Chicago (2), San Francisco (3), Kansas City (4) and Atlanta (5). The telex network expanded by adding the final parent exchanges cities of Los Angeles (6), Dallas (7), Philadelphia (8) and Boston (9) starting in 1966.|$|R
50|$|Earlier in {{his career}} he was {{affiliated}} with Brooke Group, a Leveraged buyout firm controlled by Bennett S. LeBow. Investor Bennett S. LeBow acquired control of Western Union through an outside of chapter 11 process that included the concurrent acquisition of the <b>international</b> <b>telex</b> operations of ITT {{as part of a}} complex leveraged recapitalization that was financed by Drexel Burnham and Michael Milken in a process that included many prominent investors who had also attempted to acquire control including Richard Rainwater and Jay Pritzker. LeBow installed Schriesheim at Western Union from 1987 to 1990 as a special adviser to CEO Robert J. Amman to help oversee a strategic, operational and balance sheet restructuring of the company. They executed a strategy of redirecting Western Union from being an asset-based provider of communications services into a provider of consumer-based money transfer financial services. Schriesheim focused his attention on the divestiture of the non-strategic telecommunications assets. Ultimately, LeBow's $25 million investment to acquire control of Western Union in 1987 was rewarded when the company was acquired by First Financial Management in 1993 for $1.15 billion also making Carl Icahn a return of 3 to 4 times his investment in the bonds in the process. First Financial Management was subsequently acquired in 1995 by First Data Corp in a $6.6 billion merger).|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceThe <b>Telex</b> {{middleware}} {{facilitates the}} design of collaborative applications in a mobile environment. It provides optimistic replication, tentative execution and disconnected work. It solves conflicts based on semantic information provided by applications. We study in particular a Shared Calendar (SC) application, whereby mobile users can create and manage meetings {{in a collection of}} shared calendars. The application provides Telex with objects representing (1) meeting creation and modification operations (actions), (2) dependence or conflict information between actions (constraints). When a conflict occurs, Telex proposes solutions to users. The advantage of this approach is a clean separation of concerns. The SC application writer concentrates on application logic, whereas Telex takes care of replication, consistency, conflicts, and commitment across all applications...|$|R
50|$|Purchasing {{a divided}} {{national}} phone market along roughly equal {{sides of a}} north-south line, each company was given an initial, 7 year monopoly beginning November 8, 1990. At the same time, other companies were given exclusive licences for <b>international</b> long distance, <b>telex</b> and cellular phone service. ENTel remained in existence {{for a number of}} years as a residuary body, running off existing contracts and completing the details of its sale.|$|R
50|$|The {{night before}} the October 21, 1967 March on the Pentagon, Bloom, Mungo and the other staffers convened a chaotic meeting in a Washington loft with {{underground}} press editors {{from around the country}} who were in town to cover the march; but they failed to reach an agreement to create a democratic structure in which LNS would be owned and run by its member papers. Operating on their own with a volunteer staff of 12, Bloom and Mungo moved forward with ambitious plans for the expansion of LNS. In December they opened an <b>international</b> <b>Telex</b> line to Oxford, England; and later that winter LNS merged with the Student Communications Network (SCN), based in Berkeley, which had its own nationwide Telex network with terminals in Berkeley, Los Angeles, New York, Ann Arbor, Ames, Iowa, Chicago and Philadelphia, leased from Western Union. In February 1968 LNS took over the SCN office in New York, which had just been opened by former Columbia graduate student George Cavalletto and others in a converted Chinese restaurant on Claremont Avenue in Harlem. Walking by, Steve Diamond saw a brand new Telex machine sitting in an otherwise empty storefront and a sign seeking volunteers, and attended a meeting shortly afterward at which the New York staff was formed. Two months after it opened the New York office became a central focus for LNS activity during the Columbia University student uprising in April 1968, as a continual stream of bulletins going out over the Telex kept underground papers and radio stations across country up to the minute on the latest developments in the Columbia strike. To young radicals across the country {{it seemed as if the}} revolution had come.|$|R
50|$|Forced {{entry into}} homes and offices and the {{planting}} of microphones was another tactic the Securitate used to extract {{information from the}} general population. Telephone conversations were routinely monitored, and all internal and <b>international</b> fax and <b>telex</b> communications were intercepted. After coal miners' unions went on strike and several leaders died prematurely, it was later discovered that Securitate doctors had subjected them to five-minute chest X-rays {{in an attempt to}} have them develop cancer. After birth rates fell, Securitate agents were placed in gynecological wards while regular pregnancy tests were made mandatory for women of child-bearing age, with severe penalties for anyone who was found to have terminated a pregnancy.|$|R
