25|$|By all accounts, Smith was a well-respected and even-tempered man. However Bogan's taunts {{began to}} wear on Smith, who {{eventually}} climbed down from his wagon and headed toward Bogan. As Smith walked toward Bogan, the latter stuck his <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> coat. Smith told {{him that if he}} pulled his gun, he'd knock him to the ground. Bogan did pull his pistol, at which point Smith did knock him down with one punch. The two then wrestled briefly before Smith was able to take the young man's gun from him. As he did this, Kemp ran over producing his own handgun, and hit Smith {{in the back of the}} head. Smith then turned and pointed his pistol at Kemp, and pulled the trigger. However, the pistol misfired, according to witnesses, and Kemp fled at top speed. Smith turned Bogan's pistol over to the town marshal.|$|E
2500|$|During a September 2016 {{appearance}} on the radio show El Show de Piolín, Fox smashed a Trump piñata hanging {{on the streets of}} Los Angeles while loudly singing the traditional Piñata song. Upon breaking it open, Fox noted its lack of contents and remarked, [...] "Empty. Totally Empty. He doesn't have any brains." [...] Discussing the event during a subsequent interview with GQ, Fox expanded, [...] "I had such a joy in my heart by doing that, because in Mexico, piñatas are very meaningful. Piñatas are a celebration. Piñatas let you send messages. And the message is: Trump is empty inside. He's empty in his head. That's why I put my <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> head. There was no brain there. That's what he is, an empty person." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fifth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God {{directed}} Moses to tell Israel's elders what God had promised, and predicted {{that they would}} heed Moses and go with him to tell Pharaoh that God had met with them and request that Pharaoh allow them to go three days' journey into the wilderness to sacrifice to God. God knew that Pharaoh would not let them go unless forced by a mighty hand, so God would strike Egypt with wonders, and then Pharaoh would let them go. God would make the Egyptians view the Israelites favorably, so that the Israelites would not leave empty handed, but every woman would ask her neighbor for jewels and clothing and the Israelites would strip the Egyptians. Moses predicted {{that they would not}} believe him, so God told him to cast his rod on the ground, and it became a serpent, and Moses fled from it. God told Moses to take it by the tail, he did so, and it became a rod again. God explained that this was so that they might believe that God had appeared to Moses. Then God told Moses to put his <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> bosom, he did, and when he took it out, his hand was leprous, as white as snow. God told him to put his hand back into his bosom, he did, and when he took it out, it had returned to normal. God predicted that if they would not heed the first sign, then they would believe the second sign, and if they would not believe those two signs, then Moses was to take water from the river and pour it on the land, and the water would become blood. Moses protested that he was not a man of words but was slow of speech, but God asked him who had made man's mouth, so Moses should go, and God would teach him what to say. Moses pleaded with God to send someone else, and God became angry with Moses. God said that Moses' well-spoken brother Aaron was coming to meet him, Moses would tell him the words that God would teach them, he would be Moses' spokesman, and Moses would be like God to him. And God told Moses to take his staff with him to perform signs. The fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah) and the fourth open portion ( [...] , petuchah) end here.|$|E
