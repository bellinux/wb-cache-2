5000|$|HSR-II (1989) — The second {{generation}} had a {{heavy emphasis on}} active aerodynamics, {{with a series of}} movable fins and spoilers offering a <b>drag</b> <b>factor</b> which varied from 0.20 to 0.40 depending on setup. Much of the technology found its way to the Mitsubishi HSX, the precursor to the company's GTO sports car. It is also featured in the games Gran Turismo 4, Gran Turismo 5 and Gran Turismo 6.|$|E
50|$|Designs for the XJ40 pioneered {{significant}} improvements to how Jaguar cars were designed, built, and assembled. Among these improvements was a 25 per cent {{reduction in the}} number of bodywork panels required per car (e.g. three pressings needed for a Series 3 door compared with one for a XJ40 door), resulting in not only a more efficient assembly process, but also a weight saving and a stiffer structure. Greater attention to panel gaps improved the <b>drag</b> <b>factor</b> (reduced from 0.849 Cd to 0.762 Cd), while also improving the fuel economy and lowering wind noise inside the cabin.|$|E
50|$|The {{reasons for}} this complex system were threefold. One was to {{eliminate}} any extra aerodynamic drag that a protruding oil cooler would produce, in this case eliminating the extra <b>drag</b> <b>factor</b> by enclosing it within the engine's forward cowling. The second was to warm the air before it flowed to the oil cooler's circular-shaped core to aid warming the oil during starting. Finally, by placing the oil cooler behind the fan, cooling was provided even while the aircraft was parked. The downside to this design was that the oil cooler was in an extremely vulnerable location, and the metal ring was increasingly armoured as the war progressed.|$|E

Potential-theoretic methods are used to reduce each problem to the solution of coupled infinite sets of linear equations, and approximations are then computed for the torque and <b>drag</b> <b>factors</b> appropri-ate to rotation and translation.

50|$|Unfortunately {{after first}} tests were done, the low {{pressure}} area under the car {{was found to be}} too far forward, requiring a very large rear wing to be designed resulting in a lot of drag at high speeds. This was especially noticeable on fast tracks such as Hockenheim and the Österreichring, where the Ferraris and McLarens were much faster than the 78. To compensate, Ford provided development versions of the Ford Cosworth DFV, increasing the car's speed but also sacrificing reliability. Andretti had no fewer than five engine failures in 1977, costing him the world championship to Niki Lauda, even though he had won four races and taken six pole positions to Lauda's three wins. Eventually a smaller wing was designed in time for the Italian Grand Prix (see above picture), which cut the <b>drag</b> <b>factor</b> significantly, and allowed Andretti to take a popular 'home' victory.|$|E

Qasim et al.[17] worked with impeller scoop-frame type with movable vanes wind turbine (VAWT). The objective was to maximize the <b>drag</b> <b>factor</b> by closing the vanes on convex shape and opening when air hits the concave part. Due to the movement of vanes for and against the wind, a higher <b>drag</b> <b>factor</b> is worked on the impeller scoop-frame type with movable vanes and has higher efficiency than flat vanes.|$|E

The final results of this study show that this method produces better evaluations of resistance for relatively high-speed vessels than previous methods and compares reasonably well with model test results for motions.

40|$|A {{microscopic}} {{theory of}} a non-dissipative drag in a two-component superfluid Bose gas is developed. The expression for the drag current {{in the system}} with the components of different atomic masses, densities and scattering lengths is derived. It is shown that the drag current {{is proportional to the}} square root of the gas parameter. The temperature dependence of the drag current is studied and it is shown that at temperature of order or smaller than the interaction energy the temperature reduction of the drag current is rather small. A possible way of measuring the <b>drag</b> <b>factor</b> is proposed. A toroidal system with the drag component confined in two half-ring wells separated by two Josephson barriers is considered. Under certain condition such a system can be treated as a Bose-Einstein counterpart of the Josephson charge qubit in an external magnetic field.

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{relation}} between maximal anaerobic power output and 2, 000 m test on rowing ergometer and relation between 6, 000 m test and 2, 000 m on rowing ergometer. It can be assumed that 2, 000 m performance on rowing ergometer will significantly correlate with maximal anaerobic power output and 6, 000 m performance. A group of 9 welltrained rowers (age: 18. 3 years ± 2. 8 years, sport age: 4. 9 years ± 3. 7 years, weight: 78. 9 kg ± 12. 2 kg, height: 182. 3 cm ± 7. 6 cm) performed three tests in 1 week to determine maximal anaerobic power, 6, 000 m and 2, 000 m performance on Concept 2 model D rowing ergometer. A value of simple maximal stroke out of 10 -second all-out test with <b>drag</b> <b>factor</b> set to 200 was taken as a measure of maximal anaerobic power. <b>Drag</b> <b>factor</b> for 6, 000 m and 2, 000 m test was set individually.

Maximal anaerobic power and 6, 000 m tests seem to be good predictors for 2, 000 m score on rowing ergometer.
