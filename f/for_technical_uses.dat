As yet such procedures exist, based only on empirical studies omitting the reaction behaviour of the joining materials and the specific properties of the reaction products. For this reason the reaction behaviour of silicon carbide with selected metals and subsequently the compatibility of these reaction layers with the ceramic substrate were investigated. The results gained were then applied to silicon carbide joints using intermediate metallic layers.

40|$|International audienceThe {{expected}} {{value of the}} annual flood is always needed for attaining reliable estimates of the return period of floods. In particular, the accuracy of its estimate is crucial for ungauged basins, where regional analysis is to be invoked. The main goal {{of this research was}} to search for an index flood formula suitable to explicate the influence of basin characteristics such as geomorphology, vegetation, soil and climate. This formula, due to unavoidable overparameterization, more than being suggested <b>for</b> <b>technical</b> <b>use,</b> allows sensitivity analyses of simpler formulae to basin features. This study was mainly based on the theoretical distribution of floods developed by Iacobellis and Fiorentino (2000). In particular, the relationship that they derived for the first order moment was analyzed and simplified by assuming the Gumbel distribution as a first order approximation for the distributions of floods and rainfall intensities. The results were validated with regard to data recorded in some basins located in Southern Italy, in a climatically end geologically heterogeneous territory...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} two decades it was shown that plants have a great {{potential}} for production of specific heterologous proteins. But high cost and inefficient downstream processing are a main <b>technical</b> bottleneck <b>for</b> the broader use of plant-based production technology especially for protein-based products, <b>for</b> <b>technical</b> <b>use</b> as fibres or biodegradable plastics and also for medical applications. High-performance fibres from recombinant spider silks are, therefore, a prominent example. Spiders developed rather different silk materials that are based on proteins. These spider silks show excellent properties in terms of elasticity and toughness. Natural spider silk proteins have a very high molecular weight, and it is precisely this property which is thought to give them their strength. Transgenic plants were generated to produce ELPylated recombinant spider silk derivatives. These fusion proteins were purified by Inverse Transition Cycling (ITC) and enzymatically multimerized with transglutaminase in vitro. Layers produced by casting monomers and multimers were characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and AFM-based nanoindentation.

40|$|The {{investigations}} {{were part}} of the co-operative project 'Monotectic Alloys', in which nine other institutions participated. Their work had to be coordinated, too. In the project the separation behaviour of monotectic alloys should be studied during their decomposition in the liquid state by experiments in space and on earth to enable them <b>for</b> <b>technical</b> <b>use.</b> Therefore the separation process, especially transport and growth of the droplets developing during decomposition by passing the miscibility gap was studied in dependence from the cooling rate and the temperature-gradient. An influence of the crucible-wettability on the sepration process was proven, but above all, the Marangoni-transport determined the movement and, due to coagulation, the growth of the minority-phase-droplets. This mechanism overlaps the transport induced by the solidification front and is difficult to separate from it. Evaluations based on the results and using theories known for the Marangoni-transport show good agreement with the observed migration rate of the droplets. Therefore a prediction of the terrestric separation behaviour of monotectic alloys seems possible. Three publications originating from the work are part of the report. (orig.)
