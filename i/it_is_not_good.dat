Shop-floor inspection of a thread is often as simple as running a nut onto it (for male threads) or a bolt into it (for female threads). This is plenty good enough for many applications (e.g., MRO or hobbyist work), although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> enough for most commercial manufacturing.

500|$|There {{is broad}} {{agreement}} among most commentators that Smetana created a canon of Czech opera where none had previously existed, {{and that he}} developed a style of music in all his compositions that equated with the emergent Czech national spirit. A modified view is presented by the [...] music writer Michael Steen, who questions whether [...] "nationalistic music" [...] can in fact exist: [...] "We should recognise that, whereas music is infinitely expressive, on its own <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> at describing concrete, earthly objects or concepts." [...] He concludes that much is dependent upon what listeners are conditioned to hear.|$|E

500|$|To {{promote the}} album, Guzmán {{released}} three singles. Lead single [...] "Adiós" [...] {{was released on}} June 5, 2015 and features guest vocals from Farruko. The track peaked at number 26 in the Billboard Latin Pop Songs and 17 in the Latin Rhythm Airplay charts, respectively, in the United States and at 15 on the Mexican Espanol Airplay chart. According to Alex Alexdy of Hey Espectáculos, the song was not a success since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> enough to compete with other 'reggaeton' songs and [...] "it {{is far from the}} ballads that are surefire hits for Guzmán." [...] The music video for the second single, [...] "Qué Ironía", was filmed on Iceland and released on September 12, 2015. To further promote the album, the track [...] "Esta Noche" [...] was used as the main theme of the Mexican TV show Parodiando: Noches de Traje, and was later released as the third single on May 27, 2016, with a music video filmed on Campeche, Mexico.|$|E

500|$|... "Shame" [...] {{received}} generally favourable {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics. Nissim gave the song {{three out of}} five stars and wrote that although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> as Take That's previous singles, [...] "Patience", [...] "Back for Good" [...] and [...] "Pray", [...] "it sounds awfully sweet and, more importantly, absolutely genuine." [...] Sean Egan of BBC Music stated that the single, [...] "is {{as good as it}} sounds on paper, Barlow's sumptuous melodic skills allied to a lyrical prowess we never suspected Williams had in the Take That days as the two engage in a sweetly regretful dialogue with each other about their past feuds." [...] A reviewer for CBBC described it as a [...] "really sweet" [...] and [...] "meaningful" [...] song that has [...] "cheeky" [...] sense of humour and words that can make the listener happy. USA Todays Jerry Shriver noted that [...] "Shame" [...] confirms Williams as a [...] "former boy wonder" [...] who [...] "is in no danger of losing his mojo". Katie Boucher of The National called the single [...] "a bouncy reconciliatory duet" [...] with a sound more similar to Take That, rather than Williams's solo material.|$|E
500|$|One {{reason to}} study {{reversible}} universal models of computation {{such as the}} billiard-ball model is that they could theoretically lead to actual computer systems that consume very low quantities of energy. According to Landauer's principle, irreversible computational steps require a certain minimal amount of energy per step, but reversible steps can be performed with an amount of energy per step that is arbitrarily close to zero. However, in order to perform computation using less energy than Landauer's bound, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> enough for a cellular automaton to have a transition function that is globally reversible: what is required is that the local computation of the transition function also {{be done in a}} reversible way. For instance, reversible block cellular automata are always locally reversible: the behavior of each individual block involves the application of an invertible function with finitely many inputs and outputs. [...] were the first to ask whether every reversible cellular automaton has a locally reversible update rule. [...] showed that for one- and two-dimensional automata the answer is positive, and [...] showed that any reversible cellular automaton could be simulated by a (possibly different) locally reversible cellular automaton. However, the question of whether every reversible transition function is locally reversible remains open for dimensions higher than two.|$|E

2500|$|Similarly, [...] prohibits showing {{partiality}} in judicial proceedings. Earlier, in [...] God told Moses to {{tell the}} people, more narrowly, not to favor a poor person in a dispute. More broadly, in [...] Moses told that God shows no partiality among persons. Among the prophets, in [...] the prophet quoted God {{as saying that the}} people had not kept God's ways when they showed partiality in the law, and in the writings, Psalm [...] asks, [...] "How long will you judge unjustly, and show favor to the wicked?" [...] counsels that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> to show partiality to the wicked, so as to turn aside the righteous in judgment. Similarly, [...] and [...] say that to show partiality is not good. [...] reports that God has no iniquity or favoritism.|$|E
2500|$|This {{difference}} is intimately tied with the different traditions on original sin. Much Protestant theology {{holds that the}} original [...] nature of humanity was an innate tendency to good; the special relationship Adam and Eve enjoyed with God was due not to some supernatural gift, but to their own natures. Hence, in some Protestant traditions, the Fall was not {{the destruction of a}} supernatural gift, leaving humanity's nature to work unimpeded, but rather the corruption of that nature itself. Since the present nature of humans is corrupted from their original nature, it follows that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>good,</b> but rather evil (although some good may still remain). Thus, in some Protestant traditions, concupiscence is evil in itself. The Thirty-nine articles of the Church of England state that [...] "the Apostle doth confess, that concupiscence and lust hath of itself the nature of sin".|$|E

He argues by taking out loans from a bank, one can leverage real estate investing to higher returns. Trump and Kiyosaki recommend more of their books and educational presentations in the book. The book describes a business mindset by introducing the reader to the terms other people's time (OPT) and other people's money (OPM).

2500|$|Newman's celibacy, {{which he}} embraced {{at the age}} of 15, also contributed to {{negative}} representations of his character, laying him open to what he called [...] "slurs". To exponents of Muscular Christianity such as Charles Kingsley, celibacy was synonymous with unmanliness. Kingsley, who interpreted the Biblical story of Adam and Eve as expressing a [...] "binary law of man's being; the want of a complementum, a 'help meet', without whom <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> for him to be", feared and hated vowed sexual abstinence, considering it, in Laura Fasick's words, [...] "a distinct and separate perversion". The charge of effeminacy was aimed not just at Newman but at Tractarians and Roman Catholics in general. [...] "In all that school", wrote Kingsley in 1851, [...] "there is an element of foppery – even in dress and manner; a fastidious, maundering, die-away effeminacy, which is mistaken for purity and refinement". John Cornwell comments that [...] "the notion of Newman's effeminacy tells us more about the reaction of others to him at the time than [...] any tendency in his own nature".|$|E
2500|$|On 16 April 2009, while {{preparing}} {{to board a}} British Airways flight at London's Gatwick Airport bound for a concert appearance in Bologna, François Ravard, accompanying Faithfull, was detained and then later arrested. In a statement, British Airways said: [...] "A male customer became aggressive and abusive at check-in when he was refused travel on a flight from Gatwick to Bologna. He appeared to be intoxicated on arrival at check-in. In such circumstances, an assessment is made {{as to whether the}} passenger is fit to travel. When he was refused travel, he became physically and verbally abusive. Police were called and he was arrested. Such behaviour will not be tolerated." [...] Faithfull, however, had not been drinking and was allowed to board. The pair was flying to Italy on a leg of her world tour promoting Easy Come, Easy Go. According to her spokesperson, [...] "Marianne was at Gatwick airport but was not involved in any way in the situation that occurred and she managed to travel on to Bologna as planned. Her gig tonight there will go ahead as planned, and Francois travelled from Britain to join her yesterday. Marianne hadn't been drinking {{at the time of the}} incident and she does not drink alcohol. She is enjoying life and loving it as she is sober and clean." [...] Faithfull revealed that although Ravard was still her manager, their 15-year relationship had ended some months ago. Faithfull stated, [...] "I'm all right but I have had a bit of an adventure – my relationship broke up. I felt very betrayed and lonely. I am much, much better now, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>good</b> for your self-esteem." [...] On 3 May 2009, she was featured on CBS News Sunday Morning and interviewed by Anthony Mason in the [...] "Sunday Profile" [...] segment.
