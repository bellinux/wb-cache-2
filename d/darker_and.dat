5|$|A. r. ruficeps, the {{nominate}} subspecies, {{was described}} by Cassin in 1852. It {{is found in the}} coastal ranges of California and on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada.

5|$|John Barry was not {{available}} to score the film because of throat surgery, so the soundtrack's score was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen, who was known for scoring many action films at the time, such as Lethal Weapon and Die Hard.

5|$|The {{species is}} {{intermediate}} in size for the Akodon boliviensis species group; it {{is smaller than}} A.polopi and A.sylvanus, but larger than A.boliviensis and A.caenosus. The more distantly related A.budini and A.simulator, which occur in the same area, are larger. Akodon spegazzinii is variable in coloration, ranging from light to dark and from reddish to yellowish brown. In general, animals in wetter, lower-lying areas are <b>darker,</b> <b>and</b> those in open, dry environments are paler. There is also variation within populations, and sometimes young mice are <b>darker</b> <b>and</b> lactating females are more reddish. The formerly recognized species Akodon tucumanensis corresponds to the dark, low-altitude populations, while A.leucolimnaeus and A.alterus represent more reddish, high-altitude animals.|$|E
5|$|While the jaguar {{closely resembles}} the leopard, it is {{sturdier}} and heavier, {{and the two}} animals can be distinguished by their rosettes: the rosettes on a jaguar's coat are larger, fewer in number, usually <b>darker,</b> <b>and</b> have thicker lines and small spots in the middle that the leopard lacks. Jaguars also have rounder heads and shorter, stockier limbs compared to leopards.|$|E
5|$|Budgetary reasons caused Licence to Kill to be {{the first}} Bond film shot {{completely}} outside the United Kingdom, with locations in both Florida and Mexico. The film earned over $156 million worldwide, and enjoyed a generally positive critical reception, with ample praise for the stunts, but attracted some criticism of Dalton's dark and violent interpretation of Bond {{and the fact that the}} film was significantly <b>darker</b> <b>and</b> more violent than its predecessors.|$|E

5|$|Five males {{collected}} from an M. vindex nest are {{presumed to be}} M. inquilina, but {{the similarities between the}} two species cannot confirm if the males are M. inquilina. While the males collected are morphologically similar to M. vindex males, the head and gaster are <b>darker,</b> <b>and</b> two specimens show a reddish-brown colour {{at the base of the}} first gastric segment, a characteristic that does not occur in M. vindex males. The genitalia is similar, but a more detailed study can distinguish these features among the two ants.|$|E
5|$|Generally duller and paler, {{the female}} {{has a more}} uniform and paler blue face, with highly {{contrasting}} cream bare skin around the eye. It lacks the red shoulder band, and the blue shoulder markings are <b>darker</b> <b>and</b> less distinct. The throat and chest are pale green and the belly is yellow. The upper mandible is paler brown-grey with a darker tip, and has been recorded as black while nesting. The lower mandible is pale grey to almost white. When flying, the female has a broad white bar visible on the underwing.|$|E
5|$|M. nigriceps {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to M. vindex, but several morphological characters distinguish these two species from each other. For example, M. nigriceps is generally larger than M. vindex, and its head is either black or dark brown; the head is broader and more rectangular in workers. The thorax and pedicel are noticeably <b>darker</b> <b>and</b> brownish red. The nests and behaviour, however, of both ants are similar to each other.|$|E

5|$|Members of the Akodon boliviensis group, {{including}} A.caenosus, {{are generally}} similar {{and difficult to}} separate, but they differ in relative cranial measurements and some other characters. A.spegazzinii is larger than A.caenosus; A.sylvanus is <b>darker</b> <b>and</b> has less contrast between the upper- and underparts and less well-developed eye-rings; A.polopi has a squared interorbital region and more well-developed ridges on its skull; and A.boliviensis is paler and has more densely furred ears.|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook halmaturina {{is found}} on Kangaroo Island. It was {{described}} by Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews in 1912 {{on the basis of}} <b>darker</b> <b>and</b> more reddish plumage than other subspecies. It is sometimes included in the nominate subspecies. It has dark brown underparts with reddish-brown rather than white markings. Some individuals of subspecies boobook from the mainland do have similar coloration, but are consistently larger.|$|E
5|$|On {{mainland}} Australia, {{it could}} {{be confused with the}} barking owl or the brown hawk-owl (Ninox scutulata), a rare vagrant to the northwest, however the southern boobook is easily distinguished by its squat posture and distinctive pale border to its face mask. The Tasmanian boobook has been recorded from southern Victoria, with one record from New South Wales. It has <b>darker</b> <b>and</b> more reddish upperparts with brighter white dots, with more prominent white dots and a yellow-brown tinge to the underparts. It has pinkish grey feet and golden eyes.|$|E
