The Bronze Age ard plough was still the plough of choice, but now much larger areas were farmed, to the extent that the southern Scandinavian regions were almost deforested. Previously, herds of livestock had pasture grazed freely in large wood pastures, but were now placed in stables, probably to utilize manure more efficiently and increase agricultural production. Even though the advent of the Iron Age in Scandinavia was a time of great crisis, the new agricultural expansions, techniques and organizations proceeded apace. And though the decline of foreign trade might suggest that the period marked a transition from a rich and wealthy culture to a poor and meagre culture, the population grew and new technology was developed. The period might just reflect a change of culture and not necessarily a decline in standards of living.|$|E

I {{just returned from a}} cooperative program in Australia with Forestry and Forest Products-CSIRO, where methods were being developed to replace asbestos in fiber-cement products. In the study in Australia, a new approach is being taken by using only alternative raw materials such as <b>ground</b> <b>iron</b> blast-furnace slag (BFS) as a matrix and cellulose fibers from sisal and banana crop wastes or eucalyptus pulp by-products. The fibers were pulped using chemical and/or thermomechanical processes. The composites were prepared by a slurry vacuum de-watering method. The initial test results showed that physical and mechanical performance is acceptable for housing requirements. Long-term aging is now in progress in Melbourne, Australia, and Sao Paulo, Brazil, to evaluate durability. Further CSIRO/USP collaborative studies are planned to study BFS-based composites optimization and low-cost construction components related to walling and roofing.

30|$|There {{are a lot}} {{of types}} of {{nanoparticles}} and colloidal particles in groundwater [1]. Some of them are formed naturally, others are generated synthetically and put into the ground by humans. Not only is the reactivity of particles important, but also their migration properties are examined. For example, natural bentonite colloids are released as a consequence of bentonite disposal of radioactive wastes and could carry adsorbed radionuclides in groundwater through granite [2, 3]. Zero-valent iron nanoparticles are produced [4 – 6] and injected into the <b>ground.</b> <b>Iron</b> nanoparticles are able to migrate in groundwater through contaminated areas and remediate the polluted soils and water [7]. In the first case, the migration possibility is unwelcome. In the second case, the better the migration, the more effective of the remediation. That is why a simulation of the migration of nanoparticles might be desirable. To simulate the migration of nanoparticles, the coefficient of transport retardation of the nanoparticles is needed. The coefficient represents the possible reduction in the rate of nanoparticle migration compared with nanoparticles with similar properties. The number of nanoparticles with similar properties changes over time due to aggregation and it influences the results of the migration experiments. A dynamic model of aggregation has {{to be included in the}} simulation programme of nanoparticle transport in flowing water. That is why mass transport coefficients are needed. The coefficients represent the frequency of nanoparticle collisions [8, 9].|$|E
40|$|Abstract The sites {{contaminated}} with recalcitrant organic compounds, such as {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs), are colossal environmental problems. The PAHs are a group of compounds rearing with multiple benzene rings, which are relatively ubiquitous as well as hardly be degraded by microorganics found in the heavier fractions of petroleum, have been proven to be carcinogenic by some researchers. There are 16 of PAHs listed in the US EPA priority pollutants due to their toxic and mutagenic nature. Thus, the innovative remediation technologies to remove PAHs of the contaminated sites have to be uncovered very urgently. The aims {{of this study are}} compared with three kinds of chemical disposal method：（ 1 ）Fenton reaction (hydrogen peroxide＋ferrous), and（ 2 ）Nano scale Zero-Valent Iron and （ 3 ）Fenton-like reaction(Nano scale Zero-Valent Iron＋hydrogen peroxide). Fragment pyrene in the spiked soil was prepared. The experimental condition were determined such as reaction time, hydrogen peroxide and ferrous concentration, preparation method of nano scale Zero-Valent iron prepare method (synthesize and mechanical <b>ground),</b> <b>iron</b> particle size and dosage. The experimental results demonstrated that Fenton''s reactions efficiently decomposed the target compound. The optimum experimental conditions resulted in 85 % removal efficiency of pyrene while operational conditions were concentrations of ferrous and hydrogen peroxide of 24. 7 mM and 206 mM, respectively. Ultimately, The molar ratio was deduced as pyrene : ferrous : hydrogen peroxide = 1 : 50 : 416 under the optimum conditions. Treatment cost about 0. 307 NT $/kg soil。 Nano scale synthesized iron particle size is in the range of 50 ~ 80 nm with surface area of 141 ± 3 m 2 g- 1. Nano scale mechanical <b>ground</b> <b>iron</b> particle size is in the range of 100 ~ 250 nm with surface area of 21 ± 10 m 2 g- 1. Micro scale Zero-Valent iron particle size is in the range of 45 μm with surface area of 1. 821 m 2 g- 1. The sequence for the removal efficiency of pyrene was nano scale synthesized Zero-Valent iron of 80 ％>mechanical ground nano scale Zero-Valent iron of 60 ％>micro scale Zero-Valent iron of 11 ％. The Nano scale synthesized Zero-Valent iron is fast about 60 min. and washed Zero-Valent iron by 0. 1 M HCl acid, the removal efficiency to nearly increases to 2. 5 times. Therefore, the results show that nanoscale iron particle can be recovered to reuse for the reduction of pyrene. The treatment cost is about 0. 495 NT $/kg soil。 In Fenton-like reaction, nano scale Zero-Valent iron added with hydrogen peroxide, the addition of hydrogen peroxide in reaction system increases the removal efficiency of pyrene by 20 %. Nevertheless, Nano scale Zero-Valent Iron dosage is 0. 3 g and hydrogen peroxide 206 mM, removal efficiency of Pyrene 93 ％. This indicates that Fenton-like reaction can degrade efficiently to decompose the target compound. The molar ratio was deduced as pyrene : nano scale iron : hydrogen peroxide = 1 : 9. 2 : 416 under the optimum conditions. treatment cost is about 0. 357 NT $/kg soil. In addition, nano scale iron is even smaller than the soil pores. While poured into underground water may distribute in the soil pores to move and degrade pollutant. Therefore, it is optimistically predictable and encouraged that the environmental applications for the further pilot and field contamination assessment by this technology are expectable promptly in the near future.

100 nm) ，(3) Fenton-like（奈米鐵加過氧化氫）法，處理實驗室配製模擬受PAHs中含四苯環之Pyrene污染土壤，並探討採用奈米級零價鐵結合過氧化氫與Fenton法對PAHs之整治成效，探討不同操作條件下，包括過氧化氫濃度、亞鐵離子濃度、鐵粉粒徑、鐵粉添加量、奈米級零價鐵製備方式、處理時間、零價鐵表面處理與再生試驗…等，對於處理效率之效應。 試驗結果發現，Fenton試劑起始反應非常快速，約 30 分鐘反應即完成，當H 2 O 2 為 206 mM與Fe 2 +為 24. 7 mM，目標物去除率可達 85 ％，因此可知Fenton反應可有效降解目標污染物。並且由此可求得最佳操作條件之莫爾濃度關係為Pyrene：亞鐵離子：過氧化氫為 1 ： 50 ： 416 ，操作費用約 0. 307 NT $/ kg soil。 奈米級零價鐵法，試驗中化學合成法之奈米鐵粒徑範圍 50 ~ 80 nm，表面積為 141 ± 3 m 2 g- 1 ，機械研磨法粒徑範圍為 100 ~ 250 nm，表面積為 21 ± 10 m 2 g- 1 。微米級零價鐵粒徑約 45 μm，表面積為 1. 821 m 2 g- 1 （此分析結果皆經由酸洗前處理）。去除Pyrene效率以化學合成奈米級零價鐵 80 ％>機械研磨奈米級鐵 60 ％>微米級鐵 11 ％。此外，奈米級零價鐵起始反應非常快速約 60 分鐘反應即完成，而奈米級零價鐵表面經由酸洗後，去除效率約增加 2. 5 倍，此試驗結果可做為傳統微米級零價鐵之再生與去除表面氧化物之參考，當奈米級零價鐵去除Pyrene達 80 ％，操作費用約 0. 495 NT $/ kg soil。 Fenton-like效應，試驗結果可以發現，奈米級鐵加入過氧化氫，起始反應非常快速約 30 分鐘反應即完成，去除Pyrene效率約比未加入過氧化氫增加 20 %，當奈米級鐵劑量為 0. 3 g，H 2 O 2 為 206 mM ，Pyrene去除效率約達 93 %以上，因此可知Fenton-like反應可有效降解目標污染物。並且由此可求得最佳操作條件之莫爾濃度關係為Pyrene：亞鐵離子：過氧化氫為 1 ： 9. 2 ： 416 ，操作費用約 0. 357 NT $/ kg soil。此外，本試驗中奈米零價鐵由於粒徑比土壤孔隙還小，所以可利用此特性注入受污染之土壤中，隨著地下水流佈於土壤孔隙中移動，或添加注入過氧化氫於土壤中有助於奈米級零價鐵之移動，並且更有助於反應，以達到加成之去除污染物效率，此項結果有作為現地污染物整治之應用參考。 關鍵字：多環芳香烴化合物，芘，微米級零價鐵，化學合成奈米級零價鐵，機械研磨奈米級零價鐵，Fenton反應，Fenton-like反應，土壤污染整治目錄 摘要……… [...] I 目錄……… [...] i 表目錄……… [...] vi 圖目錄……… [...] vii 第一章 前言……… [...] 1 -

To achieve this objective, the iron mill scale needs to be refined. This involve the work of {{grinding}} the iron mill scale to an effective particle size, which is 300 µm. Latter, the <b>grounded</b> <b>iron</b> mill scale will undergo the magnetic separation process. The purpose of this process is to remove any non-magnetic material. Than the following process is to fully oxidize and reduce the iron mill scale to form pure iron powder. From this step an optimum value for maximum heating temperature, heating rate and heating cycle was determined. Than in order to determine whether the oxidation and the reduction process have completely achieved their objective, the iron oxide and the iron powder that have been produced from both process, was characterized using X-Ray Diffraction Analysis (XRD) and X-Ray Florescent Analysis (XRF) technique.

40|$|The Line Islands are calcium {{carbonate}} coral reef platforms located in iron-poor {{regions of the}} central Pacific. Natural terrestrial run-off of iron is non-existent and aerial deposition is extremely low. However, a number of ship groundings have occurred on these atolls. The reefs surrounding the shipwreck debris are characterized by high benthic cover of turf algae, macroalgae, cyanobacterial mats and corallimorphs, as well as particulate-laden, cloudy water. These sites also have very low coral and crustose coralline algal cover and are call black reefs because of the dark-colored benthic community and reduced clarity of the overlying water column. Here we {{use a combination of}} benthic surveys, chemistry, metagenomics and microcosms to investigate if and how shipwrecks initiate and maintain black reefs. Comparative surveys show that the live coral cover was reduced from 40 to 60 % to 0. 75 km). The phase shift occurs rapidly; the Kingman black reef formed within 3 years of the ship <b>grounding.</b> <b>Iron</b> concentrations in algae tissue from the Millennium black reef site were six times higher than in algae collected from reference sites. Metagenomic sequencing of the Millennium Atoll black reef-associated microbial community was enriched in iron-associated virulence genes and known pathogens. Microcosm experiments showed that corals were killed by black reef rubble through microbial activity. Together these results demonstrate that shipwrecks and their associated iron pose significant threats to coral reefs in iron-limited regions...|$|R
30|$|The {{investigation}} of the two cross-sections under the microscope {{and the study of}} pigment composition by using the SEM-EDX revealed that the four layers of the first cross-section (bright) are also present on the lower part of second cross-section (dark). The build-up is identical as well: the lowest layer is a basic white gypsum layer containing calcium. On top of this layer, a thin brown layer consisting of a mixture of thinly <b>ground</b> gypsum and <b>iron</b> earth pigments was applied. This layer was then covered with an orange layer of lead red, after which another mixture of <b>ground</b> gypsum and <b>iron</b> earth pigments was applied. This time, however, this mixture also contained copper filings or scrapings. In the darker sample, even more (but similar) layers were applied, but the basic structure described above is present in both samples.|$|R
