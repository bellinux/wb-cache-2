25|$|These {{fish are}} {{relatively}} slender, spiny Loricariids that lack an adipose fin. The caudal fin possesses long filamentous lobes {{on the upper}} and lower margins and is forked. The pectoral fin spines are extremely long. The entire dorsal surface of the head is covered in stout, sharp odontodes. The odontodes form a sharp keel on the lateral plates and, in juveniles, there are few to no odontodes on the plates above and below the keel rows. The cheek odontodes are fairly thin, but numerous. Males may <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> longer cheek odontodes and greatly elongated odontodes on the pectoral fin spine.|$|E
25|$|Aftershocks are {{dangerous}} {{because they are}} usually unpredictable, can be of a large magnitude, and can collapse buildings that are damaged from the main shock. Bigger earthquakes <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> larger aftershocks and the sequences can last for years or even longer especially when a large event occurs in a seismically quiet area; see, for example, the New Madrid Seismic Zone, where events still follow Omori's law from the main shocks of 1811–1812. An aftershock sequence is deemed to have ended when the rate of seismicity drops back to a background level; i.e., no further decay {{in the number of}} events with time can be detected.|$|E

As a dromaeosaur, Dromaeosauroides would have had a large sickle claw on its highly mobile second toe, like its relatives Dromaeosaurus, Velociraptor and Deinonychus. This group is closely related to birds, and the NaturBornholm interpretive centre houses a roughly life-sized sculpture of Dromaeosauroides covered in feathers. Later Chinese finds of well-preserved feathered dromaeosaurs indicate that the sculpture should <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> longer feathers to be accurate. Although some smaller dromaeosaurs may have been able to fly, flight was unlikely for an animal the size of Dromaeosauroides.|$|E

Middle class individuals, who were more open towards [...] "nonconformity" [...] and emphasized individual self-direction as well as critical thinking, were also less stringent in their application of gender roles. Working class individuals, on the other hand, emphasized gender roles. While working-class people <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more assimilated to middle class culture regarding their view and application of gender roles, differences remain. Professional class {{people are more likely}} to have an egalitarian distribution of work in their household with both spouses being equals in heterosexual marriages. According to Dennis Gilbert, [...] "College life, generally a prologue to upper-middle class careers, delays marriage and encourages informal, relatively egalitarian association between men and women." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{show was}} jointly {{produced}} between Games Animation and Joe Murray Productions. Since Nickelodeon {{did not have}} an animation studio, it had to contract out to other studios. After incidents with The Ren & Stimpy Show creator John Kricfalusi, Nickelodeon began not to trust its creators as much and began to form its own studio, Games Animation. However, Murray recalls that they were still able to get a lot done independently. Murray has likened the independence to that of [...] "Termite Terrace" [...] (Warner Bros. Cartoons) from the 1930s. As Nickelodeon began to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more success with its animation cartoons, [...] Murray said the [...] "Termite Terrace" [...] mentality was not working as much. Producer Mary Harrington made the move from New York City to Los Angeles to set up Games Animation, in order to produce Rocko's Modern Life. The crew first began production on the show in January 1993. Rocko's Modern Life was Nickelodeon's first in-house animated production.|$|E

[...] By 1928, Fuller was living in Greenwich Village and spending {{much of his time}} at the popular café Romany Marie's, [...] "Only two years before, on the brink of suicide, Fuller had decided to remake his life and the world. Why not begin on Minetta Street? In 1929, he was shopping around his first major design, plans for an inexpensive, modular home that others air-lift right where desired. Now, in exchange for meals, he took on the interior decoration and chairs for Marie's new location. He must have stood out in person, too, ever the talkative, handsome visionary in tie and starched collar." [...] See also: }} where he had spent an evening in conversation with Marie and Eugene O'Neill several years earlier. Fuller accepted a job decorating the interior of the café in exchange for meals, giving informal lectures several times a week, and models of the Dymaxion house were exhibited at the café. Isamu Noguchi arrived during 1929—Constantin Brâncuși, an old friend of Marie's, had directed him there—and Noguchi and Fuller were soon collaborating on several projects, including the modeling of the Dymaxion car based on recent work by Aurel Persu. It was the beginning of their lifelong friendship.|$|E

As screenwriter, he had previously collaborated on the script for Daniel Burman's El nido vacío (2008). The film was filmed in Uruguay and produced by both countries from the Río de la Plata, [...] "The crew that I chose is my 'dream team'; it's the people I dreamed to work with, beyond nationality, and ended up being a very mixed team, a mixture from Uruguay and Argentina," [...] said Hendler. He had never studied filmmaking before, he says, [...] "Many times {{we begin with the}} assumption that the problem of film is on the technical knowledge, but the technical rules are the quickest to learn and the least you use. Experience in the use of certain resources is what gives you the possible solutions or shortcuts at the time of transporting to the screen what you imagined. The more knowledge you have, the easier you reach it, but 'the truths' about cinematic technique are the easiest to solve as a director. There were things I already knew how to do, and some others I didn't, and depend on what you're looking in each movie." [...] By 2003, Hendler had started writing an ensamble story called [...] "The Day Ends at 10," [...] he dismissed the story but the characters were kept for another ensemble film, [...] "The Move", which included a character named Norberto, a role that started to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>and</b> more prominence, until the story finally became Norberto's Deadline.|$|E
