5|$|Another {{possible}} {{reason for the}} creation of an archbishopric at Lichfield relates to Offa's son, Ecgfrith of Mercia. After Hygeberht became archbishop, he consecrated Ecgfrith as king; the ceremony took place within a year of Hygeberht's elevation. It is possible that Jaenberht refused to perform the ceremony, and that Offa needed an alternative archbishop for that purpose. The ceremony itself is noteworthy for two reasons: it is the first recorded consecration of any English king, and it is unusual in that it asserted Ecgfrith's royal status while his father was still alive. Offa would have been aware that Charlemagne's sons, Pippin and Louis, had been consecrated as kings by Pope Adrian, and probably wished to emulate the impressive <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Frankish court. Other precedents did exist: Æthelred of Mercia is said to have nominated his son Coenred as king during his lifetime, and Offa may have known of Byzantine examples of royal consecration.|$|E
5|$|Shareholders in the LSWR were {{concerned}} {{at the impact}} the cemetery scheme {{would have on the}} normal operations of the railway. At a shareholders' meeting in August 1852 concerns were raised about the impact of funeral trains on normal traffic and of the secrecy in which negotiations between the LSWR and the promoters of the cemetery were conducted. The LSWR management pledged that no concessions would be made to the cemetery operators, other than promising them the use of one train each day. Charles Blomfield, Bishop of London was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes, arguing that the noise and speed of the railways was incompatible with the solemnity of the Christian burial service. Blomfield also considered it inappropriate that the families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train, and felt that it demeaned the <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased for the bodies of respectable members of the community to be carried on a train also carrying the bodies and relatives of those who had led immoral lives.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{works of}} art that exhibit traces {{of the influence of}} the Parthenon frieze belong to the media of vase painting and grave stelae where we may find some echo not just of motifs, themes, poses, but tenor, as well. Direct imitation, and indeed quotation, of the frieze begins to be pronounced around 430 BC. One example, an explicit copy, is a pelike attributed to the Wedding Painter of a youth “parking up” a horse exactly in the manner of figure W25 on the frieze. While those vase paintings that resemble the frieze cluster around 430, the vases that quote the pediments are datable nearer {{to the end of the}} century, giving further evidence of the priority of the sculptural program. More accomplished painters also found inspiration in the sculpture, namely Polygnotos I and his group, especially the Peleus Painter, the Kleophon Painter and the late work of the Achilles Painter. Later painters of talent also managed to capture the mood of eusebeia, or thoughtful piety of the procession, as, for example, on the volute krater of the Kleophon Painter of a sacrifice to Apollo, which shares the quiet <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best of High Classical sculpture.|$|E

40|$|Dutch {{elderly people}} who are weary of life are looking for {{assistance}} to end their lives. According to the organizations Nederlandse Vereniging voor een Vrijwillig Levenseinde (NVVE) and Uit Vrije Wil, <b>the</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> these elderly people is under threat. Therefore arguments based on personal dignity were constructed to justify possible assistance for elderly {{men and women in}} this situation. The main question is: “What is <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> in <b>the</b> current Dutch ‘weary of life’ debate?”. This thesis also focuses on <b>the</b> potential role <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> within <b>the</b> Dutch ‘weary <b>of</b> life’-debate. <b>The</b> different categorizations provided by Nordenfelt, Sulmasy, Schultziner and Beyleveld and Brownsword provide different uses and forms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>dignity.</b> <b>The</b> analytical framework, based on dignity as empowerment, <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> identity and inflorescent <b>dignity,</b> shows <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> in <b>the</b> arguments based on personal dignity made by the NVVE and Uit Vrije Wil.
