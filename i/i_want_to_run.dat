2500|$|Colbert {{also stated}} on the {{aforementioned}} Meet The Press episode {{that he did}} not expect to win the presidency: [...] "I don't want to be president. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for president. There's a difference," [...] he said. Colbert made no attempt to appear on the ballots in any other state primaries, and so it is unlikely that he {{would have been able to}} gather enough delegates to secure either party nomination unless he were to win other states by a write-in vote.|$|E
6000|$|She said to Kennicott {{on their}} way home, [...] "Will! <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away for a few days. Wouldn't you like to skip down to Chicago?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps {{it was her}} querulous tone, {{perhaps a}} mere boyish dislike to being tied down, or even it might be mere hurry, that made him answer impatiently, 'I can't tell--as it may happen. D'ye think <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away! Only take care of yourself.' ...|$|E
25|$|I {{shall never}} forget the {{sensation}} of freedom which I experienced after scaling that wall. The sun shone, the waves sparkled, I had freedom at last. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run.</b> Never did <b>I</b> experience such joy.|$|R
6000|$|... "He--he sort of {{degraded}} me. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> bully {{me because}} he hadn't got me. And then I felt as if <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run,</b> as if <b>I</b> was fastened and bound up. And he seemed dirty." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, I didn't {{like the}} idea of going and {{explaining}} to Dick very much, but {{it had to be done}} unless <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the risk of having Pinky Carewe in the family. So I went the next morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{come and}} talk on board the brig," [...] {{retorted}} Dain, with a quiet smile. [...] "It is good to let the man come here. Lakamba thinks he knows much. Perhaps the Sultan thinks <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away. Better let the one- eyed crocodile sun himself in your campong, Tuan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From {{being shot}} as a spy," [...] she {{answered}} quickly. [...] "There! I'm not a fool, you know. You may think I'm a fool about you but I am not about things in general. Good-bye! This is my aunt's. Don't come in. Ring me up to-morrow morning. I'll meet you anywhere. Good-bye, please! <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to run. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run.</b> I want to run," [...] Jumper {{kept saying}} to himself. Then he would say, [...] "But I mustn't. I mustn't. I mustn't." [...] And so Jumper did {{the hardest thing}} in the world,--sat still and stared danger in the face. He was sitting still to save his life.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did. When we were hustled {{on board}} the steamer, there was nobody at the gangway {{for a few moments}} and <b>I</b> felt <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away. There didn't seem to be any reason for this, but I very nearly went." ...|$|R
50|$|I {{ran over}} two tacklers before I {{realized}} what I was doing. I didn't score or save the game, but I got a tremendous feeling carrying the ball. I was thrashing around, trying <b>to</b> <b>run</b> six ways at once. I loved it. I {{knew then that}} <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> with the ball.|$|R
30|$|I’ve lost my {{life savings}} because of {{gambling}} and I {{had lots of}} plans. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> a business …. and now I’m in a situation where, I’m nearly 50 and I’m {{going to have to}} work 12 hour days just to be able to provide some sort of security (Tess).|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, you have!" [...] cried Dan, eagerly. [...] "I don't want to go, and I won't go, if I {{can help}} it; but {{every now and}} then I feel as if I must burst out somehow. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> {{straight}} ahead somewhere, to smash something, or pitch into somebody. Don't know why, but I do, and that's all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's possible," [...] said Mr. Barclay with a {{trace of}} dryness. [...] "The first thing, however, is to beach this vessel, and then you and Jake must get off in the sloop. There's a good deal to be done, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the steamer back out of sight up the inlet {{as soon as it}} can be managed." ...|$|E
6000|$|The captain nodded. [...] "It {{is kind of}} lonely, isn't it?" [...] he said; [...] "but I can't go up till I get {{the code}} signals. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> up 'Got Left' or something, just to {{brighten}} up this island home. Captain Trent hasn't been here yet, but he'll drop in before long; and it'll cheer him {{up to see a}} signal on the brig." ...|$|E
60|$|Greaser {{uttered a}} shrill cry. Dick leaped to his feet. Then I grew dizzy, and my sight blurred. I heard hoarse shouts and saw dark forms rising as if {{out of the}} earth. All was confusion. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run,</b> but could not get up. There was a wrestling, {{whirling}} mass in front of me.|$|R
500|$|Leeds midfielder Albert Johanneson {{would become}} the first black player to play in an FA Cup final. However, before walking out onto the pitch Johanneson {{suffered}} racial abuse: “When we walked out, all I could hear was a cacophony of Zulu-like noises coming from the terraces. It was dreadful, I could barely hear myself think for those screams. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> back down the tunnel." ...|$|R
5000|$|We {{felt like}} criminals. When the rescue occurs I deny that I am {{a victim of}} trafficking, I said that I was not a victim and that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> leave. <b>I</b> had just been taken from where I was and was my only source of income. At that time I had four daughters and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> and look for them and I felt guilty, I felt that I had {{committed}} a crime ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did she?" [...] exclaimed Miss Cornelia delightedly. [...] "Well, I'm real {{thankful to}} hear it. Sometimes I've {{wondered}} if she really did want me around at all--she never let me think so. You must have thawed her out more than you think, or she wouldn't have said that much itself to you. Oh, that poor, heart-broken girl! I never see Dick Moore but <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> a knife clean through him." ...|$|E
60|$|Why would <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> it {{that way}} for? Well, I'll tell you. I had a notion by that time that the {{business}} was getting so big that Mr. Evans, the managing director, {{and most of the}} board had pretty well lost track of the details and didn't understand it. There's an awful lot, you know, in the shoe business. It's not like ordinary things. It's complicated. And so I'd got an idea that I would shove them clean out of it--or most of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Hayloft," [...] {{said another}} caller, [...] "I am sorry {{not to have}} met you sooner. Our friends here {{tell me that you}} have been in New York for some months. I regret, sir, that we did not know you. This is the name of my firm, Mr. Hayloft. We are leading lawyers here, and we want the honour of {{defending}} you. We may! Thank you, sir. And now, as we have still an hour or two before the court, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> you up to my house in my motor. My wife is very anxious to have a little luncheon with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Nancy sails in four days, so I shall go down {{tomorrow}} morning. <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> {{the risk}} again {{of losing the}} boat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was daunted," [...] Kit declared. [...] "When I landed from Cayman {{and started}} for the desert with three or four sailors, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> back <b>to</b> the boats. You see, the thing was ridiculous. All my fine romantic plans had led to this. However, we'll let it go. You're staunch and you helped me out. Now, when I'm hipped and moody you let me talk. I doubt if you know what a very good sort you are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'll tell you," [...] {{answered}} the Nome. [...] "When those Oz people took my kingdom away from me--just {{because it was}} my kingdom and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> it <b>to</b> suit myself--they said I could take as many precious stones as I could carry. So I {{had a lot of}} pockets made in my clothes and loaded them all up. Jewels are fine things to have with you when you travel; you can trade them for anything." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{began the}} day badly. He {{took me out}} and lost me. It {{would be so much}} better, would he consent to the usual arrangement, and allow me to take him out. I am far the abler leader: I say it without conceit. I am older than he is, and I am less excitable. I do not stop and talk with every person I meet, and then forget where I am. I do less to {{distract}} myself: I rarely fight, I never feel <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> after cats, I take but little pleasure in frightening children. I have nothing to think about but the walk, and the getting home again. If, as I say, he would give up taking me out, and let me take him out, there would be less trouble all round. But into this I {{have never been able to}} persuade him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} thinking," [...] responded Giles, with tender deference, [...] "that {{you had better}} {{stay where you are}} for the present, if you wish not to be caught. I need not tell you that the place is yours as long as you like; and perhaps in a day or two, finding you absent, he will go away. At any rate, in two or three days I could do {{anything}} to assist--such as make inquiries, or go a great way towards Sherton-Abbas with you; for the cider season will soon be coming on, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> down to the Vale to see how the crops are, and I shall go by the Sherton road. But {{for a day or two}} I am busy here." [...] He was hoping that by the time mentioned he would be strong enough to engage himself actively on her behalf. [...] "I hope you do not feel over-much melancholy in being a prisoner?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want to make}} a last {{effort to}} propitiate you," [...] began Chase, in his quick, smooth voice. That was a {{singular}} change to Belding--the dropping instantly into an easy flow of speech. [...] "You've had losses here, and naturally you're sore. I don't blame you. But you can't see this thing from my side of the fence. Business is business. In business the best man wins. The law upheld those transactions of mine the honesty of which you questioned. As to mining and water claims, you lost on this technical point--that you had nothing to prove you had held them for five years. Five years is the time necessary in law. A dozen men might claim the source of Forlorn River, but if they had no house or papers to prove their squatters' rights any man could go in and fight them for the water. .... Now <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> that main ditch along the river, through your farm. Can't we make a deal? I'm ready to be liberal--to meet you more than halfway. I'll give you an interest in the company. I think I've influence enough up at the Capitol to have you reinstated as inspector. A little reasonableness on your part will put you right again in Forlorn River, with a chance of growing rich. There's a big future here.... My interest, Belding, has become personal. Radford is in love with your step-daughter. He wants to marry her. I'll admit now if I had foreseen this situation I wouldn't have pushed you so hard. But we can square the thing. Now let's get together not only in business, but in a family way. If my son's happiness depends upon having this girl, you may rest assured I'll do all I can to get her for him. I'll absolutely make good all your losses. Now what do you say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think so}} either, but <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the risk, Jim; besides, I am sure {{neither of us}} can be trusted to keep watch." ...|$|R
50|$|She {{was only}} six {{when she decided}} {{to become part of the}} {{entertainment}} world, and recalled being inspired by watching a circus act: I thought that a man on the wire was marvelous, in his spangles and tights. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away and marry him but I never had an opportunity. I am sure, though, that the experience first disclosed to me the entertainment world. For years I longed to be able to walk on a tight wire, too.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{have more}} wind, out there, than {{we shall have}} here," [...] the captain said; [...] "which is an advantage, for <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> away from them.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> {{down the}} rail {{of time with}} you {{as far as it}} goes ...|$|E
5000|$|A to-infinitive may be {{preceded by}} a prepositional phrase {{introduced}} by for, referring to the agent, as in It would be nice for the flowers to stand here. (This is not possible in all grammatical contexts; for example, one can say <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run,</b> but not *I want for him to run; here the required syntax is I want him to run.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Colbert {{also stated}} on the {{aforementioned}} Meet The Press episode {{that he did}} not expect to win the presidency: [...] "I don't want to be president. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for president. There's a difference," [...] he said.

5000|$|The process {{exhausted}} Chapman and he {{was still}} unsure of using it until its first screening occurred. [...] "There were a couple of stenographers, who were eating their lunch watching the screening, and they were agog," [...] Chapman stated. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run.</b> <b>I</b> was exhausted and thought it was a failure, but a chap grabbed me as I was going out the door. He'd been standing {{at the back of the}} screening room and said he was blown away by it. It was Steve McQueen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is fine! This is funny!" [...] I cried, and for {{a moment}} <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>run.</b> But the same grim, deadly feeling that had taken me with Don around the narrow shelf now rose in me {{stronger}} and fiercer. I pronounced one savage malediction upon myself for leaving my gun. I could not go for it; I would have {{to make the best of}} my error, and in the wildness born of the moment I swore if the lions would stay treed for the hounds they would stay treed for me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shan't mind {{sighting}} the islands, but <b>I</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> on some hidden reef," [...] returned Roger. [...] "The charts show a {{great number}} of reefs in this portion of the ocean." ...|$|R
