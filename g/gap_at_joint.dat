50|$|Cement {{board is}} hung with {{corrosion}} resistant screws or ring-shank nails. Cement board {{has very little}} movement under thermal stress, but the boards are usually installed with a slight <b>gap</b> <b>at</b> <b>joints</b> in shower pans, bathtubs, and each other. These joints are then filled with silicone sealant or the manufacturer's taping compounds before applying a finish. The filled joints are taped like conventional gypsum board, but with fiberglass tapes that provide additional water resistance. Combined with a water impermeable finish, cement board is a stable, durable backing board.|$|R
30|$|Thus, {{many have}} studied the {{mechanical}} performance of mortise–tenon joints; however, a <b>gap</b> <b>at</b> the <b>joints</b> is, in fact, often caused by wood shrinkage and/or loading history. It is expected that a <b>gap</b> created <b>at</b> the <b>joints</b> will result in insufficient contact between members, which will affect the mechanical performance. In spite of this, a study on such <b>gap</b> <b>at</b> the mortise–tenon <b>joints</b> and the mechanical performance has not been conducted sufficiently. This study, therefore, examines {{the influence of the}} gaps on the mechanical performance of mortise–tenon joints. First, the relationship between moment resistance M and deformation angle θ of column <b>at</b> the mortise–tenon <b>joints</b> involving a gap is theoretically derived, and the experiments are also conducted to validate the theory. Furthermore, the method of estimation derived is used to numerically analyze the influence of a gap size on the mechanical performance. The analysis results are then compared with experimental results.|$|R
50|$|A {{special case}} is heat related buckling: {{in hot weather}} the rail steel expands. This is managed by {{stressing}} continuously welded rails (they are tensioned mechanically to be stress neutral at a moderate temperature) and by providing proper expansion <b>gaps</b> <b>at</b> <b>joints</b> and ensuring that fishplates are properly lubricated. In addition, lateral restraint is provided by an adequate ballast shoulder. If any of these measures are inadequate, the track may buckle; a large lateral distortion takes place, which trains are unable to negotiate. (In nine years 2000/1 to 2008/9 there were 429 track buckle incidents in Great Britain).|$|R

30|$|The mortise–tenon joint, which connects {{columns and}} beams {{of a wooden}} building, often creates a gap in contact part of members. This gap is {{considered}} to affect mechanical performance of the mortise–tenon joint. This study derived a method of theoretical estimation with a gap as parameter for the mechanical performance of mortise–tenon joint. In addition, it experimentally validated the method of estimation and numerically analyzed {{the influence of a}} size of such gap on mechanical properties. As a result, the estimated relationship between moment resistance and deformation angle of column shows the agreement with the experimental results, demonstrating validity of the estimation method derived. Results of the numerical analysis quantify the influence {{of the size of the}} gap on mechanical properties of the joint. The numerically analysis clarified the large influence of the <b>gap</b> <b>at</b> <b>joints</b> on the mechanical properties.|$|R
5000|$|These {{and other}} flaws with the {{algorithm}} {{led to the}} development of Z-buffer techniques, which can be viewed as a development of the painters algorithm, by resolving depth conflicts on a pixel-by-pixel basis, reducing the need for a depth-based rendering order. Even in such systems, a variant of the painters algorithm is sometimes employed. As Z-buffer implementations generally rely on fixed-precision depth-buffer registers implemented in hardware, there is scope for visibility problems due to rounding error. These are overlaps or <b>gaps</b> <b>at</b> <b>joints</b> between polygons. To avoid this, some graphics engine implementations [...] "overrender", drawing the affected edges of both polygons in the order given by painters algorithm. This means that some pixels are actually drawn twice (as in the full painters algorithm) but this happens on only small parts of the image and has a negligible performance effect.|$|R
25|$|The ballast {{also serves}} as a means of drainage. Some more modern track in special areas is {{attached}} by direct fixation without ballast. Track may be prefabricated or assembled in place. By welding rails together to form lengths of continuous welded rail, additional wear and tear on rolling stock caused by the small surface <b>gap</b> <b>at</b> the <b>joints</b> between rails can be counteracted; this also makes for a quieter ride (passenger trains).|$|R
30|$|Round plots in Fig.  6 show {{results of}} {{estimation}} {{of the relationship between}} M and θ <b>at</b> the mortise–tenon <b>joints.</b> These are results from Specimen T- 1, and are obtained by Eq. (16) through Eq. (4) after expressing the relationship between compressive stress and strain perpendicular to grain by Eq. (18) with the parameters in Table  1. The plots show that the moment value is zero when the deformation angle is about 0.03  rad or lower. This is because mortise and tenon, in terms of the mechanical model proposed, do not contact each other due to a <b>gap</b> <b>at</b> the <b>joint,</b> that is, there is no resistance. When the deformation angle reaches around 0.04  rad, the moment resistance comes to occur, while the moment resistance starts growing in an exponential manner with an increase in the deformation. Round plots are between thin solid and dashed lines of the test results, showing behavior as if in line with the thick solid line. As the estimations for the other five specimens (T- 2 –T- 6) generally agree with the test results, this analysis model which takes into consideration a <b>gap</b> <b>at</b> the <b>joint</b> is considered to have good capability to estimate the relationship between M and θ.|$|R

Even though it is built from several segments, like the magnetic guide, these segments are custom made in our local workshop and were designed such that no <b>gaps</b> exist <b>at</b> the <b>joints</b> of two segments. To achieve this, the stainless steel electrode mounts are constructed with 0.5 ° tilts on their outer surface (see Fig.  5). Stop bands might nevertheless occur because of the 1 ° angles between adjacent segments, {{but they are not}} observed in the calculated transmission curves.|$|R
40|$|The {{designer}} of lattice trusses has been traditionally encouraged to avoid extra joint bending moments by ensuring 'noding' of member centre lines. This can however cause {{problems in the}} design of RHS trusses with small (economical) branch members by causing large <b>gaps</b> <b>at</b> <b>joints</b> with undesirable flexibility for slender chord walls. 100 % overlap joints overcome this problem while still maintaining economic single cut branch ends. The research programme set out first to highlight the difference in behaviour of trusses with large gap noding and completely overlapping joints. Two similar trusses - one gap, the other lap - with matched sections were tested to failure. It was concluded that the gap joint truss (branch/chord width ratio = 0. 4) was much less efficient than the corresponding 100 % overlap truss despite the large eccentricities. The collapse load of the latter was some 35 % greater, while the stiffness properties were better, and remained linear for a substantial proportion of the loading. On the other hand the gap joint truss soon became non-linear, with large overall deflections. Local connecting chord wall deflections were quite small in the lap joints while appreciable deflections occurred <b>at</b> <b>gap</b> <b>joints</b> under service loads. Elastic frame analyses were carried out for all the six test trusses (one gap and five lap). For the overlap trusses, axial forces and bending moments could be predicted fairly accurately but a non-linear analysis was required for the gap jointed truss even at fairly modest loads. The effects of ß ratio, chord slenderness and branch angle were all examined within the parameter range tested. The advantages of truss continuity moments as well as plastic redistribution of moments have been observed to reduce the occurrence of the local chord buckling mode of failure (L 7), compared with previous isolated joint tests. Results obtained from tests on isolated joints can give good agreement with those obtained from truss tests, both with respect to strength and failure mode. However, as the isolated joint testing cannot always reproduce the support conditions in a truss, the failure modes (and hence strengths) can differ. The current CIDECT design strength equations and recommendations for gap and overlap joints are largely {{based on the results of}} isolated joint testing. The suitability of the CIDECT strength equations and recommendations for designing RHS lattice trusses has been reviewed. Consequently, for the 100 % overlap joint trusses a simple design method has been presented in conjunction with practical design recommendations. The problems associated with the analysis and design of the gap joint truss are described in detail...|$|R

3000|$|This study {{theoretically}} derived {{an equation}} of relationship between moment resistance M and deformation angle θ of column at the mortise–tenon (column-beam) joint involving a gap. The equation enables {{to estimate the}} relationship between M and θ of the joint by using the relationship between compressive stress and strain perpendicular to grain of wood. Figure  2 presents how the mortise–tenon joint rotated due to an external force P applied horizontally, resulting in the deformation angle θ of column. The assumption is that the long side length (h − g) of a tenon section is shorter than the one of a mortise section h by g, leading to a <b>gap</b> <b>at</b> the mortise–tenon <b>joint</b> that exists {{on both sides with}} a size of g/ 2.

5000|$|Varus {{stress test}} at 0° and 30° - [...] Varus stress testing is {{accomplished}} while {{the patient is}} lying supine on an examination table. The physician supports the thigh {{against the side of}} the exam table and applies a varus force to the knee joint while holding the ankle or foot, first at 0°of flexion and then at 30°. As the knee is stressed, the practitioner should feel for increased <b>gapping</b> <b>at</b> the lateral <b>joint</b> space. Gapping can be graded based on the amount the joint opens under stress; grade I causes pain, but with no gap present, grade II causes some gapping, but a definite endpoint is present, and grade III causes significant gapping with no definite endpoint felt. A negative varus stress test shows no difference between either knee at 0° or 30°. Increased <b>gapping</b> <b>at</b> 0° of flexion typically reflects a serious posterolateral injury with a high probability of accompanying cruciate ligament involvement. Lower grades at 30° are more suggestive of partial tears of the FCL or mid-third lateral capsular ligament, while higher grades indicate complete tears of the FCL and damage to other posterolateral structures.|$|R

The penetration of a rigid sphere (indenter) into the elastic hardenable half-space is considered originally. The elastic crater restoring by unloading is also considered. In elastic-plastic material´s describing, Hollomon´s pawer law is used. To describe a contact of a rigid rough surface with an elastic plastic half-space, the discrete model of a rough surface is used. Microasperities are represented as a set of identical spherical segments, the height distribution of which corresponds to the bearing profile curve of the surface. To describe the bearing profile curve, incomplete beta function ratio is used.
