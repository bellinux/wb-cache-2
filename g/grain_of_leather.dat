5000|$|Leather gloves: These gloves {{are worn}} by criminals because the tactile {{properties}} of the leather allow for good grip and dexterity. These properties {{are the result of}} the grain present {{on the surface of the}} glove. The grain makes the surface of the leather unique to each glove. Over time, the pores and <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> <b>leather</b> gloves will pick up dirt and grease from surfaces that they have touched or handled. The dirt and grease can in return help to create prints on surfaces. Also, unlined gloves provide the most dexterity but can over time become saturated with the oils and sweat of the wearer's hands. This helps to increase the gripping {{properties of the}} gloves but causes the gloves to leave prints. A print that contains the glove wearer's sweat and oils will contain their DNA, which can incriminate them. Investigators are able to dust for the marks left behind from leather the same way they dust for fingerprints.|$|E

5000|$|The only type <b>of</b> <b>leather</b> {{suitable}} for carving is vegetable tanned, full grain leather. This {{is because the}} vegetable tanning process allows the leather to absorb water, {{which is used to}} soften the leather before the carving process, and the <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leather</b> is necessary to allow the leather to hold the shape after the carving process is complete. Other leathers lack these two essential qualities.While the process of cutting into the leather and pushing the edges of the cuts in is relatively modern, marking wet leather has been around since the Roman period. There are some beautiful examples <b>of</b> Roman <b>leather</b> at Vindolanda near Hadrian's wall and the book [...] "Purses in Pieces" [...] is very informative with some lovely examples <b>of</b> medieval carved <b>leather</b> work. Historically, tools for stamping leather would probably have been made out of bone, but would not have been too different from what we use today.|$|R
5000|$|Hayday {{had long}} seen {{that it was}} {{desirable}} to make printed books open freely and lie flat; his attention {{is believed to have}} been drawn to this matter by seeing Bagster's polyglot bibles, which were bound by Joseph Welsh of 10 Queen Street, Golden Square, in what was known as ‘Bagster's Renowned Binding.’ These books were made flexible, and covered with purple pin-headed sealskin with a blind tool ornament. In his own binding he sewed the books all along every sheet, and to remedy the extra thickness that would be caused by sewing with thread, used silk, and to equalise the thickness rounded the fore edges more than was customary. To make the back tight he dispensed with the ordinary backing of paper, and fastened the leather cover down to the back. Still the constant opening of the book disfigured the <b>grain</b> <b>of</b> the <b>leather,</b> and to obviate this he introduced the cross or pin-headed grain, or what is now termed Turkey Morocco.|$|R

40|$|Leather is {{a natural}} {{material}} with many applications: automotive, domestic upholstery, buildings, aviation, maritime, personal safety, etc. For each of these sectors, fire behavior is a field of particular interest. Unfortunately, there are many testing methods and different flammability standards depending on material application and end use. Therefore, there are different ways of approaching the whole flammability issue. In this work, different approaches for analyzing the fire resistance <b>of</b> <b>leather</b> are examined: (i) influence {{of the type of}} tannage, (ii) influence of the type <b>of</b> <b>leather,</b> (iii) influence <b>of</b> the type of retannage, (iv) influence of the type of fatliquor, and (v) influence of the use of flame retardants. The results indicate that leather presents natural fire resistance. However, the type <b>of</b> <b>leather,</b> type <b>of</b> tannage, retannage and fatliquor effect the flammability behavior <b>of</b> <b>leather.</b> In addition, the use of flame retardants slightly improves the smouldering properties <b>of</b> <b>leather.</b> Postprint (published version...|$|R
