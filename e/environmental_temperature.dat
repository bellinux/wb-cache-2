Fresh mushrooms consist of over 80% moisture, although reported values tend to differ somewhat as moisture content {{can be affected}} by <b>environmental</b> <b>temperature</b> and relative humidity during growth and storage, {{as well as the}} relative amount of water that may be produced as a result of normal metabolic processes during storage.|$|E

Based on the surrounding <b>environmental</b> <b>temperature</b> and density, partially ionised or fully ionised forms of plasma may be produced. Neon signs or lightning storms are examples of partially ionised plasma, while the interior of the Sun is an example of fully ionised plasma, along with the solar corona and stars.|$|E

In three varieties the tumours weighed less at lower <b>environmental</b> <b>temperatures</b> than at higher ones. At three <b>environmental</b> <b>temperatures</b> in the physiological range the surfaces were cooler than the adjacent skin, and the tissues of tumours were cooler than the surrounding subcutaneous tissues. These differences were greater in cooler than in warmer environments and increased as tumours grew larger. There were no histological changes {{to account for the}} different tumour weights at different <b>environmental</b> <b>temperatures</b> and it seems probable that tumours are unable to maintain their temperature and their metabolism in cool environments.

25|$|Metabolic rate, which {{indirectly}} affects respiration, is {{also influenced}} by <b>environmental</b> <b>temperature.</b> Peak metabolism occurs at about 32°C.

40|$|Distributions and isotopic {{analyses}} of lipids from sediment cores at a hydrothermally active {{site in the}} Guaymas Basin with a steep sedimentary temperature gradient revealed the presence of archaea that oxidize methane anaerobically. The presence of strongly 13 C-depleted lipids at greater depths in the sediments suggests that microbes involved in anaerobic oxidation of methane are present and presumably active at <b>environmental</b> <b>temperatures</b> of > 30 °C, indicating that this process can occur not only at cold seeps but also at hydrothermal sites.

25|$|Like {{many other}} reptiles, {{chameleons}} are poikilotherms meaning their body temperature is completely dependent on <b>environmental</b> <b>temperature.</b> A {{large amount of}} lizards {{are expected to be}} affected by climate change in the near future, especially in Southern Africa where this species is found. If temperatures rise by 1-3 degrees Celsius, then it is expected that Cape Dwarf Chameleon running speed will increase as well. Although speed would be better, bite and grip force would become worse. Chameleons are adapted to current habitat temperatures and conditions, but shifting to a higher temperature would actually benefit some of their traits and abilities. This shows that future persistence of this species is very likely even with the advancement of global warming.|$|E
25|$|Dr. David M. Maurice (1922-2002), an eye {{specialist}} and semi-retired adjunct professor at Columbia University, proposed that REM sleep {{was associated with}} oxygen supply to the cornea, and that aqueous humor, the liquid between cornea and iris, was stagnant if not stirred. Among the supportive evidences, he calculated that if aqueous humor was stagnant, oxygen from iris had to reach cornea by diffusion through aqueous humor, which was not sufficient. According to the theory, when the animal is awake, eye movement (or cool <b>environmental</b> <b>temperature)</b> enables the aqueous humor to circulate. When the animal is sleeping, REM provides the much-needed stir to aqueous humor. This theory {{is consistent with the}} observation that fetuses, as well as eye-sealed newborn animals, spend much time in REM sleep, and that during a normal sleep, a person's REM sleep episodes become progressively longer deeper into the night. However, owls have REM sleep, but do not move their head more than in non-REM sleep and is well known that owls' eyes are nearly immobile.|$|E
25|$|Measurements {{of small}} {{variations}} in the natural abundances of deuterium, {{along with those of}} the stable heavy oxygen isotopes 17O and 18O, are of importance in hydrology, to trace the geographic origin of Earth's waters. The heavy isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in rainwater (so-called meteoric water) are enriched {{as a function of the}} <b>environmental</b> <b>temperature</b> of the region in which the precipitation falls (and thus enrichment is related to mean latitude). The relative enrichment of the heavy isotopes in rainwater (as referenced to mean ocean water), when plotted against temperature falls predictably along a line called the global meteoric water line (GMWL). This plot allows samples of precipitation-originated water to be identified along with general information about the climate in which it originated. Evaporative and other processes in bodies of water, and also ground water processes, also differentially alter the ratios of heavy hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in fresh and salt waters, in characteristic and often regionally distinctive ways. The ratio of concentration of 2H to 1H is usually indicated with a delta as δ2H and the geographic patterns of these values are plotted in maps termed as isoscapes. Stable isotope are incorporated into plants and animals and an analysis of the ratios in a migrant bird or insect can help suggest a rough guide to their origins.|$|E
