50|$|In 1996, {{the game}} was ported to the PlayStation, Saturn, and PC. Because Atari Games had been {{purchased}} by WMS Industries in the interim, these versions were published by WMS's Midway Games subsidiary. It was re-released on the PlayStation in 2001 by Midway {{as part of their}} Midway Classics range. Tiger Electronics later released a handheld version of the <b>game</b> <b>with</b> an LCD <b>screen</b> and small light gun.|$|R
50|$|Although highly {{popular in}} the year after its release, Tehkan World Cup faded as newer <b>games</b> {{appeared}} <b>with</b> larger <b>screens</b> and better graphics. Its trackball system exhibited issues with wear under high use, and without maintenance most specimens eventually broke down.

500|$|During development, Rain World {{animations}} {{became popular}} {{on social media}} for their [...] "uncanny fluidity", which reviewers continued to praise at release. IGN described Slugcat's animations as beautiful and reactive to the angle and physics of movement, from clinging to poles to squeezing through ventilation. The reviewer said it was among the best aesthetics in a 2D <b>game,</b> <b>with</b> each <b>screen</b> showing abundant detail and meticulous craft. The graphics were more interesting than beautiful to Polygon reviewer, who also praised the limited color palette's role in distinguishing the Slugcat, prey, and enemies from the environment. While some journalists compared the game's aesthetic to that of Limbo, Rock, Paper, Shotgun reviewer felt that Rain World had {{more in common with}} [...] aesthetic: both featured similarly dark yet attractive worlds, scary yet fascinating characters, frequent inter-enemy conflict, and frustrating or masochistic controls. Oddworld, though, had more frequent saves. Rain World successfully depicted [...] "the cruel indifference of nature", according to GameSpot. Its imaginative and compelling landscapesurreal inhabitants in a bleak, alien atmosphererecalled the spirit of games like BioShock and Abzû, in which the reviewer was too attracted to the artistic detail to contemplate the credulity of the man-made environment.|$|R

40|$|We {{present some}} {{possibilities}} and our experiments with the "immaterial " walk-through FogScreen for gaming and phys-ical exercise. We use real-time 3 D graphics and interactivity for creating visually and physically compelling <b>games</b> <b>with</b> the immaterial <b>screens.</b> An immaterial projection screen has many advantages for physical exercise, games and other activities. It is visual-ly intriguing {{and can also}} be made two-sided so that the op-posing gamers on each side see both {{their side of the}} screen and each other through it, and can even walk through it. The immaterial nature of the screen helps also on maintenance, as the screen is unbreakable and stays always clean. The initial results show that the audience stayed <b>with</b> the <b>game</b> over extended periods of time. The overall comments of the gaming and physical exercise environment were positive and it was generally assessed to be captivating and inspiring.

5000|$|Most of {{the game}} is played on a <b>game</b> <b>screen</b> <b>with</b> a small {{scrolling}} top-down map in the center and a number of status displays surrounding it. After leaving port the display switches to this map, and the player guides the ship to the New World. At any point the player can bring up a menu with contents based on the player's current location. For instance, if the menu is brought up while on the ship, the items allow you to view the map, or [...] "drop stuff off", the later selection allowing exploration parties to be created by dropping off men and supplies from the ships. When the player is on land as part of an exploration party, the same menu item creates a fort when men are dropped off in it.|$|R
5000|$|The {{game has}} an Easter egg. After killing the Swirl in mid-flight, a black {{vertical}} line {{will appear on}} the screen across the spot where the Swirl was shot (the line is referred to in the manual as the [...] "Ghost of Yars" [...] and warns the player to stay off its [...] "mean streak"). If the Yar is in the lower 3rd of the screen and the black spot on its back across the vertical line at the moment the explosion vanishes, the game will end and go into the <b>Game</b> Select <b>screen</b> <b>with</b> programmer's initials, HSW, shown both forwards and backwards as HSWWSH in place of the player's score. This forwards-backwards lettering is a clue to players to look at the names in the game manual the same way.|$|R
5000|$|Air Hendrix of GamePro remarked, [...] "EA Sports {{tried to}} cram its {{marvelous}} PlayStation PGA game into a Genesis cart, {{and it just}} didn't fit." [...] In addition to the inferior graphics and slow screen redrawing, he criticized {{the absence of the}} shot-planning features seen in the PlayStation version and previous iterations on the Genesis, saying this makes it impossible to precisely calculate one's shots. He gave the SNES version a lukewarm review, saying it fails to outdo the Genesis's PGA Tour Golf III, due to the weak audio and absence of features like backspin and 3D terrain, but is superior to the Genesis version of the game and makes an overall [...] "good round of golf". He praised the detailed backgrounds and fluid movements. GamePros Scary Larry praised the Game Boy version as offering good options, graphics, sounds, and most importantly, an appealing [...] "plug-and-play" [...] style. He was less pleased <b>with</b> the <b>Game</b> Gear version, saying that the graphics and presentation enhancements serve mainly to slow the <b>game</b> down <b>with</b> heavy <b>screen</b> redraw.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the effect of the 3 C products on young children’s learning ability. In recent years, the 3 C products are very popular among young children, and there is a saying that the 3 C products have become the young children’s baby sisters. This target group of this study is K 2 children. Firstly, questionnaires on children’s usage of 3 C products at home were distributed to and replied by main children carers at home. Secondly, with the assistance from kindergarten teachers, the study used case studies and comparative research methods to compare the learning abilities of students with prolonged use of 3 C products and students with only infrequent use of 3 C products. The findings of the study were as follows: The study indicated that most of the 3 C products were not for educational purpose. Most of them were only action <b>games</b> <b>with</b> fast moving <b>screen</b> shots. The study also showed that children with prolonged use of 3 C products were relatively lack of attention and were easily distracted by other nearby objects. The study also reflected that children with prolonged use of 3 C products could not instantly follow teacher’s instructions, and their responses were relatively slow. The study also revealed that children with infrequent use of 3 C products perceive new messages slower. According to the target group’s visual inspection report, most children (who has used 3 C products) have problems of pseudo myopia and minor flash. Only limited numbers of children’s vision have not been affected. [[abstract]]The {{objective of}} this study is to investigate the effect of the 3 C products on young children’s learning ability.
