40|$|<b>International</b> <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> {{continues}} to grow exponentially, while the relevant international legal framework becomes increasingly fragmented and complex. The establishment of a widely acceptable uniform international legal framework for multimodal transport contracts {{has proven to be}} extremely difficult, in spite of the various attempts initiated by some international organizations. Owing to the increasing use of containers to consolidate cargo, multimodal transport practice has become inevitable in the field of international trade based on its numerous advantages over the traditional unimodal carriage practices. Therefore, the urgent need of an internationally legal instrument to govern liability issues arising from multimodal carriage transactions is highly requested by trading parties. This research, however, present the difficulties involve when trying to establish liability issues arising from multimodal carriage claims and the impact it has on contracting parties who are never certain on which regime their contracts are based, instead depends on already existing unimodal liability regimes to sort out their disputes. The strengths and weaknesses of the two most recent attempts at producing a uniform legal regime for multimodal transport namely: The United Nations Convention on <b>International</b> <b>Multimodal</b> <b>Transport</b> of Goods 1980 (The UN Convention of 1980) and The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea (The Rotterdam Rules) are also examined in this research as none of these attempts appears to be a tenable solution. However, {{in the absence of a}} truly accepted international uniform legal regime for multimodal transport contracts, some nations, regional and sub-regional laws and regulations on multimodal transport contracts have been initiated. Despite the recognition of the Rotterdam Rules in certain jurisdictions, it will probably fail to achieve the aim of uniformity as intended because it’s merely a “maritime-plus” Convention. With the continuous development of containerization, there is an imperative need to have a multimodal transport convention which is broad enough in scope to govern the rights and liabilities of all parties in a multimodal carriage contracts, including inland carriers and their contractors or sub-carriers (referred to as performing parties) in the new Convention...|$|E
40|$|The <b>international</b> <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> of {{hazardous}} goods and waste is a sector of remarkable economic importance. This transport activity {{is connected to}} several productive sectors and it can have considerable repercussions {{on the environment and}} health {{as well as on the}} safety of the workers and third parties that study in the same field. A certain part of the transport {{of hazardous}} goods and waste is managed by organized criminals who can obtain enormous savings by neglecting the measures necessary to protect the environment and safety. The legitimate economy is thus damaged and, above all, the efforts the International Community has made since the fifties-sixties, concerning the regulation of the complex aspects of this activity, are undermined. Two distinct judicial models exist at an international level concerning hazardous waste and goods: "transboundary movement" and "international transport". The purpose of these models is to regulate a phenomenon which, although very complex and articulated, requires a homogeneous view. The <b>international</b> <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> judicial model is here examined in 3 subsequent stages: (1) the general aspects and the details along the entire chain, starting from the loading operations, then going on to the transport itself and ending up with the unloading at its final destination; (2) the controls on the respect of international legislation on this topic; (3) a study case is conducted pertaining to the extensive PCB category which, from a judicial point of view, in certain cases can be considered hazardous goods and in other cases hazardous waste. The aim of the study is to supply decision makers with indications that can be used to improve the efficacy and the effectiveness of the regulations at a UN level and of the cascading particular agreements for the various means of transport. The <b>international</b> <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> judicial model suffers from the uncertainties that were already encountered for the transborder movement model, with particular reference to the lack of a unique interpretation of what is waste and what are goods at an international, regional and national level. This difficulty, which was already present in the first model, has negative repercussions on the second one and diminishes the efficacy and effectiveness of the interventions put into place to solve the real problems of multimodal transport which, if considered separately, would be valid. Even the controls, which are basically objectively complex and costly, come up against difficulties right from the beginning. Finally, the study case of PCBs also shows that the lack of a solution to the fundamental problem reduces the various operations inherent to transport to almost just a heavy bureaucratic practice, which suffers from practical implications that make it difficult to reach the objectives of protecting the environment and safety that the model has established. The attention of decision makers should be concentrated on two fundamental aspects. The first concerns the fundamental theme of the difference between goods and waste which, being unresolved, weakens many parts of the two models and results in the amplification of the problems on the second model. The second aspect regards the controls that should be conducted. The improvement of the technical-judicial model requires the combined study of experts, from both the judicial and technical field...|$|E

40|$|<b>Multimodal</b> {{transportation}} means <b>transporting</b> goods from a pickup point, where the operator receives the goods, {{all the way}} to the delivery location, using at least two different means of transportation, covered under the same <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> contract and by only one document, regardless of the number or type of transportation vehicles used. The key factor to the optimal operation of multimodal transportation is the <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> operator. It is up to this individual to compensate for various unpredictable circumstances, the complexity of the business processes, nature’s whims and carelessness.

Due to the above mentioned dangers and the fact that the area of liability insurance for <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> operators is still being neglected, this article raises some valid points in favour of a proposal that would cover all of the {{transportation means}} as well as all the accompanying activities with a single insurance policy. The model includes 17 elements of liability insurance for a <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> operator and all values which quantify the insurance elements in 2009 as well as the projected values for 2015, when progress is expected in the areas pertaining to the implementation of economical processes concerning transit development, as well as values for 2025, representing a period of innovation, reconstruction, optimization and modernization.

The use of {{standardised}} intermodal containers, which {{enhances the}} safety of goods in transit and reduces operating costs, has caused multimodal transport to become a global phenomenon since its introduction in the maritime environment during the previous century.

Political discord {{and the fact that the}} use of more than one mode of transport under a single contract complicates the legal situation exponentially probably lie at the root of this deficiency. Although the multimodal contract of carriage contends with some other legal impediments, the most prominent one seems to be that of ambiguity with regard to the applicable law.

40|$|<b>Multimodal</b> <b>{{transport}},</b> that {{is using}} {{two or more}} transport modes for a trip between which a transfer is necessary, seems an interesting approach to solving today's transportation problems {{with respect to the}} deteriorating accessibility of city centres, recurrent congestion, and environmental impact. Combining private transport and public transport in a truly <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> system offers opportunities to capitalise on the strengths of the various systems while avoiding their weaknesses. The requirements for such a <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> system, however, are high. Travellers have {{to be aware of the}} possibilities to change modes and the related benefit. Thus high quality travel information is crucial. Transfers between transport modes and services should be seamless, setting new standards for the design of transfer nodes and for the synchronisation of time-tabled <b>transport</b> services. <b>Multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> requires new organisational and financial arrangements between all actors involved. The most fundamental component of a <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> system, however, is the <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> network that consists of networks for private transport, public transport, and other transport services that are part of the <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> system, including of course the transfer possibilities between these networks. This thesis investigates the consequences of multimodal travelling for designing <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> networks. It describes the characteristics of multimodal travel today and assesses its future potential. The analysis focuses on the way transport networks are organised in hierarchical network structures and determines the main mechanisms leading to these hierarchical network structures. Furthermore, an analysis is made of the role in a <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> system of transport services other than private transport or public transport.

They show the potential impact of <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> especially on the capacity requirements for public transport, and they show the possible roles of the various transport services that may be part of a <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> system.

40|$|Colombia {{is not a}} Member State of the Maritime Carriage Conventions {{currently}} in force (Hague-Visby Rules and Hamburg Rules) and it is uncertain whether it will ratify the Rotterdam Rules in the upcoming future. Pursuant to the foregoing, the regulation of the contracts of carriage of goods by sea is governed by the Colombian Code of Commerce. Accordingly, the Colombian Code of Commerce provides certain provisions which particularly regulate {{the carriage of goods}} by sea under bill of lading. Amongst those provisions, Article 1644 is of paramount significance for the liability of the carrier, considering that it allows in situations where there is no declaration {{of the value of the}} goods in the bill of lading, the possibility to apply the limitation of liability agreed by the parties in the carriage contract. However, the case law in Colombia has never concerned the limitation of the carrier’s liability in the context of an international multimodal carriage contract that includes a sea leg. In that respect, Article 16 of Decision 331 of 1993 of the Andean Community sets forth that when a damage or loss to the goods carried occurs in a stage of an international multimodal carriage contract where an international convention applicable or a mandatory national law provides a higher limit of liability for the carrier that the one agreed by the parties in the carriage contract, the limit of liability sets forth either by the international conventions or mandatory national law shall prevail upon the one agreed in the contract. According to the foregoing legal framework, the aim of this master thesis is to determine whether in accordance with Article 16 of Decision 331 of 1993 of the Andean Community and Article 1644 of the Colombian Code of Commerce the limitation of liability provided either in the Hague-Visby Rules or the Hamburg Rules shall apply compulsory in the Colombian jurisdiction in a situation of localized loss or damage to the goods sustained during the sea leg of an international multimodal carriage contract, in order to adjust Colombian jurisdiction with international standards on this subject matter.

40|$|In many countries, {{including}} some developed ones, freight forwarders are neither' defined nor regulated and therefore {{suffer from a}} lack of identity in their promotional and regulatory framework. In the absence of internationally recognized definitions, the use of expressions such as "Freight Forwarders" or "international Freight Forwarders" is consequently a frequent cause of misunderstanding -and confusion. The recent use of the expression ''Multimodal Transport Operator" (MTO), introduced in the UN Convention on <b>International</b> <b>Multimodal</b> <b>Transport,</b> further increased the confusion. They are today increasingly taking a carrier's responsibility of offering door-to-door transport operations and, by doing so; they are becoming multimodal transport operators. At the time when international transport was confined to port-to-port operations, freight forwarders were considered as subordinates of shipping companies and their agents. With the advent of containerization and the growing demand for tailored transport services, freight forwarders started identifying their role as complementary to modal operators by securing certain continuity in the intermodal movement of goods across borders.

40|$|Each mode of {{transport}} has their limitation but multimodal transport which combines various transport modes is an alternative solution to breakthrough such limitation by way of synergy. To achieve such synergy, containerization and electronic commerce are, inter alia, the two indispensible factors for the rapid development of the multimodal transport. In the modern supply chain operation, containerization facilitates the interchange of goods among different transport modes whereas electronic commerce expedites the documentation flow in a more efficient and secured manners. As a result, multimodal transport has become more efficient than ever so as to create a room for lower transportation cost and shorter travelling time. Nevertheless, {{it is observed that}} the prevailing liability system of the multimodal transport, in which, not a single and uniform convention for the <b>international</b> <b>multimodal</b> <b>transport</b> has been in place, is unable {{to keep pace with the}} astonishing growth of the multimodal transport. This results in unpredictability and uncertainty as to the obligation and liability of all the parties including shippers, multimodal transport operators, carriers and insurance companies. This paper discusses the effectiveness of the Rotterdam Rules which is a maritime-plus convention in multimodal transport to which many attempts such as the Multimodal Transport Convention 1980 and the UNCTAD/ICC Rules have been taken. To evaluate such effectiveness, a comparative study has been adopted that incorporates three aspects, namely the horizontal comparison with the Hague-Visby Rules and the Hamburg Rules, the vertical comparison with the Multimodal Transport Convention 1980 and the UNCTAD/ ICC Rules and the harmonization comparison with the multimodal aspects of other unimodal conventions. Regarding the first two horizontal and vertical comparisons, they are made on the basis of five multimodal parameters including door-to-door delivery, intermodality, just-in-time delivery, containerization and electronic commerce. Furthermore, a common law case “Quantum Corp Inc and others v Plane Trucking Ltd and another” is selected for the case study on how well the Rotterdam Rules tackled the typical issues of unspecific or optional carriage contracts in the multimodal transport if they were put in the real operation. The results show that the “Outward Approach” adopted in the Rotterdam Rules is a feasible alternative different from the traditional “Inward Approach” to regulate the multimodal transport. Besides, in view of the recourse action for unlocalized damages, the use of maritime-basis liability amount is seen as the fair balance of interest and risk among the stakeholders. In the comparative and case studies, it is found that the general results are Expand, Possess, Harmonize and Apply (EPHA) in the respective areas of the comparisons and case analysis. On the whole, the Rotterdam Rules are viewed as an effective convention in multimodal transport. published_or_final_versionTransport Policy and PlanningMasterMaster of Arts in Transport Policy and Plannin...|$|E
