40|$|We {{consider}} a game between a principal, an agent, and a monitor {{in which the}} principal would like to rely on messages by the monitor to target intervention against a misbehaving agent. The difficulty is that the agent can credibly threaten to retaliate against likely whistleblowers {{in the event of}} intervention. Taking information as given, <b>intervention</b> <b>policies</b> that are more responsive to the monitor’s messages provide greater incentives for the agent to behave well. However, making intervention responsive to the monitor’s message also facilitates retaliation by corrupt agents and limits information provision. Indeed very responsive policies lead to silent corruption in which the agent dissuades any reporting. Therefore, successful <b>intervention</b> <b>policies</b> necessarily garble the information provided by the monitor. Furthermore, we show that effective <b>intervention</b> <b>policies</b> can be identified using only messaging data, and that to robustly rule out silent corruption it is necessary to experience situations where corruption is taking place and is being reported...|$|R

5000|$|In “Can Intervention Work?” Rory Stewart, a British diplomat and politician, and Gerald Knaus, a {{professor}} and author, argue that in certain circumstances limited, but resourced interventions for a humanitarian mission can succeed. The authors co-wrote an introduction {{at a moment when}} the international communality was debating whether and how to intervene in Libya, and highlight the West’s history of imperfect interventions. They quote Anthony Lake’s policy, “to help other nation’s build themselves” as a guiding principal in foreign intervention. The authors are critical of the RAND Corporation report Beginner’s Guide to Nation-Building and argue every intervention situation is different based on the local political economy and there is not one universal approach that always works. The rest of the book is divided into two sections: first, Stewart reviews the international experience in Afghanistan since 9/11 based on his experience and travel in the country, and second, Knaus provides a case study on the international intervention in Bosnia. Overall, the authors warn against “over-interventions” such as Iraq that were based on “exaggerated fears" [...] and “irrational confidence” and often ignored “local tradition, identity, and history.” Stewart and Knaus advocate an <b>intervention</b> <b>policy</b> based on ““principled incrementalism” that invest time and resources in understanding local context and defining concrete goals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: South Africa {{finds itself}} at a {{development}} cross road: optimism for "high road " development is bisected by a wasteland {{of poverty and}} overpopulation. <b>Intervention</b> <b>policies</b> are largely "faith-based", {{even in the face}} of rising uncertainties surrounding population growth, HIV/Aids and resource availability. Added to this are the complexities of disparate spatial development and social scenarios, mass urbanization and immigration. In order to confront these threats, decision makers need analytical tools that can be used to explore potential <b>intervention</b> <b>policies</b> for their efficacy, desirability and inadvertent consequences in non-target sectors. Such tools should adequately address uneven spatial development across environmental, economic and social sectors over intermediate time scales. In this study, an object-oriented modelling approach was used to allow the analysis of magisterial districts [local government regimes] individually, without compromising functional interdependence between districts. Since development trends could not be modelled for individual districts due to a lack of adequate data, a trans-disciplinary dynamic system model of national development was constructed, and the equations derived for this model (LORAX 1. 0) were down scaled to represent development at a district level. Agentised modelling was introduced: 1) to facilitate synchronous communication and resource exchanges between districts during analysis, and 2) to implement hypothetical <b>intervention</b> <b>policies</b> [abstracted from likely government actions], in districts where they ar...|$|R
40|$|From the 2003 severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) epidemic, to the 2009 swine-origin influenza A (H 1 N 1) pandemic, to {{the projected}} highly pathogenic avian influenza A event, emerging infectious diseases highlight {{the importance of}} computational epidemiology to assess potential <b>intervention</b> <b>policies.</b> Hence, an important and timely research goal is a general-purpose and extendable simulation model that integrates two major epidemiological factors—age group and population movement—and substantial amounts of demographic, geographic, and epidemiologic data. In this paper, we describe a model that we have named FLUed for Four-layer Universal Epidemic Dynamics that integrates complex daily commuting network data into multiple age-structured compartmental models. FLUed has four contact structures for simulating the epidemic dynamics of emerging infectious diseases, assessing the potential efficacies of various <b>intervention</b> <b>policies,</b> and identifying the potential impacts of spatial-temporal epidemic trends on specific populations. We used data from the seasonal influenza A and 2009 swine-origin influenza A (H 1 N 1) epidemics to validate model reliability and suitability and to assess the potential impacts of <b>intervention</b> <b>policies</b> and variation in initial outbreak areas for novel/seasonal influenza A in Taiwan.

40|$|Foreign {{exchange}} intervention operations are a controversial policy option for central banks. In one view, <b>intervention</b> <b>policy</b> {{is not only}} ineffective in influencing the level or volatility of exchange rates, but the policy is also dangerous, because it can interfere with a central bank’s monetary policy objectives. Another view is that intervention is an additional policy tool that central banks can use to influence exchange rates in some market conditions, including “calming disorderly markets ” in times of foreign exchange market upheaval. One’s view on the appropriateness of foreign exchange <b>intervention</b> <b>policy,</b> unsurprisingly, depends importantly on one’s view of the efficiency of foreign exchange markets.

40|$|Understanding the {{dynamics}} of disease spread is of crucial importance, in contexts such as estimating load on medical services to risk assessment and <b>intervention</b> <b>policies</b> against large-scale epidemic outbreaks. However, {{most of the information}} is available after the spread itself, and preemptive assessment is far from trivial. Here, we investigate the use of agent-based simulations to model such outbreaks in a stylised urban environment. For most diseases, infection of a new individual may occur from casual contact in crowds as well as from repeated interactions with social partners such as work colleagues or family members. Our model therefore accounts for these two phenomena. Presented in this paper is the initial framework for such a model, detailing implementation of geographical features and generation of social structures.

As an application, the model is empirically evaluated using exchange rate and intervention observations following the 1987 Louvre accord. In these estimates, the probability of intervention never exceeds more than about. 5 while the range of observed exchange rates remain far away from the implicit bands where the probability of intervention is one. ...|$|E
