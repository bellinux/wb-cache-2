40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} study is presented {{of the changes}} in residence time distribution in a granular bed during the course of <b>deep-bed</b> <b>filtration,</b> The results are described in terms of the distribution moments, and show that small amounts of deposit yield large changes in the second moment, with the first moment remaining practically unchanged, Higher moments were calculated, but could not be used because of the large experimental error. Evaluations on the basis of classical models of transport of solutes in porous media attribute these results to the hydrodynamic dispersion changes due to the accumulation of deposits. Interesting results were also obtained by varying the surface conditions of the filter. By turning the wettable glass beads into non-wettable beads the filtration efficiency was significantly enhanced...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{two-dimensional}} {{mathematical model}} of the initial stage of depth filtration is developed. This model describes the fluid flow and the particle transport and capture in a representative elementary volume of the filter. A typical simulation can be outlined as follows: as a first stage, the flow field is computed in the whole complex void space of the filter using a lattice-Boltzmann method. As a second stage, the trajectory analysis is derived by applying Newton's second law to suspended particles in the flowing fluid. The capture or the reentrainment of the particles encountering the filter surface is determined from a force balance {{that takes into account}} the drag force and the solid friction force. This approach, which provides both microscopic data such as the initial capture probability density and macroscopic data such as the filter coefficient, is validated on a model experiment of <b>deep-bed</b> <b>filtration...</b>|$|E
40|$|Prior to {{full-scale}} {{implementation of}} process modifications at the Brantford WTP, a pilot-scale treatability {{study was conducted}} to investigate intermediate ozonation/AOP and to determine the most suitable granular media (anthracite, GAC, and Filtralite®) for <b>deep-bed</b> biological <b>filtration.</b> The primary objectives of this research were to provide insight into the destruction of natural and synthetic organics and assess ozonated and halogenated DBP formation. Ozone alone was unable to achieve the 1 -log removal target for geosmin or MCPA, unless disinfection-level dosages were applied. No improvement was observed when adding hydrogen peroxide. A major obstacle to the implementation of ozonation in bromide-laden source waters is the formation of bromate. There is a direct correlation between ozone dose and bromate formation and by applying ozone dosages at disinfection levels, bromate is likely to exceed regulatory limits. However, adding hydrogen peroxide reduced the amount of bromate formed, and in most cases levels fell below regulatory limits. A linear correlation was established between bromate inhibition and increasing H 2 O 2 /O 3 ratio at constant ozone dose. Amongst the three filtration media investigated, only GAC achieved 1 -log removal for geosmin and MCPA. The superiority of GAC over anthracite and Filtralite® was attributed to its adsorption affinity. Filtralite® and anthracite media were both ineffective for MCPA removal due to its non-biodegradable nature under conventional water treatment conditions. At a 1 mg/L-ozone dose, GAC and Filtralite® filters achieved a 1 -log geosmin removal. In contrast, a 1. 44 mg/L ozone dose was required to meet this target with anthracite. The tandem of ozone followed by biological filtration was very effective for the control of distribution system TTHM production regardless of filter media, with levels well below current and anticipated provincial regulatory limits. The combination of intermediate ozonation followed by <b>deep-bed</b> biological <b>filtration</b> is well suited for treating Grand River water. Scale-up considerations include pairing the proper filter media {{to the size of the}} ozone generator. The best two treatment scenarios were: Option 1 : select GAC media and size the ozone generator to produce a 1 mg/L dose. Option 2 : select anthracite media and size the ozone generator to deliver a 2 mg/L dose. 4 month...|$|R
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{filtration}} efficiency of uncoated, commercial Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) substrates of three porosities (55. 8 %, 61. 1 %, 65. 0 %) for particulate sizes representative of Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) exhaust, and also refines a model suitable for predicting filtration efficiency for these non-loaded particulate traps. GDI produces lower concentrations of smaller particulates {{as compared to}} diesel combustion, which results {{in the absence of}} a soot-cake and yields changes in filtration behavior compared to diesel particulate. To produce a model that simulates the filtration efficiency of non-loaded particulate traps, an existing flow field model of DPF filtration was modified to better capture the fundamental physics of <b>deep-bed</b> <b>filtration.</b> The improved model includes additional sedimentation and thermophoretic modes of filtration and the soot-cake related filtration approximations were removed. Size-dependent particulate concentrations were measured using a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), both upstream and downstream of the filters. By comparing upstream and downstream particle number concentrations, the particle size-dependent filtration efficiency of filter samples was determined. Experimental results were compared to model predictions, and showed excellent agreement...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>deep-bed</b> <b>filtration</b> {{with respect to}} suspension formed during the preceding processes is evaluated by the test of filterability. The properties and concentration of the suspen-sion being filtered {{are affected by the}} efficiency of the preceding aggregation and separation processes. The basic principles of the test of filterability are based on the mechanistic model of fil-tration. The equations in the mathematical model of the mechanistic conception of filtration are derived from the theory of filtration.

40|$|The steady {{increase}} of human population and activity {{on earth is}} associated with a strong increase of water consumption. This is leading to localized imbalances between water availability and fresh water demand as well as decreasing fresh water qualities. The resulting water scarcity in certain regions and stricter legislations on wastewater treatment and drinking water production, require a continuous investigation and exploration of new water treatment schemes and processes. In this thesis, two specific examples of the abovementioned development are addressed by the combination of powdered activated carbon (PAC) adsorption and filtration processes. The modified Swiss Water Protection Act and Water Protection Ordinance which target the removal of micropollutants from municipal wastewater is the latest example of the increasing demands put on wastewater treatment processes by legislative changes. The process combination of PAC adsorption and filtration was investigated in two case studies in technical- and pilot scale for its suitability and performance for micropollutant removal from municipal wastewater. In one study ultrafiltration was used as filtration process to retain PAC particles from entering into the receiving water body, while <b>deep-bed</b> <b>filtration</b> was applied in the other. The combination of porous membrane filtration and PAC adsorption showed general applicability with superior permeate water quality while economic aspects remain a drawback in comparison to competing technologies. The combination of adsorption and <b>deep-bed</b> <b>filtration</b> proved to be a robust and economic process combination for the removal of micropollutants with economic advantages over membrane filtration. PAC retention over the filter bed was generally very high and considered sufficient but was shown to depend on PAC conditioning with flocculants while ultrafiltration provides complete PAC retention independent of conditioning or process parameters. Acute water scarcity in Europe was addressed in a case study, which aimed for industrial wastewater reuse through reverse osmosis (RO) desalination. In this scope, the application of the PAC/UF process was explored as potential pre-treatment step for reverse osmosis and compared to other conventional pre-treatment options. The process combination proved superior to other conventional pre-treatment technologies with respect to removal of fouling causing substances upstream the RO. Drawbacks of the process combination such as PAC waste handling and economic aspects, however, currently prevent its full scale application in the specific case. The investigations performed within the scope of this thesis specifically broaden the knowledge and understanding of the process combination with respect to optimal process configuration and long term operation for best process performance and further contribute towards the technical realization of the processes for other treatment tasks...|$|E
40|$|Water is a {{strategic}} material. Recycling {{is an important}} component of balancing its use. <b>Deep-bed</b> <b>filtration</b> is an inexpensive purification method and seems to be very effective in spreading water recovery. Good filter designs, such as the fibrous filter, have high separation efficiency, low resistance for the up-flowing fluid and high retention capacity. However, one of the substantial problems of this process is the biofouling of the filter. Biofouling causes clogging and greatly reduces the life of the filter. Therefore, the melt-blown technique was used for the formation of novel antibacterial fibrous filters. Such filters are made of polypropylene composites with zinc oxide and silver nanoparticles on the fiber surface. These components act as inhibitors of bacterial growth in the filter and were tested in laboratory and full scale experiments. Antibacterial/bacteriostatic tests were performed on Petri dishes with E. coli and B. subtilis. Full scale experiments were performed on natural river water, which contained abiotic particles and mutualistic bacteria. The filter performance at industrial scale conditions was measured using a particle counter, a flow cytometer and a confocal microscope. The results of the experiments indicate a significant improvement of the composite filter performance compared to the regular fibrous filter. The differences were mostly due to a reduction in the biofouling effect...|$|E
40|$|Aerosol {{filtration}} in fibrous filters {{is one of}} {{the principal}} methods of accurate removal of particulate matter from a stream of gas. The classical theory of depth filtration of aerosol particles in fibrous structures {{is based on the assumption}} of existing single fibre efficiency, which may be used to recalculate the overall efficiency of entire filter. Using “classical theory” of filtration one may introduce some errors, leading finally to a discrepancy between theory and experiment. There are several reasons for inappropriate estimation of the single fibre efficiency: i) neglecting of shortrange interactions, ii) separation of inertial and Brownian effects, ii) perfect adhesion of particles to the fibre, iv) assumption of perfect mixing of aerosol particles in the gas stream, v) assumption of negligible effect of the presence of neighbouring fibres and vi) assumption of perpendicular orientation of homogenous fibres in the filtration structure. Generally speaking, “classical theory” of filtration was used for characterization of the steady - state filtration process (filtration in a clean filter, at the beginning of the process) without deeper investigation of the influence of the nternal structure of the filter on its performance. The aim of this review is to outline and discuss the progress of <b>deep-bed</b> <b>filtration</b> modelling from the use of simple empirical correlations to advanced techniques of Computational Fluid Dynamics and Digital Fluid Dynamics...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRemediation of {{contaminated}} groundwater {{is an expensive}} and lengthy process. Permeable reactive barrier of metallic iron (Fe 0 PRB) {{is one of the}} leading technologies for groundwater remediation. One of the primary challenges for the Fe 0 PRB technology is to appropriately size the reactive barrier (length, width, Fe 0 proportion and nature of additive materials) to enable sufficient residence time for effective remediation. The size of a given Fe 0 PRB depends mostly on accurate characterization of: (i) reaction mechanisms, and (ii) site-specific hydrogeologic parameters. Accordingly, the recent revision of the fundamental mechanisms of contaminant removal in Fe 0 /H 2 O systems requires the revision of the Fe 0 PRB dimensioning strategy. Contaminants are basically removed by adsorption, co-precipitation and size exclusion in the entire Fe 0 bed and not by chemical reduction at a moving reaction front. Principle calculations and analysis of data from all fields using water filtration on Fe 0 bed demonstrated that: (i) mixing Fe 0 and inert additives is a prerequisite for sustainability, (ii) used Fe 0 amounts must represent 30 to 60 vol-% of the mixture, and (iii) Fe 0 beds are <b>deep-bed</b> <b>filtration</b> systems. The major output of this study is that thicker barriers are needed for long service life. Fe 0 filters for save drinking water production should use several filters in series to achieve the treatment goal. In all cases proper material selection is an essential issu...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{adsorption}} {{and mechanical}} entrapment {{are two major}} causes of polymer retention in porous media. Physical adsorption is considered an equilibrium process and is often modeled by assuming a Langmuir isotherm. The outcome is a steady state pressure response because the permeability reduction is also accounted for by adsorption. However, some experimental data show gradual increase of pressure with time, implying that polymer retention is a time-dependent process. We discuss simultaneous effect of sorption and mechanical entrapment on the polymer retention in porous media. An exact solution for 1 -D flow problem for the case of constant filtration coefficient and Langmuir-sorption isotherm, including explicit formulae for breakthrough concentration and pressure drop across the core is derived. The general model with a varying filtration coefficient was successfully matched with experimental data confirming the occurrence of simultaneous sorption with <b>deep-bed</b> <b>filtration</b> during polymer flow in porous media. In the absence of mechanical entrapment, the physical adsorption causes delay in the polymer front and {{does not affect the}} polymer concentration behind the front. Addition of mechanical entrapment results in slow recovery of the injected concentration at the outlet (for a varying filtration coefficient) or reaching to a steady state concentration, which is {{only a fraction of the}} injected concentration (for a constant filtration coefficient). Accurate assessment and quantification of the polymer retention requires both pressure and effluent concentration data at the outlet of the porous medium. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{aggregation}} and {{deposition of}} asphaltenic material in reservoir rock are significant {{problems in the}} oil industry and can adversely affect the producibility of a given reservoir. To obtain a fundamental understanding of this phenomenon, we have studied the deposition and aggregation of colloidal asphaltene in capillary flow by experiment and simulation. For the simulation, we have used the stochastic rotation dynamics (SRD) method, in which the solvent hydrodynamics emerge from the collisions between the solvent particles, while the Brownian motion emerges naturally from the interactions between the colloidal asphaltene particles and the solvent. We compare our simulation results with flow experiments in glass capillaries where we use extracted asphaltenes only in toluene, re-precipitated with n-Heptane and also asphaltenes precipitated from the whole oil. In the experiments, the asphaltene precipitation and deposition dynamics were monitored in a slot capillary using optical microscopy under flow conditions similar to those used in the simulation. Maintaining a constant flow rate of 5 µL/min, we found that the pressure drop across the capillary first increased slowly, followed by a sharp increase, corresponding to a complete local blockage of the capillary. Subsequently the pressure fell sharply as asphaltenes were re-entrained. This condition was confirmed by the visual observations that showed the slow build-up of asphaltenes deposit followed by the sudden erosion of a channel through the deposit at the time when the pressure suddenly decreased. We calculate the change in the dimensionless permeability as a function of time for both experiment and simulation. By matching the experimental and simulation results, we obtain information about 1) the interaction potential well depth for the particular asphaltenes used in the experiments, and 2) the flow conditions associated with the asphaltene deposition process. The data obtained will also be used as input parameters for a <b>deep-bed</b> <b>filtration</b> model...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} {{and application of}} multifunctional engineered permeable pavement, for example cementitious permeable pavement (CPP), can fulfill requirements for relatively smooth load-transmitting surfaces while serving as a more environmentally-conscious infrastructure material that functions to restore the in-situ hydrology and as a passive unit operation and process for treatment. This construction material technology reduces runoff, filters and treats infiltrating runoff pollution and reduces thermal pollution and temperature; while providing the load carrying capacity of conventional pavement. Cementitious permeable pavement (CPP) for rainfall-runoff {{has the potential to}} provide in-situ quantity and quality control. Two specific aspects of this control that {{have been the subject of}} significant interest and discussion are filtration and clogging. This study investigated filtration and clogging of CPP subject to stormwater particle loadings for a sandy-silt particle size gradation. The CPP was one component of an LID partial exfiltration reactor (PER) system that was designed as a pre-treatment and primary treatment interface for down-gradient secondary adsorptive-filtration in the PER. The CPP was installed and utilized at a source area loading site in urban Cincinnati, OH site subject to direct runoff loadings. Each CPP specimens had similar pore size distributions, with an effective porosity of greater than 20 %, and total porosity that exceeded 25 %. Results indicated total removal efficiencies exceeded 80 %, and ranged from nearly complete removal for sediment-size particles to a 50 % removal for suspended particles. Turbidity reductions were significant and effluent turbidity was generally reduced to below 10 NTU, with the reduction following a first-order exponential decline. Filtration by CPP included surficial straining and <b>deep-bed</b> <b>filtration</b> with the associated reduction of initial hydraulic conductivity for a fixed hydraulic gradient. For all loading conditions the initial hydraulic conductivity was reduced from that of clean coarse sand to fine silt. The hydraulic conductivity profiles illustrated a first-order exponential decline. Any unit operation or BMP that is effective requires regular maintenance; and CPP is no different. The high degree of effectiveness exhibited by CPP is a clear indication that the filtration capacity of CPP must be maintained. In-situ CPP cleaning methods illustrate that greater than 90 % of the initial hydraulic conductivity can be restored after CPP clogging, respectively. Results provide a quantitative assessment of filtration, clogging and hydraulic restoration of CPP loaded by rainfall-runoff. CPP particle removal efficiency illustrated a dependence on loading concentration on a mass basis, as would be expected since higher mass concentrations were generally a result of more mass towards the coarser particle fraction...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{the impact}} of {{hydrotreating}} process parameters on the deposition of fines that are present in bitumen-derived light gas oil was studied. NiMo/γAl 2 O 3 catalyst was synthesized in the laboratory to run the hydrotreating experiments in a batch system. The process parameters studied were temperature (355, 365 and 375 °C) and pressure (1200, 1300 and 1400 psig). Additionally, different loadings of the fines (1, 1. 25 and 1. 5 g) in 200 ml of light gas oil were taken to understand {{the impact of}} variation in particle loading on their deposition. The {{study was conducted in}} two phases; the first phase involved kaolin as model fines and in the second phase asphaltene coated kaolin was synthesized and used as model fines. Most of the experiments reported were designed using statistical technique, ie. central composite design and hence the results account for reproducibility. Other experiments testing the individual parameters were repeated. In all cases the error for bed deposition was ± 5 % and for sulfur conversion was ± 2 %. For kaolin suspended feed, temperature and particle loading had the most significant impact on particle deposition as individual parameters. High temperature (375 °C) led to more bed deposition and the trend was similar for particle loading in the feed. However, statistical analysis suggested that there was a combined effect of temperature and pressure on bed deposition. Bed deposition and sulfur conversion were optimized for a feed with varying particle loading (0. 8 - 1. 6 g). It was found that for a feed with high particle loading (1. 6 g) the hydrotreating temperature should be 360 °C and the pressure should be 1450 psig. When the particle loading in 200 ml of feed was reduced to 0. 8 g the optimized temperature for hydrotreating was 364 °C and the pressure was 1380 psig. In both optimizations the target bed deposition on the catalyst bed was taken close to the minimum (0. 1 g) and the sulfur conversion was taken close to the maximum (60 wt%). When asphaltene coated kaolin was taken as model fines, two different sized particles ranges (4 - 6 and 9 - 11 μm) were synthesized to study the impact of particle size on bed deposition. Maximum bed deposition and sulfur conversions were attained at 375 °C; however pressure did not show a clear impact for bed deposition. It was also found that smaller particles (4 - 6 μm) deposited more on the catalyst bed as compared to the large size particles. When asphaltene coated kaolin is used as model fines, there is a preferential deposition of the fines on the reactor assembly as opposed to kaolin where the deposition is more on the catalyst bed. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) results suggest that in case of asphaltene coated kaolin, the fines settle {{at the bottom of the}} catalyst bed causing <b>deep-bed</b> <b>filtration.</b> The optimization results show that higher pressure (1300 psig), lower temperature (365 °C) would lead to less bed deposition without affecting the sulfur conversion of the feed. Additionally, the physical and chemical properties of the spent catalyst with deposited fines were studied. Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) analysis showed that the deposition of fines on the catalyst did not affect the textural properties of the catalyst significantly. The Pore size and pore volume of the spent catalyst with and without fines did not differ; however, there was a slight reduction in the surface area and this was due to the agglomeration of fines at certain regions on the catalyst. Scanning electron microscope images of the spent catalyst showed larger agglomerates formed at higher temperature during hydrotreating as compared to small deposits at low temperature. Fourier transform infrared spectra of the spent catalyst suggested chemical interaction between the catalyst and the alumina silicates (kaolin). Thus, it could be inferred that the deposition of the fines on the catalyst is due to both physical adsorption of the fines as well as their chemical interaction with the hydrotreating catalyst. The regeneration experiment showed no improvement in the catalyst activity after the fines were removed from the catalyst surface which further supports that there was a chemical interaction between the catalyst and the fines. It was found that there is a chemical as well as physical interaction between the hydrotreating catalyst and the model fines...|$|E
