5|$|When Sleeping Beauty was {{released}} in 1959, the film was both a critical and commercial failure, discouraging the studio from adapting fairy tales into animated films for decades.

Chronologically, Aurora is the third Disney Princess. Despite having since established herself as a popular character for her beauty and fashion, Aurora's personality continues to receive negative press, particularly from feminist critics, thus earning her {{a reputation as one}} of Disney's most passive princess characters. Actress Elle Fanning portrays a live-action version of Aurora in the film Maleficent (2014), a retelling of Sleeping Beauty from the perspective of its villain.|$|E
