For this problem, we propose a Universal Coded Edge Computing (UCEC) scheme for linear functions to simultaneously minimize the load of computation at the <b>edge</b> <b>nodes,</b> and maximize the physical-layer communication efficiency towards the mobile users. In the proposed UCEC scheme, <b>edge</b> <b>nodes</b> create coded inputs of the users, from which they compute coded output results. Then, the <b>edge</b> <b>nodes</b> utilize the computed coded results to create communication messages that zero-force all the interference signals over the air at each user.

50|$|The nodes are {{interlinked}} by a ring {{of dedicated}} fibre optic links. An optical network layer utilising DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing) operates over these fibres and provides multiple high speed channels for services at the layer above. The production IP backbone operates in a fully resilient dual star configuration around the core nodes with channels defined to ensure uncontended backhaul from each <b>edge</b> <b>node</b> to both core nodes.|$|E
50|$|During 2006 the {{backbone}} was completely overhauled in readiness for the upgrade from SuperJanet 4 to SuperJanet 5. An optical network layer was introduced {{directly over the}} fibre links between node sites to provide massive scalability in bandwidth across {{the backbone}}. This network utilises Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) with 10 Gbit/s per wavelength. The equipment also {{has the ability to}} structure each wavelength into separate multiple 1 Gbit/s channels for the routers that run the production IP network as well as having the capability to provide dedicated point to point links at speeds up to 10 Gbit/s either within EMMAN or for linking to the outside world via the Janet Lightpath service. Two new core nodes were created at the Nottingham Trent University secondary datacentre and the University of Nottingham primary datacentre and the EMMAN topology re-engineered into a dual star format. Each core node has a separate connection into the Janet network and each <b>edge</b> <b>node</b> has dual connections into the core to provide a fully resilient service.|$|E
50|$|A basic {{implementation}} of the OIS concept sees an optical router that monitors IP traffic and if a flow appears with specific characteristics the router establishes an optical cut-through path between its upstream and downstream neighbours, requesting the upstream node to place all the packets belonging to the flow into the new path. The newly generated trail bypasses the IP layer of the router, as the packets transparently flow from the upstream to the downstream neighbour. Following a similar procedure the path can then be extended to more than three nodes, but this decision is always autonomously taken by each router and depends on the traffic encountered and on the resources locally available.Since an optical link however can carry several gigabits of data per second, {{it may be difficult}} to find a flow that alone can exploit the bandwidth offered by an optical trail.For this reason, aggregating more IP flows into the same dedicated path is essential for the performance of an OIS network.The aggregation introduces a trade-off between the number of IP flows that can be aggregated together and the length of the optical trail that accommodates them.In order to achieve good performance only optical flows sharing a significant amount of network hops should be aggregated into the same path.A core node implementing optical IP switching must be endowed with electrical processing and memory resources (as a standard IP router), a variable number of optical transceivers and an optical switching element (usually a MEMS based device).An <b>edge</b> <b>node</b> instead does not need an optical switching device because it could only function as source or destination of the optical flow.|$|E

In this paper, for the first time, we investigate the triangle minimiza-tion problem in a network under <b>edge</b> (<b>node)</b> attack, where the attacker aims to minimize the number of triangles in the network by removing k edges (nodes). We show that the triangle minimization problem under <b>edge</b> (<b>node)</b> attack is a submodular function maxi-mization problem, which can be solved efficiently. Specifically, we propose a degree-based <b>edge</b> (<b>node)</b> removal algorithm and a near-optimal greedy <b>edge</b> (<b>node)</b> removal algorithm for approximately solving the triangle minimization problem under <b>edge</b> (<b>node)</b> attack. In addition, we introduce two pruning strategies and an approximate marginal gain evaluation technique to further speed up the greedy <b>edge</b> (<b>node)</b> removal algorithm.

40|$|As sensor {{networks}} gain traction {{and begin}} to scale, we will be increasingly faced with challenges associated with managing large-scale time-series data. In this paper, we present a cloud-to-edge partitioned architecture called Respawn {{that is capable of}} serving large amounts of time-series data from a continuously updating datastore with access latencies low enough to support interactive real-time visualization. Respawn targets sensing systems where resource-constrained <b>edge</b> <b>node</b> devices may only have limited or intermittent network connections linking them to a cloud-backend. The cloud-backend provides aggregate storage and transparent dispatching of data queries to <b>edge</b> <b>node</b> devices. Data is downsampled as it enters the system creating a multi-resolution representation capable of lowlatency range-base queries. Lower-resolution aggregate data is automatically migrated from edge nodes to the cloud-backend both for improved consistency and caching. In order to further mask latency from users, edge nodes automatically identify and migrate blocks of data that contain statistically interesting features.

In contrast to the shaping eect of the burst assembly in the buerless <b>edge</b> <b>node,</b> in a lossless <b>edge</b> <b>node</b> the " eect of the assembly is more dominant and leads to a worse queueing performance in the transmission buer.

Through the analysis of the relevant time scale, it is found that this small time scale trac behavior dominates the queueing performance in most cases and {{the performance}} of burst transmission buer can be well estimated by a corresponding ND/D/ 1 model. In the case of the self-similar input trac with large peakness and at a high system load, the tail behavior of large queue length becomes much worse and can be estimated by a Fractional Brownian Motion (FBM) model considering the large time scale trac behavior.
