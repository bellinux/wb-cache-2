25|$|Racing Club {{has also}} always defended the amateur {{spirit of the}} game and of sports in general. The {{creation}} of the Challenge Yves du Manoir responded to this ideal in a period (late 1920s-early 1930s) where French rugby was marred by violence and creeping professionalism. Yves du Manoir symbolised the romantic side of rugby, its carefree dimension, le jeu pour le jeu (playing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> of playing).|$|E
25|$|Another curiosity is his Hidden Mickeys. Rosa is only {{interested}} in creating stories featuring the Duck family, but he often hides small Mickey Mouse heads or figures in the pictures, sometimes in a humiliating or unwanted situation. An {{example of this is}} in the story The Terror of the Transvaal where a flat Mickey can be seen under an elephant's foot. This is mostly a gag done <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> of it. Rosa has admitted to neither liking nor disliking Mickey Mouse, but being indifferent to him.|$|E
25|$|The sum {{paid out}} was {{so large that}} {{it was said that}} the crew of the ships {{involved}} roamed around Portsmouth with 'bank notes stuck in their hats, buying watches <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> of frying them, and issuing laws that any of their crew who appeared without a gold-laced hat should be cobbed, so that the unlucky man who appeared in silver could only escape by representing that the costlier articles were all bought up, but he had compelled the shopkeeper to take money for gold lace.' Each seaman involved received £182 4s 9¾d, the equivalent of ten years pay.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1998, Dan Nastasi & John Milnes {{joined forces}} with former Mucky Pup and Dog Eat Dog bandmates Dave Neabore & Sean Kilkenny to become All Boro Kings. The project was {{a throwback to the}} early days of Dog Eat Dog as it focused on the {{hardcore}} style that Dog Eat Dog had originally displayed on their first two releases. The band quickly signed with Century Media Records who released their debut album Just <b>For</b> <b>The</b> <b>Fun</b> Of It in 2002. The album was released exclusively in Europe due to the strong European fan base the members had in their other bands. The band would also appear on several compilation albums. The band played most of their shows in and around New Jersey before embarking on one European tour with Biohazard, Agnostic Front, Hatebreed, Discipline, Death Threat and Born From Pain, as part of the Eastpak Resistance Tour. In 2004, All Boro Kings quietly disbanded.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Henry's son Hal is joking, drinking, and thieving with Falstaff and his associates. He likes Falstaff {{but makes}} no pretense at being like him. He enjoys {{insulting}} his dissolute friend and makes sport of him by joining in Poins’ plot to disguise themselves and rob and terrify Falstaff and three friends of loot they have stolen in a highway robbery, purely <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> of watching Falstaff lie about it later, after which Hal returns the stolen money. Rather early in the play, in fact, Hal informs us that his riotous time will soon come to a close, and he will re-assume his rightful high place in affairs by showing himself worthy to his father and others through some (unspecified) noble exploits. Hal believes that this sudden change of manner will amount to a greater reward and acknowledgment of prince-ship, and in turn earn him respect from {{the members of the}} court.|$|E

500|$|Russian poet, {{novelist and}} {{composer}} Mikhail Kuzmin (1872–1936) {{is known to}} have patronized bathhouses.

500|$|After the Beatles' break-up, the two collaborated musically {{and formed}} Wings in 1971. They faced derision from some fans and critics, who {{questioned}} her inclusion. She {{was nervous about}} performing with Paul, who explained, [...] "she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy." [...] Paul defended her musical ability: [...] "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard... She {{took a couple of}} lessons and learned some bluesy things... she did very well and made it look easier than it was... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a Minimoog, which could only be played with one finger. It was monophonic." [...] He went on to say, [...] "We thought we were in it <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun...</b> it was just something we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves." [...] Former Wings guitarist McCullough said of collaborating with Linda, [...] "trying to get things together with a learner in the group didn't work as far as I was concerned." ...|$|E

Stylus Magazine wrote [...] "no one disappoints" [...] and despite the record being [...] "so obviously and deeply grounded in marketing, it’s still an outstandingly solid and enjoyable" [...] debut. The New York Times noted The Game's [...] "tough but straightforward rhyme style is appealing but not, usually, enthralling... This is a rapper who almost never forgets himself, who almost never loses himself in syllables just <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> of it." [...] The Village Voice criticized the rapper's lyrical skills, saying, [...] "the Game's rhymes are about six degrees from totally artless". Yahoo! Music also panned the lyrics for [...] "almost totally lacking in shock value, humour or insight", but praised the production, writing that [...] "musically, this is probably the greatest major label hip-hop album of recent years – a near faultless succession of hi-tech beats and ominously catchy hooks".|$|E

500|$|In 1949 Cardus {{set up his}} London home at the National Liberal Club, while Edith took a flat in Bickenhall Mansions, {{just off}} Baker Street. The pair lived harmoniously apart, though in {{frequent}} contact, until Edith's death. Cardus found London's musical life invigorating, with five major orchestras {{and a host of}} distinguished conductors and solo artists performing regularly. Toscanini paid his final visit to England in 1952, with two concerts at the Royal Festival Hall. Outside London, Cardus was a regular visitor to the Edinburgh Festival and to Glyndebourne, and was in Manchester for the reopening of the Free Trade Hall and the [...] "homecoming" [...] of the Hallé Orchestra in November 1951. The inaugural concert concluded with Kathleen Ferrier singing [...] "Land of Hope and Glory". Cardus had first heard Ferrier at the Edinburgh Festival in 1947; he became a devoted admirer to the extent that, eventually, questions were raised about his critical blindness to her technical weaknesses. He wrote of her singing that it was, [...] "like the woman herself... imbued with a quiet but reliant sense and a feeling <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> and goodness of life". He was devastated by her death from cancer in October 1953; the following year he edited and contributed to a memorial volume of tributes.|$|E
500|$|Aboard Thetis {{was found}} a {{quantity}} of trade cocoa {{and a series of}} boxes containing coin, including 333 boxes of 3,000 dollars each, four boxes of 2,385 dollars each, 94 boxes containing 4,000 dollars each and two golden doubloons and 90 golden half-doubloons. This totalled 1,385,292 silver dollars, with a sterling value of £311,690. On Santa Brigida were trade cocoa, sugar, indigo and cochineal worth in total about £5,000 as well as 446 boxes containing 3,000 dollars each, 59 bags and three kegs of dollars and numerous loose coins, for [...] a total value of at least 1,338,000 silver dollars or £301,350. Altogether the sterling value of the cargo was calculated as not less than £618,040 (the equivalent of £ in [...] ). The captured ships however were written off as worthless, although some additional money was made auctioning off their naval stores. In the aftermath, the sailors of the squadron were noted in the streets of Portsmouth wearing [...] "bank notes stuck in their hats, buying watches <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> of frying them, and issuing laws that any of their crew who appeared without a gold-laced hat should be cobbed, so that the unlucky man who appeared in silver could only escape by representing that the costlier articles were all bought up, but he had compelled the shopkeeper to take money for gold lace." ...|$|E

In homely terms, Bowling posits the totalitarian hypotheses of Borkenau, Orwell, Silone and Koestler: [...] "Old Hitler's something different. So's Joe Stalin.

She probably thought she would be at the ABA Grand Nationals anyway for her acceptance speech, why not race as well? Other reports have it that Elliott was lured out of retirement by the Bicycle Center bicycle shop as a [...] "spoiler" [...] to better position other Bicycle Center racers to take various titles. Whatever the reason, prior to the Fall Nationals she was seen practicing at the Roseville, California Oak Creek BMX track. She dominated the 15 & Over girls' class at the Fall Nationals on Saturday. However, she slipped her pedals in the Main and finished in seventh place—last, in this case—in the main. On Sunday, she again came in last (out of six) in the main.|$|E
2500|$|Transmitter {{hunting is}} pursued in several {{different}} popular formats. [...] Many transmitter hunts are organized by local radio clubs, and may be conducted {{in conjunction with other}} events, such as a radio enthusiast convention or club meeting. [...] Before each hunt, participants are informed of the frequency or frequencies on which the transmitters will be operating, and a set of boundaries that define a search area in which the transmitters will be located. [...] Transmitter hunters use radio direction finding techniques to determine the likely direction and distance to the hidden transmitter from several different locations, and then triangulate the probable location of the transmitter. [...] Some hunts may include limits on the amount of time allowed to find a transmitter. [...] Although many transmitter hunts are conducted just <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>fun</b> of the activity, some more competitive hunts will recognize winners in publications and offer awards, such as medals or trophies.|$|E
