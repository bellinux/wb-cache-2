40|$|A new Lightning Protection System (LPS) was {{designed}} and built at Launch Complex 39 B (LC 39 B), at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, which consists of a catenary wire system (at a height of about 181 meters above ground level) supported by three insulators installed atop three towers in a triangular configuration. A total of nine downconductors (each about 250 meters long, on average) {{are connected to the}} catenary wire system. Each of the nine downconductors is connected to a 7. 62 -meter radius circular counterpoise conductor with six equally spaced 6 -meter long vertical grounding rods. Grounding requirements at LC 39 B call for all underground and above ground metallic piping, enclosures, raceways, and cable trays, within 7. 62 meters of the counterpoise, to be bounded to the counterpoise, which results in a complex interconnected grounding system, given the many metallic piping, raceways, and cable trays that run in multiple direction around LC 39 B. The complexity of this grounding system makes the fall of potential method, which uses multiple metallic rods or stakes, unsuitable for measuring the grounding impedances of the downconductors. To calculate the downconductors grounding impedance, an <b>Earth</b> Ground <b>Clamp</b> (a stakeless grounding resistance measuring device) and a LPS Alternative Transient Program (ATP) model are used. The <b>Earth</b> Ground <b>Clamp</b> is used to measure the loop impedance plus the grounding impedance of each downconductor and the ATP model is used to calculate the loop impedance of each downconductor circuit. The grounding impedance of the downconductors is then calculated by subtracting the ATP calculated loop impedances from the <b>Earth</b> Ground <b>Clamp</b> measurements...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the workplace hazards generally faced by industrial workers, electricians are also particularly exposed to injury by electricity. An electrician may experience electric shock due to direct contact with energized circuit conductors or due to stray voltage caused by faults in a system. An electric arc exposes eyes and skin to hazardous amounts of heat and light. Faulty switchgear may cause an arc flash incident with a resultant blast. Electricians are trained to work safely and take many measures to minimize the danger of injury. Lockout and tagout procedures are used {{to make sure that}} circuits are proven to be de-energized before work is done. Limits of approach to energized equipment protect against arc flash exposure; specially designed flash-resistant clothing provides additional protection; grounding (<b>earthing)</b> <b>clamps</b> and chains are used on line conductors to provide a visible assurance that a conductor is de-energized. Personal protective equipment provides electrical insulation as well as protection from mechanical impact; gloves have insulating rubber liners, and work boots and hard hats are specially rated to provide protection from shock. If a system cannot be de-energized, insulated tools are used; even high-voltage transmission lines can be repaired while energized, when necessary.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- One of {{the main}} {{requirements}} for LPS (Lightning Protection System) earthing system is to provide its reliable long time service. The earthing system components embedded in soil: earth electrodes, <b>earth</b> conductors and <b>clamps</b> are usually exposed to much more severe environmental factors than those installed in open air area. Main phenomenon influencing their reliable performance is the corrosion affecting earthing system components. The extensive list of different requirements for design and dimensioning of earthing system elements of LPS is given in new series of IEC 62305 on lightning protection {{as well in the}} EN standards related to the specific test requirements for lightning protection system earth electrodes and conductors. Some of these requirements are characterized in the paper. In 2003 started in Poland the long-term project of field corrosion tests of earth rods. The aim of these investigations was to compare the corrosion rate of two commonly used protective coating materials of steel earth electrodes: hot-dip zinc coatings and electrodeposited copper coatings. Preliminary results of earth rods field corrosion tests after 2 and 4 years exposure in different soil types are discussed in the paper...|$|R
