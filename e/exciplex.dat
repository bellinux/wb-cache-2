Our research group have also focused on optical memory studies on dicyano complexes of Au(I) and Ag(I) [9]. Optical memory is an exciting phenomenon which is analogues to “write, read and erase” phenomena. Using a small crystal like KCl doped KAg(CN) 2, one can irradiate the crystal using a 265 nm laser at very low temperature which is analogous to “write”, then record the luminescence properties analogous to “read”, then by keeping the crystal in dark, the memory can be erased which analogous to “erase” process. Optical memory of these types of crystals can be applicable to make new optical devices. Cyanodon dactylon is being used as a supplementary medicine in Ayurvedic medical system in India to increase the red blood cells of people who suffer from anaemia [10]. We investigated different classes of compounds present in the plant using extraction methods and phytochemical screenings [11]. Further investigations need to be done to identify active compounds and the feasibility to use in human consumption. Selenium is an essential element to the human body but it plays the dual role. At low levels it is deficient but at higher levels it is toxic. Therefore, US Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine recommended dietary allowances (RDAs) for selenium [12]. But in Sri Lanka, there is no any evidence regarding selenium levels of our consumable food. Therefore, we started analyzing selenium levels of our edible food and reported selenium levels of some consumable food in Sri Lanka [13]. Arsenic is a metalloid and a natural element which can be exposed to the environment by different processes such as mining, coal burning, usage of pesticides, wood preserving arsenicals etc. In Sri Lanka, arsenic contamination is mainly due to the usage of pesticides [14]. Sri Lankan farmers use huge amounts of pesticides for different agricultural purposes. Recently, there is a myth throughout the country about arsenic contamination in rice and water bodies. The effects of arsenic depend on the chemical form and the extent of exposure [15]. Since inorganic arsenic is more toxic than organic arsenic, it is always better to check different species of arsenic present rather than determining total arsenic. Recently, a large number of patients of chronic kidney disease are reported in some parts of Sri Lanka and many scientists suspect that one cause may be the arsenic present in rice and water. Currently, we engage in this project with the collaboration of University of Canberra to find a solution by studying arsenic speciation.
