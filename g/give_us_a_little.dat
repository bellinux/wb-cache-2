6000|$|... "And we are straight, too," [...] {{burst out}} Randy, stung by the insinuation. [...] "You shall have your money, {{if only you}} will <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You and I, in fact," [...] said Trefusis, [...] "die of starvation, I suppose, {{unless we}} choose to work, or unless they <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> out-door relief in {{consideration}} of our bad bringing-up." ...|$|E
60|$|This <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more elbow-room, and {{the band}} started again.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Fipile laughed outright. [...] "You {{are honest}} enough about it, I must say. How about <b>giving</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> information? Will you object to that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wish you'd <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more room," [...] he muttered. [...] "However, {{it will be}} {{all right}} unless we get fog. We might blunder into one another then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Out with it, Morris," [...] said Mat, [...] "it isn't very long, is it?--because, if it is, we'll get Dot to <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{whiskey and}} hot water first. I'm {{sick of the}} claret." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was {{no reply}} to {{this for a}} moment, and then I was asked--"To tack, and <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> chance, by drawing him away for a few minutes. We are armed, and will come out to your assistance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{consider}} {{that it is}} a fraud upon the public, Captain Mervyn. Gentlemen's dress is so dingy and monotonous that I consider it distinctly the duty of soldiers to <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> light and colour when they get the chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I am glad {{we heard}} from Luke,” said Dave. “That <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> to work on. I hope the Emma Brown, or {{whatever}} her name may be, hasn’t sailed yet.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We have {{explained}} {{it all to}} her, Lady Lovel, {{as well as we}} could. The Serjeant yesterday evening <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> history of what occurred. It seems to have been quite a triumph." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good," [...] {{said the}} Aga of cavalry, venting {{a sigh of}} relief, which {{propelled}} a miniature gunshot half-way across the room; [...] "that enables me to decide the course which I shall pursue, and <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> breathing-time before entering on the final act of the play." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, {{suppose you}} <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> preaching; {{we have a}} leisure moment just now, and there's no telling how much good you might do a set of reprobates like us, in a few words. Here, mount this horseblock, and take your text where you please." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The devil take Hector," [...] {{said the}} Antiquary, hastening {{to the scene}} of action; [...] "his Highland blood is up again, and we shall have him {{fighting}} a duel with the bailiff. Come, Mr. Sweepclean, you must <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time--I know you would not wish to hurry Sir Arthur." ...|$|E
60|$|For an hour we {{discussed}} the situation. They were the first white men we had met on the entire journey, almost the only returning footsteps, {{and were able to}} <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> information of the trail, but only for a distance of about forty miles; beyond this they had not ventured.|$|E
60|$|On {{the fifth}} day the {{physician}} came again and <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> hope. He said the tenth day from the first appearance of the typhus would probably decide {{the result of the}} illness, and he arranged for his third visit to take place on that date. The interval passed as before--except that the Count went to London again one morning and returned at night.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am in {{love with}} you, you know. Old men can be very much in love, but they know it is no good--that makes them endurable. Still, we like to feel of use to youth and beauty; it <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> warmth. Come; tell me your grief!" [...] He waited a moment, then said irritably: [...] "Well, well, we go to music then!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{lead off}} track is “Honey, Let Me Sing You A Song,” which Hires <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> taste {{of in the}} form of an {{acoustic}} demo on his [...] "Live From The Hotel Cafe" [...] EP. This is the song that will make him a household name, and should be all over the radio and at the top of the charts in no time at all." [...] —This Is Modern ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} would <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more time," [...] said the girl. [...] "I am sure you will hear {{something}} in a few days, and you need not be afraid there will be anything more to pay unless you are satisfied that you have received the full worth of the money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “We’ll both stir him up, Leo. But I guess {{before we}} go much further we had better get a lawyer’s advice. In a few weeks the circus will make two three-day stops and that will <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time, {{certainly}} more than we get {{when we go to}} a new town every day.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is very hard,' grumbled Mrs. Morton, 'that you {{can never}} be {{contented}} to stay with your poor mother! I did hope that with the regatta, and the yachts, and Mr. Brady, you would find amusement enough to <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of your company; but nothing is good enough for you now. Which of your fine friends are you going to?' ...|$|E
5000|$|Petitot wrote [...] "While {{there were}} no more than 400 people {{gathered}} at the time {{on the south side of}} the portage they <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> understanding of the confusion of languages at the Tower of Babel. There were people from French Canada, Scotland, Orkney, England, Norway. There were Woodland Cree, Swampy Cree, Chippewa, Chipewyan, Beaver and Métis of all kinds. Grouard and I represented the French." [...] (translation).|$|R
6000|$|... "Stobell was wondering," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Chalk, [...] "whether you couldn’t <b>give</b> <b>us</b> just <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{bit more}} of a hint, without breaking your word, of course." ...|$|R
5000|$|The group's {{emergence}} at a {{time when}} teen-oriented acts like the Spice Girls and the Backstreet Boys were just hitting {{the top of the charts}} around the world compelled them to differentiate themselves from the mere [...] "boy band" [...] status that they derided. From the start, they emphasized that they wrote much of their own material, which reflected R&B influences more than mainstream pop roots. [...] "There are major differences musically between groups, not to mention the fact that we were signed to Motown, which <b>gives</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more credibility as far as R&B and soul music goes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "there is a chance. Rynders may come {{back before the}} Rackbirds {{discover}} us, and even if {{two or three of}} them find out our retreat, I may be able to dispose of them, and thus <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more time. That is our only ground of hope. Those men are bound to come here sooner or later, and everything depends upon the return of Rynders." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ada {{being in}} our room with a cold, Mr. Skimpole was left alone all this time and entertained himself by playing snatches of pathetic airs and {{sometimes}} singing to them (as we heard at a distance) with great expression and feeling. When we rejoined him in the drawing-room {{he said he would}} <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> ballad which had come into his head [...] "apropos of our young friend," [...] and he sang one about a peasant boy, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, Luke, <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> music, {{before it}} gets past hours," [...] {{suggested}} Dave, and willingly enough Luke got out a banjo, tuned up, and rendered several favorites. While the playing was going on, the door was left open, and a small crowd congregated in the hallway to listen, for Luke was really a skillful performer. All too soon the playing {{had to come to}} an end, as the time for [...] "lights out" [...] arrived.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the year}} 1779 he had {{finished}} the canal up {{to the town of}} St. columb..... in that year I went with some friends to visit this work. We overtook this poor old man groping his way up the inside of his canal, and leading <b>a</b> miserable <b>little</b> horse in his hand. We joined him and he conducted us to all the parts of his ingeneous work with the intelligence of one who had formed the whole, inch by inch, and this alone can account for the ease and safety with which in his blind state he passed though every part of it. We dined together and he <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> history of his life" ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{warming up}} in their {{traditional}} orange home jerseys, the Vols (4-4, 2/3 Southeastern Conference) seemed to take the Gamecocks by surprise as they took the field in Halloween-inspired uniforms. [...] "The guys were excited and I think it <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> extra excitement and had us ready to play," [...] Vols defensive tackle Dan Williams said. Jonathan Crompton threw two touchdowns, Hardesty ran for two more and Rico McCoy forced two fumbles. South Carolina (6-3, 3-3) fumbled on its first two drives on a rainy night, having entered the game with only five for the season. Tennessee, hampered by turnovers early in the season, did not give the ball away {{for the first time}} this season.|$|R
60|$|We {{could not}} see the town of Annapolis, {{which turned out to be}} up-stream from us, though we {{afterwards}} ascertained that we were within a mile or two of it. The fishermen walked in the direction of the town, and disappeared. All we wanted now was tolerably good weather, with a fair wind, or, at least, with less wind. The blow had driven in the fishermen, and we thought it wise to be governed by their experience. Nothing occurred in the course of the day, the weather remaining the same, and we being exposed to the rain, with no other cover than trees without leaves. There were many pines, however, and they <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> shelter.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it hasn't," [...] Saxon defended. [...] "The {{stock is}} all right. We're just as able as our folks ever were, and we're {{healthier}} {{on top of}} it. We've been brought up different, that's all. We've lived in cities all our lives. We know the city sounds and thugs, but we don't know the country ones. Our training has been unnatural, that's {{the whole thing in}} a nutshell. Now we're going in for natural training. <b>Give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time, and we'll sleep as sound out of doors as ever your father or mine did." ...|$|E
60|$|Nor {{shall we}} lead the Reader into any Mistake {{concerning}} {{this part of}} our Work, {{as if this was}} or is meant to be a particular Satyr upon the D-----ss of -----------, and upon her only, as if we had no DEVILS among us in the Phenomena of fair Ladies, but this one: If Satan would be so honest to us as he might be (and 'twou'd be very ingenuous in him, that must be acknowledg'd, to <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of his Illumination in this Case) we should soon be able to unmasque a great many notable Figures among us, to our real Surprize.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] he remarked, [...] "I {{had hoped}} that {{monsieur}} {{would have been able}} to <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> information. There are many people in the village who would like to know who this Madame de Melbain is, for it is since her coming that all has been different. The park has been closed, the peasants and farmers have received orders forbidding them to accept boarders at present, and I myself am asked--for a consideration, I admit--to receive no further guests. Naturally, we ask ourselves, monsieur, what does it mean? One does not wish to gossip, but there is much here to wonder at!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, ha! Mrs. Ponsonby <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> pretty <b>little</b> {{literary}} soiree. Don't be too proud, it {{was only}} ourselves, except that Mary brought in Miss Conway. Jem tried to read it, but after he had made that Spanish Society into 'Hammer men dead,' Mary got it away from him, and read through {{as if it had}} been in print.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Most of what {{is known}} about Claudius stems from his 1685 meeting with the visiting French Jesuit missionary, Father Guy Tachard. After seeing two large volumes of his works, Tachard ventured that Claudius was a {{competent}} painter of plants and animals, and that if the books had been for sale he would have purchased them for Louis XIV of France. Some of his further and rather indiscreet revelations in Voyage de Siam led to Claudius' deportation to Mauritius and Batavia by Simon van der Stel - Tachard wrote [...] "It is from him that we obtained all our knowledge of the country. He <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> map made by his own hand." [...] This, during a period when the Dutch occupiers of the Cape were extremely suspicious of the French and their designs on the southern tip of Africa.|$|R
60|$|I had seated myself, {{sick and}} dazed, upon the settee, for scenes of bloodshed were {{new to me}} then, and this one had been enough to shock the most hardened. Savary <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> all <b>a</b> <b>little</b> cognac from his flask, and then tearing {{down one of the}} {{curtains}} he laid it over the terrible figure of my Uncle Bernac.|$|R
