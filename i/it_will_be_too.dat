5|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) hesitates {{to take a}} new {{murder case}} because he fears <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> {{difficult}} to solve, so it is taken on by his partner Howard (Melissa Leo), who has recently experienced a perfect streak of solving 11 consecutive cases. They investigate the body of a man dead in a basement, and much to Felton's bewilderment, Howard solves the case easily. The owner of the house, Jerry Jempson (Jim Grollman), literally calls her at the house while she is investigating and agrees to a police interview, during which he acts extremely nervous and is eventually charged with the murder.|$|E
5|$|Later, Walt and Jesse {{dispose of}} Victor's body, the gun that killed Gale, {{and the box}} cutter in a barrel of {{hydrofluoric}} acid. During breakfast later, Walt insists to Jesse that Gale's death was necessary, but expresses concern that Gus will kill them at his next opportunity. Jesse doubts this, believing <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> much trouble for Gus to find another drug manufacturer, and that both they and Gus understand the situation: neither can kill the other, so Gus might as well make them wish they were dead. The episode ends with police investigating Gale's apartment with the camera focusing on his lab notes which {{have yet to be}} discovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{members of the}} Sicilian aristocracy who still inhabit their ancestral palazzi are unable to make opening their houses to tourism {{a major source of}} income, unlike some Northern, especially English, counterparts. The local equivalent of the National Trust is very small, and there is much less local interest among the general population. The Princes, Marquesses, and Counts of Sicily still living in their houses dwell in splendid isolation, surrounded often by beauty and decay. It is only today both owners and the state are awakening to the possibility that if action is not taken soon <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> late to save this particular part of the Sicilian heritage.|$|E

25|$|Climate {{change was}} {{referred}} to in several of Giddens’s books from the mid-1990s onwards, but was not discussed at length until {{the publication of his}} work The Politics of Climate Change in 2009. Climate change, Giddens says, constitutes a fundamental threat to the future of industrial civilisation as it spreads across the globe. Given that is the case, he asks, why are countries around the world doing so little to counter its advance? Many reasons are involved, but the prime one is the historical novelty of humanly induced climate change itself. No previous civilisation intervened into nature on a level remotely similar to that which we do on an everyday level today. We have no previous experience of dealing with such an issue and especially one of such global scope, or of the dangers it poses. Those dangers hence appear as abstract, and located at some indefinite point in the future. ‘Giddens’s paradox’ consists of the following theorem. We are likely put off responding adequately to climate change until major catastrophes unequivocally connected to it occur; but by then by definition <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> late. For {{we have no way of}} reversing the build-up of greenhouses gases that is driving the transformation of the world’s climate. Some such gases will be in the atmosphere for centuries.|$|E
500|$|On 10 August, Eugene sent {{an urgent}} {{dispatch}} reporting {{that he was}} falling back to Donauwörth – [...] "The enemy have marched. It is almost certain that the whole army is crossing the Danube at Lauingen ... The plain of Dillingen is crowded with troops ... Everything, milord, consists in speed and that you put yourself forthwith in movement to join me tomorrow, without which I fear <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> late." [...] By a series of brilliant marches Marlborough concentrated his forces on Donauwörth and, by noon 11 August, the link-up was complete.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of the Allied invasion, the Germans had laid almost six million mines in Northern France. More gun emplacements and minefields {{extended}} inland along roads leading away from the beaches. In likely landing spots for gliders and parachutists, the Germans emplanted slanted poles with sharpened tops, which the troops called Rommelspargel ("Rommel's Asparagus"). Low-lying river and estuarine areas were intentionally flooded. Rommel believed that Germany would inevitably be defeated unless the invasion could be stopped on the beach, declaring, [...] "It is absolutely necessary that we push the British and Americans back from the beaches. Afterwards <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> late; the first 24 hours of the invasion will be decisive." ...|$|E

500|$|Thompson {{also criticized}} Bill Gates and Microsoft for {{contracting}} with Rockstar Games {{to release the}} game on the Xbox. The Xbox version has since been cancelled for undisclosed reasons, but a version was released years later on the Xbox 360. In August 2006, Thompson requested a congressional subpoena for an early copy, threatening to file suit in Miami {{if he did not}} gain help from U.S. Rep. Cliff Stearns. Once the game is out, according to Thompson, [...] "the horse will be out of the barn and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> late to do anything about it". Thompson argued that it violated Florida's public nuisance laws, which prohibit activities that can injure the health of the community.|$|E
500|$|Having {{previously}} {{discovered that}} his wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) was faking her pregnancy, Will tells her he no longer {{feels the same way}} he did when they first fell in love. He later attends Ken and Emma's delayed wedding, only to find that Ken has ended the relationship as a result of Emma's feelings for Will. She announces her intention to leave McKinley High School, explaining that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> painful for her to carry on working with Will and Ken. Back at school, Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) suspends cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) for leaking the glee club's set list, and has Will reinstated as the director of New Directions. The glee club members show Will their trophy and perform [...] "My Life Would Suck Without You" [...] for him. As Emma prepares to leave the school, Will chases after her and stops her with a kiss. Both are happy, but uncertain of what will happen next.|$|E
500|$|Paul asks Mary Alice’s {{neighbors and}} friends, Susan (Teri Hatcher), Lynette (Felicity Huffman), Bree (Marcia Cross) and Gabrielle (Eva Longoria), {{to go through}} her clothes and other {{belongings}} and then pack them up, as he thinks <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> hard for him. The women end up finding a letter addressed to Mary Alice, a blackmail note reading, [...] "I know what you did, it makes me sick, I’m going to tell." [...] Thereafter, the women make a series of discoveries concerning Mary Alice’s past and her possible motives for ending her life; she was being treated by Dr. Albert Goldfine (Sam Lloyd) where she revealed that she once went by the name Angela, and she may {{have had something to}} do with a baby that went missing. [...] Paul soon discovers who sent Mary Alice the note, their next-door neighbor struggling with financial difficulty, Martha Huber (Christine Estabrook), whom he ends up strangling to death out of pure rage and burying her body in the nearby forest. Meanwhile, her son Zach begins having flashbacks and is under the impression he killed a baby named Dana, who he believed to be his younger sister and reveals this to Julie Mayer (Andrea Bowen), Susan’s daughter. Paul worries over what Susan is spreading about their family, so he tells Susan in private that Zach accidentally killed his younger sister, Dana, and that he and Mary Alice covered it up to protect him. However, it becomes evident that this is not the case when Paul tells Zach that Dana is still very much alive.|$|E

2500|$|On September 14, 2007, Palin {{signed an}} {{administrative}} order creating a Climate Change Sub-Cabinet charged with preparing a climate change strategy for Alaska. [...] Palin ignored requests {{to establish an}} Alaska Office on Climate Change, an Alaska Climate Response Fund, and emissions reduction targets. Within her executive order, Palin described warming as a [...] "global challenge" [...] and sought [...] "opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from Alaska sources, including the expanded use of alternative fuels, energy conservation, energy efficiency, renewable energy, land use management, and transportation planning." [...] In April 2009 Palin acknowledged that [...] "Simply waiting for low-carbon-emitting renewable capacity to be large enough will mean that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> late to meet the mitigation goals for reducing [...] that will be required under most credible climate-change models."

2500|$|In a {{memorandum}} sent to Berlin demanding {{the removal of}} German ambassador Paul Wolff Metternich because he interceded {{on behalf of the}} Armenians, Talaat reaffirmed such a commitment: [...] "the work must be done now, after the war <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> late." [...] By the end of the war, the subsequent German ambassador Johann von Bernstorff described his discussion with Talaat: [...] "When I kept on pestering him about the Armenian question, he once said with a smile: 'What on earth do you want? The question is settled, there are no more Armenians'". A similar statement by Talaat was made to Swedish military attaché Einar af Wirsén: [...] "The way the Armenian problem was solved was hair-raising. I can still see in front of me Talaat's cynical expression, when he emphasized that the Armenian question was solved." [...] Talaat is reported to have said the following to American ambassador Henry Morgenthau, Sr. (as recorded in Ambassador Morgenthau's Story), who confronted Talaat on several occasions: [...] "I have accomplished more toward solving the Armenian problem in three months than Abdulhamid II accomplished in thirty years!" [...] Morgenthau then relates an exchange he had with Talaat: ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1933 {{establishment}} of a Nazi regime in Germany brought Fondane into the camp of anti-fascism. In December 1934, his Apelul studențimii ("The Call of Students") was circulated among the Romanian diaspora, and featured passionate calls for awareness: [...] "Tomorrow, in concentration camps, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> late". The following year, he outlined his critique {{of all kinds of}} totalitarianism, L'Écrivain devant la révolution ("The Writer Facing the Revolution"), supposed to be delivered in front of the Paris-held International Congress of Writers for the Defense of Culture (organized by left-wing and communist intellectuals with support from the Soviet Union). According to historian Martin Stanton, Fondane's activity in film, like Jean-Paul Sartre's parallel beginnings as a novelist, was itself a political statement in support of the Popular Front: [...] " [...] hoping to introduce critical dimensions in the fields they felt the fascists had colonized." [...] Fondane nevertheless ridiculed the communist version of pacifism as a [...] "parade of big words", noting that it opposed mere slogans to concrete German re-armament. Writing for the film magazine Les Cahiers Jaunes in 1933, he expressed the ambition of creating [...] "an absurd film about something absurd, to satisfy [...] absurd taste for freedom".|$|E
