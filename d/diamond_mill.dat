40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this study is}} to verify the {{possibility}} to monitor <b>diamond</b> <b>mill</b> wear by measuring the cutting force during stone machining. An ornamental stone was machined on an NC machining centre, retrofitted with a 3 -axis dynamometer and data acquisition systems, to investigate the effects of variations in machining parameters. The sensor data include cutting force measurements, further divided into measurable components, such as x, y, and z. Those components were analysed to determine the sensory features that best correlate with <b>diamond</b> <b>mill</b> wear. Tool wear and machining parameters appeared significantly influencing cutting force signals. This suggests that even under the varying cutting conditions involving different values of process parameters, the identified cutting force feature can be used for the reliable and accurate control of <b>diamond</b> <b>mill</b> wear during stone cutting operations.

40|$|Abstract. K 9 {{glass is}} {{regarded}} as one of the most difficult-to-machine materials due to its mechanical characteristics, which is known as an excellent performance optical material. In this paper, rotary ultrasonic face milling (RUFM) process is introduced into machining flat surface of K 9 glass using right-angle diamond cutter for the first time. It studies the influence of process variables (spindle speed, feedrate, cutting depth, and cutting width) on cutting force and surface roughness through the single-factor experiments. The cutting force is measured by a KISTLER dynamometer, and the surface roughness is measured by a talysurf. The investigation also includes a comparison between RUFM and <b>diamond</b> <b>milling.</b> The experimental results tell that the RUFM process can significantly reduce cutting force, which inferred that RUFM can have less tool wear and longer tool life. It also shows that the surface roughness in RUFM of K 9 glass is slightly higher than that obtained in <b>diamond</b> <b>milling...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{the late}} 1960 s Alvarez and Lohmann {{independently}} suggested cubic phase plates as varifocal elements.

We present a non-paraxial analysis of the imaging behavior of diffractive, refractive and hybrid Alvarez-Lohmann lenses with increased numerical aperture. Our analysis includes the influence of lateral focus shifts as well as monochromatic and polychromatic aberrations over the tuning range.

40|$|Abstract—Substitution of {{a single}} {{aspheric}} microlens (array) for a complex multilens system results in not only smaller size, lighter weight, compacter geometry, and even possibly lower cost of an optical system, but also significant improvement of its optical performance such as better imaging quality. However, fabrication of aspheric microlens or microlens array is technically chal-lenging because conventional technologies used for macro-sized aspheres like single-point <b>diamond</b> <b>milling,</b> and those for spher-ical microlens like thermal reflow, are not capable of defining a complicated lens profile in an area as small as several to tens of micrometers. Here we solve the problem by using femtosecond laser micro-nanofabrication via two photon polymerization. Not only well-defined single lens, but also 100 % filling ratio aspheric microlens array were readily produced. The average error of the lens profile is only 17. 3 nm deviated from the theoretical model, the smallest error reported so far.
