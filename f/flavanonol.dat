40|$|Plant {{polyphenols}} receive significant attention due {{to their}} anti-oxidative and health-promoting properties, and several microorganisms are currently engineered towards producing these valuable compounds. Previously, Corynebacterium glutamicum has been engineered for synthesizing polyphenol core structures such as the stilbene resveratrol and the (2 S) -flavanone naringenin. Decoration of these compounds by O-methylation or hydroxylation would provide access to polyphenols of even higher commercial interest. In this study, introduction of a heterologous O-methyltransferase into a resveratrol-producing C. glutamicum strain allowed synthesis of 42 mg/L (0. 16 mM) of the di-O-methylated pterostilbene from p-coumaric acid. A prerequisite for reaching this product titer was a fusion of O-methyltransferase with the maltose-binding protein of Escherichia coli lacking its signal peptide, thereby increasing the solubility of the O-methyltransferase. Furthermore, expression of heterologous dioxygenase genes in (2 S) -flavanone-producing C. glutamicum strains enabled the production of <b>flavanonols</b> and flavonols starting from the phenylpropanoids p-coumaric acid and caffeic acid. For the flavonols kaempferol and quercetin, maximum product titers of 23 mg/L (0. 08 mM) and 10 mg/L (0. 03 mM) could be achieved, respectively.

Key structural features of flavonoids for inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake are the B-ring 4 ′- or 3 ′, 4 ′-OH group and the C-ring C 2 -C 3 double bond of the flavones and flavonols, the A-ring 5 -OH of isoflavones, and the galloyl group of EGCG and theaflavins. Luteolin significantly inhibits insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of insulin receptor-β subunit (IR-β), and apigenin, kaempferol, quercetin and fisetin, also tended to inhibit the IR-β phosphorylation. On the other hand, isoflavones, flavanols or flavanonols did not affect insulin-stimulated IR-β phosphorylation. Apigenin, luteolin, kaempferol, quercetin and fisetin also appeared to inhibit insulin-stimulated activation of Akt, a pivotal downstream effector of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K), and suppressed insulin-dependent translocation of a glucose transporter, (GLUT) 4, into the plasma membrane. Although genistein, silybin, EGCG and theaflavins {{had no effect on}} the insulin-stimulated activation of Akt, they blocked insulin-dependent GLUT 4 translocation. These results provide novel insights into the modulation by flavonoids of insulin's actions, including glucose uptake in adipocytes. © 2008 Pharmaceutical Society of Japan...|$|E
40|$|Hironori TsuchiyaDepartment of Dental Basic Education, Asahi University School of Dentistry, Mizuho, Gifu, JapanBackground: In {{order to}} {{understand}} the antiproliferative effect of red wine in mechanistic terms, the membrane interactions of flavonoid components and their related structures were compared using liposomal biomimetic membranes prepared with different phospholipids and cholesterol. Methods and results: A series of fluorescence polarization measurements revealed that anthocyanidins, flavones, flavonols, flavanones, <b>flavanonols,</b> isoflavones, catechins, and chalcones interact with biomimetic membranes in a structure-dependent manner to decrease their fluidity at concentrations of 1 &ndash; 10 &micro;M by preferentially acting in the deeper regions of the lipid bilayers. In the structure and membrane interactivity relationship, greater membrane-interacting potency was associated with a 3 -hydroxyl group and a double bond between the 2 -carbon and 3 -carbon of the C ring, 3 &rsquo;, 4 &rsquo;-dihydroxyl groups of the B ring, and 5, 7 -dihydroxyl groups of the A ring. Cyanidin, quercetin, and (&ndash;) -epigallocatechin gallate meet these structural requirements, and were effective in inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells, showing inhibition rates of 16. 4 % and 35. 4 %, 23. 3 % and 74. 3 %, and 31. 3 % and 75. 5 %, respectively, after culture for 24 and 48 hours. These antiproliferative flavonoids simultaneously decreased the membrane fluidity of tumor cells depending on culture time. The rank order of cell membrane rigidification [(&ndash;) -epigallocatechin gallate &gt; quercetin &gt; cyanidin] was consistent with inhibition of cell proliferation. Conclusion: Membrane interaction is very likely to underlie the antiproliferative effects of wine flavonoids. Membrane-interactive flavonoid components would contribute to the functionality of red wine. Keywords: red wine, flavonoid, membrane interaction, fluidity change, antiproliferative effec...|$|R
40|$|Seven millet {{varieties}} {{grown in}} Sri Lanka (proso, foxtail, finger (Ravi), finger (local), kodo, and little) and India (pearl) {{were used in}} this study. Soluble and bound phenolics obtained by solvent extraction were used to evaluate antioxidant, DNA scission and enzyme inhibitory and antiproliferative activities by several chemical and biological methods. Distribution of phenolics and their antioxidant activity was assessed in dehulled grains and hulls separated by air classification. Phenolic compounds in free, soluble conjugates and insoluble bound fractions were identified and quantified. In addition, accessibility of phenolics in the digestive tract was determined using a simulated in vitro digestion model and colonic fermentation. The contents of total phenolics (TPC),total flavonoids (TFC) and proanthocyanidins (PC) as well as scavenging activities of test compounds were evaluated using superoxide, hydroxyl, peroxyl, 2, 2 -diphenyl-l-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical, H₂O₂, and singlet oxygen. Different concentrations of extract {{were used to determine}} their IC₅₀ values. In addition, the ferrous chelating and reducing activities of extracts were measured. The highest phenolic content of soluble phenolics of millet grains was obtained with 70 % (v/v) acetone for 25 minutes under reflux conditions. The TPC of soluble and insoluble bound phenolic fractions of millet varieties were 7. 2 - 32. 4 and 2. 2 - 81. 6 μmol ferulic acid eq/g defatted meal, respectively. This demonstrates that bound phenolics are important contributors to antioxidant potential of millets. Kodo millet showed the highest soluble phenolic content followed by finger (local), finger (Ravi), little, foxtail, pearl and proso millets. Millets with dark brown pigmented testa and pericarp possessed a higher soluble phenolic content than those with white or yellow testa and pericarp. The TFC of soluble and insoluble extracts were 1. 2 - 33. 7 and 0. 3 - 4. 5 μmol catechin eq (CE) /g defatted meal, respectively. The soluble extracts of finger (local) millet had the highest PC (311. 28 μmol CE/g defatted meal). All varieties exhibited effective radical, H₂O₂ and singlet oxygen inhibition, reducing activity as well as ferrous ion chelating power which varied according to the assay employed and the variety used. Several hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids were identified and quantified by HPLC analysis. In general, ferulic and ρ-coumaric were found to be the major phenolic acids followed by protocatechuic, caffeic, sinapic, ρ-hydroxybenzoic, gentisic, and vanillic acids and their contents depended on the variety and the form present in the grain matrix. Flavonoids identified were flavones, flavan- 3 -ol monomers and dimers, and <b>flavanonols.</b> All seven varieties effectively inhibited oxidation in a pork model system, and stripped corn oil. At a concentration of 0. 5 mg/ml all extracts inhibited oxidation by 16 - 88 % in the linoleic acid emulsion system. All phenolic extracts inhibited Cu (II) -induced human LDL and liposome oxidation and DNA scission. Millet extracts at 0. 05 mg/mL inhibited LDL cholesterol oxidation by 1 - 41 % and exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of DNA scission. The antiprolifeative studies showed that kodo millet extract inhibited HT- 29 cells proliferation in the range of 75 - 100 % after 4 days of incubation. The hulls from dehulled millets had higher TPC and antioxidant activity compared to their whole, dehulled and cooked grain counterparts. The phenolic extracts of dehulled millet grains, following in vitro enzymic digestion under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and colonic fermentation, showed effective antioxidant activity and were accessible under physiological conditions...|$|R
40|$|Reactive species, {{including}} free radicals, {{have been}} implicated in ageing and various diseases. The human body possesses an antioxidant defense system that acts in the detoxification and elimination of those species. Nevertheless, natural matrices can give an exogenous contribution, providing antioxidant biomolecules {{such is the case}} of phenolic compounds. Origanum vulgare L. (oregano) could be one of those matrices since various studies already reported the antioxidant potential of its methanolic extract and essential oils. Nonetheless, the reports using aqueous extracts are scarce, mainly in decoction or infusion preparations traditionally used to their digestive, expectorant, antiseptic and antispasmodic properties. In the present work, the antioxidant properties (reducing power- RP, free radicals scavenging activity- RSA and lipid peroxidation inhibition- LPI) and phenolic compounds of the infusion, decoction and hydroalcoholic extract of oregano (obtained from Soria Natural, Spain) were evaluated and compared. The infusion and decoction presented similar RP and RSA, showing the decoction higher LPI. Both preparations gave higher antioxidant activity than the hydroalcoholic extract. Twenty-two phenolic compounds were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS: seven phenolic acids (caffeoylquinic, syringic, protocatequic and rosmarinic acids, and derivatives), six flavonols (quercetin, kaempferol and myrecitrin derivatives), five flavones (apigenin and luteolin derivatives), one <b>flavanonol</b> (taxifolin) and one flavanone (eriodictyol). Rosmarinic acid and luteolin- 7 -O-glucoside were the main phenolic acid and flavonoid, respectively, in all the preparations. Data obtained provide more scientific evidences to the traditional medicinal uses of oregano, mainly in the treatment of oxidative stress-associated diseases.
