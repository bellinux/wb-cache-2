A driving {{question}} in (quantum) cohomology of flag varieties {{is to find}} non-recursive, positive combinatorial formulas for expressing the product of two classes in a particularly nice ba-sis, called the Schubert basis. Bertram, Ciocan-Fontanine and Fulton provided a way to compute quantum products of Schubert classes in the Grassmannian of k-planes in complex n-space by doing classical multiplication and then applying a combinatorial rim <b>hook</b> <b>rule</b> which yields the quantum parameter. In this paper, we provide a generalization of this rim <b>hook</b> <b>rule</b> to the setting {{in which there is}} also an action of the complex torus. Combining this result with Knutson and Tao’s puzzle rule then gives an effective algorithm for computing the equivariant quantum Littlewood-Richardson co-efficients.

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{algebraic}} topology, cohomology is an algebraic topological invariant that, because of its ring structure, is especially useful for providing information about topological spaces. Quantum cohomology, used mainly in algebraic geometry, is in general a slightly more refined version of cohomology {{in the sense that}} it often tells us more information about a topological space than its classical counterpart. In this thesis we will study flag manifolds, in particular the Grassmannian and the full flag manifold, using classical and quantum Borel-Moore cohomology. The classical and quantum cohomology rings of flag manifolds each have a finite basis of Schubert classes and there exist formulae (first formulated in the classical case by D. E. Littlewood and A. R. Richardson in their 1934 paper Group Characters and Algebra ([9]) and in the quantum case by W. Fulton and C. Woodward in their 2004 paper On the Quantum Product of Schubert Classes to express the classical product of 'simple' Schubert classes in terms of these bases. In their 1999 paper Quantum Multiplication of Schur Polynomials, A. Bertram, I. Ciocan-Fontanine, and Fulton provide an algorithm to express the quantum products of two Schubert classes in the quantum cohomology ring of the Grassmannian in terms of this basis. They do so by first computing the classical product in a higher dimensional Grassmannian, and then removing 'rim hooks' from the Young diagrams that index the classes while adding in powers of the quantum variable based on properties of the rim hooks removed. This thesis works towards finding an analog of the rim <b>hook</b> <b>rule</b> for general flag manifolds...|$|E
40|$|Finding {{connected}} components (CC) of an {{undirected graph}} {{is a fundamental}} computational problem. Various CC algorithms exist for PRAM models. An implementation of a PRAM CC algorithm on a coarse-grain MIMD machine with distributed memory brings many problems, since the communication overhead is substantial compared to the local computation. Several implementations of CC algorithms on distributed memory machines have been described in the literature, all in Split-C. We have designed and implemented a CC algorithm in C ++ and MPI, by combining {{the ideas of the}} previous PRAM and distributed memory algorithms. Our main optimization is based on replacing the conditional <b>hooking</b> by <b>rules</b> for reducing nontrivial cycles during the contraction of components. We have also implemented a method for reducing the number of exchanged messages which is based on buffering messages and on deferred processing of answers...|$|R

Lalonde {{spent most of the}} fight backpedaling and looking to land his right hand. Hill {{controlled}} the fight, landing frequently with jabs and hooks while avoiding Lalonde's powerful right. Hill won by a ten-round unanimous decision. It was Lalonde's last fight. He finished with a record of 41-5-1 with 33 knockouts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Coordination {{languages}} for ad hoc networks with a fluid topology do {{not offer}} adequate support to detect and deal with device disconnection. Such a disconnection is particularly relevant if the device provided context information rather than emitting messages, as such context information then becomes invalid. This paper proposed the Fact Space Model which establishes a logic coordination language on top of Lime’s federated tuple space. In the model, the federated space offers applications a consistent view of their environment over which they can reason using logic rules. These rules encode which conclusions may {{be drawn from the}} presence of particular facts, and are similarly used to en-sure the consistency of these conclusions when devices go out of range. By allowing applications to add application-specific <b>hooks</b> to these <b>rules,</b> the application programmer is offered a general-purpose mechanism to respond to the discovery and disconnection of devices. ...|$|R
