500|$|As {{one of the}} {{youngest}} majors in the army, Middleton found himself among officers who were ten to fifteen years his senior at the Army's Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Students attended this ten-month school to qualify for higher commands. [...] Here Middleton met a classmate, George Patton, who would become one of his friends. Patton had confided to Middleton that he predicted completing the course as an Honor Graduate, one who finishes in the top 25% of the nearly 200 students. His prediction came true, and he finished 14th in the class. Middleton finished 8th.

500|$|Upon {{assuming}} {{the presidency in}} January 1961, John F. Kennedy was committed to pursuing a comprehensive test ban and ordered {{a review of the}} American negotiating position in an effort to accelerate languishing talks, believing Eisenhower's approach to have been [...] "insufficient." [...] In making his case for a test ban, Kennedy drew a direct link between continued testing and nuclear proliferation, calling it the [...] "'Nth-country' problem." [...] While a candidate, Kennedy had argued, [...] "For once China, or France, or Sweden, or <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>other</b> nations successfully test an atomic bomb, the security of both Russians and Americans is dangerously weakened." [...] He had also claimed that renewed testing would be [...] "damaging to the American image" [...] and might threaten the [...] "existence of human life." [...] On the campaign trail, Kennedy's test-ban proposal consisted of a continued US testing moratorium, expanded efforts to reach a comprehensive agreement, limit any future tests to those minimizing fallout, and expand research on fallout. Notably, early in his term, Kennedy also presided over a significant increase in defense spending, which was reciprocated by the Soviet Union shortly thereafter, thus placing the test-ban negotiations {{in the context of an}} accelerating arms race.|$|E

Its type species, Omosaurus armatus, was named in 1875, based on a skeleton found in England. In 1902 the genus was renamed into Dacentrurus because the name Omosaurus had already been used for a crocodilian. After 1875, <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>other</b> species would be named but perhaps only Dacentrurus armatus is valid.|$|E
