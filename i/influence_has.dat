5|$|Additional archaeological {{evidence}} of Roman <b>influence</b> <b>has</b> been found, in particular at Les Landes, the coastal headland site at Le Pinacle, where {{remains of a}} primitive structure are attributed to Gallo-Roman temple worship (fanum).|$|E
5|$|His <b>influence</b> <b>has</b> been wide-ranging. In India, S. K. Maitra, Anilbaran Roy and D. P. Chattopadhyaya {{commented on}} Sri Aurobindo's work. Writers on esotericism and {{traditional}} wisdom, such as Mircea Eliade, Paul Brunton, and Rene Guenon, all {{saw him as}} an authentic representative of the Indian spiritual tradition.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} applications, the <b>influence</b> <b>has</b> also been {{reversed}} to motivate geometric constructions by a group-theoretical background. In a similar vein, geometric group theory employs geometric concepts, {{for example in}} the study of hyperbolic groups. Further branches crucially applying groups include algebraic geometry and number theory.|$|E

5|$|The 1st-centuryAD rhetorician Quintilian ranked Philitas {{second only}} to Callimachus among the elegiac poets. Philitas' <b>influence</b> <b>has</b> been found or {{suspected}} {{in a wide range}} of ancient writing; Longus' 2nd centuryAD novel Daphnis and Chloe contains a character likely named after him. Almost all that he wrote seems to have disappeared within two centuries, though, so it is unlikely that any writer later than the 2nd centuryBC read any but a few of his lines.|$|E
5|$|The ITV {{franchisee}} Granada Television {{is partially}} headquartered {{in the old}} Granada Studios site on Quay Street and the new location at MediaCityUK {{as part of the}} initial phase of its migration to Salford Quays. It produces Coronation Street, local news and programmes for North West England. Although its <b>influence</b> <b>has</b> waned Granada had been described as 'the best commercial television company in the world'.|$|E
5|$|Though {{relatively}} short-lived, Nation of Ulysses' <b>influence</b> <b>has</b> been substantial: {{they have}} been cited as influences for bands such as The (International) Noise Conspiracy, The Hives, Thursday, Refused, Boysetsfire, Bikini Kill, Rocket From The Crypt, Antioch Arrow, The Locust, At The Drive-in, LCD Soundsystem, and Huggy Bear, among many others.|$|E
50|$|Their {{earlier work}} was ‘West Coast Ceilidh’ inspired, with Celtic <b>influences</b> which <b>have</b> {{remained}} {{present in all}} their work. As the band have developed, rock, pop, jazz, Cajun and country <b>influences</b> <b>have</b> all emerged, but the traditional Celtic roots and instrumentation have remained.|$|R

5|$|Critics of the ESRB have {{asserted}} that the organization has {{a conflict of interest}} because of its vested interest in the video game industry, and that the ESRB does not rate certain games, such as the Grand Theft Auto series, harshly enough for their violent or sexual content in order to protect their commercial viability. Contrarily, other critics have argued that, at the same time, the ESRB rates certain games too strongly for their content, and that its <b>influence</b> <b>has</b> stifled the viability of adult-oriented video games due to the board's restrictions on how they are marketed and sold.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, {{a survey}} {{conducted}} for the Library of Congress and the Book-of-the-Month Club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondent's life was. Rand's Atlas Shrugged was the second most popular choice, after the Bible. Rand's books continue to be widely sold and read, with over 29million copies sold as of 2013 (with about 10% of that total purchased for free distribution to schools by the Ayn Rand Institute). In 1998, Modern Library readers voted Atlas Shrugged the 20th century's finest work of fiction, followed by The Fountainhead in second place, Anthem in seventh, and We the Living eighth; none of the four appeared on the critics' list. Although Rand's <b>influence</b> <b>has</b> been greatest in the United States, there has been international interest in her work. Rand's work continues {{to be among the}} top sellers among books in India.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{greatest}} influences on Cantillon's writing was English economist William Petty and his 1662 tract Treatise on Taxes. Although Petty provided much of the groundwork for Cantillon's Essai, Anthony Brewer argues that Petty's <b>influence</b> <b>has</b> been overstated. Apart from Petty, other possible influences on Cantillon include John Locke, Cicero, Livy, Pliny the Elder, Pliny the Younger, Charles Davenant, Edmond Halley, Isaac Newton, Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban, and Jean Boisard. Cantillon's involvement in John Law's speculative bubble proved invaluable and likely heavily influenced his insight {{on the relationship between}} increases in the supply of money, price, and production.|$|E

5|$|Much of Havelock's {{work was}} devoted to {{addressing}} a single thesis: that all of Western thought is informed by a profound shift {{in the kinds of}} ideas available to the human mind at the point that Greek philosophy converted from an oral to a literate form. The idea has been very controversial in classical studies, and has been rejected outright both by many of Havelock's contemporaries and modern classicists. Havelock and his ideas have nonetheless had far-reaching influence, both in classical studies and other academic areas. He and Walter J. Ong (who was himself strongly influenced by Havelock) essentially founded the field that studies transitions from orality to literacy, and Havelock {{has been one of the}} most frequently cited theorists in that field; as an account of communication, his work profoundly affected the media theories of Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan. Havelock's <b>influence</b> <b>has</b> spread beyond the study of the classical world to that of analogous transitions in other times and places.|$|E
5|$|The governor's {{powers are}} {{enumerated}} {{in the state}} constitution. There have been four constitutions of Kentucky—adopted in 1792, 1799, 1850, and 1891, respectively—and each has enlarged the governor's authority. Among the powers appropriated to the governor in the constitution are the ability to grant pardons, veto legislation, and call the legislature into session. The governor serves as commander-in-chief of the state's military forces and is empowered to enforce all laws of the state. The officeholder is given broad statutory authority to make appointments to the various cabinets and departments of the executive branch, limited somewhat by {{the adoption of a}} merit system for state employees in 1960. Because Kentucky's governor controls so many appointments to commissions, the office has been historically {{considered one of the most}} powerful state executive positions in the United States. Additionally, the governor's <b>influence</b> <b>has</b> been augmented by wide discretion in awarding state contracts and significant influence over the legislature, although the latter has been waning since the mid-1970s.|$|E

25|$|Despite the criticism, the {{influence}} of the Scottish school was notable for example upon American pragmatism, and modern Thomism.

25|$|Through the Srivijaya and Majapahit empires, Hindu <b>influence</b> <b>has</b> been {{visible in}} Philippine {{history from the}} 10th to 14th centuries.
