And how I remembered the {{consequent}} changes--the paths beginning to form as the goats literally ate {{their way through the}} dense thickets; the disappearance of the younger, smaller bushes that were not too tall for total browsing; the vistas that formed in all directions through the older, taller bushes, as the goats browsed as high as they could stand and reach on their hind legs; the driftage of the pasture grasses that followed {{in the wake of the}} clearing by the goats. Yes, the continuity of such dreaming was its charm. Came the day when the men with axes chopped down all the taller brush so as to give the goats access to the leaves and buds and bark. Came the day, in winter weather, when the dry denuded skeletons of all these bushes were gathered into heaps and burned. Came the day when I moved my goats on to other brush-impregnable hillsides, with following in their wake my cattle, pasturing knee-deep in the succulent grasses that grew where before had been only brush. And came the day when I moved my cattle on, and my plough-men went back and forth across the slopes' contour--ploughing the rich sod under to rot to live and crawling <b>humous</b> in which to bed my seeds of crops to be.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{kinetics}} of Cd, Pb and Cr extraction with EDTA (ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic acid) from artificially polluted chernozem and <b>humous</b> alluvial soils was investigated. The {{efficiency of}} the extraction was for Cd more than 95 %, for Pb more than 80 % (chernozem soil) and more than 95 % (<b>humous</b> alluvial soil). In both cases, the extraction reached equilibrium state. For Cd and Pb the metal-ion removal processes, in the first 30 minutes of extraction, can be modelled by two simultaneous, pseudo-first order, irreversible reactions. One of the reactions is fast and {{can be attributed to}} complex formation reactions between EDTA and metal ions occurring on the surface of inorganic minerals and humus-compounds and to the dissolution of the water-insoluble precipitates. The less part of the metal ions took part in a rather slow reaction, where EDTA complexed heavy metal ions bound in the internal lattice sites. The slow dissolution of the metal compounds should also be considered. The slow extraction partly can be attributed to slow irreversible processes (e. g. diffusion from the internal lattice sites). In the case of Cr(III), the extraction was found to be a very slow process, the efficiency of removal was less than 3 %. The system did not attain the equilibrium state. Probably the rates of extraction processes are intermediate between those of the slow and fast reactions...|$|E

40|$|A PALAEOBOTANICAL STUDY OF THE WIJSTER SETTLEMENT The palaeobotanical {{investigation}} of the Wijster settlement comprises the following aspects: 1. Wood identification {{of a number of}} objects. The results of the identifications have been mentioned by Van Es in the description of the objects concerned, and they will not be repeated here. 1 2. Palynological {{investigation of}} a number of soil samples. 3. The investigation of a sample of carbonized grain (find no. 1239). A. PALYNOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION The following samples have been studied palynologically: 1. <b>Humous</b> layer (A-I horizon) of a heather podzol profile which was covered by drift sand (Section A 1, Fig. 5). Sample I must be older than the beginning of the settlement, since the latter was situated on top of the drift sand. II. <b>Humous</b> layer (A-I horizon) of a podzol profile, above which a layer of arable soil was present (Section C, Fig. 5). The old arable was cut by a foundation trench of the settlement. III. Spade mark from the westernmost field (Fig. I 81, III). IV. Spade mark from the easternmost field (Fig. 181, IV). V. <b>Humous</b> layer on top of arable soil which must be younger than the settlement, as it cuts through post holes of the latter (Section C, Fig. 5). VI. <b>Humous</b> layer on top of arable soil (Section F, Fig. 5). In Section F, which cuts across the fields mentioned above, the spade marks could be observed at the basis of the old arable. In the old arable a distinction could be made, at least locally, between the lower layer to which the spade marks belong, and an upper layer which must be correlated stratigraphically with the old arable of sample V. Sample VI was {{from the top of the}} upper layer. The results of the palynological investigation are represented in Table II. The values for the various pollen types are traditionally expressed as percentages of the tree pollen sum. The heather podzol profile of sample I corresponds stratigraphically with the blown-over podzol which could be observed below the burial mounds on the Emelange, ca. 500 m. east of the Wijster settlement. 2 Consequently, the spectrum of sample I agrees well with both spectra of the lower podzol on the Emelange. Only the Quercus (oak) percentage in sample I is lower than that in the corresponding Emelange spectra, but this can be the effect of a difference in pollen preservation. Sample I has been analysed in order to serve as a basis for comparison with the stratigraphically younger samples. As the position of sample II with respect to the settlement does not appear clearly from the section, sample III which undoubtedly belongs to the settlement will be discussed first. It would be logical to discuss samples III and IV, both from spade marks in fields from the last period of the settlement, together. However, as the pollen contents of sample IV must be considered to be abnormal to some degree, discussion of this sample will be postponed until later. A comparison between samples I and III shows that in spectrum III the Corylus (hazel) percentage is lower and that for Fagus (beech) markedly higher than in spectrum 1. Also the herbaceous percentages show considerable differences in both samples. In sample I Calluna (heather) constitutes by far the largest part of the nontree pollen. In sample III, on the other hand, apart fromCalluna, Gramineae (grasses) also show a high percentage. Triticum-(wheat) type pollen is relatively common, and a large number of herbs are represented. The tree pollen percentages in samples II and III agree fairly well with each other, suggesting that the difference in time between both samples could not have been very great. Sample II shows a high percentage for grasses, while the values for Plantago lanceolata (ribwort plantain), Rumex (sorrel) and Trifolium repens (white clover) are relatively high, indicating that before this surface became sealed off it was used as pasture land. The presence of Triticum-type pollen demonstrates that agriculture must have been practised in the immediate vicinity. As the <b>humous</b> horizon of the podzol profile on the spot of sample II was undisturbed, there cannot have been a field there at that time. It is very likely that the human activity which is clearly reflected in the pollen contents of sample II must be ascribed to the inhabitants of the Wijster settlement. [...] . Zie: Appendix...|$|E

A KH 2 32 PO 4 solution was injected in the soil and the 32 P-uptake was estimated periodically in leaves or stems.

In deep <b>humous</b> sandy soils about 30 % of the total root activity in the layer 0 - 80 cm occurred in the layer 40 - 80 cm; in shallow soils this figure was about 10 %. In all profiles the 0 - 20 cm layer contributed about 50 %. The root mass accorded with root activity but its difference between the layers was much smaller. The effect on yield was clearest in dry years. Deeper and more intensive cultivation increased root activity and mass in the subsoil but the effect on the yield was small, depending on the type of crop and environmental conditions. In wet soils the root activity and mass decreased with increasing depth. In dry soils the root activity in the subsoil became higher than it was in the topsoil but did not prevent a reduction in yield...|$|E
40|$|The Tipulidae s. l. —craneflies—are one of {{the largest}} groups of the Diptera {{containing}} over 15, 270 valid species and subspecies. The immatures of the majority of species live in aquatic or semiaquatic habitats. Some aquatic species live entirely submerged and lack functional spiracles, others come to the surface to take oxygen by using spiracles positioned {{at the end of the}} abdomen. Semiaquatic species occur in a wide range of habitats. The semiterrestrial and terrestrial larvae live in environments that are moist or at least <b>humous.</b> All adult craneflies are terrestrial. Conflicting hypotheses on the phylogenetic position of the Tipuloidea within the Diptera continue to exist: some authors consider them to represent {{one of the}} oldest lineages of the Diptera, others suppose a close relationship to the Brachycera, the true flies. Current systematic knowledge of the Tipuloidea indicates that the Palaearctic region contains the highest number of genus-group taxa, while the Neotropical region has the highest number of species and subspecies. The Afrotropical and Australasian regions are relatively poor respectively in genera and subgenera and in species and subspecies.

40|$|The Dutch Bulb Fields are {{situated}} on the Beach-ridge landscape between the Rhine Estuary and the Y-Polders in the mid-western part of North Holland and South Holland. Culture of some horticultural crops (tulips, daffodils) is important in this area because of the special requirements of these crops: rather coarse, calcareous, deep sandy and highly porous soils easy to penetrate by roots, without organic matter, without impermeable layers and a stable watertable. Continuous deep digging is inevitable. Soil formation (mainly decalcification) in the beach ridges over some 3000 years has caused non-calcareous topsoils and a slight podsolization; the soils have been improved by digging off sand. The area has been influenced by peat growth, marine and estuarine sediments and shifting sand. The soil survey resulted in a soil map, indicating soil quality. From the results ensued the recommendation of improving soil by suction dredging. This had to be planned and carried out very carefully, because the formation of <b>humous</b> and clayey layers in the new profile would make the soil completely unsuitable for valuable horticultural crops. Geological studies on Middle and Late Holocene geology and stratigraphy showed that the beach ridges were formed {{during and after the}} deposition of the Atlantic Old Marine Clay (4000 - 2000 B.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about an early medieval well, made of sods, from a Roman and medieval site in Naaldwijk, Zuid-Holland, the Netherlands. All the wood from this well, {{including}} part of a wooden wheel, was examined together with soil samples, one from the bottom filling of the well and one from the sods, {{for the presence of}} seeds. The main research question was: “How did the local vegetation look like {{at the time of the}} well, based on the examined wood and seeds?” A second complementary question was: “What was the character of the use of wood?” In the well wood of alder, oak, ash, willow, buckthorn and elder was found, possibly all of these have grown in the area near the settlement. Most of the found wood was of poor quality and together with the findings of branches of most of the taxa suggest the use of local wood and therefore the availability was the main factor in the choice of wood. Research of the seeds from the soil sample that was taken from the sods showed that the sods probably came from a clayey environment that given the amount of foraminifera in the sample, has possibly been under the influence of the sea. The discovered taxa in this sample seem to indicate a moist to wet, moderately brackish to brackish environment. The soil sample from the bottom filling of the well showed many arable weeds that seem to indicate the presence of lime-free, nitrogen-rich and moderate to rich farmland or vegetable gardens. There are indications for frequently entered environments with a rich soil, such as yards and roadsides. Also ample evidence was found of rarely entered brushwood with a reworked rich, <b>humous,</b> lime-free, dry soil, such as waste land and pastures. Some of these taxa are indicators for nitrogen and also occur in fields and can point to manuring of the soil. There are also many indications for the presence of grasslands and/ or pastures with a highly variable humidity and a moderately brackish to brackish soil, such as dune grasslands. However, determining the presence or absence of forests and the degree of openness of the landscape can only be done with additional pollen analysis...|$|E
40|$|The Lower Bavarian {{aeolian sand}} areas and sand dune {{landscape}} in the Abensberg/Siegenburg area (county/Landkreis Kelheim, Lower Bavaria) originated {{in an area}} where the Late Tertiary deltaic sediments of the Ur-Naab are overlain by a complex system of Pleistocene Danube gravels {{as well as those of}} the Abens river, deposited by in parts widely-shifting Quaternary river courses, mainly during the Riss glacial. This explains the absence of any significant loess cover of the area. The sand dunes and aeolian sands occurring there have been known for a long time, and their mostly late glacial age origin can be stratigraphically inferred. During the Holocene there were repeated phases of aeolian remobilisation, each of them related to an overexploitation of the carrying capacity of the landscape. It can be excluded that remobilisation was caused by changing climate. Today the dune fields, up to 10 m high, have partly been set aside as nature reserves, or are being used for agriculture and forestry. Based on geophysical prospection, at four selected dune chains and their surroundings, a distinction has been made between the underlying aeolian sand sheet, the dune cores, and younger aeolian accumulation bodies, and they have been sedimentologically characterised. The dune sands have been dated by OSL, macro-remains and the <b>humous</b> material of fossilised soil horizons by the radiocarbon method. Forest clearing of much of the landscape began during the Neolithic period, related to the operation of a flintstone mine at Arnhofen. Two significant phases of sand dune growth have been dated to the Bronze Age and the High Middle Ages, largely determining the aspect of the present dune landscape. There is evidence of younger remobilisation phases up to the 1950 s. With reduced settlement pressure, each time the dune landscape returned to a phase of morphodynamic stability, without any evidence of directed reforestation or dune stabilisation measures of the sands. Today, under the name of Durnbucher Forest, the former hunting preserve of the Wittelsbach noble family, the Abensberg/Siegenburg dune landscape is one of the largest contiguous forest areas of Bavaria. © 2011 Gebr.

40|$|The Pilot Farm Ježevo was {{established}} {{in accordance with the}} Project UNDP for Yugoslavia, with the aim of its future growing into an experimental station for heavy hydromorphic soils, which would have wider, international significance (ILACO, 1972). Pedological investigations under the above title were carried out within the theme „Investigations of complex agrotechnical practices on heavy soils in the Upper Save Valley - the Ježevo locality“. Their purpose was to determine: a) the basic parameters and changes in the consistence, depending on the moisture dynamics in the soil, b) potential and actual changes in volume, total porosity and air content in the soil, and c) their significance for the agriotechnical practice and, generally, for the exploitation of hydroarneliorated soils of the Farm. The investigations were carried out on the production plots 8, 19 and 17 with pipe drainage of various intensity (spaces 15, 20 and 25 m, depths 1. 1 and 1. 25 m). According to the marked oder of production plots, they are former: noncalcareous, vertic, <b>humous,</b> amphigley soils, mineral variety of amphigley soils, also noncalcareous and vertic, and - browned meadow soils. Standard methods (JDPZ, 1971) were used in the field and laboratory experiments, as well as more recent experiences of foreign authors (See Literature), The results are presented in Tables 1 - 5 and Graph 1. The lay-out of the Farm is shown in Figure 1. The following conclusions were drawn: 1. Heavy vertic soils of the Pilot Farm Ježevo have very unfavourable mechanical properties. In addition to other characteristics of plasticity, this is also confirmed by the unfavourable relation between the lower plasticity limit and the field water capacity (0. 8 - 0. 9). Further more, by the low values of the consistence index (lower than 0. 25 and 0. 25 - 0. 50) with the corresponding liquid state or very soft plasticity in the course of spring (Table 2). 2. In the described conditions to soil consistence, mechanical tillage is practically unfeasible. This is also the main reason for the delayed seedbed preparation and sowing of maize in spring on most arable areas of ahe Farm. 3. Other physical properties of these soils are also unfavourable due to greater changes in the volume, depending on the moisture dynamics in the soil. They are characterised by high values of the coefficient of linear extensibility (0. 12 - 0. 22) and swelling (N...|$|E
40|$|Most {{recent studies}} on soil water {{repellency}} (WR) {{were limited to}} the <b>humous</b> topsoil or to shallow subsoil layers slightly below the main root zone to approximately 0. 5 m depth. Hence, the main objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate the wettability pattern of a forest soil including the deeper subsoil. The selected site was a 100 years old beech forest on a well-drained sandy Cambisol in northern Germany which showed moderate to partly extended acidification. Results obtained from three sampling transects (3 m length, 2 m depth; sampling grid 8 × 8 samples per transect; minimum distance of sampling locations to nearest tree about 0. 5 m) show that contact angles (CA) were always in the subcritical WR range (0 ° < CA < 90 °). Significant impact of the tree distance on WR was not observed for any of the transects. A prominent feature of two transects was the minimum WR level (CA < 10 °) for samples with soil organic carbon (SOC) contents around 0. 25 – 0. 4 %. For the topsoils it was observed that CA increased with SOC content from that minimum to a maximum CA of 60 – 75 ° for transects 1 and 2 with mean pH values < 3. 5. For transect 3 with slightly higher average pH close to 4. 0, average CA of samples were always < 10 ° and showed no trend to increase with increasing SOC content or other soil parameters like N content or C/N ratio. Subsoil samples, however, behave differently with respect to SOC: for these samples, generally low in SOC, the CA increase with decreasing SOC occurred at all transects for approximately 50 % of the samples but did not show any clear tendencies with respect to further parameters like texture, pH or N content. We conclude that the SOC content is the most prominent parameter determining wettability, either positively correlated with WR for topsoils or negatively correlated for subsoil samples very low in SOC. We finally conclude for moderately acid beech forest stands that emerging WR starts in the A horizon after reaching a pH lower than 3. 5, whereas subsoil WR might appear already at higher pH values. Even SOC contents of ~ 0. 01 – 0. 02 % turned out to be very effective in increasing the CA up to 70 °, which points out clearly the importance of small amounts of soil organic matter in affecting subsoil wettability. With respect to site hydrology we conclude that ongoing acidification as well as predicted higher frequencies of extended droughts due to climate change will promote the occurrence of WR with corresponding implications for site and catchment hydrology.

40|$|The {{largest and}} the most {{coherent}} complexes of natural spruce stands in Croatia are currently distributed in the altimontane and subalpine vegetation belt of Velebit over an area of 3165 ha and altitudes ranging from 1100 to almost 1600 m. Past phytocoenological research into spruce forests in northern Velebit distinguishes three different associations: frost valleys of Štirovača and Apatišanska Duliba support the altimontane spruce forest with bastard agrimony (Aremonio-Piceetum Horvat 1938), shallower sink holes and slopes descending from the surrounding tops contain the altimontane-subalpine spruce forest with Laserpitium krapfii (Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum Vukelić et al. 2010), while rocky tops, hips, karrens and ridges feature the subalpine spruce forest with small-reed (Calamagrostio variae-Piceetum Bertović 1975). These associations are distributed as azonal, microclimatically and edaphically conditioned associations, of which spruce forest with bastard agrimony occurs in the belt of Dinaric beech-fir forest (Omphalodo-Fagetum) while the two others grow in a higher belt of subalpine beech forest with buttercup (Ranunculo platanifoliae-Fagetum). Their mutual differences result from ecological factors which are decisive for their occurrence and distribution. Of these, the edaphic relationships which we explored in this work draw particular interest. Composite samples {{were taken from the}} top layer up to 5 cm deep (13 composite samples composed of 9 individual samples each), pedological profiles were opened (11 profiles), and soil samples were taken by pedogenetic horizons within pedological research in three spruce communities: altimontane spruce forest with bastard agrimony (Aremonio-Piceetum), altimontane-subalpine spruce forest with Laserpitium krapfii (Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum), and subalpine spruce forest with small-reed (Calamagrostio-Piceetum) in the area of northern Velebit and Štirovača. Composite samples, taken from the top soil layer up to 5 cm deep, consisted of 9 samples, each taken at a distance of 1 m in a cross pattern. Soil samples were analyzed by means of the following laboratory methods: determination of pH values (HRN ISO 10390 : 2005), determination of CaCO 3 content (HRN ISO 10693 : 2004), determination of organic and total carbon and nitrogen with dry combustion (HRN ISO 10694 : 2004, HRN ISO 13878 : 2004), determination of concentrations of Pb, Zn, Cu and Cd (HRN ISO 11466 : 2004), and determination of the granulometric soil composition (HRN ISO 11277 : 2004). Descriptive statistics were made for all the samples by the investigated phytocoenosis. Variance analysis was used to test the differences between the composite soil samples for the layer of up to 5 cm in depth. Statistica 7. 0 software was used for this purpose. The analyses of composite soil samples taken from a depth of 5 cm in three different spruce communities (Aremonio-Piceetum, Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum and Calamagrostio-Piceetum) showed than the lowest pH value was recorded in the community Aremonio-Piceetum, followed by the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum, while the highest value was recorded in the community Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum. The average pH (H 2 O) value in the community Aremonio-Piceetum reaches 4. 35, in Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum it is 5. 56 and in Calamagrostio-Piceetum it is 5. 23. In terms of pH values for soil depths of up to 5 cm, the communities Aremonio-Piceetum and Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum (pH H 2 O, p= 0. 01447; pH CaCl 2, p= 0. 01668) show a statistically significant difference. In all the communities the surface soil layer is richly <b>humous</b> and well supplied with nitrogen. It is the richest in the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum, where the average value of C org amounts to 131. 6 g kg– 1 and N tot. to 9. 3 g kg– 1 (Table 3). The C : N ratio in all the three communities is favourable and ranges between 11 and 15. The average depth of the humus-accumulative horizon amounting to 6. 5 cm is the lowest in the community Aremonio-Piceetum. It is higher in the community Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum where it reaches 7. 5 cm and the highest in the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum, where it is 21 cm. The content of pH values, C org., N tot. in the hummus-accumulative horizon shows similar values and an identical trend to composite soil samples at a depth of up to 5 cm. In terms of the argyle-accumulative and cambic horizon, the lowest pH value is observed in the community Aremonio-Piceetum, where the average pH (H 2 O) value is 5. 30. In the community Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum, the average pH (H 2 O) value is 6. 92. The highest pH value is observed in the community Calamagrostio-Piceetum, where the average pH (H 2 O) value reaches 7. 21, but it is only one profile opened in the shallow and distinctly skeletal calcocambisol. All the soils have a texture ranging from silty to clayey loam. Soil reaction was the only parameter to show statistically significant differences for the top soil layer. These differences relate to the communities Aremonio-Piceetum and Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum. The lowest pH value in the community Aremonio-Piceetum is conditioned by acid parent material, flat relief which additionally favours the podzolization process in the perhumid climate, while specific microclimatic conditions, frost sites and high air humidity cause more intensive accumulations of raw humus. In relation to the pH reaction, the lowest acidity is displayed by the association Laserpitio krapfii-Piceetum, as confirmed by phytocoenological research (Vukelić et al. 2010), according to which this community, compared to others, has the biggest number of species of the order Fagetalia. These species are dominant in adjacent, mainly neutrophilic beech and beech-fir forests.
