5|$|The present {{structure}} has many traces of great antiquity, being large and {{built in the}} form of a cross, with a door of early Gothic architecture. The building was probably erected some time after the Norman Conquest, as the plain pointed arch prevails throughout; exactly when we cannot be sure, though possibly after 1246. The earliest visible stonework is thirteenth century, in the tower and the arches supporting it. The external appearance of the church is large and ancient, being erected of rubble stone, with ashlar quoins and windows. The severe appearance and thick walls of the nave suggest Norman architecture, however the presence of pointed lancet windows indicate that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>early</b> Gothic, perhaps from early thirteenth century. Internally the church is {{in the form of}} an aisleless cruciform church with substantial transepts. It was rebuilt (or built afresh) in the thirteenth century after a fire, and the chancel extended in the fifteenth century, after which the structure was largely complete as it is seen today.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{learned about}} {{exposure}} to high level radiation {{from studies of}} the effects of bombing populations at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, it is difficult to trace the relationship of low level radiation exposure to resulting cancers and mutations. This is because the latency period between exposure and effect can be 25years or more for cancer and a generation or more for genetic damage. Since nuclear generating plants have a brief history, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>early</b> to judge the effects.|$|E

500|$|Ultra-light carbon {{nanotubes}} meshed through molecular manufacturing {{techniques have}} densities between 1.3 g/m2 to 1.4 g/m2. By {{the time a}} civilization is ready to use this technology, the carbon nanotube's manufacturing might be optimised {{enough for them to}} have a density lower than the necessary 0.7 g/m2, and the average sail density with rigging might be kept to 0.3 g/m2 (a [...] "spin stabilized" [...] light sail requires minimal additional mass in rigging). If such a sail could be constructed at this areal density, a space habitat the size of the L5 Society's proposed O'Neill cylinder—500km2, with room for over 1 million inhabitants, massing 3 tons—could be supported by a circular light sail 3,000km in diameter, with a combined sail/habitat mass of 5.4 kg. For comparison, this is just slightly smaller than the diameter of Jupiter's moon Europa (although the sail is a flat disc, not a sphere), or the distance between San Francisco and Kansas City. Such a structure would, however, have a mass quite a lot less than many asteroids. Although the construction of such a massive inhabitable statite would be a gigantic undertaking, and the required material science behind <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>early</b> stage, there are other engineering feats and required materials proposed in other Dyson sphere variants.|$|E
500|$|In Morning, a lady {{makes her}} way to church, {{shielding}} herself with her fan from the shocking view of two men pawing at the market girls. The scene is {{the west side of}} the piazza at Covent Garden, indicated by a part of the Palladian portico of Inigo Jones's Church of St Paul visible behind Tom King's Coffee House, a notorious venue celebrated in pamphlets of the time. Henry Fielding mentions the coffee house in both The Covent Garden Tragedy and Pasquin. At the time Hogarth produced this picture, the coffee house was being run by Tom's widow, Moll King, but its reputation had not diminished. Moll opened the doors once those of the taverns had shut, allowing the revellers to continue enjoying themselves from midnight until dawn. The Mansion House with columned portico visible in the centre of the picture, No. 43 King Street, is attributed to architect Thomas Archer (later 1st Baron Archer) and occupied by him at the date of Hogarth's works. It was situated on the north side of the piazza, while the coffee house was on the south side, as depicted in Hogarth's original painting. In the picture, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>early</b> morning and some revellers are ending their evening: a fight has broken out in the coffee house and, in the melée, a wig flies out of the door. [...] Meanwhile, stallholders set out their fruit and vegetables for the day's market. Two children who should be making their way to school have stopped, entranced by the activity of the market, in a direct reference to Swift's A Description of the Morning in which children [...] "lag with satchels in their hands". Above the clock is Father Time and below it the inscription Sic transit gloria mundi. The smoke rising from the chimney of the coffee house connects these portents to the scene below.|$|E
2500|$|Brighton College is {{the only}} {{surviving}} building in the city by George Gilbert Scott: his Brill's Baths have been demolished. [...] Many additions {{have been made to}} his 14th-century Gothic-style flint and Caen stone complex, on which work started in 1848. [...] The design has been criticised by Harry Stuart Goodhart-Rendel and Nikolaus Pevsner, who called the ensemble [...] "joyless" [...] and preferred T.G. Jackson's [...] "lavishly Gothic" [...] additions of 1886–87, in which terracotta was used extensively. BHASVIC is a [...] "splendid" [...] former grammar school on Old Shoreham Road in Prestonville. [...] Designed by S.B. Russell in 1911–12, in a Neo-Georgian/Queen Anne style with extensive red brickwork and wings joined to a central section by a series of staircases lit by round windows), it occupies a prominent corner site and retains its original iron gates with the emblems of Hove and Brighton Boroughs and East and West Sussex. The Municipal Technical College on Richmond Terrace, north of Grand Parade (now flats) was designed in 1895–96 by the Brighton Borough Surveyor Francis May. [...] Extensions of 1909 and 1935 were in a complementary style with brick and dark terracotta, and the whole complex has been described as [...] "Free Jacobean" [...] in style. Roedean School (1898–99), a girls' boarding school high on the cliffs towards Ovingdean, is a Free Jacobean composition by John William Simpson. [...] From the centre of the symmetrical range rise two identical towers. [...] Several wings then project forwards from this central block, each with a large gable end. [...] Simpson also designed the chapel in 1906, a sanatorium in 1908 and a library in 1911. [...] Hubert Worthington worked on a dining room extension in the 1960s. St Mary's Hall, a private school affiliated to Roedean but closed since 2011, has a symmetrical façade with prominent gables and mullioned windows. [...] The design resembles simplified Tudor Revival, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>early</b> for that style (George Basevi designed it in 1836).|$|E
