40|$|The {{effects of}} cage size and an {{obstructed}} {{view from the}} cage {{on the use of}} wooden nonwalled resting platforms by juvenile male (n= 10) and female (n= 15) silver foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were assessed in a 10 week experiment. The degree of the view and the <b>free</b> <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> of the cage varied between the five types of cage used. Each animal spent 2 weeks in each type of cage and their behaviour was videorecorded for a 24 -h period in each 2 -week period. The foxes spent 59 ± 13 % of their daily time on the platforms. Use declined from 72 ± 13 % in September to 35 ± 21 % in November. Males used the platforms more than did females. In late October and early November, the foxes in cages with an obstructed view from the floor made more use of the platforms for both active behaviour and resting than did those in cages with an unobstructed view from the floor. The larger the <b>free</b> <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> of the cage, the less the silver foxes used the platforms during activity in mid-August and mid-September. One probable function of the platform is to offer the foxes an observation and resting place with an open view in all directions. ...|$|E

Although the sample was not {{large enough to be}} representative of all families with teen-age children in the city of Lincoln, Nebraska, it was thought to be adequate to determine if the techniques used were satisfactory, and the findings would warrant a larger study. Thus, the present study might be considered a pilot study for further research. The objectives are: To summarize what is known about the space and equipment for family recreational or leisure time activities. To determine what recreational or leisure activities are carried on by families with teen-age children. To evaluate the present space and equipment available for carrying on these activities. To plan and develop an arrangement of equipment, storage space, and <b>free</b> <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> for leisure activities that will provide the most satisfactory solution for families with teen-age children. The writer recommends: Creating three distinct activity areas. Using these interchangeably depending upon the demands of various family members. Scheduling certain activities involving a part of the family but excluding others on basis of time where separation in space is not feasible because of equipment involved. Developing space within the three activity areas to allow for more than one use through: the arrangement of furniture into groups according to use. the construction of storage units according to need.

40|$|The {{full height}} truss frame (FHTF) is an {{exciting}} new residential framing system {{in response to the}} need for low floor-to-floor steel construction. The FHTF has the potential to provide low floor-to-floor heights, a column <b>free</b> first <b>floor</b> <b>area,</b> an integrated frame that uses the entire height to resist loads, and the capacity to resist both gravity and lateral loads. Because of its configuration, the full structural height can be used to resist loads. A FHTF is made up of stacked floor trusses that result in one full height truss spanning the entire width of the building. The FHTF is constructed in a conventional manner one floor at a time. The strength, inertia, and truss height will increase as each floor is added. Therefore, the construction sequence will affect the final stresses in the members. The purpose of this thesis was to analyze and design two prototype FHTFs, to compare the economy of the prototypes with similar staggered truss frames, and to develop an approximate method to calculate staged member stresses. Each prototype was analyzed using a computer program and designed according to the 2001 American Institute of Steel Construction Load and Resistance Factor Design. The prototypes were used to assess the strength and serviceability of the structures, and the results of the staged analysis were used to validate the numerical method developed to approximate a staged loading sequence based on the non-staged dead load results. The results of the analysis and design of the prototypes was the initial step in confirming the viability of the FHTF for use in the residential multistory market. FHTFs can be designed with preexisting procedure, and are capable of offering low floor-to-floor heights. The prototypes exhibited excellent lateral stiffness against wind loads. The numerical method for estimating the staged dead load accurately approximated the results of the analysis preformed by ETABS. The numerical method can be used to simulate a variety of sequences in order to optimize the stages. Lastly, the FHTF was shown to be competitive with the staggered truss systems in terms of material usage, fabrication, and construction. M. S.

40|$|When the {{external}} measurements {{of a building}} are fixed, an increase in external wall thickness caused by additional insulation, for example, will lead to loss of saleable <b>floor</b> <b>area.</b> This issue {{has to be taken}} into account in the evaluation of investment profitability. This paper examines how technologies used in energy-efficient residential building construction affect the available saleable <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> and how this impacts profitability of investment. Using a modeled building and an analysis of the average construction cost, we assessed losses and gains of saleable <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> in energy-efficient buildings. The analysis shows that the impact of potential losses or gains of saleable <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> should be taken into account when comparing investment alternatives: building energy-efficient green dwellings or building conventional ones. The results indicate that constructing energy-efficient buildings and introducing very energy-efficient technologies may be energy- and cost-effective even compared with conventional buildings.
