5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} may {{be diagnosed}} when {{the combination of}} <b>hyperglycemia</b> (high blood sugars), ketones in the blood or on urinalysis and acidosis are demonstrated. In about 10% of cases the blood sugar is not significantly elevated ("euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis").|$|E
5|$|Anti-inflammatory {{drugs are}} often used to control the effects of inflammation. Glucocorticoids are the most {{powerful}} of these drugs; however, these drugs can have many undesirable side effects, such as central obesity, <b>hyperglycemia,</b> osteoporosis, and their use must be tightly controlled. Lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs {{are often used}} in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine.|$|E
5|$|There is also modest {{evidence}} that genetic factors influence the prognosis in SAH. For example, having {{two copies of}} ApoE4 (a variant of the gene encoding apolipoprotein E that also {{plays a role in}} Alzheimer's disease) seems to increase risk for delayed ischemia and a worse outcome. The occurrence of <b>hyperglycemia</b> (high blood sugars) after an episode of SAH confers a higher risk of poor outcome.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} {{there may be}} an {{asymptomatic}} phase following the initial symptoms which is then followed by more significant toxicity including kidney damage, liver damage, and neurological dysfunction including seizures and coma. These signs usually develop within 1–3days in serious cases. The patient develops jaundice and the liver and spleen become enlarged, in some cases blood sugar levels will rise (<b>hyperglycemia)</b> and then fall (hypoglycemia) and liver toxicity is seen. Additionally intravascular hemolysis causes destruction of red blood cells resulting in increase in free hemoglobin and hemoglobinuria which can lead to renal toxicity or renal failure. Methemoglobinemia may also occur in some cases. This is where higher than normal levels of methemoglobin, which is a form of hemoglobin that can not carry oxygen, are found in the blood. It causes the patient to become short of breath and cyanotic. Cases of severe poisoning may progress to a terminal neurological phase, with delirium, muscle fasciculations and seizures, and mydriasis progressing to coma, circulatory collapse, and respiratory arrest. Death may occur from five to seven days after consumption.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum {{has a low}} to {{moderate}} level of toxicity and should be handled with care. The injection of lanthanum solutions produces <b>hyperglycemia,</b> low blood pressure, degeneration of the spleen and hepatic alterations. The application in carbon arc light led to the exposure of people to rare earth element oxides and fluorides, which sometimes led to pneumoconiosis. As the La3+ ion is similar in size to the Ca2+ ion, it is sometimes used as an easily traced substitute for the latter in medical studies. Lanthanum, like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. When injected into the brain, it acts as a painkiller, similarly to morphine and other opiates, though the mechanism behind this is still unknown.|$|E
25|$|Dehydration {{can change}} the way {{subcutaneous}} insulin is absorbed, so either <b>hyperglycemia</b> or hypoglycemia are possible; dehydration can also cause false negative or positive urine ketone test results. <b>Hyperglycemia</b> means more of a risk for dehydration.|$|E
25|$|POIS {{could also}} be caused by <b>hyperglycemia</b> or by {{chemical}} imbalances in the brain.|$|E
25|$|Some {{forms of}} MODY produce {{significant}} <b>hyperglycemia</b> and the typical signs and : increased thirst and urination (polydipsia and polyuria).|$|E
25|$|Mild to {{moderate}} <b>hyperglycemia</b> (typically 130–250nbsp&mg/dl, or 7–14nbsp&mmol/l) discovered before 30 years of age. However, anyone under 50 can develop MODY.|$|E
25|$|High {{blood levels}} of {{cortisol}} during critical illness could theoretically be protective because of several reasons. They modulate metabolism (for example, by inducing high blood sugar levels, thereby providing energy to the body). They also suppress excessive immune system activation and exert supporting effects on the circulatory system. Increased susceptibility to infections, <b>hyperglycemia</b> (in patients already prone to stress <b>hyperglycemia),</b> gastrointestinal bleeding, electrolyte disturbances and steroid-induced myopathy (in patients already prone to critical illness polyneuropathy) are possible harmful effects.|$|E
25|$|Oral use of {{cortisone}} has {{a number}} of potential systemic side-effects: <b>hyperglycemia,</b> insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, anxiety, depression, amenorrhoea, cataracts, Cushing's syndrome and glaucoma, among other problems.|$|E
25|$|When {{blood glucose}} levels are high, glucose {{molecules}} {{attach to the}} hemoglobin in red blood cells. The longer <b>hyperglycemia</b> occurs in blood, the more glucose binds to hemoglobin in the red blood cells and the higher the glycated hemoglobin.|$|E
25|$|Around 200 {{mutations}} of {{the human}} glucokinase gene GCK have been discovered, that can change the efficiency of glucose binding and phosphorylation, increasing or decreasing the sensitivity of beta cell insulin secretion in response to glucose, and producing clinically significant <b>hyperglycemia</b> or hypoglycemia.|$|E
25|$|Mifepristone is {{used for}} the medical {{treatment}} of high blood sugar (<b>hyperglycemia)</b> caused by high cortisol levels in the blood (hypercortisolism) in adults with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or cannot have surgery.|$|E
25|$|The term MODY {{dates back}} to 1964, when {{diabetes}} mellitus was considered to have two main forms: juvenile-onset and maturity-onset, which roughly corresponded to {{what we now call}} type 1 and type 2. MODY was originally applied to any child or young adult who had persistent, asymptomatic <b>hyperglycemia</b> without progression to diabetic ketosis or ketoacidosis. In retrospect we can now recognize that this category covered a heterogeneous collection of disorders which included cases of dominantly inherited diabetes (the topic of this article, still called MODY today), as well as cases of what we would now call type 2 diabetes occurring in childhood or adolescence, and a few even rarer types of <b>hyperglycemia</b> (e.g., mitochondrial diabetes or mutant insulin). Many of these patients were treated with sulfonylureas with varying degrees of success.|$|E
25|$|Over 190 {{of these}} {{mutations}} reduce the functional {{efficiency of the}} glucokinase molecule. Heterozygosity for alleles with reduced enzyme activity results in a higher threshold for insulin release and persistent, mild <b>hyperglycemia.</b> This condition {{is referred to as}} maturity onset diabetes of the young, type 2 (MODY2).|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{many people}} with MODY have no signs or {{symptoms}} and are diagnosed either by accident, when a high glucose is discovered during testing for other reasons, or screening of relatives of a person discovered to have diabetes. Discovery of mild <b>hyperglycemia</b> during a routine glucose tolerance test for pregnancy is particularly characteristic.|$|E
25|$|In the {{pancreatic}} beta-cell, glucokinase {{is a key}} regulator enzyme. Glucokinase is {{very important}} in the regulation of insulin secretion and has been known as the pancreatic beta-cell sensor. Mutations in the gene encoding glucokinase can cause both <b>hyperglycemia</b> and hypoglycemia because of its central role in the regulation of insulin release.|$|E
25|$|Ketones in {{the urine}} or blood, as {{detected}} by urine strips or a blood ketone testing meter, may indicate the beginning of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a dangerous and often quickly fatal condition caused by high glucose levels (<b>hyperglycemia)</b> and low insulin levels combined with certain other systemic stresses. DKA can be arrested if caught quickly.|$|E
25|$|Borax as {{a source}} of borate has been used to take {{advantage}} of the co-complexing ability of borate with other agents in water to form complex ions with various substances. Borate and a suitable polymer bed are used to chromatograph non-glycosylated hemoglobin differentially from glycosylated hemoglobin (chiefly HbA1c), which is an indicator of long term <b>hyperglycemia</b> in diabetes mellitus.|$|E
25|$|Mifepristone 300mg tablets (Korlym) have a {{marketing}} authorization in the United States from the FDA {{for the medical}} treatment of high blood sugar (<b>hyperglycemia)</b> caused by high cortisol levels in the blood (hypercortisolism) in adults with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or cannot have surgery.|$|E
25|$|Clozapine {{may cause}} side effects. Some are serious and {{potentially}} fatal. Common side effects include constipation, bed-wetting, night-time drooling, muscle stiffness, sedation, tremors, orthostatic hypotension, <b>hyperglycemia,</b> and weight gain. The {{risk of developing}} extrapyramidal symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia is below that of typical antipsychotics; {{this may be due}} to clozapine's anticholinergic effects. Extrapyramidal symptoms may subside somewhat after a person switches from another antipsychotic to clozapine.|$|E
25|$|Due to glycated hemoglobin's {{variability}} (as {{shown in}} the table above), additional measures should be checked in patients at or near recommended goals. People with HbA1c values at 64mmol/mol or less should be provided additional testing {{to determine whether the}} HbA1c values are due to averaging out high blood glucose (<b>hyperglycemia)</b> with low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) or the HbA1c is more reflective of an elevated blood glucose that does not vary much throughout the day. Devices such as continuous blood glucose monitoring allow people with diabetes to determine their blood glucose levels on a continuous basis, testing every few minutes. Continuous use of blood glucose monitors is becoming more common, and the devices are covered by many health insurance plans but not by Medicare in the United States. The supplies tend to be expensive, since the sensors must be changed at least weekly. Another test that is useful in determining if HbA1c values are due to wide variations of blood glucose throughout the day is 1,5 Anhydroglucitol, also known as GlycoMark. GlycoMark reflects only the times that the person experiences <b>hyperglycemia</b> above 180mg/dL over a two-week period.|$|E
25|$|While insulin {{replacement}} is appreciated as a life saving therapy, its {{practical use}} in controlling blood glucose levels sufficiently {{to avoid the}} long-term complications associated with <b>hyperglycemia</b> is not ideal. Also, it is generally agreed that even with very tight glucose control, there are {{a significant number of}} patients who go on to develop all of the life impacting complications of diabetes. Thus, the goal of the Artificial Pancreas should be to normalize carbohydrate and lipid metabolism at a minimum.|$|E
25|$|Sucrose can {{contribute}} to the development of metabolic syndrome. In an experiment with rats that were fed a diet one-third of which was sucrose, the sucrose first elevated blood levels of triglycerides, which induced visceral fat and ultimately resulted in insulin resistance. Another study found that rats fed sucrose-rich diets developed high triglycerides, <b>hyperglycemia,</b> and insulin resistance. A 2004 study recommended that the consumption of sucrose-containing drinks should be limited due to the growing number of people with obesity and insulin resistance.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>hyperglycemia,</b> significant weight gain is frequently experienced by patients treated with clozapine. Impaired glucose metabolism and obesity {{have been shown}} to be constituents of the metabolic syndrome and may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. The data suggest that clozapine may be more likely to cause adverse metabolic effects than some of the other atypical antipsychotics. A study has established that olanzapine and clozapine disturb the metabolism by making the body take preferentially its energy from fat (instead of privileging carbohydrates). Levels of carbohydrates remaining high, the body develops insulin resistance (causing diabetes).|$|E
25|$|Aldose reductase is {{the first}} enzyme in the sorbitol-aldose reductase pathway {{responsible}} for the reduction of glucose to sorbitol, {{as well as the}} reduction of galactose to galactitol. Too much sorbitol trapped in retinal cells, the cells of the lens, and the Schwann cells that myelinate peripheral nerves, is a frequent result of long-term <b>hyperglycemia</b> that accompanies poorly controlled diabetes. This can damage these cells, leading to retinopathy, cataracts and peripheral neuropathy, respectively. Aldose reductase inhibitors, which are substances that prevent or slow the action of aldose reductase, are currently being investigated as a way to prevent or delay these complications.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of mild {{hypothermia}} may be vague, with sympathetic {{nervous system}} excitation (shivering, high blood pressure, fast heart rate, fast respiratory rate, and contraction of blood vessels). These are all physiological responses to preserve heat. Increased urine production due to cold, mental confusion, and hepatic dysfunction may also be present. <b>Hyperglycemia</b> may be present, as glucose consumption by cells and insulin secretion both decrease, and tissue sensitivity to insulin may be blunted. Sympathetic activation also releases glucose from the liver. In many cases, however, especially in alcoholic patients, hypoglycemia {{appears to be a}} more common presentation. Hypoglycemia is also found in many hypothermic patients, because hypothermia may be a result of hypoglycemia.|$|E
25|$|Precautions {{should be}} taken in {{patients}} with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics along with other medications that affect blood sugar levels and should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. The liquid form (oral solution) of this medication may contain up to 15 grams of sugar per dose. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing {{at the beginning of}} treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of <b>hyperglycemia</b> including polydipsia (excessive thirst), polyuria (excessive urination), polyphagia (increased appetite), and weakness.|$|E
25|$|In those {{patients}} not suited for {{or unwilling to}} undergo surgery, several drugs {{have been found to}} inhibit cortisol synthesis (e.g. ketoconazole, metyrapone) but they are of limited efficacy. Mifepristone is a powerful glucocorticoid type II receptor antagonist and, since it does not interfere with normal cortisol homeostatis type I receptor transmission, may be especially useful for treating the cognitive effects of Cushing's syndrome. However, the medication faces considerable controversy due to its use as an abortifacient. In February 2012, the FDA approved mifepristone to control high blood sugar levels (<b>hyperglycemia)</b> in adult patients who are not candidates for surgery, or who did not respond to prior surgery, with the warning that mifepristone should never be used by pregnant women.|$|E
25|$|Exercise is a {{particularly}} potent tool for glucose control in those who have diabetes mellitus. In a situation of elevated blood glucose (<b>hyperglycemia),</b> moderate exercise can induce greater glucose disposal than appearance, thereby decreasing total plasma glucose concentrations. As stated above, the mechanism for this glucose disposal is independent of insulin, which makes it particularly well-suited for people with diabetes. In addition, {{there appears to be}} an increase in sensitivity to insulin for approximately 12–24 hours post-exercise. This is particularly useful for those who have type II diabetes and are producing sufficient insulin but demonstrate peripheral resistance to insulin signaling. However, during extreme hyperglycemic episodes, people with diabetes should avoid exercise due to potential complications associated with ketoacidosis. Exercise could exacerbate ketoacidosis by increasing ketone synthesis in response to increased circulating NEFA's.|$|E
25|$|Nonketotic hyperosmolar {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome) {{is a rare}} but extremely serious complication of untreated canine diabetes, which is a medical emergency. It shares the symptoms of extreme <b>hyperglycemia,</b> dehydration, and lethargy with ketoacidosis; because there is some insulin in the system, the body does not begin to turn to using fat as its energy source {{and there is no}} ketone production. There is not sufficient insulin available to the body for proper uptake of glucose, but there is enough to prevent ketone formation. The problem of dehydration in NHS is more profound than in diabetic ketoacidosis. Seizures and coma are possible. Treatment {{is similar to that of}} ketoacidosis, with the exceptions being that NHS requires that the blood glucose levels and rehydration be normalized at a slower rate than for DKA; cerebral edema is possible if the treatment progresses too rapidly.|$|E
25|$|Since the glucose that {{normally}} enters the cells {{is unable to}} do so without insulin, it begins to build up in the blood where it can be seen as <b>hyperglycemia</b> or high blood glucose levels. The tubules of the kidneys are normally able to re-absorb glucose, but they are unable to handle and process the amount of glucose they are being presented with. At this point, which is called the renal threshold, the excess glucose spills into the urine (glycosuria), where it can be seen in urine glucose testing. It is the polyuria, or over-frequent urination, which causes polydipsia, or excessive water consumption, through an osmotic process. Even though there is an overabundance of glucose, the lack of insulin does not allow it to enter the cells. As a result, they are not able to receive nourishment from their normal glucose source. The body begins using fat for this purpose, causing weight loss; the process {{is similar to that of}} starvation.|$|E
25|$|Paroxysmal kinesigenic choreathetosis (PKC) {{also called}} {{paroxysmal}} kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by attacks of involuntary movements, which are triggered by sudden voluntary movements. The number of attacks can increase during puberty and decrease in a person's 20s to 30s. Involuntary movements {{can take many}} forms such as ballism, chorea or dystonia and usually only affect {{one side of the}} body or one limb in particular. This rare disorder only affects about 1 in 150,000 people with PKD accounting for 86.8% of all the types of paroxysmal dyskinesias and occurs more often in males than females. There are two types of PKD, primary and secondary. Primary PKD can be further broken down into familial and sporadic. Familial PKD, which means the individual has a family history of the disorder, is more common, but sporadic cases are also seen. Secondary PKD can be caused by many other medical conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, pseudohypoparathyroidism, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, <b>hyperglycemia,</b> central nervous system trauma, or peripheral nervous system trauma. PKD has also been linked with infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis (ICCA) syndrome, in which patients have afebrile seizures during infancy (benign familial infantile epilepsy) and then develop paroxysmal choreoathetosis later in life. This phenomenon is actually quite common, with about 42% of individuals with PKD reporting a history of afebrile seizures as a child.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{metabolic}} {{concerns have}} been of grave concern to clinicians, patients and the FDA. In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required all manufacturers of atypical antipsychotics to change their labeling to include a warning {{about the risks of}} <b>hyperglycemia</b> and diabetes with atypical antipsychotics. It must also be pointed out that although all atypicals must carry the warning on their labeling, some evidence shows that atypicals are not equal in their effects on weight and insulin sensitivity. The general consensus is that clozapine and olanzapine are associated with the greatest effects on weight gain and decreased insulin sensitivity, followed by risperidone and quetiapine. Ziprasidone and aripiprazole are thought to have the smallest effects on weight and insulin resistance, but clinical experience with these newer agents is not as developed as that with the older agents. The mechanism of these adverse effects is not completely understood but it is believed to result from a complex interaction between a number of pharmacologic actions of these drugs. Their effects on weight are believed to mostly derive from their actions on the H1 and 5-HT2C receptors, while their effects on insulin sensitivity are believed {{to be the result of}} a combination of their effects on body weight (as increased body mass is known to be a risk factor for insulin resistance) and their antagonistic effects on the M3receptor. Some of the newer agents, however, such as risperidone and its metabolite paliperidone, ziprasidone, lurasidone, aripiprazole, asenapine and iloperidone have clinically-insignificant effects on the M3 receptor and appear to carry a lower risk of insulin resistance. Whereas clozapine, olanzapine and quetiapine (indirectly via its active metabolite, norquetiapine) all antagonise the M3 receptor at therapeutic-relevant concentrations.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} {{symptoms}} following overdose include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, tachycardia, drowsiness, and, rarely, hypoglycemia or <b>hyperglycemia.</b> [...] Treatment of metformin overdose is generally supportive, as no specific antidote is known. Extracorporeal treatments are recommended in severe overdoses. Due to metformin's {{low molecular weight}} and lack of plasma protein binding, these techniques {{have the benefit of}} removing metformin from blood plasma, preventing further lactate overproduction.|$|E
