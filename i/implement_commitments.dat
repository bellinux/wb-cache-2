40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an update on}} the latest status of the WTO negotiations on trade facilitation issues. These negotiations focus on the clarification and improvement of relevant aspects of GATT Articles V, VIII, and X which contain provisions on goods in transit, fees, and formalities for imports and exports, and transparency issues. Capacity building and technical assistance to developing countries have become a major driver of these negotiations. The principle of special and differential treatment (S&D) for developing and least-developed countries embraces a whole new approach. The S&D treatment envisages going beyond the classical granting of transitional periods (being exercised under the current WTO agreements) with the capacity of developing and least-developing countries to <b>implement</b> <b>commitments</b> intertwined with the extent and timing of entering into commitments. Trade facilitation, negotiations, GATT Articles V, VIII, X, customs, WTO negotiation...|$|E

40|$|This report {{discusses}} the negotiations leading the Kyoto {{conference of the}} parties. The United States and other parties to the 1992 Climate Change Convention signed at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro will meet December 1 - 12 in Kyoto, Japan, to conclude year-long negotiations on a legally binding protocol or amendment to reduce or stabilize emissions of greenhouse gas emissions. The U. S. proposal to reduce {{emissions of carbon dioxide}} and five other greenhouse gases to 1990 levels between 2008 - 2012 is less ambitious than environmentalists and many other treaty Parties urge, but represents a commitment that others, including many in business, fear could damage the economy. A key aspect of the negotiations also is what should be expected of developing nations, whose current emissions of greenhouse gases are relatively small, but are expected to increase rapidly over the next decade with economic development. A sense of the Senate resolution calls for all countries to meet scheduled reductions, and would agree to U. S. participation only if harm to the domestic economy is avoided. If agreement is reached in Kyoto, Senate approval would be required for U. S. ratification, and legislation to <b>implement</b> <b>commitments</b> would also likely be necessary...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{argues that}} WTO {{has not been}} {{functioning}} in a transparent manner and {{that the benefits of}} globalisation have not reached all countries. If Seattle is any indication, WTO is in fact 'a rich man's club'. Developed countries have been adopting the strategy of prying open the markets of developing countries while at the same time, erecting barriers that prevent access to markets in their countries to the products emanating from developing countries. In this regard, the paper looks at the 'new issues ' that developed countries are keen to introduce into the WTO agenda through a new round of negotiations and argues that these would act as 'disguised protection'. By themselves, each of these issues represents an area of concern and interest for the developing countries, such as, investment, competition policy, environment, electronic commerce, etc. However, their relationship with trade is complex and this needs to be comprehensively examined in the first instance. The paper argues that it would, therefore, be both premature and inappropriate to agree to the inclusion of these so-called 'new issues' into the WTO agenda and {{that it is important to}} first <b>implement</b> <b>commitments</b> entered into in earlier rounds before taking on board fresh commitments. Much, in other words, could in fact be lost by overloading the WTO agenda. The paper also looks at the issue of labour standards, better known as 'the social clause', which some developed countries are keen to place on the WTO agenda and argues Amit Dasgupta is currently working as Director (Economic, Trade and Transport) in the SAARC Secretaria...|$|E
40|$|The European Employment Strategy is now {{seven years}} old. Whilst its {{contribution}} to improving labour market performance has been evaluated, less {{attention has been paid}} to the manner in which the EES has worked, in particular the ways in which policy has been formulated and implemented. In particular, there has been little investigation of the extent to which one of the stated objectives of the strategy – the improved involvement of the social partners in the formulation and imple-mentation of policy – has been achieved. This paper argues that in many respects this objective has not been met. Even in countries where social partnership structures appear relatively well developed, the Luxembourg process has added little – in part because it is seen to be concerned with technical matters. Employment policy is ‘settled’ elsewhere. In addition, realisation of those elements of the strategy where social partner participation is most critical has often been frustrated by the lack of mechanisms to <b>implement</b> <b>commitments</b> made at the centre at places of work. Moreover, by subscribing to the strategy, social partners were also subscribing to a wider approach to economic policy – an approach that was scarcely compatible with the approach advocated by trade unions. Accordingly, the conclusion has to be that the Luxembourg process failed to develop social partnership. An exception might be the closer working together of the European-level social partner associations. However, their involvement in the strategy has been little noticed by their constituents, and it might even be argued to have encouraged elitism rather than to have promoted greater participation in policy-making...|$|E

This chapter takes a fresh approach to sustainability education and uses epistemological questions to guide the reader's thinking. We argue that decision-making on environmental issues must be based on quality evidence and robust analysis of that evidence. We conclude that while sustainability education has become a highly emotive and politicised area of debate and human activity, there is much that we can do as educators to contribute towards creating a preferred, sustainable future...|$|R
