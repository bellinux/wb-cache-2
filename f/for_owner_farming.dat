The study indicated that most of the farms (46 %) were established within last ten years. Fifteen different fish species were cultured.

Fish farming (58 %) was the major income source <b>for</b> <b>farm</b> <b>owners.</b> Most of the (72 %) farms depend on underground water. Various types of chemicals and toxic substances like rotenone (16 % farm), phostoxin (10 % farm), bleaching powder (6 % farm), disel/kerosin (22 % farm) and sumithion (4 % farm) were used. Among all the farms 32 %, 56 % and 34 % were affected by tail and fin rot, oxygen deficiency and disease, respectively.

40|$|Because of {{increasing}} rural land values, potential estate {{problems have been}} created <b>for</b> <b>farm</b> <b>owners.</b> This {{study was conducted to}} analyze land use changes when the <b>farm</b> <b>owner</b> dies. Land use changes and factors related to use change for estates subjected to probate court during 1971 - 1975, in the selected Utah counties, are described in this thesis. County records were searched for information pertaining to farm estates probaged in six Utah counties. Individuals handling the affairs of the estates were contacted by mail. Questionnaires returned were used in the analysis and are the basis for the conclusions of this study. General conclusions of the study were: 1. Land transferred from agricultural to non-agricultural use most frequently when land was sold by the owner prior to death. Transfer of farm land out of agriculture occurred least often when the <b>farm</b> <b>owner</b> utilized estate planning. 2. Regression analysis of variance was used to determine effects of related factors on disposition of farm land use after the owners death. Purchaser and method of land management were determined to significantly influence estate land use. 3. The marital deduction received considerable attention in the new Federal Estate tax law.

25|$|After the {{admission}} of Missouri as a slave state, the owning and sale of slaves continued in St. Louis, although as the town grew, {{the percentage of the}} population held as slaves declined. The treatment of slaves in St. Louis as compared with other areas is unclear; some evidence suggests mild to harsh treatment, and it is clear that many slaves attempted to escape. Slave sales occurred usually through advertising in newspapers, with transactions conducted in hotels or private homes. Slaves often were held in the St. Louis jail prior to their movement to a particular farm or to a dealer. Many slaves worked on steamboats as crew or as laborers on the riverfront, and some escaped across the river to the free state of Illinois, continuing via the Underground Railroad to Canada.

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{field study}} {{was performed to}} evaluate infection in dogs and cats living on farms with Mycobacterium bovis-infected cattle. The purpose was to determine pet infection status and assess their risk to farm families and/or tuberculosis-free livestock.

Fifty-one biological samples were cultured; all were negative for M. bovis, although other Mycobacterium species were recovered. No radiographic, serological or skin test evidence of mycobacterial infection was found. These negative results {{may be due to}} the low level of M. bovis infection in the cattle and the limited duration of exposure of pets to infected cattle residing on the same farm.

40|$|The Brazilian {{rural areas}} play an {{important}} role in the management of environmental and social issues. In these areas decisions are made which affect the conservation of the remaining natural ecosystems and the social reproduction of farming families. Brazil has the National Rural Registration System (SNCR) linked to a land registry system that aims to give legal certainty <b>for</b> <b>farms</b> <b>owners,</b> ensuring access to public policies, and enabling the planning of the landâs use and occupation and monitoring of environmental legislation. However, this registration system is declaratory and much of the information provided is not confirmed by public institutions. Therefore, this article aims to gather technical information available in the literature about the SNCR to analyze its potential use as an environmental management tool. The declaratory registration system applied was found not to allow registration data to be used for planning and monitoring of social and environmental policies, leading to several scams associated with tax payments, changes of ownership, access to credit in the banking system, and irregular use of public or protected areas. ...|$|R
40|$|With more {{photovoltaic}} (PV) systems {{being integrated}} into distribution networks, power utilities are facing many challenges in both planning and operation. Network operators {{are concerned with}} PV variability and associated necessity of voltage regulation, control coordination, reserve adequacy and dispatch constraints. While to address the obligatory connection agreement, it is vital <b>for</b> PV <b>farm</b> <b>owners</b> to accurately estimate PV variability and then provide the most cost-effective compensation method. In the literature, PV variability of different scales has been investigated over the last 20 years. However, little has focused on output fluctuations of PV systems with long-term and high-resolution recorded data at a low-voltage distribution feeder level where voltage regulation has become a serious issue.

40|$|Recommendations in this {{guideline}} document {{were developed to}} give family <b>farm</b> <b>owners</b> the information necessary {{to reduce the risk}} of illness and injury to children visiting their farm, while at the same time providing an enjoyable and educational experience. They were written specifically <b>for</b> <b>owners</b> of family <b>farms</b> who may operate an agritourism operation in addition to regular farming activities, as well as for farmers who may host a one-time event such as a tour for schools and other youth groups. The guidelines are also appropriate for larger, long-term agritourism attractions. Background and Scope Agritourism can cover a wide range of scenarios including, but not limited to, corn mazes, "pick your own" fruit and vegetable crops, educational tours for school children, farm-based festivals and country markets and stores. Regardless of the reason for children being on the farm it is the responsibility of the <b>farm</b> <b>owner</b> to control hazards that may risk the health and safety of children and other guests The health and safety guidelines in this publication pertain specifically to children. These guidelines are written with the assumption that supervising adults are responsible for the health and safety of children. In 2001 there were more than 26, 000 injuries to children who lived, worked or visited a farm operation. More than 100 children die of agricultural injuries on U. S. farms and ranches annually. By implementing these guidelines, <b>farm</b> <b>owners</b> can reduce the safety and health hazards that harm thousands of children every year. It is the responsibility of <b>farm</b> <b>owners</b> to identify the health and safety hazards on the farm and apply the recommendations to their specific situations. Each farm is different, with its own unique hazards, and therefore there may be hazards present on farms that are not covered in this document. document. It is recommended that <b>farm</b> <b>owners</b> take the key concepts and recommendations from this document and evaluate health and safety hazards on their farm. They should develop a checklist and document the hazards, indicating any actions taken {{to reduce the risk of}} illness or injury.
