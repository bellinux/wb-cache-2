40|$|In this thesis, a {{literature}} review of hybrid solar-fossil fuel power generation is first given {{with an emphasis}} on system integration and evaluation. Hybrid systems are defined as those which use solar energy and fuel simultaneously, thus excluding the viable alternative of solar thermal plants which use fossil fuels as backup. The review is divided into three main sections: performance metrics, the different concentrated solar receiver technologies and their operating conditions, and the different hybridization schemes. In addition, a new linear combination metric for analysis of hybrid systems, which considers trade-off of different metrics at the fleet level, is presented. This metric is also compared to alternative metrics from multi-objective optimization. Some previous work only evaluates the <b>hybrid</b> <b>cycle</b> at a certain point in time, which can be misleading as this evaluation would not take into account certain aspects of <b>hybrid</b> <b>cycle</b> such as fluctuating solar supply. Furthermore, almost all previous work designs the hybrid solar-fossil fuel systems for a certain point in time and then evaluates the performance of the system for an entire year. By not taking into account fluctuating solar supply and selling price of electricity {{in the design of the}} system, the best possible annual performance of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>cycle</b> may not be reached. Second, an analysis of solar reforming as the integration method for the <b>hybrid</b> <b>cycle</b> is presented, in particular steam reforming of methane. Two solar reforming systems are analyzed: one with a parabolic trough and the other with a solar tower. From the analysis, it is determined that parabolic troughs are not suitable for steam reforming due to the relatively low operating temperatures. The tower reformer system is integrated with a standard combined cycle, and the design and operation of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>cycle</b> is optimized for highest work output for a fixed fuel input and solar collector area (essentially optimizing for maximum cycle efficiency). A heuristic two step procedure is used for the optimization due to the limitation of the optimizer which cannot simultaneously optimize both design and operation. From the optimization, it is determined that the tower reforming integration method is a promising integration option in that this type of <b>hybrid</b> <b>cycle</b> yields high incremental solar efficiencies and also satisfies the linear combination metric for efficiency and CO₂ emissions (i. e., the analyzed <b>hybrid</b> <b>cycle</b> has a higher efficiency for a fixed CO₂ emissions compared to a linear combination of solar only and fossil fuel only cycles). by Elysia J.

New generation of desalination processes or plants has to meet the stringent environment discharge requirements and yet the industry remains highly energy efficient and sustainable when producing good potable water. Water sources, either brackish or seawater, have become more contaminated as feed while the demand for desalination capacities increase around the world. One immediate solution for energy efficiency improvement comes from the hybridization of the proven desalination processes to the newer processes of desalination: For example, {{the integration of the}} available thermally-driven to adsorption desalination (AD) cycles where significant thermodynamic synergy can be attained when cycles are combined.

Both the <b>hybrid</b> <b>cycle</b> group (n = 9) and the handcycle group (n = 10) trained twice a week for 16 weeks on the specific cycle. Outcome measures obtained pre and post the programme were: metabolic syndrome components (waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides and insulin resistance), inflammatory status (C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (1) - 6 and - 10), and visceral adiposity (trunk and android fat). Results: For all outcome measures, {{there were no significant differences}} over time between the 2 training groups.

A <b>hybrid</b> power <b>cycle</b> which generates power at an LHV efficiency > 70 % was identified that includes an atmospheric pressure direct carbonate fuel cell, a gas turbine, and a steam cycle. In this cycle, natural gas fuel is mixed with recycled fuel cell anode exhaust, providing water for reforming fuel. The mixed gas then flows to a direct carbonate fuel cell which generates about 70 % of the power. The portion of the anode exhaust which is not recycled is burned and heat transferred through a heat exchanger (HX) to the compressed air from a gas turbine. The heated compressed air is then heated further in the gas turbine burner and expands through the turbine generating 15 % of the power. Half the exhaust from the turbine provides air for the anode exhaust burner. All of the turbine exhaust eventually flows through the fuel cell cathodes providing the O 2 and CO 2 needed in the electrochemical reaction. Exhaust from the cathodes flows to a steam system (heat recovery steam generator, staged steam turbine generating 15 % of the cycle power).

40|$|In {{the light}} of global warming, the {{associated}} socio economical consequences, and the projected shortage of natural energy resources and ever rising oil prices, this thesis examines the potential for unconventional aero engine architectures {{to reduce fuel consumption}} of passenger aircraft. Current aircraft engines are based on the Brayton cycle, where the working fluid successively experiences isentropic compression, isobaric combustion, and isentropic expansion. Deviations from the ideal cycle in real engines occur through component inefficiencies. The maximum achievable thermodynamic efficiency of the Brayton cycle increases hand in hand with its peak cycle temperature. Since the peak cycle temperature is limited by material properties of the turbine, the maximum cycle efficiency of current jet engines is limited by the laws of thermodynamics. Hence, efficiency improvements of jet engines beyond what is possible with conventional turbofan designs are only feasible through unconventional engine architecture. Several technologies enabling unconventional engine architectures for aircraft propulsion have been identified. They include wave rotor, pulse detonation and internal combustion. These technologies are merged with conventional jet engine technology to form hybrid designs. A one dimensional engine performance model was developed to calculate the performance and allow a comparison of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>cycles</b> with a conventional turbofan cycle. Gradient optimisation techniques were applied to the allow comparison of the best possible designs. Results suggest that of the examined <b>cycles,</b> the <b>hybrid</b> internal combustion <b>cycle</b> has the best potential for fuel savings compared to conventional turbofan cycles.
