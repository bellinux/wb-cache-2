5|$|Since archaeoastronomers {{disagree}} {{so widely}} on {{the characterization of}} the <b>discipline,</b> they even dispute its name.

Michael Hoskin sees {{an important part of the}} <b>discipline</b> as fact-collecting, rather than theorizing, and proposed to label this aspect of the <b>discipline</b> Archaeotopography. Ruggles and Saunders proposed Cultural Astronomy as a unifying term for the various methods of studying folk astronomies. Others have argued that astronomy is an inaccurate term, what are being studied are cosmologies and people who object to the use of logos have suggested adopting the Spanish cosmovisión.|$|E
