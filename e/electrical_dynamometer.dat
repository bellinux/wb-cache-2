In the current work three sets of LNT catalysts were prepared by dipping them in three independent solutions containing i) Barium nitrate, ii) Copper nitrate + Silver nitrate, iii) Copper nitrate + Ferric nitrate + Barium nitrate. These three catalysts were then tested in dual-cylinder four-stroke Simpson 217 DI Diesel engine coupled to <b>electrical</b> <b>dynamometer</b> with wire wound resistance loading device. LNT process was studied and performance of the various chemicals used to reduce the NOx emission under various load conditions in lean burn engine was evaluated. 60 % NOx conversion was obtained for LNT catalyst coated with barium + copper +ferric nitrate...|$|E
40|$|Biodiesel is a {{renewable}} {{and environmental}} friendly alternative fuel {{which can be}} used as a substitute for diesel in compression engine without any modifications. Biodiesel can be prepared from vegetable oils and animal fats. This paper presents the experimental results of rice bran oil methyl ester (biodiesel) as fuel in a single cylinder, direct injection, water cooled diesel engine. The performance was measured using <b>electrical</b> <b>dynamometer.</b> The brake thermal efficiency, specific energy consumption, exhaust gas temperature, cylinder pressure, carbon monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbon (UBHC) and smoke emissions of the rice bran methyl ester were measured and compared with diesel. According to emission tests, as a result of rice bran methyl ester usage, reduction in CO, UBHC and smoke were observed. The results indicate that the rice bran oil methyl ester can be used directly in compression engine without any modification in the engine...|$|E
40|$|The new {{large-scale}} experimental facility (MARTHA) {{for marine}} propulsion systems, {{built at the}} Laboratory of Marine Engineering (LME) of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA), is presented. The state-of-the-art facility houses two four-stroke, marine diesel engines coupled respectively to hydraulic and <b>electrical</b> <b>dynamometers,</b> allowing for complex, transient loadings. The facility is equipped with automated monitoring, alarm, control and data acquisition systems, facilitating extensive engine performance measurements. The laboratory activities are focused on marine propulsion system research with particular emphasis on experimental and theoretical investigations of engine/load dynamics and control.

5000|$|Brake {{refers to}} the device which was used to load an engine and hold it at a desired {{rotational}} speed. During testing, the output torque and rotational speed were measured to determine the brake horsepower. Horsepower was originally measured and calculated by use of the [...] "indicator diagram" [...] (a James Watt invention of the late 18th century), and later {{by means of a}} Prony brake connected to the engine's output shaft. More recently, an <b>electrical</b> brake <b>dynamometer</b> is used instead of a Prony brake. Although the output delivered to the drive wheels is less than that obtainable at the engine's crankshaft, use of a chassis dynamometer gives an indication of an engine's [...] "real world" [...] horsepower after losses in the drive train and gearbox.|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} to compare the emission characteristics of 20 % orange oil methyl ester and 80 % diesel in volumetric basis with Neat diesel in hemispherical combustion chamber and toroidal combustion chamber. Non-edible orange oil is selected and utilized to prepare alternative fuel to be utilized in Diesel engine. The traditional method of transestrification is employed for preparation orange oil methyl ester. The chemical properties of prepared methyl ester were determined using fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy method. Further its fuel properties were found based on American Society for Testing and Materials standards and compared with Neat diesel fuel properties. A compression ignition engine with <b>electrical</b> <b>dynamometer</b> test rig with gas analyzer has been used. It is observed that 1 % of NOx and 4 % of HC emission reduced in toroidal combustion chamber engine. However, smoke emission is found to be lower in hemispherical combustion chamber engine...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that unloaded shortening velocity (V 0) of human plantar flexors {{can be determined}} in vivo, by applying the ‘‘slack test’ ’ to submaximal voluntary contractions (J Physiol 567 : 1047 – 1056, 2005). In the present study, to investigate the effect of motor unit recruitment pattern on V 0 of human muscle, we modified the slack test and applied this method to both voluntary and electrically elicited contractions of dorsiflexors. A series of quick releases (i. e., rapid ankle joint rotation driven by an <b>electrical</b> <b>dynamometer)</b> was applied to voluntarily activated dorsiflexor muscles at three different contraction intensities (15, 50, and 85 % of maximal voluntary contraction; MVC). The quick-release trials were also performed on electrically activated dorsiflexor muscles, in which three stimulus conditions were used: submaximal (equal to 15 %MVC) 50 -Hz stimulation, supramaximal 50 -Hz stimulation, and supramaximal 20 -Hz stimulation. Modification of the slack test in vivo resulted in good reproducibility of V 0, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0. 87 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 68 – 0. 95). Regression analysis showed that V 0 of voluntarily activated dorsiflexor muscles significantly increased with increasing contraction intensity (R 2 = 0. 52, P, 0. 001). By contrast, V 0 of electrically activated dorsiflexor muscles remained unchanged (R 2, 0. 001, P = 0. 98) among three different stimulus conditions showing a large variation of tetanic torque. These {{results suggest that the}} recruitment pattern of motor units, which is quite different between voluntary and electrically elicite...|$|E
40|$|Dynamometer is a {{measurement}} instrument that functions {{to measure the}} cutting force on a lathe machine. The dynamometer is a measuring of tool that using of a strain gauge sensor of utilizing strain, which occur on the stalk strain as the reader, then it is converted into cutting force. The main {{purpose of this study}} is to produce a dynamometer with type four square stalks for cutting force measurement, dynamometer designed to be able tomeasure the axial force and tangential force. The design process consists of designing, manufacturing and calibration processes. The design step is started from material selection, dynamometer selection and dynamometer dimensional design. The dimensions from design is then drawn detail and analyzed stress. After design process is complete, then the process of making the mechanical components and <b>electrical</b> components <b>dynamometer.</b> Afterthat, the dynamometer is assembled for calibration process. The calibration process consists of hysteresis and repeatability errors. This research revealed the hysteresis for maximum tangential force of 1 milivolt and for maximum axial force of 2 milivolt. The repeatability error was 2 milivolt for the maximum tangential force and maximum axial force of 2 milivolt. Dimension of the dynamometer of type four square stalks was a length of 185 mm and a diameter of 65 mm. The dynamometer can measure maximum force 500 N for axial and tangential force...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of potentiation on stimulation-induced muscle function during and after an intense bout of self-paced dynamic exercise. Ten active subjects performed a time trial involving repetitive concentric extension-flexion of the right knee using a Biodex <b>dynamometer.</b> <b>Electrical</b> stimulation before and after a 5 s maximal isometric voluntary contraction was performed before the start of the time trial and immediately (< 5 s) after each 20 % of the time trial as well as 1, 2, 4 and 8 min after time trial termination. Potentiation was observed before the time trial and as early as 1 - 2 min after the time trial, but no potentiation was detected during or immediately after the time trial for neither single or paired stimuli. At termination of the time trial, “potentiated” peak torque was significantly more reduced than “unpotentiated" peak torque for single stimulus (- 65 ± 10 % and - 42 ± 18 %, respectively) and paired stimuli at 100 Hz (- 51 ± 10 % and - 33 ± 15 %, respectively). Faster recovery for “potentiated” compared to “unpotentiated” peak torque indicate that potentiate peak torque measurements or delay the post-exercise measurements more than a few seconds, will underestimate peripheral fatigue. In conclusion, the potentiation after maximal contraction disappears during intense exercise. Whether the muscle is already potentiated during intense contraction or fatiguing mechanisms inhibits potentiation remains to be clarifie...|$|R
