5|$|Angelou's {{primary role}} in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas was stage performer, but in The Heart of a Woman she changes {{from someone who}} uses others' method of expression—the songs and dances of the African, Caribbean, and African-American oral tradition—to a writer.

For the first time in Angelou's autobiographies, she begins to think of herself as a writer and recounts her literary development. Angelou begins to identify with other Black women writers {{for the first time in}} The Heart of a Woman. She has been influenced by several writers since her childhood, but this is the first time she mentions female authors. Up to this point, her identification <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>with</b> male writers; her new affiliations with female writers is due to her emerging feminism.|$|E

However, in June of the same year, Lukather himself decided to leave Toto. This decision directly led to the official dissolution of the band.

In February 2010, the band announced that they would reunite to support Toto bassist Mike Porcaro, who was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease.

5|$|Low {{back pain}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>with</b> humans {{since at least}} the Bronze Age. The oldest known {{surgical}} treatise – the Edwin Smith Papyrus, dating to about 1500 BCE – describes a diagnostic test and treatment for a vertebral sprain. Hippocrates (c. 460 BCE – c. 370 BCE) was the first to use a term for sciatic pain and low back pain; Galen (active mid to late second century CE) described the concept in some detail. Physicians {{through the end of the}} first millennium did not attempt back surgery and recommended watchful waiting. Through the Medieval period, folk medicine practitioners provided treatments for back pain based on the belief that it was caused by spirits.|$|E

5|$|With few teams, but a long history, it is {{inevitable}} that intense rivalries have developed in Canadian football. Far and away the greatest Toronto Argonauts rivalry <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>with</b> the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and its precursor teams. Fittingly, the Argonauts first game was against a club from Hamilton, while the raucous Eastern Final of 2013—featuring a Tiger-Cat win over the Argos in front of 35,000 at the Rogers Centre—proved the rivalry is alive and well. The two teams meet in Hamilton every year in the Labour Day Classic, a league wide tradition since the late 1940s in which the game's greatest rivalries are showcased.|$|E
5|$|Blaine had briefly {{joined the}} Cheerios {{when it looked}} like New Directions would be {{disbanding}} after their Sectionals loss, and cheerleading coach Sue (Jane Lynch) blackmails Blaine into rejoining; Blaine and Sam hatch up a plan to bring Sue down from the inside. Blaine eventually confesses to Sam that he has feelings for him, to which Sam assures him that he is somewhat flattered by Blaine's honesty and attraction, and that it would not change the fact that Blaine is still Sam's best friend. Blaine still loves Kurt and asks Burt for his permission to propose to Kurt, but Burt tells him they're too young to marry, and advises him to wait. Blaine remains determined, however, and while shopping for a ring, he meets Jan (Patty Duke), a lesbian jeweler who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>with</b> her partner Liz (Meredith Baxter) for over thirty years. Jan offers to be a mentor to him, and Blaine and Kurt later have dinner with Jan and Liz, where Jan and Liz explain how their relationship evolved over the years and their experience with the growing mainstream acceptance of gay people. New Directions wins at Regionals, and Will and Emma get married immediately afterward, with the glee club, plus some graduates including Kurt, in attendance. Blaine is shown, after the ceremony is over, holding a jewelry box behind his back.|$|E

5|$|Federer's {{most notable}} matchup with a compatriot <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>with</b> Stan Wawrinka {{and they have}} played each other 23 times with Federer leading 20–3. Federer leads 6–1 in Grand Slam tournaments, 15–0 on hard courts, 1–0 on grass courts and 4–3 on clay courts. The pair are 1–1 in finals. Their first meeting in the final came at 2014 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters where Wawrinka {{defeated}} Federer in three sets to win his first Masters 1000 title before Federer avenged his loss at 2017 BNP Paribas Open by beating him in the final. While the rivalry is one-sided in Federer's favour, {{the two of them}} have contested some close matches. Wawrinka defeated Federer in straight sets during the 2015 French Open quarterfinals en route to winning his first French Open title, although Federer then won a straight-sets victory in the 2015 US Open semifinals. Other close matches include the 2012 Shanghai Masters and the 2013 Indian Wells Masters, both of which Federer won in three sets, the 2014 Wimbledon quarterfinal which Federer won in four sets, the 2014 ATP World Tour Final semifinal in which Federer won in three sets after saving four match points and the 2017 Australian Open semifinal which Federer won in five sets. Despite their on-court rivalry, they are friends off court and they have played doubles together on numerous occasions, most notably when they won the doubles Olympic Gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2014 Davis Cup.|$|E

The current conductor is Dr. Claire Fox Hillard, who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>with</b> the orchestra since 1991. The MSO will celebrate its 50th anniversary in February 2011 with a performance from Itzhak Perlman.|$|E
5|$|Torres forms a {{friendship}} with Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), the hospital's new chief of cardiothoracic surgery. The two embark on a relationship when Hahn jokingly kisses Torres in an elevator to tease Sloan. Neither <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>with</b> another woman before, and Torres struggles with her bisexuality, and cheats on her with Sloan. She is initially forgiven, but after an argument about work, Hahn resigns from Seattle Grace, ending their relationship. New pediatric surgeon Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) kisses her, and they begin dating. Their relationship is tested when Torres comes out to her father, Carlos, who disowns her, cutting her off both financially and emotionally. When she is not granted a position as an attending, she publicly berates the chief, Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), and resigns from her post. She begins working at the neighboring Mercy West hospital, and when the two hospitals merge, she is promoted to an attending surgeon. Torres' father returns yet again, to condemn her, but ultimately accepts her sexuality. When Torres explains her desire to bear children, Robbins expresses disappointment, and their differing stances on the matter lead them to break up. Soon thereafter, a gunman commits mass murder at the hospital, and, relieved to have survived, Torres and Robbins reconcile, with Robbins agreeing {{that they should have}} children together.|$|E
