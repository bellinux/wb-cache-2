40|$|Abstract—The multi-look polarimetric SAR {{covariance}} matrix is generally modeled by a complex Wishart distribution. For textured areas, the product model is {{used and the}} texture component is modeled by a Gamma distribution. In many cases, the assumption of Gamma distributed texture is not appropriate. The <b>Fisher</b> <b>distribution</b> does not have this limitation and can represent a large set of texture distributions. As an example, we examine its advantage for an urban area. From a Fisher distributed texture component, we derive {{the distribution of the}} complex {{covariance matrix}} for multi-look polarimetric SAR data. The obtained distribution is expressed in term of the KummerU confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind. Those distributions are related to the Mellin transform and second kind statistics (Log-statistics). The new KummerU based distribution should provide in many cases a better representation of textured areas than the classic K distribution. Finally, we show that the new model can discriminate regions with different texture distribution in a segmentation experiment with synthetic textured polarimetric SAR images.

For random variables with <b>Fisher</b> <b>distributions,</b> the ratio distribution is established.

40|$|A focal {{mechanism}} is a geometrical representation of fault slip during an earthquake. Reliable earthquake focal mechanism solutions {{are used to}} assess the tectonic characteristics of a region, and are required as inputs to the problem of estimating tectonic stress. We develop a new probabilistic (Bayesian) method for estimating the distribution of focal mechanism parameters based on seismic wave polarity data. Our approach has the advantage of enabling us to incorporate observational errors, particularly those arising from imperfectly known earthquake locations, allowing exploration of the entire parameter space, and leads to natural point estimates of focal mechanism parameters. We investigate the use of generalised Matrix <b>Fisher</b> <b>distributions</b> for parameterising focal mechanism uncertainties by minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We present here the results of our method in two situations. We first consider the case in which the seismic velocity of the region of interest (described by a velocity model) is presumed to be precisely known, with application to seismic data from the Raukumara Peninsula, New Zealand. We then consider the case in which the velocity model is imperfectly known, with application to data from the Kawerau region, New Zealand. We find that our estimated focal mechanism solutions for the most part are consistent with all available polarity data, and correspond closely to solutions obtained using established methods. Further, the generalised Matrix <b>Fisher</b> <b>distributions</b> we examine provide a good fit to our Bayesian posterior PDF of the focal mechanism parameters, enabling the posterior PDF to be succinctly summarised by reporting the estimated parameters of the fitted distribution...|$|R
