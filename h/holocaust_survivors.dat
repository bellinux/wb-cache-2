5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war, emigration to Israel further decreased the Jewish population of Belgium, which as of 2011 was estimated at between 30,000 and 40,000. The population is still concentrated in Brussels and Antwerp, but new smaller communities (such as those in Ghent, Knokke, Waterloo and Arlon) have developed since 1945. Notable Belgian <b>Holocaust</b> <b>survivors</b> include François Englert, a joint recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013, and Paul Lévy, a well-known journalist (who converted to Christianity) who was also responsible for the design of the European flag.|$|E

5|$|On 4 September 2003, three Israeli Air Force F-15 Eagles {{performed}} a fly-over of Auschwitz-Birkenau during a {{ceremony at the}} camp below. The flight was led by Major-General Amir Eshel, the son of <b>Holocaust</b> <b>survivors.</b> On 27 January 2015, some 300 Auschwitz survivors and other guests gathered under a giant tent {{at the entrance to}} Auschwitz II Birkenau to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the camp's liberation. Attendees included president of the World Jewish Congress Ronald Lauder, film director Steven Spielberg, and world leaders such as Polish president Bronisław Komorowski and King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands. As the number of remaining survivors decreases each year, the attendance at the event is unlikely to be surpassed at future major anniversaries.|$|E
5|$|The old President Warfield was {{eventually}} acquired in early 1947 by Mossad Le'aliyah Bet, a Jewish organization helping <b>Holocaust</b> <b>survivors</b> illegally reach Palestine, then under British mandate. The former Baltimore Steam Packet and U.S. Navy steamship was renamed Exodus when she embarked from France for Palestine on July 11, 1947, carrying 4,515passengers. Two Royal Navy destroyers rammed the Exodus {{as she entered}} Palestinian waters near Haifa on July18. British forces boarded the damaged ship and eventually deported the passengers. The Exodus remained in Haifa harbor until 1952, when the derelict caught fire and burned completely. The 1960 film Exodus depicted the refugees' odyssey aboard the former President Warfield.|$|E

5|$|The State of Israel faced {{enormous}} {{military and}} economic challenges in its early years, and the period from 1948 to 1958 {{was a time of}} food rationing and austerity, known as tzena. In this decade, over one million Jewish immigrants, mainly from Arab countries, but also including European <b>Holocaust</b> <b>survivors,</b> inundated the new state. They arrived when only basic foods were available and ethnic dishes had to be modified with a range of mock or simulated foods, such as chopped “liver” from eggplant, and turkey as a substitute for veal schnitzel for Ashkenazim, kubbeh made from frozen fish instead of ground meat for Iraqi Jews, and turkey in place of the lamb kebabs of the Mizrahi Jews. These adaptations remain as a legacy of that time.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked how}} he, {{as the son}} of <b>Holocaust</b> <b>survivors,</b> felt about Israel’s {{operation}} in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:It {{has been a long time}} since I felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s Credit Suisse began {{catering}} to consumers and the middle-class with deposit counters, currency exchanges and savings accounts. The first branch outside of Zürich was opened in 1905 in Basel. The bank helped companies affected by World War I restructuring, and extended loans for reconstruction efforts. During the 1920s depression, net profits and dividends were halved and employees took salary cuts. After World War II, {{a substantial portion}} of Credit Suisse's business was in foreign reconstruction efforts. <b>Holocaust</b> <b>survivors</b> had problems trying to retrieve assets from relatives that died in concentration camps without death certificates. This led to a class action lawsuit in 1996 that settled in 2000 for $1.25 billion. The Agreement on the Swiss Banks' Code of Conduct with Regard to the Exercise of Due Diligence was created in the 1970s, after a Credit Suisse branch in Chiasso was exposed for illegally funneling $900 million in Italian deposits to speculative investments.|$|E

25|$|Soon after {{descriptions}} of concentration camp syndrome (also known as survivor syndrome) appeared, clinicians observed in 1966 that {{large numbers of}} children of <b>Holocaust</b> <b>survivors</b> were seeking treatment in clinics in Canada.

25|$|Adopt-A-Safta (“Adopt-A-Grandmother”) is an {{organization}} that pairs young volunteers with lonely <b>Holocaust</b> <b>Survivors</b> following the Big Brother/Big Sister model.

According to the Foundation for the Benefit of Holocaust Victims, simple loneliness is the chief complaint of <b>Holocaust</b> <b>Survivors</b> in Israel, and that 35 Survivors die every day, so the efforts of Adopt-A-Safta are ultimately a race against time.|$|E

25|$|In Poland, the Kielce Pogrom (July 1946) {{led to a}} wave of <b>Holocaust</b> <b>survivors</b> fleeing Europe for Palestine. Between 1945 and 1948, 100,000–120,000 Jews left Poland.

Berihah was also responsible for the organized emigration of Jews from Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, totaling 250,000 (including Poland) <b>Holocaust</b> <b>survivors.</b> The British imprisoned the Jews trying to enter Palestine in the Atlit detainee camp and Cyprus internment camps. Those held were mainly <b>Holocaust</b> <b>survivors,</b> including large numbers of children and orphans. In response to Cypriot fears that the Jews would never leave (since they lacked a state or documentation) and because the 75,000 quota established by the 1939 White Paper had never been filled, the British allowed the refugees to enter Palestine at a rate of 750 per month.|$|E
