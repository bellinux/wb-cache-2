25|$|On December 15, 2006, it was {{reported}} that Brian Meehan, director of the private DNA testing lab DSI, had testified that, pursuant to an agreement between himself and Nifong, he had withheld information from DSI's May 12 report, thus producing an incomplete report. Defense attorneys contended that the withheld information was <b>exculpatory</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|E
25|$|The jury began {{deliberations}} on July4. On July5, prosecutors stated that, during deliberations, {{they were}} about to give the jury the corrected information with regard to Bradley's software discrepancy; however, the jury reached a verdict before they could do so. One legal analyst stated that if the jury had found Anthony guilty before receiving the <b>exculpatory</b> <b>evidence,</b> the prosecution's failure to fully disclose it could have been grounds for a mistrial.|$|E
25|$|On March 11, 2014, Ferguson filed a {{civil suit}} against 11 {{individuals}} as well as Boone County, Missouri {{and the city of}} Columbia in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri.

2500|$|On June 16, 2007, the North Carolina State Bar ordered Nifong disbarred {{after the}} bar's three-member {{disciplinary}} panel unanimously found him guilty of fraud, dishonesty, deceit or misrepresentation; of {{making false statements}} of material fact before a judge; of making false statements of material fact before bar investigators, and of lying about withholding <b>exculpatory</b> DNA <b>evidence.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hunt {{was criticized}} for {{allowing}} Darryl Hunt (no relation known) to remain in prison for twenty years after the wrongfully convicted Winston-Salem man was exonerated by <b>exculpatory</b> DNA <b>evidence</b> which pointed to another perpetrator. Darryl Hunt was pardoned by the succeeding Governor, Mike Easley. During his terms in office Hunt oversaw 13 executions (two during his first period in office, 11 during his second), including the first post-Furman execution of a female (Velma Barfield) and the first post-Furman execution in North Carolina (James W. Hutchins).|$|R
25|$|Lathierial Boyd was exonerated and freed in 2013 {{after serving}} 23 years in prison, based on {{evidence}} from Zuley and suppression of <b>exculpatory</b> <b>evidence.</b> He filed a federal civil rights lawsuit, as well as suing the city, saying that Zuley framed him for a murder and attempted murder outside a nightclub in 1990. Anthony Garrett, who received a 100-year sentence for killing a seven-year-old boy, alleged Zuley beat his confession out of him.|$|E
25|$|US District Court Judge in Washington DC Emmet G. Sullivan, on October 2, 2008, {{denied the}} mistrial {{petition}} of Stevens's chief counsel, Brendan Sullivan, due to allegations of withholding evidence by prosecutors. Thus, {{the latter were}} admonished, and would submit themselves for internal probe by the United States Department of Justice. Brady v. Maryland requires prosecutors to give a defendant any material <b>exculpatory</b> <b>evidence.</b> Judge Sullivan had earlier admonished the prosecution for sending home to Alaska a witness who might have helped the defense.|$|E
25|$|By the Act, Congress {{exercised}} {{its power}} to define the rules that should govern this particular area {{in the trial of}} criminal cases instead of leaving the matter of lawmaking to the courts. The Act, and not the Supreme Court decision in the Jencks case, governs the production of statements of government witnesses in a federal criminal trial. The Jencks Act is constitutional as an exercise of congressional power to prescribe rules of procedure for the federal courts. In some instances however, the statute may be overridden by an accused’s constitutional right to disclosure of <b>exculpatory</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|E
50|$|On June 16, 2007, the North Carolina State Bar ordered Nifong disbarred {{after the}} bar's three-member {{disciplinary}} panel unanimously found him guilty of fraud, dishonesty, deceit or misrepresentation; of {{making false statements}} of material fact before a judge; of making false statements of material fact before bar investigators, and of lying about withholding <b>exculpatory</b> DNA <b>evidence.</b> Following the state bar's announcement, Nifong submitted a letter of resignation from his post as Durham County district attorney, that would have become effective in July 2007. However, on June 18, Durham Superior Court Judge Orlando Hudson ordered that Nifong be immediately removed from office.|$|R
500|$|Hodgson's release {{has sparked}} {{debate about the}} use of the death penalty, {{particularly}} about its fallibility. Neil Durkin of Amnesty International commented in a piece for The Daily Telegraph: [...] "e had the deeply sad case of Sean Hodgson, the man from Hampshire who ended up being behind bars for 27years, not least because the prosecution service suppressed <b>exculpatory</b> DNA <b>evidence</b> that could have set him free a decade earlier. He was totally innocent, should never have been imprisoned {{in the first place and}} on release joins the ranks of those– eventually– rescued from their judicial fate". Durkin characterized the Hodgson case as [...] "a warning not to trust a justice system never to be wrong".|$|R
5000|$|The {{murder of}} Linda Cook was {{committed}} in Portsmouth on 9 December 1986. The subsequent trial {{led to a}} miscarriage of justice when Michael Shirley, an 18-year-old Royal Navy sailor, was wrongly convicted of the crime and sentenced to life imprisonment. After serving the minimum 15 years, Shirley would have been released from prison had he confessed the killing to the parole board, {{but he refused to}} do so and said: [...] "I would have died in prison rather than admit something I didn't do. I was prepared to stay in forever if necessary to prove my innocence." [...] (Shirley's conviction was eventually quashed by the Court of Appeal in 2003, on the basis of <b>exculpatory</b> DNA <b>evidence.)</b> ...|$|R
25|$|In Brady v. Maryland it {{was ruled}} that the {{suppression}} of evidence favorable to an accused violates due process, irrespective of the good or bad faith of the prosecutor, where such evidence is material to the guilt or punishment of the accused. The failure {{of the government to}} produce <b>exculpatory</b> <b>evidence</b> may or may not fall {{within the confines of the}} Jencks Act. In some cases, the production of documents must be made at a time prior to that required by the Jencks Act. The Brady rule may require the prosecutor to disclose grand jury testimony prior to trial, if the information is exculpatory, as well as other Brady material.|$|E
500|$|In {{the realm}} of {{criminal}} procedure, this doctrine eventually came to protect the defendant's ability to [...] "present <b>exculpatory</b> <b>evidence</b> and testimony of witnesses". For example, the Court in Brady v. Maryland (1963) used the Due Process Clause to require the state prosecution authorities to disclose evidence that is favorable to a defendant prior to trial.|$|E
500|$|Frankhouser {{was found}} guilty of {{obstruction}} of the federal investigation into credit-card fraud. [...] He was sentenced to three years and a $50,000 fine. After his conviction, he was granted immunity against further prosecution and compelled to testify against LaRouche in the Boston trial. Frankhouser appealed his conviction on April 3, 1989, arguing that his case should not have been severed from the main case, that his counsel had inadequate time to prepare, and that he was not provided with allegedly <b>exculpatory</b> <b>evidence.</b> The appeal was rejected in July.|$|E
5000|$|Woodfox and Wallace {{were convicted}} of the 1972 {{stabbing}} murder of 23-year-old prison guard Brent Miller. (King was said by authorities {{to be linked to}} the murder but was not charged.) According to a July 2013 press release by Amnesty International, Woodfox and Wallace were [...] "convicted of the murder of a prison guard in 1973, yet no physical evidence links them to the crime - potentially <b>exculpatory</b> DNA <b>evidence</b> has been lost and the testimony of the main eyewitness has been discredited. Citing racial discrimination, misconduct by the prosecution, and inadequate defense, state and federal judges overturned Woodfox’s conviction three times, while Wallace’s case is once again up for review before the federal courts." ...|$|R
50|$|After the January 2002 {{decision}} was handed down, Harvey applied to Virginia's Fairfax Circuit Court for DNA testing {{based on a}} 2001 law allowing felons increased access to potentially <b>exculpatory</b> biological <b>evidence</b> that had not previously been subjected to the current DNA testing method. On March 1, 2002, the court ordered the Division of Forensic Science to conduct the testing. On May 15, 2002, after the testing was completed, the division filed a certificate of analysis stating that Harvey could not be eliminated as a possible contributor to the sperm fractions found on the victim. On September 24, 2002, Harvey filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Virginia Supreme Court, challenging {{the validity of the}} certificate of analysis and related test results. The court dismissed the petition on June 10, 2004, saying that it did not have jurisdiction to consider it.|$|R
40|$|This Essay {{takes the}} Supreme Court’s recent {{decision}} in Connick v. Thompson {{as a point}} of departure for examining the efficacy of professional responsibility measures in combating prosecutorial misconduct. John Thompson, the plaintiff in Connick, spent fourteen years on death row because prosecutors concealed <b>exculpatory</b> blood <b>evidence</b> from his defense attorneys. In rejecting Thompson’s attempt to hold the New Orleans District Attorney’s Office civilly liable for failing to train its prosecutors in proper discovery procedures, the Connick Court substantially narrowed {{one of the few remaining}} avenues for deterring prosecutorial misconduct. Implicit in the Court’s reasoning was a belief that district attorneys’ offices should be entitled to reasonably rely on professional responsibility measures to prevent prosecutorial misconduct. This Essay subjects that premise to a searching critique by surveying all fifty states’ lawyer disciplinary practices. Our study demonstrates that professional responsibility measures as they are currently composed do a poor job of policing prosecutorial misconduct. However, we also take seriously the Supreme Court’s insistence that those measures should function as the primary means of deterring misconduct. Accordingly, in addition to noting the deficiencies of professional responsibility measures, we offer a series of recommendations for enhancing their effectiveness...|$|R
500|$|In 2011 the Cook County State's Attorney, Anita Alvarez, {{compelled}} the Office of Conviction Integrity {{to review}} cases of convictions dependent on evidence from homicide detective Richard Zuley of the Chicago Police Department. In 2013, Lathierial Boyd, {{a man whose}} conviction was dependent on Zuley's evidence, won exoneration and freedom after 23 years in prison due to wrongful conviction; {{it was found that}} Zuley had suppressed <b>exculpatory</b> <b>evidence.</b> Reviews of other cases by Zuley were underway. Several civil suits were filed against Zuley, by Bond and by current inmates, who alleged they were convicted based on his framing or coerced confessions.|$|E
500|$|The {{first major}} case that Clifford prosecuted {{was for the}} murder of Boston Brahmin George Parkman, {{and it was one of}} the most sensational of the 19th century. [...] Parkman had {{disappeared}} in November 1849 and Harvard professor John White Webster had been arrested for his murder. [...] The gruesome method of the body's disposal (which was not complete), the fact that it was a capital crime, and the high status of both victim and accused ensured a great deal of public interest in the case, and the courtroom was packed. [...] Clifford's case was complicated by the fact that there was no actual body. [...] Assisted by George Bemis, who had been retained by the Parkman family, he resorted instead to dental forensics and strong circumstantial evidence to build the case against Webster. [...] The jury returned a guilty verdict after two and one half hours of deliberation. [...] There was much controversy afterward concerning the jury instructions given by Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw, but Webster was eventually hanged after confessing the crime. [...] The case has continued to interest legal scholars, in part over allegations that the defense (which included one lawyer lacking significant criminal trial experience) failed to aggressively dispute the evidence presented, and also did not introduce potentially <b>exculpatory</b> <b>evidence.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On March 6, Holder {{testified before}} the Senate Judiciary Committee that the case was [...] "a good use of prosecutorial discretion." [...] Stinebrickner-Kauffman issued a {{statement}} in reply, repeating and amplifying her claims of prosecutorial misconduct. Public documents, she wrote, reveal that prosecutor Stephen Heymann [...] "instructed the Secret Service to seize and hold evidence without a warrant... lied to the judge about that fact in written briefs... withheld <b>exculpatory</b> <b>evidence...</b> for over a year," [...] violating his legal and ethical obligations to turn it over.|$|E
2500|$|Reggie Cole was exonerated in 2009 after {{spending}} 16 {{years in prison}} for a murder he did not commit. [...] With the help of attorney Christopher Plourd and the California Innocence Project, the case against Cole fell apart. [...] CIP filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus on behalf of Cole alleging that Cole's trial attorney failed to investigate and present exculpatory evidence; the prosecution withheld material, <b>exculpatory</b> evidence; false <b>evidence</b> was introduced against Cole at his trial; and the prosecutor engaged in misconduct. [...] On April 8, 2009, Deputy District Attorney Hyman Sisman conceded on Cole's habeas petition that Cole received ineffective assistance of counsel and on April 15, 2009, Judge Jerry E.

40|$|A defendant’s Fourteenth Amendment {{due process}} rights are {{violated}} when {{a state agency}} fails to disclose crucial <b>exculpatory</b> or impeachment <b>evidence</b> — so-called Brady violations. When this happens, the defendant should be provided the means not only to locate this evidence, but also to fully develop it in state post-conviction processes. When the state system prohibits both the means and legal mechanism to develop Brady claims, the defendant should be immune to any procedural penalties in either state or federal court. In other words, the defendant should {{not be required to}} return to state court to exhaust such a claim. Instead, once the federal court finds a viable claim, the court should be allowed to review the claim on the merits and grant relief. Because these claims arise from the failure of state actors to perform their duties properly, the federal courts should forfeit their right to demand adherence to the federal exhaustion requirement. Requiring a defendant to return to state court for exhaustion penalizes the defendant unjustly for a constitutional violation created solely by the state...|$|R
40|$|In United States u.

2500|$|Additionally, Breyer {{wrote that}} the Constitution itself imposed speech {{obligations}} on professional employees. For example, a prosecutor has a constitutional obligation to preserve, and {{to communicate with the}} defense about <b>exculpatory</b> <b>evidence</b> in the possession of the government. Therefore, where there are both professional and constitutional such obligations, [...] "the need to protect the employee’s speech is augmented, the need for broad government authority is likely diminished, and administrable standards are quite likely available." [...] Breyer added that in such cases, the Constitution requires special protection of employee speech, and the Pickering balancing test should apply.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} {{eliminate}} black militant leaders whom they considered dangerous, the FBI {{is believed to}} have worked with local police departments to target specific individuals, accuse them of crimes they did not commit, suppress <b>exculpatory</b> <b>evidence</b> and falsely incarcerate them. Elmer [...] "Geronimo" [...] Pratt, a Black Panther Party leader, was incarcerated for 27 years before a California Superior Court vacated his murder conviction, ultimately freeing him. Appearing before the court, an FBI agent testified that he believed Pratt had been framed, because both the FBI and the Los Angeles Police Department knew he had not been in the area at the time the murder occurred.|$|E
2500|$|The Süddeutsche Zeitung also criticised {{the court}} proceedings, {{claiming}} that <b>exculpatory</b> <b>evidence</b> was ignored {{for the most}} part. In addition, Mollath did not trust his court-appointed lawyer, who found himself nearly incapable of helping his client as a result. Like Müller, the newspaper furthermore contradicted Merk's claim that Mollath's classification as {{a danger to the}} public and his black money allegations {{had nothing to do with}} each other. According to the publication, the assumption of a [...] "black money complex/obsession" [...] was crucial to all verdicts pertaining to Mollath's institutionalisation, beginning in 2006 with the regional court in Nürnberg and influencing even verdicts as late as 2011 and beyond.|$|E
40|$|The American {{criminal}} justice system, though undoubtedly {{one of the}} best in the world, is far from perfect. Every once in a while a notorious case comes along and reveals its uglier side––for instance, its differential treatment of whites and people of color. Such cases often garner huge amounts of national media attention and capture the sustained interest of a normally restless American public. Whatever their outcome, they provide academics with exceptional opportunities to study, learn, and teach about the justice system. They also offer the chance to study related matters, such as the conduct of particular law enforcement and other officials, as well as the underlying causes of crime and the public 2 ̆ 7 s reaction to it. The Duke lacrosse players 2 ̆ 7 rape prosecution is one such case. One evening in March 2006, members of the lacrosse team held an off-campus party where alcohol was served and two erotic dancers were hired to perform. A disagreement broke out between the dancers and the players; later, one of the former, Crystal Mangum, alleged that three players had raped her. Mangum was black and relatively poor; the accused were white and relatively privileged. Up for re-election in a jurisdiction with many African American voters, District Attorney Mike Nifong pursued the case very aggressively. He used questionable identification procedures and was unusually outspoken in numerous local and national media appearances. Even after DNA evidence indicated that the defendants had not engaged in sexual activity with the victim, he declined to drop the charges. Worse, he hid other <b>exculpatory</b> DNA <b>evidence.</b> The case split the Duke campus, the Durham community, and observers at large into sharply divided factions. Desperately trying to preserve its hard-won reputation as an upper-echelon school, the university cancelled the lacrosse season, suspended the three indicted players, and commenced a series of internal investigations. After months of dramatic twists and turns, the North Carolina Bar Association charged Nifong with violating several ethics provisions based on his handling of the prosecution. Within days of being charged, Nifong relinquished the case to the North Carolina Attorney General who, after reviewing the proof, dismissed all remaining charges against the lacrosse players and publicly declared their innocence. After a thirteen-month ordeal, the case was finally over. Eventually, the disgraced Nifong was disbarred.

5000|$|Further, the {{investigation}} into the children's deaths had been inadequate: leads were never pursued, critical questions were not answered, and inconsistencies were never resolved. Remus Griffin, {{a man who had been}} dating the secretary of one of State Attorney Frank Schaub's deputies, [...] "Red" [...] Treadwell, met Lane and his wife at a town meeting called [...] "End the Silence: Free James Richardson", and then took one of the three copies of the complete original file on the case and gave it to Lane. Lane then met with the Governor's counsel and turned the entire file over to the Governor, asking for a full investigation and a hearing on the Richardson case. The Governor, Robert Martinez, appointed the State's Attorney from Miami-Dade County, Janet Reno, to be the special prosecutor on {{the investigation}}. A number of months thereafter, on October 25, 1989, a hearing was held in Arcadia, in the same courthouse where Richardson had been convicted more than 21 years earlier. Lane appeared on behalf of Richardson and Reno appeared on behalf of the State of Florida. Lane argued and Reno agreed that a grievous injustice had been done and the wrong man had been convicted of the crimes. Reno cited the withholding of Brady material from the defense: six separate <b>exculpatory</b> elements of <b>evidence.</b> There was evidence of a cover-up by Sheriff Frank Cline, State Attorney Frank Schaub and his deputy, Treadwell, as well as the local judge. After looking at all of the evidence presented by both sides and noting the inconsistencies and the injustice that had been done in Arcadia over two decades ago, retired Circuit Judge Clifton Kelly said that Richardson had not received a fair trial, and released him into the custody of his attorneys, Lane and the local counsel.|$|R
2500|$|Meanwhile, on April 17, 2009 Bennison's {{attorney}} filed {{a motion}} with the Court for the Trial of a Bishop requesting a new trial, citing newly uncovered <b>exculpatory</b> <b>evidence.</b> According to Bennison's attorney, more than 200 letters, written by the then-teenage female to John, were discovered that contradicted witness testimony at the trial. Bennison's attorney asserted that the letters showed that the teenage girl actively tried to cover up her relationship with John, leaving Charles Bennison unaware {{of the situation and}} therefore unable to take appropriate action.

2500|$|A defense {{attorney}} counsels the accused {{on the legal}} process, likely outcomes for the accused and suggests strategies. [...] The accused, not the lawyer, {{has the right to}} make final decisions regarding a number of fundamental points, including whether to testify, and to accept a plea offer or demand a jury trial in appropriate cases. [...] It is the {{defense attorney}}'s duty to represent the interests of the client, raise procedural and evidentiary issues, and hold the prosecution to its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

2500|$|After {{the passage}} of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, the Supreme Court dealt with a series of cases {{regarding}} the guarantees offered by the Due Process Clause. The first case to evaluate the procedural trial rights of defendants in terms of the Due Process Clause was the 1897 decision in Hovey v. Elliot. In Hovey, the Supreme Court specifically applied the Due Process Clause to fair trial guarantees, holding that due process [...] "secures an 'inherent right of defense'". This doctrine eventually came to protect the defendant's ability to [...] "present <b>exculpatory</b> <b>evidence</b> and testimony of witnesses". For example, the Court in Brady v.
