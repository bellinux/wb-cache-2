40|$|In December 2010 the Treasury Department {{presented}} a proposal contain-ing change in regard of current endowment assurance laws and an alterna-tive way of saving financial instruments called <b>Investment</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Account.</b> The {{purpose of the}} proposal is to make investing in financial instruments easier for private investors and to prevent reigning tax evasion regarding endowment assurances. The objective of this thesis is {{to determine if the}} proposal will have the desired effect of making investments in financial in-struments easier for private investors. The purpose is also to determine whether the changes imposed by the proposal are relevant and adequate. The proposal suggests that the <b>Investment</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Account</b> should be sub-jected to flat-rate tax instead of taxation on capital profit upon divestment of financial instruments, which is the case today. By doing this the investor does not have to calculate expenditure costs of investments making declar-ing tax return to the Tax Agency easier. The proposal also includes change regarding endowment assurance laws stating that deposits and withdrawals should affect the capital base of the assurance preventing tax evasion. Fur-thermore the proposal suggests an elevation of tax on endowment assur-ances conform to the tax-rate of the <b>Investment</b> <b>Savings</b> <b>Account.</b> The proposal shows good intentions since the Treasury Department has ac-knowledged that {{something has to be done}} concerning taxation on capital. However, the execution is in some areas quite poor. Excessive measures are taken in comparison to what is achieved. Calculations are complicated, mak-ing capital profit and taxation unpredictable for private investors. Elevating taxation on endowment assurances within a Swedish tax system which is al-ready high might impede the financial market...|$|E

40|$|The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) was {{established}} under the Provident Fund Act 1991 (Act 452) which provides retirement benefits to its contributors under an efficient and trusted management {{appointed by the}} government. Both private and public sector employees are allowed to contribute; whereby EPF acts as a fund manager {{on behalf of the}} contributors and provides a guaranteed minimum dividend of 2. 5 per cent per annum. Majority of EPF investments are of low risk financial instruments; and this is done as to ensure the contributors enjoy the minimum returns. As majority of EPF contributors are Muslims, two critical issues have risen, especially when EPF seems to be ignorant by not investing in shariah compliant instruments on top of its uncompetitive returns. As gold investment has so far shown to produce high long term investment return, we examined the suitability of introducing shariah compliant gold <b>investment</b> <b>saving</b> <b>account</b> as one of the EPF portfolio investment instruments. We suggested that EPF allocates around 15 per cent of its investment portfolio in shariah compliant gold account for the benefit of EPF contributors as to maintain their purchasing power after retirement. As gold hedges against inflation, investing in shariah– compliant gold investment account solves the dilemma of Muslim EPF contributors in non-permissible investment...|$|R

40|$|No dia a dia, as pessoas sabem que existem várias aplicações financeiras, mas a grande maioria não possui o conhecimento necessário para escolher qual o melhor investimento para o seu dinheiro. E assim, muitas vezes acabam investindo somente na poupança, talvez pela sua simplicidade ou por sua popularidade. Neste trabalho, buscamos mostrar a importância da Matemática Financeira para o entendimento de investimentos. Através de uma abordagem de Progressões Geométrica e Aritmética e, consequentemente, da Matemática Financeira, são apresentadas algumas aplicações financeiras, com seus conceitos, cálculos e atividades que mostram como compará-las. Assim, no trabalho são descritos conceitos e propriedades das Progressões Geométrica e Aritmética, e da Matemática Financeira e, como aplicação desse conteúdo, são apresentados o conceito e o cálculo de diversas taxas (equivalência de taxas, taxas efetiva e nominal, taxa pré e pós-fixada, taxas variáveis, taxa referencial), além de alguns investimentos financeiros (poupança, CDB, LCI). Buscando consolidar esse estudo desenvolvido, apresentamos no final do trabalho uma proposta de atividades a serem {{realizadas}} em sala de aula, que contemplam cálculos da rentabilidade dos investimentos, mostrando ao aluno como calcular e comparar esses rendimentos. Every day, {{people know}} that there are many financial investments but most people don’t have the necessary knowledge to choose which is the best investment for their money. So, they only invest in <b>savings</b> <b>accounts,</b> maybe because it is simpler and the best known way to save money. This work shows the importance of Financial Mathematics for the knowledge about investment. Through an approach of Geometrical and Arithmetical Progression and, hence, of Financial Mathematics, some financial applications and their concepts are presented, with calculations and activities that show how to compare them. Therefore, concepts and properties of Geometrical and Arithmetical Progression and Financial Mathematics are described in this work and, as an application of these ideas, concepts and calculations of several rates are presented (equivalence of rates, effective and nominal rates, pre and post fixed rates, variable rates, referential rate), besides some financial <b>investments</b> (<b>saving</b> <b>accounts,</b> CDB, LCI).

40|$|The {{empirical}} {{literature on}} monetary policy shocks documents that contractionary shocks {{are followed by}} a persistent rise in interest rates and a persistent fall in output. Standard monetary business cycle models can account for the initial effects of monetary shocks, but have difficulty generating persistence. In this paper, I examine whether frictions that affect the asset allocation decisions of households can lead to persistent effects. In the model economy, households hold two assets, one used for transactions (the checking account) and one used for <b>investment</b> (the <b>savings</b> <b>account).</b> There is a small transaction cost for moving funds between the accounts. Another key feature {{of the economy is}} that the business sector accumulates retained earnings and credits profits to the consumers only with a delay. I show that in this environment monetary shocks have persistent effects even when the adjustment cost is very small.

It consists of simulations of different investment strategies, and compares the earnings of an individual without higher education, to the earnings of a person with five years of education. The underlying assumption is that they both have equal consumption while the student is getting his/her degree – i. e. equal to the student income. Averages and estimates where used to establish income figures. The investment amount was the accumulated surplus the person without higher education had compared to the student during his/her education. Two different simulations of investment strategies were applied; <b>investments</b> in a <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> and in a passive index fund. None of the simulations put the person without education ahead in nominal lifetime earnings.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the progression of}} savings between adolescence and young adulthood. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we ask whether the likelihood of having a <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> in young adulthood {{and the amount of}} savings can be significantly predicted by two factors: having a <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> during adolescence and having parents who own assets. Descriptive statistics reveal that adolescents with <b>savings</b> <b>accounts</b> are more often White, employed, and live in households in which the head is married, has more education, and owns assets. Propensity score analyses confirm that young adults {{are more likely to have}} a <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> when they have a <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> as adolescents. Some evidence suggests that adolescents whose parents have savings on their behalf and have higher net worth are more likely to have higher amounts of savings as young adults. Findings suggest that parents play an important role in modeling saving habits for adolescents. Further, our findings suggest that having a <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> in adolescence leads to an increased likelihood of having a <b>savings</b> <b>account</b> in young adulthood; however, this finding requires confirmation in future research...|$|R

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{develop a}} {{framework}} {{to study the}} effects of tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> on the aggregate economy. I incorporate tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> in a theoretical model of household 2 ̆ 7 s life-cycle decisions, which is then linked to the real world data by calibration. I {{study the effects of}} tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> on the aggregate savings and the aggregate output, and further analyze their impacts of different policy changes. In the first chapter, I present the important features of tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> in the U. S. and their institutional changes over time. I highlight the differences between IRA and 401 (k) on their contribution limits and household 2 ̆ 7 s eligibility. While IRA has a lower contribution limit and is available to all households, 401 (k) has a much higher contribution limit but is only accessible by a fraction of households. In the second chapter, I present an overlapping-generations model to capture the effects of tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> in a general equilibrium framework. There are four key aspects to the model: first, households can save in both ordinary <b>saving</b> <b>account</b> and tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>account.</b> Second, there is a nonlinear progressive income tax system. Third, households are heterogeneous in their labor productivity and 401 (k) eligibility. Fourth, households decide consumption, savings and labor supply endogenously. The model is calibrated to the US economy in 2000, with the distribution of 401 (k) eligibility being an endogenous outcome that matches the data reported in Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) in 2001. In the third chapter, I study the quantitative effects of tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> on the aggregate economy and investigate their policy implications. Specifically, I estimate the macroeconomic impacts of eliminating tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> from the economy. To highlight the role played by the heterogeneity of 401 (k) eligibility, I conduct a quantitative exercise that provide universal 401 (k) eligibility to all households. In these experiments, I maintain government revenue neutrality by introducing a new proportional income tax (subsidy) that has the same effects as a upward (downward) shift of all marginal tax rates in the US income tax schedule. Since the institutional settings of tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> essentially provide consumption tax treatments on households retirement savings, I further explore the implications of tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> for a proportional consumption tax reform. Results from this study indicate that tax-deferred <b>saving</b> <b>accounts</b> have significant impacts on the aggregate economy and demonstrate that these accounts substantially reduce the impacts of a consumption tax reform...|$|R
