The result of various governments using CNR as a vehicle for various social and economic policies was a subsidization running into billions of dollars over successive decades.

5000|$|Although {{the period}} from 1837 to 1864 in the US is often {{referred}} to as the Free Banking Era, the term is something of a misnomer, for it refers not to a general system of [...] "free" [...] banking in the literal sense described previously, but rather to various state banking systems based on so-called [...] "free banking" [...] laws, which, though they made it unnecessary for new entrants to secure charters (each of which was subject to a vote by the state legislature), nonetheless restricted their undertakings in important ways. Most importantly, US [...] "free" [...] banks were denied the right to establish branch networks, and had to [...] "secure" [...] their notes by purchasing and surrendering to state banking authorities certain securities those authorities deemed eligible for the purpose. The securities in many cases included bonds of the authorizing state governments themselves; and it has been determined that the depreciation of these very securities was the chief cause of [...] "free bank" [...] failures, and indeed of bank failures generally, during the period in question. The lack of branch banking, in turn, caused state-issued banknotes to be discounted at varying rates once they had traveled any considerable distance from their sources. <b>Depreciation</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> over this period is also used to explain failures. In fact, the high-rate of bank failures during the so-called [...] "free banking era" [...] in the US are attributed by several authors to bank regulation. Then, from 1863 to 1913, known as the National Banks Era, state-chartered banks were operating under a free banking system. Some scholars have found that the system was mostly stable compared to National Banks of that era.|$|E
