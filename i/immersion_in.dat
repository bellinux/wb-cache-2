5|$|Thallium is {{malleable}} and sectile {{enough to}} be cut with a knife at room temperature. It has a metallic luster that, when exposed to air, quickly tarnishes to a bluish-gray tinge, resembling lead. It may be preserved by <b>immersion</b> <b>in</b> oil. A heavy layer of oxide builds up on thallium if left in air. In the presence of water, thallium hydroxide is formed. Sulfuric and nitric acid dissolve thallium rapidly to make the sulfate and nitrate salts, while hydrochloric acid forms an insoluble thallium(I) chloride layer.|$|E

As a corollary, we note that the differential order of a minimal complete set of congruence invariants is bounded by k+ 1. We demonstrate the method by rediscovering the speed and curvature invariants of Euclidean planar curves, the Schwarzian derivative of holomorphic <b>immersions</b> <b>in</b> the complex projective line, and equivalents of the first and second fundamental forms of surfaces in R^ 3 subject to rotation...|$|R
5|$|A {{major theme}} {{of the game is}} heroism, where being a hero may bring more harm than help. During development, there was a point at the {{beginning}} of the game where players could choose to leave Dubai. This was cut from the game, as the team found it not effective enough, and it broke a player's <b>immersion</b> <b>in</b> the game. According to Williams, the choice system was originally designed to be similar to Fable II, where after a player makes a decision, they cannot reload the game and choose differently unless they start a new game. This was later removed due to the game's structure as a shooter, as the team feared that it might make the game unwinnable and cause players to feel frustrated. Williams later added that adding achievements to the game was a mistake, as it disrupts the game's narrative.|$|E

5|$|Cold shock {{response}} is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from <b>immersion</b> <b>in</b> very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has {{to work harder to}} pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Evaluating histologically the {{silicone}} peri-implant coated by polyurethane inflammation {{associated to}} the use of anti-microbial and bacterial contamination. METHODS: It was used 35 Wistar rats. The animals were divided in seven groups: I - Control; II - implant cavity contamination with 10 bacteria/ml; III - implant cavity contamination with 10 bacteria/ml; IV - implant cavity contamination with 10 bacteria/ml; V - identical contamination to group II and implant <b>immersions</b> <b>in</b> anti-microbial solution; VI - identical contamination in group III and implant <b>immersions</b> <b>in</b> the anti-microbial solution; VII - identical contamination of group IV and implant <b>immersions</b> <b>in</b> anti-microbial solution. It was evaluated morphometrically the peri-implant capsules after 30 days of introduction. RESULTS: The factors with more discriminating power were the giants cells of a strange body and the mononuclear. There was no correlation between the bacterial concentrations and the histological alterations. CONCLUSION: 1) The histological standard of the inflammatory reaction around the silicone implant coated with polyurethan is chronic granulomatosis type of a strange body; 2) There isn´t correlation between concentration of Staphylococcus epidermidis and histological changes; 3) The use of anti-microbial solution decreased the mononuclear cell reactions, with the increase of giant cells in a strange body...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{responses}} of 12 volunteers were measured over 3 hour <b>immersions</b> <b>in</b> 50 C water and {{air in a}} calm condition, (Calm) and in a condition that included wind and increased water velocity (Weather). <b>Immersions</b> <b>in</b> the Weather condition resulted in a significantly greater increase in mean skin heat flow (MSHF) compared to Calm. <b>Immersions</b> <b>in</b> the Weather condition resulted in a significantly greater rate of change of mean skin temperature compared to Calm. There {{were no significant differences}} in the rate of change of deep body temperature, mean body temperature, and oxygen consumption between the two conditions. The use of a flume system in this experiment allowed for the successful replication of the increase in heat flow due to waves in a facility that was not capable of wave generation. Wind and waves, and the addition of water underneath the immersion suit, will cause a significant increase in MSHF compared to calm conditions while dry inside the suit. This increase in MSHF may be compensated for by people, but at great effort on their part. When testing people <b>in</b> <b>immersion</b> suit, it is important to consider the effort expended to maintain a stable deep body temperature, and the conditions tested in.

The trend of bands with names drawn from literature, such as the Doors, Steppenwolf and the Ides of March, were a further sign of rock music aligning itself with high culture. Dylan also {{led the way in}} blending rock with folk music styles. This was followed by folk rock groups such as the Byrds, who based their initial sound on that of the Beatles. In turn, the Byrds' vocal harmonies inspired those of Yes, and British folk rock bands like Fairport Convention, who emphasised instrumental virtuosity. Some of these artists, such as the Incredible String Band and Shirley and Dolly Collins, would prove influential through their use of instruments borrowed from world music and early music.|$|E

It is concluded that the mechanisms involved in producing habituation of the initial responses are located more centrally than the peripheral receptors...|$|R
