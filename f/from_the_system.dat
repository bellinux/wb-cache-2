5|$|SR 50, the Paradise Parkway, {{was part}} of Proposition 300 in 1985, but was removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> in December 1994, when then Arizona {{governor}} Fife Symington made some funding cuts that included removal of the Paradise Parkway and Estrella Freeway <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> entirely.

5|$|Although Blanca {{remained}} {{far from}} Jalisco, large swells and rip currents {{produced by the}} hurricane claimed four lives. In Northwestern Mexico, watches and warnings were raised prior to the storm's landfall. Blanca caused generally light damage in the region, consisting of downed trees and power lines. Remnant moisture <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> spread across the Southwestern United States, resulting in several days of scattered thunderstorms. Flash flooding occurred in multiple states, washing out roads and damaging homes, though the overall effects were limited.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the storm}} made {{landfall}} in a sparsely populated area, no deaths {{were reported by}} the NHC. However, one boy was swept away in the Uxpana River and was thus reported missing. Due to flooding caused by the storm, three rivers in Veracruz overflowed their banks. Flooding from the storm also washed-out portions of two Mexico highways. Furthermore, telephone service was interrupted and power outages occurred. Around 1,000 homes were damaged or destroyed and 100 people were injured.

5|$|During its {{weakening}} stage, deep convection {{existed only}} in the northwestern quadrant of the circulation. On August 19, cold cloud tops reappeared, although this brief revival {{has been attributed to}} non-tropical baroclinic instability. At 1200 UTC, the depression was declared extratropical, and it continued northward until dissipating near California a day later. Moisture <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> persisted as it passed through the state and the Pacific Northwest, ultimately merging with a larger extratropical cyclone involving the remnants of Hurricane Guillermo.|$|E
5|$|Green Lake formed {{initially}} as {{a northern}} inlet of San Antonio Bay. As the Guadalupe River shifted westward about 2,500 years ago, it deposited silt, developing a delta that prograded into San Antonio Bay. Around 2,200years ago the delta discharge extended completely across the bay, severing the northern extension <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>system,</b> which formed present-day Green Lake. Pottery and burial grounds {{found in the}} area suggest a presence of Karankawa Indians {{at the time of}} formation. Middens uncovered north of the lake contained shells from the brackish water-species of rangia clams (rangia cuneata).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Danny in August2015 was {{the first}} major {{hurricane}} to develop between the Lesser Antilles and Western Africa since Hurricane Julia in 2010. The hurricane originated from a well-defined tropical wave that emerged over the Atlantic Ocean on August14. Traveling west, the system gradually coalesced into a tropical depression by August18. After becoming a tropical storm later that day, dry air slowed further development. On August20–21, dry air became removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>system,</b> and Danny rapidly intensified into a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Its peak was short-lived as wind shear soon increased and prompted significant weakening. Degrading to a tropical storm by August23, Danny approached the Lesser Antilles. It degenerated into a tropical wave as it traversed the archipelago on August24 and was last noted over Hispaniola the following day.|$|E

5|$|M-87 is the {{designation}} of a former state trunkline highway in the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan, which prior to 1960 ran east–west between the towns of Fenton and Holly. The highway served as a connector between US Highway23 (US23) and the former routing of US10, which ran along {{what is now the}} Interstate75 (I-75) corridor. The highway connected the downtown areas of each community as well as running through then-rural areas of Genesee and Oakland counties. The trunkline was decommissioned in late 1960, removing it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|On August28, a {{large area}} of {{convection}} persisted about 1,035km (645mi) east of Guam. Located within an area of moderate wind shear, the system quickly organized while moving westward, its track influenced by a ridge to the north. At 00:00UTC on August29, a tropical depression formed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>system,</b> classified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) as Tropical Depression 14W. In initial forecasts, the agency anticipated steady strengthening, due to warm sea surface temperatures in the area. At 12:00UTC on August29, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded it to a tropical storm. As such, the JMA named the storm Nabi. About 12hours later, the JMA upgraded Nabi further to a severe tropical storm, after the convection organized into spiral rainbands. At 18:00UTC, Nabi intensified to typhoon status, reaching ten-minute sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph).|$|E

5|$|On June2, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center {{anticipated}} Agatha {{to make landfall}} in Mexico near hurricane strength.

Additionally, heavy rains <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> prompted concerns over mudslides and flash floods.

5|$|One {{definition}} of a sub-brown dwarf is a planet-mass object that formed through cloud collapse rather than accretion. This formation distinction between a sub-brown dwarf and a planet is not universally agreed upon; astronomers are divided into two camps as whether to consider the formation process of a planet {{as part of its}} division in classification. One reason for the dissent is that often it may not be possible to determine the formation process. For example, a planet formed by accretion around a star may get ejected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> to become free-floating, and likewise a sub-brown dwarf that formed on its own in a star cluster through cloud collapse may get captured into orbit around a star.|$|E
