5|$|The path {{continues}} north {{beside the}} Torridge Estuary, in places following {{the route of}} the Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway, past Northam to Appledore and around the promontory past the Shell middens and a submerged forest, that dates from the Mesolithic period, off the pebble ridge to Westward Ho! (this is the only placename in the UK which includes an <b>exclamation</b> <b>mark).</b> The path then follows the coast around Clovelly Bay where several small villages including Abbotsham lie inland, because of the cliffs. The path passes the site of the Iron Age Hill fort at Peppercombe Castle and the village of Bucks Mills. Clovelly itself is a historic village with a small natural harbour. The path continues past the site of the Iron Age Hill fort at Windbury Head to Hartland Point and Hartland Quay. Hartland Point features a lighthouse and radar tower, and marks the western limit (on the English side) of the Bristol Channel with the Atlantic Ocean to the west. There is a winter helicopter service from Hartland Point to Lundy, which is visible from many points along the path between Welcombe and the Cornish border.|$|E

Capitalization of letters tends to mark something for attention and repeating of letters tends to strengthen the emotion. Emoticons are used to help visualize facial expressions which can affect understanding of text. In this paper, we show {{the effect of the}} number of <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks</b> used, via testing with twelve online sentiment tools. We present opinions gathered from 500 respondents towards “like” and “dislike” values, with a varying number of <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks.</b> Results show that only 20 % of the online sentiment tools tested considered the number of <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks</b> in their returned scores. However, results from our human raters show that the more <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks</b> used for positive comments, the more they have higher “like” values than the same comments with fewer <b>exclamations</b> <b>marks.</b> Similarly, adding more <b>exclamation</b> <b>marks</b> for negative comments, results in a higher “dislike”...|$|R
