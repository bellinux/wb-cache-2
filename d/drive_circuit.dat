5000|$|The {{structure}} of an IGCT {{is very similar}} to a GTO thyristor. In an IGCT, the gate turn-off current is greater than the anode current. This results in a complete elimination of minority carrier injection from the lower PN junction and faster turn-off times. The main differences are a reduction in cell size, and a much more substantial gate connection with much lower inductance in the gate <b>drive</b> <b>circuit</b> and <b>drive</b> <b>circuit</b> connection. The very high gate currents and fast dI/dt rise of the gate current mean that regular wires {{can not be used to}} connect the gate drive to the IGCT. The <b>drive</b> <b>circuit</b> PCB is integrated into the package of the device. The <b>drive</b> <b>circuit</b> surrounds the device and a large circular conductor attaching to the edge of the IGCT is used. The large contact area and short distance reduce both the inductance and resistance of the connection.|$|E

ECG measurement using capacitive-coupled electrode (CC-electrode) is a well-known method for unconstrained ECG measurement. Although the CC-electrode {{has the advantage of}} non-contact measurement, common mode noise is increased, which decreases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this study, we proposed non-contact ECG measurement system using CC-electrode and <b>driven</b> <b>circuit</b> to reduce noise. The components of <b>driven</b> <b>circuit</b> were similar to those of driven-right-leg circuit and conductive sheet was employed for driven electrode to contact uniformly to the body over clothes.

40|$|Gate <b>drive</b> <b>circuits</b> {{for power}} MOSFETs and IGBTs often require {{electrical}} isolation. Coreless printed-circuit-board (PCB) transformers {{have been shown}} to have desirable characteristics from a few hundreds of Hertz to a few Mega-Hertz and can be used for both power and signal transfer at low-power level. At low operating frequency, the magnetizing inductance has such low impedance that the driving power requirement could become excessive. This paper describes the use of coreless PCB transformer for isolated gate <b>drive</b> <b>circuits</b> over a wide frequency range. Based on a resonance concept, the optimal operating condition that minimizes the power consumption of the gate <b>drive</b> <b>circuits</b> is developed and verified with experiments. Coreless PCB transformers do not require the manual winding procedure and thus simplifies the manufacturing process of transformer isolated gate <b>drive</b> <b>circuits</b> and low-power converters. Their sizes can be much smaller than those of typical core-based pulse transformers. The electrical isolation of PCB (typically from 15 kV to 40 kV) is much higher than that of an optocoupler (typically 2. 5 kV). link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

A widely used {{rule of thumb}} indicates that cables more than 15 m long will have too much capacitance, unless special cables are used. By using low-capacitance cables, communication can be maintained over larger distances up to about 300 m. For longer distances, other signal standards are better suited to maintain high speed.|$|E

50|$|Another {{latching}} type has a remanent core that {{retains the}} {{contacts in the}} operated position by the remanent magnetism in the core. This type requires a current pulse of opposite polarity to release the contacts. A variation uses a permanent magnet that produces part of the force required to close the contact; the coil supplies sufficient force to move the contact open or closed by aiding or opposing the field of the permanent magnet.

50|$|Chain {{printing}} {{allowed a}} single set of characters to pass horizontally {{across the front}} of paper at high speed, with a ribbon the full width of the paper passing vertically in between the chain and the front of the paper. Instead of pressing the characters toward the paper, individual type hammers behind the paper, one for each column on the page (120 or 132), pushed the paper from behind, causing the front of the paper at that spot to push forward into the ribbon with the character behind it, causing the paper to strike the character, {{rather than the other way}} around, as had been done in the past.

50|$|Although many {{variations}} exist, a plasma lamp {{is usually}} a clear glass sphere filled {{with a mixture of}} various gases (most commonly neon, sometimes with other noble gases such as argon, xenon and krypton) at nearly atmospheric pressure. They are driven by high-frequency (approximately 35 kHz) alternating current at 2-5 kV. The <b>drive</b> <b>circuit</b> is essentially a specialized power inverter, in which current from a lower-voltage DC supply powers a high-frequency electronic oscillator circuit whose output is stepped up by a high-frequency, high-voltage transformer. The radio-frequency energy from the transformer is transmitted into the gas within the globe through an electrode at its center. A much smaller hollow glass orb can also serve as an electrode when it is filled with metal wool or a conducting fluid that is in communication with the transformer output. In this case, the radio-frequency energy is admitted into the larger space by capacitive coupling right through the glass. Plasma filaments extend from the inner electrode to the outer glass insulator, giving the appearance of moving tendrils of colored light within the volume of the globe (see corona discharge and electric glow discharge).|$|E

He won several more club level championships but the closest he came to winning a national championship title was when he finished runner-up, for Project One Racing, in the 2005 Super 1 National Formula TKM Extreme Championship, finishing 37 points behind Adam Constable in the final championship standings. He also won the Renault Champion of Champions title in 2005. His kart career ended in December 2007 with a victory at The PF International circuit in Lincolnshire driving a Gillard chassis for Project One Racing in the popular Rotax Max class.
