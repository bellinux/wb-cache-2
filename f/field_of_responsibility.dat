50|$|The term provincia {{referred}} to a <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility,</b> rather than a geographical administrative area. For example, the judicial responsibility of the urban praetor, who was a chief justice, was called provincia. The term often applied to military responsibility and was {{used to refer to}} the areas of military responsibility assigned to the consuls to deal with rebellions or threats of invasions; in other words, the area where imperium was exercised. It was in the Late Republic that the term provincia also {{referred to}} an administrative area outside Italy. When provinces in the modern sense of the word were established, they were originally the areas where the promagistrates exercised their military power. These governors performed judicial roles in arbitrating disputes between Romans and locals and between the local themselves. They gave the final pronouncements in cases where the laws of the locals did not apply or when there was an appeal. The foundation of this was the governor's ability to enforce his rulings through his military power. In theory, the Senate was meant to supervise the governors, but the distance of many provinces from Rome made this impracticable.|$|E

40|$|Background One of {{the main}} demands on Swedish and global health care in general is to meet the patient’s need for safety. By general health care law this also {{comprises}} district nurses’ <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility.</b> Although there are numerous studies describing the concept of safety and its different shapes, no research could be found exploring how safety is, or supposed to be, mediated by district nurses’ in a Swedish context. Research about this is therefore needed. Aim The aim of this qualitative {{study was to explore}} how district nurses’ mediate safety to their patients. Method Qualitative data were collected from seven district nurses’ by means of semi structured interviews. Thereafter, a concept analysis was carried out. Results Responses revealed that district nurses’ consider themselves mediate safety through a variety of ways. Five major categories emerged: (1) complaisance’s; (2) competence; (3) patient participation; (4) same caregiver; (5) personal characteristics. Conclusion District nurses’ mediate safety through a combination of general attitudes and concrete acts. Preconditions are bound to each district nurse’s individual ability to give a good complaisance, his/her competence and ability to involve patients in treatment and care. Other, less pronounced, are bound to the district nurse’s ability to create continuity in contact with patients’ and his/her personal characteristics...|$|E

40|$|Background: The project {{controller}} is {{a function}} witch evolved due to the strong gaining ground of project operation. Why {{the area of the}} project controller is interesting to study is {{explained by the fact that}} increasing knowledge of this function is important in order to make project operation work well. The fact that opinions in this field disagree, further increases the interest of the field. In order to study the function of the project controller three companies have been singled out. They are IFS, Intentia and Saab Bofors Dynamics. The selection is based upon them being knowledge based companies with project intense operation. Aim: The aim with this study is to compare and analyse the function of the project controller in three project intense knowledge based companies. Method: This study is based upon three methodological bases being qualitative study, case study and interview. As a complement to the interviews, document analysis have been used. Result: The <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> of accounting controllers is still of great importance, but can be seen as a smaller part of the collected project controller functions. A new area for the function of the project controller stresses constitutes of interaction, which both directly and indirectly supports project control. In the interactive function, both offensive and defensive functions are included, which can be conceived paradoxically. Furthermore the function of the project controller is rather influenced by how companies organise and structure the management control than the importance of the project operation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss {{challenges}} for staff in Higher Education encountering students in disabling conditions. The study takes a point of departure in a series of workshops designed to strengthen the competence among staff at Malmö University to develop inclusive learning environments in their <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility.</b> The research questions concern the participants’ understanding of what constitutes an inclusive learning environment and their preparedness for acting in line with rights for people with disabilities to an education free from discrimination. Content analysis from field notes taken in dialogues with the participants showed that barriers exist e. g. due to procedures in order to get a statement qualifying to support as well as not having a statement meaning that the student becomes carrier of her/his own problems, responsible for telling each staff member about the disabling conditions and needs. Tension appeared in the analysis between giving support to the individual student and a proactive problem solving in a flexible learning environment to the benefit of all students. Principles of equal access and widened participation are not easily applied leading to the conclusions that further efforts need to be made to disseminate existing knowledge in the field and moreover to identify knowledge gaps by involving students, coordinators of support and other staff in different survey studies. The framework for the coming studies is anchored in theory and practice developed in Universal Design for Learning focusing staff development and students’ sense of belonging when facing disabling conditions in higher education...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} 20 years, a {{deliberate}} strategy of impoverishment of local governments argued the imperative need of: a) involving at all (public) costs, {{the private sector}} through the “trojan horse” of governance (Miraftab 2004); b) designing big and shortsighted urban projects (frequently destroying public resources and ignoring public needs) through the mantra of the urban and territorial competition. As it has been already noted, “by elevating Governance above Government, and Economics above Politics, the globalpolicy undermined nation- and state-building capacities in many Countries” (Demmers, Jilberto, Hogenboom, 2004). Moreover, through the rhetoric on pluralism, the neo-liberal governance has contributed to shrink and destroy the relevanceof public interest. In fact, behind the 'screen' of governance and the representation of an amorphous citizenship and a notqualified of diffuse interests, the deployment of capitalism has prevailed. This legitimized the partial and strongest interests into shaping the public agenda within the polarized inequalities. In thisframework, the paper will give some suggestions and advices for rethinking current problems, and {{trying to deal with}} them,by starting by the critical evaluation of some words we use. Moreover, by focusing on the ethic of responsibility andaccountability of planners (and for most of us as planning scholars), the paper argues that a stronger role for planners andplanning scholars has to do with our own <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>responsibility</b> (such as professionals/practitioners/scholars), andmoreover with our commitment in building and using new theories and research approaches at least to: a) incorporate the ‘others’/minorities by considering furthermore the interaction between capitalism accumulation in space and the minorities (Yiftachel 2013); b) improve critical urban theories mixing with place-based planning and research practices (Campbell 2012; 2014), by applying different approaches; c) co-produce (Watson 2014) a public model of development, being aware of the oligopolistic elites and extractive institutions (Acemouglou, Robinson, 2012) ...|$|E
