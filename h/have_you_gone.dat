6000|$|He {{recalled}} his mind from the retrospective pain to the practical matter before them. [...] "I would <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to Mrs. Charmond," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Enough said," [...] replied Hildebrod; [...] "and now I would <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to my house, and get {{something}} hot--you will be but dreary here by yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would rather}} not <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> near that tree. Come over to {{this side of the}} path, and keep on this side till you get by." ...|$|R
6000|$|She did {{not answer}} that. She sat quite still looking in front of her. [...] "WHY <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>gone</b> over?" [...] she asked {{abruptly}} as though I had said nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{a terrible}} little fool you are! That fellow's a millionaire--he's a nephew of old Van Skittles himself. And {{he was talking}} on the level, too. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>gone</b> crazy, Nance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{young lady}} {{in my study}} {{at this time of}} night!" [...] Wolfenden exclaimed, incredulously. [...] "Who is she, and what is she, and why has she come at all? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>gone</b> mad, Selby?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My {{father would}} <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> forth as a knight-errant, Micah,' said Reuben, laughing. 'You might {{chance to get}} your own skin beaten and your own leather tanned.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid to}} <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> {{even for a}} day," [...] she admitted, with simple honesty, which moved him deeply. [...] "I don't know what I should do if <b>you</b> <b>went</b> away. I think of nothing but you now." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Eunice Carr! <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>gone</b> {{clean out}} of your senses? It's the {{smallpox}}--the smallpox! If he's got it he'll {{have to be taken}} to the smallpox hospital in town. You shan't stir a step to go to that house!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is all right, sentry, you can go," [...] Easton said, {{recovering}} himself {{first from}} his astonishment; and then saying {{as soon as}} they were alone: [...] "What on earth does this masquerade mean, Clinton? <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>gone</b> out of your mind?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{would break}} {{my heart to}} <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> in that way, Ben. Stay at least till your innocence is proved, then no one can doubt what you say now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{reason that}} I fear to <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to the village," [...] she said, [...] "is that I am quite {{sure they would}} catch you and shave off your beard." ...|$|R

6000|$|ROBERTS. [Venomously.] Justice from London? What are {{you talking}} about, Henry Thomas? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>gone</b> silly? [THOMAS is silent.] We know very well what we are--discontented dogs--never satisfied. What did the Chairman tell me up in London? That I {{did n't know what}} I was talking about.

6000|$|... "Assuredly, Comrade Parker. There must be no secrets, no {{restraint}} between us. I {{would not}} <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> away {{and say to}} yourself, 'Did I make my meaning clear? Was I too elusive?'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said she. [...] "Cherry has {{got up on}} the rocks. Caleb spied her there; he will shew you where, and I {{should like}} to <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> and drive her down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Alfred Burton," [...] she continued, impressively, [...] "for {{the dear}} land's sake, what's come over you?

If you love me, it's a crime to marry him. Women do these things, I know--sell themselves. But they kill their souls. If you could save your father from being hanged, {{it would still be}} wrong. Suppose he did go to jail for a few years. What's that {{compared}} to hell for you all your life? You're out of your head. You've lost your sense of proportion.... You must care for this damned skunk Dick Hardman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What I want to know, Alfred Burton, {{is first}} {{how long this}} tomfoolery is to last, and {{secondly}} what it all means?"

6000|$|... "Assuredly, Comrade Parker. There must be no secrets, no {{restraint}} between us. We {{would not}} <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> away {{and say to}} yourself, 'Did I make my meaning clear? Was I too elusive?' Say on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is better," [...] said she, {{smiling at}} our laughter. [...] "I would not <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> back to Friar's Oak with long faces, {{or maybe they}} would not let you come to me again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could hardly}} bear to <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> away," [...] said Mrs. Dare. [...] "It {{would be so}} lonely--your father and you both out of the house. I would rather <b>have</b> <b>you</b> home, {{even if we had}} a good deal less to live upon." ...|$|R
